its awesome. i loved the main charectors.",1000425600,,95,4.333333333333333
1630980,5,B00005NBDH,"""Just Visiting"" delivers! I really wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw this movie, and I found myself cracking up the entire time. I thought the cast was great, with good chemistry and, although I wouldn't be expecting any Academy Award nominations, the acting was decent.
If you're looking for something to push your intelligence to the max, look elsewhere. But if you'd like some good, clean entertainment that you can enjoy after a trying day, ""Just Visiting"" is for you!",1000252800,13,482,4.819277108433735

1631004,5,B00005NBDH,I wish Ive seen this movie sooner. Ive always been a fan of Christine Applegate and I always loved her in Dont Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead and of course Married With Children. She's so super talented. After finding out I'm related to her and her 7th cousin I was astonished!  This movie is right up my alley since I do ancestry and her ancestor coming from the past of the 12th century France and running into her is a fantastic story. It was original. They didn't know what anything is we have nowadays and when they get to the millennium and  and its so funny.,1499731200,,564,4.311320754716981

1631006,3,B00005NBDH,I am a big fan of Christina Applegate.  Which was why I saw this movie in the first place.  It turns out that I think that this is her best movie.  It starts off in 12th Century France.  And through time travel ends up in the 21st Century.  The real star of the movie is Christian Clavier who easily steals the whole movie.  He has the funniest scene when they go out to eat in a five star restaurant.  But there are a lot of funny scenes like the bath tub the light switch and the horse on the L.  Also  in an homage to Married With Children there is a scene where the fountain that is shown at the beginning of Married With Children shows up.  The  performances by everybody is good.  Including another scene at the very end when Tara Reid and Clavier channel their inner Sonny and Cher.,1498521600,,789,4.152317880794702
1631007,5,B00005NBDH,The Blu Ray conversion is great. I am still amazed at how many people still have not seen this movie... This movie is so funny. If you haven't seen it... you need to see its a gem.,1493596800,,180,3.891891891891892

they are both fantatstic and kids love them to pieces. Absoulutely fabulous to watch
for the whole family.

she is just beyond brilliant! Amazing acting.",1485129600,,550,4.622448979591836

1631045,1,B00005NBDH,"This is a really stupid movie.  I found it to be unwatchable to the point where I had to turn it off.

1) The movie starts with an endless droning voice over that made Cate Blanchett's voice for the LOTR seem like Shakespeare.  Inane voice overs should NEVER start movies, especially ones that last for several minutes.

2) The director seemed to find farts, filth, toilets and fecal matter to be incredibly amusing.  While I think such humor has it's place, that place isn't every 10 minutes.

3) Every character was predictable and a cliche.  Jean Reno NEVER gets beyond being ignorant, we know from the start that Applegate and her fiance will never get married because she has morals and he doesn't (although we never know they were getting married in the first place), and we know that Reno's servant and the girl next door will get together.  (Indeed the servant-next door neighbor subplot is annoying and pointless to the whole film, but apparently it was important to someone.)

4) The joke about Reno and is servant being ignorant of the 20th century gets used...over and over and over...and you guessed it, over and over again.  If you saw the Beverly Hillbillies TV show, you will tire of it the first time.  If not, it may take a couple scenes.  The kitchen scene and the toilet scene and the bed scene and the restaurant scene are all---each on their own merit---done to the point of complete over kill.  It's almost as if the director thinks the audience is as ignorant or stupid as the characters.

I don't recommend this at all.  (BTW, I am a Jean Reno fan, and I highly recommend that fans of his work avoid this movie at all costs.)",1473552000,,1650,4.5646258503401365

1631049,4,B00005NBDH,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it many years ago. Christina Applegate is at her finest and it is impossible not to be charmed by her character. Reno & Clavier play over-the-top characters with hardcore schtick, but it works because it blends perfectly with the absurdity of the situation. It's like comfort food to watch this movie whenever the mood strikes. Five-Stars for a laid back silly popcorn movie.

The blu-ray is pretty straight forward and stripped down. You can select play movie, and that's it! Furthermore there are no subtitles if you want to watch at low volume, but I guess we can at least be thankful there are chapters so you can skip ahead (although there is no scene selection menu). The transfer itself is decent, not that you need hi-def for this movie - so thanks to Mill Creek for at least providing that. Still, despite its lack of even a single bell or whistle its nice to finally have this guilty pleasure on blu-ray.

Overall I'm giving it four stars because I would like at least some extras, or at least a main menu with more than just 'play'. Great movie and a great addition to the collection for 5 or 6 bucks!",1468972800,2,1161,4.497630331753554

I also have ""The Visitors"" (1996) with Christian Clavier  & Jean Reno;

IF Peter Sellers made a time travel movie, it COULDN'T be any more enjoyable to watch.

Mr. Reno does a great job of a person trying to retain a 12th century mindset while confronted with 21st century ""culture.""  He reminds us that people in the 12th century were not stupid, just, well, in the 12th century!

His aid (a serf) is very slapstick, and you will crack-up over the scenes involving the ""magic blue fountain"" and forest fresh mints!  Christina Applegate does well with deadpan humor.  There is a subtle, almost wistful undertone surrounding past times when men were honorable and brave, despite the totally outrageous plot. The very few vulgarities are often delivered with French accents and there are no sex scenes, so I suggest this is one the whole family can enjoy.",1428537600,,826,4.715277777777778

1631192,4,B00005NBDH,"This is a remake of the hilarious, top-grossing French film Les Visiteurs from 1993. The plot is similar, and several members of the original cast (Jean Reno and Christian Clavier) reprise their roles, although the valet is now called Andr le Pate. Several other reviewers have ably described the plot, so I won't, except to describe some main comparisons I have.  One of the joys of the French original film were the hilarious plays on words between the medieval French of the 12th century, and the modern French spoken today.  Having our French characters transported to modern day Chicago, of course, precludes this sort of word play but there are still many vagaries of modern English that provide humor.  The visitors' discovery of modern conveniences (plumbing, cars, subways, food, clothing, phones, tv, etc) provide for many sight gags and outstanding comedy. As a stand alone film, this movie is a family-friendly comedy.  As a remake of the original French film Les Visiteurs, Just Visiting holds its own and is a satisfying story. As a French teacher, I do prefer the original film, but I know my students would love the English language remake as well.",1409356800,,1164,4.953846153846154

The plot situation of a medieval knight and his servant magically appearing in modern times created a series of extremely hysterical situations.  Simple things like riding in a car on a freeway at current day speeds was well done and so funny as the knight and his squire look green as things flash past the windows. The wizard was another character that added to the fun with his yellow suitcase and cowboy boots.

This is my review on Just Visiting.

I love mideval movies one day I was flipping through the channels on the tv & came across this movie.  I loved it. I have it on the DVR & watch it almost every day.  It's hilarious Jeno Reno I never get tired of watching of him he's a excellent actor.  This movie is so funny these two guys get sent to future from the mideval times era I love this it's hilarious.

Jean Reno, Christina Applegate, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!

I belive this is why the film bombed in theaters, which upsets me greatly. This film is hilarious! Anyone who enjoys comedy should see this on VHS or DVD.

Medieval French knight Count Thibault is engaged to marry English Princess Rosalind. However, a rival, Earl of Warwick, schemes to have Thaibault bumped off so he can marry Rosalind instead. The Earl gets a potion from a witch that will cause whoever drinks it to have nightmarish hallusinations. The Earl's plan is to have Rosalind drink it, then see Thibault to be a monster and kill him. However, at the banquet something the Earl never expected happens: after tainting the Princess' cup without anyone eles knowing, Rosalind has Thibault drink from her cup while she drinks from his as a sort of romantic celebration, whitch causes Thibault to end up killing her. Thibault is thrown in the dungeon and sentenced to be executed the next morining, but he sends his manservant, Andre le Pate, to find an English wizard to try to find a way to set things right. Andre is able to bring one back in the nick of time, and the wizard devises a spell to open the gates of time. The plan is to send Thibault back a few hours to just before Rosalind was killed and prevent her death. However, this wizard proves to be rather absent-minded, and sends both Thaibault and Andre not back but forward-all the way to the year 2000!

1631356,2,B00005NBDH,"""Just Visiting"" has some positive things about it.  The special effects are original & entertaining.  I particularly enjoyed when Andre the servant was transported back in time & inflated like a balloon.  Malcom McDowell had a very colorful pair of boots!  The witchcraft-induced fantasy sequence at the feast was imaginative.  This film can capture a child's attention.  Mine usually wanders off disinterested, but watched it all. Jean Reno as Count Thibault of Malfete looks very French.  However, he's a bit tough to buy as a romantic lead opposite Christina Applegate.  I know he was signed because he starred in the French version, but the chemistry with Christina doesn't click, proof being Julia falls for a young cute attorney at the end who does catch her eye.  When Reno's transported to the future, there is no elegance of nobility.  Christian Clavier's antics of sitting on the floor of LaTour eating like a dog, skewering a raw chicken on an umbrella & roasting it in the fire, washing from the toilet, for me was over-the-top & not funny.  Matt Ross as the boyfriend Hunter cheats on Applegate with a beautiful blonde who writhes like a cat in heat on the tabletop.  This was unbelievable and tasteless.  We certainly believe when Julia breaks up with Hunter; but what did she see in him in the first place?  Malcom McDowell is a fine actor who walks through the paces of this half-baked farce.  The French countryside is beautiful.  Why the wizard transports the count to Chicago is a total mystery.  If you don't care if a movie makes sense and someone drinking out of a toilet makes you giggle, this film will find a niche.  I'd prefer Kate & Leopold.  TAXI!",1031875200,6,1675,4.7735191637630665

1631372,2,B00005NBDH,"This film is a good example of why French films often don't make the transition to American films.  The 1993  French original, ""Les Visiteurs,"" was for many years the all time box office champion in France. It succeeded on a number of levels.  First, it was a clever time travel film about a French knight and his serf who travel from medieval days to modern day France and meet their ancestors -- a Back To The Future in reverse.  Second, it was a charming fantasy with almost Disney like qualities, especially in the 20th century, when our French knight and his serf find kind and sympathetic help from Beatrice, the only one among their descendants who really believes who they are.  Third, and perhaps most significant, it was a clever satire about French society.  Imagine when our medieval knight makes it to modern times only to discover that his castle is now owned by the descendants of his serf.  What follows is a delightful story that is a humorous and often poignant commentary on who and what we are.  Sadly, most of that was lost in this American remake --not that the producers didn't try to retain the same magic.  They brought in the same two principal actors, and much of the same production crew.  It appears, however,  that they made one big mistake in the hiring of John Hughes as a writer.  What you see here looks too much at times like a Chicago based John Hughes brat pack movie and not enough like an ingenious comedy satire.  In addition, much of the Disney like awe and fantasy are also gone.  (Ironic, since this was a Disney film.)  Instead, the American actors who were added to the cast for the remake are too hip and streetwise to care as much as they should about what they are experiencing.  (So why then should we care?)  Given all of the rewriting going on in Hollywood these days, it may or may not have been all John Hughes' fault.  Nevertheless, a real opportunity was squandered here,  and what was so powerfully stated in the original film was lost in this translation. What we learn about film making once again is that writing is the key element. In the case of adapting a foreign film, it takes an intimate  understanding of both cultures to pull it off.  When it works, it can be wonderful.  Other times, not so wonderful, as in this film.",1007942400,7,2286,4.524390243902439

 The movie it's mainly about the clash of cultures and times between the medieval age and twenty-first century. The knight's and servant's lack of knowledge about our appliances and technology are what make the movie so funny, since the way that people used to live so long ago doesn't compare at all to the life in the big apple.

1631376,4,B00005NBDH,"Magic, as well as evil,  is afoot in 12th Century France, and when the two are combined to effect the sinister scheme of an unscrupulous individual the result is a comedic journey for a Nobleman and his lackey as they are transported into the 21st Century in ""Just Visiting,"" directed by Jean-Marie Poire, and starring Jean Reno and Christina Applegate.  Count Thibault (Reno) is about to marry Princess Rosalind (Applegate), daughter of King Henry (Richard Bremmer) and his Queen (Sarah Badel), but at a prenuptial banquet the Earl of Warwick (Robert Glenister), who covets the fair Rosalind, coerces a witch (Valerie Griffiths) into casting a spell that will enable him to usurp Thibault and make Rosalind his own.  The plan goes gravely awry, however, and Thibault subsequently engages the talents of an English Wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to set things aright.  But the Wizard proceeds to muck it up even worse, sending Thibault and his slave, Andre le Pate (Christian Clavier), into a ""Tunnel of time"" from which they ultimately emerge in Chicago, 2001, where they encounter Julia Malfete (also Applegate), the spitting image of Rosalind, who turns out to be a direct descendant of Thibault.  And it becomes the task of the Nobleman, Thibault, to find a way back to his own time.  In the meantime, he and Andre attempt to negotiate this world of the future with a Medieval mind-set that puts them at odds with the inanimate objects and humans that surround them.  And it becomes a trial by fire for the brave Count, and a laugh riot of uproarious proportions for the audience.
 This stranger-in-a-strange-land, fish-out-of-water scenario has been done before, to be sure, but it's given a fresh face here compliments of Poire, who sets a good pace and keeps the story on track, and the talents and impeccable comedic timing of his cast, especially Clavier and Reno, who play so well off of one another.  Much of what transpires is predictable-- the way Thibault and Andre react to a modern city replete with technology, and specifically things like automobiles, light switches and television-- but they always manage to take it one step further, which makes the humor spontaneous and genuinely funny.
 Reno is perfect as Thibault, playing it straight and allowing the humor to naturally evolve from the character's reaction to a situation rather than going for the purely physical humor.  Reno, in fact, demonstrates a real talent for acting through reacting, which makes his character believable and adds to the humor of the film.  He never allows Thibault to lose that 12th Century logic, willing to attest to his own nobility, for example, to anyone who will listen, and backing it up with a verbal inventory of his assets, which includes things like fifty barrels of olives and, of course, Andre.  It's not a performance that requires a lot of depth, but for the film to work it had to be done right, and with precision, and Reno succeeds admirably on both counts.
 Clavier, on the other hand, goes straight for the jugular with an all-out assault of slapstick and physical humor that takes it right to the edge and works perfectly in effecting what was intended:  He makes you laugh out loud.  Reminiscent of a cross between Peter Sellers' Clouseau-- though not as subtle-- and the best of Monty Python, Clavier creates a memorable character, who as the ""property"" of Thibault gives a real perspective and context to the humor of the story.  Some of his ""discoveries"" of the modern world will have you rolling on the floor.  And again, the fact that he plays the character straight and not just ""for"" laughs adds significantly to the overall humor of the film.
 Christina Applegate provides a welcome presence as Rosalind/Julia, and while not a stretch for her as an actor, by any means, she lends a quality to the film that could be easily overlooked, but would be quite apparent as a missing element without her.  She has a natural, charismatic manner that makes her endearing and sympathetic, and it's a good, solid performance through which she creates a credible, well rounded character.
 The supporting cast includes Matt Ross (Hunter), Tara Reid (Angelique), Bridgette Wilson (Amber), John Aylward (Byron), George Plimpton (Dr. Brady), Bill Bailey (Thibault's Father) and Clare Welch (Thibault's Mother).  A comedy that successfully blends the fine art of comedic subtlety with physical gags, ""Just Visiting"" is everything a comedy should be:  Funny and entertaining.  And it does it without venturing into over-the-top Farrelly Brothers territory or by employing the abstract brand of hilarity often offered by the Coen Brothers.  It's a film that succeeds on it's own merits, and does it splendidly.  It's a funny one you don't want to miss, and that's the magic of the movies.",1001203200,34,4794,4.976190476190476
