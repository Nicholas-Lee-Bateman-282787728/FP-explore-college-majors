8568075,5,B00BGFKXMI,"Luiz Gonzaga ""O Rei de Forro"" was one of the great musicians of Twentieth Century Brazil.  He was as much a force of nature as he was a great musician and composer.  Decade after decade, Gonzaga produced memorable songs that passed onto the iconic.  ""Gonzaga de Pai Pra Filho"" is a big budget Brazilian film recounting the life of Luiz Gonzaga and his troubled relationship with his son and fellow talented musician Gonzaginha.  The film has everything you would expect from a big budget production.  Charismatic actors, great charm and above all, it beautifully captures the feel of Brazil.  Highly recommended for any fan of Brazilian cinema or music.",1503273600,,653,4.944954128440367
8568076,5,B00BGFKXMI,"I nabbed this DVD in Brazil in 2013. For some reason, I never got around to watching it until last night. The DVD has English subtitles. Below is a short summary and review.

From [...] The 2012 Brazilian film, Gonzaga - De Pai Pra Filho (Father to Son), is the story of Luiz Gonzaga's son reconnecting with his father after years of estrangement. The events take place in 1981 when Gonzaga Sr., ""The King of Baio,"" is nearly broke and at the lowest point in his career. In an attempt to reach Jr. (nicknamed Gonzaguinha and Luizinho), Gonzaga Sr. reveals the story of his life to his son for the first time. As with most biopics, the events are told through a painterly lens of part-legend and part-truth. The costumes, acting, set design, cinematography and music are exceptional. While the film is sentimental and dramatic, it does not play as melodrama. The director, Breno Silveira, grounds the mythic Gonzaga Sr. in reality by allowing him to be a flawed human being. For fans of northeastern Brazilian music, Gonzaga - De Pai Pra Filho is essential. Additionally, it will give foreigners a rare glimpse into the pop culture history of Brazil, especially northern Brazil, which has been unjustly hidden.",1460332800,2,1209,4.8125
8568077,5,B00BGFKXMI,"Gonzaguinha is my favorite Brazilian singer of all time.. He is a genius, a poet.  I loved this film, because not only did it tell me of the interesting life of his father, but also because of the insight into the life of Gonzaguinha.  To an American, this is a somewhat interesting story, but to a Brazilian or a person heavily familiar with Brazilian culture, this film is a must-see.",1384473600,,386,4.5
