1027255,4,6305428298,"I thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a film. The story is simple and not a little metaphorical. The finding of one's own voice is something that many of us can relate to. Unfortunately though, I was left with the jarring,  discordant memories of Michael Caine's character and LV's mother  dominanting my impression, at the expense of some of the more exquisitly  delicate aspects of the story. Ewan McGregor's Billy was brilliantly  underplayed and the perfect foil for Jane Horrock's LV. I replayed all of  their scenes to balance the lingering discord, and that worked relatively  well. I think if the director and the editor had been more judicious in  their decisions about the length of time that overwhelming characters were  on screen the film would have been a masterpiece.",931737600,2,777,4.9689922480620154
1027256,5,6305428298,"Not just a ""movie version"" of a stage play, Little Voice is really a MOVIE. It uses the language of film to enhance the already brilliant telling of the story. I happen to be a huge fan of Brassed Off,  Full Monty and lots of other ""brit-flicks"", and this is as good  as any of 'em. Horrocks is tremendous - Ewan M. gives a sensitive  performance as the 'love interest', and Michael Caine is over-the-top  brilliant. I don't see it as a depressing movie at all! It seemed  hopefully, happy and sweet. Maybe some of the other reviewers only want  ""american"" style movies - guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy  shoots a bunch of guns, and guy gets girl - but those of us who still think  Shakespeare is something more than a fishing reel are continually on the  lookout for gems like this!",930355200,,787,4.372413793103449

Of course the rest of the cast was stunning as well...Brenda  Blethyn was much more deserving of the academy award than Judi Dench.  She  really made me hate her and her loud mouth, uncaring ways, yet in the end  she got my sympathy, something I'm never willing to give out.  And Michale  Caine's own performance as he sings of his washed up carreer is worth  seeing.  The script is funny at times and devastating at others, and it  isn't the happiest of stories, but it has more spirit than can usually be  captured on film.",926553600,2,678,4.4227642276422765

1027387,5,6305428298,"How can I convice you to watch this mervelous movie?
It was a magical film for me and I was enchanted for this film and had to position this one for my top 10 musical (Not exactly a musical though).

Ewan Mcgregor, Michael Caine are all just so lovely but most of al, most of all the main charactor Jane Horrocks was an angel.

Jane was a total recluse and lives with her mother.
She is so so shy that whenever someone visits she even dashes to her room hides. She never even speaks.
She is like 30 after all.
One thing she does is she constantly listens to old songs like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Bassey.
The mother has a boyfrind (Michael Caine) who works for music business and one day when Jane was listening to the music, the ligh goes out and didn't know that, she sang out loud.
Accidentally listens to her singing, the boyfriend hears her song and was totally knocked down by her voice, her technique.
She was a natural born diva.
The only problem was she was so shy that it was almost impossible for them to make her sing in public.
Now can they be able to make her sing in public?

When they are about to give up and go out, she sings again because she saw her dead father and she wanted to sing for him.
They hear her singing outside and again they were totally freezed.
They wanted to earn money out of her.
Now there is another man Ewan Mcgregor who is the only guy who truely cares about Jane Horrocks.
He couldn't do anything so he just looks at her from far away.

The day she sings in the big bar, the father was with her the whole time.
She sang, she perform like a true diva, the true star.
Everyone were crazy about her.
The mother and Michael Caine were almost crazy from the reaction of the audiences.
But Jane Horrocks talks to herself, this was the only once that she sang in public and it was for her father.

The day they wanted to make her sing again, there was a fire on the house and all she wanted was to bring all her records out from the fire.
No one helped her but  Ewan Mcgregor. He was like a knight with a white horse.
She finally saw the sun. She is not a recluse anymore.",1466553600,,2125,4.145631067961165

It was his record collection and her connection to him. Trashy mother's sleazy nightclub talent finder boyfriend tries to get her to sing at his nightclub to make him rich.

The movie seemed unrealistic to me. I just couldn't buy it. Maybe it is because I know the actress from her ""Absolutely Fabulous"" characters where she is not meek let alone mild. Or it just could be bad acting. The lead actress over did her part. That woman is so in love with acting that she just turns the volume up so loud that you just want to shut her out sometimes. And this was one of those times. She would say stuff just to be saying it. Too much. And sometimes I couldn't understand what she was saying with that thick accent. There was no chemistry built between the McGregor character and ""Little Voice"" at all. But there was supposed to be this two awkward people find love theme there. There was the opportunity but it fell flat. This movie was supposed to be about overcoming your horrible situation through realizing your potential. Success. But it didn't do that either especially with the anticlimactic ending. It was just a bumbling mess by the end. Just a huge let down. Disappointing. No one wants to cheer for someone to make it and then . . . nothing. But of course there was the ick factor too. It was supposed to be another one of those ""different is good"" . . . the freaks are likeable movies too. But they just couldn't get me to like these.

1027525,1,6305428298,"This is not only a terribly crafted movie but one full of embarrassing performances. I'm guessing Michael Caine wasn't getting any more lead roles in films so he grabbed this one.

Specifically, everyone was annoying, the scenery dark and dank, the clothing white trash and the plot unfulfilled. From what I've read the lead actress is a very strange person in real life and did not stray too much from associating it with her character. About the only good part of the movie was the ten to fifteen minutes when she finally comes alive, shows a persona on stage and entertains gloriously.  The rest of the time you just want to slap her out of her comatose state.

I also understand this was a stage play. If so, some stories are just not meant to be filmed unless doctored significantly. It's not even worth going over the ""who cares?"" plot.

If I could give this zero stars I would feel better. Please don't waste your time.",1422921600,,926,4.5602409638554215

But as a singer myself I have to say the actress Jane in this movie is unbelievable tops!!! I still can't wrap my head around the fact that she actually sang all the song herself and her ability to mimic so many voices is nothing short of incredible!!! All the actors were great in this. It is British. I would say that Ewan McGregor was good but really was not the major actor.

It takes a dramatic turn near the end which shocked and surprised me so all in all I would give it a 5 star rating.  This movie gets very dramatic and an unbelievable performance by Micael Cain!! The singing  performance in this movie is a real show stopper and very exciting. Why have I not heard of this actress/singer she is a super star!!

1027598,3,6305428298,"Though preferring to give this a higher score, as the group of actors were EXCELLENT, the filming good, Little Voice's performance very very
enjoyable, even amaIng , the story as drawn here, was not supportive of the rhythm of the tale,creating a too soon denouement and poor, dissatisfying ending.  It begins interestingly and invitingly.  Brenda Blethyn, plays a flirty, sexy, very mouthy mom who is ""getting connected up"" to the new fangled telephone!  Her accent is very thick regional (which I cannot tell), but she keeps talking so you get enough.  She flirts
constantly with the telephone installer ( played Inspector X to Poirot) and his helper (Euan MacGregor), the latter of whom is very shy and in a passion about pigeons.  While there,  Elvie, Little Voice, comes shly downstairs to get a snack, eyeing Euan - they eyed each other - and the mom shouts some disrespect so Elvie scurries back upstairs, instantly soothing herself with some wonderful female vocalist on her 33 1/3 record player - maybe Judy Garland.  The mom comments to the two guys"" this is how she calms herself"" and the stage is set.  Euan humorously tries to contrive a meeting, but, she ""doesn't go out.""  Life, however, comes to her.  The mom and her worker friend, go out for
some dance and drinks, meeting Michael Caine, an impresario, who, taken home for some roustabout sex,  happens to overhear Elvie at night, singing in the dark.  She is remarkable, because she can imitate ALL these female vocalists in bits from famous  songs!!!  That is worth hearing, even if she doesn't look the part at that moment.  Caine, alert, kind, very patient and caring, bit by bit convinces her to give a performance.  This part of the story is the build up.  And despite the mom's outright physical and psychological violence and jealously, and the girl's own fears, she actually manages to make it, with a lot of support and coaxing. You feel happy, satisfied, love hearing her voices, so glad FOR her, and in a glow of success.  She IS her beloved Daddy's girl!  (He was ""there"" in spirit to encourage and love her.)  But then, the story drops into the bottom; everything goes wrong, she can't show up again, and that's that.  For me this was a gut wrenching ending.  The only good that seems to have come out of it is that she faced her mother, telling her exactly what harm she did to her husband and daughter, and how Elvie felt and thought about it.  It was a real dog fight, but a relief.  The last scene is Elvie with Euan at the peaceful pigeon coops, where it looked like they had achieved mutual comfort and acceptance, certainly no bad thing, but for me, a hapless, empty ending.",1409184000,3,2663,4.665236051502146

Jane Horrocks who plays the central character, LV is understated in her performance but it's the understatement that is truly brilliant. Her performance as an actress is truly spot on perfect and just brilllant. if that weren't enough she performs all the standard songs she sings her self, and I must say- perfectly. She does Judy Garland, Billy Holiday, and Marylin Monroe so well that it is truly a wonder to behold. This is a gifted actress with multiple talents, She is truly astonishing. One of those rare people that can act and can sing like no one else on earth. But the glory of this film doesn't stop there. LV's mother played by Brenda Blethyn is simply fantastic. And though her character is pretty despicable and a real nasty person, she steals the show in nearly every scene she's in. Out doing even the genious of her onscreen co-star Michael Caine, who is as always just brilliant. The film is not particularly a comedy, nor is it really a drama. It's one of those films that is very difficult to categorize, but it's downright a magical experience in the most unlikely manner.

1027686,4,6305428298,"Little Voice is truly a charming fantasy that spins the tale about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music can lead to an amazing transformation. Laura, nicknamed LV for Little Voice, is the tale of a reclusive young woman who lives in the shadow of her spiteful, shrew-like mother. LV can really only communicate by mimicking performances by torch singers such as Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Bassey. LV is played by Jane Horrocks, who starred in the British cult sit-com ""Absolutely Fabulous"". Her mother is played by Brenda Blethyn, who received a very well deserved Academy Award Nomination as Best Supporting Actress. LV spends hours alone in her room playing old records, which she inherited from her beloved late father who shared a fondness for these famous singers. Michael Caine, who received a Best Actor Golden Globe Award for his performance as a sleazy talent agent, discovers the secret of LV's voice and smells money. He hooks up with an equally sleazy nightclub owner played by Jim Broadbent who plans to exploit LV's special talent. Ewan Mcgregor plays a local telephone repair man who also raises pigeons, is really the only character in the movie who seems to honestly care about LV, and tries to communicate with her as much as possible. Horrocks does all of the singing herself and it is truly uncanny the way that she can sound just like her idols. The movie is a vivid adaptation of Jim Cartwright's London play ""The Rise And Fall Of Little Voice"". All five characters are excellent! It comes off as an odd British fantasy which plays achingly melancholic at times. Overall, however, I found the film totally uplifting! The running time of the film is 97 minutes with not even one minute wasted. It is in Widescreen format and the transfer is excellent! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!",1361836800,3,1833,4.859424920127796

But it is the comedy act of Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn that makes this a stand out. Mr Caine as a seedy, still trying to break a start music agent, and playing catch up in a changing world (even in the north) of music's road to stardom via the working mens' clubs. But he drives the car. Brenda Blethyn is a wired up fish wife with a heart bigger than Grimsby (small English fishing fleet town) and a letdown in life the equivalent of being sent to live out the rest of your days (many and long) in Peterborough (another English town but without a fishing fleet and a population who speaks with a nasaly twang). The weakness, other than a soppy Ewan McGregor was Ms Horrocks' voice. Ok, she can sing but then so can I in the bath, but would I want to put it on celluloid.

1027691,2,6305428298,"`Little Voice' opens with a lot of noise, most of that coming out of Brenda Blethyn's mouth.  As the foul mouthed, self-centered, promiscuous mother to the film's primary protagonist, Blethyn practices the `more is more' philosophy and she drenches every scene with her fast-talking verbal drool.  She's like the British variation of Melissa Leo's Oscar winning mommy-dearest in `The Fighter'; always having something to say regardless of the fact that you wish she'd just shut up.

But enough about Blethyn.

`Little Voice' tells the story of a young reclusive girl named LV (short for Little Voice).  Her mother is oppressive and seems to have little regard for her daughter and her dreamy fantasies about famous lounge singers and the like.  Instead, LV is left to suffer in silence as her mother shakes her tail all over town and harbors her own dreams of shacking up with Ray Say, a local talent manager who books shows for a theater of questionable taste.  When Ray hears LV's big gift (she can almost expertly imitate the vocal stylings of famed singers like Garland and Monroe) he is starstruck.  He sees gold in his eyes and does everything in his power to get LV to make his dreams come true.

At the heart of `Little Voice' is a story of lost individuals trying to find happiness amidst other people who constantly drag them down.  LV is the obvious heroine mostly because her mother is the chief antagonist and her shelter existence is the film's core obstacle to overcome.  Sadly, not much about `Little Voice' feels genuine.  It just kind of lays there.  We know that LV is haunted by her past, mostly which involving her late father and the relationship that he had with her feisty mother, but it doesn't really feel heartfelt.  It feels gimmicky.  The film also doesn't have the right balance between the dramatics and the comedic, for it breezes through scenes that should have felt deeper panned.

Blethyn received an Oscar nomination for her crazed portrayal of LV's mother, Mari.  She does a fine job.  It's a spastic and attention grabbing performance, and it was designed that way.  I can't say she was anything special because there seemed to be a shallow depth there, which is mostly the scripts fault but it could have been mined by Blethyn a little better.  Jane Horrocks is meekish and reclusive, like her character, but it is a fault to the film because she disappears.  One writes her off and doesn't care much for following her character's arc.  She needed to add some spark or at least some layer of emotional relevance to get her character to register and she doesn't do that.  Ewan, and actor who I generally adore, is horrible here.

And then there is Michael Caine.  When people think of this movie, if they aren't thinking about Caine then they obviously haven't watched this movie yet.  His delivery of `It's Over' is not only the finest scene in the film but possible the most memorable and emotionally impacted scene in the year of film that was 1998.  It is a searing performance, one that comes full circle in a way that feels complete, authentic and appropriate.

His lack of Oscar attention was disgusting.

At the end of the day, `Little Voice' lacks the voice to pull off such a story.  It really needed deeper impact, especially from LV herself, but the film is basically left in Michael Caine's hands, and while he delivers a staggering performance, this is not his story and he can only do so much.",1337904000,,3446,4.723618090452261

The story of an introverted girl who mimics famous vocalists and her boozy loud and obnoxious Mom is incredibly well written and the actors in the film version are all terrific. This is a sad tale of desperation and family strife with some elements of dark comedy provided by Caine and the small time show biz type he represents.

1027773,3,6305428298,"I actually enjoyed the film when I watched it; it was only after reading some of the more critical reviews here that I started to think about it and realize that it didn't entirely work for me.
(Maybe the moral is not to think about films too much, if you just want to enjoy them.)

I think that problem with the film is that it was conceived as a showcase for Jane Horrock's vocal impersonations.  A stage show was built around them, with a story that, according to people who saw it, was much deeper in character development.  Apparently the film's version cut out much of the mother's character, which would make the film more meaningful and believable.

Besides that,I think that the main problem I had with the film was that I didn't much care for the much lauded performance. I did laugh out loud at her ""Marlene Dietrich"" but her ""Judy Garland"" was sort of creepy and her ""Marilyn Monroe"" was pathetic.

So this whole story was constructed around this performance and, at the end of it I had to say ""Much to do about Nothing.""

We find out, at the end, that ""Little Voice's"" real name is ""Laura,"" hence my reference to ""Laura Wingfield"", another pathologically shy heroine with an overbearing cruel mother, in ""The Glass Menagerie.""  Tennesse Williams did it much better!  Laurence Olivier did a star turn as ""Archie"" someone, another down-on-his luck British entertainer, in the film, ""The Entertainer.""
Here Michael Caine gives another terrific performance of the same kind of guy.  He almost makes the film worth seeing.

The character of Little Voice is not very believable.  She goes from practically catatonic, rarely speaks, never leaves the house, doesn't make eye contact, etc. to a vibrant happy person helping her new love train his pigeons.  It's a nice thought but really strains credibility.

However, if you just want a feel good film that doesn't make you think too much, this may be just the thing.",1258329600,3,1922,4.753012048192771

The first is obvious. Jane Horrock's singing was a wonder to behold.

The second is Michael Caine's performance. He has been a favorite of mine for a long time (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfie/dp/B000055ZF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfie</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ipcress-File/dp/B001DOM03C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ipcress File</a>) and I am still amazed by his abilities.

In Little Voice he once again does a fine job, but the highlight for me was his rendition of Roy Orbison's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Over/dp/B00005A1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Over</a>"". Although from a technical perspective not  as skillful as Horrock's singing it was equally, or more, effective in expressing his character's emotions. It was this performance that prompted me to go to the trouble of writing this review.

In a review of The Man Who Would Be King, someone said of Caine (and also of Sean Connery) ""movie stars who are also great actors -- of which there ain't many."" (And then there is George Hamilton who, when asked how it felt to be a famous actor, replied in a huff ""I'm not an actor -- I'm a movie star!"" But I digress.)

Michael Caine trivia: A quote from IMDB: ""First of all, I choose the great roles, and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don't come, I choose the ones that pay the rent."" I had a glimpse of this in 1978 on the Johnny Carson show. Caine was on to push his latest movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swarm/dp/B000067FP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swarm</a>&nbsp;(a lousy 3.8 on IMDB's ""User Rating""). When Carson threw Caine a softball question to allow him to start hyping the movie, Caine's response was that no one should bother seeing it; it was a terrible movie and he only did it because he needed the money for a down payment on a house. (I always wondered what Warner Brothers reaction was to this.) Maybe that honesty helps make him a great actor suitable for the great roles.

Jane Horrocks, who played numerous characters in the cult English sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"", shines here as a sorrowfully shy girl with a talent beyond belief.

After her father died, many years ago, she resigned herself to listening to his old records, and singing along with them. She soon became a virtuoso, capable of imitating Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and others. In equally brilliant performances, Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn (Pride and Prejudice) the former wants to bring LV's talent to the world, certain that great riches are but a step away. Brenda (LV's mom) is at first completely oblivious to her daughters talent, as she is far too egocentric to notice anything or anyone but herself - unless it's a man. In that case, she's quite the player.

There is a somewhat interesting - although perhaps unnecessary - love interest between LV and Billy (Ewan McGregor). It seems to serve as helping LV to open up to the world, but there are so many things/occurrences that can happen to a person that incite change that I'm a little fed up with movies taking the easy way out with a love interest. AND, there was such an occurrence in the film itself. Still, Ewan plays his part well, and while his interest in LV is a bit difficult to understand, it's not entirely unbelievable.

What IS unbelievable is Jane Horrocks's amazing voice. You'd think that the filmmakers would have her lip synch while either a recording of Judy Garland, or someone who could imitate her, was singing. But they didn't need to do so. Horrocks did so herself. She imitated all of the artist's brilliantly, and nearly perfectly.

It was easy to see, after this performance, what a remarkably gifted actress she is. The characters she played on ""AbFab"" were hysterical and widely variant, though she is best known as the mentally challenged Bubble.",1168300800,11,1872,4.855799373040752

Jane Horrocks is a wonder as ""Little Voice"", the girl who barely whispers, but who comes alive belting out tunes made famous by Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey and others.

Jane was nominated for 5 awards, including the Golden Globe and BAFTA for her flawless performance in ""Little Voice"" and as a result was given her own UK tv series called ""Never Mind The Horrocks"".  Hopefully, she will take many more film roles that will showcase her many talents, and possibly record an album of songs for her fans.

She also comes very close to someone with high functioning autism or Asperger's without ever labouring the point of disability or labels in any way.  That's whats so marvellous about this film, its story, its writing, its direction, its acting... seriously, can't praise this one highly enough.

So great, in fact that Michael was nominated for an Oscar for his performance of the producer/womanizer/lothario Mr. Ray Say. After Ray hears L.V. singing in her upstairs bedroom he knows he has found a star and pawns everything he owns to make money and exploit L.V.'s singing talent.

1027906,3,6305428298,"Jane Horrocks is a British comedian who amongst her many talents is a great mimic of female vocal artists. This film was originally a stage play based around her.
The plot of the film is simple. Jane plays Little Voice a young woman who lacks self confidence and whose life has been destroyed by an overbearing and grotesque mother. The mother continually belittles her daughter who is so lacking in any social sills that she sits in her room each night playing old 50's and 60's records owned by her father. It would seem that the father was also destroyed by the mother. She sings along to these records and is able to mimic such greats as Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and Marilyn Munro. (Okay Marilyn Munro was not a great but you know what I mean)
Michael Caine plays a seedy music entrepreneur who is limping along in obscurity heading career wise somewhere worse than obscurity. He has a brief drunken fling with Little Voice's mother and hears her voice coming from her room. He immediately sees her as an unexploited talent that might just bring him back into the game.
The film centres on a concert organised by Caine and its aftermath. Broadly the film is a morality tale in which the mother and Caine get what is coming to them and Little Voice is able to achieve something more than fame and that is normality.
The film is both good and bad. Horrocks at its centre is brilliant and it is her talent that is responsible for everything good about it. Her performance scenes are breathtaking made more remarkable by the use of her own voice. It is the other characters and the rest of the film that is the drag. The morality tale is rather telescoped and the character of the mother a repellent and grotesque rather than being real. The end a little bit of an anti-climax. One would imagine that this stems from the difficulty of converting the play to a film.
Never the less the performance of Horrocks is so strong and the premise so clever that the film is worth looking at despite its faults.",1082419200,5,2005,4.526170798898072
1027907,4,6305428298,"The most remarkable aspect of this movie is the great performance of all main actors: Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine,  each one of them as impressive as possible and it is hard to say whose act is the best; is it the surprising wonderfully voiced Jane Horrocks, who makes this movie such a satisfying entertainment, Michael Caine who plays all nuances of the greedy agent (one who knows how to psychologically manipulate mother and daughter) or the great Brenda Blethyn whose every twist of face and body is an act of its own. Mari talks all the time, but in the few instances when she has no words - Brenda Blethyn's face says it all. I am not sure that Mari deserves all that she gets in this movie, but she is punished for all her doings in the unforgettable words she hears from both agent and daughter.
Throughout the movie I was expecting some sort of reconciliation between mother and daughter or some recognition from mother towards daughter, some kind words... appreciation...but none of this is here and there is no attempt to cover the real-life truth. This is even sharpened when one understands that yes, the mother is jealous of her daughter and no, the daughter is not just ""naturally shy"". All falls to place at the movie's climax moment and all is understood.
Although Mari's character is unpleasant, she is so wonderfully portrayed by Brenda Blethyn that I was unable to feel any contempt for her character because above all she is a human being to whom you feel a mixture of both anger and pity.
The second aspect of Little Voice is the music - Jane Horrocks honors the great singers (Shirley Bassey, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland) with her performance that tries to bring them as they were and not to glorify herself. This is quite a contradictory statement as the film was built around Jane Horrocks unique talent - but this is only ""behind the scenes"" knowledge and not what you feel when you see her on screen. Not a ""big"" movie and does not intend to be one. The splendid perfomrance makes it worth your time.",1055116800,9,2052,4.6219178082191785
1027908,5,6305428298,"Astounding performances lift this movie and make it soar!  Michael Caine portrays perhaps the most vile character of his career with a range of nuance and expression that would challenge even the most adept actors.  It might well be his best work ever!  But his sleazy Ray Say would be just another manipulative has-been were it not for the work of Jane Horrocks' Little Voice.  Ms. Horrocks doesn't just recreate the voices of Judy Garland, Marlilyn Monroe and numerous other singers, she practically channels them in one of the most unique performances I've ever seen.
Little Voice or LV for short is a severely withdrawn young woman whose response to an earlier trauma has rendered her mute but for an ability to sing in the voice of past stars.  Her mother, Brenda Blethyn, is accepting of this until linking up with Caine's struggling agent, Ray.  The two seek to exploit LV, albeit for differing reasons; Mom wants her to succeed at something, while Ray sees nothing but profit in a client with more potential than his current stable of strippers and hack comics.
Ewan McGregor appears as an equally shy telephone repair man, with Jim Broadbent as a club owner that is every bit as low brow as his clientele.  Beyond the marvelous characterizations, the film's setting in a northern England city makes for a setting of pathos and futility that has you rooting for LV to escape not only her emotional prison but the physical one of her family and environment.  Horrocks will have your heart within the first five minutes and she never lets go.",1054512000,4,1548,4.771535580524344

It brought back happy memories of cars dividing in two, and boys who talk non-stop to their girlfriends about boring technical stuff.
But the highlight of the film is the terrific vocal impersonations of great singers by Jane Horrocks.
I thought the plot was well thought out and ended in a most satisfying way. A great DVD to watch several times, I think.
If, like me, you are one of those people who think that characters can be shown to be rough without them having to be given copious amounts of gutter language to use, then be warned there is a lot of this stuff in the film, but other than that, it is terrific.

LV's mother is a loud, middle-aged floozy who wears pushup bras, micromini skirts, towering heels & lace tightsn and prattles on nonstop in a barely decipherable accent and odd syntax (I kept the subtitles on during the entire film -- a big help.)  Her best friend Sadie is a chubby, funny-faced follower who never speaks -- the mother babbles nonstop & no one else has a chance to get a word in edgewise.  LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.  The plot keeps you on edge, but all is resolved positively in the end.  As an added bonus, Jane Horrocks (LV) is, in fact, an incredible performer, able to mimic everyone from Judy Garland in Wizard Oz to Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday.""",1049932800,3,1110,4.8465608465608465

1027914,4,6305428298,"""Little Voice"" is a strange little film.  It is based on the play ""The Rise and Fall of Little Voice"" which was written by Jim Cartwright specifically and most deservedly for the talented voice of actress Jane Horrocks.  However, given what I have seen in this movie there must be some significant changes with the last act of the story from what appeared on stage.  The story basically falls into three stages, which can aptly be described as the discovery, rise, and fall of Little Voice.  This is the nickname of LV (Horrocks), the painfully shy daughter of human hurricane Mari (Brenda Blethyn), who takes refuge in her room upstairs listening to her father's record albums.  On the few occasions when she actually utters words it is indeed in the littlest of voices and we are genuinely surprised when she actually makes eye contact with another human being.  Trying to do more than that is young Billy (Ewan McGregor), who is smitten with the shy young woman.  Meanwhile, Ray Say (Michael Caine), a seedy third-rate manager of fourth rate talent in the entertainment biz blows into town to have some good times with Mari and he proves to be more than her equal in terms of having a very good time.
Then, in one of those scenes that delightfully catches us by surprise, both Ray and the audience learn that LV might not talk, but she can sing.  More to the point, she can sing like the singers on the records she listens to, which means we are talking Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey, Billie Holiday, and other music icons.  Ray has dollar signs in his eyes that blind him to the obvious amorous affections of Mari as the big question becomes how to get the timid LV upon on the stage at the club of Mr. Boo (Jim Broadhurst).
The rise part of the story is the most enjoyable as our anticipation builds for the moment when LV is going to let loose with all those voices she keeps bottled up inside.  Of course, once that happens there is nowhere to go but down.  Ray coaxes LV into the big moment through dishonest means, which is a portent of what is to come.  Caine's performance is marvelous from start until the final act of this film, at which point his character throws away all of the good grace he has developed over the course of the film.  Our sympathy is totally with LV, who is always singing in her mind's eye to her long departed father (special mention to Graham Turner for the perfectly wonderful smile on his face), although young Billy's earnestness wins our admiration as well.  By the end of the film LV's career and a whole lot of other things are in ashes.  The ending of ""Little Voice"" is rather unsatisfying, but to paraphrase the Bard, I am not sure what satisfaction it could provide us from where it begins.
Blethyn got a supporting actress nomination for her performance in this film and Caine's performance is what of his better efforts, but the reason to watch this film is Horrocks.  In the end your biggest complaint with this film is going to be that Horrocks does not do a lot more singing.  I understand the importance of the key line that LV finally gets to delivery to her mother, but I cannot help but feel that there should have been an equally important moment from the musical perspective.  ""Little Voice"" is worth the watching, but if you find yourself only rewatching the middle section, do not be tremendously surprised.",1043366400,3,3365,4.561461794019934

I loved the plot and felt so sorry for LV, while at the same sympathising with Mari and Ray...and the ending was so tension-filled I was bouncing up and down screaming at the TV.  Normally I find Horrocks rather annoying but she, like the rest of the cast, was brilliant in this and I was most impressed by her singing.  The only thing is that I felt the film ended a bit abruptly.  Like you never found out how LV sorted things out with her mother.  It was a good ending but it just had some blanks to it.

Ms. Horrocks delivers one of the best performances I've seen, full-stop -- not only for her spot-on impressions, but for the nuances of her characterization throughout the film.  It's hard to say, at the end, if Elvie should be on the path to fame, should be simply left alone, or should be institutionalized...
Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine give great performances as wonderfully over-the-top, if at times a bit disturbing, individuals, and Ewan MacGregor deftly handles his role in the most internalized and understated performance I've seen from him.

1027996,5,6305428298,"I've been reading these wonderful reviews and noticing that many of them question why this movie wasn't recognized by the Academy Awards. Of course, it should have been. But I think it started when the film wasn't nominated for the Golden Globe. While it's true that three of the major cast members were nominated and Michael Caine deservedly won for Best Actor, the Hollywood Foreign Press neglected to nominate the film. Which is strange because it would've been under the category of ""Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical""...and I can think of no other movie in recent memory that fits that category so perfectly, as it is both musical and funny. ""Little Voice"" was certainly more worthy than the critically-panned Robin Williams medical comedy, ""Patch Adams"", which was nominated!
Anyway, that year ""Shakespeare In Love"" was taking all the awards. There's no way that Gweneth Paltrow gave a better performance in a comedy/musical than Jane Horrocks, but Paltrow and her movie had more power and influence that year. Both films were distributed by MIRAMAX who apparently decided they'd have a better shot at winning awards if they concentrated more effort promoting ""Shakespeare In Love"" rather than the smaller, lesser seen ""Little Voice""...which led to so few nominations come Oscar-time. I found it ironic that Brenda Blethyn was the only acting nomination for the Academy Award since her performance was the weakest, in my opinion. But at least it was a nomination. There was no excuse for Mr. Caine to be ignored. I read somewhere that the academy would've had no problem nominating Caine for SUPPORTING actor rather than lead. But (a) his role is definately a LEAD role, and (b) this is the same Academy that nominated Hollywood-favorite Dustin Hoffman for lead actor in ""Wag The Dog"" in what was basically a supporting role.
Either way, the movie got screwed. But at least some of us recognize this film's brilliance and originality. I like it when movies surprise me and show me something different. ""Little Voice"" does that and so much more.",1032825600,3,2056,4.997084548104956

One such act is Jane Horrocks's Little Voice, a quiet girl who comes to life only when she is singing. The actress's talent and extensive training leave you with the impression that she is a singer who just happens to act rather than the other way round. If Brenda Blethyn's part wasn't offered to Julie Walters first, I will eat my hat! She is stereotyped ageing northern tart, played with great pathos as well as comedy by Blethyn. Jim Broadbent is suitably seedy as club owner Mr Boo, while Ewan McGregor has a surprisingly small role as a telephone technician who has only peripheral involvement with Little Voice until the last scene. The script is full of good characterisation and wry social comment. I liked it because it tells an original story in an entertaining way.

Brenda Blethyn is hilarious, and it's not just because the script-writer is excellent: a motor-mouth with a razor wit and heartful of disappointment just below the surface; a comic in  the great tradition of Julie Walters. I wished Ewan McGregor had a  bigger part, but then he's the silent counterpart to Little Voice. My only criticism is that the last part of the movie is a little too conceptual: we're obviously meant to feel that Little Voice has gained a great freedom (all the references to Judy Garland, bluebirds, etc), but I didn't feel that I had actually SEEN that. Little Voice's  attachment to her father is almost disturbing, and although it's meant to be a happy, feel-good ending, I couldn't help feeling anxious for Ewan McGregor's character - will he ever be able to make up for her missing, saintly Dad?

1028065,5,6305428298,"Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan McGregor, and Jane Horrocks give absolutely stellar performances in this wonderfully quirky film. The title of the film refers to Jane Horrocks' character who is called ""Little Voice"" or LV, for short.

LV is a mousy, meek, painfully shy and reclusive little thing with an itty bitty speaking voice. She is totally overwhelmed by her brazen and common mother, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), who treats LV with scarcely concealed contempt. Part of that contempt is fueled by LV's devotion to her late father's memory and her fondness for old time musical stars. She has a collection of records by those long ago stars, that she plays over and over, a collection that she apparently inherited from her beloved father.

Her passion for this music drives her mother crazy, as it seems to remind Mari of her late husband, whom she apparently held in the same regard in which she holds LV. Only Billy (Ewan MCGregor), the local telephone repairman, a sensitive, young man who trains and raises pigeons as a hobby, seems to talk to LV as if she were a sentient being.

Mari begins dating Ray Say (Michael Caine), an over the hill, has been talent scout. Mari is pathetic, as she tries desperately to hang on to whatever vestiges of her youth remain. Ray, a sleazy opportunist, who thinks that he is God's gift to women, does not exactly reciprocate Mari's lavish affections. I cannot, however, think of two people who deserve each other more.

One day, LV is in her room singing, and Ray overhears her, but what he hears is ""Judy Garland"". It seems that LV can sing and sound exactly like those old time musical stars. Ray is in seventh heaven with his discovery. You can almost see the dollar signs in his eyes. He will do whatever it takes to get LV on stage, though his unctiousness towards her only serves to fuel Mari's jealousy of Ray's attention to her daughter.

Ultimately, Mari and Ray band together, however, as LV is their meal ticket to fame and fortune, if they can only get her to overcome her shyness and reclusiveness. They do not, however, understand why she sings. It is this lack of perception that that will, in the end, be their undoing.

Nonetheless, LV goes on to give one of the most show stopping performances ever to grace center stage. The transformation is incredible. Jane Horrocks gives a performance to be remembered! The only question is whether Ray and Mari can get LV to sing more than once. See the movie and find out for yourself.

The stunning thing is that the film could have been about ME in that department. I have always listened 2 Judy Garland - especially when the World has been against me. And by God that voice has helped me. Enough of the similarieties... When Laura gives the all-stops performance, it is a creative outlet and the LP`s doesn`t mean that much anymore. As Billy explains; there are people ALIVE who fancies (read: him) LV. Cause in a a way: Judy, Shirley and Marilyn represents LV`s Dad and she can`t allow herself 2 be rid of him. 2gether with Billy, she opens one of the pigeons cages and set them free - a metaphore really - LAURA  IS  FREE(she frees herself  from her mental and motherly blocks) The music selections are fine and personally I fully enjoy the tribute 2 Judy(though Jane is not up 2 Judy`s level singing the legend`s songs. The music is nicely arranged though). The DVD offers a ""making of"" and as said, Brenda Blethyn is the standout(compare the fiction personality and Brenda`s own).

The virtually unknown (to American filmgoing audiences) Jane Horrocks (she plays the character in live theatre as well) is brilliant as the silent, shy, and introverted Little Voice. She never talks (and is even too afraid to answer the telephone), but sometimes, as if possessed by the souls of larger-than-life stars like Judy Garland, Little Voice is able to sing and imitate these stars. Her nagging and ungrateful mother, played by a talented but always appropriately annoying Brenda Blethyn, is jealous of Little Voice, treats her horribly, and resents the relationship LV (as she is referred to) shared with her father. Michael Caine is excellent as Blethyn's sleazy date who comes home with her and ""discovers"" this goldmine that is LV's voice and talent. Blethyn grows more and more jealous of Caine's interest in her daughter. Caine convinces LV to perform live (which will, presumably, make her-and him-rich). Caine uses LV's dead father as a ploy to get her onstage, and for one night, she discards her shyness and her fears and gives the performance of a lifetime. Caine sees the profit growing in his imagination and books many more occasions for LV to sing, but she refuses to perform ever again. Blethyn's character grows more and more bitter. Eventually their house burns down, and LV leaves to be with a shy telephone repairman and pigeon-keeper played well by Ewan McGregor who has quietly been pursuing LV all along. The film is delightful for its offbeat charm, although it is a somewhat sad tale for Blethyn and Caine's characters.

Imagine my disappointment and,  well...confusion!  Alison Steadman took the lead as Little Voice's mother  in the stage play, and gave what I believe to be a 'landmark' performance.  And the performance was so brilliant thanks to the ROLE being so complex;  throughout, the character of L.V's mother is absolutely TORTURED, swinging  from vile, obnoxious and over-bearing to vulnerable and pathetic.  At the  end of the stage play, we finally learn WHY she is so over-bearing and  aggressive; it is because her husband, Little Voice's dead father, was so  WEAK and INEFFECTUAL that she, the mother, had to take on the  responsibility for the whole family in a town which laughed at her husband  for his obsession with Judy Garland and the likes.  Your heart absolutely  BREAKS for her, and the whole 'idea' behind 'Little Voice' as a play about  two women struggling with their own psychosis caused by a dead man falls  into place and absolutely knocks you over!  Boy, did they 'dumb it down'  for the movie version!  The entire 'point' to the original story is  'missing'; the mother, played by Brenda Blethyn, is nothing more than an  over-played charicature of an obnoxious woman (so what! ) and I am tempted  to think that this is the fault of bad direction; Brenda Blethyn is a  marvellous character actress, and I was frankly surprised to see her giving  such an over-acted and one-dimensional performance.  The moving monologue  at the end of the stage play where the mother EXPLAINS why she has become  such an ogre has been totally cut from the movie, and so the 'resolution'  you're waiting for throughout the film never, ever happens. Jane Horrock  played 'Little Voice' on the West End as well as in the film version, and  although fine in the film, she was 'better' on the stage because their was  more 'meat' for her to grapple with in terms of her character's psychology.  In the film version, we're never quite sure what her 'problem' is, and  quite frankly, her 'silent psychosis' gets a little irritating! Michael  Caine's character of 'Ray Say' did not exist in the stage play (although I  believed he was referred to) and I was glad it was included in the film, as  he at LEAST was a three-dimensional character one could 'believe' in. So  what are we left with? The story of a girl who doesn't speak but can do  GREAT imitations of legendary singers who eventually breaks free of her  over-bearing mother to take up life with a telephone repair man.  There is  nothing MORE to the movie than THIS, and if their IS a deeper subtext, it  doesn't come through at all. The 'mistake' that was made in adapting this  play for the screen was in making it 'L.V's' story; on the stage, it was  her MOTHER'S story.

So fearful and introverted is the gentle creature that she rarely ventures out of her house and into the world  outside.  Instead, she counts on the voices of such enchantresses as Judy  Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Bassey as a sounding board for the  pain she suffers form having lost her father.  Living in the sleepy seaside  town of Scarborough, England with a repressive, pseudo-socialite mother,  Little Voice's grandest ability is to communicate by using her melodic and  unparalleled gift for singing, and finds refuge within her music as well as  her father's ever-present spirit.
 The day comes when a sleazy tavern act  promoter, a role that is splendidly delivered by one of England's foremost  actors, Michael Caine, suddenly discovers LV.  In an act of fervent  courage, Little Voice comes out of her shell and sweeps an audience off  their feet with her incredible stage presence, and her even more surprising  knack for flawlessly emulating the voices of her favorite sirens.
Nevertheless, this film has an even more profound agenda.  Not only is  LV finally vanquishing her constrained sense of self, but also she has  finally begun to trust the another person other than her father's ghost, a  local boy who likes to look after his pigeons.  Ewan McGregor fills the  shoes of the small role, but he is one of the characters who has a more  profound effect on Laura ""Little Voice"" Hoff.  Furthermore, the  relationship between LV and her mother comes to its zenith when a fire  destroys their home.  The flare up is a momentous allegory for how LV's  rage will cause her to shed her old self and take on the life she was meant  to experience.
This picture is one of tumultuous family battles and the  struggle to become self-actualized. What I feel audiences will take away  from this film is the fact that the process of letting go is just as  important as that of grabbing on to the one thing which makes us feel  alive.
Let me also bring to the foreground that all songs were  completely undubbed and no lip-synching was involved.  In plain English,  Jane Horrocks genuinely performed and emulated all vocals that were crooned  in this film.  All the more reason to feel the force and craft behind this  zestful and rousing piece of work.",959040000,8,2375,4.79652605459057
1028134,4,6305428298,"An introverted young lady who cherishes her late father and keeps his memory alive through his beloved record collection is at the heart of ""Little Voice,"" directed by Mark Herman.  Jane Horrocks gives an amazing  performance as Laura, the shy girl with, as it turns out, a very big voice  and the uncanny ability to mimic Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe, among  others, to perfection.  She lives with her mother, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), a  vociferous floozy, in an apartment above their small record store.  Laura  (whom Mari calls ""L.V."" because of her retiring manner and the fact that  she rarely speaks above a whisper), spends an inordinate amount of time  retreating from her mother to the sanctuary of her bedroom and her dad's  records, where she immerses herself into the music, as well as the persona,  of whichever artist she is listening to at the time.  For the most part she  is ignored by her mother, who also dismisses L.V.'s talent purely out of  disregard.  Enter Ray Say (Michael Caine), a sleazy, contemptuous,  small time theatrical agent, who is picked up and dragged home one night by  Mari.  It isn't long, of course, before he discovers L.V.  When he hears  Judy Garland's voice coming from her bedroom, he thinks he's found the pot  of gold at the end of the rainbow; this has The Big Time written all over  it.  All he has to do now is figure out how to get L.V., the veritable  recluse, up in front of an audience.  Adapted for the screen by Mark  Herman, from Jim Cartwright's play ""The Rise and Fall of Little Voice""  (written originally to showcase Horrock's unique talents), the success of  the movie is assured by a cast that delivers quality performances all  around.  Jane Horrocks does all of her own singing, and when she finally  breaks loose it is truly a delight.  And Herman must be given credit for  not allowing it to be over done; he gives you just enough of L.V. to keep  it exciting and leave you wanting more.  Michael Caine gives an inspired  performance that easily should have won him an Oscar.  His Ray Say is so  finely shaded that you know exactly who and what he is, yet he manages to  overlay him with a smarmy, irresistible charm that keeps him accessible.  His rendering of Roy Orbison's ""It's Over"" is an unforgettable cinematic  moment.  Brenda Blethyn is outstanding as well, making Mari just unlikable  enough that you can still empathize with her when she finally gets her  comeuppance.  Ewan McGregor adds a subtle charm to the film as Billy, the  telephone repairman who finds a kindred spirit in L.V, and Jim Broadbent  gives a humorous turn as Mr. Boo, owner of the venue Ray engages for L.V.'s  debut.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Philip Jackson (George),  Annette Badland (Sadie), Fred Feast (Arthur) and Graham Turner (L.V.'s  father).  Funny, and touching as well, ""Little Voice"" is solid  entertainment well presented.  It's one you're going to remember, even  after, as Ray Say says, ""It's over.""",958176000,6,2977,4.740667976424361
1028135,5,6305428298,"Ah, this is just fantastic. Not just for Jane Horrocks who gives a mind-blowing performance as LV, an autistic reclusive girl who sings along to her father's old records - and impersonates Shirley Bassey, Marilyn  Monroe and Patsy Kline et al . . . brilliantly! Michael Caine, whose movie  career was almost destroyed by turkeys such as ON DEADLY GROUND and THE  HAND is also superb as a showbiz agent who hears LV singing her heart out  and tries all he can to use her to make money for himself, including having  an affair with her loud-mouthed, obnoxious mother who makes LV's life hell.  When Horrocks is singing on stage, this is the movie's best moment! Ewan  McGregor also appears as a telephone engineer who shows a personal interest  in LV. This is not the type of movie I normally watch, but when I sat down  with my wife to see it, it grabbed my attention and never let me go. But a  lot of recent British movies like this one have been well worth seeing.  Check out LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY too if you liked this, as its karaoke scenes  send up Jane Horrocks's stage acts well!

1028136,5,6305428298,"As it often happens nowadays, I was under misconception about Little Voice, thanks to the Hollywood advertizing machine. Constant TV  promotions gave me the wrong impression that LV was another one of those hilarious  British comedies about small-town folk that ""make it big"" (kinda  like ""The Full Monty"", where the guys ""made it big"" in  their own way).  Since I love British films, I rented it. I was surpised to  learn that this film is not about ""talent"", fun, or even music,  really... Rather, it is about human relationships of all sorts and shapes.  It is a simple story, told in a simple way (read: non-Hollywood way), but  it is as powerful as dozen of highly-praised stories/scripts  put together  could be. It is touching, and, though, I said it is not ""really""  funny, it makes you laugh thru the tears (mostly, thanks to the character  of LV's mother, played wonderfully by ?) and does have that weaked sence of  humor that we all love(fans of British cinema). I loved this film,  especially the ending.  Oh, yes, the actress, who plays Little Voice,  actually sang all the musical pieces herself....amazing voice, indeed!",957916800,,1136,4.863874345549738
1028137,4,6305428298,"Director Mark Herman's LITTLE VOICE is a refreshing but cruel comedy set in a small town of Northern England (or is it Scotland ?). L.V. -for little voice- is the only child of Mari Hoff, played by Brenda Blethyn, the widow  of a records's salesman. She doesn't talk to anyone and listens all day  long to the records her Dad has left. She lives in a dream and sings every  evening ""a cappella"" for her dead Daddy. One day, Ray ""  Michal Caine "" Say, one of the numerous lovers of LV's mother,  discovers her unbelievable voice and wants her for Mr. Boo's saturday night  show. That's the beginning of the rise and fall of Little Voice.
If you  liked Bill Forsyth's LOCAL HERO, you will be happy to find in LITTLE VOICE  the same love for unusual characters. Michal Caine gives here one of his  best performances ever and Brenda Blethyn confirms, after Mike Leigh's  SECRET AND LIES, that she is a great actress. Jane Horrocks, in the role of  LV, also gives a superb performance by imitating perfectly Judy Garland,  Marilyn Monroe and Billie Hollyday.
LITTLE VOICE can be appreciated for  its humor, its subtle variations on Victor Fleming's THE WIZARD OF OZ or  for its psychological implications. A very good surprise.

You  can't help but feel sorry for LV when you see what surrounds her.  It's  well worth renting, and definitely worth buying.  This one's a keeper that  you'll enjoy owning.

Hot Toasty Rag, November 24, 2017

Have you ever been to karaoke and theres that one person who isn't drunk but still thinks she has the most fantastic voice in townexcept shes pretty lousy but no one else seems to notice? If you belong to the rabble who have been sufficiently brainwashed into thinking that lady actually has a good voice, go ahead and rent Little Voice. Im sure youll love it, and think that Jane Horrocks is incredibly talented.

For the rest of you, youll probably do what I did when trying to get through this movie. Its a story about a young, very strange woman who listens to records of old singers incessantly to cope with her fathers death and her mothers meanness. Then, she decides to sing along, and she sounds exactly like the original singers! So, when Michael Caine, a talent scout whos recently started dating her mother, Brenda Blethyn, hears Jane singing, he decides to start promoting her in nightclubs. The only problem is, Jane is that woman at the karaoke bar who thinks shes much better than she is! She doesnt sound like Judy Garland or Marilyn Monroebut the audience is supposed to think she does. Not only is the entire point of the film completely lost to any audience member with ears, but Janes character is obnoxious and impossible to root for.
