5194433,5,B008YYSEBG,"nice to see it was on for purchase

i have to now use a certain amount of word to even leave a review and I think it ridiculous and a waste of time when I can leave a review of two or three words and get my point across",1355270400,,219,3.4693877551020407
5194434,1,B008YYSEBG,I leave in Dublin in Ireland. I should have DVD for region 2. I got DVD region 1. It doasn't work on my DVD player.,1355184000,,115,3.64
5194435,5,B008YYSEBG,"If your kid likes Gummibear videos they will love this. It's not high art, or tells any particular moral aside working together, but its fun and my four year old loves it.",1354665600,,171,4.375
5194436,5,B008YYSEBG,this movie is really cute considering i think the videos on youtube are stupid. my daughter loves this character and was thrilled to get the movie,1354320000,,146,4.653846153846154
5194437,4,B008YYSEBG,"We are always looking for new Christmas DVDs to our collection and ""Yummy Gummy Search for Santa"" is definitely stands out.  It is a DVD featuring Gummibar who is a YouTube sensation that we came across one day.  He is an animated green gummy bear that dances and sings, and it honestly is hard not to laugh at.

This new DVD is Gummibar's first movie and honestly it is a strange one.  The DVD is animated and the storyline is about Gummibar saving Christmas with his friend's help.  There is singing, dancing and strange characters.  My boys (4 and 5) have watched this DVD over and over since they got it and they actually dance along to it.  The characters are strange though and you may want to watch this before your kids if you are worried about it being scary or inapprorpriate.",1353456000,2,786,4.454545454545454
5194438,2,B008YYSEBG,Most characters look very evil in the movie. Totally with other review. The movie is not for kids. I hope I could return it.,1352505600,,124,4.208333333333333
5194439,1,B008YYSEBG,"Bought this movie for my kids and was not too happy with this movie. In my opinion this movie is not appropriate for kids, to be fair I should have noticed this movie was Not Rated before I bought it. The movie begins w/ Santa being made fun of by reindeer for being fat and goes down from there. Even without the inappropriate parts the movie seems very thrown together. Its a shame since my kids really enjoy Gummibars' music. I would recommend watching this before handing it off to your kids if you decide to purchase",1352505600,10,521,4.381443298969073
5194440,3,B008YYSEBG,It was a good movie I watched it with my kid but the songs in the movie are too short and the movie is too fast paced. Overall it was good.,1352419200,2,139,3.5161290322580645
5194471,1,B008YYSEBG,We bought this for our granddaughter for one main reason - she loves the gummy bear song and this dvd advertises the song is on the DVD - it even says it right on the front of the DVD box.  It is a scam - there is about 10 to 15 seconds tops of the song on the DVD.  Our granddaughter was very disappointed and so were we :O(,1468972800,,325,3.6956521739130435
5194472,3,B008YYSEBG,"I would have probably given this movie 5 stars because my grandson is tickled by all of the dance moves in it. However, the entire movie is found elsewhere on the Internet at no cost.",1464566400,2,183,4.257142857142857
5194473,5,B008YYSEBG,Cute little dvd. I can see how some parents would think it's inappropriate for older kids. Ut it's great for my 17 month old. He loves all the silly voices,1460160000,,155,4.2

5194514,5,B008YYSEBG,"Good movie and catchy songs for little kids. You need to watch it in a kid's view to enjoy it. If you're an adult or over 8 years old kid, you may find it boring. But the little kids will not care about the story line at all.",1416441600,,225,3.7083333333333335

5194541,5,B008YYSEBG,My Son loves--he made me watch it March. This movie is not made for adults.  Kids seem to love it.,1395964800,,98,3.9
5194542,4,B008YYSEBG,but as a parent I have to give it one less star just because this movie contains some of the most annoying voices and songs in existence. But from my 5 year old's perspective this is the best movie on the planet. She loves it.,1393286400,,226,4.044444444444444
5194543,5,B008YYSEBG,I ordered this for my 3 yr. old grandson. It came well packaged and in a timely manner. He LOVES it. The songs keep him very happy. That is a gift when you've been babysitting ALL DAY and you are a Grandma that is exhausted and needs to sit down for a few minutes!  I would highly recommend this DVD. It is a nice change from regular cartoons.,1392595200,,343,4.044117647058823
5194544,1,B008YYSEBG,If you thought the song was bad try watching a movie about it.  The worse part is there are hardly any songs in it. My 2 year old saw this and pleaded for 20 minutes for me to buy it. Its so bad he won't even watch it.,1386892800,,218,3.5416666666666665
5194545,1,B008YYSEBG,"Unable to play this DVD. On my screen it says can not be played in this region. I did order I am a gummibr, that one is working fine. What can i do? Really want this DVD for a little girl.",1386028800,,188,3.6097560975609757

5194550,5,B008YYSEBG,"My niece has an obsession with Gummibar.  She would watch it on YouTube incessantly.  So, for Christmas I purchased this DVD for her.  She LOVES it.... but needless to say her parents hate it.  Oh that Gummy Bear song gets to you after hearing it 100+ times per day!  But if you or a friend love the gummibar videos online, you'll like this longer video as well.  It's exactly what you expect it will be.",1378425600,,404,4.32
5194571,5,B008YYSEBG,"My grandson was so excited when we ordered this online and when it was delivered to his house. Came on time, and I just love to see the smile and sparkle in his eyes as he told me he watched it 3 times the day it came.",1375574400,2,218,3.6595744680851063

5194575,4,B008YYSEBG,"Yes, this movie it is cheap quality, the writing is pretty poor and the lessons it teaches are probably questionable to some parents.  But my 2-year-old who loves Gummy Bear couldn't care less about high quality computer animation, a cohesive story line or learning life's lessons from a movie.  He just knows he loves Gummy and the Gummy songs, which this movie delivers with the added bonus of a silly story line and additional characters.  If you're looking for a movie that does more than this, look elsewhere.",1364169600,,514,4.818181818181818
5194576,1,B008YYSEBG,My daughter really wanted to watch this because she likes the gummy bear song. It was horrible. Not worth renting for 3.99. Still don't know how she convinced me.,1361404800,,162,4.620689655172414
5194577,4,B008YYSEBG,My son really enjoyed the music in this movie. The packaging and everything looked brand new. Arrived promptly before christmas. Would definitely recommend for gummy fans.,1357948800,,171,5.615384615384615
5194578,1,B008YYSEBG,Expected more music and dancing just got a storyline that didn't flow very well.  Had a very hard time trying to figure out what age group this was meant for.  It was boring for all ages.  The only part my 3 year old liked was the special feature videos but that only provided about 10 minutes of entertainment all together.  Waste of money.  Better off looking up videos on YouTube.,1355875200,,383,4.414285714285715
5194579,5,B008YYSEBG,"My granddaughter turned 7 months old today, and already loves Gummy Bear.
