6676394,5,B00NPSXQDM,"Great action-packed movie although if you're expecting to see a lot of Steven Seagal because of the cover, you'll be disappointed. I guess they needed his big name to get the movie out - and it's worth it! Very good action movie with a main character who has a great heart. I've enjoyed the movie - twice. ;-)",1417737600,3,309,4.344827586206897
6676395,2,B00NPSXQDM,"I love the first song in the movie, but I haven't been able to find out who the female singer is. The lyrics start out ""i must confess i done you wrong...""",1417651200,2,155,3.875
6676396,3,B00NPSXQDM,"""If you want to live, if you want those you care about to live, you will do this."" Jack (Eads) is a poker player who is on a losing streak, and not just with the cards. When a chance meeting with a high roller gives Jack the opportunity to make some serious money he decides to take him up on his offer. When he is offered $20,000 to do something he doesn't want to do an argument happens and things go horribly wrong. Now that his life is in danger he is offered a way out. Jack must now decide what is more important to him. After watching so many of these cheesy action movies I was expecting yet another drawn out movie that could have been done in 20 min but drug out for 90. I have to say much like the recent movie Throwdown I was really surprised at how much I liked this. The movie is really nothing new but for some reason it drew me and I kept me interested the entire time. Overall, nothing amazing but this was very entertaining and I liked it much more than I expected. I surprisingly give this a B-.",1414368000,4,1014,4.075
6676397,2,B00NPSXQDM,"The film centers on Jack Daniels (George Eads) a drinker and gambler. He owes Pauli (Steven Seagal) money. Paulie takes a shine to him, but Carl (Vinnie Jones) who collects for Paulie doesn't. Jack gets involved with a rich man (Stephen Lang) who wants Jack to do different things (AnnaLynne McCord) for money, but not nearly as entertaining as ""Cheap Thrills.""

The plot was straight forward and plodded slowly without any character development. Even the title is a bit odd. Drawing two cards to an inside straight is really risky, stupid, and lucky in draw poker. However in Texas Holdem' starting out with two cards together and then building outside is not that remarkable.

Seagal and Jones are briefly in the film. Jones delivered his half dozen or so lines convincing. Seagal lit a big cigar and started talking like Marlon Brando while looking like Eddie Munster (see hair DVD cover). If that was your goal Steven, I was laughing with you. Might want to wait for a real Seagal film.

What I did love was the 60's kaleidoscope opening with a decent theme song. I thought I was going to watch a quality Bond film.

Mensa Porn Star Tia Carrere plays a small role as a stripper soliciting a drink at the bar. She is outsmarted by Jack.

6676417,2,B00NPSXQDM,"Gutshot Straight is a basic, slightly weird noir-thriller that was seemingly cast at random. The eclectic team of stars populating this one is its most unique asset, while everything else is predictable and firmly in the B-grade of cinematic standing. Its good for a lazy evenings repast, but its got no hope of becoming anyones new favorite.

The story: A hapless gambler (George Eads,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-Crime-Scene-Investigation/dp/B00008972G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</a>) is drawn into a vicious setup that places his life at risk.

In addition to Eads, the ensemble includes AnnaLynne McCord (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/90210/dp/B001G0MFD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">90210</a>) as the femme fatale, Stephen Lang (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B0044XV3R8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>) and Ted Irvine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>) as creepy weirdoes, Steven Seagal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Good-Man/dp/B00KNVF2SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Good Man</a>) as a mob boss and Vinnie Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snatch/dp/B000093FLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snatch</a>) as his enforcer, and Tia Carrere (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Relic-Hunter/dp/B003XEKUBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Relic Hunter</a>) in a three-minute role as a club lady. Despite most of the casts affiliation with the action genre, there is very little action here, but at the best of times, theres a decent amount of intrigue. Essentially, the plot boils down to a slain millionaire and a case of blackmail, and when the film kicks into gear, the angst experienced by the Eads character is palpable and compelling. Disappointingly, suspense collapses in the form of Seagals character, whos essentially written as a panacea to the lead characters problems and wrests an unconvincing happy end for the star.

Even before then, the film has trouble maintaining its level of suspense. Giving every impression of trying to stretch their screenplay to meet a required runtime, the filmmakers resort to several time-killing scenes  sometimes its a forced interaction between characters, and other times its simply Eads walking around aimlessly. Speaking of which, it doesnt help the movie that the Eads character is a thoroughly unlikable and uninteresting jerk. Most of the other major characters are at least mildly interesting, but whatever time Eads doesnt spend directly imperiled is spent being a cad and a loser. The times that the film does get interesting are due to the hard work of the story, not of the protagonist.

Among all of the performers whose name got drawn out of a hat to be in here, Seagal is the most curious. Its almost as though his scenes were filmed for another movie, given the abrupt change of tone the film undergoes as soon as he shows up, playing the mafioso persona hes cultivated for the last several years. I almost wish that Seagal were the main character, because even if this didn't actually improve the quality of the film, it at least would have made it shorter. As is, it feels overlong at 85 minutes, and I cannot recommend it to anyone but George Eads die-hards.",1451347200,2,3545,6.550106609808102

There were a few things that just didn't make sense at all. But the film was smooth without having places to make you fall asleep. This is definitely NOT a family movie because of the topless bar scenes, gambling night life, mobster style language.

6676479,4,B00NPSXQDM,"Just like others mentioned in their reviews, Steven Seagal and Vinnie Jones are guest starting in this one, which means they are in no more than two or three scenes in the entire movie.  The real star of the film is George Eads (first time I seen the guy), who plays Jack, a typical Las Vegas loser who always wears a bowling hat, earns money by cheating other players in poker, and is constantly looking to make easy money on the side.  Jack owes money to local mobster Paulie (Steven Seagal),...money he does not have. One night, he runs into a well-to-do gambler by the name Duffy who offers him a ""job"". Jack accepts Duffy's invitation to his mansion and once there he gets asked to f---k his hot and young ""wife"" while being watched...of course he will be paid $$$ for it...sounds like a ""dream-come-true"" proposition for any straight guy...I mean--what can go wrong? Watch and find out :)

Cool soundtrack, the song in the opening credits (The Spider) is so James Bond like. Too bad one can not buy the soundtrack nor individual tunes.  I have been looking all over for the songs from this film and no one seems to have them.

8679717,2,B00NPSXQDM,"This isn't a Segal movie. Segal plays a very small part in this, as well as Vinnie Jones, which was honestly misleading from the trailer. The story isn't anything great or intriguing. I will hand it to the actors, who all gave an exceptional performance. It's a slimy story, with slimy characters. If you like these kind of flicks, give it a shot. There are some good cinematography in some shots, but other than that, this film is slow moving and forgettable.",1497398400,,460,4.621951219512195
