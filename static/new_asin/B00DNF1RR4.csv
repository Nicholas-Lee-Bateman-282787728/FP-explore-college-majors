5834745,5,B00DNF1RR4,"It started off as a simple concept only to evolve into such a signature match for WrestleMania year after year to the point where it's not only one of the most anticipated PPV's each year but also something you keep in the back of your head as you anticipate when the winner will ""cash in.""  This concept is called ""Money In The Bank"" which is a multi-man ladder match where the object to the grab the briefcase which contains a contract that allows you to the opportunity to have a WWE/World Championship match whenever you choose for up to a year & it's resulted in some of the best ladder matches in not just WWE but wrestling period along with the ""cash in"" leading to some memorable moments so here's the anthology of each single match up to this point in time with The Miz hosting this set.

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Edge vs. Christian - This was the first ever Money In The Bank match where the object of the match is to grab the briefcase at the top that contains a contract to challenge any World Champion whenever he sees fit in the next year & before the match, watch Kane's intro because that was something to see with the ladders on fire. As expected with a multi-man ladder match, chaos all over the place with everyone going after Kane on the ramp before the bell, everyone diving on top of everyone else on the outside, Benoit crossfacing anyone in sight, Benjamin splashing Edge in the corner on the ladder, everyone fighting on 3 ladders at once, Edge T-Bone'd off the ladder, and Benoit's headbutt off the ladder that caused him to bleed from the head. I was here LIVE & to quote Joey Styles ""OH MY GOD!"" The show-stealer here though was Shelton Benjamin as he looked like Spider Man with the majority of the moves he was pulling off involving the ladders.
As a side note, there have been some edits from the original match involving Chris Benoit as his entrance has been remove, the audio commentary directed at him has been muted, and the close ups of him were replaced by different camera angles but the whole match was shown in full so this was far from a ""butcher job.""
WrestleMania 21
[The Ladder Match]

Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin - This match started off as a 6 way brawl between everyone & didn't stop with various highlights such as RVD's over the top dive onto Hardy & the ladder, Shelton using the ladder as a ramp for the running senton to the outside, Hardy's high suplex off the ladder, RVD's hard landing on the ladder after the Rolling Thunder, a triple powerbomb off the ladder, the showdown between veterans Flair & Finlay, Lashley showcasing his power, RVD's top rope dropkick with the chair, Hardy with a legdrop & side effect off the ladder, RVD's 5 Star Frog Splash off the ladder, and Shelton's showcase of athleticism throughout the match.  The bar was pretty set high after the first one the previous year but they were able to match it here.
WrestleMania 22

Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. King Booker vs. Finlay vs. Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy vs. C.M. Punk vs. Mr. Kennedy - This was the most loaded Money In The Bank yet as they increased the number of participants from 6 to 8 creating such moments as Finlay going out of his comfort zone with a high risk move onto everyone, the use a step ladder, one swanton bomb after another, the Hardys united then divided, Punk's tribute to Terry Funk with the airplane spin with the ladder, both an RKO & Book End off the top of the ladder, would Booker sacrifice his wife Sharmell for the case, the involvement of Hornswoggle, and Jeff Hardy being the highlight reel with the highest dive we've seen in this match to that point in which one person wasn't able to recover for it.
WrestleMania 23
[The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

C.M. Punk vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. M.V.P. vs. Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy (sorry, I'm a mark for that) - Anyways, you know that this match is set to be nothing more than a non-stop spotfest and boy was it ever. Morrison's moonsault off the top rope with ladder in hand & later taking a fall that every man watching felt, Shelton Benjamin's ""tower of doom"" powerbomb off the ladder & his fall out of the ring onto the ladder wedged on the outside, the Walls Of Jericho on the ladder, Carlito's ""backstabber"" off the ladder, and the return of Matt Hardy. One of the best Money In The Bank's matches yet.
WrestleMania XXIV
[C.M. Punk: Best In The World; Blu-Ray Version Of The True Story Of WrestleMania]

C.M. Punk vs. Kane vs. M.V.P. vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Finlay vs. Christian vs. Mark Henry vs. Shelton Benjamin - After the last couple of M.I.T.B. ladder matches starting to become a little ""routine"" when it came to the spots, this one had the ladders used in ways we've never seen before in more unique ways. Moments to look out for are the showcases of strength by Mark Henry & Kane, Christian clearly being the crowd favorite, Shelton Benjamin's leap off the ladder outside the ring, Hornswoggle & his ""ladder"", and the dark horse (no pun intended) in Kofi Kingston being the human highlight reel of the match. There were some botches for the stuff they were trying to pull off but overall, entertaining match & great way to kick off the show.
WrestleMania 25
[The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Superstar Collection: Kofi Kingston]

Kane vs. MVP vs. Christian vs. Matt Hardy vs. Evan Bourne vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Jack Swagger - Just looking at the amount participants, you know this is the BIGGEST Money In The Bank yet & as you expect, this was your ""car crash match"" full of spots: Dolph Ziggler doing his ""Zig Zag"" onto Christian off the ladder, Christian & Hardy wedging Swagger in between ladders in a way we've never seen before, Evan going ""Air Bourne"" off a ladder before later being hip tossed off a ladder straight to the floor, and Drew McIntyre falling off the ladder & landing in a way that had to make every man watching feel his pain. Unlike how in previous years, Kofi & Shelton Benjamin's performances stood out, Kane was that person for me this year by showing his power by catching Kofi & powerbombing him on a ladder followed by later squashing Ziggler in between the ladder before ripping the ladder in half...only for Kofi to later to try to use those pieces as stilts (I'm not making this up) & even throwing an open ladder out the ring with such force that it came close to hitting a fan in the front row. When it came to memorable spots & highlight reel moments, this wasn't the best Money In The Bank they've done but it delivered.
WrestleMania XXVI

Kane vs. Big Show vs. Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Dolph Ziggler - As expected in a multi-man ladder match, this was full of crazy moments & spots such as everyone went after the two biggest threats in the match right from the start in Kane & Show, Christian hip tossing Dolph Ziggler off the top of a ladder, Cody shoving Christian off a ladder & having him take out Big Show in the process, the spanish commentary table not making it through the first match thanks to Kofi Kingston, and Big Show doing a big splash on top of a ladder...with Christian & Matt Hardy underneath it. Big Show had a chance early in the match to climb a normal ladder but ended up breaking one of the steps & ended up destroying more of them out of frustration so he eventually pulled out his special re-enforced ladder that was so large & heavy that it took him a while to just get it in the ring leaving room open for Cody to go after Show's injured leg before delivering a memorable dropkick onto Kofi Kingston who was climbing the ladder. This new ladder was so heavy that nobody else was able to move it when Show was on it until Kane was able to tip it over & toss Show to the outside where he was buried underneath every single ladder in sight by everyone else. Kane then went on a rampage taking out the other competitors one by one including ramming Cody Rhodes into the back of an armored truck & chokeslamming Kofi Kingston ontop of the ladders that Show was buried under on his way to becoming SmackDown's Mr. Money In The Bank. This match was the quality you would expect with Show's personal ladder being a nice addition to the match.
Money In The Bank '10

Evan Bourne vs. John Morrison vs. Randy Orton vs. Mark Henry vs. The Miz vs. Ted DiBiase vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge - This match was different than the earlier ladder match in that it had more brawling in the match but still had various moments such as Mark Henry ""parting the red sea"" with two ladders, Maryse making an attempt to climb the ladder, John Morrison having an innovative way to get on the ladder to stop Edge & eventually getting trapped between an open ladder, Mark Henry delivering various World's Strongest Slams along with Randy Orton giving out RKO's out of nowhere, Henry dropping Miz on top a ladder...that was on top of Chris Jericho, Henry being taken out thanks to a series of signature moves, up to 5 men climbing up a ladder at once, Orton delivering an RKO right before being on the receiving end of Air Bourne, Edge's nasty fall off a ladder onto another open ladder...that was upside down, and the aftermath with the winner breaking character by getting real emotional.
Money In The Bank '10
[The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

Daniel Bryan vs. Sin Cara vs. Kane vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Heath Slater vs. Wade Barrett vs. Sheamus vs. Cody Rhodes - As expected in a multi-man ladder match, this was full of crazy moments & spots such as Daniel Bryan dropkicking Gabriel off the ladder, back to back to back to back top rope dives onto the outside, Sin Cara's unique version of a top rope superplex, Sheamus' powerbomb on Sin Cara through a ladder, the reunion of the Corre, Sheamus & Kane paying tribute to the Road Warriors, Slater being dead weight on top of a ladder before being swung off, Sheamus being chokeslammed on a wedged ladder...that didn't give, how Gabriel pulled off a 450 splash, Barrett delivering a Wasteland onto the floor, and Daniel Bryan showing he could put you in a submission from anywhere. This was the quality you would expect from a this type of ladder match.
Money In The Bank '11
[Superstar Collection: Daniel Bryan]

Rey Mysterio vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Alex Riley vs. Evan Bourne vs. The Miz vs. Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. R-Truth - You knew exactly where this match was going when all of the competitors decided to grab a ladder & bring it into the ring with them during their entrance. Various highlights including everyone targeting Del Rio right from the start with their ladders to the point where he was buried underneath them & Mysterio being throwing on top of pile shortly afterwords, Kofi & Bourne fighting on top of a ladder that wasn't open before having a unique tug of war with it resulting in Rey using it as a springboard for a frakensteiner, R-Truth on the receiving end of a atomic drop that hurt every man watching, the highest ""Air Bourne"" you'll ever see, the dangerous way Miz fell off the ladder that I'm surprised didn't snap his knee in half, Mysterio & Bourne literally climbing over others to get to the case, Swagger taking a page out of Bryan's playbook earlier in the night by applying a submission from anywhere, the unique 619 Mysterio delivered using a ladder, everyone fighting for the case at once, and Swagger taking a nasty fall off the ladder. Although this match was different than the one earlier, it was still quality.
Money In The Bank '11

Santino Marella vs. Tyson Kidd vs. Christian vs. Sin Cara vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Damien Sandow vs. Tensai vs. Dolph Ziggler - As expected in a multi-man ladder match, this was full of crazy moments & spots such as Cody Rhodes backdropping Sin Cara who turned it mid-air into a dropkick on Dolph, Dolph taking very dangerous falls throughout the match including one with Sin Cara, Christian's top rope splash onto the ladder, the involvement of Vickie Guerrero, Tensai's domination, the innovative way Tyson Kidd knocked Dolph off a ladder, Sin Cara having a case of ""deja vu"", and Cody Rhodes being speared off a ladder. This was one of those ladder matches that was a stunt show with the crazy bumps & spots with the winner of the match reflecting the same feelings I had, ""It's About Damn Time!""
Money In The Bank '12
[Blu-Ray Version of Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Big Show vs. Kane vs. The Miz - Just a few notes here in that this is the first MITB match were all men involved where former WWE Champions & with that stipulation, The Miz was able to make a surprise return earlier in the night & insert himself into this match. Big Show was dominate early causing him to be the odd men out with everyone working together against him from Cena's A.A. through a table followed by being buried underneath ladders. This match was less of a spotfest than we usually get this these matches but still had some entertaining moments like Cena's A.A. on Kane onto Miz who was laying on a ladder, Big Show destroying the ladder before bringing out his own personalized one, Jericho bring a chair into the match, and the fights at the top that still led to an entertaining match.
Money In The Bank '12

Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett vs. Fandango vs. Jack Swagger vs. Antonio Cesaro vs. Dean Ambrose - While the WWE Title Money in The Bank match later in the night featured former WWE/World Champion ""All-Stars"", this match focused on superstars of the future that featured many stories & moments such as the tag teams of Rhodes Scholars & Real Americans working together only to eventually face off, ladders used as weapons various times such a Barrett using a piece of the ladder rung to beat on Sandow, multiple backdrops onto the ladder, Fandango's sunset flip off the top of the ladder, Dean Ambrose taking a page out of Terry Funk's playbook, the creative ways Ambrose & Swagger & Cesaro tried to grab the case, Cody Rhodes busted open, outside associates getting involved, and one partner double crossing another. This was the action expected from this match.
Money In The Bank '13

Randy Orton vs. C.M. Punk vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian vs. Rob Van Dam - This match was subtitled ""All-Stars"" with everyone in the match being former WWE/World Champions with each one having experience in Ladder Matches including a few past M.I.T.B. winners which told multiple stories such as the participants teaming up to take out who they felt were the biggest threats right off the bat, the face off between Punk & Bryan, RVD's dominance such as the Rolling Thunder on a ladder, Christian finding Hornswoggle's ladder, Sheamus' crash & burn fall, all 6 men on 2 ladders at the same time (as seen on the DVD cover), Sheamus hanging from the case, the return of the 5 Star Frog Splash...from the top of a ladder, Daniel Bryan having a moment of dominance, Sheamus breaking the ladder in half, a mid-air RKO, and the appearance of C.M. Punk's ""associates."" This was no different than the previous Money In The Bank match earlier in the night that you got all the action that you would expect from this match with multiple men telling multiple stories but I have to give extra credit to the M.V.P. of the match being Sheamus as he took the biggest & hardest bumps throughout the match.
Money In The Bank '13

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion John Cena vs. Edge - John Cena was bloody & weakened from just surviving the Elimination Chamber match when Edge earned his nickname ""The Ultimate Opportunist"" as he cashed in his ""Money In The Bank"" at the right time.
New Year's Revolution '06
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence; O.M.G.: Top 50 Incidents; Satan's Prison: Elimination Chamber Anthology]

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion John Cena vs. Rob Van Dam - Rob Van Dam came in to a hero's reception while Cena was booed out of the building to the point where the crowd showed that they refused to anything to do with him while you clearly saw the sign of ""If Cena Wins, We Riot!"" & the crowd being very vocal about his lack of wrestling ability & staleness. Both men hit some big moves in the first part of the match like the cradle suplex & a big sidekick & trading fist before taking the match to the outside with Cena dropping a top rope axe hammer to RVD on the outside only for RVD to respond with a moonsault press off the guardrail followed by fighting in the crowd. Both men began taking things to the extreme bringing a chair into the match for various offense like RVD's skateboard into the corner & Rolling Thunder on onto the chair while Cena used it for a DDT & catapulting RVD directly into it as they continued to trade momentum countering each other's offense with things starting to get more out of control with the referee getting too emotionally involved, steel steps & a table involved in the match, and men who had both issues & alliances with the participants getting involved as well. While this match is mostly remembered for the crowd reactions & the result, the match itself was really good as both men played off each other very well.
As a side note, some of the fans explicit chants have been edited such as the chants of ""Same Old..."" have been replaced with ""You Can't Wrestle!""
ECW One Night Stand '06
[John Cena: My Life]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Undertaker vs. Edge - Edge had defeated Mr. Kennedy to earn the case on RAW earlier in the week only to once again be ""The Ultimate Opportunist"" as he cashes in Money In The Bank after Undertaker was beaten & bloody after a cage match against Batista when another WWE superstar also decided to make an impact on his return.
""SmackDown"" May '07
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Edge vs. C.M. Punk - Due to the effects of the Draft Lottery a week earlier, Jim Ross was giving his farewell speech to the RAW audience when Edge decided to interrupt him only for Batista to get revenge for Edge screwing him out of his World Championship match the night before leaving the door open for C.M. Punk to cash in.
""RAW"" June '08

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Jeff Hardy vs. C.M. Punk - Jeff Hardy had just won the World Championship from Edge in a Ladder Match but was clearly showing signs of exhaustion during a post-match interview with Jim Ross when C.M. Punk did the same thing he did the year before & took advantage of his opportunity.

[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Chris Jericho vs. Jack Swagger - Chris Jericho was giving his victory speech for defeating Edge at WrestleMania when Edge came out to get revenge & attack Jericho's ribs he injured with a spear only for Jack Swagger to take advantage with the quickest ""cash in"" to date...
""SmackDown"" Apr. '10
[Best Of SmackDown 2009-2010]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Kane - ...only for Kane to break that record months later as he won the SmackDown Money In The Bank Ladder Match earlier in the night while Mysterio had just defeated Jack Swagger only to be attacked post-match with Kane coming to his aid or so he thought.
Money In The Bank '10

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. The Miz - Randy Orton had just defeated Wade Barrett in a rematch from the previous night at Survivor Series but injured his knee before the match due to an attack by Nexus & showing effects of it afterwords when The Miz decided to cash in his title shot & keep watching as you also get exclusive post-match backstage footage.

SummerSlam '11

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Big Show vs. Daniel Bryan - Big Show finally ended his 9 year streak of not being a world champion (5 years if you count the ECW Championship) defeating Mark Henry in a Chairs Match before Henry attacked him afterwords opening the door for Daniel Bryan to do the one thing that Big Show had been encouraging him to do for weeks & cash in his title shot resulting in the shortest World Title in history.
T.L.C. '11

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. John Cena - Cena gave Punk notice to inform him that he was cashing in his title match the next week here in a match that went back & forth with both men trading momentum from time to time only for another man to make his presence known during the match resulting in an outcome that had never happen before with a Money In The Bank winner with the bigger story being how Punk not only reacted to what happened but what he did when another superstar came out to try & help the situation.
""RAW"" July '12
[Top 100 Moments In RAW History]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler - Alberto Del Rio just defeated Jack Swagger & Zeb Coulter in a handicap match but had his ankle heavily worked over throughout the entire match to the point where he wasn't able to stand which was the perfect opportunity for ""The Show Off"" to become ""The Champion.""
""RAW"" Apr. '13

As I stated earlier, this concept has led to some of the best matches in WWE & beyond while the ""cash in's"" have met to some memorable moments so those who love this type of matches with big bumps & car crash violence with the only negative I can say is that it got real annoying after a while to hear Miz somehow keep putting himself towards the end but I still highly recommend this set.",1376006400,5,21648,4.525172501916688

""Yesterday the official synopsis for the WWE Money in the Bank Anthology DVD was released. Today we have some more details to add.

First, we can confirm that this will be a complete compilation of every Money in the Bank ladder match to date, which for those wondering does include the first ever match from WrestleMania 21 in 2005 which Chris Benoit competed in.

There is no confirmation right now as to whether or not matches from the upcoming Money in the Bank 2013 pay-per-view will make the set but it is extremely unlikely those will be omitted, especially since the DVD is billed an `Anthology' and released late in the year.

Also, we're now able to reveal that exclusive extras contained on the Blu-ray edition will include ""cash-ins"" of the Money in the Bank briefcase.

Below is a list of all Money in the Bank ladder matches up to the present day. The total bell-to-bell match time for these is less than 4 hours. Of course, this is not including intros/outros, the upcoming MITB matches this year, nor runtimes of the new segments with host The Miz, all of which will make it into the DVD and Blu-ray in October.

5834775,3,B00DNF1RR4,"Haven't watched MiTB Anthlogy in full as yet but this could have benefited from a small documentary. I like that WWE added the cash-in matches on the blu-ray disc. I know the name Benoit is taboo in WWE, but was it that necessary to get rid of his entrance and block any commentary mentioning Benoit in the match?

I think WWE could have bought the price down for this one.",1384473600,4,373,4.328571428571428
5834776,4,B00DNF1RR4,"Just in case anyone is wondering, the first MITB with Chris Benoit is Heavily Edited and almost unwatchable. I don't quite understand why as the Elimination Chamber had very minimal cuts, this however is a huge butcher job. Chris's name is never used, PERIOD. So you get moments of silence everytime the action is on him, that's not the worst of it, when he is beating someone up they eliminate most of the crowd so all you hear is Chris monaing and groaning (think empty arena matches to get what I'm talking about here, no lie). The best part is his throat cutting guesture and suicide headbut are fully intact, go figure, MINUS the voices, except agian hearing Chris in agony. The should have just left this match off as it really stinks being this butchered.

Also, I'm not sure but it seems like the crowd has been diluted through most of the Disc, I'm guessing the ""HS"" Chants had to be removed and in doing so the crowd gets muted in some spots, at least as far as I can tell. I did not watch the ECW Match yet with Cena & VanDam but that must be a train wreck if the editing is this bad already just on Disc One.

One last thing, I hope you're a Miz Fan (as I am NOT), as he brags so much after his win (in character mind you) that you'll want to turn it off completely just to shut him up!

All In All this is my least favorite of the Anthologies, HITC & EC are far better!

***** UPDATE: 11/01/13 *****
Cena Vs. RVD - Match fully intact, they delt with the language by overdubing the ""Bad Chants"" with the Cena Sucks and You Can't Wrestle Chants, not noticable until they show the crowd and you can read lips 'lol'!

WAY TOO MUCH Miz on this release, he hosts it, has way too much commentary about himself and even backstage footage is shown of him coming off the title win. What about CM Punk (2 Time Winner), Edge, Kofi OR Anyone else? They do not have any interviews at all, it is like they wanted to give Miz his own release but no one would care so they made the MITB Set shine only for him!

My statement still stands, HITC and EC are far better  -  3.5 Stars!",1383177600,8,2076,4.18546365914787
5834777,5,B00DNF1RR4,"Hosted by The Miz, the compilation features every Money in the Bank Ladder Match in history. The match debuted at WrestleMania 21 in 2005, quickly becoming a WrestleMania tradition and in 2010 proved so popular that it was given its own annual PPV event. Several top Superstars have been Money in the Bank winners including John Cena, Kane, Edge, CM Punk (twice!), Rob Van Dam and many more. 11 of the first 12 winners have used the match as a springboard to winning a championship, and several times the match has helped a Superstar who has never win a World Championship break through to claim their first. Much like the Royal Rumble Match, the Money in the Bank match represents a golden opportunity for a Superstar to achieve immortality, and its entire lineage is presented here.
