5008520,5,B006O6GUFS,"My 7 yr old daughter loved this movie! She was very happy to add it to her collection of a million Barbie movies, lol!",1332115200,,118,3.9583333333333335
5008521,4,B006O6GUFS,"My 6-year-old daughter loves all things mermaid right now, so we were excited to learn about another Barbie mermaid adventure. After a few recent misfires on the Barbie movie front (Fashion Fairytale, anyone?), I hoped this one would go back to the better story-telling of earlier Barbie movies. Happily, it does.
Others have told the storyline, so I won't go over that, but instead will detail what I liked, and what I think could be improved.
First, what I liked most is that there are no (not a one!) Ken/boyfriend characters to come in and save the day, and/or be the ""prize"" at the end of the movie. I get so tired of movies/shows and even pop culture in general telling my young daughter that getting a man is the ultimate goal. I really liked that the Barbie character's main goal is doing well at her surfing competitions. And as a bonus, an executive-type woman offers her a sponsorship deal after the competition. It was nice to see a woman in a leadership role.
I also like that the story stays simple. There aren't a bunch of side stories happening at the same time.
The music is good, if a bit different. When the movie began, my daughter said she didn't like the main song (I think it's called, ""Do the mermaid""). It has a bit of an Australian aborigine feel to it. But by the end of the movie, my daughter was dancing along to the song, so I guess she got used to it.
I liked the surfing scenes. Merliah and her competitor have amazing surfing abilities. They do some spectacular surfing stunts. I assume a lot of what they do is impossible for actual people, but heck, in the world of animation, anything is possible. So why not have surfers leap up and do back flips before landing perfectly back on their boards?
What I don't like is the shape of the people's faces. The last few movies the people have looked more and more like aliens, with extremely angular, heart-shaped faces. I prefer the softer, more rounded look of the faces in earlier Barbie movies.
But again, my daughter loved the movie, and I did too. It's definitely worth buying so the little girl in your life can watch it over and over.",1331251200,2,2120,4.48062015503876
5008522,5,B006O6GUFS,"This sequel to 2010's Mermaid tale continues to develop the story around the conflict between Merliah's human and mermaid heritages. As with any such conflict, Merliah's ultimate happiness depends on her ability to reconcile both in her life.

I personally thought this movie was better than the first one.  As a parent, I really liked the messages about working together, forgiveness, overcoming adversity, learning to accept yourself and find joy when your life faces dramatic changes, facing your fears, and especially that there are more important things in life than winning.  I especially liked the closing scenes because of the message that some things are more important than beating the competition and that life can honestly feel a lot better if we allow other people to share in our successes. As a fan of the Barbie movies in general, I was thrilled that Kelly Sheridan voiced Merliah.  For me the voice artist change wasn't a deal breaker, but I definitely prefer Ms. Sheridan as the voice of Barbie. And, my daughter also really liked this movie.

There continued to be an emphasis on celebrity that I'm concerned about as a parent, though I was happy to see that while there was some commercialism in this movie, it wasn't as over the top as it has been in some of the recent Barbie movies.  Though, on that note, the preview for Fall's Barbie movie, Princess and the Popstar, has me thinking that the Barbie line is going to continue it's emphasis on celebrity, which isn't thrilling.  I also am concerned that this seems to be a reworking of the Princess and the Pauper concept, which I thought they did so well the first time that they ought to just leave it alone.  But that is the next movie...For Mermaid Tale 2, I would definitely recommend this movie.",1331164800,14,1774,4.7745098039215685
5008523,4,B006O6GUFS,I loved the movie.was happy that thay brought kelly sheriden to voice barbie. This is the first movie i brought since they changed her voice. I was mainly happy to hear kelly again,1330732800,3,180,4.484848484848484
5008524,5,B006O6GUFS,"Barbie in a Mermaid Tale 2 begins where the last one left off - Merliah is now a princess mermaid and her mother continues to rule Oceania.

Merliah wants to continue to be a teen and enjoy surf competitions while being human. But her mother wants her to transition into princess duties. It causes problems between mother and daughter as a big and important mermaid event approaches (Ceremony of the Tides - where the ruler's ability to make the magic merillia and heal the oceans is renewed). Meanwhile, Merliah's evil Aunt Eris has found the key to escaping her prison by using Merliah's human surfing competitor Kylie Morgan's jealousy against her. A new character, an angelfish named Allister, assists Eris' escape.

Barbie/Merliah grapples with issues of identity, responsibility, and being a gracious winner and loser in her surf competitions. As with most Barbie movies, she'll turn Raquelle (Kylie)'s jealousy from a destructive force into a positive friendship. And that friendship will be the key to Merliah accomplishing her goals and saving Oceania. It will also make Kylie a better person and help her reach her aspirations as well. There's a great message that bullying doesn't get you anywhere but that friendships transcend what any one person can accomplish alone.

In all, there are a lot of interesting characters this time and a lot of action - my 8 year old was entranced as she rooted for Merliah to arrive in time to prevent Eris from taking over her mother's kingdom. Especially fun are the band of bad guys - moray eels with a little electricity to boot (fun scene from the movie!). Also nice is that the dolls for the movie are inexpensive and all have speaking parts in the series - it makes play acting fun with so many characters to choose from.

Those who have enjoyed previous Barbie movies will be glad to hear that Kelly Sheridan is back voicing Barbie.

The barbie movies are always a great price and have a lot of replay value for the little ones. The two Mermaid Tales are some of the best stories in the Barbie movie series.",1330732800,30,2061,4.761904761904762

5008725,4,B006O6GUFS,"The DVDs were well packed. I received them in a timely manner but problem is I am located overseas, in Singapore to be exact and the DVDs are not playing with our Samsung DVD player or Xbox. We still have to use our MACBook pro to view it. So i think the region on the DVD is not set to universal so it can be played and watched anywhere in the world considering that Amazon's clients are not only US / CAnada based but all around the globe.",1344211200,,441,4.0227272727272725
5008726,4,B006O6GUFS,I ordered this as well as the first installment after having this movie on my DVR for months.

5008731,4,B006O6GUFS,"I'm more a fan of traditional animation and not so much a fan of these computer animated shows. But my seven-year-old daughter expressed an interest in this movie which is a sequel and I decided to rent it first to make sure it really was worth investing in (later found it being shown on TV so I just Tivo-ed it and saved myself some money!).

The storyline is interesting - Barbie returns here as a surfer/mermaid Merliah Summers. Merliah is very competitive and is going to Australia to compete for the ultimate surfing title. Merliah's ambition clashes with her duties as a mermaid princess and daughter to Calissa, Queen of Oceania. Calissa wants Merliah to fulfill her responsibilities as a mermaid princess and participate in an important ceremony called Changing of the Tides. However, this duty clashes with Merliah's surfing contest.

Meanwhile, the evil mermaid, Eris and her cronies plots to capture the throne of Oceania from Calissa. It is up to Merliah and friends to prevent Eris from achieving her goals. There are positive messages here such as being responsible for one's things, having a sense of duty, and what's important in friendship and sports.

The songs are ho-hum, nothing memorable, but the storyline is engaging and kept my daughter's interest. It is a fun movie for girls ages 5-8.",1336780800,,1312,4.927601809954751
5008732,5,B006O6GUFS,"This is better than the first Barbie Mermaid Tale, which was really good!  Daughter loved it.  Mom loved it.  Dad said ""most"" of the surfing is realistic!  Great story line with lots of action and beautiful animation.",1336348800,,217,4.783783783783784

5008736,3,B006O6GUFS,"Also, I found out they were showing this movie on Nick!!! So I DVR'd it and sent the movie back!! The songs on all her other Barbie DVDs are great; this one - not so much. In fact, my granddaughter has not asked to see this one again, and she usually watches her Barbie movies over and over.",1334448000,,291,4.0344827586206895
5008737,5,B006O6GUFS,"FIrst...lemme say...BRAVO for bringing back the ORIGNAL voice of Barbie! (Kelly Sheridan!) Yipeeeeeee!! Maybe all our letters to Mattel finally paid off. She is such a GREAT Barbie, I hope you decide to keep her for future movies and ditch the dumb blonde voice you had going on for FashionFairytale - Princess Charm school. I was beginning to think I'd never write another positive Barbie movie review again.

Thank You also for going back to my daughters FAVORITE movie and making a sequel! We all loved it! My girls (3 & 7) said they actually liked #2 better than the original, that almost never happens.
Great inspirational movie, love how there is no Ken in here to focus on.
Please keep these things in mind for your future movies. Remember your audience is little girls...not tweens who are into boys.
Oh and Mermaid Tale 3 would prob be appreciated in a few years too ;)",1334275200,,878,4.664516129032258
5008738,4,B006O6GUFS,My daughters have loved the Barbie movies for years.  This is another one to add to their collection.  They really enjoyed it and have watched it several times already.,1334188800,,168,4.758620689655173
5008739,5,B006O6GUFS,My three old and I both enjoyed watching this together and she has watched it a few more times on her own since. It's even better than the first one and I cant imagine watching it over this one at all now. I enjoyed the extra surfing and the story line and my daughter enjoyed seeing snout and zuma and aris again.,1334102400,,314,4.080645161290323

5008742,4,B006O6GUFS,"I have to admit, I truly enjoyed this one.  I do like most of the Barbie's movies, but Mermaid 2 actually held my attention thru the whole movie and that is saying something for a 40yr old. And another hit song too!! My 5 yr old loved the song Queen of the Waves, but she is loving Do the Mermaid just as much.",1332720000,,310,3.9206349206349205
5008743,3,B006O6GUFS,"I was watching this with my 6-year old and was amazed with the beginning of the show. Barbie and her friends were excellent surfers in a competition - daring, athletic, very cool. Before this I was not a fan of Barbie because it just seemed to teach little girls the wrong values. But after those first few minutes I decided that I needed to rethink Barbie. The new Barbie was confident, athletic and tomboyish. My daughter was so excited about Barbie's awesome surfing. But then Barbie's hair started to turn pink and the announcer started to comment on the mic, making Barbie so self-conscious that she deliberately crashed to hide her hair. That blew it for me. It actually *is* the same old Barbie. In the middle of an extraordinary competitive performance, she decides that looks are more important, and looking a little different is something to be ashamed of. Not the type of message I want my impressionable young daughter to be absorbing!",1332460800,2,947,4.780487804878049

8501606,1,B006O6GUFS,If you're looking for something cute for your mermaid-loving kid don't do it. It's trite garbage. Kids on the beach wearing next to nothing. Girls acting like airheads and talking about boys. Wish I could get my $10 back but oh well. This one is getting removed form our list because the kids couldn't stand it. I guess this is what typical Americans are feeding their kids. No wonder we have so many problems ...,1528675200,,413,4.52
