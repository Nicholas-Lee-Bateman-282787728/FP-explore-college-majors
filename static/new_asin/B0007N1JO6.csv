8049100,5,B0007N1JO6,"Husband bought ""Johnny and Clyde"" for me as a surprise...I'm a dog lover.  The dog and kid steal the show hands down.  I laughed a lot while watching this.",1456790400,,155,4.310344827586207
8049101,4,B0007N1JO6,"A Rare Treat!

(Okay, so if you've seen Christopher Guest's ""Best In Show"", I'm a BLOODHOUND man!  So much for Full Disclosure...)

I'm only giving this ""sleeper"" four stars because some fairly decent actors got shortchanged by a less-than-great script and budget.

But this movie - and particularly Clyde The Bloodhound - is hysterical!  Great movie for both kids & adults.

(BUT... Please don't watch this and then just go out and buy yourself a Bloodhound.  They are a wonderful, but not always the easiest, breed to actually own.)",1449532800,,534,4.932584269662922

8049103,5,B0007N1JO6,"Although I had the VHS version of this movie, I hadn't seen it for years!  When I was able to view it on the DVD version, I couldn't stop laughing, basically because of the Bloodhound, Clyde!  The human characters really were funny in themselves and the whole movie was really worthwhile to see it many more times.

I was really glad to see this movie come to DVD-it really was difficult to picture which part was funnier, because there were so many scenes that made buying it worth while.

The vendor was really great and I received the movie way ahead of the due date. I hope to do business again with this vendor.",1359072000,,616,4.37719298245614
8049104,4,B0007N1JO6,"Basically, that is what the bad guy is constantly threating the poor dog Clyde with the whole time. Johnny is sad because he moved but he didn't like it and he didn't like Clyde but they bacame frends. One time they almost got caught but they got away again and made it home before his mom did and put the bird back in the cage.

My favorite parts are when they rode a motorcycle away from the bad guys and he shouted hairball and then crashed his car. He got arrest by Johnny's dad the cop and he was the hero.

One question I still have is I wonder where they got their motorcycle clothes from and why Clyde had a hat on in the train at the mall. Does he have pockets?",1167955200,,670,4.030075187969925
