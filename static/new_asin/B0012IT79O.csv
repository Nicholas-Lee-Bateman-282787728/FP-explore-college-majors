3089585,4,B0012IT79O,"I really like this movie. In a sentence, it is about an Indian Air Force pilot who rescues a Pakistani woman who is on a noble quest, and they fall in love, but she is of course, already promised to another.

A large part of the movie is done as a series of flashbacks but it is not a distraction. At over three hours, Veer-Zaara is a long movie and the pace is uneven at times. There are scenes in the movie that do seem to drag on longer than needed. However, if I were the editor, I would not have wanted to cut anything out either.

This is a love story but it also touches on the rocky relationship between India and Pakistan as a natural extension of the relation of the main characters. This is a more somber movie than you might expect, but this is the nature of the injustices in this story. But the power of compassion and true love can not be forgotten. There are some fun times in the movie as well, and I really enjoyed the scenes with Amitabh Bachchan.

I watched this movie a few years ago and when I saw a Blu-ray version on Amazon, I snatched it up immediately and I am glad I did. The quality of the Blue-ray is quite good.

So set aside some time, order in some food (and make some chaat) and enjoy this movie with your family and friends.",1319155200,2,1258,4.122448979591836
3089586,5,B0012IT79O,"""Veer-Zaara"" is an epic love story, one which transcends borders real and imagined, and the message that true, abiding love will eventually overcome all obstacles is powerfully presented here. The story begins in Lahore, Pakistan where an idealistic young female lawyer, Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherjee) seeks her late father's blessings (at his grave) as she prepares to take on her first human rights case, that involving the unjust long-term imprisonment of an Indian national, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan).  Veer was accused over 20 years ago of being an Indian spy, Rathod, and was found guilty and imprisoned ever since.

As Saamiya eventually draws Veer out of his self-imposed silence, she learns about the love story that has inspired this silence - one which takes viewers via flashback to 22 years earlier. Viewers are introduced to a  young Pakistani Muslim girl, Zaara (the ever gorgeous, dimpled Preity Zinta) , the only child of a wealthy and influential Pakistani politician, who agrees to take back the ashes of her Punjabi nanny, Bebe, back to Bebe's native Sikritpur in India. Although I did question the credibility of such an important man allowing his only precious daughter to make a solo journey across the border, well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief here.

Zaara does make the trip and along the way, the bus she's traveling on has an accident, and she is rescued by dashing Indian Air Force Pilot, Veer Pratap Singh (SRK). The pair hit it off immediately, and not only does Veer help Zaara fulfill her nanny's last wishes, but also persuades her to visit his native village for one day, so that they may experience the Lodi Festival together. At the village, Zaara meets Veer's uncle and aunt (whom he considers his parents), played by Bollywood icons, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini (who despite her years, always looks gorgeous and graceful). It is also here, that Veer realizes he has fallen deeply and irrevocably in love with Zaara. When he prepares to  reveal his feelings to her as she is about to leave for Pakistan, Veer is introduced to Raza (Manoj Bajpai), Zaara's taciturn fianc (chosen by her father to cement a political alliance with Raza's father). Veer is heartbroken but this does not stop him from revealing his love for Zaara, which leaves Zaara all confused.

Well, back home in Pakistan, Zaara realizes that she too has fallen in love with Veer, and decides to elope with him. Veer goes to Pakistan to get her (after resigning his commission with the Air Force), but things go predictably awry and the pair are separated for more than 20 years. This is where Saamiya comes in , as she tries her best to prove that Veer was wrongfully imprisoned and to see justice meted out.

The songs are beautiful, and the cinematography conveys all the vibrant colors of the Indian countryside. The theme song is one that I fell in love with, and I plan on obtaining  the soundtrack. Shah Rukh Khan plays his role flawlessly, there is no exaggeration here - and I particularly liked the final scene where Veer reads a heartrending poem he composed as he addresses the court. Preity Zinta is beautiful and delivers a credible performance as a woman torn between doing her duty to her family and listening to her heart, and the courage she displays in choosing her own destiny. This is one of the most beautiful love stories to come out of Bollywood in recent years, and I heartily recommend it.",1272672000,16,3470,4.839797639123103
3089587,5,B0012IT79O,"This movie is an epic.  If you only saw one movie from and about India this would be the one to see.  The story, music, casting, cinematography, directing, etc are all first rate.  There is a bit of a harsh, startling moment right at the beginning that is very surprising and might cause some gentler viewers not to watch further.  It is the only moment like that in the whole film.  Keep watching to find the joy and charm of Bollywood at its best.

It might seem a little long for a date movie but that is just because we are so indoctrinated by the same old recipe we are fed on this side of the water.

This movie was BIG in India.  If I may be so bold, it was there ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and their ""It's a Wonderful Life"" rolled into one.

Also DON""T MISS THE OTHER GREAT INDIA MOVIE:  LAGAAN",1272499200,,796,4.143790849673203
3089588,5,B0012IT79O,"""When the right woman comes into a man's life, that's when he becomes complete.""

Unfolding slowly with the bright and vibrant colors of an Indian quilt, this rich and moving romantic epic is the more hopeful side of ""The English Patient."" Whereas that film was haunted by love, Veer Zaara revels in and embraces it. The notion that destiny can sometimes overcome circumstance because, in the end, love really is all, has rarely been so wonderfully presented.

It begins in shadow, however, as a young beautiful Pakistani named Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherji) comes to aid a man known only as 786 who has been imprisoned for the past 22 years. Saamiya knows his name was once Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) and when she uses it, the floodgates of memory open and ever so slowly the story of love which brought him there is revealed. It is her belief that once she hears it she can prove his innocence and free him, despite the handicap of gender presented in her country.

Veer is an Indian rescue pilot and Zaara (Preity Zinta) is a young Pakistani girl trying to bring her Bebe's ashes back home to India before she must return and marry Raza. It is an arranged marriage benefitting both their powerful and respected families but one that is draining Zaara's sprit. There is both humor and romance against the colorful backdrop of the two countries, which despite religious differences, director Chopra shows are closely tied together.

His Indian Uncle and Aunt, who have raised him, embrace Zaara as their own, and only when she must return does Veer learn she is bethrothed to another. He only knows he loves her and wants to be the one to marry her, but nothing of her feelings. It is a story of two hearts crossing borders, their love a river deep and flowing. When her sister Shabbo comes to Veer and lets him know how much Zaara loves him, he comes to the shrine to see her and sets in motion the tragic events which will lead the viewer back to the beginning of the film.

Khan and Zinta are terrific here but it is Rani's marvelous turn as a Pakistani girl going against tradition, very much like the love story of Veer and Zaara, which is the glue holding the film together. Like most Indian films, it is interspersed with the occasional song which propel the story forward. Some are quite beautiful and once used to their interjection as part of the narrative, are very enjoyable. For 22 years Veer has protected his love from dishonor but, once in court, Saamiya discovers something which will change all their lives forever.

Magnificently romantic and hopeful, the viewer is rewarded with an old-fashioned love story both visually and internally beautiful. Rare and rewarding, its brilliance tied to its simplicity, this is a masterpiece of the old variety. Its story of love tied to modern Pakistan and India is somehow timeless and not soon forgotten. Those wanting romance in their films will want to come to the valley filled with the season of love.",1272412800,5,2974,4.709615384615384
3089589,5,B0012IT79O,"Very satisfied with this purchase.  Great blu-ray quality.  The item did take approx 6 weeks to be delivered, so item is 5 stars, but delivery is 3 stars due to the wait.",1267660800,,170,4.28125
3089590,5,B0012IT79O,"This movie is an instant Bollywood classic.  This is like the ""Titanic"" of the Bollywood genre.  Greater than ""Slumdog Millionaire"" for family entertainment.  This film stars at least four very popular stars in Bollywood.  Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee (to me, the most beautiful woman in the world), and Anapam Kher. This movie is the ultimate example of what true love is, and I mean the ultimate sacrifice to give of oneself for the happiness of another.  Only stories like this can be written in India.  American writers couldn't even imagine fabricating a story like this.  If you see this movie, you will be hungry for more.

Bollywood in Blu-Ray, and to see our favorite Hindi stars in absolute High-Definition will give us the ultimate India culture experience right on our screen.  Some of the things that are important about enjoying Bollywood films are the good looking actresses and actors and their colorful fashion, and the beautiful backgrounds of India.  Even, to see a section of the slums in High Definition is what getting immersed into the scene is all about.

Yash Raj has many Bollywood classics, made even in just the past 15 years.  I know that I would buy these classics on Blu-Ray right away:  ""Mohabbatein"", ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"". ""Saathiya"", ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"", and ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"".  Plus there are other Bollywood classics that I hope to see released onto Blu-Ray, like: ""Lagaan"", ""Bride and Prejudice"", ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"", ""Bichhoo"", ""Badal"", and ""Ghulam"" and maybe a few more.

But, I generally watch a Bollywood film because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.

If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:

First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.
The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.
Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.
About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.
About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.
One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)

So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.

Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.  Check it out!

Realistically, I would only replace about 20 of my Bollywood DVD's with Blu-Ray discs.  And when these few films that I mentioned finally get released in High Definition Blu-Ray, then I'll celebrate the entire Blu-Ray experience that much more.",1265328000,3,4063,4.749287749287749
3089591,4,B0012IT79O,"I enjoyed the movie... correct, it is not that plausible... but I think we need to feed our minds and souls the idea of a love that endures over 20 years... that is 20 years without the promise of anything at the end.  These kinds of stories inspires one toward a life that stands for integrity with a heart as big as India.  There is certainly the effort to connect Pakistan and India in a way they've not known in the past.  It will take more than a movie, but makes for an interesting premise.",1210204800,2,496,4.2

The love story is a modern twist on Romeo and Juliet with self-sacrificing love being the ultimate love hear. A lot of tradition and history also brought in.

The supporting cast is right up there with them, and the music and dance scenes are some of the most memorable that Bollywood has to offer.  One thing I love about this film is its communication of good values.  The good characters have virtues that set them apart from the villains and give you a lot to think about.  And of course, I love the poem read near the end of the movie.  A great movie to show Bollywood newcomers to get them hooked hook, line, and sinker!",1320105600,,607,4.522935779816514
3324082,4,B0012IT79O,"I really like this movie. In a sentence, it is about an Indian Air Force pilot who rescues a Pakistani woman who is on a noble quest, and they fall in love, but she is of course, already promised to another.

A large part of the movie is done as a series of flashbacks but it is not a distraction. At over three hours, Veer-Zaara is a long movie and the pace is uneven at times. There are scenes in the movie that do seem to drag on longer than needed. However, if I were the editor, I would not have wanted to cut anything out either.

This is a love story but it also touches on the rocky relationship between India and Pakistan as a natural extension of the relation of the main characters. This is a more somber movie than you might expect, but this is the nature of the injustices in this story. But the power of compassion and true love can not be forgotten. There are some fun times in the movie as well, and I really enjoyed the scenes with Amitabh Bachchan.

I watched this movie a few years ago and when I saw a Blu-ray version on Amazon, I snatched it up immediately and I am glad I did. The quality of the Blue-ray is quite good.

So set aside some time, order in some food (and make some chaat) and enjoy this movie with your family and friends.",1319155200,2,1258,4.122448979591836
3324083,5,B0012IT79O,"""Veer-Zaara"" is an epic love story, one which transcends borders real and imagined, and the message that true, abiding love will eventually overcome all obstacles is powerfully presented here. The story begins in Lahore, Pakistan where an idealistic young female lawyer, Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherjee) seeks her late father's blessings (at his grave) as she prepares to take on her first human rights case, that involving the unjust long-term imprisonment of an Indian national, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan).  Veer was accused over 20 years ago of being an Indian spy, Rathod, and was found guilty and imprisoned ever since.

As Saamiya eventually draws Veer out of his self-imposed silence, she learns about the love story that has inspired this silence - one which takes viewers via flashback to 22 years earlier. Viewers are introduced to a  young Pakistani Muslim girl, Zaara (the ever gorgeous, dimpled Preity Zinta) , the only child of a wealthy and influential Pakistani politician, who agrees to take back the ashes of her Punjabi nanny, Bebe, back to Bebe's native Sikritpur in India. Although I did question the credibility of such an important man allowing his only precious daughter to make a solo journey across the border, well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief here.

Zaara does make the trip and along the way, the bus she's traveling on has an accident, and she is rescued by dashing Indian Air Force Pilot, Veer Pratap Singh (SRK). The pair hit it off immediately, and not only does Veer help Zaara fulfill her nanny's last wishes, but also persuades her to visit his native village for one day, so that they may experience the Lodi Festival together. At the village, Zaara meets Veer's uncle and aunt (whom he considers his parents), played by Bollywood icons, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini (who despite her years, always looks gorgeous and graceful). It is also here, that Veer realizes he has fallen deeply and irrevocably in love with Zaara. When he prepares to  reveal his feelings to her as she is about to leave for Pakistan, Veer is introduced to Raza (Manoj Bajpai), Zaara's taciturn fianc (chosen by her father to cement a political alliance with Raza's father). Veer is heartbroken but this does not stop him from revealing his love for Zaara, which leaves Zaara all confused.

Well, back home in Pakistan, Zaara realizes that she too has fallen in love with Veer, and decides to elope with him. Veer goes to Pakistan to get her (after resigning his commission with the Air Force), but things go predictably awry and the pair are separated for more than 20 years. This is where Saamiya comes in , as she tries her best to prove that Veer was wrongfully imprisoned and to see justice meted out.

The songs are beautiful, and the cinematography conveys all the vibrant colors of the Indian countryside. The theme song is one that I fell in love with, and I plan on obtaining  the soundtrack. Shah Rukh Khan plays his role flawlessly, there is no exaggeration here - and I particularly liked the final scene where Veer reads a heartrending poem he composed as he addresses the court. Preity Zinta is beautiful and delivers a credible performance as a woman torn between doing her duty to her family and listening to her heart, and the courage she displays in choosing her own destiny. This is one of the most beautiful love stories to come out of Bollywood in recent years, and I heartily recommend it.",1272672000,16,3470,4.839797639123103
3324084,5,B0012IT79O,"This movie is an epic.  If you only saw one movie from and about India this would be the one to see.  The story, music, casting, cinematography, directing, etc are all first rate.  There is a bit of a harsh, startling moment right at the beginning that is very surprising and might cause some gentler viewers not to watch further.  It is the only moment like that in the whole film.  Keep watching to find the joy and charm of Bollywood at its best.

It might seem a little long for a date movie but that is just because we are so indoctrinated by the same old recipe we are fed on this side of the water.

This movie was BIG in India.  If I may be so bold, it was there ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and their ""It's a Wonderful Life"" rolled into one.

Also DON""T MISS THE OTHER GREAT INDIA MOVIE:  LAGAAN",1272499200,,796,4.143790849673203
3324085,5,B0012IT79O,"""When the right woman comes into a man's life, that's when he becomes complete.""

Unfolding slowly with the bright and vibrant colors of an Indian quilt, this rich and moving romantic epic is the more hopeful side of ""The English Patient."" Whereas that film was haunted by love, Veer Zaara revels in and embraces it. The notion that destiny can sometimes overcome circumstance because, in the end, love really is all, has rarely been so wonderfully presented.

It begins in shadow, however, as a young beautiful Pakistani named Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherji) comes to aid a man known only as 786 who has been imprisoned for the past 22 years. Saamiya knows his name was once Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) and when she uses it, the floodgates of memory open and ever so slowly the story of love which brought him there is revealed. It is her belief that once she hears it she can prove his innocence and free him, despite the handicap of gender presented in her country.

Veer is an Indian rescue pilot and Zaara (Preity Zinta) is a young Pakistani girl trying to bring her Bebe's ashes back home to India before she must return and marry Raza. It is an arranged marriage benefitting both their powerful and respected families but one that is draining Zaara's sprit. There is both humor and romance against the colorful backdrop of the two countries, which despite religious differences, director Chopra shows are closely tied together.

His Indian Uncle and Aunt, who have raised him, embrace Zaara as their own, and only when she must return does Veer learn she is bethrothed to another. He only knows he loves her and wants to be the one to marry her, but nothing of her feelings. It is a story of two hearts crossing borders, their love a river deep and flowing. When her sister Shabbo comes to Veer and lets him know how much Zaara loves him, he comes to the shrine to see her and sets in motion the tragic events which will lead the viewer back to the beginning of the film.

Khan and Zinta are terrific here but it is Rani's marvelous turn as a Pakistani girl going against tradition, very much like the love story of Veer and Zaara, which is the glue holding the film together. Like most Indian films, it is interspersed with the occasional song which propel the story forward. Some are quite beautiful and once used to their interjection as part of the narrative, are very enjoyable. For 22 years Veer has protected his love from dishonor but, once in court, Saamiya discovers something which will change all their lives forever.

Magnificently romantic and hopeful, the viewer is rewarded with an old-fashioned love story both visually and internally beautiful. Rare and rewarding, its brilliance tied to its simplicity, this is a masterpiece of the old variety. Its story of love tied to modern Pakistan and India is somehow timeless and not soon forgotten. Those wanting romance in their films will want to come to the valley filled with the season of love.",1272412800,5,2974,4.709615384615384

3324087,5,B0012IT79O,"This movie is an instant Bollywood classic.  This is like the ""Titanic"" of the Bollywood genre.  Greater than ""Slumdog Millionaire"" for family entertainment.  This film stars at least four very popular stars in Bollywood.  Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee (to me, the most beautiful woman in the world), and Anapam Kher. This movie is the ultimate example of what true love is, and I mean the ultimate sacrifice to give of oneself for the happiness of another.  Only stories like this can be written in India.  American writers couldn't even imagine fabricating a story like this.  If you see this movie, you will be hungry for more.

Bollywood in Blu-Ray, and to see our favorite Hindi stars in absolute High-Definition will give us the ultimate India culture experience right on our screen.  Some of the things that are important about enjoying Bollywood films are the good looking actresses and actors and their colorful fashion, and the beautiful backgrounds of India.  Even, to see a section of the slums in High Definition is what getting immersed into the scene is all about.

Yash Raj has many Bollywood classics, made even in just the past 15 years.  I know that I would buy these classics on Blu-Ray right away:  ""Mohabbatein"", ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"". ""Saathiya"", ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"", and ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"".  Plus there are other Bollywood classics that I hope to see released onto Blu-Ray, like: ""Lagaan"", ""Bride and Prejudice"", ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"", ""Bichhoo"", ""Badal"", and ""Ghulam"" and maybe a few more.

But, I generally watch a Bollywood film because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.

If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:

First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.
The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.
Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.
About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.
About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.
One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)

So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.

Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.  Check it out!

Realistically, I would only replace about 20 of my Bollywood DVD's with Blu-Ray discs.  And when these few films that I mentioned finally get released in High Definition Blu-Ray, then I'll celebrate the entire Blu-Ray experience that much more.",1265328000,3,4063,4.749287749287749
3324088,4,B0012IT79O,"I enjoyed the movie... correct, it is not that plausible... but I think we need to feed our minds and souls the idea of a love that endures over 20 years... that is 20 years without the promise of anything at the end.  These kinds of stories inspires one toward a life that stands for integrity with a heart as big as India.  There is certainly the effort to connect Pakistan and India in a way they've not known in the past.  It will take more than a movie, but makes for an interesting premise.",1210204800,2,496,4.2

The love story is a modern twist on Romeo and Juliet with self-sacrificing love being the ultimate love hear. A lot of tradition and history also brought in.

If I heard Englidh, I wouldn't spend so much time on reading. I wish there were more Blu-Ray DVDs of SRK's movies there. Thank you!",1382572800,,309,4.535714285714286

3324145,5,B0012IT79O,"Entertainment Value = 10/10 (As long as you were not hired to rate the movie for history channel, you'll be thoroughly entertained)

Story = 10/10 (Grand idea; don't know if it has happened in real life or not, but grand nevertheless. I'd compare this movie to Titanic if Titanic wasn't based on real events)

Scenic Value = 8/10 (Many beautiful shots but nothing out of this world)

Acting = 9/10 (-1 point because SRK overdid the shaking a bit)

Accuracy = 8/10 (Accuracy score would have been lower if it was a documentary or based on a true story)

WARNING: Next line may contain a spoiler.

Special Effects = 4/10 (Come on. A toy bus covered with genie flames?. Strangely though, in a grand story like that, that didn't hurt as much since it wasn't significant compared to the other emotions)

Music = 10/10 (You can listen to this music over and over again and replay the movie in your mind)

Direction = 10/10 (Yash Chopra really knew how to touch people)

Overall = 10/10 (I don't watch too many Indian movies anymore. I go for only movies that people can't stop talking about and I'm glad this one didn't disappoint).",1351987200,,1126,4.562189054726368

3324148,5,B0012IT79O,"This beautiful and tragic tale is a Bollywood masterpiece.  SRK and Preity Zinta make a fantastic couple and deliver stellar performances.  The supporting cast is right up there with them, and the music and dance scenes are some of the most memorable that Bollywood has to offer.  One thing I love about this film is its communication of good values.  The good characters have virtues that set them apart from the villains and give you a lot to think about.  And of course, I love the poem read near the end of the movie.  A great movie to show Bollywood newcomers to get them hooked hook, line, and sinker!",1320105600,,607,4.522935779816514

8246044,3,B0012IT79O,"Wow, this movie has a overwhelming number of 5 star reviews. Now I see I will be the first 3 star review. - Good movie no doubt but not the best one on our short list [5] of Bollywood movies as the others rated it. I guess the ratio of 5 stars reviews got my expectations up too high. Or perhaps I need to see a movie without SRK for a change

 What's with all SRK's shaking? Estimate he was approx. 28 yrs old as a helicopter pilot then 22 yrs in prison = only 50 yrs old & was absurdly trying  to  shake like a old man in his 70-80's - it did not look right - looked fake  & very distracting. He did not pull it off. - Stick to comedy.  [yes, I know Bollywood wants us to throw realism out the door but still very distracting]. Surprising we did not experience the ""bring your hankies/ tear jerker effect [OK.maybe  a little during his speech to the judge] but certainly not to the degree the other 80 reviewers said it would be.

Bollywood always delivered the whole pkg to us, humor, romance, dancing, sometimes some wild car chases, music, drama, & choked up tears at the end. We give 5 stars to every other [4] Bollywood movie we've seen,  and as us Bollywood movie fans know, they run a lot longer than Hollywood movies but the time just rushes by - not the case in this movie, clocking in at 3 hrs & 15 minuets, it did drag & I was looking at the clock for the first time. - I think it was that the sadness ran throughout a good part of the movie with no breaks for humor that made it seem longer - it dragged & this was the first time a Bollywood movie did that.

So as one could see this movie was a let-down for us, I guess the 5 star reviewers thought it was the ""Gone with the Wind"" of Bollywood but I don't want to watch that movie either. So far we both rank ""The Chennai Express"" as the best Bollywood we've seen because it had ALL the elements of a Bollywood movie including the hankies at the end.

So now we are at a stand-still with Bollywood movies after seeing the one, the first one to pull a hold on renting others. If some other reader  of this post, [I doubt it make make a difference with all the  5 star reviews] has a suggestions of other Bollywood movies to rent - [knowing what we like] best we appreciate any suggestions.

Oh, I forgot to mention, we really noted the Pakistan / India countries clash -  a lot of people don't know that is it still happening on at an intense level TODAY. therefore, this movie gives a true history lesson regarding that. That will fly overs viewer heads if they are not keeping up with today's news.",1495411200,2,2564,4.120481927710843
