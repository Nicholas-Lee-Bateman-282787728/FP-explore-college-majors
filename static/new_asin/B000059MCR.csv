7934080,3,B000059MCR,"I used this video as part of teaching unit on ""Sing Down the Moon"" by  Scott O'Dell.  My fifth grade students totally enjoyed the connection of the story to the video as we were able to put visual images to the words we had been reading.  It was disappointing though that much of the history was related to the Anasazi, the Pueblo people's ancestors, and not as much history about the Navajos.  The flute music was also nice.",1384300800,,425,4.410256410256411
