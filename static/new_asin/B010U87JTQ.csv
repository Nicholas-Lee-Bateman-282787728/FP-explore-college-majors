8723201,3,B010U87JTQ,"This is a review of this Blu-ray collection, and not the individual movies themselves (there's Rotten Tomatoes for that).

I found this in the $7.88 Blu-ray bin at Walmart. When I saw that it was >$20 on Amazon, I thought someone had left it there by mistake, as it was the only one and did not seem to fit. Both The Possession and Sinister contain all the special features, including the audio commentaries, of their individual releases. Unfortunately, The Cabin in the Woods, the main reason I bought this collection, features only the film, with no special features at all. That was a little disappointing, but forgivable for the price - I basically paid $8 for Cabin and got two bonus movies for free, is how I see it. The Ultraviolet codes for Cabin and Sinister still worked, but The Possession's code seemed to have expired. Overall, this was well worth $8. For $20+, not so much.",1456617600,6,887,4.649681528662421
