8206519,2,B000SRH59Y,"I'm a huge MINI fan, otherwise I'd give this disk zero stars. This is the very essence of shabby production, with no menu and no chapters... NO CHAPTERS! The two races shown are on one large chapter, making any sort of navigation impossible. As for the race footage, it is acceptable, but certainly nothing that makes up for the other flaws of this release.",1198627200,6,357,4.59375
