3673840,5,B001KWB0L0,"This film is running on Sundance, it's worth watching because it asks you to consider if Monsanto is ""science"" driven, or money driven. Then the film supplies the history and documentation of Monsanto and a wealth of people to understand the process of how this company gets its positions on your table.  If you think regulation ""works"" you maybe will be interested in asking, ""for whom""? It's hard to watch, for me, knowing I have cancer, knowing the high price of a food industry driven by profits. Ah well, watch and consider this from your point of view. This was just a short statement on seing this, I'd like to own it to watch more slowly.",1259020800,13,646,4.568965517241379

The fact that the American Amazon store is selling it for almost a hundred dollars (when you can get it at tthe Amazon.ca webstore for much cheaper and at [...] for about 20 dollars) should give you an idea of just how powerful this documentary is.
This documentary has gotten critical acclaim and is very well researched. Monsanto wants to OWN the food chain and if we are not careful they will complete their plans. Remember these are the same people that told us PCB's and Dioxin where good for us. Why is a chemical company given so much power over our food? Why aren't the American people aware of just how much genetically modified organisms are a part of our everyday food? This documentary gives a clear picture of the issues and answers.

Once we stop rotating crops and allowing the land to lay fallow for a season or two, we use Nitrogen-Potassium-Magnesium as the only nutrients we chemically give the soil, it is not healthy.

I didn't watch this yet. I still didn't watch the special features parts of Food Inc and I got that about two weeks ago. Food Inc was a draining and upsetting DVD to watch for me. But I know the few scenes and few minutes when you saw the animals wasn't just the tip of the iceberg. It's more the tip of a submerged,frozen continent. Billions of animals are imprisoned and slaughtered every year. 8 and 1/2 billion per year in America alone. 58 billion worldwide. These are only air-breathing animals. Animals in freshwater and saltwater, fish,shrimp,crabs,etc are not in this number. I wonder how many other people cried  during the animal prison,CAFO and slaughterhouse parts or yelled ""MURDERERS"" and ""They're NOT Food"" at the television screen or at the big screen when Food Inc was shown in theatres at its first-run release. Someone told me I should see it when it was at theatres but I never got around to it when it was new.

(Activism on a whole new level would be screenings of Food Inc with animal rights people doing Rocky Horror Picture Show audience participation and response. We'd probably be arrested since we actually have a genuine purpose that is in direct conflict with multi-billion dollar interests. Along with Christian Conservatives,Tea Party members,constitutional rights advocates and pro-lifers,animal rights people are marked as a terrorist group. Pro-life grandmas at quilting bees and vegan teenagers protesting fur find common ground in their status as the New American Terrorists).

I have mixed feelings about Monsanto. GMO's aren't one of my main subjects but you can't avoid noticing their relevancy in the red letter BEWARE category.

Drought resistant crops are the difference between life and death in the event of drought or prolonged drought in a large agricultural area. The difference between eating and starvation.

But we grew food in ""life before Monsanto"". But the population has also grown. So has our trade with other countries and our food support for other countries. Someone told me the single chemical or the single man made thing that has saved the most lives is DDT. A Monsanto agricultural chemical that,without which,from crop destruction from insects or bad harvests,or because of increased harvests,food production was able to support the population. I'm not sure what he meant by ""saved the most lives"". Sometimes that means ""allows people to have ample food"". And sometimes that means ""people were in imminent danger of starving to death"".

On the other hand,Monsanto has gotten quite big. Expanded their ability to affect and control agriculture on an enormous scale. Are they,or did they,develop drought resistant crops in order to use LESS water resources in agriculture? Are the massive levels of certain crops genetically modified to serve as animal feed? I mean I know they are. Corn is one of the biggest GMO crops. And most if not all animal feed contains corn. I've seen corn in most cat and dog foods,also. But is that the reason the GMO corn was developed? Not to be a food supply in drought conditions, but to simply grow massive amounts to supply the slaughter-animal animals? Even egg laying chickens and dairy cows are slaughtered for food after their short,unnatural and miserable lives. Whatever answer would be given,if it hasn't already been answered,is the answer that probably is the most acceptable one that seems best. The ""we're the good guys"" answer that makes Monsanto look best. Like the GMO corn or crops were developed and grown as an emergency food supply in case of drought. Not to grow massive amounts of corn or crops just to provide food for the animal suffering and insane cruelty of our meat,dairy and egg industries. .

It is insane to make a GMO crop drought resistant and grow massive amounts of it,in order to produce an equally insane amount of food for slaughter-animal feed. Our animal-product consumption and trade has also grown to insanely high proportions. Am I the only one who got mad and stayed mad and is still mad about our ""cattle beef trade"" with South Korea? There might not be many of us,but I am one who is angry about our ""cattle"" trade with South Korea;I'm the only one I know of,however.

The capacity to feed people in the ratio of grain to meat or animal products,is 32 to 1. It takes 16 pounds of grain/cultivated crops to produce one pound of meat. The formula is doubled as the amount of grains a person would consume in one day is 8 ounces. And that seems to be in a famine setting. Yes you could live on a half pound of barley or rice or beans a day. But that is actually a substantial amount of food. If you cook one pound of rice or barley or beans,it is quite a lot of food. Half of it is still quite a lot. If the 8 ounces is broken up into wheat here,as bread or pasta and beans there as protein,it resembles a less famine type of diet. Fruits and vegetables with some plant-based oils are a normal,healthy style of eating. I won't say typical because the typical American diet is unhealthy,high calorie and deadly. Look at the mega billions of dollars spent on prescriptions and medical treatments for food-related diseases in America.

 Sixteen and a half billion dollars per year on obesity alone.

Heart disease. Cholesterol disease like high blood pressure,inflammation and fibromyalgia;stroke. A stroke is your brain having a heart attack. Blocked arteries or blocked blood flow in the brain. Diabetes caused by sugar. Alcohol related diseases and how they kept saying over and over in the media,that,drinking is good for you. Alcohol is another use of grain, corn, potatoes etc. Crops. Agricultural resources.  Drinking wine after dinner was one of the things they repeatedly said in the media. Drinking a beer 3 to 5 times a week. ""Chocolate is good for you"". Things that are addictive and high calorie,and people often don't stop at just a little bit. And they encouraged people to consume,saying it is ""healthy"".  But they also reported things like""the morning is the worst time to exercise"". People who work might only have the energy and the time to exercise in the morning if they make it a point to wake up early and make the time to exercise. And later in the day it might be impossible to have the time and energy to exercise. So some study was in the news saying the only time so many people might be able to exercise,was the worst time to exercise. (Those medical reports in the news broadcasts are NOT in the news because they are newsworthy. Those reports have been paid for,just like a commercial. Because it seems,to the public,when it is in a news report,that it has more validity and importance. Again this is controlling how people perceive it,another clever,psychological trick of advertising. Also I heard numerous studies with different situations saying ""no findings in medical studies show vitamins have any benefits"". Like a certain vitamin didn't help cancer according to research. And another vitamin showed no benefit for something else. Always bad reports about how inadequate vitamins are when the medical industry does a study or research. But they give glowing reports on new drugs for diseases that they want people to know about and ask their doctor to prescribe.

More crops are used to make high-calorie-no-nutrition snack foods. Sugary foods like ice cream or candy or bakery cakes and cookies. Sugar is also a crop. It's grown and cultivated and harvested. So much good food is loaded with sugar when it doesn't even need to be there. Then there are the salty high- calorie-no-nutrition snack foods like potato chips and corn chips and whatever else they're stocking the shelves with in the store aisles that I NEVER go down.

High calorie flavored sugary carbonated water. Sodium and sugar;a double whammy. Suicide by grocery store choices. Slower but just as sure as any more immediate way of killing yourself. ""You dig your grave with your teeth"". My parents and grandmother used to say that;maybe nobody says it now. But it's still true.

And I didn't cover ALL of the territory. I was talking about over-producing crops and the GMO crops are perhaps a more efficient way to produce more crops than we actually NEED for healthy food. And,look at what is made with those crops. Those tilled acres. And all the resources that goes to grow the crops. Water. Fossil fuel in all stages where energy is used in moving or harvesting the crops,along with creating the products and shipping them to the consumer level at point of purchase. Packaging. A cost of resources and energy not often considered as an agricultural expense. But it is. Frito bags. Beer bottles. Canisters for Pringles. Cellophane wrapping and waxed thin cardboard for cupcakes with frosting and creamy centers.

Are the GMO crops being grown for massive production to feed animals to produce foods which are not needed as protein or vitamin sources? Plant-based proteins are not unhealthy. Animal-based proteins ARE unhealthy. There are no vitamins or minerals in animal-based foods which are not abundantly available in plant-based foods.

So WHY are we producing billions of tons of food to feed animals which will in turn supply 1/16 the amount of food as they were fed? Do people invest 16 dollars to make one dollar on their investment? The answer is no.  To make back your first investment of 16 dollars you would need to spend 256 dollars.

Investors DON'T DO THAT. So why is our American agricultural so invested in our meat industry? And why are we growing crops to produce food that has no nutritional value like our snack food and soda pop industries?

This is why I wonder about Monsanto and the GMO crops. Is there an artificial scenario to say there is cause to grow these crops? There is no drought but we can grow so much MORE using so much LESS water if we grow this GMO drought-resistant crop. For what? To torture cows and make them live completely hellish lives only to be slaughtered at 1/7 of the age they would be if they lived and died having their natural lifespan? In Food Inc you see poor cows or bulls with no horns, crammed all together in a CAFO ankle deep in manure and urine, squeezing their eyes closed from the sting of the ammonia in the sea of urine they're surrounded by. I also think the chemicals they're exposed to hurts their eyes also. I've seen cows in fields,in pictures,and they're in the food chain,and their eyes always look irritated. They look like they're mad or angry. But I think it's because what they eat is not fit for human consumption and is tainted with agricultural chemicals. Which have toxic heavy metals in them. Toxic heavy metals are essentially poisons.

The animals in the food chain or in CAFOs,or that will be sent to CAFOs can't escape. They can't force their way out. They can't say ""I don't want to go to that place"". They're going to be unmercifully,brutally evilly slaughtered. By a monster. By man. And THIS is our tax dollar investment in our agricultural budget. For hamburgers. And Fritos. Is THIS why we grow insane amounts of crops? To make food,using water,tilled acres,energy(let's not forget refrigeration. From the minute the hide is ripped off the cow or pig,or baby veal calf,or the egg is taken from the battery cage hen or the milk is cruelly drained from the factory farm housed dairy cow,there is refrigeration. Electricity. Coolant. Pollution. Carbon. CO2. Climate-change-global-warming-thermal-units. From the instant the product can begin deteriorating, spoiling,decomposing,till it is purchased or manipulated into another form when it is not bought,like spoiled milk becomes whey or yogurt or ice cream and meat goes to restaurants or other pre-packaged foods,again using yet more energy and electricity and making more packaging)...it is refrigerated. Or frozen. This is insanity.

Is THIS why Monsanto produces insane amounts of crops?

Like I said. I didn't watch this DVD yet. But I'm going to. Food Inc spent enough time giving information about Monsanto so I'm certain enough of what I'm writing. Food Inc doesn't state what I write. But it does show an unimaginably high mountain of corn. Off the cob. Like a mountain of popcorn before you pop it. What do they do with it? I don't think I'm too far off track and in fact,given the other facts of food I know are true,I think I have a good idea of what they do with it. But nobody tells us THAT. Our tax dollars subsidize agricultural spending. Our agricultural spending subsidizes growing and buying agricultural chemicals for the meat and animal products industries. And look at all the aisles and shelves devoted to unhealthy foods. Meat eggs dairy fish. All cholesterol. All eventually contributing to cholesterol related diseases. Am I wrong? Look at cholesterol prescriptions. Heart disease. Stroke. High blood pressure. Am I wrong? Count the prescriptions. Count the deaths. Am I wrong? Look at all the sugar aisles. Pop. Bakery. Ice cream. Cookies. Candies. Sweet snacks. Sixteen and a half billion dollars spent per year on obesity medical costs alone. Look at all the salty snack foods. How many shelves and square feet of those? How about the beer wine and hard liquor you find in state stores and the half-proof liquors that grocery stores sell.  This is insanity. And our government and politicians support it. And THIS insanity has sprouted a new insanity. Covering every person in this country with MEDICAL INSURANCE. Washington DC,and every state capitol and county seat are the biggest,undesignated psychiatric wards on the planet. Not counting the countries and governments just as insane as ours is,whose footsteps we're following in and the ones who will later do what we are doing. The insane are running the asylum. And the population is too uninformed and too intelligent (too intelligent because most of us know we are reasonably intelligent;surely our elected officials must be more intelligent than we are,and we would NEVER do these insane things. I think that is our general mindset or world-view. And THAT is our big mistake...);so we are both too uninformed and too intelligent to comprehend the stupidity and insanity and the fraud on the systemic and massive scale,as it is,that is being perpetrated on the American population.

With politicians being bought and sold, being pro-corporate is very unpopular today with American voters. It spawned the Occupy Wall Street movement. Monsanto's aggressive seeds show unusual growth with significant, substantial, and now overwhelming differences to organic. How the seed ""magically"" appeared all over the planet is certainly no mystery to me. The poison Roundup is not bio-degradable and similar to plastic. It never goes away. Now it's in the soils and must be removed. Monsanto should be charged for this nullifying their billion dollar profits. Once sprayed, nothing else grows that isn't specifically GMO resistant to Roundup. Insects and infections are quicking adapting to the herbicide resulting in a much smaller yields than promised. Monsanto had a dream of world domination but has awakened to a nightmare creating a gigantic organic movement that won't stop until it completely engulfs Monsanto, itself. Their practices demonstrate a very bad business model in which others should take note. Even grocery chains are now carrying organic food and organic grocerys are packed with consumers. Manufacturers have now begun to fake labels revealed by independent food testing organizations. Nobody is safe right now.

3673923,5,B001KWB0L0,"When these seeds come home to roost - look out!  Among the countless pieces of absolutely crucial information Marie-Monique Robin has assembled for her masterpiece ""The World According to Monsanto,"" the single most crucial is the inevitable crash of Monsanto's devil spawn.  It's already starting to happen, beginning with their GMO cotton in India.  And I've read more recent articles which suggest Monsanto's other crops are beginning to succumb to parasites and weeds which they were not created to resist or which are developing an immunity to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.
In this connection, probably the second most crucial piece of information is at the end of the documentary and involves the nation of Paraguay, which borders Argentina - which had allowed Monsanto's GMO soybeans.  The seeds have been germinating so ubiquitously among Paraguay's soybean crops that they've nearly taken over and have driven the local farmers to the point of ruin - as well as virtually forced Paraguay to accept the GMO's.  In other words, if Monsanto can't get its foot through the front door, they'll simply sneak in through the back door.
Add to this Monsanto's efforts to genetically engineer even more staples of the human food chain and it's possible to extrapolate a nightmare scenario for our future - one that could bring humanity to the very brink of extinction.  Eventually Monsanto's monsters will very likely overtake the entire world and will destroy or incorporate all remaining natural crops.  The biggest problem is not that every living person on the planet may one day be at Monsanto's mercy - that's the least of our worries.  The greatest problem is that these crops, because of the present rudimentary state of biotechnology, have in effect a doomsday mechanism built into the seeds by the very method of gene splicing - a method almost certainly destined to create unsustainable crops over time. Which means that the only food available on planet earth will simply cease to exist as a foodstuff eventually.  And the human species goes extinct.",1359849600,5,2060,5.107142857142857

3673927,5,B001KWB0L0,"This is happening in the USA. In fact, Monsanto grew here because of the lack of government regulations, peer reviewed studies, pathways laid out at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by President Herbert Walker ""George"" Bush and Dan Quayle.

Herbert Walker ""George"" Bush visited the Monsanto lab during the Reagan Bush Administration and was taken in by the plans of this corporation to create seeds with organisms of a different species (new DNA) that would resist their best selling product, Roundup. But, Monsanto needed to be certain there were no ""unnecessary"" regulations  that would block their path.  (And, it was the plan for both the Reagan-Bush and the future Bush-Quayle Administration to de-regulate everything.)  As a result, the Monsanto former lobbyist, Michael Taylor (who is now Food Czar at the US FDA) worked with the Bush-Quayle Administration to devise a plan to regulate the development of genetic engineering BEFORE the seeds or products were released into the marketplace, but DE-REGULATE once they were released into the marketplace (when they should be regulated).

Working with Vice President Dan Quayle, Monsanto received everything they wanted in the new policy at the U.S. FDA, and that policy, posted in May, 1992, still stands in the decades since,  despite new studies to the contrary, which appear to be ignored by the FDA. The policy can be read at:[...]
This is an excellent video and I strongly recommend it to everyone interested in how our food and pharmaceuticals are created since coming into the marketplace in 1996, and the effort to control the world through the novelle new seeds --foods,  pharmaceuticals created during this brave new world of biotechnology.",1357171200,4,1709,5.192727272727272

This is an extremely well documented expose of the Monsanto company, how the people at this company are lying, misrepresenting, endangering our health and the health of everyone in the world - just to make a profit.  Talk about EVIL.  (This is the company that makes among other things ""Round Up"" Weed Killer - which kills all plants - unless they have been genetically modified to be resistant to Roundup.)

Farmers spray this stuff all over their crops, then we eat it.
And worse, the government is looking out for Monsanto's interests instead of the people's.  Don't just take my word for it.  See this video. Get it from your library if you can't afford to buy it.  Monsanto has been sued many times for false representation. (About how safe their products are)  Remember the additive they came up with to make cows produce more milk.  RBGH - Bovine Growth Hormone.  Monsanto lied about the results of the research, lied about it being safe for the cows and for human consumption, lied about all of it.  Did you know that in the research that was done, the cows that were injected with this had severe problems reproducing, and had severe problems with infected mammary glands (their breasts)(i.e. infected - and infection goes into the milk., etc).  The U.S. still sells lots of milk with this stuff in it - It was banned in Canada and other countries long ago...

Monsanto is also genetically engineering a lot of seeds, then putting a patent on them, then selling the seed to the farmers - the farmers are not allowed to keep any seed for themselves, and Monsanto regularly files suits against them if they even /think/ they are saving any seeds, or if a neighboring farmer ""turns them in"" and  they eventually cannot grow their own regular crops because everything has been invaded by Monsanto's engineered seeds.

The farmers also have to pay a royalty to Monsanto on all of their crops from seeds they purchased from Monsanto.  Cotton farmers in India are committing suicide in large numbers because they cannot afford to purchase seed from Monsanto. There are no ""regular"" cotton seeds to be found there anymore - just the genetically modified ones to be purchased from Monsanto. There are many, many interviews in the movie from people in governments, also regular people and farmers from all over the world - pictures of newspaper articles, google searches, etc to back this up - all done much better than I am explaining it here.

This story is far from new. Monsanto has been genetically modifying the agricultural world's seeds for decades. Don't fool yourself - when you see the majestic, sweeping shots of corn fields as part of an ADM (""Supermarket for the world"") advertisement, or idealistic images of Midwestern plains with shoots growing toward the sky, chances are that each seed in that soil was modified in a laboratory somewhere by this truly evil company that enforces their control over the American farmer like the mafioso with an informant.

Monsanto literally has a 1 800 number for whistle blowers to call. These whistle blowers are farmers ratting out their colleagues and friends caught saving seed for next year. The idea behind the genetic modification of crops like corn, soy and other vegetables and fruits is to ensure that they grow unusually (and unnaturally) large in a very short period of time, without the genetic possibility of returning to fruit and flower in the seasons to come (which goes against the very natural cycle of crops and growing things in the natural world).  That keeps Monsanto in control, and with the upper hand, over every person in the agricultural industry. Those who call as informants to the aforementioned 1 800 number basically are basically sending the message that there are individuals unwilling to comply with Monsanto's enforced growing practices.  A representative is sent to the ""non compliant"" farmer (as simple as a knock on the door) and with one small interaction, the agronomist in question can easily be put out of business in his industry for being subversive (i.e. not using non-regenerative, genetically modified seeds from Monsanto - in other words, not openly and readily supporting them as an active consumer for future transactions).  Farmers have committed suicide over the extortive and destructive tactics in which the company enforces and exerts their power over those who make their living selling their produce. It is no laughing matter.

What's more - Round Up (a Monsanto created product) has spread throughout the world as a common weed killer, on a global scale. The product has been used in indigenous populations, poor communities in the Deep South of the United States, and many other communities. Record levels of heavy metals and toxins have been detected in the land for which the product has been used, in addition to those who live either on the land or in close proximity of where the chemical spraying/treatments take place - ultimately causing cancer and other afflictions. Not only does Monsanto exploit the poor, but those who are under the false impression that spraying crops with this poison is harmless and even healthful. My stomach turned, watching the ad campaigns that Monsanto created to target indigenous communities (and even pregnant women and families) in Brazil. The advertisements maintained the claim that any spraying was harmless and did not cause any harm (including to dogs and women of child bearing years who might be expecting). We see deceptively malicious images of smiling women, children frolicking and dogs running free through the countryside - entirely in Portuguese.
It felt like the most deceptive and nauseating type of propaganda I have ever seen.

The interviews are engaging, the footage is infuriating and the structure of this film unfolds in a smooth and persuasive manner. The film smoothly progresses, with voice over of the author who initially wrote the book (Marie-Monique Robin), as she reports her findings to us, after her efforts to contact the parties responsible, as well as interviewing numerous folks in question who either did our agricultural industry dirty in the lowest (and most corrupt) form.  She also speaks, presents and reports information acquired from victims of Monsanto's shameless tactics to control populations, their food cultivation and consumption, as well as ruining their water supplies with dioxin rich run off (from routine land treatments, where cash crops are grown - on a global scale). This is especially an engaging method of conveying the overall message - not simply that Monsanto is evil and exerts a tremendous amount of control over our global community - but that we must be conscious consumers, even if we are kept in the dark about many of the company's unethical and destructive practices.

See this film. It is very important that we know what this company is trying to do, as far as monopolizing our food supply (you will want to buy organic and non genetically modified after watching this - trust me).  Though it is sobering, it gives you a fresh perspective as to how important it is to be as conscious as to where your food sources are situated and how they are being cultivated. If our bodies are our temples, we need to maintain appropriate guard keeping principles so we don't fall under the corruption of an industry that was once looked at as sacred.",1290643200,6,5497,5.017543859649122

3673949,5,B001KWB0L0,"Monsanto is a powerful force in this country and the world. Quietly they are working to OWN the food chain. This documentary is one that quite possibly will never be seen on mainstream corporate media in the USA. Monsanto started as a chemical company is the same one that told us DDT, Dioxin and agent Orange were good for us and they poisoned the world with it. Monsanto rather than lose ""one dollar of profit"" lied about the toxic affects of its products and exposed thousands upon thousands of US citizens to dioxin and condemned them to a slow and painful death. Monsanto was voted THE MOST UNETHICAL corporations in the world but somehow the USA government finds it expedient to fill important positions in the FDA with MONSANTO elite. Even the Supreme Court of the USA has a MONSANTO lawyer in it and his name is also linked to controversy - Clarence Thomas. Hilary Clinton also worked for MONSANTO. Now she is in a position which allows her to push GMO food production to the world.
I believe this documentary is on of the most important ones to come along and all must see. I also find it interesting that MONSANTO is Zionist based and pushes heavily for the use of Israeli biotech graduates to work in important positions in the USA over our own graduates. When you look at what crops are being touted as good choices for bio-fuel they are all MONSANTO products.

If you want a brief summary on how evil Monsanto is just watch Food Inc. Or simply Google Monsanto, just like the director of TWATM---Marie Robin-- does in this film. Over and over and over and over again.

A basic element of making an effective documentary is making it accessible and bearable to watch. Marie Robin fails to do this in every regard.  Her main concern seems to be inserting her face into the film through the dozens and dozens of absurdly repetitive, ""lady sitting at computer doing Google search followed by a quick zoom in on pixelated pictures and obtuse computer screen text for a split second"" scenes.  These scenes serve no purpose in communicating anything effectively to viewers. They simply annoy and eat up time that could be used to provide more information in a far more clear, organized and succinct manner.

Speaking of organized, this film is anything but. It jumps around haphazardly, with random scenes, articles and interviews connected only by the absurd ""director of the film sitting at computer Google-searching"" scenes. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I do not kid--this cheap and contrived device is used and abused by the director, literally, dozens and dozens of times in this film.

Yeah, Monsanto is an evil corporation. But if you want to communicate your message effectively, Marie Robin, make your film at least remotely accessible. And get rid of the effing robot narrator.",1272931200,29,1474,4.947368421052632

3673957,5,B001KWB0L0,"When I saw the cover of this movie I was convinced it would be the emotional rant of disgruntled hippies whining about vague health and environmental concerns.  The alarmist feel of the graphic on the cover definitely does not lend itself to a work of investigative vigor.  While there are moments when Marie Robin's conviction gets the better of her, on the whole she conducts a thorough and systematic investigation of a 60+ year saga that has defied objective journalism since the beginning of Monsanto's ascent in the ranks of private chemical engineering companies.  In 2004 Marie Robin received an award from the French Senate for her work documenting the French secret service's role in training their counterparts in dictatorial regimes in South America in the 1950s.  What makes her approach remarkable in The World According to Monsanto is her use of the google search engine to provide a historical narrative, combined with her unique access to interviews with the faces behind the documentation--documentation that is readily available, apparently, at the touch of a button.  While I think it odd for the French senate to give film awards, Marie Robin is well deserving--at least in this instance--of recognition.  She brings an air of legitimacy to an important subject.

3673963,5,B001KWB0L0,"The world is considered by Monsanto a playground to spread its poisonous chemicals to make money, without taking any responsibility for the consequences, pretending as long as possible that those are harmless, until all the evidence becomes so overwhelming it's impossible to continue denying it.  That is what they did with PCB's.  After 50 years of making money, they settled for a few bucks to pay for some of the damage to the survivors.  An internal memo revealed the company policy : ""We cannot afford to lose one dollar of business"".  On the other hand, the world certainly could afford to lose Monsanto.  It would be a better place.  Now, we have PCB's all around the place.  All of us - including you and me - have PCB's in our bodies.  Even polar bears have PCB's in their blood !

After producing other chemicals, like Agent Orange, Monsanto began focusing on genetic manipulated seeds in the 90's.  This would radically change farming.  Not to our benefit, but exclusively to the benefit of Monsanto.  Therefore, GM seeds only end up producing a lot of despair in farmers all around the world.  This video will take you to Mexico, Paraguay and India.  You will also see corn farmers in the US, not being able to save their seeds anymore, since their crops were cross-pollinated with Roundup Ready seeds from Monsanto.  Monsanto now disposes of a huge force of ""detectives"", checking American farm ground all over the nation, trespassing private property and stealing samples of the fields in order to check if those happen to include ""their patent"", and then oblige farmers to settle to pay for it.  In a just world, Monsanto would be prosecuted for gene pollution.  But that's not the world we live in.  We live in a world where corporate interests are considered by our ""democratic"" governments to be more important than human interests, justice and honesty.

Monsanto's aim is to monopolize the global seed production.  Seeds increase tremendously in price after Monsanto gets hold of a monopoly.  In India, where cotton seeds are all ""Roundup Ready"", cotton seed prices increased a whopping 400 % !  A lot of farmers can't cope with the debts they have to pay anymore.  On the one hand, seeds cost much more, but on the other hand, harvesting is totally at their own risk, and they have to cope with the dwindling prices for their crops, if they are lucky enough to have a good harvest.  Some of them get involved in a never-ending spiral of debt.  In this video, you will see an Indian cotton farmer, 25 years old - dead after suicide.  Every day, 2 to 3 Indian cotton farmers commit suicide.  That is the world according to Monsanto : a playground where farmers are exploited at the maximum, just to make more and more dollars.

It is also important to note that poisoning the fields with Roundup is very bad for the environment and for our health.  Roundup is an extremely dangerous pesticide, as confirmed by a specialist in this film.

This is the best documentary I saw on GM crops.  It has no happy ending, but in order to change the world, we first have to understand it.  There are ways out : buy organics, and support organic farmers close to you.  They need our support very, very much.

SECOND UPDATE : A landmark lawsuit filed on March 29 2011 in US federal court seeks to invalidate Monsanto's patents on genetically modified seeds and to prohibit the company from suing those whose crops become genetically contaminated.  The Public Patent Foundation filed suit on behalf of 270,000 people from sixty organic and sustainable businesses and trade associations, including thousands of certified-organic farmers. In Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association, et al. v. Monsanto, et al. (U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, Case No. 11 CIV 2163), PUBPAT details the invalidity of any patent that poisons people and the environment, and that is not useful to society, two hallmarks of US patent law.  ""As Justice Story wrote in 1817, to be patentable, an invention must not be 'injurious to the well being, good policy, or sound morals of society,'"" notes the complaint in its opening paragraphs, citing Lowell v. Lewis. The suit points to studies citing harm caused by Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, including human placental damage, lymphoma, myeloma, animal miscarriages, and other impacts on human health.  Plaintiffs condemn Monsanto for prohibiting independent research on its transgenic seeds and for its successful lobby efforts to ban GM food labeling. Many raise the specter of allergic reaction to GM foods, proof of which is hidden by lack of labeling.

The suit also confronts the propaganda that transgenic seeds improve yield and reduce pesticide use, citing reports on failure to yield and increased pesticide use. The complaint mentions a 2010 lawsuit by West Virginia after several studies contradicted yield results claimed in Monsanto's ads. And, it notes the growth in glyphosate-resistant superweeds.

""Thus, since the harm of transgenic seed is known, and the promises of transgenic seed's benefits are false, transgenic seed is not useful for society.""",1261612800,177,5421,5.088235294117647
