8486767,4,B005UBW4KS,"A deeply disturbing, very sad documentary in which no one comes out unscathed. In India a single mother from the slums is overwhelmed trying to raise the child in the midst of poverty and 'sells' him to a peddler. But the 3 year old boy is rescued (and legally adopted) by the owner of a local orphanage and Judo school. He notices the boy seems to have both a passion and ability for distance running, and so decides to train him with the hope of his one day winning the Olympics.

Sounds like the classic upbeat 'kid finds his way out of the slums' tale. But this film goes a direction we don't usually see with that kind of set up, and becomes something both shocking and Dickensian. What quickly becomes clear is that this very little boy is being driven beyond all sanity or safety, being used to live the dreams of adults. In come the authorities to 'rescue' the boy But it soon becomes very evident that their motives are no purer, and their plans for the boy may be far more damaging for him in the long term. The drama between the two adult sides grows ever more intense and complicated, while an overwhelmed and desperate to please little boy is trapped in the middle of selfish, angry, misguided and deluded grown ups

This is one of the more depressing films I've seen in a while. I found myself haunted by the story, unable to shake a vaguely sick feeling for quite some time. There is also something disquieting about the fact the film-makers just sat back and filmed all this. Could/should they have attempted to intervene? Are we complicit in the 'use' of this boy just by watching the film? Powerful if uncomfortable questions abound",1483833600,2,1650,4.51505016722408
