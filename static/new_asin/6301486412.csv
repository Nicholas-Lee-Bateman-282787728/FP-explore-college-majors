I am disheartened to only see the 'new and improved' version, which I saw and like no where near as much as the 1988 Canadian PBS series.  Out on a hunt to find it!!",1392940800,2,270,4.0754716981132075
7812396,5,6301486412,"I love this PBS series. Where is the DVD set? I first watched this with my kids, and was amazed by the realistic family dynamic they portrayed. Sarah Polley was wonderful as ""Ramona"". She never missed a moment and was so impressive as Ramona. Just really a born actress in the way she inhabited the role. I watched this over and over again throughout the years, and I would dearly love to see this as a DVD set to gift to young parents and families. Most rewarding and realistic family television, with the plus of good values. Thank you, Beverly Cleary for creating this character.",1383350400,3,582,4.552380952380952

7812398,5,6301486412,"I love the Ramona videos!!!!!!! They do an outstanding job of bringing the books to life. I doubt anybody could play the role of Ramona Quimby better than Sarah Polley. In this episode, ""Mystery Meat,"" Ramona and her older sister Beezus get stuck cooking dinner as a sort of punishment when they complain about having to eat the tongue that their mom makes. Fun video for all ages--and I mean ALL ages. If you love the books, there's pretty much no way you can dislike these videos.",1019779200,9,482,4.551724137931035
