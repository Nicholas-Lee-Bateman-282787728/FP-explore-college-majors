7899379,4,6305948356,"Perhaps Land Of The Lost's best-written episode opens Volume Four of the recent VHS series, and is followed by the debut of the Marshalls' most unusual foe.
In Circle, the swimming hole the Marshalls use for recreation leads to a back-door entrance to the Lost City, and when they explore the resulting caves, they are pursued by Sleestak but find refuge with the Altrusian scientist Enik, played perfectly by Walker Edmiston.
Enik has discovered a stunning fact about the Marshalls - the time doorway that brought them to the Land did not perform as it should have; the result is that the Marshalls should not even be alive.  All are at a loss to explain how they are alive when the doorway shows they should not be.  When Enik and Rick agree on a course of action, the doorway's paradox can be resolved.
From the show's second season, Rick and Will explore a mist-covered marsh, and discover an alien spacecraft.  Within is a woman who takes an immediate liking to Rick.  Indeed, the compatibility between Rick and the woman seems too good to be true, to the consternation of Will and Holly.",987033600,,1093,4.677083333333333
7899380,4,6305948356,"One of the more imaginitive and well written Saturday morning TV series of the 70s, Land of the Lost was one of the first TV shows to feature actors realistically interacting with what appears to be blue screen special  effects. In this regard it is a predecessor to such movies as Jurassic Park  and even the later Star Trek series. The stories involving a father who  appears to be a park ranger and his two children trapped in an artificially  created space time warp and how they coped with the unique problems that  entailed were generally very good. There were a few that were a bit over  the top but every series has those. I would highly recommend this series to  any science fiction fan, vintage TV buff and anyone who will look beyond  the fact that the special effects are not what we are used to and simply  enjoy the storyline. If you like Twilight Zone, you'll probably like this.",963360000,4,894,4.503105590062112
