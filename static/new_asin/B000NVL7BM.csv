8181892,5,B000NVL7BM,A baby Walrus is found alone and taken in by the folks at SeaWorld to raise and care for.  Nereus is very cute and his journey is a good one to watch.  The family with small children would enjoy his one.,1362614400,,203,3.926829268292683
8181893,5,B000NVL7BM,"This is one of my very favourite ""Growing Up"" series from Animal Planet! This video is also available as a collection called Growing Up Arctic- which includes three other videos.  Nereus is absolutely adorable and all kids and adults will simply fall in love with him.  A must-see video for anyone who loves animals!",1209340800,3,316,4.833333333333333
8181894,5,B000NVL7BM,"We were in Indy for the Patriots vs. Colts game on Nov 4.  We had extra time the next day before our flight left and went to the zoo.  We met Nerius at the Walrus exhibit.  What a ham he was.  He loved attention and kissed me through the glass.  We then found out that he was on ""growing up, Walrus"" so I looked and tried to buy it.  What a story he has and to know that he's alive and well and GROWING is amazing.  I recommend for all from 3 to 102.",1199664000,2,450,3.723404255319149
8181895,5,B000NVL7BM,"You wouldn't think of a Walrus as being that cute just to think about it, but this special ""Growing up Walrus"" was a hoot! I watch Animal planet all the time and wasn't sure how I would like this show, but as it turns out-this was the cutest special I'd ever seen! I made more noise and cooing over this little guy, then a group of sports fans at a play off game! Nereus is an orphaned walrus, who must be cared for in captivity as he as lost his mother. He always wants a hug and will snuggle up to his trainer at any given moment. I guarantee you will never meet a more lovable animal than Nereus, who is so lovable with his little bald head bobbing up and down in the pool! Highly recommend this special-anyone who sees it will have a new perspective on Walruses and fall in love with them!",1198108800,4,793,4.122580645161291
