1625078,5,B00005MEUW,"This box set contains the following: Robotech: Homecoming, Robotech: Battlefront and Robotech Extras Disc 2. Since the first two discs can be bought seperately, my review will be on the extra disc.
First, there is the usual extras on here: Animation sheets and International Clips. The Animation Sheets feature the mecha designs that are quite fun to look at. The International Clips feature two clips this time. One where Rico, Bron and Konda talk with the bridge bunnies and when Claudia  discovers Roy's injuries.
The new extras here are some neat ones. The most notable one being a 15 minute interview with Carl Macek done on a Dallas public access channel. Theres also a few scenes from Robotech The Movie in there too. The next big thing is the comic book gallery, featuring the entire Macross Saga issues. I have to admit that seeing Kyron hauling a sack of toys on Christmas was pretty funny. But not as funny as the Robotech toy commercials. Oh geez. These were so cheesy, you'll burst out in laughter. Especially when they show the play set commerical where they say ""Oh no. Bretai's on the ship. Use the trap door"". Too funny. The character Bios are pretty informative and nice to read. A worthy extra. And finally, the two minute Galaxy of Stars video featuring Robotech at a toy convention. Theres even some people there dressed up as Rick and Minmei. You only get to hear one kid say ""its great"" at the end of it. Pretty good extra.
And the episodes are even better. So buy this right away! You won't regret it.
Note: In episode 24, one of the games at the arcade is actually a Lupin 3 video game. You can find it easily.",997142400,2,1635,4.580204778156997
1625079,5,B00005MEUW,"For anyone who waited for the TV show to unfold this SAGA is a Must Have. As a long time fan of Robotech, I am glad to know that this great work ( for the time it was made ) is finally being made available again. Not only that but in the DVD format with all the extra's and goodies we have come to expect from this new format. This Second Boxed edition is great. Not only did they put a nicely packaged Box-Set together, they added a bonus disk that Iced the cake and made up my mind in a heartbeat. The only drawback is that like the previous Boxed-Set there is not a whole lot to it. The Gloval report is OK, but the interview with Carl was [bad]. Had i seen it when it aired i would have called and complained to the TV Station. Knowing how many of us were in the DFW area at the time we shoulda complained, but is a little late now. Hope you enjoy it.  I am now patiently waiting on the Third Boxed-Set.",996969600,,907,3.9562841530054644
1625080,5,B00005MEUW,"Hi there, after 16 Years I finally have it back. From the good old day's when Kabel TV came to Germany for the first time, it also brougth us Robotech ! And now I have the first Box Volume in my Hands and can't wait to get the next one! The features on it are few but cool. And Digital Work on the Animation cells went very well. To all Robotech Fans out there. If you don't own a DVD Player yet make sure you get one fast !!!

1625081,5,B00005MEUW,"After reviewing my last reviews of the earlier robotech, I came to the conclusion that this IS Robotech. There are the 2 versions, the original japanese Macross, and the North American dub which are totally unrelated. Yes, the price is great, but that just makes up for the poor quality of the DVD. We all can benefit because of the great price. On the other hand, there's the Japanese original version that will be totally remastered and have great quality from AnimeIGO. You lose the quality of the North American dub....but you win with the price. You win with the AnimeIGO version and the quality, but it's the subtitled Japanese version.
In short, for the people who have never seen this show before, it's what really started the Japanimation craze in North America.  Robotech the Macross saga has the romance, drama, and tragedy that any great show has, and this 3 pack is no exception.  It features the death of a main character, defections of the enemy from one side to the other, budding romances between fellow officers, and enemies, and that's just the beginning!
This 3 pack, with the inclusion of the bonus cd, regardless of the dvd picture quality, is a great set to get.  I highly recommend it to all, including the dubbed Japanese version which again, is different.
You win either way.  Enjoy them both.",994982400,,1319,4.746724890829694
1625082,4,B00005MEUW,"Its one of the sadests moments in the Macross saga when Roy dies, I saw it in some reruns of the show.  Its a most have for every robotech fan",993772800,,142,3.7333333333333334
1625083,5,B00005MEUW,"On 1985 a cartoon series came up which changed the life of many people, including myself. So many things happened that were a first for a cartoon, the plot was amazing and the characters more real than many life series. Robotech set a precedent for future Japanese anime. Gundam, and other famous stories were developed thanks to the new concepts introduced in Robotech. Finally, after a long time we once more have the chance to watch this incredible adventure. In this particular release you will not only get the known episodes but also extras that come on a third DVD, which all fans will enjoy for sure. I already bought the first DVD boxed set and I can't wait for the second!
If you ever saw Robotech or like Japanese anime, then this is a MUST!!",993686400,4,753,4.544117647058823
1625084,5,B00005MEUW,"After the first 3 DVDs released, here comes the second trio and guys, these are really cool! Robotech as you already know, changed a lot the way we all see japanese animation and in some cases made a huge impact in our lives as kids. Don't miss this oportunity to own the complete series.",993686400,3,288,4.351851851851852
1625141,4,B00005MEUW,"Although I'm glad ROBOTECH is available on the digital format- with 6 shows per disc, no less!- I'm somewhat disappointed by the picture quality. Sadly, it's only a slight improvement over the old VHS tapes I used to own. The sound's not too much better, either. But, at least there's some improvement. And if given the proper care, I'll never have to worry about the picture & sound quality degrading on the DVD format like I did with the VHS counterparts. So there's some good news, anyway.
Another disappointment I have is the fact that the Robotech DVDs aren't in 'Perfect Collection' format, where the viewer can watch both the American-release eppie and its original unedited Japanese (w/ English subtitles) counterpart. You know, a little something for both the hard-core Robotech nut and the Macross/anime purist. Sadly, this ain't likely to happen in the near future- the Macross series (which was re-made into the first part of Robotech) is getting its own separate DVD release. Looks like I'll have to clear off some more space on my video shelf...
Anyway, this particular set includes Volumes 3 & 4 (shows 13 through 24) of ""Robotech: The Macross Saga"" (lots more death & destruction, and the loss of a couple of the series' beloved stalwarts), and an extra features disc that's exclusive to this set. Probably the most interesting bit on this extras platter is a 15-minute interview with producer/writer Carl Macek on a Dallas-area community-access show. Although the clip is somewhat bland, Macek does discuss the other then-upcoming Robotech projects that never really took off, including the Sentinels series and rarely-seen Robotech Movie, which saw only a limited release in the Dallas- Fort Worth area before it pretty much disappeared from the scene. In fact, a few scenes from the movie are shown here, and are likely the only parts of the ill-fated flick that'll ever see the light of day in a legitimate commercial recording. BTW it's probably just as well anyway; I've seen the entire Robotech Movie on bootleg video. It's a pretty sad sight to say the least...
Also featured are brief character bios & animation model sketches of various mecha & equipment seen in the Macross segment. Unfortunately, these extras weren't too new to me, since most of the bios & sketches are also available in the Robotech Art 1 book. But, since Robotech Art 1 is a rare book, and thus very hard to track down, these particular bits are likely to be brand-spankin'-new to the average 'Techie. Then there's the featurette that takes you behind-the-scenes at the 1986 Robotech Galaxy of the Stars convention, complete with droves of geekin' fanboys, autograph booths, toys, buttons, posters, & other swag, and... Malcolm Jamal-Warner? What's he doing there, and why does he have his own autograph table? Was it part of a plot to cross over ROBOTECH with 'The Cosby Show'? Methinks a sinister conspiracy is afoot...
Like the previous box set extra features platter, this set's disc includes clips from the show dubbed in different languages. I find these parts kinda painful to look at. It's mainly due to the fact that the voice actors doing the foreign dubs tend to sound better than the English ones! Better emoting, inflections, the whole nine yards- especially the French & Portuguese voice-overs! I'm glad to see some folks still take pride in their work. Too bad it's in languages I only partially understand!
Finally, there's the wide array of Robotech toy ads- action figures, vehicles, die-cast toys, playsets, and fashion dolls! All done in that trademark loud, pumped-up 80s hype-it-to-death style that got many a spoiled brat to annoy the 'rents to buy, buy, buy! And you thought Transformers & G.I. Joe toy commercials were obnoxious!

1625142,4,B00005MEUW,"This is a good follow up to the first box set, but I was dissappointed with the extra DVD. The only thing interesting was the 15 minute interview with Carl Macek. That was the highlight of the extra DVD. It also showed a Robotech convention with a bunch of crazy Robotech fans and what looked like Malcolm Jamal Warner. What does he have to do with Robotech? The episodes themselves, well, this part of the series (episodes 13-24) are the ""depressing"" part of the storyline, where we see the deaths of Roy Fokker and Ben Dixon, along with the earth banning the SDF-1. A great story, though, and as I just purchased the third set, I can not wait to see it again after all these years.",1003881600,2,683,4.3858267716535435
1625143,5,B00005MEUW,"as i wrote about the first collection, this is simply excellent. i hope all get a chance to watch this great show. i'm glad that they did the DVDs the way they did them. i love watching them over and over.",1001548800,2,205,4.024390243902439
1625144,5,B00005MEUW,This was a great series.  I think Robotech was one of the best cartoons ever created. This is a very good buy.,1001030400,2,110,4.0
1625145,4,B00005MEUW,"For those of us who grew up on Robotech, it is a blessing to finally be able to purchase the entire series on DVD.  This saga takes all of the elements of great sci-fi storytelling and rolls them into a animated series far better (in my opinion) than Mr. Rodenberry and Mr. Lucas.
(By the way, just for the record: ROBOTECH IS NOT THE SAME AS MACROSS. In the past few years, there has been a lot of interest in Super Dimensional Fortress Macross. Let's be clear, Macross is ONE of the original Japanese cartoons on which Robotech is based. They are not the same. Macross is a great story in and of itself, but it is the material upon which the ""Macross Saga"" {Generation One, first 36 episodes, etc} of Robotech is based.)
This second DVD in the series focuses on my favorite part of the story. In this set, we witness the loss of two main characters and the reactions of our heroes to those losses. We also see the growing love triangle between three main characters. (I don't want to give it away for those who are not familiar with the story.)
Finally, the only drawback to the set is with the ""extra"" DVD. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth the money, but I expected a few more ""extras"" on the extra DVD. My guess is that while Mr. Macek and others are trying to make the purchase of the boxed sets appealing, they're probably trying to stretch out the extra goodies for later extra DVDs; hence the four star rating and not five. Others have complained about the quality of the DVDs and the fact that it's not really Dolby Digital and I admit it would have been nice to have the episodes remastered, but (as someone said) that requires a huge budget, and personally if they had all that money, how about finishing the Sentinels.
If you're looking for a great animated story (that not just for children), it doesn't get any better than Robotech. ""Long Live Minmei!"" -God's Best",999820800,,1882,4.4393063583815024
1625146,5,B00005MEUW,"The Robotech Legacy: Macross Saga Collection 2, a three disc collection, contains episodes 13 through 24 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s. The first two discs contain six episodes each. The third disc contains all the ""Exclusive DVD features"" and is only available if you purchase this boxed set. Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s. Known for its cutting edge animation, thrilling battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture. Set in the 21st century, Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three seasons. The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed after a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth. The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come. As the story unfolds mankind would go on to battle three separate alien races over the next three seasons. The sweeping intergalactic saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a deeper ""human"" saga. This volume chronicles the ""meat"" of the adventures from the first season - The Macross
Saga. In this volume the story is off at full steam with TONS of INTENSE ACTION and intense loss as the enemy attacks relentlessly. Also at full speed is the equally intense soap opera love triangle between Rick, Lisa, Minmei and Kyle. Here's a listing of what you'll find on these discs.
Disc 1 - Homecoming, episodes 13 -18. Episode 13 - Bluewind: It's a race against time as the Zentraedi renegade Khyron renews his attack. Can they make it back to earth before Khyron destroys them?

Comic Book Cover Gallery: 36 comic book covers from Comico's adaptation of the 36 episodes of the Macross Saga. Cool stuff!!!
4. Animation Production Sheets: Drawings of the mecha. COOL stuff!!! 5. Character Bios for theMacross Saga. Very informative. Great background info. 6. Point of View with Carl Macek: Fifteen minute interview with Robotech producer Carl Macek done on a talk show back in the 80s. A Must Listen!!! 7. More International Clips. Listen to both the scene where the SD-F1 ""bridge babes"" metup with the Zentraedi spies and where Roy Fokker passed away in either French, Portuguese, Spanish or Italian. VERY cool stuff!!! I am personally very happy that ADV and Harmony Gold have finally released this series on DVD. This is BY FAR one of THE BEST cartoon/anime series from the 80s or the best ever PERIOD!!! If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST. The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture hit. It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US. If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again. They're great for a trip down memory lane. I can honestly say that they are better than I remember. You can't lose!!! Give this (and all other current and future releases) a watch. You won't be disappointed. If you are planning on purchasing, pick up the Boxed Set. It's the only way you'll get the Elements of Robotechnology Disc. Alone, the individual volumes DO NOT come with DVD extras.

This was the 'soap opera' of cartoons, addicting people to tune in religiously each day. A great series.... But as far the the DVD goes.... the DVD quality is no better than when I watched in on TV as a kid. Nothing was done to improve the original quality. Oh well, it is still an awsome series.... if a little more work had been put into the DVD I would have given it a 5..... hell, they didn't even edit out the part before and after the commercials.... ""You are commanded to stay tuned for Robotech"".... ""Robotech is back now""...... you would think they could have just cut out that part and spiced the episode together....",997401600,,738,4.4338235294117645
1625150,2,B00005MEUW,"As a long-time fan of the Robotech genre and the author of a modestly popular Robotech novel...I have to scratch my head, yet again, regarding this latest release of Robotech on DVD. Despite nearly twenty years of technological advancement these DVDs are no better than the VHS tapes released by Palladium Books in the late 1980s and vastly inferior to the Laserdiscs incompletely released by FHE in the mid-1990s. The sound has not improved, nor has the footage, which looks old. Contrast this with the Animego ""Macross"" DVD project which includes digital restoration of both print and audio and one begins to wonder if Robotech's copyright owners are just after a quick buck on their way toward burying Robotech for good. (Indeed, everything with Robotech's license from toys to videos to books, with the exception of Tom Bateman's ""Robotech: Perfect Collection Soundtrack"" has been sorely lacking.)
Carl Macek took three unrelated Japanese television shows and managed to change the dialogue enough to link them all together. In the process he unwittingly created a marvelous piece of storytelling. Though the characters sometimes contradict themselves in words and action (a result of the rushed nature of the Robotech project's production) it is a truly wonderful thing, the first--and probably last--epic of its kind.
Though the quality is extremely poor given the technology available, I plan to purchase the entire set and recommend it to anyone who has in his heart affection for this show, especially those who do not have the series in another medium. Despite its shortcomings, this is the most convenient format to date for viewing the Robotech Saga--and may very well be the last, so get it while you can. For those who have not seen it, take a look...you will be pleasantly surprised with what you find.",997228800,,1817,5.080267558528428

7945361,3,B00005MEUW,"Robotech: The Macross Saga - Legacy Collection 2 is a three-disc DVD box set that was released in 2001 by ADV Films.  The first disc contains the episodes: ""Blue Wind,"" ""Gloval's Report,"" ""Homecoming,"" ""Battle Cry,"" ""Phantasm,"" and ""Farewell, Big Brother.""  The second disc contains the episodes: ""Bursting Point,"" ""Paradise Lost,"" ""A New Dawn,"" ""Battle Hymn,"" ""Reckless,"" and ""Showdown.""

The third DVD in the set is labeled as ""Extra Macross Saga 2 - Elements of Robotechnology.""  This DVD contains all of the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is ""Galaxy of Stars,"" which is made up of excerpts from a promotional video produced by Harmony Gold to document the original launch of the Robotech toyline that was held in New York City during ToyFair 1986.  This extra runs for about a minute-and-a-half.

Next are the commercials for the toys.  The first page in this section is devoted to the commercials for the boys' toys (figures and vehicles), and the second page is devoted to the girls' toys (dolls and playsets).

The next feature is labeled as ""Character Bios.""  The first page lets you choose from the ""good guys"" (Roy Fokker, Claudia Grant, Lisa Hayes, Rick Hunter, Ben Dixon, Minmei, Max Sterling, and Captain Henry Gloval).  The second page lets you choose from the Zentraedi: Khyron, Exedore, Breetai, Azonia, Miriya, and Dolza.

In ""International Clips,"" you can choose to watch one of two clips in several different languages.  The first clip is when Kim, Sammie, and Vanessa run into Rico, Bron, and Konda after they've stolen a Minmei doll.  The second scene is when Roy Fokker talks to Claudia Grant for the last time before his death.  You can choose to watch these scenes in English, French, Spanish, Portugese, or Italian.

There are also ""Animation Model Sheets,"" which consist of 49 pages of mecha that appear in the series.  You can also take a look at ""Macross Comic Covers,"" which is 36 pages of front covers for the Macross comic books.

The final extra is ""Point of View.""  This is a roughly 15-minute long interview with Carl Macek on a local access program from Dallas, Texas.  During the clip he talks about the Robotech series and the then-forthcoming Robotech: The Movie.  What really struck me about this interview was how Carl Macek tried dancing around the fact that Robotech originated in Japan.  It was never blatantly said that Harmomy Gold had acquired three different shows from Japan, and how they worked to put them together into one series.  Macek was willing to say the animation was done in Japan, but it was phrased in such a way that someone who didn't know would think that Harmony Gold had asked a Japanese company to animate their story.

Overall, this is a decent DVD box set.  Even though I wish ADV Films had gone to more effort to remaster the video for the release, I would still recommend this box set.  However, it is now out of print.  If you are a fan of Robotech and happen to stumble upon a used copy of this DVD set, I would recommend picking it up.",1229385600,,3038,4.759082217973232
