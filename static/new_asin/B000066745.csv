Billy really brings down the house.

8191208,3,B000066745,"I was lucky enough to witness this concert 2 years ago, and it's more than odd that this DVD only has 77 mins., that's too short for a 5 hour concert. The cuts made on artists like Baaba Mal or Lisa Roxane are a shame. I remember Beverly Knight playing an amazing acoustic sing which unfortunately is not here, nor is the whole set by The Corrs or REM which could've made this DVD more appealing. They also edited Mandela's speech, in a clear sign of disrespect. My advice: if you have gone to the concert buy it, it will bring nice memories despite all the cuts, if you haven't look elsewhere.",1070064000,6,594,4.3125
