8755027,5,B01D5MQPW6,"This is just going to be a quick, short review; I have my full review on MyAnimeList @ [...] if you'd like to read it.

Basically, there's one thing that WIXOSS excels in over other series' that try to do the same thing: it's a complete deconstruction of such a fickle genre that rarely goes beyond the boundaries that it set for itself many, many years ago. That genre is the card-game subgenre.

Other anime that try to do the same thing, such as Madoka Magica, have obvious flaws behind their series compositions in that they only deconstruct certain ASPECTS of the genre. They end up keeping most of the same tropes and use them in ways that aren't deconstructive at all, while only going beyond the norm of the genre for certain tropes. Plus, those types of anime end up reverting back to normal in the end, not keeping their path of deconstruction going and returning to safety as a sort of cop-out, instead of attempting to write something good to keep the series on its own path that it, itself, created all the way until the end. That's hard to do, but WIXOSS also does it quite well, granted it's not 100% finished yet but so far, nothing's been reverted back to normal as things normally are. And I doubt they will be, if we're being honest here.

Overall, that one thing is what makes WIXOSS such a great anime, better than others of its kind and incredible regardless of that fact. It IS very confusing at times, and the second season especially can be EXTREMELY hard to understand at times. But, if you're able to put in some brainpower to understand all of it, you will be mind blown and will end up loving the series as much as I did.

And yes, the second season is better than the first. The first is still great as well, but the first mostly sets the stage for the second season, and end up being a lot like the anime I described above; just a deconstruction of certain aspects of the card-game subgenre. The second season continues the legacy and creates a deconstruction that's absolutely perfect at what it needed to be, which is what makes it better than the first season.

Of course, these aren't the only reasons why the second season is better than the first, and these aren't even CLOSE to the only reasons why Selector Spread WIXOSS, and the WIXOSS series as a whole, are both so good. Those are explained in my full review that I linked above. Regardless, if you're looking for a good deconstruction anime to pick up, WIXOSS is virtually the greatest recommendation you can get from me, so I recommend you go with it.
