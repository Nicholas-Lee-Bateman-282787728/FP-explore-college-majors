8605970,5,6304506945,"I received the DVD of this movie for Christmas and had no idea what to expect.  I have never seem any thing like it and probably never will.

It is a crazy mock sexual documentary made in 1971.  If this movie came out today it would be a shocker with the topics they explore.  The movie is laugh out loud funny.  The middles does drawn out a bit and some parts are less funny but it is a must see for a comedy fan.  I was speechless after watching it being amazed what I had just seen.  5 stars.
