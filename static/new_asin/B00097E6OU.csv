Why do you believe, ""Because I hallucinated and saw Jesus die on the cross, and I felt bad.""
It's produced like your day to day made-for-tv after-school special, so not horrible production and acting.",1510272000,,374,4.9523809523809526

Jesus IS coming back and there will be a day when we are held accountable for every idle word and deed, he sees ALL, at home and when we are just ""hanging out"" will you hang your head in shame? or will you hear ""well done my good and faithful servant""? Have a BLESSED day",1242777600,3,373,3.986666666666667
8058138,5,B00097E6OU,"""What is the most important thing in life? What is the most important thing in life? That's the question Jason Reynolds and his classmates are assigned as a topic for speech class. But when Jason watches his best friend fight a life and death battle with leukemia, the question becomes far more than an academic endeavor. This powerful video dramatically presents the good news of the gospel in the context of the love that sent Christ to the cross. As Jason comes to grips with the realities of life and the consequences of sin, viewers are challenged to answer for themselves the question of life's ultimate priority. An excellent program for outreach events, for evangelistic invitations in your youth group or in homes, or to inspire believers to share their faith.

Every youth director needs this film in their ministry tool box. Honored as the best evangelistic film of the decade, it clearly convicts teenagers of their need for Christ. It also motivates them to share their faith with others, and reminds us all of Christ's deep love.

The Crossing has impacted tens of thousands of teenagers through salvation or rededication to Christ. Whether shown at a camp, large event, retreat, lock in or within a teenager's living room, The Crossing will bring the power of God's forgiveness into the heart of all who see it.""",1190419200,2,1327,4.867256637168142
