3943776,5,B002KQ6PII,"This is a wonderful DVD that I am eager to share with friends and family.  Clara is a delightful, feisty and kind personality whose kitchen is a joy to visit.  I love the stories she tells about life during the depression while adeptly cooking up her recipes.  The meals are so basic that they will seem almost exotic to modern palates, but they exemplify making the most of what you have and appreciating it.  Every episode left me with a smile and a desire to do a better job in all areas of my life.",1260662400,25,502,4.252631578947368

3943778,5,B002KQ6PII,She's fabulous and her grandson has done a phenominal job of filming capturing the essence of Italian  life during the depression.
