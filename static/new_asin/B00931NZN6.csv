I don't recall seeing this subject even addressed, much less to this level of ambiguity, on film anywhere. A rare meditation on guilt and atonement which I'd assumed had been ""empowered"" right off the face of the planet. Kudos to a brilliant director and cast (and to Korea), this will be around for a long long time.",1449187200,,436,4.75
