4645724,5,B005BSCPY0,as a teenager with a passion for history I am always fascinated with talking to veterans. This documentary gave me the ability to see what they saw this is truly a remarkable flim,1321056000,21,179,4.454545454545454
4645725,4,B005BSCPY0,"The personal accounts of the Vietnam Vets are second to none.  As one who fought in A Shau in '68 I marveled then modeled the fighting attitude of protecting their brothers from courageous battles to clearing a LZ.  The insane policy of taking a hill then leaving hurt morale let alone the deaths and casualties.  My criticism of this documentary was the way it handled the impetus to the actual invasion:  Bay of Tonkin.  It was rigged from the get go.  My lasting impression was how drafted young men would  sacrifice, fight, and die half a world away will live with me for the rest of my life.  Hopefully Americans will too.",1320969600,22,627,4.535714285714286
4645726,5,B005BSCPY0,"One of my ex-co-workers called me to tell me to watch ""Vietnam In HD"" on the History Channel. He and I are both retired police officers and befriended each other just by mere chance. Since I've always been intrigued by this particular war since the draft was done away with while I was a senior in high school, I'd questioned him since he's an ex-Vietnam veteran and had told me he'd been at Hamburger Hill. I'd always had this guilt that I'd chosen school over the war back then. Since he's an awesome buddy of mine, he and I have shared his stories about this ugly war. It's ashame that they weren't supported by the majority of the Americans here. He's cried with me and I feel proud and honored to have shared his experiences over there. Even though he's 10 years older than me, he and I are like brothers.

After having said that, I'd noticed ""Vietnam In HD"" had 4-6 different stories. Naming them: (1)An Endless War (1978), (2) A Changing War(1964-1965); Peace With Honor (1971-1975), (3) The Beginning (1964-1965); Search & Destroy (1966-1967), (4) The Tet Offensive (1968); An Endless War (1968-1969), (5) The Beginning (1964), and (6) The Tet Offensive (1968). I didn't know if #3 and #4 were the same as #5 and #6. I see that you sell ""Vietnam In HD"" but have no idea if the DVD/Blu-Ray broadcasts all the stories. I want to buy the whole series but am not sure if I should if it doesn't have all of them. I wish you'd let your customers know. I want to buy the blu-ray version and give one to him as a gift for his donation to the war and our country for the veteran's day weekend. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.",1320883200,3,1638,4.441860465116279
4645727,5,B005BSCPY0,"I've watched the first 2 hours in HD on History Channel and loved it, but why isn't the Blu-Ray DVD sold here in wide-screen aspect ratio instead of 1.33:1???

4645748,5,B005BSCPY0,I bought this as a present for my husband. Both of us wanted to hear an unbiased and complete story on the Vietnam War and events that surrounded it.

4645753,4,B005BSCPY0,I can say the documentary is good.  Used to see some of this on TV really gives you a sense of what the US was going at the time and really a turbulent decade of the years of  the Vietnam War really is no WWII that's for sure.,1508371200,,226,3.6875
4645754,5,B005BSCPY0,"I thought the HISTORY CHANNEL did a wonderful job on this documentary in HD. I learned quite a bit from it from our beginnings there to the end of America's part, which was Jan. 1973 with the departure of the American Combat forces from Vietnam.
Now, with that said, how long did you really think the South Vietnamese were going to hold out against the North Vietcong? When President Nixon had to resign as President because of the Watergate scandal, that basically told the North Vietnamese that all bets were off and that any agreement that Nixon and them had was null and void. So, the invasion of the South began.
What I wanted to see more of in this documentary was in the last episode. It was not as detailed as it could have been.
 I wanted to see more of the AIR campaign we had going as well. BUT, this is beautifully done for what they have on it. Highly recommended~

To basically get more details on the time between Jan. 1973 and the Fall of SAIGON in April 1975, I had to see ""THE LAST DAYS OF VIETNAM"". Which, is done by American Experience. THAT is exceptional, so check that out as well. VERY informative!",1507334400,,1122,4.389423076923077

4645790,2,B005BSCPY0,"This just wasn't what I was looking for, I guess.

I was looking for a documentary that would give me an in-depth record of the Vietnam War, its causes, the various strategies and campaigns, etc. Instead, what this is, is a series of personal accounts by people who lived through the era and soldiers who saw combat. The documentary does a pretty decent job of showing you what it was like to experience the events and witness the horrors of war, but it only at best gives you a very brief and superficial overview of what's behind the carnage you're witnessing. I guess maybe if you want to be artsy about it, you could say it's something of a statement that the causes didn't really matter and there's no meaning to be found in such suffering, but personally I was looking for more hard facts and a more objective view than what this documentary has to offer. It's well done, but ultimately it reduces a pivotal moment in world history to tragic melodrama, which is a shame.",1481673600,,976,4.5141242937853105

4645849,3,B005BSCPY0,"I was perplexed as to why, whenever I've visited the U.S. and I asked people how many died in Vietnam, a depressing amount put the figure in the tens of thousands. It's actually closer to 1.5 million if you count the Vietnamese. I couldn't fathom why so many people in such a wonderful country should have such an insular view of the world. Seeing this helped explain why.

A responsible documentary will cover all sides of the experience. I recently saw a documentary about My Lai, where they interviewed survivors, perpetrators and everyone else involved. It enabled me to understand why it happened and actually to sympathize with all parties. The scope of this six-parter felt very narrow by comparison.

Navy, Air Force, other nationals? You don't hear from them. ARVN veterans? NVA or VC veterans? Not in a million years. Agent Orange? Not mentioned. Atrocities? No. Gulf of Tonkin? Nope. Folk on the receiving end of Napalm? Long term environmental damage? Birth defects? Nothing to see here. In fact there's not a single interview with a single Vietnamese in nearly five hours of footage. Maybe you don't care what it was like for them, in which case, this is the documentary for you.

On the plus side, the experiences of US army veterans and their families are very much worth hearing, as are the experiences of all veterans. After what they went through, the least we can do is listen to their stories. But theirs are not the only stories.",1439596800,2,1450,4.768924302788845

Interviews with the journalist and the soldiers that were there. They pull no punches, straight talk from the gut. Actual battle scenes show soldiers doing routine maintenance, waiting for something to happen and then suddenly explosive violent combat. Just like the old saying about combat, ""long boring patrols interjected with moments of sheer terror"". This country owes a lot to the soldiers that fought in Vietnam. They trotted through mud, swamps, monsoon rains, the heat/humidity, mosquitos that carry malaria, leeches, poisonous snakes, little sleep, long patrols. And then to top that off, mines, booby traps and gun fire. They did their job knowing that they might not live another day. They were very brave men.

""Vietnam in HD"" starts with 1964. The USA went to war to kill commies. That's just about as much history as you get. The rest is war footage. The lack of history prior to 1964 was disappointing to me.

Unlike ""WWII in HD"", the footage in ""Vietnam in HD"" was produced more like a movie than a documentary. It seemed like its purpose was more to entertain than to educate. This was also disappointing to me.

At the end of the Battle of Inchon episode, they described that battle as a triumph and huge success for USA forces. Really? That screamed propaganda to me. That was about 50 minutes into DVD #1. Based on the footage and narration, it was not a huge success.

Things I liked about this DVD:
* veteran interviews
* lots of war footage (mostly in color)
* narrator
* well organized (by year)

Things I did NOT like about this DVD:
* Lack of history
* The music was too much like a military recruiting video.
* Produced like a movie, not a documentary
* For the most part, they used young voice actors for recounting war events (they should have used the veterans).

The point of this DVD is to show color footage of the war. Don't expect a thorough historical documentary.

The one telltale phrase that stuck with me went something like this: The Vietnamese have been battling foreign invaders for over 1000 years.

If you want to learn about Vietnam before/during/after (i.e., some real history about the country and the war), then I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vietnam-A-Television-History/dp/B0001WTWOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vietnam - A Television History</a>.

The interviews are fairly well done and somewhat sequential, but they jump around a great deal. I was sort of expecting more from the History Channel. I would recommend this as a solid addition to any Vietnam collection, but don't expect any stunning revelations or personally moving recounting of events of a soldier in the war. One of the reasons that I can't/won't talk about my time there is that it brings back too much of a feeling of loss and only aggravates the PTSD. The loss in the lost youth, the lost friends, the lost innocence and the loss of faith in the leadership of our country and the loss of the US public to at least care when we came home. The PTSD in that when you think about the few people that you let into your guarded psyche and then lost them with either horrible deaths or even worse wounding, and the other events that shook you to your mental core that the person you thought you were could actually do some of these things, these bring back those horrors that invade your mind and feed on your mental stability 24/7.

Our military wins up being the biggest pawns in a battle of two pairs and the war over freedom of the press.

4646084,3,B005BSCPY0,"The series is done extremely well about what happened ""in-country"" and how ill-prepared and lack of leadership and control we were given.  The series still raises some of the bitterness we felt coming home from the protesters.  They carried signs ""bring our GI's home"" yet when we came home, they scorned and turned backs to us, screamed obscenities, beat our cars, and threw things at us.  We were the Soldiers, Marines, and Sailors not the Politicians who refused to allow the military to operate a military action.  The series focuses solely on ""in-country"" action.  If you are interested in Army/Marine this is excellent coverage.  There is no comment about the Navy or Air Force, the reactivation of the USS New Jersey to lend support, nor the Carriers providing air cover and the rearmaments at sea.  Yes, it's clearly how we felt being there and hopefully some who burned draft cards and flags will understand our side as well.

For those who were too young to remember or who were not alive at the time this serves as a stark reminder of the costs of War, both in human terms and treasury.",1363305600,,422,4.2875
4646102,2,B005BSCPY0,"The viewer is introduced early to persons whom the war impacted - soldiers, wives of soldiers, journalists and more, and these person provide commentary throughout the nearly 5 hour series. These persons are depicted (interviewed/filmed) free and comfortable in, invariably, beautiful homes. Moreover the impression is cultivated that every one of these persons are normal, average Americans who could easily be  neighbors we would be delighted to have. They are depicted as having entered the war as patriotic Americans, babes-in-the-woods, who slowly discover that, like Dorothy, they ""aren't in Kansas anymore"". Their ideals crumble, their faith in America and/or her leadership and institutions begins to waver.

As you enter the bowels of the third disc the filmmaker slowly unveils that many of the characters who have been narrating the story for you, are in fact, anti-war radicals, including veterans who marched on the U.S. Capital in company with now Secretary of State John Kerry, who famously accused the veterans he served with with all manner of atrocity; who was exposed by his fellow Swift Boat veterans as having been a conniving, self-serving solider with crass political ambitions even while serving in combat. Another narrator is one of the founders of the organization that gave us the infamous black & white POW/MIA flag (her husband had been missing in action and then POW), so, a great deal is made of this POW/MIA issue. However, in this hack of a documentary I never saw or heard the perspective offered that in WWII, in the United States armed forces, 78,750 missing in action were reported by the conclusion of the war, representing over 19 percent of the total 405,399 killed in the conflict, while in Vietnam 2,255 were unaccounted for, less than 4 percent of the total 58,152 U.S. service members killed. This Vietnam percentage of missing in action is, by far, the smallest proportion in the U.S. history.

Typical of media produced that lambastes America's involvement in Vietnam is I saw not a single interview with any of the people we were fighting to defend, or with the South Vietnamese soldiers we fought with and who suffered casualties that make ours look like chump change. Oh, you'll see footage in this documentary of civilians we accidently killed but you won't find a single interview with a South Vietnamese civilian on the street, who were by and large terrified that the Americans would one day leave their country. You'll learn that in combat the North Vietnamese allegedly ""owned the night"", but no where in this DVD does anyone explain that one reason the South Vietnamese lacked strong and courageous leadership on the battlefield (and in politics) is that the North Vietnamese routinely murdered and assassinated South Vietnamese who displayed leadership.

I made mention of the freedom and comfortable homes enjoyed by the war protesters  featured in this documentary, but of course this DVD makes no attempt to catalog on film the squalor in which many Vietnamese now live, or the freedom all Vietnamese have been deprived of. Surely no one in Vietnam is at liberty to make a DVD series like this one, at least not without government censorship.",1361404800,14,3202,5.079847908745247

Our direct involvement in the murder of President Diem and his brother and so many other pertinent facts are totally missing. This was a war that should not have happened and the cost to us, the Vietnamese, the Cambodians, etc. is outrageous. There are books available like ""Fire in the Lake""and ""The Embers of War"" that provide a much better coverage. If only Oliver Stone will release his new (Showtime) ""Untold History of the US"" videos; there would be a much better alternative to these films. Watching these films just makes me sad and angry; at almost 70, I lived through this bizarre time with 1968 being the penultimate year. Watching a hill being taken at a terrible cost to my generations young men and then given back by default is too much to bear. My low score is because you are being told a very biased point of view and so much of the history and truth of the war is not told.

I watched the whole thing and I have to say I am impressed at all the footage they collected. There are also a core people (13 in total) they interview that was serving giving us a real account of what they did and been through. In all, it was a great documentary that did a great outline of the war.

They really got into detail of certain events that I rarely hear about, such as the US troops attacking the NVA in cambodia, the air cav operation to support ARVN, specific protests on the home front and the eventual take over after US troops leave.

The only drawback of this is that it wasn't as long as I hoped it was. I think they eventually ran out of footage.

I recommended this product if you want to learn more about the Vietnam War. There is a lot of great footage. We also get to learn about the stories we don't always hear about in the media. The live accounts give you a new perspective to the war as well.",1333497600,2,1071,4.189320388349515

The now out of print documentary VHS ""Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War"" was my first exposure to the war in the form of a documentary (released in 1980). that documentary went into great detail by interviewing CIA agents, generals, and politicians involved in the war.

4646193,5,B005BSCPY0,"I just viewed this documentary in its entirety and all I can say it is awesome!  Do not listen to the naysayers who critisize the documentary!  It is very moving and touching, even dramatic in parts and is very powerful! I loved the ""surprise ending"" involving the POW but I won't say more to ruin it for those who have not seen it!  Also, what I thoroughly enjoyed was the fact that it was historically accurate and surprisingly objective and ideologically neutral-it was not gung ho right wing pro war propoganda of the type you see on Fox but it was not left wing ""all the American troops were baby killers"" thus warranting them getting spit on by the protestors when they returned home, which tragically and sadly happened!  There is a lot of combat coverage and action which illustrated how the war was indeed brutal and hard fought for American troops against a tenacious nationalist/""communist""  insurgency and the more formidable North Vietnamese Army which waged a convential war in South Vietnam to support the Viet Cong insurgents.  Basically America was fighting a determined, tenacious enemy that was willing to sustain massive losses (which they did) waging a guerrilla war to reunify south Vietnam to the north. My only concern is that the documentary did not give sufficient enough attention to the political context of the war, only a rudimentary explanation which was enough for me, but that is because I have taken numerous courses on the Vietnam war in both the undergraduate and graduate level in college.  Someone with limited political/historical knowledge might therefore not learn the context and background of the conflict and might want to read a good book on the topic or perhpas watch PBS's excellent series on the Vietnam war, which is from a somewhat liberal perspective and therefore a little more critical (but not condemning of the U.S. troops either).
Anyway, a great documentary with a lot of feeling, my only regret is that my dad, who served in Vietnam, did not live long enough to see this documentary, he would have enjoyed it!  The documentary also makes references to Mel Gibson's excellent movie ""We were soldiers"" as well as ""Hamburger Hill""  which showed the brutality of the war and how bravely the soldiers fought in adverse circumstances against a determined foe in an inhospitable jungle in southeast Asia.

The video gave me a real understanding that there was no real game plan on how they intended on fighting this war which wasn't fair to our soldiers and at the end the war really ended up a waste of time, lives and money.

What he wasn't able to put into words before, he now can explain. Our whole family has been educated not only about the war, but about what was happening in every aspect during this time, i.e. what was happening in the states, in our government, in their government etc. It is just very well done and honors those who served their country during a time of riots and the explosion of television and its coverage of the war.

I saw it on the History Channel, so I bought this for my 21 year old son who just joined the Army. I am now half way through watching WWII in HD which is also fanatastic!

4646225,5,B005BSCPY0,At long last a vivid first-hand account of this unpopular war comes to the masses.  Many of us were either too young or not even born yet when these American boys went to a far away country in South East Asia to fight for what their country believed in.,1324944000,,253,4.163265306122449
4646226,1,B005BSCPY0,"The series starts out strong with some vivid images and compelling stories that bring back strong personal memories of the early years of the Vietnam War. We really thought that once the U.S. military arrived in force it would be over within a year or so. I was in the fifth grade in 1965. Seven years later, in 1972, I was graduating from high school and facing the prospect of being drafted to fight in what appeared to be a never ending war.

I was impressed with the early episodes of this series, but it goes down hill beginning with episode 3. First, though the producers come up with some very good images of the war, they did not do their research very well. They show images of US Army infantrymen in combat while telling a story concerning the Marines on the DMZ. There are many examples of the film not matching the story being told. Second, by episode 3 they are starting to repeat the same film images over and over again. Third, there is virtually no mention of the other Free World allies that supported our war effort - the Australians, New Zealanders, South Korean, Thai, the Philipino soldiers who fought side by side with us. Unlike today's ""Coalition of the Willing"" in Afghanistan and Iraq, these Allies stayed with us to the very end in 1972 and did more than their fair share of the fighting. However, you would not know that watching this series. And finally, while the series emphasizes that we propped up an corrupt regime in Saigon, it seldom mentions that the ARVN did a majority of the fighting and dying in that war.

The one compelling segment of this series centers on the 1968 Tet Offensive and the reaction of the Johnson Administration. It recounts the reaction of the Administration, their weighing the costs of escalation and total mobilization of the US military in reaction to the offensive and other ongoing crisis around the world. And more importantly, how the American Public began to turn against the war.

The last episode glosses over the last significant acts of the war - Lam Son 719 invasion into Laos in 1971, the Easter Offensive of 1972 and more importantly, the Linebacker raids of December 1972. The series talks about the North Vietnamese going back to the peace talks in early 1973 without explaining why. Instead, the series degenerates into individual stories of veterans and citizens turning against the war and their government.

This series follows a trend in movies, books and the popular culture that promotes an American centric view of our history, especially our military history. This trend has prompted us to rename past wars with politically correct titles, leaves the public with the impression that only the US fought in World War II and that Vietnam was a ""civil war"" that became an ""American"" War. Never mind that our intentions were to stop the spread of Communism in the middle of a very heated ""Cold War"".

I cannot, in good conscious, recommend this series. There is too much shoddy research and poor editing to make this series worth while. Unfortunately, there are no series that presents an impartial and accurate view of the War in Indochina. Most of what's out there promotes a stereotypical, biased view that has come to be accepted by the public who is beginning to forget what it was really like during those years - both over there and here in the states.",1324771200,182,3341,4.714041095890411

4646251,5,B005BSCPY0,"Having served two tours of duty with the ""Brown Water Navy"" in Vietnam, the 1st in '65-'66 and the 2nd in '68, I was disappointed at the lack of information about the US Navy's contribution throughout the conflict. That being said, the two BD set contains the best explanation of the war I have viewed to date. Without taking sides it explains the controversy which grew to surround the conflict itself, the confusion of those who waited at home, and the turmoil faced upon their return, by those who were told to leave their homes to fight it.

Unlike other ""explanations"" of the war which I have watched over the years, not one minute is wasted on useless information, glorification or controversy. Vietnam in HD tells the story of why those of us who fought it did what we did, and those who watched the war on TV at home, did what they did.

The BD set is worth every minute of time invested in watching it, whether you are a Vietnam Veteran, the family of a VN Vet or a member of the generations who followed. If you are one who cares, buy it and give it a watch; you will be glad you did.",1323648000,13,1094,4.305825242718447

For anyone who is interested in real footage,not some Hollywood buttered version,I highly suggest this DVD.Let us never forget all those 58,272 names on the Wall for their ultimate sacrifice for a nation at the time that was ungrateful and in many ways still is. Never again will a generation of veterans abandon another. Welcome home all Vietnam vets.",1323216000,12,541,4.76595744680851
4646253,1,B005BSCPY0,"The men who served in that war deserve better and so does anyone who is going to view this type of material.  In the first 5 minutes it is extremely apparent that this mini series in very slighted in it's perspective, which is really almost criminal almost 50 years later.  The program runs over the gulf on Tolkien incident, which we know now is extremely suspect and controversial and also there is no mention of French colonialism regarding the division Vietnam which is really important information.  This program is really disappointing, in fact it is almost a rip off of Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam which is a really striking narrative of what the American Personnel in Vietnam were going through.  I also think the narration in this program done by actors really cheapens it since they have the voice actors basically reading the lines for eye witness who are available to recount things on their own.

People are entitled to their own opinions but not there own facts and this program avoids facts and putting the war in any real historical context.  The soldiers who went over there got a raw deal from the military, their government, and sadly from many American's who couldn't separate an unpopular war from the soldiers who suffered worse than anyone.  This mini-series is not comprehensive, has a definite agenda that ignores facts, and is totally inadequate which is just sad at this point.",1323129600,29,1416,4.850622406639004
4646254,4,B005BSCPY0,I would have given this five stars if it did not have the actors reading the veterans script and fading back and forth between the actors and the actual veterans. The veterans were perfectly able to speak for themselves. I also considered it an insult in the intro when they place the actors names in larger print than the actual veterans. That said over all it is a good presentation of the war given that 6 hours for a ten year war will leave out a lot. I'm glad that they at least mentioned the horrible reception we veterans got when we returned home. For decades it was best to not let anyone know that you had served in that war.,1322870400,9,635,4.256198347107438
4646255,5,B005BSCPY0,"Vietnam is my generation's war. It is hard to comprehend the young kids shooting the video presented in this DVD are now, like me, in their sixties. This DVD is not an in depth study of the war. It does not get into the reasons why this country became both mired in it, and torn apart by it. The Gulf of Tonkin is mentioned as the first step toward increasing  U.S. involvement, but it does not discuss the controversy regarding legitimacy of the Tonkin incident. It doesn't mention Mai Lai, nor does it spend a lot of time discussing the reasons why the American public turned against the war. It is not meant to. This is the recollections of the young Americans who were on the ground, a nurse who served there and a P.O.W.'s wife. It does a great job of describing all the different hard fought engagements with the NVA, and the horror of it all. Many who went to Vietnam were volunteers,but many were draftees with no say in the matter. These young men served without caring about the politics of the time. They went, did what they were told to do, and just tried to stay alive. All Vietnam Vets who served risked their lives, and should be honored for the sacrifices they made. Some just wanted to survive and get home. Others returned home to join those speaking out against U.S. involvement. All were patriotic Americans, and hearing their personal stories put a human face on this war. For those who were interested in this DVD and/or the history of the Vietnam War, I recommend the exceptional PBS Documentary, ""Two Days in October"". Remembering my friend, John. Deployed in August of 1967, and killed in Kontum Province, March of 1968. 19 years old.",1322697600,88,1659,4.567114093959732
4646256,4,B005BSCPY0,"I appreciate the great lengths that the History Channel went through to collect and compile all of the video footage that went into this product, but buyers should be aware that there is a very American-centric perspective that focuses heavily on conventional ground forces.

Despite the development of counterinsurgency doctrine, there is little mention of the Green Berets conducting village stability operations or even acknowledgement of the Montagnard forces which fought alongside the American troops.

The Vietnamese perspective is completely absent, from both the north and south.  I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Vietnam-s-Unseen-War-Pictures-from-the-Other-Side/dp/B0000640VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic - Vietnam's Unseen War - Pictures from the Other Side</a>&nbsp;for those interested in filling this gap.

I would also point out that while this conflict was fought primarily between American and Vietnamese forces, it is also the most controversial Australian military expedition in their history - but this is completely ignored in the series.

This is a well put together series with a lot of great footage, but don't expect to find a definitive historical reference to the Vietnam conflict.",1321401600,13,1307,6.488505747126437
