Andrews Blu-ray Review: When watching the Walt Disney animated film TREASURE PLANET today, its hard to believe the animated cartoon has just reached its 15th anniversary and not because it feels new, but rather quite the opposite. While THREASURE PLANET is enjoyable to watch, it plays like a product of the 1990s. With dated computer graphics, artistic style, and soundtrack, the films release to Blu-ray entertains but reminds audiences why it never became another Walt Disney classic, but despite this, I really enjoyed its adventurous attitude.

TREASURE PLANET is based loosely on Robert Louis Stevensons novel Treasure Island, and spun into a sci-fi world of the future with space pirates, aliens, laser guns, and automatons. With legendary Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements at the helm, this film appeared to be a way for them to take animation beyond the worlds of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID, and be appealing more to a male audience.

But while the adventure of the film is often exciting, there is little character connection. Though the motivations behind most of the characters actions is simple seeking a long-lost treasure and only a handful have enough development for audiences to care about them. But the animated film often makes up for its relatively simple story with a unique visual style, a seamless blend of traditional hand-drawn and computer-generated animation, even if the CGI appears to be of an era further back than its fifteen year age appearance.

Also slightly dating the animated films tremendous song Im Still Here, supplied by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls. Hearing the singing voices instantly took me back to the 1990s as it was prominently featured in the middle of the animated film. This one song is a far cry from the brilliant musical numbers featured in so many of Walt Disneys animated films.

It has been fifteen years since I had last seen the animated cartoon TREASURE PLANET, when it first arrived in the cinema. Before watching the new Blu-ray home release last night, all I really remembered about the animated film was something about an obnoxious robot ruining its third act. And sure enough, an over-the-top hyperactive robot voiced by Martin Short entered the picture right on cue, far too late for a new character to be introduced, especially one that ultimately proved to be fairly useless to the story.

But this time around, I looked past that unnecessary character to the grander picture of the animated film, able to enjoy it not as an instant classic, but instead this is a fun adventure through outer space and I don't even want to admit to a direct reference to the unfortunate and totally obnoxious film Pirates of the Caribbean. It may not be perfect, far from John Musker and Ron Clements best work, and perhaps not worthy of its 2002 Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film, but it is at least enjoyable romp around the cosmic universe.

With reaching its 15th anniversary milestone, TREASURE PLANET, has been given some sprucing up for this Blu-ray UK release. The animated film itself looks terrific and sounds even better, but sadly no new bonus features are added for this release, including, taking viewers behind-the-scenes into the making of each element of the movie. But sadly they are all presented in standard definition and are recycled from previous inferior DVD releases. But Walt Disney fans shouldnt immediately shrug off TREASURE PLANET, especially as it was directed by two of Walt Disneys best and while it may not hold up to the standards set by so many other timeless Walt Disney musicals, its an adventure that is well worth viewing, and best viewed on this new Blu-ray UK release.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios presents this Blu-ray in a totally awesome 1080p encoded image presentation. The 1.66:1 aspect ratio HD image looks downright amazing.  There was the slightest bit of banding in the opening shot, but aside from that and a couple of other instances here and there, its an astonishing transfer.  Colors are bright and bold, detail is exquisite and the entire film seems to have nearly presented us with a 3D effect, but sadly not being shown in 3D.  Weve all become so used to the computer animated films looking so good that when you go back and watch a 2D film, its nice to have it look nearly as good.  For those that have never seen TREASURE PLANET and it looks totally amazing.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios presents this Blu-ray in an amazing new 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix, more than does the job. Every sound seems to resonate with the utmost clarity.  Dialogue is, of course, crisp and clean and even the pirate speak sounds great. The brilliant surround sounds are heard often, adding some terrific atmosphere to an already very active soundtrack. Like the video presentation, this audio mix is second to none and will give your speakers a good workout.

Finally, with this 15th anniversary milestone of this 2015 remastered Blu-ray release of TREASURE PLANET has been given little more than a sprucing up for this UK Blu-ray release. The film itself looks and sounds brilliant, but sadly no new bonus features are added for this UK Blu-ray release. But sadly there is nothing to shout home about, except taking viewers behind-the-scenes into the making of each element of the animated film. Disney fans shouldnt immediately shrug off TREASURE PLANET, because it was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, which is by two of Walt Disneys best and while it may not hold up to the standards set by so many timeless musicals, its an adventure that is well worth seeing, and best viewed on this new 2015 Blu-ray UK release. But sadly there is no upgrade on the extras and they are only presented in standard definition and are of course have been recycled from previous inferior DVD release, but despite this, I am so pleased to add this to my ever increasing Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!
