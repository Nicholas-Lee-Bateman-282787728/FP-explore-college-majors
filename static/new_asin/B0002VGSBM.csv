2126786,5,B0002VGSBM,"Outstanding plot/story line, combined with excellence in prosthetics/make-up, costuming and puppetry!
The only fault with series' as well-done as this lies with the network execs who decide to cancel them in the first place!",1469577600,,224,5.617647058823529
2126787,4,B0002VGSBM,"Loved every episode. And also found out the ""Predator's"" allowed the Scarans men to borrow the their battle helmets:)",1469232000,,117,5.2105263157894735
2126788,5,B0002VGSBM,"Loved this show back in 2000 when it first came out on SciFi network, even if some of the episodes are a bit cheesy and poorly written. Missed numerous episodes due to what seemed like flaky broadcast schedules (the show seemed to disappear from SciFi for weeks at a time and then would randomly reappear, and I missed season 3+ entirely). Gives me a chance to catch up with what I missed, and the show doesn't seem dated at all, despite being 15 years old now (hard to believe its been that long!)",1462406400,,498,4.365591397849462

2126817,5,B0002VGSBM,"Farscape is an incredibly well done series. The Characters grew with the show and the show should never have stopped being made.
It had very Creative story lines, great characters, prosthetics, costumes, special effects, and all the actors seemed perfect for their parts so the casting people were right on. May have been difficult to make and direct but that team made it work!

Always a pleasure to see the relationships in the show grow and change. Always a privilege to see Claudia Black and Ben Browder together. Great ""acting"" chemistry between them.",1429056000,,556,4.978494623655914

2126837,3,B0002VGSBM,"Disappointing ending episode for the fans who had watched faithfully for 4 seasons.  Why do they do that?  They said to be continued, and then they just canceled the show ending it with a cliff hanger.  Not fair to the fans.",1426636800,,224,4.414634146341464

2126877,5,B0002VGSBM,"Love the Farscape series!  Wish there would be a new movie...I heard there was one being worked on but it has been YEARS!  I am losing hope.  This is a great sci fi series and the final 4th season wrapped up a lot of the story lines, but also left a lot open.  You need to see the Peacekeeper wars movie to see what happens!",1425081600,,324,3.9384615384615387

2126881,4,B0002VGSBM,Farscape was always one of my most favorite science fiction series. I hate that they cancelled the series. I miss all of the characters. The only problem I had was the ending and then there was no sequel. Not a great way to end the series....It would be great to pick up where they left off and continue the story. Think of what can be done now with the special effects!,1424822400,,370,4.225352112676056

2126898,5,B0002VGSBM,"Loved this series from day 1. The series end was a heart breaker but then the movie Peacekeeper War's put the frosting on the cake.
A very well written series with a multitude of alien worlds and creatures of almost every type imaginable. And when it comes to bad guy's
Farscape had some of the worst (or Best ) there are. All in all this is a must have for any Sci-Fi enthusiast who wants to add a science fiction icon to their collection.",1424390400,,440,4.25

2126905,5,B0002VGSBM,"I watched all the seasons available. At first I didn't really like it. The initial premise didn't grab me, the main actor seemed a bit juvenile, and I wasn't sure what to think of the puppets. But I kept watching and it grew on me until I found myself watching multiple episodes many days in a row. The plot became less juvenile, the characters became more interesting, and I forgot I was watching puppets. For me, it is one of those quirky shows that you end up loving or hating. I ended up watching the series twice. I want to know what happens next.",1421625600,,552,4.3173076923076925

2126934,4,B0002VGSBM,"Season 4 is another solid season, not as charming as Seasons 1 & 2 which roped you into being a diehard fan but still entertaining. One of the High points is the allusion to the beginnings of an oncoming all out war between Peace Keepers and the Scarran Empire.",1417910400,,261,4.346938775510204
2126935,4,B0002VGSBM,"Engrossing series with a lineup of wonderfully weird, funny, appalling, endearing, horrifying, disgusting characters such as this world has never seen before, onscreen or off.  There is much humor, and there are deadly serious situations.  I heartily recommend it.",1417824000,,264,5.743589743589744

2126948,5,B0002VGSBM,"Fantastic series! I got completely sucked into it. The characters were engaging and the stories riveting. The only thing that wasn't so great was the mini-series, that tied up all the loose ends of the show wasn't available on amazon. I had to search for it and watch it on directtv. Still, the series was great. Now that I've watched them all, Im going to miss watching the show. I'll have to find another series.",1417392000,,414,4.533333333333333

2126952,5,B0002VGSBM,"One of the most criminally underrated sci-fi shows ever, this season really ratchets up the intensity by finally putting Moya's crew on Crichton's homeworld and bringing the Hunt for John's knowledge (from both the peace-keepers and the scarrans) to a whole new level.  It also solidifies the relationship between John and Scorpius and John and Aeryn as one of the best antagonistic and best romantic relationships (respectively) ever portrayed.",1416787200,,445,5.449275362318841

2126960,2,B0002VGSBM,"I love sci-fi. Never could get into this show, though. It's like Muppets In Space crossed with Lost In Space. Where to begin? The limited budget shows in every aspect, including the slack writing, so that nearly every episode for four seasons involves some sort of set-up before the opening credits -- with the screechy, incredibly annoying theme song -- and then the characters running around and around the chintzy sets for the rest of the hour. The Muppety creatures are impossible to take seriously if you're mentally over the age of eight. The main character is a dopey jock who looks and acts like he should be on a college football team, not an interstellar team. Most of the other characters are dopey or annoying too. Yes, Claudia Black is a strikingly handsome woman and does quite nicely as the requisite space hottie, but she's not enough to save it. Because I love sci-fi I have tried repeatedly over the years to find some way of liking this show, but it never works.",1414368000,,981,4.64367816091954

2126976,3,B0002VGSBM,You can tell when a series is going down-hill as they start to emphasize sex over good writing.  Season 4 is a good example of that.  Some of the episodes of season 4 are ok but overall it is average to marginal,1410652800,,211,4.0
2126977,4,B0002VGSBM,Much more drama. Special effects are great.,1410480000,,43,5.285714285714286
2126978,5,B0002VGSBM,The story continues. There are some real goofy episodes that break the tension. The best is the Chuck Jones tribute where Dargo and John play out a Roadrunner type cartoon.,1410393600,,172,4.766666666666667

2127003,2,B0002VGSBM,I liked the first season but each following season got more and more absurd and cartoonish. Also the lead character became obnoxious and Implausible - as did the story-lines. Season three was over-the-top so the fourth season's first episode was as far as I could stomach the series.,1409356800,,283,4.916666666666667

2127018,4,B0002VGSBM,"There are few shows out there as inventive and wild as ""Farscape"" and it continues to carve out its unique niche with this fourth season. Ben Browder continues his commanding performance as the human John Crichton, lost in the depths of space among aliens. His growth over the course of the show has been stellar, and that development doesn't slow down here. Aeryn, played by Claudia Black, also has some really meaty stuff to work with and is given some interesting directions. The rest of the returning characters are pretty much as they've always been (with some minor tweaking or highlights here or there,) but John and Aeryn have always been the heart of the show and where the most change/growth is.

The new character of Sikozu is an interesting addition to the crew, and she brings back that sense of ""can she really be counted on?"" that many of the characters had early on but lost over time as they all bonded. Grayza being promoted to the big villain on the Peacekeeper side is functional, but she's unremarkable as a villain. Thankfully Scorpius is still around to keep things lively, and his shifting role in all of this always adds a nice edge to things.

On an episode by episode basis the quality varies quite a bit. When the episodes factor in some way into the larger story of the season then they tend to work quite well. The more stand alone episodes feel like the filler that they are. The problem with these episodes is that they've become very formulaic, with the crew making a deal with the wrong person (or something along those lines) and then having to work their way out of the issues that ensue. By contrast the episodes that feed into the larger overall story are much less predictable and yield some truly stellar moments.",1405036800,,1753,4.633440514469453

Now I will give a HUGE BOO to AMAZON. PEACEKEEPER WARS. You guys couldn't put that into the system? That's what wraps up the whole series and gives the ending true meaning. Please add the PEACEKEEPER wars into the system.

Sadly not four seasons later the series was canceled, sending shockwaves throughout the fan base. It was a sad day for all us geeks. However throughout the years since, it has gained an even greater following and still continues to inspire and amaze thanks to streaming media like amazon Prime.

wormhole technology viewed as a must have for the Peacekeepers to even the odds and Crichton, by implication, being

2127078,3,B0002VGSBM,"The plot writing really turns disagreeable starting with episode 5.  After the events in season 3, it was an internal struggle to accept the direction the show took this season. *SPOILERS*  The who's the baby's daddy storyline was completely ridiculous to accept, especially after the powerful relationship John and Aeryn had in season 3. I know they explained how it was possible, but it just didn't work for me. Why did the writers do this? Am I watching Jerry Springer? Also, they made Aeryn cold and distant, worse than season 1, for more than half of this season.  Aeryn was one of my favorites, but the writers really dragged her character through the mud this season. The relationship between John and Aeryn takes two steps back to the point where they are trying to figure out if they should be together (season 2 anyone?). At one point Aeryn says I did everything I could to keep us together Huh...did you forget that you left last season(wtf writers).  Bringing Scorpius on board just didn't work for me either.  Him and Sikozu had terrible chemistry with the rest of the crew. Their crew group scenes were hard to watch because they just didn't fit in, it felt forced almost.  And finally, are we really going to rehash the peacekeepers chasing Crichton for wormhole technology storyline again; should have been done after season 3, okay. The cliffhanger to this season was a motherload!

The Good: The season started off okay until episode 5. I thought Noranti's quirkiness meshed well with the rest of the group. I liked her over Stark, Jool, and especially Sikozu.  D'argo, Rygel, and Chiana were more comfortable in their roles and played their characters very well. Season 3 and season 4 you can tell they act more natural giving to the illusion of realism.  Rygel had some great one liners throughout the season and started to be more of a team player which I enjoyed.  The ""kansas"" episode was the best one this season, in my opinion, it was because Aeryn was acting normal (not the bitch in previous episodes this season) and the whole crew was back together working as a team without Scorpius and Sikozu. The chemistry of the original characters plus Noranti works well together and I think that's why this episode is particularly good.

Overall, I really felt the writers dropped the ball this season. The crew had a chance to be free and travel to each others home worlds (even Chiana mentions it) and resolve those story lines.  They did not, but decided to rehash the peacekeepers chasing Crichton storyline again.  The wormhole storyline was overcooked at this point.

It's certainly NOT like other more well-known series such as Star Trek Voyager or Babylon 5. It's less glitzy and just darker. So I haven't bothered to watch this particular Volume yet and don't know if I ever will. If this series wasn't in my collection I wouldn't miss it.,1389052800,,410,4.48

2127143,5,B0002VGSBM,Outstanding show because it's a fabulous series that has many stories untold. I just hope that someone someday would consider a episodes five(5).,1387497600,,145,5.3478260869565215
2127144,5,B0002VGSBM,As a sci-fi pop culture show it is fun escapism that simply entertains. The chemistry of the cast works very well.,1387152000,,114,4.476190476190476
2127145,5,B0002VGSBM,"I use to watch this when it first came out. It still is good but since all the new sci fi stuff has been coming out it lowered the viewing periods for me.
I give it 5 stars still cause the program is just awesome.
Ill always like this show. Its great. I don't watch it much anymore but when I do i like every episode.",1386979200,,317,3.8181818181818183
2127146,5,B0002VGSBM,I am a sci fi junkie and have totally enjoyed watching this series. Maybe someday we will get more Farscape,1386979200,,107,4.4

2127148,5,B0002VGSBM,This show really took Sci Fi to an epic level. The motivations and depth of the characters equal the variety and depth of a world where space travel is common place and inter-species relationships really matter. The tech is used not only to impress but to drive internal character development and it is done well. Very creative! And muppets.,1386892800,,341,4.796610169491525
2127149,5,B0002VGSBM,"the final season of the first TV series that I ever spent my money on collecting also one of the most expensive serious at the time due to how new DVDs where at the time the series cancellation newer sets became cheaper and I think the full set now is much much cheaper I'm not sure if the newer set has the same quality of encoding though or sound I thought I saw it on blue Ray for a few months but it seems to have disappeared are never come to pass.

Series was one of the first of its kind if not a one-of-a-kind series my sister relates it to a role-playing game character group on quests and fighting off or dealing with the things that come in between completing the quests.

To me the show was the perfect progression from those years of Hercules and Xena and Stargate SG-1 and the ending of the Star Trek TV years but it has gone a direction that I have never seen in any sci-fi sense the characters didn't grow season by season or stay stagnant they grew even in the episode they changed and an episode they acted how you'd expect everyday people to act when faced with the trials adventures and torturers that happen in the show with the boundaries of keeping it a family show I guess the makeup scenery were beyond anything I've ever seen in its originality and comforting Farscape is a place I always want to go back to and unlike BattleStar Galactica the reimagining series it's something that's easily gotten back into if an episode is on here are their when flipping through channels. The ships may not be as cool as Star Trek or Star Wars but once you've seen the whole show they start to make sense and once you see the insides in the later years you will forgive them for not looking like any of the current styles of spaceship used in television or movies. Maybe also a key point to the series was even when somebody was in charge nobody was really in charge the characters just did what they would do any ways which is probably how is most people experience there every day lives with other people around them",1386547200,,2031,4.31413612565445

I found it way back in 2002 when it was in its 3rd season and was only able to watch about 75% of that season before moving and no longer having access.  Imagine then how thrilled I was to find it available to me...all FOUR seasons for FREE via my Amazon Prime account!  WOO HOO, I love me some Farscape!",1385078400,,339,3.9558823529411766

Great to see each episode in order this go around. Really is a shame that they did not continue after season 4. Purchased ""Peacekeeper Wars"" to finish the series.",1384041600,,302,4.826923076923077
2127157,5,B0002VGSBM,This is truely one of the best sci-fi shows ever made there are alot of great ones that were made but none of them gave such a personal side to the crew even the puppets are so life like they have they own personality.why you can tell the show was such a great one is when it was cancelled there was such a outcry that the follow up movie hade to be made,1383696000,,354,3.863013698630137
2127158,5,B0002VGSBM,One of the most entertaining shows to watch. Very well done. You have to watch over and over to catch all the inside jokes and references.,1383696000,,138,4.346153846153846

2127161,4,B0002VGSBM,"Certainly not the best TV show in the universe, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had watched the first season or two in high school and finally got around to watching the whole thing. It has aged fairly well and the acting is above average for a science fiction TV show.",1383091200,,268,4.2745098039215685
2127162,3,B0002VGSBM,Seems the budget for props was cut as most of the season seemed to be filmed in the dark. Story lines suffered greatly.,1382227200,,119,4.217391304347826
2127163,5,B0002VGSBM,"Arguably, the climax of Season 4 was not, in fact, the unlocking of Crichton's wormhole knowledge and his subsequent destruction of Earth's wormhole, but rather the seemingly ill-fated relationship between John and Aeryn. The chemistry of this cast is exemplified in Browder and Black's subtle interactions, which contribute to the larger mechanisms of this season's story arc. If anything, I was more concerned with ""Are they going to get through this together?"" than with ""Is Crichton going to unlock wormhole knowledge?"" without realizing that the two questions were interconnected.

In any case, those are the philosophical questions that ran through my mind through this entire series, and although the ending to this season isn't the neat and tidy conclusion I was expecting when I first watched some 8 years ago, it's beautiful in its simplicity and universality. It also paves the way for Peacekeeper War, which doesn't get nearly the attention that it deserves. But that review's for another day.",1381968000,,1005,5.28125
2127164,5,B0002VGSBM,"It was the best show when it was on TV, and it is greatly missed. I wish the whole team would get back for a reunion so we can see what they have been up to lately.  Make a new movie about all of they please, we need they back in our life.",1381795200,,239,3.509433962264151

2127172,5,B0002VGSBM,"The show was a strange combination of aliens, humans, and wonderful Frank Oz puppet creatures.  The show just worked so well and was from Australia why some of the starts aren't really known in America.  The two leading stars went on to do the last years of Stargate SG1 which was a very nice surprise.  Don't forget to watch the last show that sums up the ending in The Peacekeeper Wars.",1378944000,,388,4.436619718309859

Seems to have a great value system.",1378339200,,165,5.875

Although there were a couple episodes where the cast played each other - funny indeed.  Again, too bad the series ended when it did. Definitely could have gone another few years.",1377734400,,310,4.7924528301886795
2127178,4,B0002VGSBM,"When I first started watching this show, it was simply because I enjoyed how corny it was and the fact that I had seen both of these actors in Star-Gate SG1; but after a while I started to get caught up in the story.

After watching the two main characters fight each other in SG1, it was amusing to see where they came from in this show.  Shortly after this show ended Claudia Black got a role on SG1.  After McGyver left SG1, she got Ben Browder to replace him.  I'm fairly certain that Ben's wife was a bit happier with the role he played in SG1.

This show, although it had a rocky and somewhat ridiculous start, turns out to be a show worth watching.",1377734400,,655,4.166666666666667
2127181,3,B0002VGSBM,The show got too bogged down in the John Creighton is the Most Important Person in the Universe. Too many minor characters coming and going without any reason. I lost my ability to emphasize.,1377561600,,191,4.647058823529412

The last show of the fourth season made it appear that a fifth was on the way but that never happened.  It is sad that some shows are cancelled even though they are watched by many, as evidenced by the responses received to re-instate these shows.  All four seasons were very good and kept the interest of the audience but apparently not enough for the network to continue the program.",1376870400,,536,4.383838383838384

2127195,5,B0002VGSBM,I watched most of this series on the Sci-Fy channel when it aired but missed a lot of it. Being able to view the complete series on Amazon is great and not having to deal with the commercials makes it even better for me.

2127213,5,B0002VGSBM,"Although the story goes off into tangents that are hard to swallow sometimes and some of the characters and story lines get a little more sinister than I normally like to see in sci-fi, this story has a real feel to it and it is easy to suspend one's disbelief.  In other words, this is great sci-fi! This is a believable look at what might  be out there with no punches pulled.  The main characters are flawed heroes and even the villians have shades of gray that make them come alive in ways that reflect the real world. Unlike some sci-fi that depict the battle between good and evil as purely black and white, this show depicts a world with real depth, strong opinions, and noble intentions that do not always end well.  I was entertained throughout and highly recommend this show to hardcore sci-fi fans.

And the ending, I won't spoil it but it was so moving and poignant. Five stars for the overall series, four stars for this season. Truly one of the best ever and I will deeply miss Moya and her crew.

I admit I have days when I want to watch drama or comedies, but my first love has always been science fiction.  This show, in my opinion, was worth purchasing.  Some of the special effects were very low budget but the overall show was very entertaining.  Will definitely miss the fact there will be no more new episodes and entertainment.  Definitely worth the money.",1371427200,,456,4.5

2127236,5,B0002VGSBM,From the first episode to the last I have enjoyed Farscape.  I was sad to see it go in the manner it did.  It was by far one of the best written programs that I have seen on television.  I hope it comes back as maybe Farscape 2.,1370995200,,228,3.7083333333333335

2127240,4,B0002VGSBM,"This season was one of the best. it was filled with excitement and drama. the only downside is they left the series on a cliffhanger only to have it cancelled. though it is all wrapped up in the tv movie peacekeeper wars. only bad par tis its not available on prime for instant watching,",1370736000,,287,4.333333333333333

2127245,5,B0002VGSBM,Don't get me wrong they're all good but the characters really gelled this season. That's why I was amazed when it went off the air abruptly. if you watch this season you MUST watch the Peacekeeper Wars mini-series/movie. You'll see why!,1370044800,,236,4.780487804878049
2127246,1,B0002VGSBM,"Season 4 is terrific and in theory it's very convenient to have the whole season compressed onto a mere six disks in a single box instead of ten disks in five boxes.  But the picture quality and sound quality are TERRIBLE.  I don't know whether it's because of the compression, or for some other reason.  In the bad old days of VHS, this was the kind of picture and sound you got when you copied one tape to another. The images are high contrast and hard to look at, and the dialogue is sometime unintelligible.  I have some disks from the original release of Season 4 (on 10 disks) and the quality is vastly superior.  Look for the old release.",1369958400,,645,4.341666666666667

2127249,5,B0002VGSBM,"The Farscape series was cut short way too soon. This is the final season prior to its abrupt cancellation and the mind-bending nature of this series makes Farscape unique among science-fiction dramas. Jim Henson's creations add a dimension not seen in the typical space-opera which means that unlike Star Trek and other similar series, aliens are represented as more than just humans with special prosthetics on their heads.",1369785600,,424,5.25
2127250,5,B0002VGSBM,Season 4 did a great job of continuing the plot line set up by the previous seasons with much more auxiliary character developement.  The ending disappointed me because I knew there would be no more coming.  But if you liked the other seasons this one will not disappoint.,1369785600,,272,4.645833333333333
2127251,2,B0002VGSBM,"used to love this series ... sort of ""Lost in Space"" meets ""Giligans Island""

Obviously the series didn't do well as it ended after only 4 seasons and not the fault of writers director or actors. But you can sense the depression and a feeling of giving up even in the weird universe this story takes place in.

2127253,5,B0002VGSBM,Its unfortunate that this is the final season because the story isn't fully told leaving the conclusion to the feature length Peacekeeper Wars;. Even so I would rate Farscape as one of the best Sci Fi series ever.,1369440000,,213,4.631578947368421

Only watched a half dozen of this season but there seems to me more 'pseudo-sex' scenes and 'drug-induced 'trips' than before.  I'm for getting back to their core values of discovering new worlds and fighting the bad guys. But that's just me. Otherwise, I'm just now beginning to wonder I'll I'll survive the end of Farscape which is fast approaching. Oh no...!!!",1368144000,,528,4.802197802197802
2127260,4,B0002VGSBM,"Although it was filmed 10 years ago, the CGI of the time does not detract much from the show. The cast is good and the scripts are consistently well written.

However, just as I was starting the 4th season, Amazon changed it to pay-per-episode. Not cool. Oh well, Netfix streaming doesn't offer it either, but at least with them I can rent the discs.

I was so disappointed that I decided just to purchase the complete show all 4 seasons plus the final movie which completes the set.  This is a great science fiction show and has the qualities that you would expect from the creative minds of The Jim Henson Company.  It has a great storyline, great production quality, and a talented cast.  I don't buy many shows on dvd/bluray but this is one that I have made an exception for.

The characters new to season 4 are good, but the 'old' characters become cliche. The humor becomes very much focused on man-vs-woman things (like girls freaking out over vomit, men gaping at a young dancing women but freaking out over an old naked woman).

Most reviewers have covered this series really well. Two things I would like to add.

Scorpius. One of the best villains ever. A well rounded villain that's not really such a bad guy. His costume and makeup are awesome.

Cinematography. This series is an absolute joy to watch. Every aspect, from makeup to background shots, are colorful and rich. The aliens looks great, the costumes are impressive and the attention to detail is phenomenal. Farscape alien makeup is the best I have ever seen. Creating this series had to cost bigtime $$$$.

This is a series from Jim/Brian Henson so expect a very high quality production. Watching The PeaceKeeper Wars at the end is well worth the $10.",1358726400,,922,4.638036809815951

This product is a well done sci-fi TV series done for A&E networks.  The characters are engaging, even the muppets(Rygel) and (Pilot), sometimes fake looking but the voice actor and special guest in many episodes Lani Tupu makes the character come alive.  Ben Browder and Claudia Black have a good mix and a bond developed between actors that engages the romantic amid all the choas that Moira (living ship) that they travel in from adventure to adventure.  The supporting cast is great and some of the guess stars are okay.  I would have liked to have known that the episodes were filmed in 35 MM and not in HD which lacks a cleaness to the finished product but you must remember that the series was filmed according to the producers tastes and not necessarily for the TV fans.  Later releases come in Blu-ray and are execellently transferred with little or no video artifacts.  I have begun replacing all my non-Blu-ray collection with the Blu-ray editions.  Those that enjoy this series and want to add to their library must get the Blu-ray editions of each season (Complete seasons) and not the 2.1, 3.2 stuff etc.  Brian Henson has made sci-fi adult and fun in this series and any sci-fi fan will enjoy these episodes again and again.",1336348800,,1417,5.294642857142857

I remember watching the episodes contemporaneously with a dark heart and growing frustration as the various outlets jerked it around and starved it of money. I thought the final episode was, in fact, the producers showing their exasperation.

This is why I was delighted to get this collection. Watch the season again, and it's far lighter than you may remember. The horror was around the ""suits,"" not the players or the play. There are wonderful performances (by Ms. Black, of course, but Browder playing less maniacally is nice), ingenious, full on effects, and, of course, a respect for the viewer that has not been matched away from HBO.

2127313,5,B0002VGSBM,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-third-season-of-Farscape/dp/B002GP7ZVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The third season of Farscape</a>&nbsp;ended with the tried and true method of separating the main characters at a time of crisis so that the opening of the next season could involve their slow and painful attempts to reunite - with the added revelation that one of them is pregnant. A battle had been won but the cost was great for the crew of Moya: though successful in destroying a Peacekeeper research facility that was coming dangerously close to unlocking the secrets to wormhole technology, they lost two of their allies and were divided amongst themselves as they fled from a galaxy that placed even larger bounties on their heads.

To backtrack a little, it's worth giving a short summary of the show in general. A quirky and off-beat sci-fi series, ""Farscape"" centers on the adventures of American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browser), flung through a wormhole to the far side of the galaxy and thrown in with a group of escaped prisoners on board their sentient ship. Since then he's been hunted by the militaristic Peacekeepers and the war-like Scarrans, both of whom are after the wormhole technology that's been implanted in his head. All John wants to do is work things out with his beloved Aeryn (an ex-Peacekeeper) and make it back to his family waiting on Earth.

Of course, there's no point in starting your ""Farscape"" adventure this late in the game. In fact, it's very difficult to jump on board after the mid-way point of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-two/dp/B002GP7ZVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season two</a>, and naturally it's best to begin right back at the start of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-one/dp/B002GP7ZV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season one</a>. If you make the investment of time and money, then you're in for a well plotted, well characterized and immensely creative and colorful show, which takes the best of the sci-fi genre and twists it on its head. Our heroes are not Starfleet soldiers, but a motley bunch of escaped prisoners, and their aims are not lofty ideals of truth or justice, but the desire to live out their lives in relative peace.

That goal is becoming increasingly distant with the growing conflict in the galaxy, and the fact that its resolution lies locked in John's brain. Having been entrusted with the key to wormhole technology by the Ancients, John knows that he alone has the power to prevent war and ensure peace - if only he can figure out *how*.

The start of the season finds him scrounging out an existence on board a dying leviathan, joined quickly by a gold-skinned, red-haired, increasingly impatient alien named Sikuzo (Raelee Hill). Arrogant and brash, but with a keen mind and the ability to move her gravitational centre (giving her the ability to walk up walls and ceilings), she becomes a new regular cast member.

One by one, the crew of Moya reunites: warrior D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), thieving Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and ex-emperor Rygel (voiced by Jonathan Hardy). Last of all is Aeryn (Claudia Black), waiting aboard Moya with a surprise guest in tow: Scorpias. The half-Scarran, half-Peacekeeper (Wayne Pygram) is now on the run from the law along with the rest of them, and after spending the last three seasons trying to escape, avoid or outwit his insatiable desire for wormhole technology, Crichton now finds him necessary for his foster-family's survival. The real game-changer comes when Crichton finally makes his way back to Earth and the long-awaited reunion with his father, sister and the friends he left behind. But his presence there only poses a danger to his race, and after a time-traveling escapade back to the 1980s, an awkward reintegration with the world he left behind, an episode-long television expose on Earth's first contact with aliens, and the realization that he's been tracked by his enemies, Crichton makes the decision to return to space and work toward securing the safety of his home planet.

From there the episodes are continuously linked all the way up to the grand finale as Moya's crew enters the peace negotiations (better described as intrigues) between the Scarran Emperor and the Peacekeeper Commandant Grayzer. The fact that the three part episode finale is called ""We're So Screwed"" should tell you how well that goes, but the writing team excels with another tightly-written, nail-biting conclusion that ends on an equally jaw-dropping cliffhanger.

Season four is not my favorite ""Farscape"" season (that title still belongs to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-third-season/dp/B002GP7ZVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the third season</a>), but by this stage the writers know their characters inside and out, as well as where exactly the plotlines are going. It was therefore an outrage when the show was abruptly cancelled despite the network's promise that there would be a fifth season for the writers to wrap up their planned storylines - but never fear, there was a reprieve in the show's imminent close in the form of a four-part miniseries that brought ""Farscape"" to a swift, though satisfactory finish.

With this in mind, the forth season of ""Farscape"" definitely feels as though it's building toward something. There are far fewer filler episodes this time around (although there is invariably always room for the two that turn up every season: the one where Moya is attacked by some sort of parasite or virus, and the one where the crew wanders onto an alien planet and causes trouble amongst its culture). There is also some incredibly dark content this time around, including torture, slaughter, mind control, humiliation fantasies, and even the rape of two main characters - not graphically, but certainly explicitly. Don't be fooled by the bright colors of the packaging; this show isn't for the kids.

Among the supporting cast there is a late return from Stark (Paul Goddard) in the series finale, and we are also joined by a mysterious and rather batty three-eyed seer known as Noranti (Melissa Jaffer), who seems to know more about the circumstances than she's letting on. In her place the character of Jool (Tammy MacIntosh) is dropped, which is something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, Jool was never a popular character with audiences, on the other, she had been steadily improving over the course of the third season and by her last regular episode she had formed very sweet bonds with the core cast. It was a shame that the writers didn't trust their own development of Jool, as by the time she's shed her obnoxious exterior to become a useful team-member, they get rid of her.

Another nitpick is that the show is constantly let down by the weak acting of its extras. It's not so bad when they're hidden under layers of prosthetics, but some of the humanoid characters are painfully stiff and awkward sounding. And the only thing more grating than an Australian accent in uncharted space is an Australian accent disguised as an American accent in uncharted space (not that there's anything wrong with Aussie accents in general!) It wouldn't be so bad if it were not for the inconsistency of the accents used across the show, and as Joss Whedon said in a commentary for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>, a show relies on the good acting of its extras and bit-parts to create a sense of reality in their created world. When Crichton was reunited with his family and fellow humans at the season's midway point, it was the terribly stilted acting that pulled me right out of the emotional power of the scene.

Season four essentially revolves around two main plotlines: the relationship between John and Aeryn, and John and Scorpias's never-ceasing search for mastery over wormhole technology (with a rather intriguing alliance between Scorpias and Sikozu on the side). One of the side-effects of this is that many of the other characters are shunted to the side, and there is precious little development given to Chiana, D'Argo or Rygel and no real exploration into their cultures and home planets. In lieu of the promised fifth season, the spotlight never returns to them - one suspects that the proposed fifth season would have extended the Scarran/Peacekeeper conflict into a galaxy-wide war that involved all the alien species so far introduced to the show, a development that is sadly never to be realized.

Disregarding the Sci-Fi network's lack of foresight in canceling the show before its time, the forth season of ""Farscape"" pushes story and (most) character ahead into the future, once more raising the stakes and increasing the odds against our intrepid heroes. Make sure you have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Peacekeeper Wars</a>&nbsp;handy for the conclusion of one of the most innovative and imaginative sci-fi shows ever to hit television.",1284768000,,9218,5.433962264150943

We learn a bit more about Scorpy.  A new character is on board-is she friend or foe.  The biggest let down is not what is on the DVD, but knowing this show was cut short.  There was at least another season or two they could have done.  Thank goodness for the peacekeeper wars for closure",1281744000,,432,4.132530120481928
2127315,5,B0002VGSBM,"We all know how badly it sucks that Farscape was abruptly cancelled.  BUT, in season 4 you get the brilliance of an amazing, complex show, truly hitting it's stride. They nailed this, it's one of my favorite single seasons of all time.

The acting and directing is phenomenal.  You can sense that cast and crew have learned how to trust each other, and that they are not afraid to take risks.  Both acting and directing is confident, intense, and also not afraid to be playful.  They made me cry, they made me laugh, they made my jaw drop open. Multiple times.

The special effects and costumes and set design remain some of the most impressive ever on TV, and superior to many movies. That they were able to make this much magic 22 hours a year (7 years ago) blows my mind.  And season 4, of course is the best ever for visuals and effects.  They all have the basic visual language down cold by now, so they are able to polish and enrich existing props (notice how much more detailed the Droids are this season, or Rigel's puppet) The show has a much richer, more organic look this season. And while computer graphics have come a long way since 2003, Farscape still has some of the most visually arresting CGI ever made for the small screen.

Just don't expect a clean ending.  It ends on a cliff-hanger, the whole team was expecting at least one more season.  You want to watch Peacekeeper Wars after.

This season has some very disturbing images (Scorpius boot-licking, John's sexual enslavement, Aeryn's double with 1/2 her head blown off in loving close-up, various torture scenes)I definitely would not recommend it for pre or early teen viewing, and if I had a mature teen I'd want to at least talk about it before and after.

And it's got a few scenes that I thought didn't work. (including big chunks of ""John Quixote"")

The DVD is a bit disappointing.  While it has a number of special features, including deleted scenes and actor interviews, it is completely lacking any commentary tracks.  This show cries out for multiple commentaries from writers, producers, directors and crew, special effects, etc.  I was very let down that they did not do a commentary for at least a few episodes.

Despite that.  This is one of the most visually captivating, emotionally moving, and intellectually stimulating single seasons ever to be broadcast.  While I strongly recommend you watch Farscape from beginning to end, if you were only to watch a single season, make it season 4.

I know I will be branded the scourge of the Earth for the this review.  But I've watched every Farscape episode and I've got to tell you that Season 4 was a huge disappointment for me.  In that, the majority of the focus was on John and Aeryn to the near exclusion of the remaining characters.  Everyone but John and Aeryn simply stopped evolving to an appreciable degree.

Instead of the storylines being tributaries meandering through the lives of all the characters, there was only one steady flow raging through the lives of John and Aeryn.  Quite frankly, it got very old, very quickly for me.  Season 4 consisted of: Tune in next week to see John pining for Aeryn or Aeryn pining for John.  Tune in next week to see John looking for wormholes or Earth.  After 21 episodes, I was over hearing about the lovesick John/Aeryn, and even sicker of those frelling wormholes.

We never got to know more about D'Argo or visit the Luxan home world.  We never got know more about Rygel or visit the Hynerian home world.  And that goes for all of the other characters too.  The series ended with the Peacekeeper Wars, yet we barely got to see the animus that brewed between the factions.  Apparently there was a whole universe of interesting storylines out there but we rarely got to see any of them.  Why?

Because for some reason, the PTB thought we needed to see show after show of ""John loves Aeryn (and vice versa)"" and ""John/Scorpious love wormholes"".  Reminiscent of wasting three entire episodes (during the first season) on the absurd ""Princess loves John, demands to marry him, and suddenly the battle-hardened Farscape crew who have escaped from everywhere else are not even bothering with an exit strategy.""  Yes, I can see how these stories would be more interesting than powerful, warring factions plotting to destroy each other, along with any other species who get in their way.

Sorry folks, I cannot drink the Farscape kool-aid for Season 4. It was a huge let down for me considering it was the last season of the series. It was stagnate and missed an opportunity for the fans really enjoy ALL of the characters, including Pilot, in more than just supportive by-product roles.

I put on hiatus viewing my other sci-fi shows so I could devote my time to viewing all of the Farscape episodes.  It was a refreshing relief to get back to watching Stargate Atlantis, in which the action storylines drive the show instead of the passions of one or two specific characters.  Although, Rodney is quickly becoming the Crichton ""all about me"" focus of Atlantis...which is slightly bothersome.  But I'll save that critique for another day.",1203206400,,2825,4.732106339468302

2127327,5,B0002VGSBM,"Farscape was the best show on TV.  It was funny, serious, and had heart all at the same time.  I am still mad that it got pulled.",1162425600,,129,3.740740740740741
2127328,5,B0002VGSBM,"I love this show, it is the best show on tv today even in reruns, thank god it is coming back on some local channels this fall. To bad it was cancelled, but the good news is there is talk about bringing it to the big screen, that would be cool. The stories and characters were all amazing, the special effects were awesome. I think it is still better than just about anything else on tv right now, stargate sg1 is a close second. Battlestar galactica is being billed as the best space series on tv, in my opinion it is not even close. Ican't believe sci-fi channel let this go, can we say dumdasses.

  Well in any case all the seasons were great. The only thing that I wish was that the complete seasons 2,3,4 were truly complete and had the deleted scenes already edited back in like in the complete season 1. Other than that all is good.",1125273600,,840,4.2375
2127329,5,B0002VGSBM,"The fourth, and ultimately final, season of Farscape saw astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder) and Aeryn (Claudia Black) end up together as the seeds of what will be an uneasy alliance between Crichton and Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) are planted when Scorpius saves Aeryn's life.  War begins to brew as the reptillian-esque Scarrans now seek the wormhole technology Crichton knows to rule the universe, no matter the cost.  The series finale, appropriately entitled ""Bad Timing"", ends on a heck of a cliffhanger and both Crichton and Aeryn are blasted to bits, leading way to the recent, and outstanding, mini-series Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars.  While the fourth season of Farscape wasn't the best the series had to offer, it was still exceptional sci-fi TV that continued to soar in new and innovative directions.  In the end however, despite suffering the untimely fate of cancellation, Farscape did what shows like Babylon 5 and the various Star Trek series' couldn't do: continue to be original, intelligent, and just plain amazing, even while facing the inevitable threat of cancellation.  And by the time the Peacekeeper Wars are over, one can't pray for a better way to send off this supremely original and fantastic series.",1110240000,,1231,5.165829145728643
2127330,4,B0002VGSBM,"Love the series, but was quite confused.  It would appear that there's quite a bit missing between season 3 and 4.  The arrest of Scorpious following the destruction of his station was alluded to in the ""previously on Farscape"" bits at the beginings of the shows, but I never actually saw those particular scenes.  I went back through Season 3 in case I missed something, but found that I hadn't.  Either way, still a great series and I'm sorry to see it cancelled.",1105488000,,465,4.566265060240964
2127331,5,B0002VGSBM,A cliffhanger that must be seen with the soon to be released peace keeper wars and first 3 seasons. If you think this is a standalone set it will be good but like apple pie without the a la mode!,1101686400,,195,3.9
2127332,5,B0002VGSBM,"Now that word has arrived that we have the concluding mini-series (and thanks to all of my fellow 'scape fans for writing to Sci-Fi channel without which this would never have happened), I decided to take the plunge and buy season 4 to refresh my memory of what happened to Crichton and his merry band of pransters. Man what a great season. For those that need to know, this boxed is only different in one way from the individual two disc sets with season 4 episodes. It's cheaper. No other extra features besides a nice little box to put them inside. A pity I was hoping for something extra but, hey, with gas prices I'm happy I could save a few bucks. There are a number of strong episodes this season (and only one or two that I thought was absolutely lame)

In ""Crichton Kicks"" we are introduced to a new recurring character Sikozu as she crashes into the ship Crichton has taken refuge on in order to escape pirates interested in harvesting Leviathans. He's just about gotten his mathematical formula ready to go when she destroys part of it and they have to team up to stay alive. ""What Was Lost"" is an outstanding two part episode where Crichton hooks up with his buddies and sees Scorpious humiliated by a peacekeeper named Grayza who has delusions of grandeur. Finally Crichton finds Aeryn on Moya with her new friend Scorpious. It seems Scorpi saved her life and, as such, Crichton has a new shipmate.

The trilogy of""Unrealized Reality"", ""Kansas"" and ""Terra Firma"" finds Crichton and the rest of Moya's crew traveling to Earth but at the wrong time. Eventually, they find the right time but, unfortunately, their timing leaves something to be desired. The concluding three part episode ""We're so Screwed"" takes the series in an entirely new direction with Crichton mastering much of the wormhole information that's been locked in his head. It seems the Scarrans have taken Aeryn hostage in hopes of using her as bait to get him to give up the wormhole technology so the Scarrans can rule the known universe. Finally, we get the coda for season four (and the set up for the mini-series). ""Bad Timing"" ties directly into the preceding three episodes concluding the story arc with Crichton learning that the Scarrans may try to invade Earth. Crichton's only choice is to try and close the portal to Earth but will he ever be able to get back?

Picture quality is outstanding on each disc with a sharp, crisp high definition transfer. The 5.1 soundmix takes full advantage of the format and the sound has tremendous presence. The extras are numerous with the second and third season bloopers, interviews with cast, deleted scenes, set, prop and costume galleries, early make-up tests (which is really quite fascinating). Each indvidual box comes with a booklet with character histories, season four overviews, episodes synopsis and interesting photos. Special featurettes include ""Cool Farscape Facts"",  ""On the Last Day"" where we get behind the scenes footage for the season four wrap session,""The Story So Far"" which gives a brief update on the series to season four, ""Villains"", the usual ""Alien Encounters"" bits and ""Farscape Trailers"".

All in all another exceptional season. I do miss the commentary tracks. While they didn't have to be on every single episode, I would have enjoyed them on ""Bad Timing"" and the ""We're So Screwed"" trilogy. I suppose you can't have everything but I am quite happy that ""Farscape"" is returning even if only in a limited capacity. A pity that Sci-Fi blundered and cancelled it making us wait this long for the resolution but, hey, at least we have it.",1097625600,,3595,4.810679611650485
2127333,5,B0002VGSBM,"What can I say, I have been a Farscape fan since day one, and I have been active in the effort to save the show since day 1. I cant say enough good things about Farscape, no matter how many times I see an episode I still get ""goose bumpy"" when I watch. This DVD set is the perfect addition to your Farscape collection! Lets all keep our fingers crossed that we may soon see a season 5 after the miniseries blows away all previous Sci Fi Channel ratings:)",1097625600,,454,4.112359550561798
2127334,4,B0002VGSBM,Farscape continues to astonish which is why it is a complete mystery to me that it has been cancelled.  I know there is a mini series due on 15 October 2004 on the Sci-Fi network but that's in the USA - so what are fans elsewhere in the world supposed to do??? WAIT!again I guess.  Hopefully after this mini series there may be some good news about recommencement??  Yeah right!!! Whoever decides what is seen and what is cancelled shouldn't underestimate the viewing public.  The Fourth Season is great and can't wait to see the mini series. Thanks to all.,1097366400,,557,4.54
2127335,5,B0002VGSBM,"Season four came out the way I would have liked it to; Great. Episodes like Kansas and Terra Firma really set a bar in the way the series can throw twists at you. Aside from those two, most of the other episodes are great, especially the latter half of the season. Some episodes, IMO, were really lame like ""Coup by Clam"" and ""A Perfect Murder"", but they are easily negated by the relentless perfection that consumed most of the other episodes.

Fans of the series are sure to love the final four, which in a way sort of mirrors the final four of season three. I won't spoil anything, but the end of the series leaves fan wanting A LOT more. Cliffhangers can be deadly, especially one of this magnitude. Once you finally catch up on all 88 episodes, watch the mini-series on October 17-18, it's sure not to dissapoint.",1094515200,,818,4.453333333333333

After ADV got me with the 1st season's separate DVDs (which I bought for ridicules prices, then sold for almost nothing) I refused to buy it one DVD by one. Waiting was painful. ADV kept denying complete boxes plans, but who was going to believe them?

Now it's over... When miniseries DVD will be on sale :)?",1092873600,,461,4.75
