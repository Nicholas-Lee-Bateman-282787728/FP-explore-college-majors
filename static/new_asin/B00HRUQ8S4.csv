6200856,4,B00HRUQ8S4,"Though the cover shows Wolvie and Deathlok locked in combat that's the least of what it has to offer...
You get Cap, Spidey, Bucky (as Cap), even Nightcrawler (in a supporting role), oh and Deathlok. Deathlok killing everyone he can get his hands on. Seems Deathlok has a list of future superheroes and he's eliminating them, by killing them as babies or taking out the parents....

6200906,3,B00HRUQ8S4,"It is a motion comic, not an animation, so, in that sense, it didn't live up to my expectations.  I good story, but not what I was looking for.",1409443200,,143,3.9310344827586206
6200927,4,B00HRUQ8S4,Cool DVD but you have to love the animation or you won't like it.,1407888000,,65,3.7142857142857144
6200928,3,B00HRUQ8S4,"It is not the strongest of Marvel Knights Animated stories released so far. Deathlok (Deathlok Prime) was quite developed. He is full of self-interest and angst of inevitability. The rest of Deathloks were way too reminiscent of the Sentinels and the Master Mold concept of the Wolverine and the X-Men series.  The story does not mention how or why did Deathloks adapt things like Wolverine's claws and Stark's repulsers.

The title was a bit misleading. Why mention Weapon X, in the title of this particular piece that has nothing to do with it? Personally, after seeing Wolverine Versus Sabretooth (part 1), seeing Weapon X in the title got me excited for all the wrong reasons... I would love to see a MK Weapon X story, however.

Once I turned the DVD cover, I saw an illustration alluding to a fight in which Wolverine loses his hands. But, there is no scene depicting this event. I'd like to know how it happened.  Previously, MK animation showed us Wolverine torn in half by Hulk in Ultimate Wolverine Versus Hulk. This time around, MKA gave us two Captain Americas, but denied us a fight scene where Wolverine loses his hands.  Really?! We are used to him suffering great pains, so why didn't MK give Wolverine a great in-between fight is a mystery to me.

Unlike the rest of the animated Marvel Knights, this story felt incomplete, like an excerpt. Often, while watching the story, I asked myself, ""Is it a Wolverine story or is it a Deathlok story? What makes it a Wolverine story besides his presence on the screen?""

At this point, I will try to remain positive about the upcoming release of the MK: Eternals and anxiously assume that the second part of Wolverine Versus Sabretooth in the ""The Greatest Stories of Wolverine in One 5-Disc Set"" will possess enough redeeming qualities. I also hope that MK will release a separate Wolverine Versus Sabretooth: Reborn DVD for those of us who have the other 4 titles.",1407801600,3,1924,4.7253731343283585

6200957,4,B00HRUQ8S4,"There's 14 of these now so people should know that THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL ANIMATION.  If you go in expecting the 90's X-men cartoon you will be very disappointed.  This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?",1404172800,6,1526,4.551470588235294

6200961,1,B00HRUQ8S4,It is not even real animation.  it was like watching a comic book live on TV>  it was really terrible art work too.  i would never purchase anything the marvel knights put out again.  i would return it but i already opened it.  yuk,1401840000,,231,4.159090909090909
6200962,3,B00HRUQ8S4,"This one is not bad, but I think I would have given it higher marks if it had predated the Terminator films. The story is most certainly a copy of that story and I hate when stories resemble other stories that I have seen, heard or read about.",1401667200,,243,4.083333333333333

6200964,5,B00HRUQ8S4,I collected the first Deathlok comics way back as a teen and found this new story line inventive and well thought out. I liked the fact it had many characters besides Wolverine. I do not like the Marvel`s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. version in the TV series much. I enjoy the Marvel Knights series of animated movies and look forward to many more to come.,1401148800,,350,4.484375
6200965,4,B00HRUQ8S4,"I love the Wolverine marvel knights movies and this one is no exception. Wolverine is such a great character because he is so dark and ruthless. This movie may actually be bloodier than Wolverine VS Sabertooth, which by the way is another awesome Wolverine Marvel Knights movie! This movie offers alot more though than the previous Wolverine knights movies, especially character wise, with Spidey and America showing up, just to name a few, there are plenty more and definitely make the movie a fun ride. The animation is really well done, with the superb quality we have come to expect from Marvel. This is definitely a must see for any Wolverine fan!",1400457600,,652,4.830357142857143

8634950,3,B00HRUQ8S4,"The animation is substandard.  The characters aren't really developed.  Anyone not already familiar with these superheros won't understand much of the what's happening.

Still together the episodes make up a strong time travel story.  Cyborgs are sent back through time to prevent the rise of a resistance to their creators.  Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America, and many others battle those cyborgs.

Though they don't know it, the cyborgs are part of a time paradox.  Their travelling back in time brings about the very thing they were sent to stop.",1493510400,,554,5.2272727272727275
