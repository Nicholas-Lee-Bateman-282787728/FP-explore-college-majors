2517776,5,B000EGEVEG,"I've seen all of the chair massage videos out there, and this is one of the best! The instructor clearly explaines each technique that he uses. I've seen other videos with Meade Steademan (Essentials of Swedish Massage) and they are all great videos.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn chair massage or just to brush up on what they already know. It was well worth the money!",1207785600,7,383,4.550724637681159
2517777,5,B000EGEVEG,"This is a well done piece that covers just about everything you can think of, its long but not boring. Demonstrated is a complete body massage on the chair with anatomical explanations, including chair selection and setup at a location and many considerations. Kudos to Mr. Steadman on a job well done.

PS  also includes using your knees and more on the client.",1175644800,3,362,4.73015873015873

2517779,1,B000EGEVEG,"I sent it back.  I did not find this DVD set worth the money I paid for it and when returned only got 1/2 of my money back because it was opened.  I understand the company's thinking, but how else would you find out if the video is a stinker or not????  Way to much talking about info I did not need.  Might be good if you had never done, see or heard of massage ever in your life.  Not for the experienced CMT.",1170115200,20,411,3.8452380952380953

8109303,4,B000EGEVEG,I have been doing chair massage as a certified practitioner for 10 years but I didn't really learn much new.  The video would be great for someone who is fairly new to chair massage.,1484956800,,182,4.352941176470588

8109308,5,B000EGEVEG,"I've been in the massage industry for many years, and of the many courses I have taken, the video series with Meade Steadman truly trumps them all. I really appreciate how well made this massage video series is, and I found this one particularly helpful.

I began doing chair massage as a result of seeing this video. I had known of the income potential I would see if I made the investment in chairs and the proper training, and my expectations have been exceeded. There is an enormous demand for chair massage on an on-call and scheduled basis for different businesses especially, and I have been finding this work incredibly rewarding. If you're interested in taking some time away from the walls of spa or massage studio, this video will teach you everything you need to know.

When they say complete guide, they really mean it. I tried to think of questions the first time I watched this, and I really could not think of that many. The 2 hour+ length really covers everything that you might need to know. I'm really pleased that I decided to invest in my career and took the time to do this for myself. Chair massage is a great way to give relief to people who can't take a long break from the office, and I find that these are really the people that benefit from massage therapy the most.",1430524800,3,1294,4.478813559322034
8109309,5,B000EGEVEG,"I am a licensed Massage Therapist and my job is to do chair massage. I go to a lot of public and corporate events to give people 10 minutes of relaxation and relief, so learning new techniques is crucial for me to keep doing well at work.

This Guide was really helpful and I like trying the techniques it teaches one or a few at a time! It really keeps me on my toes and lets me switch up my chair massage routine to keep growing and learning as a therapist.

If you would like to improve your chair massage techniques, I definitely suggest trying it out! It's really awesome and informative/in-depth :D",1415145600,,604,4.336283185840708
8109310,5,B000EGEVEG,"Enjoyed viewing this dvd several times. Meade exposes us to a variety of new ideas to enhance a full body chair massage. He covers  common client complaints, as well as anatomical muscle charting and even reveals a few of his own trade secrets. Will definitely keep this one in my library and share it with other LMT's.",1401753600,,319,4.5964912280701755
