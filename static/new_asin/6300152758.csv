7803713,5,6300152758,I love this movie and it's very good. It came with a much better VHS quality than I thought it would be. Thank you very much and it shipped very quickly.,1375401600,,153,3.967741935483871
7803714,5,6300152758,"The 1980's were full of merchandise driven cartoons. Charmkins was no exception, but it is grossly underrated. Not many people remember this, and even *I* forgot about it for quite awhile. This is a cute little animated cartoon, from the same writers/producers/etc. of the original My Little Pony. The songs are catchy, the characters are cute, and it's just plain funny. In my personal opinion, Ben Vereen as the villian ""Dragonweed"" completely steals the show.",1342483200,,462,5.173333333333333
7803715,5,6300152758,My daughter now plays with all my old Charmkins toys and this movie is magical to her - she loves to see all the characters come to life on tv! Nice story about helping one another and being kind.,1255737600,,196,4.051282051282051
7803716,5,6300152758,This was one of my favorite cartoons from the 1980's.  I wore out my old VHS tape until it broke and was THRILLED to find it on Amazon.  Highly recommended!,1118966400,2,156,4.166666666666667
