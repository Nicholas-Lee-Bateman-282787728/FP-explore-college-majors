8311126,5,B0009UV7G2,"Cromartie Volume 4 - Mount Rockmore is the final chapter in the Cromartie High Story.

If you enjoy comedies about High School delinquents, Robots, and retired performance artists who are friends with gorillas then this just may be what you are looking for.

Do the guys ever actually get into a fight with a rival school? Will anyone finally confront Mechazawa and ask him about being a robot?

I enjoyed this series quite a bit, this is definitely one to add to your collection if you enjoy odd ball humor.
I was sad to see the show end, however like any good anime it doesn't overstay its welcome.

As Mechazawa Beta would say, ""Meka-ratta, Meka-ratta.""",1244160000,,656,4.678260869565217
8311127,2,B0009UV7G2,"I really really disliked it and felt that it wasn't that funny and wasn't worth your time or money. I have read other reviews though just to be fair and I have found that more than a few others have really enjoyed this series so maybe I just don't have the right sense of humor for a series like this. Then again, maybe I'm right and everyone else is wrong. It really doesn't matter either way, does it?

  The point I'm trying to make is that ever since I put the first DVD of this series in, I've felt like my time has been wasted on watching it and I'm glad that I don't have to pick it up again. If you really want to give it try, rent or borrow any volume of this series (it really doesn't matter which one since none of them have anything to do with each other really except in a couple of very small instances) and see if it makes you laugh. It sure didn't make me laugh though.",1214092800,,885,4.017045454545454
8311128,5,B0009UV7G2,"The intro is kind of boring, as there's no motion in it, but the music is kind of cool because it stands out compared to the series itself.  Kamiyama gives everyone a ""geography"" lesson, and you can already guess what's going to happen if you saw the episode where Cromartie has Freddy lead them to Bass High School.  Freddie becomes an economist, and he attempts to look for Bass High.  We finally see that Cromartie students are noticing ""two Takenouchis.""  We visit the Gorilla Sushi restaurant for the first time, yummy!  There's even banana sushi!  An animal lover's club is created, where one of the creator's dogs is even it it!  One of the Di Gi Charat characters comes to visit again!

Lastly, there's a creation of a female Cromartie school, and they are even in uniforms!  This DVD didn't have me laughing as much at the first two, but more than the 3rd one.  If bought the first two, you may as well get the last two to complete the set!",1145750400,,949,4.465116279069767
8311129,5,B0009UV7G2,"This last DVD of Cromartie High School is absolutely wonderful, just as all the others have been. The episodes are funny and witty, and always new and different. One episode follows the delinquents on a train ride to Kyoto, another episode features the gorilla in his own episode where he works at a sushi restaurant, and one episode even shows ""Cromartie Girls High School,"" where all of the (very familiar-looking) girls try to become the best ""princesses.""

The only sad thing about the DVD is that it's the last one for such an entertaining series. Cromartie High School is definitely my favorite comedy anime. Highly reccomended for anyone who wants a good laugh from something that *hasn't* been done a million times before.",1126137600,4,730,4.934959349593496
