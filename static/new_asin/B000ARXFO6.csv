8079169,4,B000ARXFO6,I love Whisky and was really looking forward to seeing the Scotch Whisky trail but the disk I received was the Irish Whisky trail DVD. but no worries it's a good disk,1382832000,,166,4.21875

I'm a single malt scotch drinker and I bought this video to give me an overview of the different styles of scotch that are produced throughout Scotland. The climate, soil, and geography of each region has an significant effect on the characteristics of the scotch, and after viewing this video I was enticed to add several bottles of single malt from other regions to my collection. My preference had always been to Highland scotch, but after watching this video I purchased an Islay and a Speyside scotch, and indeed they each possess very different characteristics that are noticable even to a novice.

Even though I highly recommend this video for anyone wanting to learn about single malt scotch, I only rated this video 4 out of 5 stars. In my opinion this video needs just a little bit extra to push it over the top.  I would have liked to see a couple more distilleries covered, so that within each region a range of lighter to more full bodied scotches could be covered.

Of course now that I typed up this review I'm in the mood to throw the DVD into my player and watch the video again.

Cheers!",1380499200,,1180,4.547169811320755

This is basically the same video, but this version is slightly different, and some may think better than ""On The Whisky Trail"" because it has slightly more info and less scenery and musical interludes.  But the majority of the video is identical and if I had not just seen the other video, I probably would say they were exactly the same video.  Though I really love Scotland and loved seeing the gorgeous scenery and hearing the music, since this is a documentary about Scotch Whisky (not ""Whiskey"" which is an Irish and American spelling), it is awesome to have even more content about the Whisky.  This is very nicely shot and the lilting brogue of the narrator helps you feel you are in Scotland, yet is not so difficult to understand that you want to put the close captioning on.  I learned very many new things about Scotch Whisky watching this and liked the tips and suggestions the narrator shared.  If you are a real expert on Scotch Whisky and have been to Scotland many times, you may feel less enthusiastic about this video, but for anyone who is just learning about Scotch Whisky, who is going to Scotland and wants to have some preparations for their trip, or like me, who has been missing Scotland and can't go back right now, this video will be lovely!",1376870400,,1368,4.586065573770492
8079172,5,B000ARXFO6,"Great video for someone just starting to drink single malt scotch.  It won't tell you how to taste, but rather the history and process of distilling.  It takes you on a tour of the better known distilleries while explaining how it works.",1202860800,7,237,4.619047619047619
