8484308,4,B005RHDL3Y,"Robert Cummings, who plays (Bob Collins), is on a tour with two war buddies, selling war bonds. He meets and falls for Lizabeth Scott (Ivy Hothckiss), who comes along to chaperone the 3 men. Bob does not want to fully committ to the relationship and Ivy doesn't find out why until...
