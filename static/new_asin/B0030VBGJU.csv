4046804,5,B0030VBGJU,"The best way to see RiffTrax is live in a theater, but watching this at home, I laugh almost as hard as when it was first performed.  Michael Nelson describes Plan 9 as the ""Citizen Kane of bad movies"", and he could be right.  I think the prize for worst movie ever made would be a two-way tie between ""Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"".  Plan 9 is bad, but doesn't quite make you feel as uncomfortable as those other two bad films.

The short before this film about air stewardesses is hilarious as well, although some of the other material created for this even fell a little flat.

Still, totally worth it and fun to watch with friends, and bears repeated viewing.",1335484800,,695,4.3565891472868215
4046805,5,B0030VBGJU,"I am so glad that I bought this, it was very neat to see them perform in front of a live audience.
I think this pressure encouraged this team to write some of the best material in a long time. The movie is so bad it is hard to believe that it was made.

4046806,5,B0030VBGJU,"If you're an MST fan, you'll be glad to know the shtick lives on in Rifftrax with Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett continuing to provide the hilarity that helps us survive grade Z drek like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" This is a live show done in a theater in Nashville with our heroes riffing as the movie is shown to an appreciative audience. This makes for a fun atmosphere, and they throw in a few surprises along the way and have a couple of guests. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.",1271548800,,502,4.294736842105263

4046808,5,B0030VBGJU,"My review is based on seeing the live performance back in August of '09. I don't think seeing the same performance on a smaller screen will be as funny, but it will still be side-splitting hilarious. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, & Bill Corbett are in great form and the results are well worth buying this DVD for your collection.

Perhaps the only worthy criticism is that they tried to make a ""show"" of it, highlighted by a somewhat nervous host (""Internet Superstar"" Veronica Belmont), a couple of songs from Rich Kyanka that you can take or leave, and a funny performance by Corbett of ""Plans 1 - 8"". It certainly may have influenced the next Live Show (the ""Christmas Shorts"") which restricted itself to riffing the shorts alone.

We start with the highly riffable short, ""Flying Stewardess"" a trip into the late 40's to see what it was like to train as a ""Stewardess"". I'm sure this will be popular with all MST3K/Rifftrax fans across the country, save perhaps for the citizens of Ft. Worth, Texas, who's city gets a good natured skewering.

Getting to the main event, ""Plan 9"" is so terrible as a film that it doesn't matter that it was presented in faux-color (heavy on pastels in some scenes). The riffing was wonderful, but at one point when the alien commander gives an unreal long-winded speech the riffing stopped as the audience howled in the joy of the moment. So bad, so effeminent, so gawd-awful long it was that at the end when Corbett popped off, ""I think that was one sentence."" the theatre exploded.

If you were there, this DVD is a must. If you are a fan, this DVD should be in your collection. If you are not sure, I would suggest viewing the first two Rifftrax shorts DVDs to get the flavor of the comedy.",1264464000,9,1727,4.543408360128617
4046809,5,B0030VBGJU,"I was fortunate enough to see this LIVE when it ran the first time around (it was so popular that it had a ""live"" repeat performance a few weeks later same theaters) and I concur with the previous two reviews.  While I did enjoy the attempt to (loosely) connect Coulton's Zombie song to the Plan 9 movie, the movie itself was the main attraction.  I also attended the Christmas Shorts Live program which may or may not be released to DVD at sometime for home viewing and while they were still good clean fun (many more families I noticed were present at this theater, the same one where I saw Plan 9) and in true Rifftrax/MST3K form it just wasn't quite the same as this Live event.

I purchased mine direct from the Rifftrax site (which actually cost a bit more than the Amazon price) and I'm not disappointed that I can now share this evening of laughs with friends who weren't able to attend or just watch it myself again, and again, and again, and again...  No matter how many times I see Plan 9 even without the Riffing just because it's the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad films but somehow the LIVE Riff even makes my old copy of the B&W Riffed version seem somehow inadequate.  This one has the colorized version of the movie so if you want to be a purist just turn off your color bar and see it in the original GLORIOUS B&W version as originally released by Ed Wood to theaters in 1959.  Either way just GET A COPY so you too can Laugh Out Loud!

I would highly recommend this to any fan of both RIFFTRAX and MST3K even with the music.  As a previous reviewer said, you can forward fast the parts that you don't want to see if you just want the shorts and the movie.  Peace out.",1263513600,5,1677,4.264984227129338
4046810,5,B0030VBGJU,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this first RiffTrax Live event. By the time it was over, I'd laughed the hardest I'd probably laughed in a year or two!

Other than the two ""riffed"" films, there were some other short comedy bits of variable quality. There were some fake commercials, one of which I made our audience and I laugh, but the other not so much. This was my first, and likely last, experience with Jonathan Coulton. I know he is extremely popular in some circles, and if you are a fan I'm sure you'll like to see him here. Personally, I'm thankful that I can skip past him on the DVD.

On to the main films, both Plan 9 and the stewardess short were comedy gold. It was like an especially good old Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. The shots where they showed the guys off to the side while they ripped on the movie were a great idea. It was a lot of fun to see their expressions and when they even cracked each other up.

Mike, Kevin, and Bill definitely brought their A game for this one. If you enjoy RiffTrax or are an old MSTK fan like I am, I wholeheartedly recommend this.",1261008000,12,1095,4.2548076923076925

Also on the program is the mildly amusing musical comedy of Jonathan Coulton, as well as the Rifftones.

4046819,5,B0030VBGJU,"This two hour comedy makes an enjoyable evening of entertainment. The RiffTrax crew is best when they do their shows live. They come out strong with ""Flying Stewardess""  a short that makes you think, ""Now we have to pay to bring luggage?"" I had never heard of the singer Jonathan Coulton before and was planning on FF through his act but his two songs were a delight. The riffing of Plan 9 was good and steady but the subject is the worst move ever made so that's as difficult as handing out Halloween candy. My four year old niece's dancing recital had better production values than Plan 9. Only weak moments were the 2 fake commercials which were juvenile but they don't last long.  Best riff is Mike Nelson doing the voice of the count from Sesame Street: ""One. Two. Three. I count three Bela Lugosi's.""",1485302400,2,806,4.513698630136986

4046822,4,B0030VBGJU,"It was fun, but not exactly a blowout.  When you take one of the alleged worst movies ever made, insulting it -- even by the the linear descendants of Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot -- is a little like shooting fish in a barrel.  I'm enough of a purist to think that PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE should be seen in its original black-and-white, but there are so many of Ed Wood's brain children out there that rights to the B&W may have been an issue.  The ""filler"" material designed to drag a movie of a little over an hour into a nearly two-hour format was mixed: a 1940 short about airline ""Stewardesses,"" pretty good folk singing, perfunctory emceeing, and as for the phony commercials -- let's just say that SNL has nothing to worry about.

I had an advantage that many but not all here share:  I belong to Prime, which made this viewing free.  I honestly feel, though, that PLAN NINE works best all by itself, without mediation, so that its glorious awfulness can sink in directly.  Having said that, let's not forget that there's a terrif 1994 movie out there that spends a good deal of time on PLAN NINE and the absurdities of its casting and making:  ED WOOD.

4046840,1,B0030VBGJU,"Of all the Rifftrax output I've seen this was by far the worst and lazy to the point of being insulting. I tried composing a succinct narrative to encompass all the awfulness but it kept getting way too long. Instead, here's a list:

1. In general Rifftrax is a bit weak when compared to the combined writing talents that produced MST3k, but this one had an over abundance of low effort, dumb and schmaltzy jokes. Almost none of the zing and wit the guys are capable of is present.
2. A large portion (if not the majority) of the run time a lame variety show that precedes the actual film. It includes cringe worthy off topic shorts, a wooden stand up act, and novelty musical 'humor' acts.
3. The footage is taken from a live event on a stage. Whenever the film is full screen (for us the viewers), the frame rate is off and intolerably choppy. However, when we see shots of the riffers with the film projected on a screen behind them on stage, the frame rate is fine.
4. Plan 9 is doesn't need a riff track because the badness is so dense and egregious that no human can process it all in real time anyway. The presence of a riff track actually obstructs and distracts from the film and detracts from the experience. I noticed this particularly in how the the riff dialogue often ran over the film dialogue. I always suspected this was why MST3k never did this, but did do other Ed Wood films.
5. Perhaps the greatest sin of all, they used a COLOURIZED version of Plan 9.

Don't waste your time or money on this low effort, dumbed down, cynical cash grab. Watch the original film instead, which is now public domain and therefore FREE anyway.",1480636800,,1644,4.404605263157895

4046849,5,B0030VBGJU,"RIFFTRAX films are fun to watch, especially if your favorite seasons of MST3K are the SCIFI channel years. (Season 8-10)  Joel fans might want to stick with CINEMATIC TITANIC. Joel's my preferred captive on the SOL, but I'm just fine with Mike too. Mike, Bill (the ersatz Crow after Trace left) and Kevin have fun riffing on the Ed Wood Jr masterpiece PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. This version of the film is colorized, which some might argue cheapens the stark effectiveness of the black and white palate. Attempting to point out the technical peccadillos from such an established, influential classic Wood's Plan Nine, might seem to be an effort in futility. When the cops stand against the stark, frozen sky at the graveyard, are the seams in the sheet part of Wood's process, an element of his vision? I think so. What about the three foot by four foot tomb, just under 5 feet high, which houses an extended cast, during the heart wrenching scene when Bela's wife was buried, in the tomb of her eternal rest? Watching 9 people come out of the tiny mausoleum might cause one to call that tomb a ""clown house"", but is that accurate? Doesn't it rather point to the way the eternal world is much larger than our world? And what of the fragrant yellow roses in front of Bella's humble home, which his wife planted with the greatest care, using her own hands?  Should poetry so sublime be sullied by riffing?  And what about the worrisome tracks on Bella's arms, which tell of his yearning for a little taste, how should that be viewed? With riffing, or perhaps more of Wood's ineffably beautiful poetic description? More Wood, I say. And I was shocked to learn, that there was a body double for Bella, since he didn't do all his scenes, due to death's untimely call. Thanks to riffing, that was pointed out too. So the riffing sort of ruins what I always perceived as the technical perfection of this film. I didn't care to hear riffing over Tor Johnson's well executed lines, (Obviously studied with Stanislavski, to catch such shades of characterization)  or have riffing detract from Vamparella's stately role of Bella's wife, who planted the fragrant yellow roses with so much love, using her own hands. Those tender hands that left this mortal coil far too soon, only to fall victim to the reanimation technology of Aliens. Aliens who's most recent plan, that being plan 9, involved resurrecting the recent dead. (Well, three of them anyway.)

Besides the remarkable technical achievement of Ed Wood's PLAN NINE, the LIVE RIFFTRAX DVD version of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE contains a few extras, which you don't get from the STUDIO version of RIFFTRAX's PLAN NINE. The LIVE version for starters, contains what amounts to a live ""laugh track"" from the audience.  I've watched a LIVE RIFFTRAX movie at the cinema once, and it does make a difference, hearing people enjoy the jokes along with you. The LIVE version includes a well riffed short from the 1940s, about how Stewardesses are trained. (Its so incredibly sexist your head will spin.) There's an acoustic guitar troubadour singing a couple of comedy songs, which you might find fun. The two little mock commercials by Lowtax Kyanka I could probably do without, but they weren't horrible though. Then, Kevin, Mike and Bill sing a song about Plans 1 thru 8, which is typical for MST3k type humor. (Their comedy songs were always one of the highlights of that show, in my opinion.) The RIFFTRAX guys go all out for their LIVE shows, so you'll find maximum entertainment for the audience members shelling out $15 to watch an Ed Wood movie. The DVD version of the live show, will offer more comic punch, than the standard riffing on just the Plan 9 movie, for that reason. If you'd like to explore other LIVE RIFFTRAX features, I suggest SHARKADO, or better yet, MANOS.",1478217600,,3820,4.7368421052631575

There are so many things wrong with this train wreck of a movie that PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE (1959) fully deserves its widely accepted title of ""the worst movie ever made.""

The odd thing is the middling material the RiffTrax guys have to offer this time around. Perhaps I'm biased: my first experience of this movie was a screening at a comics/sci-fi convention where the audience provided its own nonstop commentary in sheer self-defense against PLAN NINE's overwhelming stupidity. It's so unintentionally hilarious on its own that professional riffers are hard pressed to come up with anything that the average roomful of geeks couldn't ad lib for themselves. Still, it's great fun to revisit the mother of all cinematic turkeys, and the colorized version on view here doesn't look bad, even if it's no improvement over black & white, either.

No one gets mad when they buy a concert version of their favorite songs.  This is the concert of Plan Nine from Outer Space.

4046899,5,B0030VBGJU,"Mike and the guys are back and in fantastic form in this DVD from Rifftrax! I have had the pleasure of seeing the Rifftrax live shows and they are not to be missed! I watched this one with my husband at home and we laughed throughout the entire show! Mike, Kevin and Bill are so talented and have such wonderful comedic timing. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to come home from a long day at work and just needs to laugh! Or, invite some friends over and order the pizza and have a blast with the Rifftrax guys!! 5 stars from me!",1396310400,,541,4.161904761904762
4046900,3,B0030VBGJU,"I was excited to see the rifftrax guys skew this terrible movie. The riffing was decent, but theres just not that much you can do with this movies. The DVD has a bunch of extras, They riff a short, and there are some fake commercials from somethingawful, but in all this is not the best.",1389571200,,287,4.236363636363636

4046902,5,B0030VBGJU,It was as enjoyable to watch as RiffTrax:Birdemic (A personal favorite)so I can't help but give this a 5 star review.  They really do put a lot into making these shows great.,1384300800,,174,4.4375
4046903,5,B0030VBGJU,I have been a fan of mystery science theatre 3000 for years and always wondered why they never did plan 9.  Well this is as close as it gets and it's well worth it.,1355097600,,164,3.823529411764706
4046904,2,B0030VBGJU,"I have Plan 9 from outer space rifftrax. I bought this dvd because it stated live. I thought there would be new riffs like they had done with reefer madness, but it was the same riff as the regular plan 9 rifftrax. There are some shorts and even music? For me at least the shorts weren't that good. I would not have bought this If I knew the movie would be exactly the same. So, If your just interested in the movie, the regular rifftrax or the live rifftrax are identical.",1337212800,4,473,4.208791208791209

8386119,2,B0030VBGJU,"Glad they ditched all the extras in this for their later live shows. The host had NO idea who Mike, Kevin and Bill were (she has to look at their names on the screen behind her while introducing them); the musical acts were unnecessary and almost as worthy of riffing as Plan 9 itself; and lowtax is a completely different type of humor and was completely out of place.

Once you get to the riffing, it's pretty standard, but still worth a watch. Just be sure to skip forward 30 minutes.",1515456000,,487,4.351648351648351

8386121,5,B0030VBGJU,"I've loved Plan 9 for decades and have watched it countless times for laughs.  The Rifftrax commentary, although humorous, didn't add more laughs than were already in the movie.  Maybe different laughs, but not more.",1505520000,,216,5.142857142857143
8386122,4,B0030VBGJU,"This is better than the original by a hundred-fold.  We start out with a short, a song or two and a couple ""ads"".
Bela Lugosi never had it so bad.
Plan 9 is there absolute what movie ever.  What's better than an absolute crappy movie?  MST3K's voiceovers!
How do you make THAT better?  Live! from Nashville.  (Sorry, Fort Worth!)",1501804800,,329,4.508474576271187

8386126,4,B0030VBGJU,"very funny, but I wish they would have focused on and made more comments relating to the incompetence of Ed Wood. after all it was his writing that made this movie so hilarious. also, please stay away from the political stuff, I don't like that.",1486771200,,245,4.466666666666667
