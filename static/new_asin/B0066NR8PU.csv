Wolf Town is a nice little piece that is much much better than SyFy original garbage. I say it's at least worth a rental. I will admit that I'm partial to ghost towns and the one in the film is pretty nice.

Add some bad dialogue, obviously fake stunts and blood and some goofy acting, and what do you get?  Pretty much a waste of time with no purpose and no reason for these wolves to want to inhabit a town.  They live in the woods, after all!",1331510400,,318,4.015873015873016
4962610,1,B0066NR8PU,"""Wolf Town"" is terrible. Please don't waste your time or money on this movie. It s poorly directed with bad acting and boring dialogue. Wes Craven's ""The Breed"" is by no means a great movie but is much more serviceable than this piece of crap. The pacing is terrible with long streaches of nothing happening. There is nothing redeemable here. Avoid.",1330819200,3,349,4.737704918032787

IT WAS HORRIBLE! The plot was transparent, after watching it for 5 minutes I wanted to beat the 2 guys up they were talking so badly! The movie was bad, just plain BAD. If thye had better actors, I mean if they were better looking, nicer, and well not trying to push each others buttons all the time well it might have turned out differently. The wolves? Well they aren't even supernatural, there is no one helping them so HOW IN THE WORLD did they take a chunk out of a car wiring? Where did the womans backpack go? The wolves would need to have hands and thumbs in order to take out the wires (they looked cut!).
The set itself was awesome, wonderful detail, BUT it looked like it had only been there for a 40 or 50 years not falling down if you touch it kinda old (they were tramping thorough a saloon, walking up and down the stairs balancing on an OLD looking barrel...)",1464220800,,945,4.197802197802198

8494185,2,B0066NR8PU,"I have seen the future of tedium and its name is WOLF TOWN.  If theres a wrong way to make a horror movie, this is it.

The story, for lack of a better word, starts simply enough.  Kyle has talked his friend Jess into going to a ghost town with him for no real reason at all other than it might be interesting.  Kyle digs Jess but is too scared to tell her.  So he invites his friend Ben along on the pretence of looking for gold, which has something to do with Bens college courses I think.  But when they go to pick up Jess, she arrives with her boyfriend, Rob.

Bummer.

Well, they take the 4-hour drive anyway, wind up at the ghost town and have a terrible time.  Kyle is already pouting the entire way there, then gets mad at Ben for trying to make conversation with Rob who is obviously a big D-bag because Jess is supposed to by KYLES date on this trip.

After about 10 minutes of looking around the town, and Kyle claiming he saw a wolf a few minutes ago--a claim no one buys--they head off to see some more sights while Ben stalks off alone because Kyle is being a big baby.  Meanwhile, Kyle wanders into the old saloon where Jess and Rob are exploring, and pouts a little more.  A few minutes later, Ben returns, bloody and on the verge of passing out.

They cant call for help because Jess left her cell phone in her backpack, which she left in the car.  So they carry Ben outside, trying to leave the deathtrap, only to find something has torn out some of the wires from under Kyles dash, rendering the car useless.  Theyve also stolen Jesss backpack with her cell phone.

Who would do such a thing?

The answer is made pretty clear very soon as the remaining trio are set upon by a pack of wolves.  See, Kyle SAID he saw them, but no one believed him.  Bet they feel pretty stupid now.

The next 12-18 hours are spent with our heroes--such as they are--moving from deserted building to deserted building, from the saloon to a barn to a house to what looks like maybe a meeting hall, all the while trying to keep the wolves from getting in and eating their faces.  They concoct several brilliant plans to escape, ideas so crazy they just might work.  None of them do, of course, so they run to another building and start the whole process over again.

Now, I got into this movie, at first thinking it might be about werewolves, but then when it turned out they were just regular wolves, I figured it must have been a person who took Jesss backpack and cut the wires in Kyles car.  So we were dealing with some kind of psychopath who has a pack of trained wolves.  Okay, its kind of dumb but Ill live with it, if they can pull it off.

Problem is, that wasn't the case either.  They were just regular old wolves.  Not even super smart mad scientist created wolves, just a pack of standard issue wolves.  Okay, maybe they just happened to get Jesss backpack because she left a sandwich in there and forgot about it.  But they also knew just which wires to rip out of Kyles car to keep it from starting?  Better yet, they knew TO rip out the wires?

This ghost town was taken over by wolves--according to a diary Jess finds in the saloon, of course--in the 1800s, and, since the authorities haven't come in to destroy the dangerous wolves, one assumes no ones been there since, so how exactly do these wolves understand the workings of a car?

Better yet, if Kyle is somehow able to do some sort of pre-trip research on this town, which used to be called Paradise, how is it that he knows about this town and yet NO ONE has been there since it was abandoned who may have done something about the pack of wolves guarding it?  I think it stands to reason if this place is popular enough to have information about it available to the public, someone at some point in time, would have stopped in there and done something about the wolves.  I mean, its not like Paradise was a haven for rats or something, they're killer wolves.  And lots of them.  Surely the place hasn't been totally empty since the 1800s.  That grass looks way too maintained.

The acting from everyone involved was laughable at every point in the movie.  Levi Koehler (PUPPET MASTERS: AXIS OF EVIL) as Kyle was one of those unsympathetic heroes you want to punch as soon as he comes on screen.  Its not even anything he does necessarily, theres just something about his character that makes you hate his face.  Alicia Ziegler as Jess seemed really familiar to me, but Ive seen exactly nothing else shes been in, with the exception of about 5 minutes of LAKE PLACID 2, so that may have been it.  Whatever it was, her character was not endearing at all.  She even knows the entire time, has known for a while, that Kyle likes her--and she likes him back--so she brings her boyfriend along?

Rob and Ben (Josh Kelly, TRANSFORMERS: Revenge of the Fallen, and Max Adler, Glee, respectively) were non-entities even in a movie with only 4 characters.  They may as well have been called Plot Device 1 and Plot Device 2 for all the good they did.

Paul Hart-Wilden (ALONE) is responsible for the dumb script which asks us to believe things so outrageous that the very idea of suspension of disbelief is almost an insult to the audiences intelligence (the wolves opened Kyles drivers side door, tore out those wires, and quietly closed the door again?), while the movies direction was equally botched by John Rebel, whose only other movie, BEAR, sounds a lot like WOLF TOWN, except with bears.

WOLF TOWN is the kind of movie you want to hurt.  You want to find those responsible and dump their books and steal their lunch money for wasting so much of your time.  On a positive note, if youve ever wanted to find a movie that was just so incredibly unbelievable almost from the very beginning--and continued that theme throughout--because you were teaching a class called Youre Doing It Wrong, your search is over!  So youve at least got that going for you.",1393372800,,5922,4.402023919043239
8494186,1,B0066NR8PU,"If you believe wolves can get under the hood of an automobile, tear it apart, AND steal a cellphone, BUT cannot hear a 185-lb. man climbing down a rickety ladder from an upstairs window, then THIS is your movie.  It's so bad, it actually almost defies description.  There is no character development, no kind of story that would interest anyone, zilch.  What there is is the wussiest main character I've seen in quite a long time (so much to point that I just wanted to kick him until he was dead) and his ""teenage"" pals who make one stupid decision after another.

On the other hand, the wolves (although I think they might have been hybrids of some sort) are  beautiful.

Skip it.",1343260800,,682,4.504065040650406
8494187,2,B0066NR8PU,"If the story's protagonist is supposed to sit in a corner and cry while his dream girl figures out what to do is smart writing, screenwriters Paul Hart-Wilden and Asabi Lee have a short road to the Oscars. The lead protagonist, Kyle (portrayed by Levi Fiehler), reminded me of Tad from ""Cujo"" except he's all grown up. I wanted the wolves to kill and eat Kyle and pick their teeth with thin bone fragments of what was left. Unfortunately, I can't give all the intelligent filmmaking credit to the screenwriters. Behind every script, there is a director who'll bring words to life. The man in this position is John Rebel who believes wolves can steal purses out of vehicles and chew through wires so their victims can't leave the hunting ground. John Rebel also believes grabbing one stick of dynamite out of an entire box of dynamite will take care of any angry cannibal wolf territory. It was refreshing for the filmmakers to utilize real animals and not CGI. Of course, it would upset PETA if the wolves had much contact with the actors because the actors might accidently harm them! John Rebel was so thoughtful of this that he just let the wolves run around, wag their tails, peek through windows, and have staring contests with the cast. Aw... Sounds like ""Bring Your Wolf to Work Day!"" For what it was... 2/5.",1336348800,,1315,4.648068669527897
8494188,3,B0066NR8PU,"This movie was a bit on the slow side, but that was ok. There are enough movies out there jam packed with action and no real thought behind them. And yes, it had to have the humans are evil and shouldn't disturb the animals thing, because humanity has no right to exit at all. (We've all seen this before.) The score was somewhat lame at points but when the wolves came out to play the music was pretty effective. It's obviously a low-budget effort, but when the budget is low sometimes you have to work a little harder. It wasn't that scary, but I did care who would survive. The scenery and the town were eeriely beautiful. The alpha male guy was annoying as he was supposed to be, but he didn't have all the tough testosterone dialogue these stereotypes usually have. If anything, the wolves were mostly beautiful, save a few that actually looked old, sick, evil and rabid. The female lead (The Girl) was brave but no warrior princess. (I'd go out with her.) The characters were plausible to me, so I give it a six of ten. I recommend it if you want a light tale, you like wolves, and don't want fonts of gushing blood and hunks of flesh everywhere. This movie was a change of pace from other young-people-go-to-the-woods-and-must-survive-some-hideous-threat flicks. Worth a look!",1334448000,,1283,4.631578947368421
