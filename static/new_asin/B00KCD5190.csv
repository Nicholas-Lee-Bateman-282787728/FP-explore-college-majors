8657593,5,B00KCD5190,"I really enjoyed the content of this DVD. The only problem I experienced was the audio was a little annoying. During the parts with the classical music, I had to turn the volume down because it was extremely loud and distorted. If you are a Famous Monsters of Filmland fan, this is a must see!
This holds special meaning to me because I grew up reading FM, and was lucky enough to have my Picture published in the ""Wanted More Readers Like"" section in issue #113. I also visited the Ackermansion in 1997. I got some very cool footage of Uncle Forry on my visit. So this DVD was special to me and would be to any other FM fans.",1453161600,2,626,4.225
8657594,5,B00KCD5190,"I am what is known as a ""monster kid"" from the late 1950's through the 60's and collected Forry's Famous Monsters Of Filmland, Spacemen, and Monster World magazines so this video presentation of the wonders contained in his ""Ackermansion"" of science fiction, horror, and fantasy memorabilia was a joy to behold and would highly recommend this DVD to anyone else interested in the genre.",1434499200,,386,5.046875
8657595,5,B00KCD5190,"I believe there was a CD ROM that came out a few years back that gave an ultra-detailed tour of ""Uncle Forry's"" legendary collection. I never saw that CD ROM, but this DVD has to be the next best thing. I always fantasized about visiting the ""Ackermansion"" and almost got my wish when I visited L.A. back in 1994, but alas, when I rang Forry's number his assistant informed me that Forry was away that particular weekend, attending a convention somewhere, and that it would not be possible to tour the mansion. Drats!!!! So this DVD goes at least in some small way to fulfilling that long held dream. Recommended.",1426636800,4,613,4.581818181818182
