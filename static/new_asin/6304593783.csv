7875278,1,6304593783,"My son has developed an interest in the Titanic.  When I saw this video, I assumed it was an interesting documentary about the finding of the Titanic.  It, however, is almost not about the Titanic at all.  First it compares  the size of the titanic to footage of current ships.  Then it goes into  extreme detail about the robotic camera, the cable it will use, and how it  works. We see footage of many days at sea with no results.  The narrator  seems to think it is an opportunity to showcase his acting skills as he  rambles about the sunset, and other things. After 46 minutes of boring  video, the last minute shows finding the titanic and you see 60 seconds of  the same shot over and over - which has no detail at all - part of the  rudder.  We were gravely disappointed and only wish we could return it.",949017600,7,812,4.291390728476821
