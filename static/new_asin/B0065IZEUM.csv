I  watched  this  show  constantly  as  a  kid.
The  only  thing  I  hated  was  that  the  show  was  less  then  half  an  hour.
The  episodes  aren't  really  that  long.  Growing  up  there  were  about  2  or  3  episodes  per  day.
&  no  matter  what  kind  of  solution  the  smurfs  are  dealing  with  they  always  come  out  on  top.
I  like  Brainy  Handy, Vanity, Grouchy, Jokey,  &  Clumsy  the  best.
Its  good  to  know  amazon  now  has  the  complete  series.",1504310400,,574,4.030927835051546

The PAL DVD masters are edited with brand new digital photoshop-looking ""title cards"" (to correct US spelling with UK) and ""ending credits"" (to stick on [...] to look modern I guess? The worst of it is they removed the original music and used some stupid happy music that isn't from the original series. Since the copyright on the package states it is a joint ownership I can only assume this was done just to make a ""derivative"" work.

The NTSC masters by WB (available on DVD and Instant video) are the original unedited masters with everything in tact the way you remembered them.",1386892800,7,628,4.598214285714286
