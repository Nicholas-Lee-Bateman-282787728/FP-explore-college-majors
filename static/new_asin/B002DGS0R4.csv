8365122,2,B002DGS0R4,"This is not a typical exercise or stretch DVD, which was my first unmet assumption. The DVD itself uses computer generated figures to explain over and over, during the course of the video, the cause of muscle pain (tightening) and how stretching loosens it. The selection options for navigation do not highlight in the color red, but in gray, which is deceptive until you learn this unusual idiosyncracy and become habituated to it, because there are navigation selections that are permanently highlighted in red in some areas of the DVD. At first I kept replaying sections over and over because the default selection (also listed as most important) was in red and I could not figure out which option was being selected. This was a definite disappointment for the excessive price to find out about stretching what I already knew. I will continue to buy and use the many exercise DVDs where real people talk to me on camera, demonstrating the stretch technique in a flowing manner, where I can easily navigate from one section of the DVD to the next without repeatedly hearing about poor posture and muscle tightening over and over in each separate section.  I gave it an extra star for hope that someone else finds it more valuable, who will more likely be a tech savvy but biomechanically ignorant customer who finds the professional background of the DVD creator and the stretches more informative.",1321747200,2,1400,4.882352941176471
8365123,5,B002DGS0R4,I had knee surgery two years ago and have went to rehab on many occassions to help with the stiffness I was feeling. After doing this dvd for two weeks I'm a new woman less pain and able to get the range back in my legs.,1320192000,2,220,3.8043478260869565
8365124,5,B002DGS0R4,"I was skeptical at first, but after giving it a try I can now attest that this video has changed my life. If you want to learn how to PERMANENTLY rehabilitate your body, then I urge you to purchase this video now. It gave me complete knowledge of my injury, taught me how to check my range of motion, and provided me with 3 week stretching regimen to return my bones to their natural resting place. Results were immediate. I could actually feel my blood rushing, and muscles releasing just after the first set. I didn't have to check my mobility to know the stretches were working. After completing the program I was compelled to write this review. This DVD's knowledge is too valuable to not shout it from the mountain top. All physical therapy scools should include this DVD in their curriculum. In fact, we should teach our children how to properly care for their muscles. We teach them how to brush their teeth, wash their body, and care for their diet, why would we omit muscles and bones? Buy the DVD, complete the program, then pass it along!",1291075200,6,1049,4.526315789473684
8365125,4,B002DGS0R4,These DVDs are very good.  Worth the money if you follow through with the exercises as directed.,1282780800,2,96,4.647058823529412
8365126,5,B002DGS0R4,"The DVD is very well organized.  It has a Introduction, Stretching Principles, Education and enough information that you can do a self diagnostic so that you know what stretches will work for you.  It was very easy to navigate.  The DVD also had easy/beginning stretches to start with, and then more advanced ones when you have worked on the first few a few weeks.  All the stretches were demonstrated very well.",1248912000,15,412,4.76056338028169
