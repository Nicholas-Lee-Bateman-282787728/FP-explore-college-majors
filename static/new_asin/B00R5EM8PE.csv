6899114,5,B00R5EM8PE,"I am TOTALLY hooked on this show! I have the original Teen Titans complete series on DVD. Honestly, I like the original show better b/c Robin and Starfire do get romantically involved. That's 1 thing that pisses me off about Teen Titans GO!--->Starfire CONSTANTLY rejecting Robin, & the fact that Robin is ABSOLUTELY stupid and arrogant. I LOVE the Beastboy and Raven pairing though!",1429488000,3,383,5.0

For fans of the show, this DVD is definitely a must have.  If you haven't checked out the show yet, do it!  It isn't like its predecessor; but is a hilarious, silly, fun show that is mostly acceptable for all ages.  I highly recommend both this show and DVD.

6899145,1,B00R5EM8PE,"In this new box set of these multi-colored idiots, we see Robin Raven Starfire Cyborg and Beast Boy partaking in their usual stupidity and mindless behaviour. Cyborg demonstrates his cowardice and uselessness in ""Slumber Party"" where he allows his teammates to be devoured by a hideous creature named Scary Terry. Poor Raven and Starfire are devoured by this beast in such a horrible manner that i literally barfed as i watched them being eaten and digested by this vile thing. As I said of Cyborg he is a coward and he is completely useless. Robin of course behaves like the arrogant backstabbing cheating twit that he is. Beast Boy is beyond stupid. Anyway this show makes picking out and socks and watching paint dry exciting by comparison. I give this rancid excuse of a show 2 thumbs down! The original Teen Titans show was far better than this worthless piece of junk! (In memory of Raven and Starfire who died horribly in the jaws of Scary Terry..they are gone forever but they shall live on in our hearts for eternity...)",1431216000,3,1029,4.722222222222222
