8649148,2,B00J9VJF02,This movie just didn't do it for me.  Snooty NY socialites and a Native American princess.  Sounds good but it all sort of falls flat.  At least it did for me.,1504569600,,159,4.064516129032258
8649149,4,B00J9VJF02,"Because wealthy Michael plans on marrying a stenographer, the family feels disgraced and sabotages the marriage. The jilted girl commits suicide, and Michael vows revenge against his family. He sees his opportunity when he meets Tonita, an Indian who falls in love with him. He marries her and takes her home to meet the family and exact what he believes to be the perfect revenge. This is a cruel plot with a lot of cruel characters. If theres a moral, its that the white man is contemptible. Silvia Sydney is beautiful and accomplished in her role as Tonita. The plot moves quickly, and the film  becomes more interesting  the further into it one gets. Although an odd story with cruel intentions as the focus, the film is well worth viewing.",1492300800,,744,4.7153846153846155
