5686192,5,B00C25352Q,"This is a very entertaining series on all manner of subjects including the paranormal, ancient and modern mysteries, etc. I always admired Sir Arthur C. Clarke for his open-minded approach to everything even though he was cautiously skeptical about the material on the show. Sure, some of the subjects have been updated with new information since this show aired, but nonetheless it still has a lot to offer. Video quality is quite adequate. You can choose to watch all episodes or select certain ones on the menu page of each disc. I recommend this to all fans of unknown mysteries and of course, the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke.",1393027200,,628,4.770642201834862

5686194,5,B00C25352Q,"I remember watching this program when I was a kid.  Haven't seen it on TV for quite awhile and after searching numerous DVD stores and searching online for a U.S. version, I finally gave up a few years ago.  It was after finding the ""In Search Of"" DVD set that I saw VEI made a US version of Mysterious World!

5686195,5,B00C25352Q,"This show goes way beyond pop culture novelty like Bigfoot, UFO and Ghosts, to phenomenon that you may not have been aware existed before seeing this program. Clarke finds historic artifacts, witnesses and compelling materials to help us analyze the reality of these subjects.  His explorations are balanced and his summation clearly thought through.  At the end of every program, he shares his opinion about the realities, and gives us an educated guess about the unsolved mysteries.  This is a great and entertaining collection.",1384560000,13,530,5.285714285714286
5686196,5,B00C25352Q,"In late 1986, when I was 14, my father bought a 10 ft. satellite dish, the old days before you had those tiny dishes like DirecTV or Dish Network. Unfortunately 1986 was a time when many of the satellite channels were becoming scrambled, most particularly premiums (HBO, Showtime, Cinemax), but at least the then-new Discovery Channel wasn't one of them (unfortunately even that channel became scrambled a little later on). I really missed the early Discovery Channel since there were only commercials ran every half hour. This was the short-lived days when the Discovery Channel was using a map logo (in 1987 was when the very familiar sunset motif logo was introduced). One show I very much remembered was Towards 2000, an Australian science and technology series, which naturally morphed into Beyond 2000, which viewers are much more familiar with. Another one of the shows from those early days I enjoyed was Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World, which was originally aired on British television back in 1980 on ITV (actually Yorkshire Television, but they were a division of ITV). It seemed to cover a lot of similar ground to In Search Of... over in the States, although Mysterious World only lasted 13 episodes, while In Search of... lasted six seasons. Stuff like UFOs, the unexplained and paranormal, sea monsters, and other subject matters that can't be fully explained. Clarke might have been a skeptic but not a diehard skeptic, he did state he did see a bunch of UFOs, on the other hand, he really likes to see solid proof to be convinced. Nor did he subscribe to the Erich von Dniken school of thought where if it can't be easily explained, it had to be aliens intervening (I can imagine Giorgio Tsoukalos saying something like that on Ancient Aliens). I really enjoy the narration from Gordon Honeycombe, which gave it an ominous feel along side the frequently ominous music from Alan Hawkshaw (who apparently done a lot of studio session work as well as lots of albums under his own name through the years). Through the years the Discovery Channel continued to air the series, but eventually they thought the series would more appeal to American audiences if they replaced Gordon Honeycombe with an American narrator, and an attempt to make it ""less 1980"" by replacing the text that described the location (which was diagonal and yellow in the upper left hand corner) with a computer generated version.

Until now, the only way you could get the series on video format in the States was to get the 1989 six volume VHS set from Pacific Arts Video (a company that was ran by Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, of all people). A DVD set was made available in the UK, so unless you have a compatible DVD player or region-free DVD player (or live in the UK, naturally), you wouldn't be able to use that set. Now VEI Entertainment, based out of Canada, came with a set called The Arthur C. Clarke Collection. With that set you get Arthur C. Clark'e Mysterious World (1980), Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers (1985), and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe (1994), but it's nice to know that you can buy them separately, in case you already own a copy of Mysterious Universe (which has been available domestically for years, both on DVD and VHS), or you can play the UK version of Mysterious World (I don't believe World of Strange Powers had been made available on DVD previous, but it was available on VHS).

What you get here is all 13 episodes of Mysterious World on two DVDs, but there is no bonus material. It's nice to see these episodes again the way they were meant to be before the Discovery Channel decided to ""modernize"" and ""Americanize"" this program. Each Episode even ends with the ""Yorkshire Television"" banner with that trademark ""Y"" that looks like a ""V"" (although the Yorkshire Television intro with the horn fanfare interpretation of the Yorkshire folk song ""On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at"" that begins each episode was omitted, probably do to property rights of ITV). I have to say the picture quality is rather good for 1980. I go as far as saying the picture quality is better than the In Search Of... DVD box set that VEI also made available. Probably because the film was better preserved. I only wished the cover art was better. I wish that the package showed the Crystal Skull of Doom (that was owned by Anna Mitchell-Hedges) rather than a dinosaur skeleton, since seeing the Crystal Skull open up every episode was what made my day when I was 14 and still does to this day (of course you get to see the Crystal Skull intro on the DVD). I am also glad to own the DVD of Mysterious World, because I own a couple Pacific Arts VHS tapes of various episodes and the quality of the tapes have deteriorated so bad it's practically unwatchable, but then they were used when I bought them and it's hard telling what kind of abuse they went through. Now for you US and Canadian residents, you can now finally get to enjoy the series on DVD, which means this purchase comes highly recommended.",1381363200,15,5019,4.702272727272727
5686197,5,B00C25352Q,got it for an excellent price. Arthur C Clarke is and was one of my idols.  Brilliant man and very very quick to investigate anything thoroughly.,1378252800,3,145,4.576923076923077
5686198,5,B00C25352Q,"Chances are, you've heard the name Arthur C. Clarke before; if you haven't, you owe the man a debt of gratitude.  After all, he invented the communications satellite!  Clarke was a genius and have an amazing imagination to boot.  In a twist of ingenuity, he decided to incorporate both into a trio of series' that investigated the fantastic.  The resulting shows influenced millions of viewers all over the world during their air-time.  I'm happy to report that this complete set of shows is now available on DVD for the first time.

I am so glad they decided to release these.  I had heard of these shows but never had the chance to check them out.  They definitely live up to the hype I had heard, and I am glad I can now share them with my children.

Each show is shot well and includes exposition from Clarke himself.  This gives an almost one-on-one air to each episode and therefore strengthens the draw that each has on the viewer.

I particularly enjoyed the Mysterious World series.  It is filled with numerous concepts and possibilities that are still highly discussed today.  These are also the basis for a wide variety of story ideas as well.

ARTHUR C. CLARKE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION is a must-have for science-fiction buffs of all ages.  Whether you are young or old, you're sure to enjoy this set.  The collection is available now, so give it a look for sure.",1375315200,27,1375,4.619834710743802

5686222,5,B00C25352Q,"I watched these episodes when they were on the Discovery channel in the early 90s. The video quality of the 2 dvds was excellent, better than seasons of In Search Of (which I bought all six seasons of). Not coincidentally I've also read at least 20 of Clarke's books and I know he was generally skeptical of the subject matter, but he was certainly not closed-minded. I strongly recommend this to anyone who liked the show or is interested in the subject matter.",1453161600,4,462,4.578313253012048

5686224,5,B00C25352Q,"Loved these series way back when, especially the first one. Clarke was always right on the money with these shows, taking a middle ground between the supernatural/strange explanations and science. He was a skeptic, but an open-minded one. So that alone moves these series to a higher level than more credible stuff like In Search Of (which was still great, of course).

Good video and audio quality, especially for the era and considering that shows like this aren't exactly candidates for any sort of cleaning up or remastering. Lot of content here for the price, too. Highly recommended.",1449964800,,589,5.010204081632653
5686225,3,B00C25352Q,I got this mostly for the novelty of hearing Arthur C. Clark talk about woo woo science.  It's a blast.,1448496000,,103,4.15

5686234,4,B00C25352Q,"Interesting subjects still, although some subjects covered are a bit repetitious.  I finally received a good working and viewable set after having to return a previous set and waited on purpose for awhile to purchase a new one.  The first set had 3 episodes that would not play and in some cases I thought the quality of the pictures was a bit on the soft side, but the impossibility to play 3 episodes was the main reason for return. I noticed however that in this set also, that in the beginning of each episode, when they introduced Arthur Clark and mention his accomplishments, it was mentioned among other things  that he is the author of 2001 and later, also in the NEW disc set that I received, when in the later episodes an different lady introduces these accomplishments, he is the author of 2010 !  Not such a big deal of course, but I thought when I received my first flawed disc set that this was also an indication that something was wrong with the transfer of the disc in addition to 3 episodes not playing.

Minor observations now that this new set I received is of very decent quality considering the age of the films when they were taken.  So, any body who likes these types of documentaries, this is still a worthy set to add to your collection but check for the little imperfections that some discs might have and don't hesitate to exchange them if it bothers you. Hopefully you don't have to and thus enjoy it.",1438387200,5,1430,4.480769230769231

I can watch them over and over and not get tired while others can watch the current tripe and manure on what used to be documentary channels. Thank You!",1411689600,4,249,4.208333333333333
5686256,5,B00C25352Q,"This is very well packaged and has all the adventures of Arthur C. Clarke's paranormal series. The shows are in the style of a scientific documentary. You won't have to wade through a lot of stupid sound effects, shaky cameras, and people running around in the dark. It calmly takes us through the various topics of UFOs, crypto-zoology, ghosts, disappearances, time shifts, etc.. The subjects are seriously presented with a definite skeptical bias, as you would expect of anything created by Clarke. It is an older video, so don't expect the newer supernatural reports. The reproduction and quality are excellent.",1408147200,12,614,5.15

8576404,5,B00C25352Q,"Back when the X Files was in first run. Or even before that, when Twilight Zone crawled over the airwaves, shows like A. C. C's Mysterious World were slipping between the cracks. They stretched the programming beyond Sit Coms and disposable detectives. With Mr Clark himself serving up the weirdness there was a creepy credibility in these stories. It was a kind of documentary deliberately designed to make you think and wonder about long after the show was over.  And the best thing about it is they still do!",1507593600,2,511,4.741573033707865
