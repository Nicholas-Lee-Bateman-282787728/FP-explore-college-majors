Buying in a UK market I would not expect or wish to buy something that was not appropriate and it should have stated this product was region 2 in German. A very dissapointing waste of money.",1503532800,,283,4.2592592592592595

8484307,4,B005RJ0R8Y,"Ok, this is an old movie, when sound was still fairly new.

And this was one of Cary Grant's first films (pardon the acting)

There was also the regrettable performance by Sylvia Sydney as Butterfly.

One must bear with all of these, because this little  gem holds an amazing secret ;

Cary Grant could sing and do I mean sing!!

Check out this incredible baritone aria he sings with emotion  in  ""Madame Butterfly"".

Can't Top this one!",1432425600,3,437,4.571428571428571
