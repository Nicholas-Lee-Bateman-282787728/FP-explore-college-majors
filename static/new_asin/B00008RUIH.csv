7986651,2,B00008RUIH,"This starts off as good.  Really good information about how to hold your hand for the picks to work, very good rhythm chop.  Everything else is annoying.  His rolls make absolutely no sense once you get past the actual roll.  A roll pattern is supposed to include as many melody notes as possible in it, that is how you choose which roll to use.  His version of ""may the circle be unbroken""  is just a bunch of foreward rolls with no syncopation and no relationship to the fourth or fifth chord within the song.  Cindy cashdollar introduces the rolls in a way that makes sense in a song you could actually use in a jam.  After ""circle""  the next tune, he tells you that you need to start figuring out things for yourself.  If I have to figure it out myself, why do I need to pay you?",1463184000,,783,4.22972972972973
7986652,5,B00008RUIH,Actually I am still working on the first DVD.  But so far it is a 5 star.,1412121600,,73,3.2941176470588234
7986653,5,B00008RUIH,"I have talked to Rob and received instructions for free over the phone as we are from the same part of the country. He did this because he is a really nice guy and couldn't make time for me for quite a while because he was leaving the next day to go on tour.  Since, he did that for me and didn't have to I thought I'd pay him back by buying his DVD but he one upped me again. It is an excellent instruction DVD especially for the dobro!",1376784000,,437,3.8555555555555556
7986654,5,B00008RUIH,The two DVDs are excelllent and a great way to learn Rob's style of playing.  Almost as good as having a private lesson with Rob.,1362528000,,129,4.16
7986655,2,B00008RUIH,"This could be useful for beginners in terms of getting their bearings on the instrument, but several of the tunes aren't written in tablature, and there aren't that many to begin with. Most annoyingly he explains midway that he can't be bothered to  break a tune down note by note -- sorry Rob, that's what these are for. This is an expensive primer with not enough to justify the cost. You're much better off getting David Hamburger's excellent dobro workbook, with extensive tab and a CD. You'll save money and learn a great deal more.",1349395200,2,537,4.652631578947369
7986656,5,B00008RUIH,"Rob Ickes is a fantastic teacher! I would highly recommend this to anybody wanting to learn Dobro. It applies to Dobro players that are beginning, intermediate or advanced. Ickes does very well in explaining things clearly and going through everything. It comes with some great songs to learn too.",1258588800,,297,5.081632653061225
7986657,5,B00008RUIH,"To start if you are a beginner this dvd may be a little advanced for you, but I found it perfect for my intermediate skill level. Before I got this dvd, my dobro knowledge was essentially limited to some bluegrass melodies. Now i can play solos and pick apart melodies, in both blues and bluegrass situations. Rob is a stunning player and a great teacher. Well worth the $33 i paid.",1213056000,4,382,4.394366197183099
7986658,5,B00008RUIH,"To preface any comments I have about this DVD, I am a huge Rob Ickes fan.  Any dobro player should model himself after Rob's for technique, clarity, and ubiquitous playing style.  Rob starts with how to tune by ear, a good practice for any instrument.  He then discusses in detail the techniques used first with the right hand, then with the left.  He covers these very well.  He then goes on the incorporate these techniques into songs.  That is were I think the DVD lacks.  Rob picks some pretty difficult pieces right off the bat.  I've only been playing for four months, and I'm doing fine with this DVD, but many may get discourage quickly.  A few, ""Down in the Valley"" and ""Go Tell Aunt Rhodie"" songs to start off would have been nice.  He gets into rhythm chops and shows his variety, the muted strum, as well and the bar lift chop.  The first DVD ends with his techniques for forward and reverse slants and how to use them.  The second DVD dives into blues scales and finishes with how to back up a singer, a dobro's main job.  I feel this DVD set is like many others, a very good teaching aid, but not a substitute for a good instructor.  If you're just starting out, you may want to wait a while before tackling this video. It is well worth the price of three private lessons ($45).",1114387200,16,1292,4.351464435146443
