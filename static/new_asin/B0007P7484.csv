8050303,5,B0007P7484,"This is one of a rare Star Trek TV episodes on Voyager that's worth viewing and collecting. It rates up to the level of the movies ""Generations"" and ""The Wrath of Khan"" and TV version of the Next Generation's ""All Good Things."" I really enjoyed all these movies. However I'm turned off by the constant commercials of the TV episodes and I'm about to discontinue watching and taping with all of the fast forwarding you have to do to avoid the deluge of commercials and hope to only buy specific selections. ITUNES does offer a limited selection of TV versions to download on your IPOD at $1.99 per episode. This would alleviate all the irritating commercials. Otherwise you'll have to buy the package deals offered at Costco or Sam's Club or some other outlet with episodes you dislike to avoid the commercials. Anybody feel me?",1192147200,,827,4.710344827586207
