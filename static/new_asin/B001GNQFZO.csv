8306307,5,B001GNQFZO,"I am so glad I found this because all of the other seasons of Spin City were so outrageously priced. This 2-disc set features many very hilarious episodes from the Michael J. Fox's 4-year stint on the show. From the pilot the ""Goodbye"" episode and everything in between, this is truly Michael J. at his best, and features some of the show's funniest moments. I never cared for the Charlie Sheen years, so this collection, though only bearing 18 episodes, will tide you over until seasons 2-4 come down in price. ""Spin City"" will keep your tummy rolling!",1452124800,,553,4.653061224489796
8306308,3,B001GNQFZO,"Good program but ruined by the obnoxious, never ending laugh track.",1426896000,,67,5.181818181818182
8306309,5,B001GNQFZO,"Michael J. Fox still brings a smile to our face.  Great value, comedy remains relevant.  It's great to be able to pop in some decent TV to watch with my family (older teens) that is relatively appropriate.  Definitely worth the purchase.",1293408000,2,237,4.7317073170731705
