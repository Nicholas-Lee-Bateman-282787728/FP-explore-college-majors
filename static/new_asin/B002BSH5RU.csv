8611194,4,B002BSH5RU,"I purchased this dvd for the interview with Kathryn Bigelow, and was not disappointed. I cannot imagine any other American director (either male or female) having made The Hurt Locker. In addition to all of the physical, technical, logistical and cultural challenges it presented, it was the work of a film maker with a very strong and distinct sensibility. This is an excellent interview, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the views and character of this uniquely gifted director, who has managed to create her own special path along the edges of the film world.",1279238400,,578,4.908163265306122
