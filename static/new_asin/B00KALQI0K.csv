8656954,1,B00KALQI0K,"Bought this DVD after watching on Crackle. It would seem to me that it may be bootleg, due to the sudden loss of sound and anti copy message on the screen. Look elsewhere to purchase",1443657600,,182,4.228571428571429
8656955,5,B00KALQI0K,"I absolutely love this series, but beware, *the disk I got wouldn't play in my XBox One at all*, so I suspect it won't play in any Blu-ray players. Fortunately, it does play just fine on my old 360, and it sure beats the awful Crackle streaming which seems to absolutely refuse to stay in HD...",1441065600,,294,4.267857142857143

8656960,5,B00KALQI0K,"I recieved this as a gift and this is by far the best show I've seen in years and its not even on a network channel! (Crackle) I was shocked and amazed at the story and acting and overall look and fell, I would diffently a fan and I sure hope they're more to come, I have seen season 2 has already been aired. When its avalible to buy if on bluray im most certainly buying! Dvd for 1st season isn't the best no features but its still worth it for the show i didn't want it to end even. Left me wanting more!  A++",1418947200,,512,3.876190476190476
8656961,4,B00KALQI0K,"The series centers on a couple of quirky hit women. Sort of like Violet and Daisy meet Smokin' Aces. The series is done quickly in a grindhouse fashion as they attempt to squeeze an hour's film into 21 minutes and 30 seconds. I enjoyed the characters, especially the odd relationship between Veronica  (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and Roxie (Emily Osment) a girl after my heart.

The plot could have been tighter, and I suspect this first series was done to establish character and relationships. Hopefully they will take the stories up a notch. In this tale a young boy who knows bank account numbers and passwords gets kidnapped. The story involves family double crosses and unlikely alliances.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity.",1411776000,3,735,5.008196721311475
