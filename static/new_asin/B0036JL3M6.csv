8390029,5,B0036JL3M6,I love this workout and it's one I find myself going back to again and again for it's high fun factor.  The set is bright and airy and the music is fun and upbeat.  The choreography is innovative and I was able to keep up with him well.  I love the funky taps and mambos especially.  This one always puts me in a great mood.  I highly recommend it!,1273881600,4,348,3.9855072463768115
