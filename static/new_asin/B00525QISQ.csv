8453533,5,B00525QISQ,"One of the best, if not the best, programs on the mysteries of the Great Pyramid. Particularly interesting were the mathematical and geometric relationships that were explained. This documentary covers many of the incongruities and current mainstream explanations that are, for the most part, very unconvincing. It is obvious to this reviewer that we have been looking at the Great Pyramid from the wrong angle. The Pyramid Builders operated in a different world paradigm. This documentary makes a good attempt at trying to unravel it.",1482969600,,535,5.305882352941176
8453534,5,B00525QISQ,"Perhaps as many do, I have questions and doubts regarding the Pytamids. I found this movie to be very reinforcing of many ideas, beliefs, theories etc, when it comes to bad history. I think there is a chunk of history missing from our textbooks. I think the explanation of these stone edifices is lost in that chunk of history. This thought provoking movie makes me want to dig deeper into the subject. I am not locked in to just one path of thought.",1447891200,2,450,4.433734939759036
8453535,4,B00525QISQ,"I watched this on YouTube and it was incredibly fascinating. There are actually two versions, one narrated by actor Brian Cox, and another narrated by a woman with a thick European accent. The video is exactly the same for both, just the narration is different. Absolutely worth watching. It demolishes the ridiculous theories put out by conventional scholars. When you see the part about all the worldwide ancient sites being laid out in a straight line you will say ""Why haven't I heard about this before?"" and ""Why isn't there more research on this?"".

The other reviews all complain about the same problem, which is that the DVD is region-coded and can't be watched on American players. A few years ago my wife visited Moscow and brought back a DVD of a movie that hadn't been released yet in the US. We were able to watch the disc on her laptop, which allowed you to change the regional code in the media player. So there's one solution, if your computer has the capability to switch settings.",1445731200,8,998,4.670454545454546
8453536,1,B00525QISQ,I did not know before buying this product that there are codes for each region of the world and that I would not be able to play this DVD in any of my players. As this is my fault for ignorance I can understand. But I do think a warning should have been applied to the sale to keep customers loyal.,1375920000,4,298,3.901639344262295
8453537,1,B00525QISQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this on YouTube; hence, I ordered the DVD. My address is in the United States (Region 1 for DVDs also includes Canada, Bermuda, U.S. territories); but lo and behold, they sent me a Region 2 DVD (Europe, Middle East, Egypt, Japan, South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Greenland, French Overseas departments and territories).

Um, I'm a little dumbfounded . . . or I've just been ripped off. Sending it back. If I don't get the correct region in return, you can bet I'll add a scathing review of the vendor.",1373932800,4,530,4.760869565217392
8453538,1,B00525QISQ,"The english version is a fake... the english version as been modified.
Look only french version on you tube or buy french dvd edition at amazon",1367366400,4,143,4.538461538461538
8453539,5,B00525QISQ,"DVD did not play in two different Sony BluRay players.  I had already seen documentary and ordered for my library.
The DVD I received appeared to be used even though I ordered new.  I returned.",1364083200,3,193,4.485714285714286
