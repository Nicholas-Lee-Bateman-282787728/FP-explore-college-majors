8325345,5,B000KGGNLY,"I'll be the first one to rave about this show.  My husband, my son and & I just can't get enough of if.  Every time we tune in we are amused, educated & entertained.  But $20.00 per episode?!?!?!?!  Give us a break, Discovery Channel!!!!  Though we love this show & thoroughly enjoy watching each episode again and again, why should we consider purchasing even our more favorite episodes (like ""Sinking Titanic"" or ""Falling Penny"") for $20 a pop when we can watch them for free as they are re-run on The Discovery Channel all the time???  Offer them in a complete season set for even $60 or $70 and I might consider it.  If not, well then this is one family who will just have to content ourselves with enjoying this show whenever it just happens to be on........for free!!!",1165190400,11,774,4.485714285714286
