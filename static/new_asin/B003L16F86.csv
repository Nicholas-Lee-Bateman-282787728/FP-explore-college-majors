8399172,3,B003L16F86,"If you accept this as a low budget b-movie it becomes much more tolerable. Holding it up and comparing it to the original movie which this one is based off feels unfair. This movie introduces characters who have no relevance to the original plot and does very little to tell us about the origin story of ichi beyond what we already knew: he's a mentally disturbed sad sack who just got bullied to much.  Furthermore the tie in at the end of the movie feels downright lazy.

On the plus side, some of the characters (as irrelevant as they are) are rather amusing and the movie has some interesting  avant-garde sound and visual special effects which truly pay homage to Takeshi Mike's style.  The violence is uncomfortable at times though there doesn't seem to be as much love in their punches due to the limitations of a low budget. The cinematography chose to be interesting instead of good, which makes it unique if nothing else. A good watch for anyone who wants more of the violence they loved in Ichi the Killer and are willing to excuse some low budget issues.",1417305600,,1066,4.56544502617801
