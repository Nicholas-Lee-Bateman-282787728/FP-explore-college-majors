We started watching when the show started, being a fan of post apocalyptic entertainment.  We have yet to be let down by this show!  The characters continue to grow and develop.  The story line keeps you interested and wanting more.  If you take the time to do more than just kinda watch this show, you will discover very complex characters, development, emotion, and societal truth.
Very strong show!  We love it!
Oh, and the little bonus toy,... score!",1463616000,2,484,4.714285714285714
