7834609,2,630300198X,"I'm a big fan of Bill Paxton and John Hurt, but even they couldn't save this movie from the lame plot and dialog. (By the way, there is no monolith in this movie; I have no idea why they called it that!) Worth watching only if you're shooting for the goal of seeing every movie that Bill Paxton has ever been a part of.

One star for Bill Paxton, and one for John Hurt. (Sorry, Louis Gossitt Jr, you're not on my fave list.)",1425859200,,424,4.0476190476190474

7834611,2,630300198X,"I expect bad acting from Bill Paxton, and Linsay Frost, but acting was quite awful by everyone...something I wouldn't expect from Louis Gosset Jr, or from John Hurt...at least not always, so I have to assume the responsibility lies with the director.
  as if women don't make it hard enough for men to play the romantic game, threatening to break an arm if one is ever called cute again is just plain stupid and no doubt further make real life more miserable by other females copying such ludicrous examples of maleffemininity.

the premise was ok and in a sense supports the theory that some UFO entities are demonic, something few people seem to want to accept in preference to the concept of ""space brothers"". The show might have been a decent except the flaws just kept detracting from the flow.

There was constant forced anger, poor dialogue and illogical reactions and excessive forced emotions constantly displayed... again no doubt the fault of the director. yet oddly no fear was acted out... odd when you consider real life sighting examples how fear often takes over in similar circumstances. And the editing was pretty bad too as occasionally links to next scenes were tenuous.

The show might have been ok were it not for constant attempts to destroy it with poor acting and illogical actions, and flat humour. I'll be glad to give this movie away.",1354665600,,1362,4.803418803418803
7834612,5,630300198X,"This lovely little piece of the B movie genre returns to the basic formula of a mismatched cop team against the evil conspiracy and the ultimate evil alien life force. What makes it fun to watch is the startlingly high quality of actors cast in the piece. From Bill Paxton to Louis Gossett jr and on, the actors play their parts earnestly in the face of galactic cheese. John Hurt's magnanimous performance as a homicidally lunatic master conspirator adds spice to the movie that a lesser actor would have merely delivered flat. Watching Paxton and Lindsay Frost work each others nerves leaves the question as to whether Frost's character is really gay and is planning on going bi in order to bed the disreputable Paxton. This is not high art, it is a burger and fries and a good laugh on a friday night. I highly recommend this movie not for its vaunted script or artistic content (although kudos on its artistic license with reality;)) but for the fact that when you're in the mood to watch something and can't figure out what this is the movie you will reach for over and over and over again;) Comfort food for you movie fix!",1228953600,6,1128,4.561576354679803
7834613,3,630300198X,"What is it with these enormously talented actors like JOHN HURT, who was so good in ""The Elephant Man"" and ""Alien""?  Why would he overact so shamelessly in this 1993 almost B-movie sci-fi thriller?  His big finale scene is so over the top it makes Vincent Price look like a deflated balloon.  Whereas Price knew just how far to go, Hurt takes his demonic villainous role and shoots it to the stars.
Otherwise, this pre-X-Files fantasy suffers from a ponderous script, slack direction, and not enough time with the alien.  Bill Patton, who is always willing to be the true maverick anything, spars deftly with Lindsay Frost, and their comic timing helps the duller moments.  I particularly liked Paul Ganus in his role as the bespectacled villain.  Behind his corporate glasses, lurks a giant of a man, obviously beefcake material.  However, when his moment comes, he is beat to a pulp by Paxton and then whines when he realizes an elevator is going to chop off his head.  What made Ganus so interesting was the cool aplomb he displayed, and his bulky threat behind the Armani suits.  Lou Gossett, Jr. tried hard, but his role became so stereotypical, it muted his performance.  The scene on the skyscraper could have been more chilling, but back in the early nineties, CGI hadn't been introduced so it's obvious they're on a scrim with a blue screen behind them.
But heck, this is so much better than a lot of these films, it's worth a rental.",1073952000,3,1443,4.690476190476191
7834614,1,630300198X,This is  a horrible movie. The plot is something about a killer alien that can't be stopped or something. We've seen this before. The stars of this movie no one has heard of and the dialogue was laughable. Watch the scene of the alien being chased in a hotel and laugh your head off. Don't see this movie  unless u have 2.,996192000,,322,4.17741935483871
