7851733,5,6303584780,This is one of those rare films that make you smile in total delight the entire time you see it.  Clair captures the mood of a French  provincial town in the early fifties with such mastery!  The characters and the situations they become involved in are great fun to watch; the actors are all perfect in their roles.  Gerard Philipe is here as charming as one can possibly be; his virtuoso acting seems rather effortless.  Gina Lollobrigida plays a lovely Arab girl with a fresh sensuality that makes our heart melt. This film deserves be released in DVD format.  And URGENTLY!,1169596800,8,577,4.663366336633663

Consider these variables: A industrial town and a young music teacher. His boring life will take a new twist when his fantasies of her female love affairs become figures from the history. With this original script, the outstanding good taste and talent of this director and the presence of the unforgettable actor Gerard Phillipe imagine the odds. The whole result?: a supreme masterpiece and one the great treasures of the French Cinema.

My favorite film of Rene Clair!",1117238400,15,581,4.979381443298969
