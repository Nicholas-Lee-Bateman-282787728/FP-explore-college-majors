8584064,5,B00COQU0GC,"Sticking my neck out here -- but this is a great movie. Jack Nicholson has such a 200 watt personality, it's easy to overlook how smart he is and what a great writer he is. Here, he's a great director. (In the DVD extra, Bruce Dern gives most of the credit to the AD. But I suspect Nicholson had something to do with it.) Story in a nutshell: basketball star at 1971 University of Oregon screws professor's wife, drives ahead with his career, watches his radical friend (who's trying to avoid the draft) slowly shatter like a glass goblin. No didactics, no big point, no takeaway lesson. The movie unfolds in the Cassavettes-inflected American take on the New Wave style. Like, raw, real. Look closer, and you'll see the cinematographer, editor and cameraman had great eyes for composition, pace and flow, and the apparent chaotic flow of life ain't no accident. The acting is decent, not over the top. Karen Black, Bruce Dern, Henry Jaglom, etc. -- an ad hoc acting troupe associated with Rayburn Productions of Monkees fame/infamy. This movie stands with ""Five Easy Pieces,"" ""Easy Rider,"" and the rest. Why no love from the critics? I suspect, because they hate jocks.",1508112000,,1170,4.768472906403941
