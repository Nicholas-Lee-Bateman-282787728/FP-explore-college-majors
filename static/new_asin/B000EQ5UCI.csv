8113155,3,B000EQ5UCI,"In terms of informational content this DVD is useful for those with little or no knowledge of the vehicles. For those with more knowledge than the novice, however, not very informative. The information contained in this DVD is something that anyone who has even a rudimenatary knowledge of the vehicles (i.e., say that contained in ""Sturmgeschutz III and IV 1942-45"" and ""New Vanguard 019 - Stug III : Assault Gun 1940 - 1942 "" (both published by Osprey and about 60 pages long)) would know.

With respect to film footage, it is primarily from German newsreels. Despite this it does show the development of the vehicle over its lifespan fairly well. There is footage from all stages of the war and nearly all fronts (with the exception of Norway and Finnish fronts). The vehicle is shown from its early appearance in the war, where it was used as an infantry support vehicle, to the end of the war where it served primarily in an anti-tank role. The film footage also covers the vehicle in these various roles showing how actually operated, in combat, in these roles. The only real weakness of the DVD is that there is almost no footage (about only 15 seconds) of the version equiped with the 105 mmn gun (which was used primarily in the infantry support role).",1261353600,4,1261,4.68018018018018

8113157,4,B000EQ5UCI,"'Stug III & IV - Assault Guns' is a very well done video. The film covers the entire operational history of the Stug on all fronts although North Africa is barely mentioned and the majority of time is devoted to the Eastern front.

Most of the video footage was new to me. The footage seems to come from German progranda films although I'm not sure if it is one film or pieces of film. I suspect the latter. A few maps were added into the footage. The narration is new and not from the original film and is very good and reasonably clear. Sound is minimal at best.

The video provides general operational details along with some specific actions and details on the various versions. Interestingly the 105mm StuH42 is not mentioned at all even though it is shown a lot. The Stug IV is barely covered. Other equipment is briefly shown in action such as the 20/37/88mm AA guns.

Overall it is well done. The narration provides only basic data but the footage is great for the modeller, wargamer, and armor enthusiast. Lots of good footage of the Stug in action in all weather and all terrain.",1160092800,13,1089,4.48989898989899
