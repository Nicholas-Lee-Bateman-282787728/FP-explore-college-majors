5584418,5,B00BEIYP1W,"This could so easily have just been another race movie, like 'Days of Thunder' and appealed to the petrolheads exclusively. However, with Ron Howard at the helm and a tremendous true story to work from, this film was simply brilliant.

Rush follows the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl). Two men who are poles apart in their approach to their chosen profession but both driven by the same ultimate goal.
Understandably, there is a degree of dramatisation of the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, including the fabrication of events that never happened and omitting certain interesting facts: such as Hunt and Lauda shared a flat in London early on in their careers.

The chemistry between Hemsworth and Bruhl is brilliant. Hemsworth's portrayal of Hunt was excellent and there wasn't a trace of his native Aussie tongue in his upper-crust English accent! Bruhl as the clinical Lauda was nothing short of perfect and both lead actors performances made for compelling viewing.

Perhaps having an American at the helm led to a more balanced film as Hunt and Lauda were both portrayed as very human and flawed characters where it would have been so easy to simply portray them as mere stereotypes; and I was glad that neither man was characterised as the villain of the piece.

Although I commented that this wasn't a film just for petrolheads, I don't think F-1 fans will be left disappointed. I was particularly impressed by the race scenes and the authenticity of the film in general, capturing the essence of the mid-1970s beautifully. The story itself is intelligent with a touch of humour but due to the subject matter, is also exciting and times deeply dramatic. The tragedy that befell Lauda is dealt with admirably and in unflinchingly real fashion. Lauda himself has commented on its portrayal in this film. Additionally, Rush does not shy away from Hunt's use of drugs, failed marriage and also sensitively narrated his passing.

I'm not a fan of Formula One or motor racing in general but to date, Rush is unquestionably my film of the year.",1380326400,4,2095,4.923512747875354
5584419,5,B00BEIYP1W,Ron Howard's RUSH is absolutely amazing. It caught me way off guard. Wow! This is an amazing film. It is high powered. It is excellently acted! It has energy in every aspect of the production. This may be one of the best race car movies ever made. It is thoroughly captivating and you never want the adrenalin rush to end. It is a must see film in every respect. A quality production in every respect. It blew me away.,1380153600,4,418,4.30379746835443
5584420,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Those were director Ron Howard's words as he described the setting of his new film, RUSH - a fast-paced, colorful, energetic, adrenaline-filled, and excellently acted racing drama that some critics are are saying has ""the greatest car racing scenes ever shot on film"".

Prepare to be surprised at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chris-Hemsworth/dp/B0099RFVXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chris Hemsworth</a>'s toughest and most meaty role yet - that of womanizing, fast-driving, fast-living British racer James Hunt. Hemsworth gives an entertaining and emotional performance, showing his range heretofore limited to smashing things with a hammer (which is still totally cool...). Accomplished young actor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Bruhl/dp/B002YCVX5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Bruhl</a>&nbsp;steals the scenes as the calculating, analytical, brilliant driver and Hunt's personal rival, Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer give quality performances, and like most of Ron Howard's resume, the film is excellently cast.

The big focus here, though, is on the all-encompassing, deadly rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, which played itself out on race tracks all over the world. And guess what? The critics were right. In my opinion, it's *inarguable* that RUSH has some of the FINEST racing scenes ever shot. Filled with gut-clenching action and edgy cinematography, these set pieces are engrossing and fast-paced, and shot with a brilliant technical eye. Hans Zimmer's typically awesome score helps some, too. With clever camera tricks and brilliant editing, the audience is put right in the centre of the action - right in the cockpit of Hunt's Formula One race car. The noise is visceral and pulse-pounding, the driving is nail-bitingly tense, and the crashes are spectacular and terrifying. For added realism, Howard and his team used real cars for the races.

Technically brilliant, RUSH is period-accurate (prepare for awkward hairdo's) - capturing that frenetic fervour of the 70's that made Formula One racing so popular. RUSH's cinematography is Howard's best since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apollo-13/dp/B001JI72AI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apollo 13</a>, and the camerawork is stylish and kinetic, but the film is not without drama. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is emotionally played out with surprisingly excellent acting.
Cons? The plot isn't really as original as it might hope, and still succumbs to many common tropes of sports movies - the training montage, the television broadcast to keep us up to date, etc.

But RUSH is a formula (pun intended) film running in top gear. Like a sports car, exterior is shiny and good to look at, though under the hood it is strong and well-oiled. The acting is surprisingly good, and Howard's typical technical brilliance and period accuracy is on full display here. RUSH should be a tremendously entertaining time at the movies, both for racing and car enthusiasts, and also for the casual viewer. This is a Formula 5 Star film!",1380153600,7,3146,6.031319910514541
5584421,5,B00BEIYP1W,"The first full-length movie Ron Howard ever directed was ""Grand Theft Auto."" Since then, he has built a storied, award-winning career; now he has come full circle to another auto-racing film. This biography is based on the true story of an Austrian Formula One champion and his British arch rival. I found it thrilling, involving and highly entertaining.

We see:
  * Daniel Brhl (""Ladies in Lavender"") as three-time Formula One champ Niki Lauda, a buttoned-down technocrat, friendless and charmless, but a brilliant analyst who understands all the elements of racing: the track, the engine, the body, the weight, and above all, the competition.
  * Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") as handsome James Hunt, exuding the joie de vivre of international success. He revels in the booze, the drugs and the women that go along with fame and is always the darling of the press because he is so quotable.
  * Olivia Wilde (""The Change-Up"") as Suzy Miller, soon to be the famous supermodel Suzy Hunt, who swans into Hunt's life and quickly marries him, much to their mutual regret.
  * Alexandra Maria Lara (""Imagine"") is Marlene, who marries Lauda almost on a whim, but who remains in his life as his staunchest friend and ally.

Howard gives us a soundtrack that shakes the theater as those powerful engines roar into life, but never neglects the dialogue: We hear every single spoken word in a script where much of the fun is what our two rivals say to (and about) each other. Their top-notch competition brings up the game for both, so they come to realize they need each other. Lauda says, ""I learn far more from my enemies than from my friends.""

We already know from reading about this film, that neither one dies in any of the horrific crashes we see, so this isn't a spoiler, but I found comfort knowing in advance that despite treacherous rainstorms and challenging race tracks, these guys still will be with us in the final frame. I always want someone to root for!

5584556,4,B00BEIYP1W,"This could have been a great movie.  The racing scenes are great, and Hemsworth's portayal of the troubled but hard charging playboy Hunt was brilliant.

What drove me crazy was the decision to portray Niki Lauda as an angry, joyless, tactical race nazi.  I'm surprised Ron Howard didn't have him wear a leather swastika coat and walk around with a german shepard (yes I know he's Austrian and yes, James Hunt had the german shepard).  But seriously...for viewers who know a fair amount about racing a Formula 1, this will be jarring.

It's true that Lauda was socially awkward.  It's true he was a merciless race strategist and car setup tactician, and it's true that he did not believe in racing when conditions were too dangerous.  But the movie seems to gloss over Lauda's absolute dominance of Formula One at the time, having won the World Championship in 1975 and was ""lapping the field"" in 1976, winning 4 of the first 6 races and finishing second in the other two.  By the time the pivotal race and crash in Nrburgring, Lauda was so far ahead on points the crown was really just a formality.  He was an amazing driver, and went on to win two more World Championships.  None of that passion shows in Howard's portrayal.

Also ignored (to make the storyline work) is that Lauda and Hunt were actually friends off the track, and talked often about the tradeoffs in strategy and tactics for both of their racing styles.  Lauda envied Hunts freewheeling life, Hunt envied Lauda's discipline and commitment. There's a brief scene at the end that show both (real) drivers leaning against a pit garage wall, talking, and even in that brief clip you can see both the connection and the mutual respect both drivers have for each other.

So sad that the director chose such a one-dimensional way to portray Lauda.  It ruined the movie for me. Maybe for non-race fans it won't.",1516924800,,1873,4.6880733944954125

5584561,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Following suit with the dual character protagonist/antagonist utilized in both Frost/Nixon (2008) and The Dilemma (2011) where the audiences own consciousness determines who they side with, director Ron Howard executes this motif superbly in one of his finest films. The historical drama about two rivals doesnt aesthetic look like any of Howards past films  yet under the lens of cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantels extreme scope, Rush carries the same incredible energy as Howards masterpieces(Apollo 13; A Beautiful Mind; Cinderella Man) and indubitably deserves to be classified as one of them. Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) clash in a way thats accessible to any professional field Rushis beyond the rookie level of simply having dedication to your dreams, its about how you execute yourself. Are you the studios type or the party animal?Is one more healthy than the other?

5584683,4,B00BEIYP1W,"This movie is based on the true story of the rivalry between drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the 1976 Formula One season.

I am not a racing buff, and have never enjoyed watching people turning left endlessly on TV. However I did enjoy this movie. It is hard to talk about it much without giving away the plot, but suffice it is to say that Rush is a well directed movie with a solid story and worthy performances from both Chris Hemsworth as partyboy Hunt and Daniel Br&uuml;hl as serious-as-a-heartattack Lauda. The contrast between the characters only serve to highlight and intensify the highs and lows both drivers go through in a season filled with spectacular triumph and devastating tragedy.

While the story is only about 75% accurate, it is nonetheless as realistic as possible due to the involvement and input of the real (and still living) Niki Lauda. Lauda rejected numerous overtures from Hollywood to make a blockbuster movie based on his 1976 season but finally gave his consent to a script, director, and cast he deemed worthy of retelling it nearly four decades later.

While I enjoyed almost all aspects of the movie, I thought that the pacing could have been better as it does get slow while developing the personalities of the characters. This is ironic, as pacing is probably the single most important aspect of racing from what I understand - more important than stepping on the gas with a lead foot and just as important has having the best tech on the track. Even taking a star off for that, this movie delivers what its title promises and should appeal to a wide audience.",1496620800,2,1607,4.711743772241993

I watch this film from time to time and it never disappoints.  That said for those who are doubtful, it is not my typical genre by a long shot.  It is simply an engaging, well made film that highlights the marvels of Formula One racing in its early days.

And then brought the reality of this sport that had claimed the most lives in pursuit of the limit, it infront of the national audience to play out and to see who could claim the top spot. Well crafted though I'd prefered a little more time about the actual race,s but then it would of been the length of le Man's...

5585076,5,B00BEIYP1W,"This is a true work of Genious art. No one but Ron Howard was able to gather the best members to make this kind of best of the best car racing movie possible. RON HOWARD(DIRECTOR of THE DAVINCI CODE,  THE BEAUTIFUL MIND, RANSOME, BACKDRAFT, COCCOON, A BEAUTIFUL MIND and 39 films) , HANS ZIMMER (MUSICIAN of BLACK RAIN, THE DARK NIGHT, RAIN MAN, THE LION KING, TRUE ROMANCE and 176 movies) Anthony Dod Mantle  (Cinematographer of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, 28 DAYS AFTER, DOGVILLE,  127 HOURS and 52 movies>  Daniel P. Hanley, Mike Hill(EDITOR of 37 gorgeous movies).
They are the dream team and the result is unbelievably artistic eye poping piece of work adrenallin pumping pop music video art like movie you will never forget that you will watch it again and again.

It is way better then <DAYS OF THUNDER> or <FAST AND FURIOUS series> for sure.

The story is simple about this two rival. They are even fight in dreams. Bun when one is injured brutally, the other is painfully helping with all his heart. Support with his mind.
Even when the guy is recovered and came back to the Grand Prix, he looses the game just to let the guy win back again once and for all.

Thinking back car is the dream for all man.
The pure beauty of it's look, the sound of the engine, the smoothness of it's color and metal line of it.
Just to pollish is to make us so happy. No?
And then the race? You have no ida.
When I was in La, when I was able to run more then 160 per hour some times, I really felt free totally.
That's why these guys are taking their life on this game.

There are so many shots that are so so artistic and this movie won so many editing awards from all around the world and they deserved more.
Also the cinematography was a work of art itself if you will see, you will definately say wow what a job.
No other movie is even close to this one at all.

The sound and music is unbelievable also even though this is not 7. sound it is enough for now since it is DTS HD and that was enough for me although two speakers were resting at that time.

Especially the rainny day scene was amazing for me and you will love it so much too.

Two main actors are so lovable. One is kind of a playboy typle and the other quite all into game type. Both in their own way perfect.

Watch it or you will never have a chance to enjoy the true life at all.",1469059200,,2334,4.185267857142857

5585172,4,B00BEIYP1W,"On August 1, 1976, Niki Lauda was involved in an accident when his Ferrari hit an embankment and burst into flames. Lauda was trapped in a searing inferno until he could be pulled out. In those few minutes, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled toxic fumes that damaged his lungs. Six weeks later, still with bandages and against doctor's orders, he was back racing. This is a movie about the rivalry and close friendship between flamboyant playboy James Hunt and Niki Launa. Fans came to Grand Prix events to see these two championship drivers, who challenged the other to be in his peak form with the utmost respect. This admiration evident when Niki attempts to take James under his wing, giving him advice about how he can improve his performance. Imagine that, coaching your greatest opponent about how to up his game and increasing his chances to claim the trophy. James could compartmentalize his private life's antics (parties and having a good time) before a race and concentrate solely on the task at hand. The extreme inherit danger are not conducive for the longevity in the sport that James had unless he was clear-headed at race time. One source of distraction he had to put out of his mind was the publicized marital discord with his wife, Suzy. She divorced him to marry the famous actor Richard Burton (who had an earlier marriage to Elizabeth Taylor). Burton paid James $1 million in the divorce settlement.",1464652800,,1436,4.794354838709677

The two could not be more opposite in style and personality (one a Brit and the other an Austrian). Ron Howard's touch is evident in the development of the movie as it builds to the end of the story, which is particularly engrossing if the audience (like me) is not familiar with the story and events. At the end of the movie Howard inserts video of the real life characters, which I like when the movie is about real people, and in this case it is amazing how similar the actors look to the actual characters.

5585680,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Loved this movie.  I enjoyed its many layers and fascinating stories within a story. It's a must for F1 fans and anyone who likes a well-told tale.  Buckle your seat belt and get ready for an exhilarating ride full of twists and turns about an epic rivalry and survival against all odds. Transported back to the 1970s, you'll absorb the essence of F1, feel the thrill of the chase as Lauda and Hunt try to outdo each other race after race, and silently mourn and question the tragedies on the track.

The movie embellishes a few things to enhance the drama and tension but nothing that detracts from the film or its overall accuracy.  The movie plays up the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt while hinting at their mutual fondness and respect.  The pacing was great and I was impressed by the actors. Chris Hemsworth really captured Hunt's charisma and drive, along with his immaturity and off-putting arrogance. I had only seen this Hemsworth in Thor trailers and thought he was just another ho-hum, wooden pretty boy.  Not after this.  Daniel Bruhl was perfectly cast as Niki Lauda and did a terrific job.  It was fun and incredible to see him/Lauda transform almost instantly from a serious driver without much popular appeal into a charismatic F1 personality after he literally got back into the driver's seat just a month after his horrifying crash.

I spent hours after watching this movie researching how it matched up with the truth (very well even down to appearances), the lives of Hunt and Lauda before and after the time period in the movie, and finding more F1 movies to watch.

Now if only I could give a lift to a stranded Lewis Hamilton so that I can say, ""my car is your car,"" and blast past traffic.

If you want something to watch after ""Rush,"" I highly recommend the documentary ""1 The Movie,"" narrated by Michael Fassbender. http://www.amazon.com/The-Movie-Formula-One-Blu-ray/dp/B00GNZM0B8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8. It puts the period covered by ""Rush"" in historical context, especially in terms of F1's safety record (shamefully dismal then). The progress in safety once F1 started putting real money and research into it is incredible. This movie makes you appreciate how far the sport has come while serving up spectacular old racing footage.",1445817600,,2272,4.984126984126984

5585813,5,B00BEIYP1W,"RUSH is probably the best racing movie I have ever seen.  I loved this film from start to finish.  It has a more realistic feel to it than say ""Days of Thunder"", but not the drag or monotony of ""Le Mans"" or endless  different track shots of ""Grand Prix"".  The film seems very balanced I loved the story of the rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt.  I knew nothing about Formula 1 racing in the 1970's.  I, like most Americans am more familiar with the Indy Car Circuit.  I grew up in the 1980's watching guys like Mario & Michael Andretti, Al Unser Jr, Bobby Rahal, Danny Sullivan,  Arie Luyendyk etc etc.

Ron Howard made a beautiful film about 2 men who risked everything to win and the dangers of racing cars at the top level of the sport.  This film is so much better than the disastrous ""Driven"" by Sylvester Stallone or any other films about open wheel racing.  I thought it would be hard to top Ron Howard's last great film ""Cinderella Man"" but I think he succeeded with this picture.

The actors who portrayed James Hunt ""Chris Hemsworth"" and Nikki Lauda ""Daniel Bruhl"" did a marvelous job portraying the characters of the real life drivers.  I would have given them academy awards for either lead role.  The realism of the acting comes across very nicely; I am sure the real drivers did talk trash and swear at each other quite a bit in the heat of the moment.  Driving cars at 180 to 200 MPH and the slightest mistake could cost a driver the chance of winning a race or possibly dying.

The scene where Lauda calls the Ferrari he just got done driving a S***box was hilarious.  The movie has lots of little moments like that which are humorous.  The stars of the movie are also the cars themselves.  The film actually used all the real vintage cars.  Most of the drivers actually kept the real cars as keepsakes and some even race them still today.  It is always nice to see the real thing on camera instead CGI graphics.  I would highly recommend RUSH to any race car fan or general action movie fan.  The film is also full of very beautiful women throughout which are easy on the eyes to say the least.  The pace of the movie is very good. There is no real dull moments in the movie, all the dialog advances the movie.  It will be hard for some viewers to see the hospital burn scenes but they do seem pretty realistic.  I have seen the film 3 times now and enjoy every minute of it.

Originally when I saw the previews for the movie it looked interesting, but a buddy of mine who is a big NASCAR fan talked me out of going to see it.  Just goes to show that you should always trust your instincts I ended up really enjoying the movie.  The movie does not have as much track footage as a movie like ""Grand Prix""  or ""Winning"" both excellent films, but it hits all the right notes.",1441670400,2,2798,4.304597701149425

5585896,1,B00BEIYP1W,"I did not see the movie in the theatre and had debated whether I wanted to see it.  I'm an F1 fan since the very early  1960's.  Finally, I bought a copy, watched it once and then threw it away.  I now see why it was advertised as a movie about racing that people who had no prior interest in racing could enjoy.  This one was all about the dialogue and the interrelationship ( supposedly) between Hunt and Lauda.  It is a remarkably good portrayal of Lauda's character and bluntness.  But, they were actually much better friends and rivals than this showed.  I was terribly disappointed in the racing footage.  Mostly computer generated.  Sorry folks, entities like Pixar can do wonderful things with animated movies, but for serious racing enthusiasts who loved Lemans  ( probably the best of all racing movies) , Grand Prix ( others will argue it is the best)  , Winning , Red LIne 7000 (even), this one does not do it.

Rush is a greatly over rated movie.  As a movie - it's no better than three stars; however as a racing movie - two stars.  Grand Prix and Le Mans are still the best racing movies.  They tower above the very slow - Rush.  You can add a star for the very lovely T&A.",1435622400,,485,4.528735632183908

Two men from completely opposite ends of the spectrum with only the common desire to be the best race driver ever.  The story is accurately retold in this movie, with the attention to detail evident throughout.  It simply is a great story of personal competition, wrapped in the strength of will to face constant danger and the emerging respect for the other guy.

5586057,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Being a cynical bastard, and a life-long fan of motor racing since a kid in the late 1950's , I'm always sceptical of any attempt by Hollywood to make a motor racing movie . In this case, however, I'm impressed and Ron Howard is to be congratulated. Despite taking a few liberties with reality, and historic fact, in some early scenes this is a film that does very well .

Having known James Hunt, for a while in the early 1970's,and having gone out with one of his several cast-off girlfriends, I can confirm that Chris Hemsworth's portrayal is convincingly accurate....!!!  Daniel Bruhl is peerless as Niki Lauda and I loved Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda.

The use of locations is entertaining. I was highly amused by the use of Britain's Cadwell Park and Brands Hatch circuits as substitutes for Crystal Palace , Watkins Glen and the Nurburgring . A wonderful dramatization of a departed era of motor racing history.",1435190400,,927,4.745341614906832

5586203,5,B00BEIYP1W,"The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes.

The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian ""professor"" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt.

The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense.

The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life.

The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred.
After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail  although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then  and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash).",1431907200,,1590,4.35472972972973

But I really enjoy Formula 1, and I appreciate a good character drama.  Even better that it's a bio-pic, based on real events.

You don't have to be a Formula 1 fan, or a fan of racing in general, to enjoy this movie, although it doesn't hurt.  This is a character movie, the story of two competitive race car drivers in the most heated year of their rivalry.  It feels real.  Every time you start to drift into thinking the movie is a fictional creation the movie pulls you back with gritty, realistic portrayal of real events - complete with tube televisions showing broadcasts of the time.

The movie was well written and directed the acting was superb, Hemsworth did a great job portraying Jim Hunt. Niki Lauda was portrayed very well also. This film gives you a feel of the lifestyle that they had there were times I felt like I was watching the real deal.  The race scenes are outstanding probably about the best if they are not number 1 then they are number 2 all time IMO.

I love the look of the old school F1 cars they look like masterpieces. I also admire the bravery and skills the drivers had the cars had less technology back then so it was more about their skills.  Never a dull moment if you are a fan of motor sports and rivalries you will enjoy this movie.

5586827,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Ron Howard is an exceptional director and I think one secret of his success is that he makes entertainment his first priority.  That is certainly the case in the movie Rush which does not have a dull or dry second in the entire film. This film about a British playboy Formula One champion and his rivalry with a perfectionist Austrian driver is classic drama as two men with completely different world views and approaches to life each use their strong suit in a dangerous competition. I say that their personalities and world view are completely different and yet both men have a touch of psychopathology which sets the stage for dramatic confrontation throughout the film.

 Austrian driver Niki Lauda is played by the intense actor Daniel Brhl. Lauda is a scientist and perfectionist in his passion. He has complete mastery of all aspects of racing including the amount of risk he is willing to assume that he will wreck or be killed. He calculates risk rather than instinctively jumps into it. He has a bit of the characteristics of a man with autistic characteristics since he has absolutely no social skills and could care less how he treats his fellow man or woman and the responses he stimulates during these negative interactions. He is able to shut out external stimuli so that he can concentrate on his goals and his craft. Then someone special comes into his life and this makes for a more rich drama.

Chris Hemsworth plays reckless James Hunt. He is a complete amoral playboy who is self centered, sarcastic, self assured, daring to the point of crisis, and on the prowl sexually at all times in all places.  He drinks alcohol like a fish as made evident in a good many scenes in the film.

Olivia Wilde plays Suzy, the international supermodel and wife of James Hunt, who offers some of the most penetrating lines to her husband as their marriage falls apart. Alexandra Maria Lara plays the wife of Lauda. All her lines are in the first half of the movie since in the second half of the film she is pictured as continually loyal and worried about her husband.

The film explores how competition brings out the worst and the best in human beings. It is to the credit of Lauda that he perfectly understands this. The screenplay is excellent and even though many of the lines are spoken under adverse racetrack conditions, the viewer hears every line. The film is intense as two critical races are conducted during downpours of rain, adding to the possibility of crash and death. I highly recommend the film. It is well constructed by Ron Howard so the viewer is never lost sequentially or chronologically. It will keep you on the edge of your seat far more than most current films.",1422144000,,2694,4.6828752642706135

This movie had very little racing, mediocre acting at best, and some of the worst special effects I have seen in a ""recent"" movie.  It was honestly nothing like I thought it was going to be.  My wife and I watched it with high hopes. I tried to like it, I really wanted to like it but I would honestly never watch it again.

Lived thru the 70's but never really watched racing.  Jackie Stewart, Chris Economaki, Mario Andretti, Al Unser... I'm done.  Oh wait Danica Patrick later but that counts right?

Back to the movie. Didn't even know this was based on a true story when I first started watching.  And even though I saw the star rating, I was still skeptical.  This was not your typical sports movie with the Hollywood clichs, Rocky music etc.  Characters drew you in to the story.  Very well performed.

5587228,4,B00BEIYP1W,"A fine film; F1 fans who remember those days should be entertained by the high level of accuracy and the excellent portrayals by Messrs Hemsworth and Bruhl. Non petrol heads will find the drama, rivalry and mutual respect a good story that is not necessarily about motor racing.

There will always be those who object to some detail or another but this is after all a dramatization and not a documentary; it conveys well the atmosphere at race tracks in the 70s, a time when the garages did not look like operating theaters as they do now and a time when there was precious little fencing and other protection for spectators but mainly, of course, there were almost no devices within the cars or around the track to protect the drivers.

I particularly liked the use of Gimme Some Lovin' over the first racing scenes, inviting comparison and contrast with Days of Thunder. There were other nice touches hidden in the script, the use of Lord Hesketh's reason to step up from F2 to F1 being a good example.

I too would have preferred less CGI but I can't see any other way of reproducing those shots on a finite budget.

Overall, not quite as good as Senna but good entertainment for a wider range of viewers.",1419552000,,1208,4.552995391705069

5587495,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I love this film. I think I've seen it well over 10 times, and I'll watch it again and again. Great story, great cast, great sound. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is amazing -- love the cellos. From comparing photos of the real people and the actors, they did a nice job of casting faces that fit. I've never followed Formula 1 racing, but I think we've all heard of Mario Andretti and McLaren and Ferrari -- and now we know about Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Filming a docudrama is always challenging; I have to say, nicely done, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. I think Chris Hemsworth captured the character, but really, Daniel Bruhl was far more than a supporting actor; they share the story as equals. It's key to listen to the race announcers to keep track of the timeline, but that doesn't detract from the story if you miss a date. F1 is still a dangerous sport, and drivers do get killed, even with advanced safety precautions.

It's also a reminder of the era and world we come from. When I was a kid the world wasn't expected to be safe. Whether it was the insane dangers of F1, Evel Knievel's crazy risky stunts, or just the no holds barred type hard hitting American Football. Risk taking was allowed, and honestly encouraged. Even as kids we did crazy things, no helmets or pads....just that thrill of taking the big chance. We wanted to live like our heroes on the edge. The absurd lengths we now impose on all sorts of sports for safety were simply not there.  That era, those men, we may not see their like again, well not outside of the military anyway.

I watched it twice that night and purchased it from Amazon (my absolute GO-TO place to buy anything,  now) (No i didn't get anything for saying that. I tell everyone I know when I find a good thing. Amazon Prime is the bomb! I know I will get the thing in 2 days, and the price is cheaper on most everything I buy.) The movie RUSH,  is far more dimensional than I expected. First, its a true story about two unusual race car drivers. The film is fast paced,  gives one a real sense of the danger and the consequences of an accident,  while exploring the character of these drivers and their relationships as well. It also deals with the tremendous ups and downs of professional racing for the driver,  the crew,  and the owners with regard to the economics side of racing.  Its as dangerous to make a mistake on the business side as it is on the driving side. I was always a Mario Andretti fan. The film takes place during his career. He IS in these races.

This is a breakthrough film because no director, even the esteemed late John Frankenheimer, has mad a well balanced, exciting racing movie with well developed characters and good balance between track action and off track interpersonal drama and romance.

Sadly, during the last few years of his life, James Hunt would have been
ashamed as this movie only shows the hotheaded, woman chasing, money
wasting side of him. Later on in life, at his lowest, he would meet a woman
that would change James Hunt forever and make him regret his playboy days.
Niki was pretty much a dead on character too. The F1 cars in the movie were
the real ones from the period, borrowed from their new owners. I thought it was
really good :)  There was one thing they skewed for the movie that I didn't think
was that great, but it wouldnt make as good of a movie had they followed real

The racing scenes were great. The tension of the 1976 season with the great comebacks of both Hunt and Lauda. You can see the dedication of Lauda,when he criticizes the god like Ferrari and challenges Louis,Stanly both stalwarts of F1 racing. Reggazoni is portrayed as the passionate romantic of,F1 which he was. He said he'd be happy in a last place,car as long as he was in F1! Other drivers,are ignored but there is only so much time in the movie. I cracked up with the scene where Lauda is hitch hiking and is involved with his future wife and his Italian fans!! Down side. There is some incomplete history and untrue happenings which were modified,for,the movie. He sketch ran Dastle F3 cars not a Lotus 59. Lauda did a year driving for March in F1 where he took the bank loan to buy his ride not BRM who,did hire him for,his,driving skills. BRM had 3 drivers in1973, they forgot JP Beltoise the 1972 Monaco winner for BRM. These few lapses in history does not detract from this excellent film. And oh yeah, Bernie Ecclestone has a cameo.

Too much racing and you lose the the competitive feeling between the two principal characters. Events, some footage and results are factual; it is a history and story of the passion of racing.

5588005,5,B00BEIYP1W,"It's odd, but while watching ""Rush"" (R), I kept thinking about the film ""Bottle Shock"" (BS).  After all, R has women, and BS has women.  BS has competition -- fellow winemakers, and even sons and fathers, were duking it out -- and so does R -- a couple of racecar drivers willing to die on the track for a victory.  BS has a blond, long-haired hard-drinking protagonist, and R has, well, a blond, long-haired hard-drinking protagonist.  BS is based upon a true story -- the filmmakers poured all of the life out of the real story, however -- while so is R -- I don't know how true this film was to actual events, however.  And there is a very similar tone in both films.

But while there are some similarities, there are some huge differences as well.  One of those differences, and perhaps the most important difference of them all:  ""Rush"" is a really good movie while ""Bottle Shock"" is, well, total BS.  Yes, ""Bottle Shock"" was a total misfire.

But ""Rush"" is the opposite -- it fires on all 12 cylinders, or at least eight depending upon the car -- and it reminds me of a realistic ""Talladega Nights"" as well.  While that comedy was certainly funnier, this docudrama is certainly better.  The driving is pretty incredible here, and there are times where you might feel as if you're a passenger in the car, screaming along at 170 MPH.  Even some of the overhead shots are spectacular.  If you are looking for a theme, I'll give you one while giving you an old clich, but a clich that is often true and holds in this film as well:  ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.""

I will admit that I'm not much of a race fan; while I live a half hour from the Sonoma Speedway driving at 80 miles per hour, I've never been there as a spectator.  And I rarely watch car racing on TV either.  I do have a hard time accepting that race car driving is a sport, even though I do understand that the limits of humans are pushed just like the limits of the cars on the track.

Even though they're different genres, why does a movie such as ""Rush"" work while a movie such as ""Bottle Shock"" fail?  Well, it goes all the way back to the writing.

5588085,5,B00BEIYP1W,"""Rush"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: The true story of two of the greatest rivals the world has ever witnessed -- handsome English playboy James Hunt and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Niki Lauda. Set against the sexy and glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing, Rush follows the two drivers as they push themselves to the breaking point of physical and psychological endurance, where there is no shortcut to victory and no margin for error.

The cast led by Chris Hemsworth (in a solidly-crafted performance as James Hunt) & Daniel Bruhl (terrific as Niki Lauda) is excellent. The directing by Ron Howard (also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Peter Morgan (also produced) is excellent.

The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent. The cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is excellent. The film editing by Dan Hanley & Mike Hill is excellent. The casting by Nina Gold is excellent. The production design by Mark Digby is excellent. The art direction by Katrina Dunn, Patrick Rolfe & Christopher Wyatt is excellent. The set decoration by Michelle Day, set dressings by Katia Kandziora, Thomas Pax, Katja Schlomer & Benjamin Wiese is excellent. The costume design by Julian Day is excellent. The make-up effects designed by Mark Coulier (prosthetics) & Fae Hammond is excellent. The special effects supervised by Ulrich Nefzer is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Richard Clarke, Ryan Cook, Jody Johnson, Nathan McGuinness, Paul Riddle & Juri Stanossek, coordinated by Genevieve Claire, Joseph Lloyd-Pack, Mariana Mandelli, Sebastian Meszmann, Lucie Ostrer, Sophie Russell, Yvette Shum, Andrea Sjoberg & Donna Smith is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Frank Henson is excellent.

This is an excellent, well-crafted movie that is entertaining and interesting. It is also intriguing, as well. Ron Howard has directed another excellent movie that is as excellent as any of his previous films were. Chris Hemsworth is solid as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl gives a terrific and well-crafted performance as Niki Lauda. This was one of the best movies of the last fall season.",1407542400,,2112,5.224188790560472

5588352,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I don't particularly gravitate towards sports movies, primarily because I'm just not into sports but also because a lot of them are cliche-ridden underdog stories that have been done to death. Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try.",1405209600,11,2333,4.651331719128329

5588397,4,B00BEIYP1W,"After watching the trailer, I thought the film would get a best picture nomination from the Academy Awards; surprisingly this was not the case. Watching the film now, I express my bewilderment at this film not being nominated. It's a great film. Solidly filmed, and well scripted, this was a very well crafted biographical sports drama and I'll tell you why. My review of 'Rush'.

'Rush' tells the tale of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), as two highly skilled race car drivers, who form a rivalry that lasted from 1970 to 1976. James, a stubborn, dimwitted, and slacker, and Niki, a smart, calculated jerk, face off against each other to win the Championship for the Grand Prix.

'Rush' is a very well handled racing film. What surprises me is that it is more character driven then actual race car sequences, something you hardly see in these type of films. This not only helps the tension level when the racing scenes do occur, but it helps make the characters more human than one dimensional figures just following a script.

The film was well written by 'Peter Morgan' who seemingly puts the characters first, and the stunts, and car's second. He balances both Lauda and Hunt's separate story arcs perfectly, keeping each of them in tune with the other, not giving one more screen time then another. Morgan develops his character's well, and the dialogue is un-cringworthy. He even makes characters likable even when they seem to not be, that helps to make the film more enjoyable.

The film is well handled by director 'Ron Howard' who has provided us with the likes of 'The DaVinci Code' and 'Apollo 13'. He handles the material he is given wisely. His camera work is impressive to say the least, especially during the racing sequences. We are brought into the action being put right in front of the racer, or in the vehicle... And the crash sequences... wow. Not to mention the climax of the film was eye widening beautifully shot, with the rain and all.

The film is lead by two impressive performances from 'Chris Hemsworth' and 'Daniel Bruhl'. Hemsworth gives his all, and ends up successfully giving probably his best performance to date as Hunt. He seems to have tons of fun as the character and it plays well on screen. Even better is the relative unfamiliar face Bruhl, whose name is familiar outside the U.S but rather unheard of here in the states. He is powerful as Lauda, his eagerness to win, and evil-genius like qualities are transferred to Bruhl successfully.

I do however feel the film get's to be a bit to much spanning for over 2 hours. I felt it had a little excess that needed to be trimmed off to make this a more straightforward film, as to help it not lag along so much as it did.

All and All, 'Rush' is a beautifully filmed, solidly scripted, and powerfully performed film from director 'Ron Howard' that's more about the characters then noisy racing sequences, which works well. B+ 4/30/14

'Rush' is rated R for adult content, nudity, language, drug use, and disturbing accident images. It's appropriate for teens and up.",1404691200,,3083,4.7388059701492535

5588400,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I watch a lot of movies and most are instantly forgettable after one viewing, just occasionally though, you watch one and at the end you feel like applauding. Rush is one such film, it presents a great story about two people you can really relate to and sympathise with. As to be expected from Peter Morgan, the script is brilliant and the repartee between Hunt & Lauda is very funny in parts, but by the end of the movie, the respect for each other also comes through. The acting is very good as well, especially by Daniel Bruhl. Nikki Lauda comes across as fairly unlikeable at the beginning, but by the end you have enormous respect for him and especially his courage in coming back after that horrific accident.

When I look back at some of the very mediocre offerings that made the Oscar nominations this year, It's a real travesty that ""Rush"" didn't even get a nomination, it's 10 times better than ""Gravity"" for example.

5588654,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I missed this movie in the theater but got to watch it on a digital download last year.  I just bought the Blu-Ray recently because I wanted to hear those awesome engines and sound effects in an uncompressed audio format.  I was not disappointed as the audio on my home theater system completely outclasses the compressed streaming version I had seen prior.  Watching the film on my PS4 with the Linear PCM audio option and it sounded like I was in the middle of a real racing event.

The audio is not the only awesome part though.  The film was shot digitally with the popular Arri Alexa camera. The video transfer is clean, sharp, and very detailed.  There is a unique color palette to the film that was applied to give the it a look of a movie from the era the story takes place in. The combination of this crisp high resolution image to the unique color correction make for a great looking film.

The story is interesting and of course based in reality. With Nikki Lauda being involved in the assistance with production, one can hope that most of what we see is true to life but I am sure there is some artistic license used. Regardless of the authenticity of every word or scene the movie plays out very nicely. It is story told from both sides, one from James Hunt played by Hemsworth, and other from Nikki Lauda's perspective played by Bruhl.  Both performance are great but Bruhl had the greater challenge in having to pull off an accent that is very close to that of Lauda's.  There are times where it might be nice to get into both characters personal stories deeper. These are the limitations though to a feature film when you are trying to service two characters both equally well in two hours and still tell the story. Despite the limitations of character depth the story is never told favoring one driver over the other.  Depending on who you are you will likely respect both men or favor one slightly. No one is made out to be a bad guy. Both men are presented with the positives and negatives of who they were in Blunt's care or are in Lauda's. They are both flawed with the irony being that if they combined personalities they would have balance and be a better person. Maybe that is why there was a personal relationship of respect that developed going beyond driver rivalry between them. They saw something in each other they wished they could have in themselves but realized they never would.

This is a great film and disc and I would highly recommend it.",1403481600,,2476,4.492204899777283

  as far as racing movies go , I can think of 6 I like. this won would rank 3rd among them. they are ""3"", ""dale"", ""days of thunder"", ""rush"", ""cannonball run"", and ""death race 2000"". now, 3 of those are real and 2 not. I like ""rush"" better than the real ones but less than the pretend ones.
  do NOT  mistake this movie with the 1992 movie, ""rush"" about heroin. that one wasn't any good but the racecar one is great.
  it was, in my opinion, on of but not the best movie of 2013.
  so, I say, if you are into racing of any kind, you should check out this movie. I could even see a couple watching this together. there is actually enough love to keep the women interested too. this is an all around good movie. the only ones I think who may not benefit from this are children.",1402617600,,1030,3.9804878048780488

In the end it comes down that every great champ needs a rivalry to motivate.  It also shows that just because you are an enemy on the track off the track you can still respect one another.  In fact my favorite scene is when Hunt hits the reporter who questions Lauda about how hideous he looks after his injury.  The two drivers that are the focus of this movie are polar opposites and that to me is what makes this movie so interesting.

5588730,4,B00BEIYP1W,"Ron Howard is a terrific director. Over the past few years he has delivered some of the best films in history. Yes ill say it, some of the best films in history. Just one look at his filmography would confirm it, the man has contributed a lot to the world of film for which I'm thankful. Last year was a rather slow year for him admittedly, but the one film that was released entered and left with a bang in theaters for all the right reasons. Rush is a great film, its about 1970's Formula One racing of all things, but the characters and the actors/actresses who portray them do such great jobs you are sucked into the drama and can't help but enjoy it. This is a fast paced, slick, action packed film. The cinematography is just great, with adrenaline pumping speed races and a story that is just full of drama, twists and turns, and excitement.

The story is about the real life rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two of the best speed racers of their time and ultimately form a bitter rivalry. Whats interesting about this film is seeing Chris Hemsworth (as Hunt) as a character other than a Norse God or a teen heartthrob. Don't get me wrong, his character is still a ladies man, but he does bring more to the table than just a pretty face in this story. Daniel Bruhl does a phenomenal job as well (as Lauda) in fact I believe he has a slightly better performance than Hemsworth, but since they both do so well its really just a win win. The real excitement of the film are the races themselves when these two get behind the wheel, especially the way they are filmed. Its exciting, its fast, its stylish, and its a lot of fun to see.

This is one film you definitely need to check out. I really enjoyed it and I am not a fan of racing personally. I thought I would not enjoy it and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The soundtrack is great, the acting is superb, the drama (though increased for dramatic effect as it is) is amazing.

To come back after such a wreck shows what those guys are made of. This story is one of the all time great stories in motor sports. As an F1 fan and Motogp fan I can truly say anyone must be a Lauda fan. This is a must watch. Racing movies don't usually turn out great. Lemans and Grand Prix are two of the exceptions. The story of this one alone makes it worth the view.",1401926400,,627,4.024
5588774,5,B00BEIYP1W,"While I have not been the biggest fan of Ron Howard lately. I love myself a good movie about sport. Some of the best stories on sports of course are done beautifully by Disney, but Rush, the story of a legendary Formula 1 rivalry from the 1970's was meant for an adult audience.

This film has everything you want a rich story of the famous rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt as they both collide one two different paths towards being the greatest in Formula 1 racing. The film gives us some of the best acting from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (OSCAR SNUB!), even an unlikely one from Olivia Wylde. A powerful score from Hans Zimmer drives this high octane drama making the movie feel a lot shorter than it actually is. The stories of both of these racers captures their own personal goals and ambitions beautifully and even though the story is far from over when the credits roll you are left satisfied with the film as a whole.

I have no idea why this movie did not get any recognition at the Academy Awards. Ron Howard in my eyes finally redeemed himself with 'Rush'. This is probably his best film since Apollo 13, and I think this is a movie that needs to be watched.

5588851,2,B00BEIYP1W,"This is the first film I've seen by Ron Howard that has no shred of humor or redemption.
Daniel Bruhl's much-lauded performance was as one-note as it gets; a constant scowl on his face that was tiresome and boring.
Chris Hemsworth only had to look pretty, with occasional one-liners that made him look clever. The script was complete telling the true story of ambition and wins and losses. There was no humanity is these characters, as written, and it came off to me as a couple of jocks who were obsessed with one-upmanship. The cinematography was very good, and, though it was totally snubbed by Oscar, the editing was superb.

Why Ron Howard allowed the film to be so grim and unpleasant escapes me. There's no discernable good quality in any of the characters, and I, quite simply, wasn't entertained or enlightened. Production values were generally high-level, but this film left me flat.

5588925,4,B00BEIYP1W,"When one first sits down to watch director Ron Howard's Formula 1 racing drama RUSH, the first question most people will ask themselves is, ""Who the hell are James Hunt and Niki Lauda?"" and for most of us who haven't the first clue about Formula 1 racing, it's a totally valid question. But over the course of just over 2 hours, thanks to some terrific performances by Chris Hemsworth (THOR) and Daniel Bruhl (INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, THE FIFTH ESTATE), and some fine directing by Howard, we learn a great deal about who they are, and why their rivalry was so important to the history of racing.

Taking place in the early to mid 1970's, Hunt is a gorgeous hunk of a Brit, able to charm the pants off of just about anyone he meets, particularly the ladies. Lauda is a self-important, supremely arrogant Austrian whose mouth gives him somewhat rat-like features. The only thing these two have in common is that they both want to race Formula 1. Hunt is getting by on his looks, charm, and natural ability, while Lauda is getting by on his smarts and his discipline. When they first meet to race, they instantly hate each other, but their abilities on the track are significant enough to start a great rivalry. When ladies get involved in their lives, again, they are opposites. Hunt marries the beautiful model Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and Lauda marries the loving and comparatively plain Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). Hunt blows off his marriage, but Lauda finds something of a peace in his. All their rivalries culminate during one race season where a dangerous race (one that Lauda tried to stop but Hunt rallied his fellow racers to allow to proceed) has Lauda crashing and burning all too literally. As he recuperates in the hospital, and watches Hunt gather up enough victories to possibly take the world champion title away from him, Lauda summons up the strength to get back behind the wheel for a pulse-pounding finale.

The film has a decent flow to it, and the racing scenes are among the most exciting and realistic in recent memory; a far cry from the gleeful vehicular insanity of the FAST AND FURIOUS films. Hemsworth and Bruhl give terrific performances, but the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired. This is a film about men in a man's world, like many of Ron Howard's films (BACKDRAFT, APOLLO 13), and the women in the film are shafted. The film never really fizzles because Howard is smart enough to keep the racing rivalry front and center to create tension, but it never really shines off the track nearly as much as it does on it since Howard can't really find a rhythm when both his leads aren't on screen.

RUSH is a well-made film with two terrific leading performances, but the scenes not between Hunt and Lauda off the racetrack have the film hitting the brakes.",1400198400,,2788,4.685714285714286

I have to say my husband and I were both disappointed after watching RUSH.  I was already familiar with the Hunt/Lauda story line.  The 2 lead actors were really very good and were the best part of the movie.  I guess I thought the dramatization of key events in the story were a bit over the top, like the filmmaker was trying  to add drama to an already dramatic story to keep the audience interested. It seemed the filmmakers were trying too hard?

I'm old enough to recognize Niki Lauda's name but was a little unfamiliar with James Hunt or the rivalry that existed between the two drivers.

5589030,5,B00BEIYP1W,"By  the way things are going, nothing will ever surpass 1966 ""Grand Prix"" as the best racing car movie ever (or at least the best FOrmula One movie ever made).

Anyway, 2013 ""Rush"" is simply fantastic. It captured the excitement of the 1976 Formula One season with reasonable accuracy and sense of action and drama. Acting was very good all around.

The move had close collaboration of Niki Lauda himself.

One can find endless minor discrepancies or absences, but the general idea was kept intact.

Examples of different things in the movie in comparison with real life:

a. Lauda raced Formula Two a lot before going to Formula 1. He did not jump to Formula One directly from Formula Three.

b. The movie does not show that team Hesketh won a race with James (Netherlands 1975)

c. The movie repeats the often mentioned error that Hunt needed a third place at Japan to be champion (if Lauda did no score). No. James needed a fourth place, since they would be euqla in points (68) and Hunt would win the title for having more victories (6 against 5).

But these are very small discrepancies that do not damage the whole.

I enjoyed this movie a lot, the best movie I watched in 2013 (in theaters).",1399507200,,1198,4.55607476635514
5589031,4,B00BEIYP1W,"""Rush"" is worth seeing, and that's different.  Fact is, racing movies are rarely worth seeing.  Soap opera plots, terrible race simulation, and an emphasis on catastrophe make most of them B-movie, bubble gum movies (some of which are funny and entertaining).  The only exception before 2013 that this writer can recall was 1965's ""Grand Prix,"" directed by John Frankenheimer.  It did have a soap opera plot, but it focused with remarkable effectiveness on a plausible Formula I campaign featuring an aging star's challenge by two much younger and bolder drivers, with much detailed observation of how motor sport teams work.  Made in the era before workstation graphics could simulate almost anything perfectly, the film featured extraordinary driving sequences, many of which were driven by the film's stars.

Ron Howard's ""Rush"" is a better film, not so much for the very effective simulation of actual racing conditions (though it is excellent at that, often far better than ""Grand Prix"" ever could have been), but for an impressive, well-written, and well-played depiction of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the 1978 Formula I campaign.  To effectuate the plot, Lauda is portrayed somewhat unfairly (Lauda, a three-time champion, was one of the greats, and is still active as a team manager).  But that's fine; this is fiction based on history, not biography.  As the fierce Lauda, Daniel Bruhl is marvelous, and manages to be an oddly sympathetic character despite a deadly competitiveness and technomaniac humorlessness that nearly get him killed at the 'Ring.  His courtship of Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) is weirdly charming, their strong connection and loyalty a surprise in a sport as notorious as Hollywood is for casual infidelities.

Chris Hemsworth was so right as James Hunt, a driver as vividly in the public eye in his day as Stirling Moss was in his, that I wondered if Hemsworth might be related.  Really the last of privately financed drivers (and of course Hunt didn't win his championship that way), he was a throwback to a pre-corporate sponsor era in Formula I racing, a sport considered as much romance as competition, and was fabulously deadly, killing one or two stars every year and injuring many more drivers horribly. It also often killed spectators, sometimes in large numbers.

The story, unlike most racing films, embraces the complications of team, friendship, courtship, and competition in a sport that has its roots in chariot racing in classical times.  Howard manages to restrain the ""announcer over"" style that makes a mess of so many sports movies (they start to sound like NFL highlight films).  ""Rush"" is not at all like that. I enjoyed all of the characters, and have seen the movie twice.  The conflict between Lauda and Hunt, in the fabulous milieu of motor racing, which was real and widely reported in 1978, was a great choice, forcing the whole company to attach itself to real things instead of to the usual romantic fantasies about racing.

However, to be honest, ""Rush"" is a film about a variety of Formula I racing that has entirely vanished.  For all this sport's reputation for deadliness, great former drivers like Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, and many others in the FIA, have over the past forty years recreated Formula I.  They've done this by making its tracks safe (there used to be trees lining the roadways, and spectators sat unprotected along the edges as well), vastly improving car safety, and finally excluding the ever-dangerous amateurs who used to share in the competition.  Despite those changes, the cars are far faster, and the crowds bigger by an order of magnitude. And yet, it has been twenty years since there has been a fatality in Formula I, a record far better than American football.  I'm not knocking Howard for making a film about another era, but one shouldn't take his incisive and wonderfully made movie as a depiction of where motor sport is today.  The romance of blood, the driver as matador, has faded thankfully into history.  Today, millions of people enjoy seeing their heroes drive faster than ever and live to race again next season.",1399507200,19,4147,5.004366812227074

5589068,3,B00BEIYP1W,"I liked the film overall. For those who care: this is one of only two hollywood movies that I know where the germans (austrians) actually speak german. Lauda is still on TV in Germany now and then, and the actor has had plenty of practice in copying the way he speaks. lauda is sharp and to the point in real life, made the quib about the ass being able to feel the road and forces being key to Micheal Schumacher.
I did not like that the film felt small at all times. no use at all of all the lovations tthe formula one visits. nothing daring at all in the movie about the last daredevils the world had left. tepid movie sex scenes, a slight but half hearted attempt to make some of the film look like private pictures may have looked in that era. however, not much attempt to make the era come alive.

The Film hinted but did not truly exploit the understanding that in the end it is Lauda that does not get it. just like schumacher was the height of boredom and Senna forever the heart of F1, so it was Lauda. Nobody cares about the times in racing. THeater is what matters. even a live F1 event is about the most boring thing imaginable, it needs characters, and clearly lauda has non (according to the film).",1399248000,,1213,4.251082251082251

5589072,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I actually ordered Rush from Netflix and it sat on my table for three months.  I was kind of up in the air as to whether I really cared to watch it or not.  I guess I couldn't figure out from the hype whether it was worth 2 hours.  And then this week, after staring at it for the 3,567th time on my table, I just said, to heck with it, and popped it in the bluray player, and immersed myself it what has to be one of the all time great sports films, and one just fantastic film in its own right.

First, the story is basically true, with some, but truly limited, license taken with the facts.  Hemsworth and Bruhle (did I spell that right?) are fantastic as two real life rivals James Hunt, and Niki Lauda... tremendous acting.  The racing scenes are outright spectacular...edge of your seat stuff.  I should have known it was going to be good as Ron Howard helmed this one, and he's made some great films.  Hans Zimmer's original score is pretty amazing too.

In the end Rush is about what it actually takes to be the best, and explores mans' will to win, at all costs.  I can't help but think that I have lived my life more like James Hunt, but I secretly rue that I did not live it more like Niki Lauda.  If you watch Rush, which I wholly recommend you do, I'd be interested to see if anyone out there agrees with me.  Sometimes it's all about doubling down on yourself, even if no one else will.

5589186,4,B00BEIYP1W,"It would be helpful but it is not necessary to have some background knowledge about James Hunt and Nicki Lauda who were racing rivals in the 1970's.  It is hard to make a biopic about two people but Ron Howard adds his dramatic flair and makes a film that focuses the mens relentless pursuit for the F1 world championship in 1976. While the two men did admire each other they were in real life complete opposites. This is what makes the Rush so watchable because Howard is able to add his knack for directing drama in to film about cars.
In my opinion the play of opposites worked a lot in making this film an enjoyable experience. Chris Hemsworth is James Hunt, loud, passionate and a risk taker who likes to party hard. Lauda is his opposite meticulous, fastidios and calculating the degree of dying to a percentage in a race ( He refused to race if the percentage was over 20).
The film begins in the 70 and thus Howards compresses 6 years of action in a 123 minute long film.
The movie focuses on the rivalry and the respect they had for each other and does have a few affecting moments such as the near death escape for Lauda in Berlin, and thus becomes the movies clear moral  winner but it is a scene at the end when the two men exchange their philosophies on life, we find a new respect for Hunt.

The cars, mostly borrowed from collectors, at staggering cost,  are authentic, and so is the swaggering style.  Watching, you are never unaware of the speed, the noise, the danger, and the thrill of the sport, which turns especially painful in the scenes involving Niki Lauda's accident.  The acting is adequate, the direction is workmanlike, but it's the cinematography and the cutting that will captivate you, and the macho nonsense will make you shake your head.

It's not going to take the  place of ""Gran Prix"" or even ""Le Mans"", movies that were made like 50 years ago. That fact is amazing. I was a little disappointed, and I only watched the movie one time. I know it was a valiant effort, but it didn't make it. The best racing pictures are made with the camera on the car, at the track.

5589314,5,B00BEIYP1W,"White-knuckle racing with tons of heart and a raging fire in the pit of its stomach. Like the similarly adrenaline-drenched ""Warrior"" before it, Rush does an excellent job of evenly pursuing its dual leads, examining both to such lengths that we have ample reason to pull for each in their climactic showdown. Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival. An excellent, impressive blend of moods that touches many nerves.",1396828800,,1159,5.105263157894737

In the beginning I was like OK I want to see it because Chris did a nude scene ""yes I'm shallow...whatever"" then I got into the movie and was so wrapped up in it that I was shocked when it was over. Great casting and the cinematography was awesome, you could feel yourself in the drivers seat, and I've never been a fan or racing ""it's such a waste of fuel"". This was such a great film I did something I have not done scenes ""The Red Violin"" and that tell friends that if they buy it and don't like it I'll back it back from them (only on Blu-Ray  as this is a Blu-ray worthy film). and this is the first time in a VERY LONG time that I wish a movie was another 45 minutes longer.",1396569600,,840,4.029940119760479

That was the beginning of the rift between Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda.  I have two complaints concerning this movie.  First, that the fighting between Hunt and Lauda didn't happen the way it was shown in the movie, in fact it didn't happen at all. Second, the movie left out all of the North American Races, Long Beach, Canada, and Watkins Glen.

My dad was such a huge Mario Andretti fan that I barely knew the sport existed prior to his years of dominating the track, so it has a very historically accurate feel. The part of the movie where Niki Lauda meets his wife was so nicely assembled that I show it to my 14 year old daughter and she laughed (but even with THOR cast in the movie it seemed too ""factual"" to keep her attention beyond the little humorous action segment.)  The only reason I didn't give it the ""5th star"" was it lacks clarity in a few parts (or maybe I didn't pick up on some sub-text??) but over all it is worth seeing if you like action/drama movies that are meticulously shot.",1396396800,2,687,4.204545454545454

Sparks fly, and a fiery crash at the Green Hell Nurburgring nearly takes the life of one of them.  Based on the true-life rivalry between Englishman James Hunt and Austrian Niki Lauda, with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (The Bourne Ultimatum) as Lauda.  With a paltry (by Hollywoods standard) $30 million budget, director Ron Howard filmed on location with minimal computer-aided imagery, employed vintage F1 machines when possible, and sought the advice of F1 drivers.  Coupled with with an unerring eye for authenticity, Howard has produced a stunning recreation of 1970s-era F1 racing, with near-perfect stand-ins for Hunt and Lauda.

Cramming a 16-race season into a 122-minute film, however, makes Rush seem, well, rushed.  That said, the movie is a winner.",1396396800,,923,5.375

We were eager to see this movie because we were sitting on the track at Nurenburgring (sp) during this race.  We saw the burnt car being carried away and learned later that Niki Lauda was the driver.  I remember being very interested in the performance of the 6 wheeled car that was being tested.

Nevertheless, the characters are really interesting but by taking on two distinct personalities at once, it doesn't seem to get at the heart of either of them. There are a lot of parallels between the two characters but they are also complete opposites. I would like to have known more about each of them. The supporting characters don't get enough attention so you don't know much about them.

The racing scenes are really fantastic and literally put you inside the car.

This is definitely not a typical sports formula movie - upstart comes from small time, takes on bloated champion, loses professional and personal bout, makes comeback, wins - there is some of that, but the championship isn't necessarily the point of this movie.",1396396800,,832,4.770833333333333

""Rush"" perhaps does as good a job as Steve McQueen's LeMans.  Certainly the actors are more present in Rush than in McQueen's great film about racing.  Unfortunately, for those of us who have put our butt in a car, who have experienced even a moment of that bolt of lightening... It's still a movie.  The Hunt/Lauda rivalry is significantly overblown in this movie but like all Directors, Ron Howard had to have some kind of plot...  It's exceptionally well filmed, it's brilliantly acted, particularly Lauda's role.  Hemsworth is truly brilliant.  So another racing movie notches us a bit closer to experience what it's really like to care only about driving better and faster than anyone else.

It is a look at a rivalry that existed between two Formula 1 champions from the 1970's and the outward dislike and inward respect that they had for each other.  If you are fan of racing, this is a unique look behind the scenes of international auto racing in a most tumultuous era of auto racing.  It also includes some rather clever scenes of the off track escapades of our two heroes.

I found the movie well paced if not rushed at times.  Ron Howard must be a pyromaniac as the fire scene is reminiscent of his movie Backdraft.  The story is one of enemies on the battlefield with a complicated friendship off.  The story may not be for all, for example, I am sure my wife would not like this movie near as much as I did since the movie does not delve too deeply into the complicated emotional states of the men.  It treats them more simply as most men are the not the complicated beings that women think we are.

Overall I recommend this movie to guys that like racing, especially if you can remember racing in the 1970's.",1395878400,3,1091,4.257281553398058

Rush
Release Date: September 27, 2013
Notable Actors: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, and Olivia Wilde
Director: Ron Howard

This is a movie based on the true story about the fierce rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) in Formula One racing. Both racers are in a league of their own when racing against each other. Niki is strict about how he goes through life. He is a perfectionist. He believes in order for him to win races everything must be right. James on the other hand is going with the flow in life. He is a partier and likes enjoy simple pleasures. He also takes bigger chances in his racing ability that no one else would dare to take. Both showed struggles in beginning of their careers as Niki took out a loan and put himself in the highest level of competition, Formula One, from the beginning. While James raced mostly in Formula Three dominating everyone until he had an opportunity to race in Formula One. However, James is unable to race in Formula One his first season with the lack of sponsors so he only races a couple of tracks that season. He ends up going through a depression stage, and loses hope of racing again. However, he starts to gain some hope and it isn't until the next season he gets a sponsorship and now he must prove to the world that he has what it takes to beat Niki Lauda.

I really enjoyed the James Hunt and Niki Lauda rivalry they had going on. They both were to totally different people. One was a perfectionist that nobody really cares for but was a respected driver on the track. The other was a partier that every girl wanted to sleep with but was ridicule for his actions off the track. That is what made this rivalry unique in a way. It shows both drivers in great detail throughout the movie, so it would give you the anticipation by the end of the movie who would actually win the title of World Champion that season. This rivalry started when Niki Lauda actually lost to James Hunt in a Formula Three race in the beginning of the movie. At the time, James Hunt didn't realize that would be his main competition throughout the movie. Even though the two were totally opposite people they both recognized each other as worthy opponents and push each other to their individual limits

For a racing movie, I really like how they directed it. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a great racing movie with showing the struggles off the track.

5589721,4,B00BEIYP1W,"To enjoy Ron Howards latest film Rush, you don't have to know anything about car racing or motor sport in general. Penned by Peter Morgan, twice Oscar-nominated writer of The Queen and Frost/Nixon, the film is about James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl), two real-life race car drivers with opposite personalities and philosophies, locked in deadly rivalry in the early 1970s.

The storytelling is rather conventional, with two rivaling racers coming to understanding and respecting each other, but the story is engaging and well-told. Two female characters Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) and Marlene Lauda (Alexandra Maria Lara) do not have much to do in the story, and some audiences may think characters like F1 driver Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) should be given more screen time. After all, this is a film about James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the film sticks to that principle.

With the cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) conveying the atmosphere of the 1970s, Rush is an engaging 120-minute ride, but its excitement comes not just from the thrilling racing sequences but from the relationship between two rivals risking their lives.",1395187200,4,1188,5.28042328042328

5589728,5,B00BEIYP1W,"This was a movie I had been wanting to see for quite some time and I must say I am glad I finally did. My thoughts on the movie Rush.

Rush is based on the true stories of formula 1 race drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. In Rush, James is classified as being an arrogant, drug addicted playboy. Then we have Niki who not only has a heart for formula 1, but also has the skill set and drive.  But once these two meet each other, it begins an unforgettable rivalry.

Rush has a lot to love and a lot to offer as a movie. I should start by mentioning that this movie has some of the best cinematography I have seen in a movie (sorry Gravity) and the set pieces are very convincing.

Among the many great performances of the whole movie, Daniel Bruhl's performance (which got a lot of acclaim) is absolute fire. Like, I really can not understand why the certain movies/actors/actresses get nominated in favor of others that actually deserve it, but I should not start an unecessary rant on how I feel about the Motion Picture Academy. Nonetheless, His performance was nothing short of brilliant. Chris Hemsworth's performance was gratifying as well. Great job with the acting.

To close, Rush triumphs due to the fact that all acts are perfectly executed, the acting/chemistry on both ends is equally sharp, and its overall setup and direction is boldly sequenced. Rush is definitely a movie worthy of:

In other words, a very predictable movie. OK, I can deal with that, because it must have some really fast car scenes! Ho hum...WRONG AGAIN. I was expecting fast car, edge of your seat action. Never got delivered. I already saw similar race car action scenes in Stallones film DRIVEN years ago. These action scenes didn't bring anything new.

Many of the original cars from the 1976 Formula 1 season were borrowed and used for the filming of sequences, actors chosen for the roles looked very much like the original people, very well filmed.  Ranks right up there with LeMans as the best racing movie ever but with a better story.  I had worked as a pit official back in those days, including at the Formula 1 races at Watkins Glen.

Hunt the hard living and hard loving man and lauda the deliberate and business oriented man. If yu were around then, you know what happened, if not sit back and go for a terrific ride. ron Howard is such and amazing director....very few equals.

5590219,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I love this movie!  Im a fan of Steve McQueens Le Mans and the Grand Prix movie with James Garner but this movie takes racing portrayals to a whole new level.  Its the dramatization of a real life event, the competition between James Hunt of Great Britain and Niki Lauda of Austria during 1976 to claim the Formula 1 World Racing Chanmpionship.  Hunt is played by  Chris Hemsworth and and Lauda by Daniel Bruhl.

Normally I won't give a movie 5 out of 5 stars on the basis that few movies are good enough to rate five.  This movie, however, is such a powerful portrayal of human drive and spirit that I cant help but give it 5 stars.  Its not a technical movie but there are plenty of race sequences within the film.  Its more a depiction of the personal struggles (no doubt overly dramatized for impact) about the lives of two men trying to claim a near unattainable goal.  Both are portrayed as misfit outcasts, driven by their abilities, arrogance, and sheer will.  James Hunt is a flamboyant, undisciplined, carousing, drugging, skirt chasing, wise guy who actually claimed he had bedded over 5000 women and who was hung-over every time he got on the track.  He was basically disowned by his family because of his desire to race rather than go to law school or medical school.  Lauda on the other hand carries a stern Prussian demeanor, very smart, very disciplined, analytical, rational, and very straight-laced  dislikable at first glance.  His family was a powerful, old money Austrian banking family that disowned him over his racing desires and he was out to prove a point.  The contrast between the two personalities helps to strengthen the tale.

The movie starts but quickley flashes back to build a complete background from which the story continues to unfold forward.  The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is established and developed to a bitter level between two men racing Formula 1 cars around the tracks at speeds approaching 200 mph.  As the tension between the two builds over the course of the 1976 season, Lauda loses control of his Ferrari at Germanys Grand Prix at Nurburgring in August of that year and crashes.  He is hospitalized and hovers near death for several days before emerging with terrible facial burns and lung injuries from his entrapment in the blazing racer.  The film offers a very distinct portrayal of all this and his subsequent disfiguring scarring.  He suffers and struggles through recovery to reappear and compete at Italys Grand Prix just 6 weeks later at the astonishment of everyone.

Rush is really a great film.  The final scenes are, at least to me, a heartfelt example of two mis-fit misfits exchanging thoughts on the lives theyve lived, their own shortcomings, and their victories, fleeting as they may be.

This is now one of my favorite movies.",1393804800,,2802,4.777546777546777

The acting is superb all the way around, the racing scenes are so exciting even for a female like myself who has no knowledge of Formula One racing (until now) and the story is beyond amazing......I'm rather surprised that there weren't Academy Award nominations for this movie; it was truly one of Ron Howard's very best and he's had some major winners as we all know.....This movie is one that will stand the test of time and simply couldn't be better or more exciting or more perfectly crafted.....I absolutely LOVE this film!!!!!!",1393804800,,835,4.76551724137931

5590267,5,B00BEIYP1W,"If you asked me about formula one racing before seeing this movie, I could tell you that's it's racing cars and that it's popular in other countries and definitely not in the United States. I had never heard of James Hunt or Nikki Lauda in my life, and that probably contributed to my enjoyment of the film. This is an incredibly well-made movie about the rivalry between these two men.

One of the reason why Rush is so great is that neither Hunt nor Lauda was really the antagonist. Hunt is more focused on partying and living the celebrity life, taking a lot of risks during the racing and hoping for the best. Lauda is more reserved and serious, calculating every move he makes. Both are likeable at times and complete douchebags at others, but by the end I liked them both and it was cool to see that they learned something from each other. These two actors both did a great job in their roles, as did all of the supporting cast.

The story is punctuated by thrilling and harrowing racing scenes. Apparently, there is a 20% chance that any of these Formula One racers could die, and that makes many moments quite scary. The director also uses montages to keep the story moving briskly, and I was never remotely bored throughout, despite expecting Rush to feel draggy.

I haven't heard much about this movie, but it deserves much more attention than it gets. It's extremely well-made and one of the best movies of 2013. Even if you are not at all into Formula One like I am, I still implore you to check it out.",1393718400,,1515,4.462093862815885

5590272,3,B00BEIYP1W,"1976. Two racing drivers are competing for the Formula One World Championship. Racing for Ferrari is Niki Lauda, a studious, restrained, methodical and logical driver. Racing for McLaren is James Hunt, a flamboyant British playboy who prefers partying to doing homework about downforce and aerodynamics. Their radically different styles of driving are put to the test in a season-long showdown that will leave one of them physically scarred for life.

Rush is the movie dramatisation of the events of the 1976 Formula One championship season. This season is infamous for its nailbiting, year-long battle between Hunt and Lauda. The showdown is often cited as being the transformative moment for F1's popular appeal, turning it from a niche sport into a global phenomenon as a result of the sale of TV rights for the whole season, allowing motor sports fans across the world to see every race rather than odd highlights.

It's also noted for another shocking event: at one of the races Lauda's Ferrari spun out and burst into flames. It took a minute for Lauda to be pulled from the car, during which he suffered burns to his entire body. He was rushed to hospital and was not expected to survive, even being given the Last Rites by a priest. Unbelievably, Lauda survived and recovered. Even more unbelievably, he was back in the racing seat just six weeks after the accident, determined to take the championship to the last race, which he did.

If director Ron Howard had made up this story, people would be howling to the rafters about its contrived nature. However, the fact that it is true adds an air of authenticity to the drama which really helps sell the tension.

As well as its story and tension, Rush also does very well with its actors. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl play Hunt and Lauda to perfection, with Bruhl in particular going to some lengths to nail Lauda's very precise and distinctive way of speaking, familiar to hundreds of millions of people around the world from almost forty years of working in F1 (as a driver and more recently as a team executive for Mercedes). Other actors tend to fade a little in less-prominent appearances, but Alexandra Maria Lara brings dignity to the role of Lauda's wife, Marlene, and Natalie Dormer has a small but memorable role as a nurse treating Hunt for a crash injury early on in the movie.

Where the film falters is its treatment of the races. Millions of people watch F1 every year all around the world and faking the races with CGI was never going to work (you can tell straight away). Indeed, the few scenes where CGI is clearly used are distracting. At the same time, Howard was never going to get a budget large enough to accurately rebuild 20+ 1976 F1 racing cars and race them at the real circuits, where they have survived (in fact, the $38 million budget is rather small for such a film). The result is a compromise: several real cars are built and raced around, enhanced with CG where necessary, with the distracting use of full-CGI scenes and backgrounds kept to a minimum. This all works reasonably well, but it means that the actual racing is kept to a minimum, with the focus on the drama.

This is where the film comes unstuck. Howard establishes early on that Hunt is the playboy who lives on the seat of his pants and loves partying and women, whilst Lauda is the serious technician who knows the engineering of F1 cars better than several of his dedicated engineers. And that's really it, neither of them change or evolve through the film. Hunts gets married because he thinks it's good for his image and this doesn't work out, which we could guess. Lauda is arrogant and opinionated and is sometimes proven wrong, teaching him occasional moments of humility which never seem to last. A frequent problem of adapting real events into stories is that real life is too disorganised and people too varied to fit into the boxes required by drama, and in this case there isn't enough meat to the story arcs to justify the amount of time that is spent on the non-racing segments.

As a result, Rush (***) feels a little bit lightweight. The racing scenes, where they actually exist, are good. The battle on track and the off-track battle of wills between the two drivers is well-handled, driven by excellent performances. But there isn't enough actual character development to justify the amount of time spent on the non-racing segments, and there isn't enough money or practical ability to focus on the racing segments more successfully than they do here. It all ends up being fun, but with a sense of also being underwhelming compared to some of the actual documentaries covering the events.",1393632000,2,4668,4.7555555555555555

Ron Howard has done an amazing job of casting characters.  Not only do the main characters look, sound and act like the real men but so do the supporting actors.  Even set scene matched still photographs and film of the time.  In most cases the real race cars were used except for the crash scenes.  I know some of the car owners who confirmed it.
Racing movies are usually not very good and there are only two that most people recognize as the gold standard in this genre LeMans and Grand Prix.  Both have great racing scenes including real life footage but the stories fall flat.  Rush does both so it sets the new standard.
The 1976 season had even more drama and controversy that could have been put in this film but Ron Howard kept the most important ones to keep it going.

In fact, it may make it a better experience not having any preconceived notions about the films subjects, Niki Lauda & James Hunt. Apparently their rivalry was exaggerated to create more of a struggle between racing icons and to make the story more personal between the two of them. I don't mind that one bit as that what films are meant to do. They exaggerate real life so that they can actually fit onto the Big Screen.

I thought this was a really good movie. Most importantly it is an entertaining one. It is action packed, well-acted and beautifully shot. I loved the visual style and grainy feel of the film. I thought the Howard/Grazer team did an excellent job and seem to have rebounded from their last two duds.

Chris Hemsworth may be the marquee name, but Daniel Brhl is really the star of the film. I felt that both actors did an excellent job as I never once felt that Hemsworth was simply eye candy or Thor in an F-1 machine. Brhls portrayal of Lauda had me both wanting to slap him silly one moment and laughing at his social ineptness the next. Its his moody arrogance and social ineptness that shows how different these two men are.

Rush is a good description - the whole enterprise felt like it was racing to the finish line but interrupted by whiplash-like stops and starts. Whatever flow there was was constantly interrupted by cuts that were abrupt and jarring, and which left the storyline in the dust.  Sometimes the dialogue attempted to fill in the gaps but then it just became exposition.  My main criticism however was that I never once felt empathy for either of these characters; they both came across as selfish, childish, manipulative and driven  but not in a good way.  Maybe racing drivers are a breed unto themselves but in their addiction to speed and winning they left devastation in their wake.

It was really interesting to have his added commentary and I think we were both pleasantly surprised at how accurate the movie was. It's certainly not a perfectly factually correct telling (but it's a movie, I certainly would not expect it to be exact).
Chris Hemsworth did a wonderful job but I think Daniel Brhl stole the show. He was absolutely fantastic at playing Niki.
Overall I highly recommend this movie. My only warnings would be that if you don't handle some gore very well, you may want to watch it with someone who can tell you when to close your eyes.",1392681600,,660,4.462809917355372

I see where people say Thor as a race car driver and pick on Chris Hemsworth and that the acting was dismal --laughable even-yet he was nominated for this role-did not win-but I join the ones who can see past his role as Thor and see the meat and texture he gave the role of James Hunter.,1392681600,,443,3.879120879120879

5590715,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I don't know how this exquisite movie was ignored by the typical year-end awards. Perhaps the subject matter of Formula 1 racing was a turn-off for some, but even to non-aficionados (like myself,) the movie is too well-made and the subject too compelling to deny that this is a superb film in all measures of filmmaking.

What distinguishes this story from countless other sports movies is its pair of protagonists who are also the other's nemesis. It seems like almost every other film in the genre relies on the clichd format of having a clear hero defeat an enemy in a big showdown, if not on the scoreboard then at least on a moral level. However, ""Rush"" provides a fresh take on competition by having two fascinating heroes to cheer for and against, since both men equally divide the viewer's affection. The film's poster may highlight just a giant mugshot of Thor, but this film is definitely about two men and their complex relationship over the years. Both leads are perfect foils for one another, as one is a cheerful charmer while the other is a brooding intellectual. The movie skillfully balances either at times to be the hero or villain, though both men share the same consuming passion for victory, yet are also victims of enormous ego. While Chris Hemsworth is quite fantastic, costar Daniel Brhl gives a truly sublime and star-making performance that surely heralds many lead roles to come.

The film is gorgeous too, from the European environments to the weather and tracks. Everything is lushly captured to give personality to every setting and race. The '70s time period is also nicely recreated in all elements of attire, music and style.

""Rush"" is a spectacular accomplishment in cinema for evolving the sports genre in a thoughtful, powerful and mature way. But anyone without any knowledge of racing at all can still enjoy this beautiful and intense film.",1392595200,3,1880,4.86875

For one, it means creating a legacy, while disregarding its impact on those around him, while the other was to win once and reach the pinnacle was enough; but to him it was to live hard and die young.  the movie does a good job of not being judgement on which way might be best, rather there is a price to pay either way to be the best.",1392595200,2,415,4.32051282051282

This movie would only appeal to young, virile twenty year old men whose brains are in their genitals or old guys with brains in their genitals. Just a, shall I say it, car wreck of a movie! The dialogue is so predictable and the 'rivalry' between these two is so superficial and just badly done. Don't waste your money unless you are from one of those categories mentioned above. I never write reviews but I felt so 'taken' by all these ridiculous 5 star ratings that I gotta speak up. Save your money and watch ""Senna"" instead if you want to see a great film about racing and human drama. You don't have to be a race enthusiast to enjoy that. Chris Hemsworth is a joke - a pouty, model. The other guy turned in a credible performance but was imprisoned in a bad script. I would have much rather seen a documentary about these guys.

That would have made it more interesting for those who have been to or raced at the various venues. The true racing triad is drivers, cars and tracks. A very minor thing considering how few people might have liked to admire these famous cars and tracks for a few more seconds, while they enjoy an excellent movie. But a documentary would have been boring to most people and Ron Howard was smart to avoid veering off into the ""docu-drama"" weeds. Keeping the focus on the rivalry and the intensity of Hunt and Lauda makes it a movie with a contemporary feel that anybody can understand and enjoy, racer or not.

5591003,4,B00BEIYP1W,"`Everyone's driven by something' is the perfect tag line for this intense film by director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan that successfully revisits the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s. The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.

The film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Brhl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda. This is an action film with doubt, but it is also a psychological dramatization of a true story that for once works very well on film. Grady Harp, February 14",1391904000,3,1452,4.902439024390244

5591005,5,B00BEIYP1W,"James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl) were fiercely competitive Formula 1 racers (as was Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna) - to win at all costs but in the final analysis, this movie evolves into a deeper meaning of life and what ""winning"" is really all about. The experience, the tenacity, the dedication, the courage and most significantly, the sacrifices one is willing to make to win. ""Rush"" is well directed and well produced - the cinematography was dynamic, dramatic and, well, a Rush of adrenaline.

I was lucky enough to have watched these racers (Hunt and Lauda) compete in many circuits but never did I have any real insight into the men behind the wheels. Hunt, flamboyant and basically without morals - Lauda, analytical and calculating. Two very different personalities but inextricably linked by a fiercely competitive bond. I will let other reviewers describe the actions, the sounds, the high intensity of motor sport racing in this movie - I wish to go deeper into the souls of these two men and point out the deeper meaning of life. I do hope that viewers will come away from this movie with a deeper sense of appreciation, more than merely the thrills and excitement of racing.

5591091,4,B00BEIYP1W,Ron Howard's wonderful directing skills are once again on display in this story about two bitter race car rivals who learn that great competition can push you to be a world champion.,1391904000,2,182,4.71875
5591092,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Yes, there are plenty of things you could nit-pick at. Some of the dialogue falls flat. Some of the acting, especially by the supporting cast, is a bit too insistent. Every dramatic turn is a bit too obviously foreshadowed. I especially wish there was a feature on the Blu-ray that allowed you to mute the race commentary. It's abysmal. It seems it's only there to help the hopelessly clueless follow along.

Still, it somehow really, really works. I don't know if it's the best movie of 2013, but for me, it's certainly the most entertaining.

There are subtle layers to this flick. First, to fully appreciate it, it helps to know that this based-on-a-true-story movie is much more based on a true story than most based-on-a-true-story movies. In other words, what would usually be formulaic, groan inducing contrivances in a Hollywood sports movie aren't so groan inducing, because what you see is pretty much what actually happened. The 1976 Formula 1 season really was this unbelievable. Google it! (But only after you've seen the movie).

What I particularly enjoyed is that the movie is a spot-on study of the competitive male ego. Sure, many women also share this trait, but this movie is very much concerned with ""dudes"" who are obsessively driven. The point here is not to moralize it, but to marvel at it. Myself, being an obsessively driven and competitive dude--as are my closest friends--I kept trying to figure out which character more represented my persona, as I could see parts of myself in both of them. And that's the point. Hunt and Lauda, as presented in Rush, are an extrapolation of the competitive male ego in that guys like us are constantly embroiled in this tension between the opportunity for self-glorification and the assessment of risk. Unlike the movie, though, it's not really the risk of our physical lives in the sense that our chosen professions might actually kill us, but the risk of our existential lives. What I mean is that it's the risk of how much of our lives we're willing to give up in order to reach our professional goals and the adulation that will come of it. Are we willing to give up closeness with our wives and children? Opportunities to enjoy other aspects of life? Our friends? What is professional success really worth to us? That's the question this movie explores.

I've read a bunch of professional reviews that criticize the final scene as unnecessary. I totally disagree. That scene is intrinsic to the movie as it lays out its central theme.

Aside from the minor criticisms mentioned above, the acting by the two mains is first-rate, the cinematography is absorbing, the music scoring drives the plot, and the directing and editing are excellent, save for a segment at the end of a press conference scene that is somewhat diminishing of the characterization of Hunt and the film as a whole.

Sorry this movie bombed at the box office. When I recommend it to my friends, they usually sneer and say, ""Oh, is that that race car movie? Looks lame."" But I keep prodding them, and when they do see it, they've loved it. I have a feeling this move will catch on.",1391817600,2,3119,4.7560073937153415

5591195,5,B00BEIYP1W,"As an F1 fan I found this film to be very entertaining. Rush accurately conveys the compelling drama of the traveling circus that is F1. The film compares favorably with not just other racing films but also other great sports films like Hoosiers. Watching past racing movies I found the racing sequences to be quite gripping while the off the track drama and dialog never shined, boring. Movies like Bobby Deerfield (Pacino) boring, Grand Prix (James Garner)and Le Mans (McQueen) boring, boring.

The script in Rush is high quality supercharged. The script follows real life drivers Niki Lauda & James Hunt in the years leading up to and competing for the 1976 World Championship. It is no secret that Hunt and Lauda had opposing personalities and prepared for competition in starkly different ways. This contrast is shown to great effect in the relationships they have with friends & confidants, women, team owners and journalists. By the time they make it to the closing races of the 1976 season the drama and excitement have you hooked.

Formula One, like other sports(think Magic vs Bird in the 80s) has had great years with high drama- recall the 2008 F1 season when the world championship was decided on the last lap of the last race. But F1 has also had the not so great(think late 1990s, early 00s when Schumaker had the championship wrapped up by mid season....yawn). But 1976 was a great year and director Howard was right to focus his cameras on that year as two outstanding drivers with interesting personalities fought it out(watch for a cameo by the six wheeled Tyrell). Most Americans do not follow F1 (their loss). The outstanding script and compelling action on the track (turn up the home theatre speakers)make this a film that F1 enthusiasts and casual fans alike will find entertaining.",1391644800,,1806,4.879478827361564

Overall I would give it a 4/5 because it was a subject I was eager to see, but in general, if this were not a subject I were interested in I feel like I would maybe have given the movie a 3/5.

They did a good job with the actor that played Lauda.  I liked this era of racing because the drivers still had to change their own gears and there were no electronic traction or stability control in the cars yet. I remember watching Niki Lauda as a little kid and cheering him on when he came back to racing, so it was a very pleasant surprise to realize that this movie is about him (and Hunt).",1391644800,2,779,3.9426751592356686

The movie is not just about racing around a track, there is actually very little in comparison to other automotive inspired movies, the story that is the movie is what makes this movie so grand!

It is a story about 2 men, their differences and similarities and how they seemed to hate and despise on another when in truth they respected and cared for each other!

The successes are stimulating to the point of propelling you towards the next race and goal allowing you to feel that force and desire of ambition.  And the sacrifices are evident through the painful persistence of Lauda who is determined to get back on the track.  The smart, edgy dialogue between Lauda and Hunt is comic yet insightful.

5591481,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I have to say, I was pleasantly shocked by this movie, especially seeing Hemsworth in THOR, and vowing to never watch one of his movies again (What a stinkburger that movie was, PU).
THIS movie, however, is just truly remarkable.  It's not overstated, it's not full of ""wow you"" effects, it's just really good story and the character development is fantastic.  Don't get me wrong, the driving sequences are excellent and the capturing of the cars, stress and grit that makes these guys who they are is really very good.
As far as I'm concerned, Daniel Brhl's performance as Niki Lauda was just outstanding, he should get an Oscar for that performance.  He was so believable as an arrogant, egotistical, cocky Austrian, he really made the part, and imho really upstaged Hemsworth in this movie. Honestly, any bold partying British actor could have done Hemsworth's part, but at the end you see the real people this story is portrayed after and the actors really were spot on for the parts.

5591484,4,B00BEIYP1W,"It was ""very well made"".....take that as you will.
These two guys were much closer, and much more amicable than the movie implies...even sharing an apartment during their life..
The race scenes were very slick, and again, very well done, but real racing (the actual driving/racing) is much dirtier...more uncomfortable...grittier I guess is the word I am looking for.
Niki's fire was pretty realistic...no complaints there...but that is thanks to modern, digital photographic abilities of today's movies. Again...racing is not like that...think of the race scenes in Le Mans or Grand Prix.
The acting was superb  on all counts. Niki and James were very well played...as were the supporting roles.
Lord Hesketh and his entourage were a pretty good cast as well. Though Ron Howard kind of glossed over the fact that Hesketh was a fat, rich,political A-Hole that worshiped at the feet of Margaret Thatcher. His (many) business endeavors failed, and he did sell his family estate, but he was hardly a ruined man were finances are concerned...he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth...those types rarely get what they truly deserve.
Enzo Ferarri was a big A-Hole...and the movie got it right...they should get on their knees and Thank God for Niki Lauda. He really opened their eyes to modern Formula One racing, and more importantly, BUILDING. Untill that time, Enzo was stuck in the past...race cars were built for power and speed...Damn the weight, safety, handling, stopping, etc etc etc. Niki Lauda was the force that was big enough to open the Ears and shut the Mouth of Enzo  Ferarri.
What can you say...a story like this can never be told in a 2 hour movie. It seemed like it was half that long, so it must have been a good film. If it was 2 days long, it would only have been able to tell 2% of the whole story.
Niki and James were almost made for each other. It harks back to a much better time in Formula One...when horse power was more reasonable, and the drivers actually had to ""heal and toe""  (toe and toe is more like it)...they had to shift and double clutch A LOT in those days...that is a BIG SKILL that no longer exists...a lot of racing disappeared when those stupid paddle shifters came on board.
Anyway...watch the movie, it is quite good. Buy their books if you want to know the real story of these two guys. I spent a dollar and a half at Red Box to see this...not sure I would pay 20 bux...but that is all relative to how much money you have to spend. There are Much Worse movies out there.

5591486,5,B00BEIYP1W,"For racing fans, there are only 3 movies that capture the essence of racing1966's Grand Prix (James Garner), 1969's Winning (Paul Newman) and 1971's LeMans (Steve McQueen). There have been a few noble attempts, but most were excuses for Hollywood chase scenes and crashes. When I heard Ron Howard was filming Rush, I cringedhe'd be the last guy Id pick to film anything about racing. What could Opie/Richie bring to a sport so alien to him? (Howard's own admission) I was so wrong. Howard finally added a 4th movie to that list of all-time racing greats.

I grew up watching F1 in the 70'sI have a collection of photos and memorabilia from the '76-'77 season, so I know the subject pretty thoroughly. Howard NAILED itthe look, the attitudes, the F1 glamor, tracks and technology of the era and captured it PERFECTLY. I was very impressed by his portrayal of the excessive danger of the time (totally unacceptable and barbaric by today's standards). Howard shows the violence, but doesn't glamorize it the way Hollywood is prone to. He shows it for what it isan ugly, disgusting, stomach-turning reality of racing back then. That caught me by surprise since that isn't typical of Ron Howard's movies.

But mostly Rush is about the storya narrative of two drivers whose rivalry is so intense they will do anything to beat each other, including risking both their lives (well beyond the limits of the day) and suffer extreme physical pain to just to win. Beyond that, Ill let you check it out for yourself. Keep in mind, this isn't about the post-NASCAR, ultra-sanitized, super-safe world of racing today, so don't expect a crash-fest where everything turns out nice when the checkered flag fallsit's realistic and gritty, and gets ugly at a couple of points in the film.

Their intense loathing is played out on the race track and they battle back and forth throughout the movie.

The story itself is based upon a false premise; that Hunt & Lauda were enemies and bitter rivals. Rivals, to be sure, but they actually shared an apartment early in their careers, and were certainly not the vocal antagonists portrayed in the movie.
Many liberties were taken with the true story, but such is Hollywood. I hoped that there might be some good racing footage, but that is lacking. The racing  photography in 1966's 'Grand Prix"" was MUCH better than in ""Rush"".
This movie provides little real insight on mid 1970's Formula One racing, but I should have expected that; has to appeal to a broad audience, I suppose, but ends up with a hodgepodge of mediocre vignettes.

5591639,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Rush runs contrary to the formulaic trends in filmmaking, producing a unique movie that is both interesting and memorable.  The central story (no spoilers) is about a rivalry between the two central characters, James Hunt and Niki Lauda - both of whom are trying to break into the big leagues of Formula One racing.  Hunt, played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), is a charismatic, hard partying playboy whose recklessness in life translates into brilliance as a racer.  Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, is something of a mirror image.  He's an abrasive, mechanical genius who views the sport purely as a monetary exercise.  The personal aversion between the two is instantaneous and a huge rivalry ensues as both clamor for recognition as the best in the world.

As a film, Rush succeeds on multiple levels, combining very solid cinematography together with a storyline thats both interesting and engaging.  There is a bit of a back and forth throughout the movie as you alternate between the personal lives of Lauda and Hunt and the races.  And while some of it is predictable, there are several points along the way where you're dealt some major surprises (unless you know the historical backstory).  And the story grows too, progressing from something that is initially entertaining to something that's emotionally gripping.

The cinematography is outstanding.  As there are numerous races, some of the chronicling is done as a montage, which is understandable given the number of years they must cover.  However, some key races are handed in depth and the experience is both highly immersive and visually engaging.  Some of the weather sequences are particularly worth mentioning.

Rush is memorable.  Days later, the story line remain clear, the characters focused and the images burned into my retina.  There are parts of the film that some may find distasteful (hence the R rating).  However, the larger story is one worth watching and Id definitely endorse it.  Maybe not everyones cup of tea, but for me it was the best movie of 2014.",1391299200,2,2035,5.023880597014926

The pounding soundtrack, which is supposed to supply some excitement I guess, is more deafening to the brain than a V-12 at full song. And the images, like disjointed flash cards, fly across the screen in a frenetic attempt to gin up some sense of what F1 is. Most excruciating is the film's inevitable descent into sentimentalism. With Howard at the helm, how could it not?

 Daniel Br&uuml;hl is outstanding as three-time Formula One champ Niki Lauda and even looks like the real guy and plays him well as the serious friendless driver.

Chris Hemsworth  also has a passing resemblance to James Hunt, and does a great job as well at playing the party boy and popular driver and Lauda's competition on the track.

Both actors chemistry plays well against each other and the rivalry was well played and realistic.

Daniel Bruhl does an amazing job portraying Niki Lauda and Chris Hemsworth is a spitting image of James Hunt. Unlike most Hollywood stories, this one needed no dramatic enhancement... in fact, according to Ron Howard, they needed to tame it down! Lauda himself has endorsed this film, saying it's pretty much as it happened.
The action sequences were very well shot. The period correct cars are just mouth watering to watch.

5591955,3,B00BEIYP1W,"I expected a lot of this film, being a racing and Formula 1 enthusiast yet also being fully mindful that no successful film about machinery has ever been made.  The much-derided ""Days of Thunder"" actually comes as close to being a good racing film as any, because it focuses strongly on the characters, cartoony as they are, rather than the cars.  And on the other hand, the adored Steve McQueen film ""Le Mans"" remains a travesty, scriptless and virtually bereft of dialogue--a film about racecars that happen to be driven by people.  So ""Rush"" at least partially succeeds on that basis, being a film about two people--James Hunt and Niki Lauda--rather than their racecars.

But if you you are going to use two real characters as the core of the film, why warp reality so badly by making them mortal enemies when in fact the real Hunt and Lauda were warm friends?  They in fact shared an apartment in London during the early stages of their racing career and remained close thereafter.

5591958,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I was mesmerized by this film. The true story it's based on is astonishing. The movie is powered by the great performances by Helmsworth and Bruhl, portraying in very nuanced fashion the true love-hate relationship they had. The movie evokes the danger of the sport in the great racing sequences, but especially in the lead up to one race where it's raining and foggy but postponement is not an option since the TV rights have been sold worldwide. The drivers know full well they could die...that scene is spine-tingling with a palpable sense of dread, and the whole movie has a tense undercurrent because of the danger of what they are doing. The 70's was an era where seemingly the safety technology had not been keeping pace with engine technology, making it an ever more dangerous undertaking.

I almost gave this film a miss as I felt the cheese factor could be high with Ron Howard directing. But it got some amazing reviews. I was very pleasantly surprised that indeed, this is a great film and probably the best thing Ron Howard's ever done (though I do remember Apollo 13 was really good too.)

5591959,4,B00BEIYP1W,"I remember the marketing campaign for Rush, which claimed it was unmissable and full of thrills. While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it's definitely not as advertised.

It's actually better, but in a different way.

The movie performed badly at the US box office, making just $27 million. Formula One racing isn't very popular in North America, so it's not hard to see why audiences weren't anxious to see the movie in theaters.

The story focuses on the 1976 Formula One championship, which came down to a battle between two men:

James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was an English playboy more interested in pursuing the lifestyle of a superstar than devoting his life to his career. We see him drinking, smoking, and chasing beautiful women. He's carefree, controversial and irresponsible. In contrast, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl) will do anything to succeed. He takes care of his health, goes to bed early, and seemingly has more knowledge of how to get the best out of his car than his mechanics and the team owners.

An early scene shows how Hunt and Lauda first raced together in the lower Formula Three class. Lauda is forced off the track by Hunt and takes an instant dislike to him. Over a period of six or seven years, the rivalry intensifies. Success in Formula One racing depends on the competitiveness of the car as much as the ability of the driver. Lauda negotiates a deal to drive for one of the best teams, Ferrari. Hunt resorts to begging for a position with any team that will give him a car good enough to compete. He eventually signs with Hesketh.

You might think that a movie about car racing would be full of action, but director Ron Howard spends more time off the track than on it. He develops the plot by showing us the contrast between Hunt and Lauda. As well as character differences, they came from very different backgrounds. Hunt's family was rich and prepared to buy him a place on a team, but Lauda was disowned by his father after choosing racing over a more traditional career. We see Lauda succeeding on his own merit rather than being handed anything. While Hunt pursues any attractive woman who will spend the night with him, Lauda chooses a supportive woman who ended up being married to him until 1991.

Formula One racing is a glamorous sport. In 2013, two drivers earned $27 million in salary alone. Sponsorship deals would vastly increase that sum. If you have ever watched a race, you'll have seen the celebrities in attendance, as well as a horde of beautiful women. The movie speculates that women like racing drivers because they are so close to death, and that makes them more alive than other men. It also helps that they are incredibly rich. An early voice-over informs us that of the 25 drivers in Formula One, two will probably die by the end of the season. Although that was true at the time, safety has improved enormously since the 1970s.

Will the movie work for you if you know nothing about Formula One? I grew up following the sport and still watch every race today. I have no interest in any other type of car racing. It's hard for me to imagine watching the movie without the knowledge I have gained over a lifetime, but I would think that the story has plenty to offer those who know nothing about the sport. It should work if you enjoy character studies. As for the acting, many think that Brhl should have received an Oscar nomination, while I have never seen Hemsworth deliver a better performance. The story is interesting and quite gripping. It felt as if only an hour had passed by the time that the credits rolled.

Writer Peter Morgan has given us some great stories set in the 1970s. He teamed up with Ron Howard for Frost/Nixon, which received international acclaim, while Tom Hooper's The Damned United does an excellent job of portraying English soccer.

If you are curious about seeing the film for the racing sequences, you might be disappointed. I would estimate that around 30 minutes is devoted to the actual races. Those sequences are done very well, and really give you an idea of what it might be like to drive a Formula One car. Howard also shows the dangers involved, and how a serious accident can occur in a split second. But there is a lot more to this movie than action sequences.

The Blu-ray delivers a spectacular presentation. Colors are vibrant, features are clear, and the audio is excellent when it needs to be. With ten deleted scenes and just over an hour of special features in total, the package offers plenty of insight into the making of the movie and Formula One in general.

5592012,3,B00BEIYP1W,"""Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving around in circles looking for normality."" During the 1970's Formula 1 racing was hugely popular. Two of the most popular drivers at that time were James Hunt (Hemsworth)and Niki Lauda (Brhl). They were instant rivals and personal enemies. During the 1976 season the rivalry hit its peak and the two found themselves neck and neck for the world championship. When Niki is involved in an horrific accident the two realize what they mean to each other. I was a little hesitant about watching this going in for a few reasons. I am not a racing fan nor am I a fan of racing movies. I wasn't a big fan of Days Of Thunder...so that is my disclaimer. As far as this movie goes it was better then I was expecting but I never really felt a connection with any of the people and when the accident happened it didn't really have any affect on me. Days Of Thunder did have more of a rivalry feel to it and played that up. This one focused more on each driver individually more then the racing rivalry. When you watch it you will know what I mean.

From the trailers I got the since that this movie would be nothing more than a silly little rival between to race car drivers, and all the playboy antics that go along with being popular with the ladies. Happily I was wrong. The rival/friendship between the two is what helped to drive each one to the sucess that they both turned out to be. Both Daniel Bruhl, and Chris Hemsworth did a fantastic job, and Ron Howard did a fantastic job casting two actors who looked so much like Niki Lauda, and James Hunt as he could get.

I had no expectations, I mean Ron Howard? Visconti he ain't. However, I enjoyed the film so much you can't imagine. Hardcore F1 fans can pick nits all they want, and certainly much is left out, but the actors are so beautifully matched and the period so well painted that the film is a delight. Hemsworth has charm without arrogance. Both Hunt and Lauda are portrayed brilliantly and neither Hunt (deceased) nor Lauda should be disappointed.

The only disclaimer I would make is the medical scenes with Lauda are pretty awful. Brace yourself.

My dream is that Rush will do well enough that someone will have the courage to make a film about Gilles Villeneuve, the best driver to never win a world championship whose life ended so tragically.

5592250,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Formula 1 is just such an amazing sport, and the story told about the 1970s rivalry, the accident, the emotions, the psychology of it all, it is absolutely mind-blowing.  Ron Howard never fails to disappoint.  Even if you're a NASCAR fan or some other type of racing, you'll appreciate this movie for a lot of reasons.  This is a thrilling, amazing piece of film, and really captures the essence of the ups and downs (and the bleeding edge) of 1970s Formula One Racing.  It's deep and emotional, yet technical and takes a true story and makes it outstanding to watch.  The film intimately explores the lives of the two drivers and the culture surrounding them.  The framing of the famous Nrburgring race, with the rain, the silhouette of a spider on the wall...  The commentary is fairly identical to that which I've heard watching F1 before, so Howard got it right there, though they focus slightly more on technical aspects of the cars at least these days.  It's also an amazing feat in that F1 is a global touring sport, so you get to see so many countries represented as settings; you go all around the world.  My only small beef is probably the long pit/tire change times; I know they were slower back then, but I don't think they were slow enough to have a full conversation.  Lauda's injury and subsequent hospitalization scenes are really painful to watch; you can almost feel his pain just seeing it, but I'm sure reality it was much worse an ordeal.  Regardless, the film has global appeal, and Howard really pushed filmmaking to new heights.

The actors/casting are particularly outstanding as well...  Seeing Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brhl in the lead roles, along with the rest of the cast, it really feels like they studied not only the script for the film, but all the history and footage surrounding it (and a bit of old footage is even spliced in, very well done).  This may be the performance of Hemsworth's life!  He and Bruhl are as professional as it gets as acting goes here.  Extremely well done in every aspect.  It's just mind-blowing that the sport that has become slightly safer today, was so all-or-nothing; they were literally sitting on rocketships with bombs under their seats.  The drama is interweaved with excellently shot, high-speed racing scenes.  This is the kind of film that will make you laugh, cry, and your heart beat out of your chest.  Bravo!

In the US, as of this writing, it's still in theaters, but on the PS3/PS4 (PSN) at least, you can get it before it comes to dvd/br/digital download (I think it may be a Sony exclusive).

One other note, not really exclusive to this film, but, there has been a real lack of R-rated movies as of late.  I don't know if this has to do with economics and the studios' fears of taking the risk on R-ratings, but some of the greatest films (thinking back to the 80s especially) have been R-rated films; studios often have to cut down R-rated films just to aim for a PG-13 rating, and we don't get to see what the filmmaker intended.  Here, I think you get to see everything Howard wanted.  This is a good thing.  I think the R-rated trend is re-emerging (Lone Survivor, etc), and I hope it will continue to do so.  Producers should lean into their fear and take the risks on these kinds of films, the same way Lauda leaned into his fear and took on racing even after suffering a loss.",1389744000,2,3368,4.579298831385643

But director Ron Howard has managed to keep Rush exciting enough to merit its title. This character-driven tale of two men fighting for the 1976 Formula One championship is compelling. Actor Chris Hemsworth brings the sexy and charming racer James Hunt superbly to life - and Daniel Bruhl does equally well in evoking the darker persona of Nikk Lauda.

The result? A tense and suspenseful rivalry between guys with extremely different personalities. The turbulent (to put it mildly) relationship between the men was the prime reason I enjoyed this film so much. The shots of the race cars in action, dramatic as they were, simply wouldn't have done the trick for me.

But the racing shots are still very impressive, with views from inside drivers' helmets and just about every angle imaginable. And of course there is the roar of the cars and the screams of the fans to ramp up the excitement factor.

5592339,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I've been following F1 since the 1960's so I was well aware of the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, but it was difficult for a fan back then to know the details and back story. This film fills in those missing pieces in a very, um, I was going to say enjoyable way, but at times the film is difficult to watch because it is kind of graphic, appropriate to the subject. I suspect that the movie is pretty accurate, you usually have no way of knowing how much is dramatic license by the filmmakers. The fact that Niki Lauda (who is portrayed in a somewhat less than flattering light in the movie) has fully endorsed the movie, even to the extent of appearing in some of the final minutes, gives the film great credibility.

At the time of the events portrayed in the film all the racing world was in awe of Lauda for his dramatic comeback from horrible injuries, but even for one who followed it so closely I was unaware of just how heroic his efforts to return were. He was my hero then and has remained so to this day.

I guess this should be a movie review, not just a synopsis of the events of the time, so I'll get to it.

It's a Ron Howard movie. He knows how to make a film. Wonderful casting (down to the point that when they show clips of the real Hunt and Lauda they are almost indistinguishable from the actors). The pace and excitement level are terrific, the drama is such that I felt fully gripped by the film every moment. And make no mistake, some people may think the subject matter of racing is somehow a frivolous endeavor, I assure you at the highest levels it is dramatic even without the triumph of human courage exhibited by Lauda.

The movie is shot in a different way than most movies today. The colors and focus are somewhat subdued, the general lighting on the dark side. I think this was a really smart choice by Howard so he could include period footage of the races seamlessly into the production. This surely doesn't have the look of Avatar! Nor should it.

The only criticism I can offer of the film really doesn't matter overall. The new footage of the actual race cars on track was shot using the people who own those cars now as the drivers. I doubt most people would notice, but I used to race and I can tell. They are driving about 70% and the ""incidents"" that are new footage are obviously staged. Nice usage of actual footage from the period makes it a moot point.

I've recommended this film to many non race car fan friends and they all reported that they loved it.

In the end, this is an intensely dramatic film that deserved better box office in the US.

This semi documentary about the Formula 1 racing season 1976 made me change my habit of staying away from sports movies. (One could argue that car racing is not a sport, but I wouldn't agree with that.)
Formula 1 is by no means always interesting. Rather, quite often it is as exciting as drying paint. Or growing grass.
1976 was a special year. English driver James Hunt on McLaren and Austrian defending champion Niki Lauda on Ferrari battled it out until the last moment of the year. Lauda had crashed his car half way through the season. The accident nearly killed him and disfigured him for life. Nevertheless he came back before the end of the season, hoping to defend his title.
The fight between the two men is unbeatable for drama due to an intense personal rivalry between the two aces. They were opposite types: the easy going popular playboy, versus the unpopular, abrasive, obsessed nerd.

What is common among these two men is they both think the other one is better than him. Just one shows it though.  The action is alive in a very futuristic Instagrammish fashion. However, at times, I did the feel the film was trying too hard and was even a bit cheesy but the good news is you end up liking both the protagonists too much to really care. Ever since Senna, I have found myself vaguely interested in F1 racing. This film shows two outlandish drivers both with very different school of thoughts, both far from perfect temperament and both hungry for approval. The character build up was very nice, so were the introductory scenes, I loved a scene where two fans meet one of the two popular drivers and go bonkers.  As good as the action was, I felt it could have been a little less ""fake"" and a bit more ""reel"" real. Maybe 20% more effort into showing the driving tactics and the film would have been a lot better. It seems Ron Howard should have made this film a bit more ""Senna"" and a little less ""Wanted"" if you catch my drift. Overall, I liked it a lot and yes it definitely worth viewing again in the future. The music will cause many adrenaline rushes to flow through your body.

Rush succeeds, on a variety of levels, and for several reasons:

- Ron Howard is a sympathetic director, with long experience with docudramas: ""Apollo 13"",  ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Frost/Nixon"" attest to this director's remarkable ability to tell a true story in an engaging, sympathetic yet accurate manner.

- For most Americans, Formula 1 car racing is unknown- a real challenge for the people involved in making the movie. Yet, they have drawn out the engaging true story, in a manner which transcends the car racing story background.

- For many people, the story is past history - it's about another era. The period has been recreated faithfully and sympathetically.

- The real life drama has been presented accurately and without embellishment. This is a testiment to the skill of the writer and director. And, while being historically accurate, the movie builds genuine tension and drama.

- This is not just a car race story- it's about the triumph of two men against adversity, and in that respect, it is genuinely inspirational.

- The storyline is multi-layered: there's the lives and distinctive personalities of the two protagonists, their rivalry, the racing, as well as the main characters' romances. These layers are masterfully blended, and related in an engaging fashion.

Before I saw this, I thought Rush would be a specialty interest movie. But, it's more: it is a genuine inspirational story- about real people.

5592469,5,B00BEIYP1W,"Rush, the newest film from director Ron Howard, who directed A Beautiful Mind and Frost/Nixon, certainly lives up to its name. The film follows two Formula One race car drivers in the 1970s--two men who hurtle around racetracks at 170 miles per hour in what one character calls ""coffins on wheels"".

James Hunt and Niki Lauda both leave their families' businesses behind in order to take a shot at the one thing they are good at--racing--but the similarities between the two end there. Hunt, played by Chris Hemsworth whom you may know as Thor in The Avengers, is a Brit with plenty of charm and a penchant for women and weed, and relies on guts and daring to win each race. Lauda, played by a Spanish-born German actor named Daniel Br&uuml;hl who will soon be seen in The Fifth Estate with Benedict Cumberbatch, is an abrasive perfectionist from Germany who relies on mechanical precision and intense preparation on his road to success. The two are rivals from their very first race on a Formula Three circuit in England, when both of their cars spin out of control and Hunt pulls a risky stunt to win the race. Their differing personalities and methods clash on and off the racetrack, and what follows is an intense rivalry as Hunt and Lauda ascend the ranks and make it to Formula One, and then face off against each other for the world championship title.

The 1970s were a very dangerous time for Formula One drivers, and there were many casualties. The threat of death looms large over both Hunt and Lauda, though they deal with it in very different ways. The swaggering, reckless Hunt throws up before most races, and the calculating Lauda declares that he will not go over a 20 percent risk of dying. The danger, and Hunt and Lauda's obsessive rivalry, comes to a head during the 1976 racing season, which changes the way they drive and view the world.

What I liked most about this film was the character development. The joint biopic of Hunt and Lauda does not shy away from the flaws found in both men. Hunt is a self-absorbed womanizer who races during the day and parties all night. Lauda is a cold, abrasive man who is not afraid to make enemies as he climbs to the top of his sport. Hunt, who almost oozes charm and literally has a girl out of her pants within five minutes of the movie, is the kind of guy that American audiences have been trained to root for--think James Kirk, James Bond, etc. But this film shows the dark side of the wise-cracking, charismatic hero. We see Hunt at his very lowest point, when he has lost his car and sponsor, gets drunk, and verbally abuses his wife. While Lauda has absolutely no charisma whatsoever, he assumes the heroic mantle in the second half of the film, as he provides a moral center.
Both men, at the end of the film, have learned from each other. Hunt learns about grit, determination, and loyalty, and Lauda understands the importance of passion both on and off the racetrack. As opposites they push each other to succeed and go to heights they never would have achieved on their own.

I loved this movie. It was compelling, gripping, and, well, a total rush. But what I loved most about the film, thrills aside, was the way it made me think about heroism. I left the theater thinking about what our culture values in heroes today, and about the things that make people truly heroic. We see Hunt and Lauda struggle, fail, and fall, and see all of their flaws on display. We see the low points of the character we would usually assume is the hero, and the quiet triumph off the track of the character we would usually love to hate. The acting, directing, and cinematography are top notch, but it is the characterization, and the questions that arise because of it, that make this film a true champion.",1381449600,15,3765,4.56508875739645

Naturally if we are hard-wired to seek to go from Point A to Point B faster, be it via goat-cart of sleek spaceship some guys, and lately some gals too,  want to be the fastest kid on the block, and get recognition for being Number One. The Ron Howard film under review, Rush, takes a modern day look at one such competitive flash in the world of top-shelf auto-racing.

Here Howard takes a look at the famous 1970s duel between Austrian Nikki Lauda and Englishman James Hunt (famous in auto-racing circles because I, frankly, was totally unaware of this competition). Both men in their respective ways were errant sons but both were desperate to be Number One in their chosen field, Formula One auto-racing. Number One at being the fastest kid on the block. Number One too in staring death in the face in a ""human bomb"" as one of them described it.

Now to be honest I get a little nervous, and not just cop nervous, going eighty miles an hour in a very serviceable tank (a tank compared to the high-tech machines they raced in). I also admit to having no interest at all in auto-racing at this level, although as a teenager I rode ""shot-gun"" a few times on ""chicken runs"" down at the far end of old Hullsville Beach (Massachusetts) when the king of the hill in that locale and my friend ""Stew-ball Stu"" Larkin took on all- comer and took all the girls back in the day, he 1960s day (that was why I was riding shot-gun, to get Stu's ""rejects"" not to stare death in the face, hell no). But that was maybe at ninety miles an hour, tops. However this film grabbed me and grabbed my companion too who gets nervous when she goes over sixty.

In the end the reason that it grabbed me (us) was the pure desire of both men to win at whatever cost, win to define who they were in this wicked old world, and to stare death in the face and not flinch, not flinch at all. To go the edge and back. They both had very different styles, Lauda the technician, the guy who has every angle figured out from design to the curves and Hunt, well, Hunt a throw-back playboy who just wanted a drive, wanted to drive something fast even if it is a go-cart, drive it desperately, drive it like there was no tomorrow. I would assume most audiences would cheer for Brother Hunt (especially women with his Brad Pitts good looks) but would not be unhappy to see Nikki cross the checkered flag first either for other reasons.

The rest of the story, about James Hunt, I didn't know, and this is a terrific movie, which brings alive the two characters, as well as the women in their lives.

The narrative for the most part focuses on the rivalry between drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauder (Daniel Bruhl), but it also examines both people in quite some detail.

The story also sheds much light on the not so easy path to F1 and the hazardous master it can be. The glitz of F1 is well presented by Hunt and Lauder is the disciplined strategist and innovator. However, in real life both men were playboys in their own ways.

It is a movie with plenty of thrills and the journey of Hunt and Lauder certainly gives the viewer much to think about.

Ron Howard's ""Rush"" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.

As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the ""bad boy,"" was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the ""good-boy,"" was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described ""rat face,"" barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.

The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or over-dramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.

Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about ""Rush"" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus.",1380931200,14,2427,4.985185185185185
5592475,5,B00BEIYP1W,"The rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda though of comparatively short duration, was nevertheless one of the greatest rivalries in sporting history.  The stakes were huge: life, death, the world championship.

Even though I did not follow Formula 1 racing then or ever, I clearly remember when this rivalry went global with badly burned reigning Formula One world champion Nikki Lauda being pulled out of a burning car at a grand prix, by his rival drivers. Almost dead from his injuries, it looked like his season if not his career was over.

I also clearly remember watching the charismatic James Hunt being interviewed about the subject.  Considerably behind Lauda on points in the world championship, his act of getting out of the car to help rescue Lauda could have potentially ruined his own ambitions to become world champion.  Truly, this is one of the most remarkable sporting rivalries of all time.

So, it was with more than a little anticipation that I looked forward to watching Ron Howard's take on these events done with the cooperation of Nikki Lauda.  James Hunt sadly died of a heart attack in 1993 at age 45.

If you are like me, you do not have to be a big racing fan to enjoy this.  Everyone understands we live in a world of rivalry and competition, and Ron Howard does an admirable job in this movie in crafting one of the most memorable movies of the year.

While I was one of the few people not very impressed with the movie Thor, there is no doubt in watching this movie that Chris Hemsworth does an awesome job as James Hunt, easily matching the charisma of the great character, who was both a charmer and a legendary womanizer, and that Hemsworth is a great star.  I consider this to be his best role to date.

The title Rush is quite appropriate as you may experience a certain rush of adrenaline in watching the movie.

I think the movie in a way balances perfectly, because if you are like me, as you watch, clearly as a social guy Hunt steals the show, and as a technical and methodical racer, Lauda is superior.  In a way they come across as total opposites, yet at the end one does admire both, Lauda for his heroic comeback showing what a true competitor he is, and Hunt for his charisma and skill.

Rush is jam packed with interesting events.  You do not need I think to know much about movie going in, just allow it to rush over you.

I won't go through the premise here.  If you're reading this I expect you already know it.  I will say that this film travels at a pace akin to the cars it features.  There's not a moment to get bored or for the mind to wander.  To the contrary.  I wanted every scene to be longer, I wanted to spend more time with these people.  I was hungry to know them, flaws and all.  This is no glossed up little package of hero-worship.  Both Hunt and Lauda are as selfish and spiteful as they are inspiring and talented.

The music is brooding, compelling and exciting by turn.  The camera work is intimate and amazing.  (You see through Niki's bury eyes, you see from inside helmets and from under and along the cars.  You see every shudder they make.  You see eyelashes and pores and ruined skin as well as stunning scenery.  You struggle to see through the rain.  You see through the flames, you see and hear what Lauda saw and head in that fiery minute (and sit glad you can't feel it).

I wasn't sure how I'd take the most confronting action, the crash and the painful hospital scenes and I admit going into it a little apprehensive.  They aren't easy watching but neither are they overdone.  It's all very matter-of-fact. Horrible but nothing that can't be pushed through.  Not lingered on, not brushed over and I was glad for it. It had to be done that way to understand what Lauda actually overcame.

While the race action was outstanding the best part, of course, was the interaction between Hunt and Lauda.  Every scene between them was charged (and in my opinion mostly too brief).  I could have watched those two talking for the whole running time.  Their dynamic is fascinating, the place they played in each others lives and careers slowly unfolds as you come to know them both and understand that each would likely have been something a little less without the other.  Despite people comparing them to Prost and Senna almost incessantly, by the end they reminded me much more of Senna and Berger, one serious and driven, the other understanding the vital importance of adding a little fun.  Both pairs added a similar balance to each others existence.

Bruhl and Hemsworth are pitch perfect (as are everyone involved).  I wasn't surprised on Bruhl's front but it's hard to get from the preview the depth that Hemsworth would have to work with.  Happily he found those depths and plundered them.  There is so much more to his Hunt than a womanising baffoon, as their should be.  This is a key role for both actors but especially to showcase the serious acting skill that Hemsworth hasn't had so much of a chance to display.  The preview actually hinted at a more one dimensional take but it was good to see the serious side of James and Niki's little sparks of humour and delight too (played to perfection).  I ended up caring a great deal for these characters, warts and all.  This is one film I would line up to get an extended edition of but it also sparked my interested in finding out more about these characters.  It's not a documentary, things have been changed, Hunt and Lauda have been polarised a but more than they were in reality, but it's still damn good fun and has real history to depart as well.

Of course the final recommendation is the most important.  Niki Lauda himself was very pleased with the outcome.  That is good enough for me.",1380758400,99,3599,4.5092879256965945
5592528,5,B00BEIYP1W,"I walked in to the cinema knowing little about the plot of the film. All I knew was that it was based on true F1 events and directed by Ron Howard. Oh my God! what a knock out this movie turned out to be.

Ron Howard is at the top of his game here. As a director, it would have been very easy to to get lost in the racing sequences but Howard being the master he is, knew he had a human story to tell. Excellent performances by the cast and another adrelanine pumping soundtrack by Hans Zimmer made this my best cinema experience of this year so far. This is sure to elate your spirits.

One word of advice though, after watching the film, just be easy on the pedal while driving back home.",1380672000,7,690,4.0661764705882355
5592529,5,B00BEIYP1W,"In many ways Rush was nothing like what I expected.  When I think of driving/racing movies I think of The Transporter (2002), Fast Five (2011), Driven (2001) or Drive (2011).  While these movies vary wildly in quality (some action movies, a competitive bro flick and a one legit film), they all have VERY exciting driving scenes.  These movies also feature some aging bro-mentor meets wildcard rookie moments (Driven), intense stoic Albert Brooks and head stomping scenes (Driven), some serious jump spin kicks bringing Hong Kong cinema to America (The Transporter) and an international pec dance-off between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (Fast Five).  Sure, there are some heavy moments surrounding the driving scenes in all these movies.  But, far to the contrary, Rush's driving scenes were the least exciting scenes of the entire film...and in no way is this to the film's detriment.

Rush chronicles the ascension of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth, deflated from his Thor role) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl) from their humble Formula 3 beginnings up to the contentious glory of Formula One.  Their actions and dialogue, whether to, about or because of one another, illustrate their dependence on each other which subsequently fuels their  addiction to competition.  Each minute of this movie is every bit a duel as Rocky versus Ivan Drago and they bring out the very best (and the very worst) in each other.

But this ""race car"" movie hardly focuses on ""action"" or ""racing"" at all.  But it is every bit about the intensity ""of"" the race...and the rush experienced by its competitors.  This film is about the relationship and rivalry between of Hunt and Lauda, not the engines behind which they sit.  As such, while almost every scene is effective and elicits sneers, gasps, laughs or sympathy--none of the major action or excitement takes place while the cars are actually moving.  Quite to the contrary, the drivers rev their engines and scream around the track as Hans Zimmer's soulful score builds to something powerful.  However, the crescendo is not found in gasp-worthy maneuvers or photo finishes.  It's what happens when the cars ""aren't"" racing that is exciting.  The drama and humor finds us ""before"" setting foot in the car.  Frustrations and conflict are expressed when the cars pit.  And your greatest shock occurs not in anticipation of a crash, nor at the devastating contact of it.  No...  The heaviest moments in this film occur during the 90 seconds ""after"" the collision that leads to the crash and ""after"" the car has come to a complete stop!  Yet more intensity is found as Lauda perseveres and recovers from irrecoverable injuries driven to resume his race against Hunt for the 1976 championship.  You may not find it with the wind blowing through your hair on a sun-soaked day, but you will feel the rush and see the magnitude of the races through a different lens altogether.

But still, the cinematography does its part, seizing the drivers' hesitation with stunning rainy competition shots, speeding fish-eye lens framing and grounded POV angles.

Playing the three-time champ Lauda, Daniel Brhl masters his role as the rigid, obsessive, friendless and charmless Austrian.  His tactful brilliance oozed a preternaturally meticulous fluency of all things racing--from track to engine and from the car to the man.  Lauda's complete opposite, Chris Hemsworth champions the devilishly charming Brit, James Hunt.  Whereas Lauda remains determined, never letting his victories blur his focus, Hunt basks in international success, sexual conquest and alcoholic bliss.  It's a wonder his cause of death wasn't being crushed to death under a pile of beautiful women.  The press and the ladies alike adore this dashing silver-tongued hero.

A cameo by Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones) swiftly ignites the screen with Hunt's sexuality.  But as the film shifts from ascension to harsh conflict, Olivia Wilde assume the role of supermodel Suzy Miller.  As Hunt's wife, however briefly and tragic their marriage, she serves as little more than an emotionless frame depicting from within the image of Hunt's downward spiral.  Serving quite a different purpose as Marlene Lauda, Alexandra Maria Lara breathes life into Niki Lauda, humanizing his otherwise coarse persona and bringing him to the realization that greater happiness can be found off the track than forever chasing the next technical victory on the horizon.  Without her, he'd never truly understand the ""sacrifices"" he so vehemently preaches to Hunt--or when they mount to high.

This is a film that will make you ""feel.""  You'll traverse most emotions of the human spectrum.  But most importantly, the start and the finish will find you feeling elated.",1380585600,60,4728,5.140052356020942
5592530,4,B00BEIYP1W,"Any racing fan will tell you that racing is only as interesting as the rivalries between the drivers.  This should come as no surprise since rivalry prompts individual drive, forcing the competitors to be on the top of their game - with the ultimate goal of victory.  Just a few of the countless and illustrious rivalries in the world of motorsports has included both driver and manufacturer.  On the manufacturing side, there has almost always been a long standing competition between the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro.  Once you move on from the manufacturer rivalry, there are team rivalries, one of which is the ongoing feud between Hendrick Motorsports and Penske Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, a feud that began when the series was still known as the Winston Cup Series.  And, since we're talking about the Winston Cup Series, it's absolutely impossible to forget the rich and always entertaining feud between Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon.  However, before the Earnhardt met Gordon, possibly the greatest rivalry in all of racing had already taken place - in the Formula One Series.  Of course, this rivalry - between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is the subject of the new biopic, Rush.

Hollywood legend Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, The Da Vinci Code) directs Rush, the parallel true story about Formula One race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brhl) in the 1970s.  Hunt is a womanizing playboy, reckless behind the wheel, and egotistical to the max - but he knows how to win races.  On the flip side, Lauda is a ""straight edge"" driver that focuses solely on winning.  At the height of his career, Hunt first experiences Lauda as he buys his way into racing, quickly making a name for himself by winning an F1 champion - at Hunt's expense, of course.  With each passing race, the two drivers intertwine with one another more and more, often trading wins - at least until an unfortunate accident sidelines Lauda, essentially changing their relationship forever.  Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara, and Pierfrancesco Favino also star in supporting roles.

Depending how you feel about racing and motorsports, this film has the potential to either feel like a high-octane trip down memory lane or like watching cars simply drive in a circle for two hours (the equivalent for some of watching paint dry).  Honestly, and this comes from someone that grew up during the era of Earnhardt/Gordon - it can be a bit of both.  If you're hoping for constant wreckage and fistfights between Hunt and Lauda, you're going to be massively disappointed.  That's not who these guys were, and their relationship was not as aggressive as the rivalries between Earnhardt and Gordon or the current petty fights between countless drivers all over modern motorsports.  It would be impossible to describe the relationship between Hunt and Lauda as a gentlemen's relationship, but it's not as though they hated each other either.  In fact, it would appear that they despised each other far more in this film than in real life.  However you'd describe their relationship, it was certainly entertaining and a big deal for the F1 Series.

Without a doubt, Rush is dominated by the onscreen presence of Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brhl.  Not only do the characters portrayed in this film push one another to greatness, but these two exquisite actors also push each other, endlessly feeding thriving in their respective roles.  Hemsworth portrays a brash, borderline alcoholic that loves the limelight, while Brhl is calm, collected and ready for business.  The egos of these two characters may be on the opposite side of the spectrum in terms of how they go about their lives off the track, but on the track - there might be no better pair to mirror one another in the history of motorsports. On the outside, their relationship may have appeared to be of the tumultuous variety, but this film portrays them as men desperate to out due one another on the track.  There's a great deal of admiration for men like that.

Obviously, since Rush is centered squarely on two men, it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for supporting characters to make an impression.  This will come as disappointing news for Oliva Wilde fans, as she only briefly appears in the film - as Hunt's wife and eventual ex-wife.  Although she can be a compelling actress (based on certain roles), she isn't allotted the time to leave a meaningful impression.  However, Wilde's counterpart, Alexandra Maria Lara, portrays Niki Lauda's wife - and is present for much more emotional and engaging scenes.  Through sheer silly luck, Lara's character meets her future husband as she's leaving a party, and from there, her character is enthralled with Niki's drive and passion for racing.  The complexity of the Lauda marriage is given far more screen time, while the Hunt marriage is depicted as nothing more than a brief shame, in an attempt to give James Hunt a more acceptable public appearance.  In defense of the film's lopsidedness, James Hunt does spend much of his time womanizing rather than romancing.

For anyone that's a fan of the 1990 racing flick Days of Thunder, you might just enjoy Rush as much, possibly more - unless you have a bias for stock cars over open wheel cars.  It's brutally obvious that a comparison to Days of Thunder and Rush is not fair (based on the overall quality of the completed products), but you can't help but look at the storyline involved with each film and see some familiar parallels.  Both focus on egotistical men, followed by a tragic accident that defines the film, and finally, each flick ultimately ends in a positive nature.  The quality of acting in Rush is far more impressive than in Days of Thunder, but it's hard not to look at Rush as something more than Thor womanizing, drinking, and trying to play Tom Cruise.  This shouldn't take away from the performance of Hemsworth, but as far as the entertainment value goes, it feels like there should be an asterisk next to Rush - since it obviously came nearly 25 years later, yet still resembling a similar story.

Overall, Rush is a biopic that tells an interesting story, but does it using a plot that still feels far too familiar.  Unfortunately, the real life relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda was not as dramatic as it's made out to be in the film.  Still, Director Ron Howard creates a nice, free flowing film that rivals his work on his previous accolades, including Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.  With quite a bit of Oscar buzz around it, the question becomes:  is Rush a serious Oscar contender?  If Rush can remain relevant despite peaking early, it should be appear to climb its way into contention.  Although a high entertainment value is present in this film, very little about it screams Academy Award.

Howard was brilliant to cast Hemsworth also as the bad boy racer who smiles and charms his way in most scenes as the real character did in life. The race scenes got my adrenaline going too, the sound of the engines roaring was amazing. This is real drama. Well done, Ron! You should've hauled in Oscars for Cinderella Man by the way...",1380499200,4,681,4.456
5592533,4,B00BEIYP1W,"Theatrical review.

Ron Howard, like most directors, has had his share of hits and misses.  His one previous ""sports"" movie was the underappreciated ""Cinderella Man"" from 2005.  He takes another stab with this exhilarating film which depicts the competition between two men who are polar opposites except in their desire to win.  Winning means taking the Formula 1 driving championship of 1976.

Based on real characters and real events, Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") plays British playboy James Hunt.  His nemesis is unlikeable and demanding, but determined and detailed.  Austrian driver, Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, ""Inglourious Basterds"") is more focused on the curves of the race course than on the curves on a woman.  We see the two drivers beginning in the smaller F3 circuit.  But both are impatient.  Lauda has access to money and buys his way in to F1 with his investment.  Hunt is sponsored by British Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay), a man with money but even he has his limits.  Two women enter their lives.  Model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) eventually becomes Mrs. Hunt.  And why not?  I couldn't help but think I've not seen 2 more beautiful people on screen at one time than Hemsworth and Wilde.  I digress.  By accident, the unpopular Lauda meets Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), a romantic partner of actor Curd Jurgens.  Marlene becomes a strong influence on Niki, eventually bringing out a more humanistic side, especially after his near fatal crash.  Suzy and James are in a crash and burn relationship of a different kind.

This movie, however is about the relationship and the competitive nature between Hunt and Lauda.  That is their one link.  Competition.  It brings out the best and the worst of each.  Hemsworth and Bruhl give terrific performances.  Howard, aided by Peter Morgan's screenplay gives cautioned insight into what makes each man tick.  It's a simple story really.  Each motivates the other.  Each wants to be the best.  Their approaches are different and they are certainly of different personalities.  Hunt is gifted, popular and loves the life that goes with the job.  For Lauda, less athletic perhaps, but uses the science of the sport and strong work ethic to become better.

Hans Zimmer adds a very good musical score to the film and the editing is first rate.  I would also be remiss if not mentioning the spectacular racing scenes shot by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle.  They are numerous and even for someone not particularly interesting in auto racing, exciting and spectacular.  There are never two races that seem the same, either from the way they are shot or by the racing environment.  The races shot during driving rain storms are harrowing.  Find yourself a great seat in the middle and in front of a big screen and engulf yourself with as many speakers as you can find.  It's a great ride.",1380499200,9,2844,4.93446088794926
5592534,4,B00BEIYP1W,"If you're familiar with the 70's era Formula One rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt then ""Rush"" may not hold too many surprises for you. My guess is, if you are familiar with the story, you are in the minority. So, Ron Howard's biographical film may have been a really great choice for a story to tell. Those in Europe may be acutely familiar with it but even they may not have heard the intricate details behind the scenes that made up one of the most bitter racing rivalries in history.

The casting of the title characters was spot on and I only know this based on the real footage of the two personalities at the end of the film and the story that was told. James Hunt was a blonde-haired playboy with a lust for testing life, partying and women. So, ""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth was a perfect fit for the part. Niki Lauda was a small perfectionist with an overbite and was played by German actor Daniel Bruhl. Combine two well cast actors with a juicy story, rivalry, fast moving cars and one of the best storytelling directors in Hollywood and ""Rush"" has all the right ingredients.

First and foremost, ""Rush"" is not ""Days of Thunder"" or ""Fast and Furious"". I was more taken by the storyline and acting than I was the racing sequences. I found the racing sequences to be a little disappointing for the most part. They were few and far between and much of what made Niki Lauda and James Hunt despise each other so much was because of what happened between them on the race track. This was all portrayed, but much of what made ""Rush"" a good movie was as I stated before; Ron Howard, being a great storyteller.

Not having the slightest idea of what happened between Hunt and Lauda, I found myself completely involved in their conflicted and conflicting personalities. The 1976 Formula One season was a life changer for both men and that is what the movie focuses on; one year, one season of their lives. I would only recommend that you go to see ""Rush"" for the story and the drama because if you're going to be dazzled by dynamic racing sequences, you'll be disappointed. To me, this was the weakest part of the film, but fortunately there was an amazing story to tell about the human spirit, the value of life and the risks that race car drivers take when they get behind the wheel for the sake of sport and fame.",1380499200,5,2321,4.456470588235294

5592536,4,B00BEIYP1W,"""Rush"" (2013 release; 122 min.) portrays the rivalry between legendary Austrian F1 driver Niki Lauda, and British driver James Hunt. As the movie opens, we see how both Luda and Hunt are rejected by their own families when they choose to become a professional race car driver, yet both persevere and manage to break through. Their rivalry starts at the F3 level (call it the minor leagues of F1 racing) in 1970. It is not long before we see them competing at the highest level, and it all leads to the 1976 season, where things would come to a head. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, director Ron Howard deserves a ton of credit for faithfully and painstakingly recreating what life was like in Europe in the early 70s, both on the race track and off the race track. I mean, it is spot-on. Howard also manages to overcome the challenge of how to bring a riveting sports movie when you already know how it all ends (maybe not so much in the US, where interest in and audiences for F1 racing are not nearly as big as the rest of the world). Second, the lead actors Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Brhl as Niki Lauda are terrific. I am floored to see that only Hemsworth (as Hunt) is on the DVD jacket of this movie, as it is as much the story of Lauda, if not more so, than Hunt's. Apart from these two, there are several smaller roles that are worth noting, none more so that Olivier Wilde as Hunt's girlfriend/eventual wife. There is also a very nice soundtrack for this movie, including the original score (by veteran Hans Zimmer), but also plenty of early 70s music which you will immediately recognize if you grew up in that era (such as Mud's Dyna-Mite, Slade's We're All Crazy Now, Thin Lizzy's The Rocker, etc).

Can this movie appeal to a large US audience that is not necessarily interested in or familiar with Formula One racing from 40 years ago?  I am not your typical US movie goer, as I grew up in Belgium and seeing this movie was like being transported back in time. I turned 16 on the very day of the Nrburgrin accident (I will never forget that). That said, I was (pleasantly) surprised that the screening I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was packed! On top of that, there was applause from the audience when the end credits started to roll. I'm not sure if this is indicative of the overall box office chances but I sure hope so. If you like a riveting sports drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, you cannot go wrong with this.
