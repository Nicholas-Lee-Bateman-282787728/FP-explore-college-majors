7874480,4,6304561865,"These are from the early days when the show was very much centered on Bart, and both stories reveolve around him, as he is sent on an exchange programme to Frnce only to treated badly by 2 wine growers, and in the second episodes is heartbroken when his hero Krusty the Clown is jailed for armed robbery, and sets out to prove that he was framed. This episode sees the beginning of Kelsey 'Frasier' Grammer's occasional role as Sideshow Bob, which is hilarious. Crepe's Of Wrath's further story of the ALbabnian kid living with the Simpsons is outdated, harking back to COmmunsim, but still kinda funny. The best scene is this video ahs to be when Bart is trying to talk to the French police officer, is unable to speak French, and then suddenly manages it. Formidable!",974678400,3,769,4.62043795620438

Both episodes were really funny and prove that The Simpsons is one of the  best shows on television!",943488000,3,244,4.191489361702128
