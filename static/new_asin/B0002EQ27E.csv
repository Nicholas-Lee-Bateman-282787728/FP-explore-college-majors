8027325,5,B0002EQ27E,"My mom bought this workout for me years ago and I have to say it's the best workout I ever encountered. Shedding 60+ lbs at the time was motivating. Then while I left it in the VCR, it was recorded over. I was bummed when I gained weight again, however, I didn't believe anything else was more effective as this video. As an adult, I bought it again and I must say it has brought back that spark to lose weight again. Just looking forward to it in DVD format, no matter how old it is.",1501632000,,484,4.052083333333333

8027329,5,B0002EQ27E,"I agree with Angela about ""whipping one back into shape in 30 minutes"". I bought this video 17 years ago after I gave birth to my 3rd son and I needed a quick work-out. This video did the trick; Quick & effective. Throughout the years, I lost the video so I bought a second one. Recently, I moved and lost my tape in the move so I just purchased my 3rd copy. :)",1348790400,,361,3.958904109589041
8027330,5,B0002EQ27E,"I bought this VHS when it first came out and used it for years to keep in shape.  Every time I gained a little weight, I'd pop it in.  With the advent of DVD it got lost.  I've gained more than a little weight recently and decided to try and find my tried and true video.  After doing it just once, I realize why I was in such great shape when I was using it with wrist and ankle weights.  Without any weights, I could get through half the upper body, a third of the legs, and barely any of the killer ab workout.  I was huffing and puffing all through it.  I've tried all types of DVD's from Denise Austin, The Firm, Yoga, Pilates, even Sweatin' to the Oldies.  This is the only video I kept coming back to for a great total body workout in only 30 minutes.",1231372800,4,758,4.006666666666667
