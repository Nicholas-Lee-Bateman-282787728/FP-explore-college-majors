8203756,5,B000S1FXJY,Great video! Best to beginners who have never done Zumba. The video was made back in 2000 or so. But you still a great workout. I honestly like this better than the new Zumba.,1486771200,,175,4.176470588235294
8203757,2,B000S1FXJY,"This appeared to be a really low budget video. It was nothing like the Zhumba videos I've seen advertised on TV. If you want to learn Zhumba, this is not the tape for you.",1347667200,,171,4.0588235294117645
8203758,4,B000S1FXJY,It's a great workout.  The moves are just right for beginners.  It gets your heart rate up and pumping! I liked the tape a lot.,1324166400,,127,4.04
8203759,1,B000S1FXJY,"I ordered a Zumba Beginners VHS tape to use on my vcr, but received a dvd instead. I wrote to the Alpha Store site explaining the problem. It has been a couple weeks now and I have not heard anything. I have always been satisfied with my Amazon orders and am sure this can be resolved.",1302048000,6,285,4.107142857142857
8203760,5,B000S1FXJY,The tape is just what I was looking for. It is only 30 minutes long so it is easy to fit into a busy schedule. It is easy enough for a new zumba learner to grasp easily.,1290816000,17,169,3.5945945945945947
8203761,4,B000S1FXJY,Overall the tape is good but the quality (as you would expect from a VHS) is not that great!  Shipper was reliable and prompt in sending the product.,1233705600,15,149,4.321428571428571
8203762,5,B000S1FXJY,This Zumba video is lots of fun~ and I know it will help shed pounds!,1230422400,11,69,3.6666666666666665
