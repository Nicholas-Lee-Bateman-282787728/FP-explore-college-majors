2832354,4,B000Q677HC,"THE BLOSSOMING OF MAXIMO OLIVEROS (Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros) is a fine little surprise of a film, a film honored in many festivals yet one that has not had the theater life in the US that it deserves. Perhaps one of the major reasons for this lack of public recognition is the manner in which it has been promoted: the cover and comments suggests that this is a comic gay film about a cross-dressing teenager and that is simply not the meaning. This very sensitive verismo story, written with skill by  Michiko Yamamoto, is a window into the life of a Filipino family living in the poverty section of Manila, a family of a father and three sons after the death of the mother figure, now supporting themselves on income from petty crimes.

The youngest of these is Maximo (Nathan Lopez) who has assumed the mother's role in the household.  Yes, he is effeminate, associates with others his age in private drag shows, but he is completely respected and loved by his father and two brothers who are grateful for the feminine role Maximo is filling.  Because numbers games and selling stolen cell phones, etc. are the support of the family, naturally crimes are noticed by the police, most of whom can be paid off.  Yet a new young and handsome recruit Victor (J.R. Valentin) moves into the neighborhood control and soon is protecting Maximo from bashing incidents and thus getting to know the family.  Maximo sees Victor as a kind alternative man who represents a path out of poverty and crime and despite the age difference between the two, a tender relationship ensues: Victor protects Maximo, and Maximo nurtures the beaten Victor. And there is a beautiful very pure love relationship between these two that never borders on the physical.

Tragedies are expected in this life and when they hit Maximo's family there are ramifications that follow, incidents that alter the way the family interacts and the way the relationship between Victor and Maximo changes.  In a moment of sensitive storytelling the film ends with a surprising and illuminating gesture.

Director Auraeus Solito knows how to push the story along, allowing us to view and understand what levels of poverty can drive people to do, and how important family bonds are in a society that is crippled by assaults from misunderstood events.  The actors are all very natural - Nathan Lopez is able to capture our hearts as is JR Valentin as his 'hero' - and the family as portrayed by Soliman Cruz, Ping Medina, and Bodjie Pascua are well developed people with whom we can empathize despite their lives of crime. The cinematography by Nap Jamir is appropriately gritty and the musical score by Pepe Smith and Mike Villegas is primarily a solo guitar with occasional very beautiful vocal songs inserted.  This is an important little film that has the courage to leave the meaning of the title, THE BLOSSOMING OF MAXIMO OLIVEROS, to the viewer.  In Tagalog and English with subtitles.

2832355,5,B000Q677HC,"This moving coming of age movie about about a 12 year boy's puppy love for a young cop had this big tough guy bawling like a baby.

Maxi---played by Nathan Lopez---is a sensitive 12-year-old boy whose life has deteriorated into a surrogate existence of his dead mother. Relegated to housekeeping and caring for his criminal father and brothers, Maxi becomes infatuated with a kind and honorable policeman---played by J.R. Valentin. The policeman responds to the boy's infatuation compassionately but behaves responsibly by gently refusing sexual contact. Instead, he befriends Maxi and tries to steer him to a more respectable way of life. But his relationship with Maxi and his family has an unexpected and tragic result.

Did Maxi blossom? Yes, in a big way! Not only did Maxi take his mother's place cooking and cleaning, but he also becomes the heart of his family. It was his big heart that moves his brothers into the future after the tragedy that occurs to the family during the movie.

Turn off the cable TV and watch this quirky, little movie from the Philippines. It's a classic coming-of-age movie that will move and inspire you.",1190592000,60,1140,4.927083333333333
2832356,5,B000Q677HC,"I have wanted to see this for a while but reviews across the web were varied. I finally broke down and bought the DVD; I am glad I did. I was honestly surprised how good this movie was. I wasn't expecting the level of class that Max's character was allowed to have nor was I expecting the drama surrounding Max's family and the law. Few movies keep me entertained and captivated to the end, The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros did just that and more.",1189036800,7,448,4.345238095238095
2832357,5,B000Q677HC,"THE BLOSSOMING OF MAXIMO OLIVEROS is masterful on so many levels.  One, it's a coming-of-age story expertly structured.  Its dramatic momentum, its turning of the screw, is gripping.  Motivations are complicated, outcomes surprising.  Two, its rendering of Manila is honest, raw, personal, and illuminating.  It captures both the hope and the desperation of life in a third world slum.  It shows the beauty co-existing with the sludge.  It does so without varnish, and without sentimentality.  Three, it explores sexual identity in a fresh way.  It's been on the festival circuit for a couple of years, selling out everywhere it plays.  I'm thrilled to see it's finally released on dvd.",1188345600,17,686,5.2110091743119265
2832368,5,B000Q677HC,"Typical of excellent Filipino films--richly human and humane, with profoundly realized characters in morally complex situations.  The 12-year-old Maxi lives with his father and two brothers in a Manila slum.  His mother died when he was very young, and he has replaced, doing the cooking, cleaning, and sewing, and adopting the behavior of a female (his brothers teasingly but lovingly call him ""sister,"" and his father accepts him lovingly and without a trace of criticism).  The family business is theft.  A young and handsome policeman comes to the local precinct and begins doing his job without corruption.  One of the brothers commits a murder, to the utter horror of his father, and the policeman tries to get Maxi, who has fallen completely in love with him, to inform on his brothers.  The drama unfolds as Maxi and the young policeman's relation grows in complexity and anguish.  The resolution is painful, but the film ends not on a note of despair but one of hope, as Maxi walks past the policeman on his way to school and slows, but without turning around.  One senses that perhaps they can overcome their painful history with time.  A wonderful and strange image is the character of a drunken, wretchedly thin piano player who tries to bang out music on a completely dilapidated, broken piano--a symbol of the desperate desire to make something moving and beautiful out of the impossible conditions of life.  Maxi asks his father the central, painful question of the film: ""Why do we have to live like this?""  Nathan Lopez is brilliant as Maxi, and the other actors are outstanding as well.  Highly recommended.  Tagalog with subtitles.",1384646400,3,1650,4.934782608695652

2832371,5,B000Q677HC,"Nathan Lopez did a great job as Maximo Oliveros. This is not quite what I expected from a gay movie. The middle part of the movie had crimes of stealing and murder. The stealing was there way of providing an income for the household. Maxi in this movie had an effeminate role of putting on makeup and being the housekeeper of the tiny apartment in the Phillipines. I think that Maxi had learned to grow up. there was a sweet ending where he finally went to school. This is a movie that is not for everyone, but it was a good one.",1324684800,,529,4.196078431372549
2832372,5,B000Q677HC,"This movie is not about sex, and not really about violence.  It is about a way of life foreign to most of us, thank goodness, but very real to many.  Maximo is incredibly played.  The emotional range this kid has to show is disturbing.  His tentative attempt to reach out to a policeman falters near the end (no spoilers here), but this simply makes his growth more impressive.  I loved it.",1300579200,,390,4.436619718309859
2832373,5,B000Q677HC,"This film will transport you to a colorful slum neighborhood in The Phillipines, where you will meet Maxi, a 12 year-old feminine boy, and the ragtag cast of characters who surround him.  When I began to watch this movie, I simply was not prepared for the potent emotional experience that it turned out to be.  The viewer becomes absolutely immersed in the poignant intimate moments that Maxi experiences as the vibrant life of the city swirls around him.

This movie offers the viewer numerous moments of giddy lightness as well as several scenes of intense sorrow and violence.  I believe that these elements of light and dark balance each other very nicely.  We see Maxi lively and happy and carefree but we also see him suffer and cry.  Nathan Lopez, who portrays Maxi, gets every moment right.  By the time the movie ends, we feel that we know this boy very well and that we have shared many important experiences with him.

Most of the dialogue is spoken in the local Filipino dialect, with just a smidgen of English thrown in.  The subtitles are not intrusive and I had no difficulty keeping up with the story.

This is a great film on a very small scale.  Seeing this movie will serve to freshen up your perspective on life.  You will feel good and you will feel different.",1275436800,,1281,4.594713656387666

2832375,2,B000Q677HC,"Very disappointing, the story has potential but the film fails to deliver more than a few nuggets.

Acting was poor.  Story was not believable.

I expected a warm coming of age story about a typical gay pre-teen growing up in the slums of Manila.  It does a reasonable job of depicting the slums, poverty, petty thievery, family bonds, and corruption of the police.  But I just can't believe the main character.  He is off the scale effeminate gay; I found it difficult to believe this character would survive in the surroundings he existed in.  I have never seen a boy behave like he did or dress in this way - I just found him hard to believe, not genuine, more like an over-acted stereotype.  It didn't work for me.

Poor acting, poorly written script, and characters not believable......I was really disappointed.",1262131200,4,817,4.73758865248227
2832376,5,B000Q677HC,"I cannot say enough good about this picture from the Philippines. This story of a gay boy who bonds with the cop who is out to destroy his family is in Tagalog with subtitles.

In the end Maximo does seem to get things going to here he is on his way to find a lover/friend. It's worth watching again and again, but if an x-rating is needed then this is not the one.",1230076800,2,483,3.938775510204082
2832378,5,B000Q677HC,"Frankly, I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, since lady-boys are not at all my type (much less 12yo lady-boys).  But, just as a person, the 12yo lady-boy won my heart.

And that is perhaps the crucial thing about this film.  Folks who come prepared to condescend will likely wind up wishing they knew more people like Maxi.  Sure, he's an effeminate gay boy, and he's only 12, but... how to put it?....he's a great guy, sincere, affectionate, hard-working, and his dreams are firmly fixed on the stars.  To sum it up: he's a believable character, and very sympathetic.

Now you have to get ready for the ""Romeo & Juliet"" part of the story.  Maxi lives with a family of criminals, and he falls madly in love with an honest cop.  To say any more would spoil the story, except that I will say this: the story is about love, not about sex.  In the end, both Maxi and Victor have been seen in tears.  The affection is very real.

Frankly, I don't regard this as a ""quirky little film.""  It is a film about real human feelings. (When I was living in Iran, I had the same experience of a young boy falling in love with me!  It happened during a vacation trip, and so it was short, but neither of us ever forgot it.) I don't think I need to repeat myself, but it was all about affection, and never about everyone's favorite subject.  The last I heard, a dozen years later, Arman was in medical school --- and I was overjoyed to hear it.

In precisely the same way, Maxi and Victor come to care for one another, and to care ABOUT one another.

And that's really what life is about.",1227830400,7,1575,4.3061224489795915
2832379,3,B000Q677HC,"The main reason to recommend watching this coming-of-age film from the Phillippines is the main character of Maximo Oliveros, an unashamedly femininine 12-year-old boy growing up in the slums and fulfilling ""wife"" duties (cooking, cleaning) to his family of crooks (widowed dad and two brothers) when he unwisely develops a crush for a hunky policeman amused by his attention.  Its the type of character you never see in gay-themed movies and the early family scenes and especially the scenes between the cop and the boy, basically a series of innocent flirtations which begin to take on a potentially dangerous erotic tone, are very well made.  However, cinematically, the movie shows its low budget and the director's inexperience with narrative film.  The plot degenerates by the third part of the film, falling into crime melodrama, and the last scene, a nod to The Third Man, is inconsistent with character development.  Still, the film is well worth a rental, since the quality of TLA DVDs is really not worth the money and Im not sure about repeated viewings of this film.",1214265600,5,1079,5.011173184357542
2832380,5,B000Q677HC,"In reading the prior reviews and descriptions of this movie I was not prepared for what an intense drama it really was.  Wow.

There are not may movies which would dare to depict a 12 year old boy as truly transgendered and accepted as such by his family, friends and neighbors.  His two older brothers even refer to him as their ""sister.""  Most other movies of the ""gay coming-of-age"" variety show boys encountering their gayness for the first time as masculine, or pretending to be masculine, as their parents and peers try to steer them in the traditional straight/masculine direction.  Not Maximo.  He acts and dresses like a girl and takes care of the men in his family as if he were female.  He adores them and they adore him just as he is.  When he does get bullied and threatened with rape by older thugs, his brothers come to the rescue (maybe a little too zealously as it turns out).

In the beginning of the movie and for the first 40 minutes or so, we see Maximo at his most carefree and innocent.  He plays games (mostly with girls), dresses up, watches movies, and models exotic women's clothes on a pretend runway.  He falls in love with a handsome and kind 20 something policeman.  All is well with the world.  But as the story unravels we learn secrets about Maximo's family, and especially his father, that force Maximo to question his sense of right and wrong, his view of the world as black/white and good/evil.  We also learn things about his policeman/pseudo lover.  Everything begins to take on shades of gray and Maximo must choose his loyalties and in the process lose his innocence, and I don't mean sexually.  Suddenly, his sexuality takes a back seat to other aspects of life which are universal to everybody, men/women, boys/girls, gay/straight or masculine/effeminate namely loyalty toward family vs. loyalty toward a love interest.  It also forces Maximo, and the viewer, to question the acceptable boundaries of behavior/misdeeds you can overlook in a parent, brother, friend or lover, in order to continue to maintain a relationship with them, and which ones you can't.

The acting was excellent.  I believed everyone in their rolls.  The main characters were all well written and 3-dimensional.  This movie will stay with you for a long time.  It is extraordinary.  I highly recommend it as a purchase as opposed to a rental because you will want to watch it more then once and share this unique experience with others.",1213142400,16,2453,4.760663507109005
2832381,5,B000Q677HC,"While I realize this movie may not be for everyone I can only say I really enjoyed it.  Maxi is a 12 year old who emulates his dead Mother by taking care of his family by doing the cleaning, ironing, cooking, etc.  He is very effeminate and obviously not interested in girls.  However I found nothing sexual about the movie and moreover we are concerned with Maxi and his family's way of life.
 Maxi meets a police officer who befriends him and tries to set him on a better path than the one his family is following.  There are truly some funny scenes here and also more than one heartbreaking scene that had the tears coming down my face.  This film is not only about the Blossoming of the young Maxi but also his family and the impact the police officer has on all of that, and I was as happy with the ending as the rest of the film.  A unique coming of age story.",1206835200,6,866,4.180722891566265

2832383,4,B000Q677HC,"I wasn't sure what I was getting here.  Was worried that it was more dodgy than it turned out to be. This was quite delightful - has a sad ending for you romantics out there like me...just an early warning for you.  I like that the family not only accept Maximo's sexuality but cherish and encourage him.  There is no shame - just support and protectiveness.  The family are a ""successful"" crime family - living quite a nice life in their neighbourhood.  Well for them it seems a nice life...not for me that's for sure.  Maximo (Nathan Lopez) was played so well, utterly beautiful in the delivery of his character. In comes the new cop - strong, brave, handsome and not corrupt.  The latter seems to be unusual in this place.  Maxi falls into an infatuation - worrying the family who have much to hide.  Unfortunately things become as bad as they can.  Won't ruin it for you.  However, the cop turns out to be not so brave and easily corruptible for the cause (stopping crime and seeking vengeance).  Nothing happens between Maxi and the cop, nothing sexual I mean.  Emotionally the boy is more mature, he puts himself out there and is rebuffed.  Later on the cop seeks out the boy but the boy has become a man - straight or gay I am not sure.  But strong enough to say no to someone he may still love but who is not the man he thought he was - who is not worthy.  Sad, funny, lovable, sad, full of hope and acceptance is how I would sum this up.  I love a happy ending - boy gets girl, boy gets boy or whoever gets whoever they want.  This isn't it, but it didn't seem to matter, which is very unusual for me.  Enjoy:0)",1201478400,6,1620,4.269736842105263

2832386,3,B000Q677HC,"This is not your ordinary gay movie. Caution should be given to those who want to get this movie, as it is about a very young child (12) finding friendship and love in the most unlikely places.

The story line is about the growing up of a very feminine boy. It is set in the Philippines, primarily in the slums of Manila. The movie, is not only a good lesson on an impoverished culture, but on the unity of a family, how they fully accept what he is, even is made up of rough, straight brothers and father.

Maxi, Nathan Lopez, belongs to small neighborly group of boys who are extremely feminine, acting very much like girls. He is a school dropout as other boys pick on him for what he is. He is well liked, both by his family, and other neighbors. He assumes the role of a dead mother in his home, takes care of his father and bothers, he does the cooking, cleaning, and mending around their impoverished home. In turns, they protect him. It is interesting how these rough guys accept him as a girl and encourages him. People can learn from this movie by how a family can function well with a gay member.

Maxi meets a young new cop who moves into the local precinct. Victor, JR. Valentin, befriends this sweet boy, and Maxi develops his first crush. Maxi's closed family starts crumbling down when a series of crimes are committed by members of his family. Victor gets beaten up by them. A new police chief arrives, takes Victor under his wing. Maxi's father gets murdered by this police chief because of some old wounds with this family. This is watched by Maxi and Victor.

Maxi's sexual fantasies of Victor never materialized because of Victor's knowledge of right and wrong (as a cop), and Maxi being a minor. One of Maxi's brother gets absolved from a murder because his father pays the price. And finally Maxi goes back to school. There is scene toward the end in where Victor is crying (while he exchanges whistles with Maxi) showing that he really loves this boy (as a friend.)

The final scene shows Victor watching Maxi going to school (there is no exchange between the two.)

This is a good social and cultural movie. The gay issue may be offensive to some because of the age. Some countries are more accepting of sexual issues involving minors than perhaps ours. There was another Dutch movie involving minors, I did not like that one, the age was too young for me. When picking up gay movies, I have been successful and enjoy most of them. When I started watching this one I did not care much but the story grows on you. Again, caution is warranted, or you could be extremely disappointed.",1199491200,10,2606,4.487341772151899
2832387,5,B000Q677HC,"This film from the Phillipines played in Los Angeles at an arthouse to
excellent reviews a year ago, but I first saw it on Netflix.  I have seen
very few gay themed movies, but this one was the best I have seen, far
better than the overrated Brokeback Mountain.  The story follows a 12
year old openly gay boy living in poverty with his father, a cellphone
thief, and his two brothers.  A gungho young new policeman tries to en
force the laws too hard for the small time crooks who normally pay off
the cops to ignore their crimes, but the boy develops a crush on him,
which complicates the situation.  The boy's (and his gay friends) homo-
sexuality is treated casually and non-judgementally for the most part,
and since the mother is dead, the boy performs the woman's role in the
family.  The plot plays out in a realistic, though somewhat tragic way,
and the crush does not lead to pedophelia thankfully, as the cop is
portrayed as a Catholic, though his orientation is somewhat unclear.
The film is very entertaining, and mostly light-hearted, especially in
the scenes with the children having dressing up contests.  But there
are serious undertones, which eventually come to the forefront.  A
terrific film for anyone openminded about sexual orientation and
transgendered issues.  I loved this movie, though the ending surprised
me.",1197072000,3,1338,4.812227074235808

8194572,5,B000Q677HC,"I been watching a few gay movies lately and this has the be one of the best I have watched.
The story line, settings, characters and the message this movie conveys is so profound.

It tells the life of a 12 year old feminine boy growing up in the slumbers of a urban area of Philippines. There, he cares for his father and two older brothers (which are thief) by doing chores that a wife should do but they also care for him as well. The boy seems to be getting along around the streets without getting bullied or raped(which is what mostly happens in third world countries) until one night he finds himself going home late and almost gets raped by two older guys but he is rescued by a grown handsome, honest and very dedicated new officer from town. They formed an unusual bond between a 12 yr old and a 25-27 yr old man(not sexual). Although the boy falls in love with him, the officer maintains his integrity and moral as a grown man. The officer teaches the boy that there is a better way of living in contrast to what his father and brothers do for a living. The end is a little bit sad but adequate for the movie and the characters.

Do not be closed minded about the age of the boy and the officer, which never escalate to a sexual level.

You should definitely watch this movie.

PS; I also fell in love with the officer! lol",1402617600,,1334,4.24015748031496
8194573,5,B000Q677HC,"Quite an extraordinary film really. It must have been shot on the lowest budget ever - $10,000 - hence the not so sophisticated cameras used. But it doesn't matter. The story will carry the viewer through any shortcomings in that respect, even if you notice it, which I didn't. Why would you want to watch a sophisticated well- shot nonsense film anyway?

Apart from that gripe the only low budget aspect of the film is the camera. Those behind the camera knew exactly what they were doing and have proven track records in those areas. The actors too carry the film along and, although unknown to us in Europe, they are very competent and carry a lot of very difficult emotional scenes off flawlessly.

Apart from the topic, which is discussed in detail in another review, this film shows us a side of life with which we are probably totally unfamiliar - poor neglected underclass who never seem to be part of any `booms'. The director (in the Q&A session in the features on the DVD) states that although not his story strictly speaking, the streets are the streets he grew up in and the house of the policeman is his also. It's amazing that people can live in such circumstances but millions have no choice but to get by in any way they can. Maxi's two brothers and his father pull together to get money - illegally - to survive in one of the smallest flats (room?) that I have seen in any film. Don't know how they got the camera crew in there as well. It is all shot on location.

The boy is a brilliant actor and carries the role off very well. Perfectly believable. The death of his mother prematurely, to the shock of the family, causes him to adopt the female role in the household, a role which they encourage because they need someone to look after them. We learn towards the end of the film that he is not by nature such a camp boy at all -hence `the blossoming' of Maximo. He is an intelligent boy but has to leave school to look after the family and he is initially happy with this.

But his situation is set in a much wider context and the lives of all those around him are explored too. The police setup is no small part of the film either, likewise the street gangs and the grinding poverty. In saying this the film is not gloomy. It has a lighter side. It has justice and injustice in equal measure. Maximo is like a flower blooming through the cracks in the pavement.

His relationship with the young policeman is one sided. He is infatuated with him but the policeman tolerates his obsession. There is nothing untoward in the film on this subject. It is all from the boy's perspective.

A very stimulating and enjoyable film and much commended.",1395705600,,2662,4.433537832310838

8194575,5,B000Q677HC,"There are misguided notions about a young boy who is ""coming of age"" when he has lost a parent, especially his Mother before
or just entering puberty.  Because youngsters experiment with sexual preferences does not necessarily mean this becomes a choice for life as an alternative to the male-female lifestyle.  The real value of this Movie, is a good example of how challenged a young boy faces in another culture like the Philippines or another, that is proliferated with theft, drugs, gangs and graft in authorities whether a local magistrate or law enforcement.  Maximo lost his Father at the end of the movie.  His Father was murdered out of revenge by a gang.  Maximo's Brothers send him to school in a boy's uniform, and through the whole course of the movie, a young police officer refuses the boy's sexual advances.  The boy and the police officer go their own separate way in life. The poverty and neighborhood setting would be formidable for any 12 year old boy to grow up in.  After viewing this movie, in the USA, although I grew up on the edge of a welfare neighborhood in a lower middle class family, it was my good fortune to have a neighborhood, school, church and a loving family.  My youth was in a neighborhood and town which was a real community of people watching out for the well being of one another.  In the military, I have been in some foreign countries and this DVD reminded me of similar poverty and deprivations I witnessed. Have anyone view this movie and they will appreciate our way of life
in the USA more.",1390176000,,1540,4.611721611721611

There are a million Maximos in this world.

what we only see.",1385683200,,228,4.871794871794871
