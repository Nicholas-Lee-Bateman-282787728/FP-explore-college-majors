8326095,5,B0014DV9SO,"At the beginning of June 2007, Hosny released his third movie Omar & Salma with Mai Ezzedine. Omar (Tamer Hosny) is a young man who likes to flirt with all kinds of girls and has never been a serious relationship. That all changes when he meets Salma (Mai Ezz El Din) who totally changes the way he thinks, but their new relationship turns out to be a bumpy ride.

One of my favorite movies and I love the soundtrack as well. The movie is both romantic and very funny!
