2659099,5,B000IMV3XS,A great story about some wonderful nurses.  I wish it was longer because they did a terrific job !!,1178496000,16,99,4.2105263157894735
2659100,5,B000IMV3XS,"I saw this dvd at a nursing convention and picked up one for myself and a friend of mine who has an interest in nursing during the Vietnam war.  This dvd offers a thought provoking look into what the lives of nurses who served in Vietnam were really like.  It is a story that the public did not hear about very much or wanted to acknowledge and is brought to life by real nurses who experienced it.  As a nurse myself, I saw in these women all the attributes that a nurse should exhibit such as compassion, dedication, the healing power of touch and a kind word, and empathy.  Like many of the soldiers that served, these nurses were in their late teens to early 20s when they went to serve and were not prepared for what they were going to experience in war. These experiences definitely impacted their lives and is something they can never forget and still haunts them today.  Their story needed to be told and the recognition of these real life heroes is long overdue.  Without these nurses, more lives would have been lost.  I also found it fitting that they had Dana Delay narrating the documentary since she had portrayed a Vietnam era nurse in the TV Series ""China Beach.""",1174694400,101,1179,4.455813953488372
2659101,5,B000IMV3XS,"Very well done!!  Worth every penny and provides insights not only into the nurses who served, but also anyone who served in that confusing time and place.  The saying that ""there are no unwounded soldiers in a war"" is very much a reality.",1173830400,48,239,4.534883720930233
2659112,5,B000IMV3XS,DVD that all American nurses should watch. The caring and stamina these women had was amazing and they made a positive impact on the lives of many young soldiers.,1407024000,,162,4.620689655172414
2659113,5,B000IMV3XS,"i also enjoyed this,  it was close to home for me.",1406678400,,50,3.5454545454545454
2659114,5,B000IMV3XS,Get the tissues out for this one. Wonderfully narrated story of the lives of nurses in Vietnam. Shows some actual footage and some interviews later/now of the nurses talking about their experiences.,1404777600,,198,5.21875
2659115,3,B000IMV3XS,"I saw the China Beach special episode with actual Vietnam nurses that was aired when China Beach was broadcast back in 1989.  It was entitled ""vets"" and had vets' recollections intertwined with show episodes..  That was an even more powerful special than Dana Delaney with the Vietnam Nurses.  I hope John Wells and John Secret Young consider releasing that as a separate video.  I am sure the same nurses are in that episode.",1404518400,,426,4.794520547945205
2659116,4,B000IMV3XS,Anyone interested in the Vietnam War should watch this before making any assumptions.  It is a terrific insight into what our nurses had to endure during the war; something that most people seem to overlook.  Very powerful and touching.  I highly recommend it.,1396396800,,260,5.0
2659117,5,B000IMV3XS,"My favorite show has been China Beach. It came out recently on dvd and I received it as a gift. I was so happy and surprised . I watched every episode till they were no more.  I will re- watch it again. VIETNAM NURSES is about the women who were portrayed through out China Beach as their nurses.  So many nurses were there caring for our boys in viet nam and did such a man filled job as far as Doctoring and trying so hard to keep them a live,with their  bravery and gutting up. I was never more proud as a woman then I was watching China Beach. Then I saw Dana Delany ,was hosting this documentry and I knew I wanted to own it and watch it.  Dana Delany won a Emmey for this show You will not be disappointed. Like China Beach (and Platoon which I saw at the show when it first came out,there will be tears, a lot of tears. Worth buying.",1378425600,5,840,4.0119760479041915
2659118,5,B000IMV3XS,"This was one of the saddest and most thought provoking documentaries I have ever seen.  It  gives the viewer an accurate and broader perspective on the profound effects of war,how it affected the nurses who cared for our brave soldiers, and Marines;the exhausting efforts of all involved,the selflessness, the horror they witnessed,the sadness, helplessness , guilt over those they could not save,interwined with joy when they could save a young man's life. It also hints at how all of this can lead to depression and Post traumatic stress disorder; how the nurses eventually went on survival mode or auto pilot just as the soldiers do, to do the task,and then later either cried until they could no longer cry or supressed their feelings in a variety of ways. Those young women, just as our brave men are changed by war forever. That they had to work so hard just to get the memorial built  was sad, yet inspiring. They truly were angels .God bless all who served and continue to serve in the military.",1378252800,3,1003,4.752873563218391
2659119,3,B000IMV3XS,"Most all of this documentary is about how poorly prepared these young women were for what they were about to experience and how difficult their time in country was.  They speak to the anguish of having a young man die under their care and while I acknowledge their pain, it all became a bit boring after only a few minutes.  Very little mention was made of the men in the field who experienced the very same things as the nurses but while at the same time were being shot at, fought in the rain and mud and heat and dust, slept on the ground, and had C-rations for days on end.  I realize this was about the nurses, but they were not the ones who had it the most difficult and it would have helped had they acknowledged that.  When the nurses started talking about the parties they had and the music they played, I turned it off.  I had all I could take.  I was one of those guys fighting the war who did not sleep in a clean bed each night, who did not get a shower each day, who did not go to the messhall for meals, and who did not go to frequent parties.  You had it tough ladies, but let's keep it all in perspective.",1377216000,3,1122,4.072727272727272
2659120,4,B000IMV3XS,"This was not what I expected ( I don't really know what I was), but with that said it was still very good. so hard to imagine what these nurses went through and still did it with grace. My total respect goes out to all who served in such a  place as this. The good they did out numbered the bad by far. God Bless Them All!",1373846400,3,322,3.8059701492537314
2659121,4,B000IMV3XS,Seeing and listening to first hand accounts of these women sparked my interest in reading more so found two first hand accounts of what they went through.,1365379200,4,154,4.7407407407407405
2659122,5,B000IMV3XS,This film was done well and it is good to have documentation of what part our nurses played in Vietnam. Would love to see China Beach in DVD,1358294400,,140,4.035714285714286
2659123,5,B000IMV3XS,"""vietnam Nurses"" is a heartfelt, albeit often painful, documentary about a group of women who served their country in the midst of the horrors of war; and who, for far-too-long remained invisible within, and unacknowledged by most of, America.

It is a series of stories of lost innocence; courage; pain; lonliness and [finally]redemption- A story to remind us that all (men AND women)who go to war on our behalf pay ""a price"" they could never have imagined.

Every person in America should see this film.",1336694400,3,505,4.929411764705883
2659124,5,B000IMV3XS,"This is a poignant and powerful film that resonates with truth that needed to be told. War forever changes all those who took part and these very brave young women, raised with the myths of the 1950's early 60's US culture were stepping into a crucible of revolutionary cultural change and chaotic violence. How they dealt with these pressures along with numerous 24 hour non stop shifts of unending carnage is a tribute to their courage and resilience. The most moving part of this film, which is short 45 min-but not one minute is wasted, was when  Diane Carlson Evans, the Vietnam Nurse who spearheaded the drive to have a monument in Washington DC honoring the nurses who served in Vietnam, recalled how she had been raised in hte Lutheran faith, and a while after she returned from Vietnam, someone from the Lutheran Church contacted her and wanted to interview her, and she said"" I'm not the person you want. I prayed every day I was in Vietnam for the war to stop and the killing and maiming to stop and it did not. So God is dead.
  The interviewer remarked that maybe God was in Vietnam through the empathy and love and care shown by nurses like herself during the insanity of war. Brought me to tears and I'm not religious.",1292284800,11,1233,4.545045045045045
2659125,5,B000IMV3XS,"I am a professor of gerontology currently teaching a course on the impact of combat on aging Vietnam veterans.  In addition to explaining the role of nurses in Vietnam, the interviews in this documentary shed light on the psychological trauma the nurses experience. The symptoms of combat induced PTSD as well as the resilience that many nurses experience are also documented. The film should be of interest to scholars studying trauma.",1260835200,9,436,5.140845070422535
2659126,5,B000IMV3XS,"This was quite a remarkable set of true stories that involved women who you could hear see and feel what they had been through, the recognition that all these men and women deserved should have been given long ago. This was a great documentary movie, things like this should never be forgotten.",1258416000,9,294,4.673076923076923
2659127,5,B000IMV3XS,"""Vietnam Nurses"" is a well shot and well edited video that is a must see for nurses. This video was the idea of nurses...not producers and kudos go to their vision! Little attention has been paid to the sacrifices of nurses and other medical professionals during wartime and this video highlights their service, intelligence, bravery, caring, and the long-term impact of that service.",1230336000,17,384,5.111111111111111
2659128,5,B000IMV3XS,"Thank you for this film. It's been a long road home from Da Nang and the smells, sights, sounds, and tears of the most terrible and most influential time in my life. None of us who served as Nam Nurses ever realized that our one year in SE Asia would in some ways consume and remain with us for the rest of our lives. I cannot, and will not, say I am at Peace with my ""Tour""; but I have come to accept that as long as I can recall the funny/idiotic moments (and there were lots of them) more often than the gut-draining sorrow and exhaustion moments I will sleep better. From someone who was there, this film is worth watching and worth owning. didi-mau time. Over and out.",1219708800,35,673,4.184615384615385
2659129,5,B000IMV3XS,"As a surviving combat Marine Grunt of the Viet Nam war, I want to laud this movie, that shows the very real part American nurses in Viet Nam played to support, not the war, but the soldiers and Marines who were wounded and med-evaced to an aid station, a surgical unit, or hospital ship. This was officially the first time American women served in a combat area where they could also be wounded or killed. They served, they treated and they provided for the wounded and the dying - not an easy challenge for the most hardened combat vet. Women in combat, especially these very brave women in Viet Nam, deserve all the credit they receive and more. There are many veterans today who give credit to their survival, not to the doctors, but to the American nurses who took care of them.

Semper Fi, nurses. You deserve much more than you received from that war.",1200700800,68,857,4.493589743589744
2659130,5,B000IMV3XS,"As a Vietnam era nurse and massage therapist who has worked for years helping people recover from trauma, I found that watching and listening to the Vietnam nurses relate their experiences was a life altering experience.  By it's very nature, traumatic material is chaotic.  I really appreciated that the organization and presentation of material brought some sense of order so that a viewer can take it in without being needlessly overwhelmed. Harsh scenes are interspersed with breaks and summaries by Dana Delaney, without mitigating the nurses' feeling during narrations. As a viewer, I felt both emotionally moved, and moved to action to contribute, as they did, to healing the impact of war.  I wish that Dr. Margaret Carson had made an appearance, too, as it seems that the film was based on her research.",1195516800,22,812,5.044776119402985
2659131,5,B000IMV3XS,"My history professor used this dvd in the classroom on  the Vietnam War. It stands out for me as one of the best illustrations of what women in war are all about. The interviews with the real participants and the inserts of the TV show"" China Beach"" are priceless! A great reminder that history is about real people not just a date or a battle. These nurses/ women are my heroes.",1181952000,19,379,4.338028169014085

8146317,5,B000IMV3XS,"DVD arrived quickly and enjoyed it a lot.  Personally, I was very moved the way Viet Nam nurses were portrayed and especially moved when Dana Delany spoke of how she was effected by her character; playing as a nurse at a MASH unit at China Beach.  I was high school age at the height of the war and saw a lot of my friends go away only to never return.  Grew up to marry a man who had been there and lived to tell about it, telling me about being spit on in airports, eventually being told to not wear his uniform off base.  Such a sad and shameful time in our country.

This DVD is well worth the price and more than worth your time watching it.",1414454400,,646,4.015625
