8067995,2,B0009W8PII,"This movie is also known as ""The Hills Have Eyes Part 3"" and ""The Outpost."" But neither of those titles are
used on the DVD/VHS versions of the film.

Anyways it's about a group of scientist finding a man all bloody and bruised from committing suicide,by jumping off a cliff in the desert outside there lab. They give him a rejuvenation serum that they been working on""to make super soldiers for the military"" so they could save his life. They only tested it on animals so they didn't know how it effected humans. They thought he died but he came to live as soon as they were about to give up on him. As soon as they went to his body, he goes crazy and kills one scientist. He starts a little killing spree and turns more hulk like and hides in the vents. They call ""Lance Henriksen"" to come down to stop this killer ""since Lance is the one who created the serum."" So he comes down with his son,daughter and her boyfriend. Then the film kinda gets boring from there since everyone is just running around or talking.
I can't tell much else without giving away the movie.

There's a pretty low body count and there's really no suspense. The acting is ok but you don't really care for none of the characters. I'll say you can skip on this for sure, the killer mutant doesn't even safe this movie.",1382832000,6,1293,4.338842975206612
