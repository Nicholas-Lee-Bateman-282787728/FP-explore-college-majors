2521637,3,B000EJ1NVM,"The GOOD part -
Chanakya is a great epic story from hisory. It is based on historical books and references. Excellent efforts have been taken in the making of this TV show, originally made for - Door Darshan (one of the larget TV network in the whole world) in 1990s. Most of the movie making aspects are superbly crafted together and if you can understand the complex plots, you will be glued to the screen till you finish all 47 episodes (each approx. 37 min.) So there is no doubt about the content, it is really G R E A T !!!
DVD covers - Slim packaging used. Saves a lot of space on your shelf. Each Disc cover has episode summary. Easy to track.

Now the BAD part -
Whenever there are Video CDs released first and followed by DVD release, I am always suspicious about 'real' DVD transfer. This happens quite often for Indian DVDs. Chanakya DVDs appear to be a vicitm of this bad practice.
Here is how -
1. I have watched the VCDs of Chanakya before it appeared on DVDs. It seems, the content is just - adopted to DVDs. Not really transferred from the original source.
2. I have also watched these on real TV in 1990s. I can not forget the Audio Visual quality of the episods on live TV.So the original shows were better in quality for sure and should have been properly used to transfer content to today's digital media - not done.
3. What you get in DVD is far from the real content. The 4:3 aspect Video not only lacks the basic quality, it is worst and noticeably noisy/dark and in some episodes unbearable.
4. Same goes with Audio. It is not loud enough. Forget about Stereo channels. It is encoded in typcal Dolby (AC 3) but transferred from poor Mono track of the VCD. You really need to adjust setting a lot on your TV or Receiver before you can make it reach to your ears properly.
5. On the DVD covers they have shamelessly printed - DTS (is it even legal ??) and none of the DVD titles are DTS encoded.
6. Another blunder - DVD covers carry - DVD 9 logos. But actual DVDs are regular - DVD 5. So proves the 4 Hrs of video on each disc can not be encoded in good quality. (Good quality DVDs have max. 2 Hrs. of Video. Quality get worst as you keep adding more length of videos to it - A big flaw in DVD standards)

So the technical Quality overall is very very disappointing. It really makes a great TV show un enjoyable  .....

Conclusion -
If you find a good deal, buy the DVDs for the story and forget that you are watching it on DVD. Imagine it is a YouTube video on a DVD disc. in short - a big rip off/cheating as far as the DVD production/transfer is concerned.
I give three stars - for Content NOT for DVD making/Media at all.",1225497600,22,2649,4.198428290766208
2521638,5,B000EJ1NVM,"The amount of research done to create this Epic is astounding and the screenplay is most admirable. Dr. Dwivedi brings the ancient period alive on the screen with impeccable dialogues, in pure Hindi/Samskrith.
All of the shown circumstances, issues, national interests & political turmoils seems to have become evergreen in this human world. Every patriotic person has something to take away from this Kautilya's life history and Ancient India period.

I rate this above other epics & classics like Bharath Ek Khoj, Mahabharath or Vishwamitra.

2521639,5,B000EJ1NVM,"brilliant direction, outstanding acting and superb dialogues make this an unforgettable series. I first saw this as a child many years ago and could not understand a word of it. But a good 15 years later Chanakya stands out as once of the master pieces of indian television. Seldom has Indian history received the attention it deserves mainly due to the lack of many historical records but Chanakya will stand to have single handedly corrected that in a rich style and narrative. This series in DVD brings out the life of Indias greatest politician-saint in a compellingly real life form. The series is devoid of any jingoism and shows the pain and anguish of a true patriot seeing his motherland being destroyed by foreign invaders. A true must see for anyone interested in Indian history.",1202601600,2,790,4.859259259259259
2521640,5,B000EJ1NVM,"a brilliant production with great accuracy to history as far as possible. it has been one of the pioneering historical serials in the lines of benegal's bharat ek khoj-perhaps better. Discovery of India has a theme and foundation from nehru's book. Chankya's figure is so old that it almost has mythological aspect to it. but Dwivedi has presented in a fashion and accuracy that makes it authentic as well contemporary. beautiful dialogues in purest hindi, a compact and sterling acting by the cast, authentic settings and greatest accuracy to details- chankya stands monumentally tall as compared to cheaper though more popular serials of ramayana and mahabharta.",1175385600,15,664,5.273584905660377

8110538,5,B000EJ1NVM,"This series aired on Indian television during 1991-1992. It is the story of the historic Chanakya (Vishnugupta), the economist, strategist, scholar of the Vedas, renowned teacher, and devoted patriot of his motherland India. The series depicts the events that spanned from 340 B.C. to 320 B.C. It starts with Chanakya's boyhood in Magadha, and continues on to the circumstances that led to his voluntary exile, attack of India by Alexander, and overthrowing of the Nanda rule in Maghada and crowning of Chandragupta. An incredible amount of research has gone into the making of this phenomenal program. The events are an indispensable part ancient Indian history. Indian television has aired many scholarly series, and this is one of them.",1353542400,2,739,5.271186440677966
8110539,2,B000EJ1NVM,"Chanakya is a great series, extremely educational and entertaining - worth watching it. Unfortunately, several chapters in the 8 DVDs that I received do not have any sound. Without those chapters, it is difficult to follow the story and the whole series seems worthless. Moreover, DVD menu (chapter selection) does not work. Overall great series but horrible DVD quality.
