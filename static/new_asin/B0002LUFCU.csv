Every time I try to describe what these guys do, I spend at least a half an hour and still feel like I haven't scratched the surface.  This DVD is probibly the best introduction to the COG that they have released (their albums are awesome too).  They are film makers(the special effects, blue screen work and sets are outragious), musicians, actors,  inventors(for real) and put on the most amazing multimedia show around(and it ROCKS too) Drumbot alone is worth the price of admission.  If you can't make a live show, this is the closest you will get.  If you can make a show, get this first and you will come back for more and more.  The COG is the most original act I have seen in years.  They are like a live action warner bros. cartoon, but with more volume.  You won't regret buying this and you will soon be singing their praises as well.  Bow to the COG!!!!",1090713600,,1016,4.345744680851064
8185094,5,B0002LUFCU,I am of sound mind and body and have chosen to write this of my own free will. I liked it. It was much better than Cats. I will see it again and again. COG has given me the will to overcome many trials of hardship and this DVD is a testament to their unrelenting drive and determination. My only wish is to someday become useful in a world ruled by Dr Milo T Pinkerton III.,1090713600,,373,3.9210526315789473
