1707270,5,B000065R11,"This film is the most visible evidence you can express the artistic beauty of a movie without big budgets and even dealing with such rough script like this one.

Two twins, as part of the final request of their mother's will, will have to undertake an untamed search through the aridness of the desert, the ancestral hates and existential desolation, in order to find their brother with the only task of making him to know his true origin.

Dennis Villeneuve (43) has demonstrated he is one of the major driving forces of the great cinema, and if it's true the film didn't take the golden statue, it will remain among the most lucid, powerful and ambitius films of this century that just begins.

A heartbreaking movie from start to finish. Don't even miss it!!!",1305504000,3,762,4.6716417910447765
1707271,5,B000065R11,"I used to believe storytelling using film was an art long forgotten. This film is just the best movie, I have seen in many a year. When Aristotle considers the tragic hero and resolution of the plot (catharsis) through fate no other movie fits the classic Greek tragedy as this Academy nomination (shame the movie did not win in 2011). The film has a middle eastern war setting and will bring a grown adult to a tear or two as we follow the protagonist in her tragedies. Long after you have left the cinema will the haunting images continue to run inside your head creating an unforgettable experience. Is this what Aristotle had in mind when he spoke and wrote of the tragedy ?  The story and film direction defies putting into words and one can only urge viewers to review the movie frame by frame after an initial viewing.  Without delving into the storyline or director pedigree, this film lives up to creating a rewarding and amazing film viewing experience for any who cares watch.",1303603200,3,987,4.6022727272727275
1707272,5,B000065R11,"""Incendies"" (the title translates as ""Scorched"", but, much as with ""Les Miserables"", the original meaning is conveyed to Anglophones quite adequately by the French word) was the most successful Canadien film of 2010, earning eight Genie Awards (including awards for Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Screenplay), and being nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.  It was a contender for the Oscar, ultimately losing to Denmark's ""In A Better World"".  But regardless, it is a superb piece of cinema, easily the strongest effort from rising writer-director Denis Villeneuve.  Though starting off and ending in Canada, the meat of the action occurs in perpetually war-torn Lebanon.  Spoilers follow.

The film begins in Montreal in 2009, where Lebanese-Canadian twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Mlissa Dsormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette) have just lost their mother, Nawal (Lubna Azabal, superb).  Nawal's employer and friend, notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard, a regular in the films of Denys Arcand, including ""The Barbarian Invasions"", which won the Oscar in 2003), provides them with her will.  Nawal supplies a major revelation for her children:  their father and a heretofor-unmentioned sibling are both alive and somewhere in Lebanon.  Nawal provides two letters, one for each, and asks that they locate and deliver them.  Simon is dismissive, but Jeanne forges ahead, plunging into the complicated history (familial and national) of her mother's homeland.  The twins' story is intercut with the history of Nawal in the 1970s and 1980s, as Lebanon descends into civil war and, ultimately, foreign invasion.

The performances of the main cast are uniformly strong, particularly Azabal, who won the Genie for her work here.  Girard (who rather resembles a Quebecois Tom Wilkinson), the veteran of the cast, does a nice job in a supporting role.  Dsormeaux-Poulin and Gaudette as the children do a commendable job with the present-day segments; their roles are less active than Azabal's, but their reaction shots are terrific.  Villeneuve's writing and direction are both excellent.  Even some of my initial reservations about the movie, such as what initially is a rather heavy-handed analogy between life and pure mathematics, were later significantly dispelled (the mathematics motif, for instance, has an excellent final usage).  Villeneuve artfully structures the action.  Sophocles would have admired the finale.  And, for a Canadian film that trots the globe, at no point does the budget appear to be too modest for the film's ambitions.

Highly recommended.",1299888000,7,2581,5.4534005037783375

1707353,5,B000065R11,"Incendies (""Scorched"") is a dark, powerful and haunting thriller-drama from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. I will leave the plot line out for the benefit of the audience. The film is in French/Arabic, so English viewers will have to go by the sub-titles.

The film shares it's secrets in layers - when you've watched one layer and think you've seen it all, you're presented with another that is far more complex and visceral than the previous one and so on and so forth until the film explodes in a shattering climax that will leave you reeling. I remember being stunned as the credits rolled and being speechless for minutes. I decided to own the DVD because I haven't watched such a great thriller in years.

The direction and cinematography is a work of art. The acting is excellent and Lubna Azabal is phenomenal.

But I think it was just shock value. For me, the theme was gross, the plot contrived and illogical. I'm willing to follow movie portrayals of some pretty questionable characters. However, there was little redeeming value in the plot and characters. Like other reviewers, it left me wondering about the logic and motivation of the main character, Narwal. Why would she possibly reveal these things?

The movie uses flashbacks extensively and clearly. However, the jumping back and forth and the coolness of the characters left me not really caring about any of them. I felt just like Narwal looked at the pool (empty) and the way her son appeared (detached). It's unfortunate because the acting was exceptional.

The setting is an unidentified country in the Middle East (probably Lebanon, as the playwright's family is Lebanese) but the story could be a metaphor for any of the conflicts going on in the Middle East.

The entire cast is excellent, in particular Lubna Azabal as the lead actress was fantastic. I also loved the Radiohead soundtrack - perfectly moody and atmospheric to match the film.

separately and ultimately decide their lives would be better if the supervisors from hell were dead. The
cast saves this film with appearances from Donald Sutherland and Jamie Foxx as well.
But don't pick apart the premise--youll only criticize it for being recycled (regurgitated) from classics as
Strangers on a Train (1951) and its spawned Throw Momma from the Train (1987). Avoid any in-depth
study of character, storyline, plot, reason in Horrible Bosses. Okay maybe what Im saying is if you're in it
for the laughs, Horrible Bosses delivers (hint: you might want to catch this one in theaters to get that mob
mentality when it comes to getting those laughs).This film is more a reflection of todays troubled job

Ultimately, it was a object lesson in letting go. Some other reviewers have critiqued the movie, saying it was too neat, the piece fit together too well. I was caught up in it, wholly, so I didn't notice or much care that some of the notes may have rung melodramatically or the likelihood of events was low.

1707440,5,B000065R11,"INCENDIES began as a play of the same name by Wajdi Mouawad and was opened up as only cinema can do by the author with the assistance of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and consultant Val&eacute;rie Beaugrand-Champagne. The result is a staggeringly powerful film whose story is so well revealed by a cast of sterling actors that telling too much of the plot would be a disservice to those who come to this experience for the first time. In this viewer's opinion it is simply one of the finest films of the decade and it bound to become a permanent part of the cinematic library.

The opening of the film reveals many clues as to the direction the story will take. In a stark room young boys are having their hair shorn: one of the boys as a tattoo on his heal - three aligned dots on the Achilles tendon. After this unsettling beginning the camera moves to Canada in the office of notary Jean Lebel (R&eacute;my Girard) who has the responsibility of executing the will of his secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal in an illuminating performance that plays through the entire film) and presenting the will to Nawal's Lebanese- Canadian twin children Jeanne (M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) Marwan. The will divides Nawal's worldly goods equally between the children, but describes in detail how the deceased mother is to be buried (naked, face down, with no coffin in an unmarked grave) and provides two letters charging Jeanne and Simon to find the father and brother they did not even know existed. The remainder of the film moves back and forth between the past and the present as the twins attempt to find their living relatives and the story of how Nawal's life was an unbelievable nightmare. Nawal was a Christian Lebanese, had a lover who was a Palestinian, and when her lover is killed she realizes she is pregnant, shaming her family and thus forced to give up her boy child to an orphanage - but not before her grandmother sensitively tattooed the three dots on his heel for future recognition. From that point Nawal becomes a mathematician, a hired killer, is imprisoned and tortured and once again becomes a mother. The twins trace clues as detectives to follow the rocky road of Nawal's life and make discoveries that are astonishing.

Though Lubna Azabal is clearly the central star of this film, the entire cast particularly M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as the twins is exemplary. Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins. This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful. The cinematography by Andr&eacute; Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy. The musical score by Gr&eacute;goire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtly. But in the end it is the sensitive direction of Denis Villeneuve that brings with human tragedy of a story alive. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 13",1366588800,2,3198,4.876838235294118
1707441,4,B000065R11,"It's good to find a book or movie that surprises you with its twists and turns...where you haven't figured out the ending by the middle of the movie...and this movie qualifies as one of those movies.

The topic is ""dark"" with a culture and life style that is so foreign to me.  That being said, the movie fascinated me.  I first watched it on TV and then bought it to share with a specific friend of mine.  The topic is very harsh and sad.

I am not going to tell the story in this review because it would ruin the story and ending for you.  Rather, if you want to watch a good movie deal with a tremendously harsh and cruel topic and have unsuspected twists and turns throughout the movie and somehow still have a surprise ending...I believe you'll enjoy this movie.

From that point Nawal becomes a mathematician, a hired killer, is imprisoned and tortured and once again becomes a mother. The twins trace clues as detectives to follow the rocky road of Nawal's life and make discoveries that are astonishing.

Though Lubna Azabal is clearly the central star of this film, the entire cast particularly M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as the twins is exemplary. Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins. This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful. The cinematography by Andr&eacute; Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy. The musical score by Gr&eacute;goire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtlely.

1707471,4,B000065R11,"Our Canadian neighbors produced this emotionally devastating film which gathered an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film.  In present day Montreal, twins Simon Marwan (Maxime Gaudette) and his sister Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) are presented with the will of their late mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal).  The siblings are surprised as their mother left information that their father and a brother they never knew about, were still alive.  She asks that they search them out and give each an envelope she had previously prepared.

Their search leads them back to Nawal's origins in 1970 Lebanon.  A series of flashbacks begins as an 18 or 19 Nawal has besmirched the family honor by becoming pregnant out of marriage.  The young father is killed but Nawal is saved by her grandmother.  Nawal and her infant son are quickly separated.  The baby is sent to an orphanage and Nawal is sent to the city to live with her uncle and go to school.

As Nawal's now grown daughter, Jeanne begins to trace her mother's plight which is complicated by the religious civil war that engulfed Lebanon in the early to mid-1970's.  There are tragic events that are uncovered which leads to a life altering conclusion.  I will admit to being surprised.  Others may see it coming.  The film does run very long at 2 hours and 10 minutes.  I kept wishing they would just get on with it.  The performance by Azabal as Nawal is certainly noteworthy and the twists and turns of the uncovering mystery make this film high on my recommended list.

The Sony Blu ray disc is extremely good.  Presented in 1080p, the film has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Much of the film is shot is with a sandy landscape representing rural Lebanon.  Interior scenes range from colorful to bland but the Blu ray gives an honest representation.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is likewise spectacular.  While much of the film is dialog centered, there is plenty of external action to keep the speakers occupied.  There are many crowd scenes as well a cramped but noisy rooms.  There are also several war events as well.  Listen to the 2 jets scream across the sky.  You'll swear they're just overhead.",1335916800,,2157,4.796195652173913
1707472,5,B000065R11,"Let me state upfront that I had heard about this movie (it was nominated for last year's Oscar for Best Foreign Movie) but it never came to play in the theatre here in Cincinnati, so I recently picked it up from the foreign movie section at my local library. While I was very generally aware of what this movie is about, I was not prepared for what I actually saw.

""Incendies"" (2010 from French-Canada; 131 min.; the title translates roughly as ""Fire"") brings the story of Nawal Marwan, a Christian woman in an unnamed Middle Eastern country (but from all the details we get, likely Lebanon), who, having spent the last part of her life in Canada, upon her death (through her last will) is asking her twin children (boy and girl) to find their brother (whom they never knew they had) and their father (who they had assumed had died in the war). The movie brings two parallel stories: how Nawal went through the years, after 'shaming' her family for giving birth at an early age, the father not being Christian, and the child being taken away from her, and later looking to find her son, and how the twins after their mother's death go on a search in the Middle East for their mother's origins and for their brother and their father. I don't want to give much further away from the plot as it would simply ruin the viewing experience.

Let is be said that I haven't seen such a powerful movie in quite a while, and I see a lot of movies. I also saw the movie that did win the Oscar last year for Best Foreign Movie, Denmark's ""For a Better World"", which is not bad either, but let me tell you, this is MILES better and it's a shame this movie didn't win the Oscar. But beware: there are a number of shocking scenes that are not for the faint of heart. All that aside, PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE, you will be in for a rare treat.

1707475,4,B000065R11,"The story is about an Arab woman who as a young girl escapes from a Muslim country with her two twin children and raises them in Canada without any knowledge of their mother's horrific past. The movie opens on the mother's death and the reading of a will that asks her adult-age twin daughter and son to deliver sealed letters to a father and brother that they never knew existed. The brother is hostile to his mother's wishes so the daughter sets out alone for an unfamiliar and sometimes hostile Middle East country to discover her mother's history and in the process try to find the missing father and a brother she never knew existed.

Two stories are told simultaneously. One is the mother's past and the tragic consequences of being caught in two nightmares: one is being a young girl living under a strict rural Muslim moral code where a daughter can be killed for having any contact with men not arranged for and condoned by the family and the other is as a Christian living in a predominately Muslim country caught up in a civil war between Muslims and Christians. The other simultaneous story is the daughter's story about the consequences of returning to her mother's homeland and trying to discover the details of her mother's life. Her only clues are her mother's name and a picture of her mother as a young girl.

At times, I found the movie somewhat confusing as it jumps between the two simultaneous stories without warning and it takes a few seconds to tell whose story the movie is telling, the mother's or the daughter's.  However, this is not a major distraction.

The story is compelling and will hold your interest. The images are captivating. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 primarily because of the horrific violence between Christian and Muslim Arabs and its overall dark theme. I personally prefer uplifting movies. It is a foreign movie with subtitles and was nominated for the 2010 Best Foreign Language Oscar (This alone is a reason to watch it).

The story goes back and forth between the present day search for these people, and the mother's past. As the twins find out things they never even suspected about their mother, their own complicated relationship with her begins to make sense.

The ending has been criticized as contrived and condescending by some, but I felt it was perfect in that it went into emotional territory that is often overlooked in movies, such as what makes a person become ""evil"".

I thought the acting was excellent, and the use of settings was superb. I travelled in the mid east many years ago and watching the bus wind its way along the narrow and twisty roads recalled the feelings I had of being alone, despite having many around me, and this was what I think the director was trying to put forth in those scenes - the aloneness and vulnerability of the character.

This is more than a movie about religious intolerance, the horrendous cost of war and the oppression of women in some societies: it's also about two people (twins Jeanne & Simon) learning about love & loss as they discover the truth about their mother. Nawaal's story is told parallel to Jeanne & Simon's and the emotional tension is at times excruciating as the audience discovers Nawaal's dark secrets slightly ahead of the twins.

To Jeanne and Simon, naturally shocked, a notary Lebel (Rmy Girard) reads a strange will of their deceased mother. They are to deliver two envelopes, one to their father and the other to their brother (hitherto unknown to them). After doing that, they are allowed to read a letter from the mother.

Simon refuses, but Jeanne, unable to ignore their mother's last wish, travels to Middle East. The only clue she has is a small black-and-white photo of her mother. And there she learns the truths about their mother's turbulent life at the time of a civil war.

Helmed by Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (""Maelstrm""), the skillfully told story of the Canadian/French film goes back and forth in time, following the two journeys of Nawal and Jeanne in a fictional Middle Eastern country.

The director's intention to avoid making the film political is obvious. Bolstered by the strong performances of the cast (Lubna Azabal is amazing), ""Incendies"" (nominated for Best Foreign Language Film) is notable for its dramatic impact. Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's stage play, the film may reminds you of some classic plays with its convoluted storyline, but it never feels ""stagy"" with the landscapes of Jordan (where the film was partly shot) that are effectively used.

1707484,4,B000065R11,"`Incendies' translates into English as `scorched' and is a good metaphor for the whole film. This is the story of Narwal Marwan (Lubna Azabal), who has left an unusual last will and testament. Said will is then read to her twin children by her former employer and attorney. In it they are both given a letter each to deliver, the daughter Jeanne, has one for the father and her brother Simon, has one for their brother. The problem is that up until this point they believed their father to be dead and this is the first they had heard of a brother.

Jeanne is more enthused than her sibling and sets off with minimal information to find her Pops. Simon is disgruntled with the whole thing and stays at home sulking - that is probably the Gallic influence. Jeanne goes to an unnamed country that is more than likely the Lebanon, where she starts her search for the past. The real past is told in episodic flashbacks, and we start to see what a harrowing and extraordinary life that Narwal has lived. We are taken on a tour of Daresh and Deressa during the civil war. We see religious intolerance, war atrocities and honour killings. Whilst this is all done very tastefully, it has the feel of being much more gritty than it actually is and that has to be a testament to the brilliant direction of Denis Villeneuve (who also adapted this from the stage play).

This is also beautifully shot and has a powerful soundtrack that features Radiohead. Whilst not a short film with a run time of 130 minutes, this did not feel like a chore at all, in fact it seemed to fly by. There are some that will not be satisfied with the ending, but c'est la vie.

From the Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (""Malestrom"", ""Polytechnique"") comes the Academy Award nominated ""Best Foreign Language"" film titled ""Incendies"".  A film adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play ""Scorched"" which has won multiple awards including eight 31st Genie Awards including ""Best Motion Picture"", ""Best Actress"", ""Best Director"" and ""Best Adapted Screenplay"".

VIDEO:

""Incendies"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and the picture quality is fantastic.  From the detail on the close-up of the faces of the characters, the vibrant colors as both women travel throughout the Middle East, the detail on the baby receiving its mark on its foot, the grime and bruised feet and legs of Nawal in prison.  There is a lot of detail in this film.  Black levels are inky and deep and a good balance between warm and cool colors throughout the film.  I detected no banding, no edge enhancement, no artifacts... if anything, ""Incendies"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray and fans/viewers of the film should be thrilled by the overall picture quality!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Incendies"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  While the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film, the film utilizes the ambiance of a war-torn era, people running around, escaping danger.  Military vehicles driving by, people firing their machine guns, fire burning vehicles and buildings, the howls and cries of the women in the prison as they are being tortured.  If anything, dialogue is crystal clear coming from the center and front channels and the ambiance was well-done as it comes through the surround channels.

Overall, the lossless audio quality is quite appropriate for the film.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Incendies"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary with Director Denis Villeneuve - In-depth audio commentary by Director Denis Villeneuve.
  Remembering the Ashes: Incendies Through Their Eyes  - (44:08) Behind-the-scenes of the making of ""Incendies"".

EXTRAS:
""Incendies: Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Incendies"" is one of those films that stays in your head for quite awhile.  Powerful, moving, shocking... I have to admit that it gave me that ""WOW!"" feeling that a film such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gave be back in 1994, unpredictable climax and a shocking ending to make you feel that you just watched one hell of a masterpiece!

Make no doubt about it, this is probably one of the most disturbing family tragedy that one will watch but once the ending credits show up, you just realize how powerful and cathartic ""Incendies"" truly is.

The film which was an adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play is wonderfully done.  Director Denis Villeneuve was able to slowly take the viewer through calm and terror with efficacy and the storyline buildup of wondering what happened to Nawal Marwan during the search of her son.  What will Jeanne and Simon discover?  Suffice to say, what the two discover is quite shocking, what her children would learn about their father and the brother the never knew they had... it's an ending that I never saw coming.

Villeneuve was quite wise in utilizing cinematographer Andre Turpin to give us the visual images showcasing the violence and terror that Nawal Marwan had to live through.  From having her baby taken away from her after giving birth, a woman who kept strong during torture and rape and managed to keep this secret buried within her for decades until giving her two twin children the chance to learn of her past life but also continue what she had been doing for so long, to find her son but also giving her children the chance to find their father.

It's hard to believe such a powerful film was based on a play but the wonderfully directed and screenplay adaptation is what makes ""Incendies"" work, balanced with a wonderful performance by the film's leading ladies Lubna Azabal and Melissa Desoremeaux-Poulin.  And once again, this film reinforces how location is important.  By watching the film on Blu-ray and then watching the making of the film special feature, you realize that in order to capture the realism of what the women had to undertake, you have to be in the area, among the people who have suffered from the war. It was quite intriguing to watch the behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film.

But a question that I have been asked is which film did you enjoy better ""Incendies"" or ""In a Better World"". Both films were nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and the latter took home the award.  And while both films are fantastic, if I had to nitpick to find faults is the fact that ""Incendies"" may confuse people with the flashbacks of Nawal's story and Jeanne's story, some may not understand the context of why Nawal's family was disgraced (in this case, Nawal being Christian and having a relationship with a Muslim refugee).

If one does the research, they will learn that the story of ""Incendies"" originally by Wajdi Mouawad, a man who emigrated to Canada from the war-torn Lebanon.  But the setting of ""Incendies"" was not meant to be about any country, if anything, the country is unnamed, the film was shot in North Jordan but for those who are familiar with the conflicts among Muslims, Christians and the Palestinian refugees will probably understand the conflict and how the scenes of ""Incendies"" will no doubt strike a chord among viewers.

Perhaps that lack of understanding factored into the judges decisions but it's important to note that both films are wonderful but are very different in context.  And with the spotlight on bullying and school violence around the world and featured so much in the media, that is probably the biggest advantage that ""In a Better World"" had over ""Incendies"".  That the film probably had more relevance to American viewers.

But while ""Incendies"" did not win the Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", it did win multiple awards and the film has pretty much received mostly positive reviews from the film critics around the world.  It is a great film, well-directed, well-written, well-cast and features a great performance by its cast.

It doesn't have the banality of other films, if anything, it's a unique film that yes, it is a family tragedy film but in the end, love conquers all...and that is all that matters.

""Incendies"" is fantastic and if you are a cineaste, this film is a must-watch, must-own film!  Highly recommended.",1323993600,2,6593,5.01010101010101

If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.

With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the ""Phalangists"", are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a ""refugee"" not as a ""Palestinian"". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a ""kindly"" Muslim warlord (""Chamseddine"") happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the ""son"" and the ""father"". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat--one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.

As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position--why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.

While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?

And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.

I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.

'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release.",1321747200,12,5457,4.835117773019272

The puzzle's solution hinges on some ludicrous coincidences, but the surprise is emotional enough that it doesn't matter. The civil war flashbacks have a curiously intimate feel; the director wisely focuses on scenes of brutal aftermath rather than full-scale battles. The mix of anti-war polemic and family melodrama balances out nicely. 7/10",1320364800,2,591,5.231578947368421

1707493,3,B000065R11,"""Death is rarely the end of the story,"" says the Canadian notary entrusted with presenting the will of his secretary Nawal (Lubna Azabal) to her twin children. Indeed. The tragic secret carried by this deceased Lebanese immigrant will sear her children forever.

The film's major weakness is its setting in a fictionalized Middle Eastern nation. By removing the story from the real-life context of war-torn Lebanon, director Denis Villeneuve (and playwright Wajdi Mouawad) strip away meaning and historical framework for understanding the mother's ideological strivings. I suppose the idea is to universalize the harrowing outcomes of war, but the fictionalizing device only heightens confusion in an already hard-to-follow plot.

In searching for the truth about their family, the twins ultimately realize that they did not really know the woman who was their mother. Not only that, but her understandable quest for revenge risks destroying not just her intended victim, but her innocent twins as well. Because this is a mystery, I do not want to reveal too much.

1707509,5,B000065R11,"INCENDIES began as a play of the same name by Wajdi Mouawad and was opened up as only cinema can do by the author with the assistance of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and consultant Val&eacute;rie Beaugrand-Champagne. The result is a staggeringly powerful film whose story is so well revealed by a cast of sterling actors that telling too much of the plot would be a disservice  to those who come to this experience for the first time. In this viewer's opinion it is simply one of the finest films of the decade and it bound to become a permanent part of the cinematic library.

The opening of the film reveals many clues as to the direction the story will take. In a stark room young boys are having their hair shorn: one of the boys as a tattoo on his heal - three aligned dots on the Achilles tendon. After this unsettling beginning the camera moves to Canada in the office of notary Jean Lebel (R&eacute;my Girard) who has the responsibility of executing the will of his secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal in an illuminating performance that plays through the entire film) and presenting the will to Nawal's Lebanese-Canadian twin children Jeanne (M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) Marwan. The will divides Nawal's worldly goods equally between the children, but describes in detail how the deceased mother is to be buried (naked, face down, with no coffin in an unmarked grave) and provides two letters charging Jeanne  and Simon to find the father and brother they did not even know existed. The remainder of the film moves back and forth between the past and the present as the twins attempt to find their living relatives and the story of how Nawal's life was an unbelievable nightmare. Nawal was a Christian Lebanese, had a lover who was a Palestinian, and when her lover is killed she realizes she is pregnant, shaming her family and thus forced to give up her boy child to an orphanage - but not before her grandmother sensitively tattooed the three dots on his heel for future recognition.  From that point Nawal becomes a mathematician, a hired killer, is imprisoned and tortured and once again becomes a mother.  The twins trace clues as detectives to follow the rocky road of Nawal's life and make discoveries that are astonishing.

Though Lubna Azabal is clearly the central star of this film, the entire cast particularly M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as the twins is exemplary.  Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the  moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins.  This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful.  The cinematography by Andr&eacute; Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy.  The musical score by Gr&eacute;goire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtlely.  But in the end it is the sensitive direction of Denis Villeneuve that brings with human tragedy of a story alive.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 11",1317081600,32,3215,4.8968692449355435
1707510,4,B000065R11,"I was very entertained and emotionally moved by this excellent movie. I thought it was great!

The essence of this movie is how children can take for granted the origins of their parents, the sacrifices that may be made for them and how incredibly lucky a person they may be.

A mother dies and the intentions of her will are revealed to her twin, adult-age children. This Canadian brother and sister are asked to deliver sealed letters to a father and brother that they never even knew existed. This quest directs them into an unfamiliar and sometimes threatening Middle East country (most likely Lebanon). As they seek to unravel their mother's history, they learn of things that they never knew and some that they would have never wanted to know.

As there is a search to uncover the mother's past, at the same time, the film also chronicles the incredible plight that their mother took in her own life. Similar to ""Godfather II"", there are two simultaneous stories being told. The mother, Christian-born, is caught between the deadly amd illogical feuding between Muslims and Christians. Although not graphic or exploitative, this film depicts the crazy, senseless and ruthless violence fought. The scenes are quite chilling and shocking.

Eventually, these twins learn about their cultural origins which tie them to this foreign land in a manner a lot closer than these Canadians anticipated.

There are some legitimate criticizms about the movie. The film jumps all over the place, chronologically, without full explanations as to how characters (primarily the mother) arrived there. Towards the end, there is a sense of melodrama that may seem too contrived, too unbelievable for some viewers. I have noticed that some detractors have a problem with the historical and demographical inaccuracies.

Look, this is a movie not a documentary. It emenates from a play. I don't believe that a whale would purposely sink a ship but I, nonetheless, still love ""Moby Dick"". This is an expertly directed film that is meticulous in it's depiction yet always riveting. The performances are first rate. The pacing makes for great entertainment. Whether realistically acceptable or not, the climax of this movie is unexpected, moving and acts as a very satisfactory ending.

I enjoy foreign movies because they can get away from the routine slop that comes out of mainstream, Hollywood cinema. It's showing entertainment from a different angle than I am used to and I really appreciate that.

This was a great, entertaining story, involving a subject matter that is rarely examined in the movies and the flick packed a powerful emotional whallop when the credits came up.

Big thumbs up, warts and all!",1316563200,5,2695,5.051801801801802
1707511,5,B000065R11,"I sense the ire here and with my customers as to why these combo packs are so frustrating in not being able to obtain the DVD only for purchase. This film impacted me so greatly though, I wish there was a way I could buy a thousand of these and split them up so everyone could watch this extraordinary film. The Amazon editorial description words much better than I could think up, how this plot ravels and unravels. I just wanted to hit a quick Blu review.

The picture is flawless, and once you watch the documentary, you realize how fortunate we all are that the end result turned out this pristine. The dark scenes are transferred without fault, even to the point of the moving flashlights in the river and the nurse taking the first child away in the night (the scenes after each birth) being solid in detail and color. So then one should be happy knowing with how Villeneuve does both his long landscape shots and even lengthier face-in-the-frame-forever styles - that it merits this Blu as being some of the best clarity and vivid detail preservation I have seen for a film of this make.

The DTS is not overwhelming and actually appeared to be mixed well enough to where I could hear everything at low levels and higher ranges. Probably the only complaint I had was the crying baby scene being mixed so well (and loud) I wanted to turn it down. The music/score is not overwhelming and really only appears at the right moments but it went through the outer channels very appropriately.

The main special feature is a 44-minute making-of that is worth the watch and actually well produced. It even showed the simplicity of the surrounding society while filming (reference the goat herder talking to his stock in the beginning). I appreciate the little things in a film, and there are so many that percolate throughout this entire piece. Region coded A, the DVD is a bare bones disc so neither the documentary nor the commentary are on it.

This film is not for the weak of heart.  It deals with the basest of human failures and it leaves the viewer emotionally exhausted.  However, the film is well worth watching for many reasons.  The acting, although not outstanding, is very good.  The various characters are victims of different abuses yet most of them carry an innocence that is well-displayed.  There is a variety of locations and a variety of cultural settings and issues that are very engrossing, sometimes almost too engrossing.  The back and forth from present to past is very well done and greatly enhances the the suspense of the movie.

The ultimate message that I took from ""Incendies"" was the depth to which hatred can destroy otherwise decent people.  The innocence I previously mentioned about some of the characters is a key to the success of ""Incendies"".  In a war-torn Lebanon there are good and bad but it is the innocents that make us take a personal involvement in the events that take place.  What do we do with that involvement?
