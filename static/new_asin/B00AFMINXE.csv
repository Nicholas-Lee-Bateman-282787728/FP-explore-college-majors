8550992,4,B00AFMINXE,"Snippets are from a movie I saw at the midnight show back in Staten Island New York called ""Rock & Roll Your Eyes"". It's some good older footage, but like the many unofficial videos, there are bad edits, partial shows . For a true ELP fan, I liked it, but it is NOT a full length show, just bits and pieces.",1481587200,,307,4.049180327868853

8550994,4,B00AFMINXE,"After my disappointment with the EagleRock DVD for ELP, ""The Birth Of A Band; Live At The Isle of Wight"", I was pleasantly surprised by the ELP ""On A Knife Edge"" DVD.  The video gets 4 stars for showing multi-camera raw footage of ELP in a small concert setting during the early days of the band.  I am not sure of the venue or concert date, and the DVD packaging does not give any details.  But I believe that it is 1970.  Drawbacks are that it does not include the full show, the tracks are out of order, the audio is a little weak and irregular, and the video occasionally cuts to the screen backdrop that ELP used in their early shows.  This is most evident in the Carl Palmer drum solo.  But it was only slightly annoying.  As expected the video spends most of the time on Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer, but this DVD shows more of Greg Lake than other video I have seen from the same time period.  If you are a fan of historical ELP video I recommend you pick up this disc.",1420243200,8,978,4.164893617021277
