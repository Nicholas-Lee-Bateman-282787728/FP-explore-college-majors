6604413,5,B00MXYG3M0,"P.G. Wodehouse wrote funny stories. Obscenely hilarious comedy stories about dim young aristocrats, overbearing aunts and very clever servants.

And of all his creations, the most memorable is the ill-fated and blue-blooded Bertie Wooster and his megabrained valet Jeeves, immortalized by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. ""The Complete Jeeves & Wooster"" brings together all their madcap, bizarre little adventures in England's upper echelons, with many a disastrous engagement, terrifying aunt, crazy madcap scheme and/or stint in prison.

Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is in need of a valet, and after a wild night out, the low-key, brainy manservant Jeeves (Fry) is sent by an agency to deal with Bertie's everyday needs. But Jeeves doesn't just fold Bertie's hankies and give him hangover tonics -- he keeps Bertie out of all kinds of trouble. Predatory young beauties, ditzy idiot pals of Bertie's, and domineering aunts trying to marry him off, Bertie is always in hot water -- and Jeeves always is on hand, with a plot cooking in his impressive brain, to haul his hapless employer out.

Among the many problems they have to tackle: a stolen cow creamer, a little book of insults directed at an amateur Hitler, a starvation tactic that ends in disaster, American millionaires, a flirtation with fatherhood, scandalous memoirs, Bingo Little's countless infatuations, the havoc wreaked by mustaches, pearl necklaces going missing, and many compromising situations that begin -- or end -- unwanted engagements.

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is quite faithful to Wodehouse's original stories -- some stories are combined and others are separated, but they draw heavily on his kooky, bizarro prose and distinct view of the world. Not to mention a sort of alternate between-wars England full of glamour and a merry-go-round of oft-broken engagements, with Jeeves as the calm in the storm's eye.

The only problem is that the stories set in New York just don't have that delicious British flavour that the rest of the series does, although they're still quite funny. That, and the cast changes continuously -- only a few of Bertie's friends and acquaintances retain the same actor throughout the series.

But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every episode is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, overbearing aunts, mixups, blackmail, newts, meddling aunts and young women ranging from devious to airy-fairy -- often all of the above. And yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (""Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!"" ""Do butterflies do that?"").

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves. Though Bertie's lack of clothing sense (and a trombone) often annoys Jeeves, the brainy valet clearly does have affection for Bertie, and Bertie appreciates Jeeves' ability to save him from fates worse than death (such as marriage to the horribly hearty Honoria or the wispy, fairy-loving dimbulb Madeleine).

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is a simply brilliant stretch of what-ho-what-ho comedy (""You can't be a successful dictator AND design women's underclothing"") and deliciously twisting storylines. Not to be missed. Ever.",1409097600,33,3367,5.292134831460674

Much of the screenplay is in fact word-for-word from the Wodehouse text, and couldn't have been better portrayed than by Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry. When I re-read the novels, it's the Laurie and Fry voices that ""play"" in my mind.

My only lament is that many of the actors for various roles were replaced or changed around. With each successive season, you need to make a serious effort to figure out Who's Who. While some of the actor substitutions were almost unnoticeable (the aunts), others were a real shame (the original Barmy and Gussie were just precious).",1485907200,,618,4.775700934579439

6604437,3,B00MXYG3M0,"If you enjoy PG Wodehouse then you will undoubtedly know all about this collection. So why are you reading this review.buy it!

If you're unfamiliar with PG well, then you should become familiar with his witty and brilliant writings. This series is Wodehouses most popular. If youve ever wondered where the saying Ask Jeeves came from, this is it.

This series retells the comical mishaps and lost loves of the happy-go-lucky Bertie Wooster. Stephen Fry is the essence of Bertie Wooster and while Id pictured Jeeves to be a bit older Hugh Laurie plays the role perfectly. Im not sure there could ever be a more perfect Bertie and Jeeves.

Unfortunately that is not the case with all the actors in the series. Several of the key characters are played by a different actor throughout the series and it makes it rather hard to keep track of who is who. Its downright frustrating to be honest. And while most episodes are stand alone they build on the other and the characters cross and refer back to earlier events.

And, as good as this TV series is, its NOTHING compared to the books. Still one has to judge each media on its own merits I suppose.",1465084800,2,1146,4.575609756097561

6604442,3,B00MXYG3M0,"This was a surprising disappointment to me.  If you watch the first few minutes of episode one of season one, you'll see Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, hung over, making faces, groaning, trying to distinguish a doorbell from a phone, staggering around, and mugging and hamming it up to beat the band.  And that pretty much illustrated for me what was wrong with this series.  The books are funny because of how Bertie narrates the events, with his casual overstatements and colorful turns of phrase.  The events aren't that hilarious, it's the narration of the events that makes them special.  So watching Bertie drunk, or watching silly situations unfold, with pratfalls and chases and the like, just doesn't seem as great as reading Bertie's narration of those same events.  So I'm not sure these stories really translate to the screen that well.

Before all the lovers of this series begin to curse me for this opinion, let me point out that there is a lot to like in this series as well:

1.  Stephen Fry's Jeeves was perfect.

2.  The production values are excellent.  Great sets, costumes, art direction. The settings in London clubs and in country estates (even ""Downtown Abbey"" appears in one episode!) and also the New York settings, with the art deco designs and jazz clubs, are well done.  I had expected a lower-budget look to it.

3.  Some of the minor and recurring characters are well played, especially the blonde version of Madeline, both of the Gussies, both of the Aunt Agathas, and the twins playing the twins.

But there are other disappointments, too.  One is suggested by point 3, above:  over the four years of the series, many of the recurring characters are played by different actors from season to season.  The result is that they fail to make the impression that they should.  Many of them just merge together, and the less successful portrayals are somewhat bland.  Also, the British actors playing Americans often have very weird accents, as though Ethel Merman and John Wayne are the standards of American diction.

The music is also interesting.  The theme song is catchy and appropriate for the era.  There are some fun musical moments where Bertie entertains himself with pop tunes of the day, and we're treated to jazz clubs in the seasons set in the US.  But whoever did the scoring also emphasized the slapstick aspects of the series as well, with muted trumpets going ""Wah wah waaaaaah,"" when someone has a pratfall or fails in some silly attempt.  I felt I was watching a Three Stooges movie at times, or a 50s sitcom, and the scoring reinforced that.

These were somewhat fun to watch, but were not as successful in my view as I expected.  Hugh Laurie's mugging did seem to decrease as the series progressed.  Fry was consistently good throughout.",1462579200,10,2788,4.786163522012578
6604443,5,B00MXYG3M0,"I've read (and reread) all of Wodehouse's Jeeves and Bertie books and love them. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are PERFECT in these roles, as are the other continuing characters. A younger Martin Clunes of the popular Doc Martin show plays one of the continuing roles of Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps.  Even if you haven't read the books, you'll enjoy these.

The purists who hang onto every written of the printed stories may lodge a complaint or two in various places, but having read the books myself, I still found the DVDs well worth watching.  Stephen Fry carries out the role of Jeeves 'spot on' with an incredibly expressive 'deadpan' delivery. Hugh Laurie's characterization of Bertie Wooster brings the latter's cluelessness to an art form. The chemistry is there in full force.  The only caveat that I have is the plot resolution in a couple of the episodes do not match with Wodehouse's style. Other than that, it was well worth the time and money invested.",1453852800,,698,4.808333333333334

As others have noted here in their reviews this edition of the Jeeves and Wooster series is gorgeous to look at. I already owned this DVD collection but on another, older set put out by A&E. Watching those older DVDs recently I was struck by the rather poor quality of them. The colors were muted and there was a fuzzy, almost matte texture to the whole look of them. Based on other reviews of this set I purchased it and immediately noticed a difference in the look of the DVDs. The matte, textured look of the older DVDs is gone and these newer DVDs look beautiful. The colors are bright and glowing and everything is sharper and clean. The price of this newer set is a bargain, at just over $31.00. Well worth the money to buy, even if you already own the series.

ETA: (02/16/17) I just noticed that the price of this set went waaay up sometime after I posted my original review. It was $31.00 and now it's about double that. I would still recommend buying it though, or at least seeking it out elsewhere at a better price.",1432252800,4,1142,4.336448598130841

Jeeves, is Valet, is extremely bright and saves the day.  But I have always been a fan of P. G. Wodehouse.  It is the British upperclasses during 1930's, and the author's hilarious interpretation of their intricate social life turned to sheer havoc.  I think that P. G.

6604504,5,B00MXYG3M0,"I do not believe that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie played Reginald Jeeves and Bertie Wooster. The spirit of Wodehouse through the characters of Jeeves and Wooster infiltrated the living presences of Fry and Laurie and for 23 wonderful episodes walked the earth and brought us back to 1920's England. There is such a remarkable chemistry between Fry and Hugh that is magical and inexplicable.

For those who don't know the story, Wooster is the stupid aristocrat who leaps into turbulent waters without looking and his valet, Jeeves, must rescue him from drowning in bad judgment. However, Jeeves is incapable of instilling any kind of good sense into his employer, although he always tries. In many ways Jeeves and Wooster is a modern day ""Marriage of Figaro"", however here the lower social class mentors the upper and even saves them for themselves.

Bertie is not the only fool populated in Wodehouse's world. Much of the young male English upper-crust is portrayed as bumbling inept fools who have too much time on their idle hands, conniving and scheming in strange and frivolous exploits. And Bertie Wooster is the quintessential heir to not only stupidity but a large family fortune. In short, Bertie is a scatterbrain's scatterbrain who would bet (and lose) the entire family estate on the local sack race and then have to explain to his Aunt Agatha that it was a sure thing. But his plans do not end with monetary exploits. Bertie would push a young boy off a bridge in order that one of his colleagues would rescue him in order to impress a young woman, only to have it backfire. It is Jeeves who always comes to the rescue. Jeeves is far more worldly. His understanding of human nature is in direct proportion to Bertie's lack of good sense. Wooster and Jeeves go together in much the same way as Kirk and Spock.

Some in the aristocracy apparently complained of Wodehouse's portrayals of the upper classes which is to be expected. The unspoken and yet apparent message of Jeeves and Wooster, aside from the entertaining comedy that monopolizes the forefront of the stories, is an interesting criticism of privilege. Whether or not this was Wodehouse's intention is debatable, but the underlying message appears quite apparent.

Although harmlessly benign (except being his own worst enemy), Bertie Wooster is a cherry short of a fruitcake, and yet is bestowed with all the advantages of a young aristocrat. He studied at Eton and Oxford University, yet little of his studies remains with him, except for his aptitude at sophomoric pranks. Jeeves, on the contrary, has much practical knowledge to boot and can quote Shakespeare with ease. But Jeeves is from the working class. Jeeves might have excelled at a place like Oxford but would not be accepted because of the social status of his family. He can only secure a job as a valet to an idiotic aristocrat who was handed these things to him on a gold-rimmed platter and takes for granted the status given to him. And yet, with all the tom-foolery exhibited by Bertie Wooster, the Jeeves tales may have in fact re-enforced class distinction in Great Britain although it was often scorned by the upper classes. The lower classes needed Jeeves to remind them of the oft inferiority of the upper class. Jeeves gives them an outlet to express the unfairness of privilege and its inherit hypocrisies. I hope these stories not only entertained but have given the middle and lower classes reason to insist on changing the hierarchical landscape: a meritocracy instead of an aristocracy. Jeeves would have definitely approved.",1430179200,,3578,4.899339933993399

The sound has been very nicely enhanced and accompanied by subtitles which makes all the difference, as many of the words sadly melted into gobbledegook on the previous editions, though the stereo image still is quite narrow. There is one strange instance, though, in the third episode of season three, Opening on Broadway, in which there is a film montage with many transitions concerning the long U.S.-wide tour of the ridiculous musical Ask Dad! with which Bertie is traveling where a piece of the old, badly decayed print is featured  it obviously has been cleaned as well as possible, but the difference is incredibly noticeable when one has become so deliciously used to the gorgeous new transfer which comprises the rest both the episode and the series. Nevertheless, one of the classics of British comedy has been brought back to life with all the joy and power of any Christ or Osiris.

6604541,5,B00MXYG3M0,"2014 DVD Complete Collection (Acorn) set has SDH subtitles. SPOT ON!

Same zany comedy of the British Odd Couple of the early 90s. Wooster is rich, one of the elite aristocrat spiffy class that is so filthy rich he only plays. No work. All the work is performed by his valet Jeeves. He's also the brainiest of the pair and often is just in time in getting Bertie Wooster out of comical predicaments. Wooster is a bachelor and intends to remain that way, even if all the gorgeous aristocrat flappers of the period are after this prize catch. It is unrated but expect PG-LOL. It is the 1920 era so you also get some fantastic up-scale Roaring Twenties sets, costumes, autos (oh the autos), lingo and props. It's the cat's meow.

The leads are played by Hugh Laurie as Bertie and Stephen Fry as straight man with a heart and brain as big as his body. This has been around for a while, but being period costume comedy/drama it never goes out of style. 23 episodes covered 4 seasons, each 50+ minutes designed for an hour TV spot. The British loved it, and then America caught on; just like Downton Abbey. But this is nothing like Downton, by cracky. It is slapstick crazy vaudeville, smartly like The Three Stooges among the British intelligent society. Episodes are largely made up of non-recurring cast, as only a handful have multiple appearances, and 8 of the 23 is the maximum, other than the 2 leads who are in all.
Caution: do not watch all of the episodes at once. It makes your face hurt from laughing, even when watching the series for the 2nd or 3rd time. A bonny British blockbuster, the bee's knees.

If you enjoy the writings of P.G. Wodehouse, or simply like stress releasing laughter, this is as crazy as British humor gets with a storyline. A lot of the original Wodehouse dialogue has been incorporated into the film adapts.
