1234671,5,B00000JMPG,This collection is a must for Monty Python fans.  I didn't realize how many of their classic sketches were in the first season.  I loved this collection so much that I bought the next one also.  I only wish that I had more time to watch them.,1012521600,2,242,4.1063829787234045
1234672,4,B00000JMPG,"There's not much I can add about Monty Python - their comic legends. This box set should be owned, as each episode is hilarious. My only complaint is regarding the packaging. Although the tape quality is excellent, why package only two 30 minute episodes per tape when it is possible to pack 3 or 4? This kinda bugged me, as I was paying 15 bucks for each 1 hour tape. Keep this in mind when buying these.",987724800,4,405,4.2727272727272725
1234673,5,B00000JMPG,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: The Funniest Joke In The World, The Mouse Problem, Children's Stories, Restaurant Sketch, Undressing In Public, the generally superb Episode Five, The Dull Life Of A City Stockbroker, Man Turns Into Scotsman, Dead Parrot, Buying A Bed, Homicidal Barber(/Lumberjack Song) and Walk-On Part In Sketch.
Own it!",969926400,4,591,5.103092783505154
1234674,5,B00000JMPG,"If you saw the Monty Python episodes on commercial teevee, you expected to see a lot less than the non-commerical British stations showed for such is the fact of life in these United States. But those who saw them on PBS  might have reasonably expected to see uncut versions; and until I saw the  first three tapes in the upcoming series soon to be made available to the  general public by the A&E people, I thought I was getting (forgive this  one) the Full Monty!!! Witness my delight, then, when I saw not only parts  of sketches that were never included in the PBS airings but also an entire  hysterically funny sketch of home movies of Queen Victoria having a merry  romp on the lawn with Gladstone. So it is not my purpose here to make you  want to see these sketches which vary from utterly tasteless to genuinely  Swiftian; but to advise you that they contain a considerable amount more  than met your eye in the past. And if that is not a motivation to buy these  tapes, then you should join a local Mouse Club and cheese it. But for  something completely different, these are the sets for all lovers of  Lumberjacks, Nudge Nudge, and Upper Class Twits of the Year. And thank you,  A&E for making them finally available in their pristine manifestations.",935366400,37,1262,4.5265486725663715

1234694,5,B00000JMPG,"If you love the Monty Python gang, then you HAVE to get this! It's a riot! I always loved this show, but I have especially come to appreciate the genius of Graham Chapman, now that I'm watching these sketches as an older person. You MUST get it!",1398211200,,245,4.23404255319149
1234695,5,B00000JMPG,"Don't think the Circus was coming out of nowhere, you have to listen to the Goon Show to understand where they got their humor - they were derivative but deliciously so, they took what the goons did on radio (and later TV) and took it to new, more ridiculous heights. The first season starts a bit unsteadily, but they soon find their balance and some of the classic skits come out of this first year.",1389312000,,401,4.36

1234698,2,B00000JMPG,I have a hard time understanding the actors. The British way of talking is hard to understand. But a classic.,1371686400,,109,4.5
1234699,5,B00000JMPG,"I first viewed this episode when it came out. I was either in High School or college. I don't smoke pot anymore, and the writers had the good stuff, but this show is still extremely funny!

A classic by all measures-but very hard to explain to some people-especially Koreans or Chinese who have a tough time with the preposterous English language.

Anyone who was there must have this!

1234700,5,B00000JMPG,"These episodes, as we all know, are hilariously funny. Whether you pay $0.00 or $1,000 to watch an episode, the price doesn't affect the content of the program.
Flying Circus is a must-watch classic.
For all the one-star reviews; reviews are meant for the product, not its price-point or distributor. Complain about Amazon Prime elsewhere. You succeed only in irritating folk who are looking for actual product reviews by griping here.

1234704,1,B00000JMPG,"I'll be honest, I didn't watch it. I was excited because the seasons said they were free for prime members, but when clicking upon them, they require a purchase.

7912646,5,B00000JMPG,"It's always funny. It's the standard with which we judge funny. I guess some people won't like it because it's unusual, but nothing is really universally liked. Monty Python seems to me to be the beginning of a modern comedy sensibility. Without them we have no Steve Martin, David Letterman, or Howard Stern. If I had to choose one comedy in any format to watch on my last day, it would be Monty Python's Flying Circus.",1483401600,,420,4.5394736842105265
