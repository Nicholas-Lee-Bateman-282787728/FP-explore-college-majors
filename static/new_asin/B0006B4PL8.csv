8041028,1,B0006B4PL8,This was a huge disappointment-have been a Tae Bo fan for over 13 years and was excited to see this quick workout for those rushed mornings-even doing all 8 rounds I did not sweat or feel worked at all-it was soooo slow moving even for a Beginner and it made me feel as though I had to do a workout post workout-it was as if he was too lazy to put any effort into choreographing a routine and just wanted to put out a new DVD-I actually threw this away as my copy was used anyway-don't bother with this,1511740800,,502,4.08080808080808

I do , so I did enjoy this for a quick work out when I have little time
It's fun and fitness especially when you play your music with it

8041033,5,B0006B4PL8,"I just did this program this morning for the first time.

It has about an 8 or so minutes of warm up then moves directly into 8 short rounds of about a minute or so each.

Billy first shows each exercise slowly and then you move into the faster versions of the exercises.

I actually did the program two times in a row because the first time thru I didn't get all the moves, but the second time was able to flow much easier.

Surprisingly, I worked up a decent sweat doing it and then went into my next workout (Pilates for this morning).

Basically I would say that this program is not a full workout in itself but works best as a cardio warmup (much the way you might use a stationary bike or a treadmill to warm up before doing something else).

Still, for someone who only has a short amount of time on a given day and wants to do ""something"", then surely doing this alone is better than doing nothing at all.

Between the warmups and the ""power rounds"" you get some flexibility, core strength (in the warm ups he does a one-arm plank which you can do on your knees or in a full plank position), and then you get your heart rate up a bit with the actual power rounds.

For my purposes this is a great ""add-on"" workout and I'm happy I have it available to use that way.

 Some additional observations:

It seems that this program is made up from edited segments of a longer program.

The only thing I'd consider negative is that sometimes Billy does more reps on one side than the other, though this seems to happen w/ Tae Bo programs. Still, the good outweighs the bad. When I find him doing extra on a given side I just alternate sides on my own to make them more even.",1196467200,5,1674,4.196875
