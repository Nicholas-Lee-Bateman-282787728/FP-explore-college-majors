8718836,4,B00YQTCPAO,"I am going to be the disenter on this movie.  Believe it or not, I enjoyed this film.  OK, the production values were in the toilet.  The acting was Cheesey.  The dubing was DEFINATELY bad.  And it was definately soft core porn with Giallo thrown into it.
  First & foremost, I LOVE my cheese.  Next, while there is the heavy soft core element (But can we really forget John Derreck's films that had that soft core porn aspect to them?), it was in the context of the Giallo element.  Which was basically, murders during sexual encounters.  And this was definately a few steps above the usuall B-rate movie from Italy at the time as well.  The picture restoration was excellent.  While the extras were minimal, they were very interesting to watch.
  This movie isn't for everyone.  It definately is soft porn in nature.  And should not be watched by those under 18 who just won't understand that there is more going on than a bunch of nudity.
  And last but not least, this film should not be taken that seriously, I know that the cast & crew ahad a great time in making it the playful film that it was",1452124800,2,1101,4.42
8718837,3,B00YQTCPAO,"Play Motel falls into the category of Italian sexploitation thriller. Directed by Mario Gariazzo, the film opens at the garishly illuminated Play Motel where several buxom blondes are being secretly photographed while having kinky sex. The motel, just outside of town, is the destination of rich, respectable men who come to live out their perverted sexual fantasies with accommodating call girls. Rinaldo Cortesi (Enzo Fisichella) is an upper-class citizen who discreetly picks up a sexy blonde woman named Loredana (Marina Frajese) in the lobby of the Play Motel and brings her to an upstairs room. More than pleasure awaits him.

Because director Gariazzo is obsessed with elaborate soft core-style sex scenes, the plot is often hard to follow. The film has a creepy allure, though many viewers will be bored by the far-too-lengthy displays of flesh rather than titillated. The plot hinges on a blackmail scheme directed against affluent male visitors to the establishment. There are the makings of a decent thriller lurking in the plot, but its unfortunately not developed adequately. The screenplay could use a solid dose of Agatha Christie polish. Acting is pretty good, even though the performers have to slog their way through unimaginative dialogue and a sluggish pace.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a booklet containing background production information, original cover art, and the featurette Midas Touch, about the production company that made Play Motel.",1445472000,4,1484,5.392241379310345

Once again I have to state beforehand that older movies need to be viewed in the context of when they were made rather than watching them as if they were made last week. With that in mind I watched the Kino Lorber blu-ray release of PLAY MOTEL, a movie made in 1979 that combines the soft core Eurotrash genre with the giallo genre and does so effectively for fans of both.

The story involves a blackmail scheme that takes place in a hotel catering to secret rendezvous between lovers. While one room offers the accoutrements of kinky sex (everything from whips and chains to costumes) the room next door has a two way mirrored view of the room for the nefarious photographer. The first person we see blackmailed considers what to do when the demand comes his way.

That all changes when his wife finds the photos and then goes to the hotel herself. There, she finds the second room and begins watching another couple having sex. As she does so a mysterious, gloved figure approaches her from behind and strangles her. It isn't until later that a young couple who were staying in the hotel find her body in the trunk of their car when they have a flat tire.

The couple connect with the police who talk to the husband. It turns out the blackmail victim and his wife were in the process of getting a divorce. He now cooperates with the police in the investigation. At the same time the police recruit the young couple who found the body. Fortunately for them the man is an actor on break. He and his wife are more than willing to help.

Things take a turn for the worse when the woman involved in the first blackmail attempt is found murdered shortly after being questioned by the police. Her place of employment is a porn magazine and the publisher there was once wanted for white slavery. The staff immediately become the main suspects as the police and the couple theyve brought in try to find out not just who is involved in the blackmail scheme but the murderer as well.

This is a solid enough story but more inclined to fill out an hour long program at best. Which means that it leaves at least 30 minutes to bring on enough skin to qualify as soft core porn, the R rated stuff that was prevalent in the 70s. If you're a fan of either genre you should find enough here to hold your interest from start to finish.

What I found more interesting was the extra that discussed the company behind the movie and how things were done at the time. The film was released in two versions back then, one the R rated version all of the actors were well aware of and then an X rated version where lookalike actors were brought in to perform more pornographic scenes. These were made for markets that were beginning to boom with that sort of film like France even though they were banned in Italy, the country the film was made in.

Also included for those curious about those special scenes are the extra sequences that were made for the X rated versions of the film. While they are indeed graphic they are a far cry from things found by curious teens on the internet these days. From a historical point of view this can be interesting, but if you're looking to be titillating then there are other ways to do so.

The movie does offer a good giallo here and the actors do a great job for what would seem a low budget film. In the end fans will have a new film worth adding to their collection.",1440547200,14,3443,4.384012539184953
