The Squaw Man, Cecil B. DeMille's first film, was an ambitious one for 1914--it runs just about 80 minutes and used a great many sets mixed with outdoor locations in California (then a brand new place for filmmakers) and Director/Co-Producer Cecil B. DeMille (with co-Director Oscar Apfel) demanded a lot of their actors--and most of the way through the film they got it without too much overacting! Most of the acting is convincing and the plot moves along at a very good pace. It's also notable that the film doesn't hesitate to deal with subject matter that was taboo at the time, especially miscegenation although certain aspects of the plot would be embarrassingly dated today. The accompanying musical score works well to enhance the film even further. The film's flaws are mostly attributable to the fact that filmmaking was still a new art form and a way to tell a story, so for example we see not enough intertitles which a few times made me review a few minutes of the film to fully comprehend what was going on. In addition, once or twice a scene was filmed from the wrong angle so it didn't look completely right when I watched it but the actions and events were almost always understandable.

When the action starts, we quickly meet British Captain James Wynnegate - aka Jim Carston in America (Dustin Farnum) and his cousin Sir Henry - Earl of Kerhill (Monroe Salisbury). It isn't long before Sir Henry steals money from an orphans fund and makes it look as if James stole it instead! After some begging and pleading from The Dowager Lady Elizabeth Kerhill (Mrs. A.W. Filson), James agrees to take the blame for stealing the money especially if it will save the honor of Lady Diana - Countess of Kerhill (Winifred Kingston), a woman James loves--and then James decides to leave England for America where he can start a new life.

And there's much more to the plot than just this. James' (who now goes by the name Jim) journey to American leads him into danger on the high seas; a friendship with Big Bill (Dick La Reno) who convinces Jim to travel with him out West; relationships with Native Americans like Tabywana (Joseph Singleton) and Nat-U-Ritch (Princess Red Wing); an angry feud between Jim and Cash Hawkins (William Elmer) and so much more. I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy the story unfold as much as I did!

There are quite a few other actors in the film but the following truly deserve special mention. Look for Haidee Fuller as Lady Mabel Wynnegate; Fernando G&aacute;lvez as Sir John Applegate; Sydney Deane as Dean of Trenton; Lew Longenecker as a ship captain; Gordona Bennet as the captain's wife; Utahna La Reno as the ship captain's child; Freddy De Rue as Little Hal and J.G. Harper as a Justice of the Peace. Hal Roach has an uncredited role as a townsman and Cecil B. DeMille himself plays a Faro Dealer. Cecilia de Mille has an uncredited role as a child.

Overall, The Squaw Man remains a fine early film that showcases Cecil B. DeMille's talent from the start even if there are a few minor flaws in the film. De Mille certainly liked The Squaw Man--he remade the film twice! The actors all give good performances. I highly recommend this film for people interested in Cecil B. DeMille and the early years of motion picture development and history. In addition, people who appreciate silent film dramas with action and romance (especially set in the West) will not be disappointed.",1378857600,3,3441,4.690397350993377
8127460,4,B000FVQLYI,"""The Squaw Man"" may be billed as a silent classic for reasons such as being one of the first feature-length films (80 minutes to be exact) to be made in Southern California, as well as its huge success at the time, and consequently marking the start of Cecil B. DeMille's directing and filmmaking career.  Full length feature films were already being made in Europe and the East Coast of America in the early 1910s, and many of them were probably better in various ways than ""The Squaw Man"", but DeMille's first attempt at filmmaking nevertheless showed great potential, and it is still entertaining and interesting to watch in our day.  Credit must be given to Oscar Apfel, however, who was hired as an experienced director for ""The Squaw Man"" since DeMille had had only some stage acting, writing and producing experience until that time.  DeMille was officially the Director General and it is believed he supervised and did most of the editing for ""The Squaw Man"".  There are no DeMille trademarks yet to be seen in this film, but the many outdoor action scenes are not bad at all, and the overall fast pace of the film packs a lot of adventure into 80 minutes.  The story is based on a popular play which audiences were familiar with in the early 1900s, and it might help viewers today to know a little about the plot in advance because some scenes are quite short, and with not many intertitles it takes a bit of effort to keep up with the story and figure out what's happening at first.  Nevertheless, after viewing ""The Squaw Man"" a second time, I was able to follow the plot and enjoy the misadventure of an English nobleman forced to leave his home when framed by his cousin for stealing money from a Widows and Orphans fund.  He arrives in America and soon finds himself the owner of a cattle ranch in Wyoming and married to a squaw who saves his life by killing the town's troublemaker.  This murder remains unsolved for several years, however, during which time the cousin in England makes a dying confession.  The story must have been so popular that DeMille chose to remake ""The Squaw Man"" not once, but twice:  first in 1918 and then as an early sound film in 1931.  In this first 1914 version there are great outdoor scenes of plains and even snow and mountains which were said to be in Wyoming and Arizona at the time of the film's release, but in fact everything was filmed in Southern California.  Like most productions of this time, ""The Squaw Man"" lacks the smoothness and sophistication of silent films made in the mid to late 1920s, but for those of us who find pre-1920 films somehow more fascinating and fulfilling, I can certainly recommend this film.  It has survived in very good condition, and even on this budget label the picture quality is not too bad at all, and it is helped along nicely by a good and somewhat less traditional piano score.  Needless to say, this is a must-have for all serious DeMille fans as well as anyone interested in the early work of one of the great pioneers of the American film industry.",1157673600,18,3048,4.568807339449541
