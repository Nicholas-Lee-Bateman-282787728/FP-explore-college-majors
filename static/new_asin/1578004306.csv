196383,4,1578004306,"First off, the anime isn't ""suitable for ages 18 and up"", it's ages 13 and up, as the DVD cover says.
The Maze DVD features both OAV episodes, the first episode of the TV series, and Japanese and English audio tracks for the OAVs and TV series. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. As for story, you have your basic band of characters traveling from point A to point B to stop a power-crazed guy from impoverishing a country by constructing a tower in his name. Now, for the not-so-basic features. First off, the main character, Maze, turns into a man at night. And not just any man, an insanely sex-crazed man. Another character, Solude, is a woman attracted to Maze- the female Maze. Then there's Mill who's attracted to both male AND female Maze, and the fairy who hides inside Maze's shirt. You can probably guess that this anime has a lot of nudity. More than a lot, in fact.
Along with that, there is also a lot of comedy. The group at one point encounters a large dragon, to which they draw their weapons and assume battle positions- then realize they're not facing the right direction. After the dragon yells at them and they turn around, he introduces himself as Robulos. The group then repeats his name wrong. After Robulos yells the pronunciation of his name syllable by syllable, he challenges the group to a battle- a 100-question game show battle. And that's only one of the three dragons that the group has to fight, in equally bizarre situations. Interesting enough? There are some flaws though, like the terribly disappointing final battle, the lack of an opening theme, and the below average dubbing. Fortunately this is a dual-language DVD. Worthy of purchase.",992908800,2,1680,4.679054054054054
196384,3,1578004306,"Since this show was from the makers of the Slayers and Outlaw Star, I decided to look at this. I wasn't impressed. Not to say that I didn't find some ts amusing on this tape, like when a dragon asks the group hilarious question like when the next video release is, but there was one scene that was trying to be funny, but isnt. It was when male Maze rapes the king's daughter toned to funny music. What is so funny about rape? I know that it is trying to follow along the lines of Ranma 1\2, but that show never did anything this extreme. It's too bad. Maze seemed like it would be pretty good, and it is, but that one scene ruined the whole show for me. And looking at some of the other volumes (Traveling Playboy) I am not tempted into buying anymore of the tapes. Until this show can clean up it's act, I'll call Maze corn for now.",978393600,2,834,4.122699386503068
196385,1,1578004306,"Saying a particular program is bad anime is not to say that it's not a good watch; I sat mesmerized by how god awful Macross 2 was. Maze, however, physically cannot be watched - I got roughly 5 minutes into it before I had to turn it off and hide the DVD at the back of my collection. Take my advice - do NOT buy this.",976752000,9,318,3.8333333333333335
196386,1,1578004306,"Did I watch the same disc as everyone else? Because what I saw in 'Maze' was nothing other than an extremely tired 'group of explorers wander around a forest and battle some evil Kings' pseudo-Slayers knockoff.
Maze has odd moments of gratuitous female nudity (presumably the ""fan service"" euphemistically referred to so often), a bit of mecha, and a bit of attempted self-reverential comedy where the group are quizzed on the identities and activities of the various publishers and producers of the Maze series. But it just doesn't pull any of it off.
The lead character, Maze, just isn't interesting. Okay, when night falls she turns into a repellent, slobbering man. Is that it? It's not even slightly funny or likeable, (unlike, say, Carrot Glace in Sorcerer Hunters)
I kept waiting for this anime to get started. It didn't. I kept waiting for the moment when I'd be interested. I wasn't. And now I'm struggling to think of one good thing to say about Maze. And I can't. I own and admire a lot of anime series but I genuinely cannot see one redeeming feature or anything that's remotely likeable in this one. An utter, utter waste of time.",973555200,14,1143,4.748743718592965
196387,5,1578004306,"Maze is a young woman whos' house falls through time and space into a world on the brink of being conquered by an evil kingdom called Jina, Maze meats a young princess named mill who can summon a giant mecha or ""demi armor"". Maze soon learns that who voyage has given her great powers through magic known as ""phantom light"" later she meets up with a wise man and 3 warriors, a man and 2 women(one of whom is a lesbian :-),oh and did I mention that by night maze turns into a lechorous man with no shame what-so-ever. Over all I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys Anime and doesn't mind scene after scene of gratuitist nudity.",973296000,5,631,4.310924369747899
196388,4,1578004306,"This is fantastic! It had me laughing out loud at their comedic antics including some gender-bending confusion not dissimilar to Ranma 1/2. My  only complaint was that it's too short! I want to see more! At least though  the main story is wrapped up in that time. the animation is very well done  & the action is a fluid pleasure to watch. Well paced comedy mixed with  action that was thoroughly enjoyable.  The subtitles were well done (timing  good & print clear, easy to read) & so was the dubbing which fit  the characters very well in my opinion. The bonus first episode of the  television series was a great addition & also fun viewing that added  more background information. It definitely leaves you wanting to watch  more. With the intriguing places & even more interesting characters  it's easily one of my new favourites as well as being addictive!",969148800,8,860,4.704697986577181
196389,4,1578004306,"First this is a very funny 13UP video.  Preview for your younger teenagers, Strong Language, Violence, Adult situations, and nudity to name  my concerns.
Katsumi Hasegawa was a screenwriter for ""Slayers,  Next"" and the Humor and pace of ""Maze"" is very similar.  There is many in-jokes  through out the video.
The story evolves around  the title character ""Maze"" who by day is a sweet, caring young  woman with amazing powers that combine with  Princess Mill to create a  sorcerous mecha. But at night Maze turns into a lecherous young man.  To  put a scale to the lechery, if Ataru Moroboshi and Carrot Glaze were  puppies then the male Maze is a rabid wolervine!
Still the two young  women have gathered together quite a team, most of whom have a crush on  Maze's female side.  With their help they are running away from Mill's  homeland one step ahead of an evil warrior cult!
  The intro by  Princess Mill was more like a recap of the previous episode. Makes me feel  like I jumped into the middle of the series without the character  development in most anime series!",966124800,,1071,4.650537634408602
196390,4,1578004306,"When I first watched this Series back in 1996, it often reminded me of Ranma 1/2. The series centers around Maze, a  quiet girl who suddenly discovers her self in a strange world, and losted all her memory. She then  meet up with the ""cute princess""(of course), and tries to flee  from the monsters and evil monkeys ^_^. As their journey of escape goes on,  Maze discovers that she suddenly turns into a wild lustful guy at night.  And the princess falls in love with Maze(both male and female), and created  the new term Oneni-sama(beloved sisbrother). Since it's created from the  same writters as a Slayers, you can often see some resemble of Slayers. The  major attraction of the series is the mecha battles and the unique  personallity of each of the chareacters. The voice actors of this series is  also one of the greatest group you'll see in years(besides EVA). If you  don't mind lesbians, sexsual jokes, and some close-to-hentai scenes(girl  +tentacles...). I would recomond you to buy this tape, especially in Sub.  P.S. Wonderful ending song",962409600,,1053,4.848314606741573
196391,4,1578004306,"Hey, I am a newbie to anime and all I can say is if this is and example of what is out there I am going to buy more! The storyline is thoughtful and very interesting, the characters are well drawn, and it is one of those  titles that scream, ""BUY ME!"" The animation is good for the  production cost and the the subbing is OK but it seems to be edited. That,  however, is one thing you will never know. Maze is defenately an adult  video. It has lesbians, heavy sex, lots of profanity, and a good amount of  nudity. Still, it is a great title and deserves plenty of viewing.  Luckilly, they keep hinting this isn't going to be the first and last  volume so I am exicted!",961372800,,669,4.1
196392,5,1578004306,"This series is great!  It can be a little on the wierd side at times, but it is SOOO funny!  ^_^  I LOVE the ending song: ""Junk Boy""! (singing to self...) *Don't touch, Junk boy, DAMEDAME lonely boy...* ^_^v",961027200,,207,4.256410256410256
7799071,4,1578004306,"I had looked into Maze before buying this and it met every expectation I had. There was a scene in my copy where a few frames didn't work, but other than that I loved it!",1488844800,,170,3.8857142857142857
7799072,3,1578004306,"It's funny but it dosen't have a lot to do with the series itself. It's somewhat sexual, but that's my kind of humor. It's also more or less softcore pornography mostly of women. Maze TV is much less preverse, although it also has many sexual themes.",1243641600,,250,4.456521739130435
7799073,5,1578004306,"it says it has a 13+ rating? I am 16 and I don't think 13 ear olds should even watch this, it's full of very naughty things, but it was very entertaining!",1238803200,,154,3.84375
7799074,1,1578004306,"Don't get me wrong, I love anime.  I love most of Japanese culture...but DVDs like the MAZE OAV make me glad that I'm as far away from there as possible, assuming the creators live there as opposed to living with Jimmy Hoffa and the aliens on the planet Zarkon.  I had seen (and reviewed) the original Maze TV series, but one good thing about TV; you have to have standards.  ..., Maze tries to mix a D&D type fantasy with a sexual comedy.  Let me expound upon that by saying that the results are at best tragic, and at worst horrific.  I don't care about things like ""cultural differences"", scenes like where man Maze decides to pointlessly rape this princess named Mix, only to turn out that, yes, she enjoyed it, should not even exist, yet alone being presented for my viewing enjoyment.  Pretty much, this is the version of ""Maze"" that takes the gloves off of the series, showing what I'm sure the ... creator originally had in mind, but couldn't show, even on Japanese TV.  Delightfully flat characters and pointless scenes ahoy!  Would recommend as an alternative to ""cruel and unusual punishment"", or for use as a frisbee for a REALLY small dog.  Avoid this if you ever want to ""like"" anything again.",1028851200,8,1207,4.576744186046511
7799075,1,1578004306,"Could only watch the first few minutes before going into 8x fast forward and it still was moving too slow!  This one looks like it targets an audience of about the 3rd to 5th grade level in Japan.  Animation is very poor (very little movement, very choppy), the dialog is incredibly simple, the situations and story are very standard, and the dub is awful!  Very young children may not know better and may enjoy it, but there are some deliberate overtones of sexuality and pre-pubescent female emfatuation that might make this not a dvd to recommend to parents.  Enjoy Slayers for better execution of the magic and fantasy theme on an adult level or Escaflowne for serious entertainment for adults or teens.",1008374400,5,707,4.770491803278689
7799076,3,1578004306,"I wasn't expecting too much from this anime, so I came in with an open mind.  For the Maze series, the OAV's came before the TV series and thus with the OAV, you see situations that are more for adults and the TV series, things are toned down for the children who come home in the afternoons in Japan.
With that out of the way, the series was interesting and it did keep my interest.  It's not a superb anime but it was entertaining.  The anime though is not as sharp as other OAV's that came out during the mid or late 90's.  It seemed like TV quality OAV's.
As for the DVD, special features include the first episode of the series (is this a special feature?) and a ""meet the cast"" which is nothing and the trailers which are from Hasegawa Katsumi's (screenwriter) other works.
Perhaps if I had a DVD-Rom, I would say more positive things but at this time, if you can rent it...rent it.  It is a good anime but again...nothing great.",1002931200,5,935,4.2897727272727275
7799077,4,1578004306,If you don't mind lots of nudity and fan service in your anime this is the right one for you.  This movie is really more of a teaser to the television series.  Something more to wet your appetite than anything else.  The characters are already developed and their special skills already learned.  On the other hand the comedy is out there.  They make so much fun of themselves it's ridiculous.  Lots of fun!!,997488000,,408,4.52054794520548
7799078,1,1578004306,"Ok, before you even think of buying this tape read the back, PLEASE. It's all about Maze, a girl who transforms into a guy a night. Maze has friends that help her fight Gorgeous, some evil guy. Male maze has some fun with Mixx, the king's daughter. They save the day. Everyone's happy. Blah blah blah blah blah blah-OH PLEASE! This is just a disgusting competitor of the wonderful Ranma 1/2 series. I was too ashamed to put this with the rest of my anime collection. Please by all costs - AVOID MAZE! If you want to watch some excellent anime series, I reccomend Evangelion, Ranma 1/2, Nadesico, and Original Dirty Pair.",995500800,5,620,4.544642857142857
