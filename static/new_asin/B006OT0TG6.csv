5011104,1,B006OT0TG6,"THE HELLCATS is one more cinematic version of what an outlaw biker gang is like. As usual, the characters are ludicrous, the biker slang is absurd, and worst of all, the whole mess is downright boring!  I mean, if any movie genre needs sex and violence, it's the biker film! Instead, we get a lot of tough, obscenity-free talk, and little action. They do drink gallons of beer, and are supposed to be drug smugglers, but they're a pretty un-frightening bunch of coconuts. The final showdown between the HELLCATS and the mob is pure comic genius! Dumb, dumber, dumbest... P.S.- The soundtrack is groovy, especially the limp title song by Davy Jones and the Dolphins!...",1362355200,2,668,4.808695652173913
5011105,1,B006OT0TG6,"Normally, I'd go into a nice little paragraph which sets up my thoughts of the film, followed by a quick synopsis of the plot, my thoughts of the various attributes of the film (acting, directing, cinematography, etc.) and close with a pithy little nugget that sums up my overall feelings.

I can't do that with ""The Hellcats,"" because I still have no idea what I just saw. It certainly wasn't a coherent movie. There was no discernible plot to be found here. No interesting performances, no dramatic tension, nothing you would except to see when watching a film. As far as I could tell, it's basically a film that throws together every stereotypical biker clich&eacute; in the book and tries to let a story unfold from that. And it epically fails.

I know dropping acid and smoking weed was the hip thing going in the late 60's. It is pretty obvious that almost anyone involved with this venture was using them before, during, and after production. Maybe if I'd have done so before watching this... spectacle, I might have been able to understand it. Regardless, it had the same effect on me any illegal narcotics could: It warped my perceptions of logic and reality, killed off a large number of brain cells, and when I awoke from the stupor it put me in, I couldn't have told you what time of day it is. Avoid this crap pile like the plague it is! I wish I had. It's probably THE worst film I've ever seen (and given some of the ones I have, that's saying something)!",1345075200,,1470,4.522556390977444
8502247,1,B006OT0TG6,"I expected this to be a really bad B-movie, but it was worse than that. I saw it on prime and it still cost too much. Negative five stars.",1486080000,,138,3.793103448275862

8502249,5,B006OT0TG6,"In this movie, it's another motorcycle-crazy sixties youth-oriented trashy scene. In other words, it's just what the doctor ordered for a day when my bike is in the shop and I feel low. Good for the soul. If you like old biker movies, Ross Hagen and company will satisfy you.",1475884800,,275,4.52
8502250,1,B006OT0TG6,"A biker group is used to deal drugs from Mexico. An undercover agent is shot and his military returning brother, Monte (Ross Hagen) infiltrates the group according to the formula. Also his brother's fiancee infiltrates too. Monte makes out with all the girls to get information...I think that is what they were doing as those scenes were always covered in a blanket. We don't want to offend the eyes of the other bikers.

As for the DVD cover...Now there a woman with an eye patch who Monte lovingly called ""cyclops"" and her response was ""What's a cyclops?"" Clearly a victim of the public schools. Now I don't recall her or any other women swinging a chain, although one did take off her belt and used it like a whip...oops that was near the end, sorry for the plot spoiler as if you are going to actually watch this stinker.

Guide: No swearing sex or nudity in this biker film. Available on multi-packs.",1472774400,2,905,4.580246913580247
