1830845,5,B00008979U,"Simply put this is the baddest Gospel DVD on record.  Fred Hammond and his annointed singers, musicians, and technicians have done it again and better than the last time.  At 130 minutes of DVD concert you'D think that it is a long DVD but trust me, you will be wanting more when its over.  I had to have an extra copy of it so I could bless my Pastor with it.  This is a praise and worship service that you will be blessed to participate in.  You can also see throughout the recording how the people are moved by the music and how ""down"" Mr. Hammond is.  My ONLY disappointment was, as a bass player myself, Fred didn't pick up his axe and get down like he did in the opening of his last one.  BUT, Maurice Fitzgerald, Fred's current concert bass player brings it like only he can.  This DVD is just straight up ANNOINTED!",1048982400,11,823,4.230769230769231
1830846,5,B00008979U,"Whew! Man this DVD is smoking. I mean literally. I've played it so much my DVD player started smoking. Nah, just kidding. This DVD is just the Bizzomb, simply put. For those of you who don't like some of the songs on the CD, buy the DVD. You'll see these songs in a whole new perspective. What you'll probably do is record the DVD to cassette so that you can listen to it in the car. It's that good! Man, I always have and I always will love Fred Hammond's music. This is my favorite artists by far. The man plays, composes, produces, arranges, sings and does it all to the glory of God and the upbuilding of His Kingdom. This DVD had me listening to songs that I didn't even like. The atmosphere was straight up MTV unplugged. The band of course was doing it's THANG!!! The look on Daniel Witherspoon's face while they were playing ""That Ain't Nothing"" (SMOKING!!!!!) says it all. At the end of ""You Are My Life"" they do a rendition of ""Total Praise"" by Richard Smallwood and it works to perfection. You could feel the spirit moving through the building. I really didn't like the song ""Great"" on the album, but when the band started playing the song, I had to crank up the volume. It was tight! As I said before, there are some songs on the CD that I constantly fast-forward. However, the DVD doesn't allow me to do that, because the atmosphere and experience is so authentic. There's even bonus features and behind-the-scenes looks into Fred's personal life and how he prepares for concerts. If you can't say anything else about Fred, you have to admit that his songs are heartfelt melodies. Nobody in the Gospel industry writes a ballad like Fred Hammond. His lyrics are heartfelt and so inspired by God that it just ministers to you in a special way. Keep doing what you are doing Fred. This DVD will not disappoint even the most critical of fans. All the banging beats and tight music kind of reminded me of the Commission Reunion tour. All the while, Fred is ministering to the hearts of men and women through song. Fred is sick man...real sick. Be Blessed",1048636800,,2062,4.472148541114058
1830847,5,B00008979U,"I can't get enough of this DVD.  If you can wear a DVD out in a few days, then I think I have.  It's great to see Fred at his finest.  The Christ-filled, God soaked, anointed words in this DVD, (as well as the CD), are just blessed from the most High One.  The behind the scenes look at the concert preparations makes me believe that we can be ""in the world"", but not in it.  I highly recommend this DVD to any one who enjoys Gospel music!  As a black American living in Sydney, I know you can't get this kind of Gospel here.  I'll be sharing this DVD with my fellow ""Aussie mates"" so they can see how it's done.  I am truly blessed by this DVD.  I give it a 20 out of 10!!!  Thank you Jesus for Brotha Fred and Company!!!",1048550400,,722,3.9172413793103447
1830848,5,B00008979U,A wonderderful praise and worship experience.  The Lord is truly speaking through him to bring forth His words and desires for His people.  You will be blessed tremendously.

1830850,5,B00008979U,Yes this dvd is great. the band is magnificent.. and the music is beautiful and powerful all at the same time. but I wish this video was more like the purpose by design one which had more of a continuous medley of songs in a row. but in the end it doesn't matter.

1830871,3,B00008979U,"I love Fred Hammond and all of the POL, but CD is lacking in sound quality.  The music itself is awesome, but I already had the DVD and was expecting the same quality of sound, but this one is lacking.  If you use stereo headphones, it's somewhat better.  Please let me be clear in that the sound quality is of no reflection to the songs on the CD, yes Fred has, as always, delivered some of the best gospel music ever on this work.  My only issue is because of the poor sound quality, I couldn't enjoy this awesome music at its best.",1359763200,,534,4.155339805825243
1830872,5,B00008979U,Classic Fred Hammond and Fam! Looking forward to more! Awesome move of God and my He continue to bless the ministry.,1357344000,,116,4.571428571428571
1830873,5,B00008979U,What can I say?? Fred Hammond is an icon of RnB gospel music and this album is right up there in my books as one of his best! Having initially misplaced my first DVD I was stoked to find it here on Amazon as it is no longer sold here in NZ. The next best thing would be for Fred Hammond to come down to NZ to perform live! Keep on groovin' Fred Hammond!!,1258329600,,354,3.7972972972972974
1830874,5,B00008979U,Quel DVD...Quel son...Quels musiciens...Quels Choeurs...Quel Chanteur...C'est du pure bonheur! Merci MR FRED HAMMOND & THE RADICAL FOR CHRIST....,1194566400,,145,7.111111111111111
1830875,5,B00008979U,"This project is blessed.  I can worship with this one.  Our Youth Band did that arrangement for ""That Ain't Nothin'"" and got second place in a national competition.",1193702400,,164,4.821428571428571
1830876,5,B00008979U,"Fred is an artist to say the least.  This DVD is a must for everyone who wants good gospel with real lyrics.  I put it in the player, turn it up and my entire household loves it tremendously!",1186531200,,191,4.0
1830877,5,B00008979U,"Once again, Fred Hammond has met his goal of sharing his spirituality.  This is an excellent dvd.",1156377600,,97,4.705882352941177
1830878,5,B00008979U,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this DVD? It is truly an anointed concert. From uptempo praise to smooth, heart-felt worship, this DVD has it ALL. My 13 month old son LOVES it. Anytime we go to put something in the dvd player, you can tell he's looking for Fred. And if it's something else, he walks away. But when we put Fred on, he sits still (an obvious miracle from God! LOL!), smiles, claps, laughs, and just enjoys himself.

On a more serious note, though, the lyrics are outstanding. They express how we who love God truly feel about Him. The lyrics express passion and the general longing for God that believers share. The lyrics are also ""word-based,"" so you are actually being fed spiritually while you enjoy these WONDERFUL songs given to Fred by the Creator Himself. You sense the anointing in each song...the crowd is pumped, the performers are professional and on point, and everyone is having a good time in God. Who says praise and worship is boring? EVERYBODY I show this video to LOVES it. I can't say enough about it.

Fred also takes a few moments between each song to introduce the members of his band, so that you feel like you are getting to know the performers personally as well, because we all have stories, don't we?

DO NOT hesitate to get this DVD. It is truly a blessing. We listen to it AT LEAST once a day.... my son wouldn't have it any other way. Praise God for this one...It's a keeper! Be blessed.",1144800000,,1452,4.451127819548872
1830879,5,B00008979U,"This is one amazing concert/worship service. Fred is truly in his element, and his group is amazingly tight vocally and instrumentally.  I have watched this about twice a day since i got it a week ago.  My instant favorites were ""song of strength"" and ""Your everything to me""  These had the most inspiring worshipful moments.  When they get to the ""Hold on"" part, hold on. It was also nice to hear Fred talk about the songs, I feel like I understand him much better now and can appreciate his lyrics. As a musician I enjoy the behind the scenes stuff like rehearsals. (spec. feat)",1127001600,2,580,4.548076923076923
1830880,5,B00008979U,It's that good.  Really.  I've watched this anointed performance at least 200 times.  I love Fred and his ministry.  God has blessed his music - Fred is a true latter day psalmist!,1121126400,4,180,4.53125
1830881,5,B00008979U,"Fred Hammond comes through (as usual) with an incredible, uplifting praise experience.  You cannot sit down while watching this DVD.  Turn out the lights, turn up the music and prepare to enter into God's presence!  No one does it better than Fred Hammond (and this is coming from a small-town white girl!)",1111881600,2,306,4.846153846153846
1830882,5,B00008979U,This is an awesome praise and worship experience. The anointing of God was present in this. It led me into praise and worship. I highly recommend this it will not dissappoint.,1105574400,2,175,4.67741935483871
1830883,5,B00008979U,"Once again FRED shows why he is the man. The spirit of GOD is all over him. The songs are slammin',and the band is stupid.(Big TOM)what up? Keep it up man. PEACE!",1061856000,3,162,4.09375
1830884,5,B00008979U,"WOW!!
I must concur with all the ratings on this Concert, its in a class all its own.
Intimate and Passionate...
I had the privilege of seeing Fred & his band at the Impact Conference in Dec of 2002, and it was simply an amazing experience.
Fred Hammond and RFC are the most underrated Acts in Gospel today. 10 or 20 yrs from now, they will be honored as Bonafide Legends of not only Gospel, but music in general.
Anyone yearning for First-Class Praise & Worship, in addition to First-Class musicianship....do yourself a favor, CHECK OUT THIS DVD/VIDEO
FRED FANS, GET IT!!! (as well as the CD)",1061683200,4,593,4.5514018691588785
1830885,5,B00008979U,"Oh my goodness!  Fred Hammond & RFC, by far are one of the best Gospel groups in the industry.  I've loved Fred Hammond's music ever since I was a little child when Commissioned hit the scene back in the late 80s.  This LIVE performance takes the music from his CD ""POL Chapter 3"" and completely turns it inside out.  From the angelic harmony of RFC to the magnificent arrangements of the Live band, to just the way Jesus and His angels truly appear to be in the midst of the congregation, you WILL NOT be disappointed with this DVD purchase.  If you are a Fred Hammond fan or even if you're not, this is definitely a MUST SEE!",1060646400,4,627,4.279661016949152
1830886,5,B00008979U,"I am not the type to normally enjoy watching a DVD of gospel music...it really sounded boring to me before I started watching it.  I can only tell you it was one of the greatest blessings I have received from Fred Hammond's ministeries (and that is saying something).  Hearing Fred's perspectives and his life experiences behind songs like ""Praise Him Through The Night"" and ""Hold On and Wait"" it was just an unspeakable benefit.
Not to mention the songs sound different on the DVD, the songs that I thought were mediocre on the CD but with awesome lyrics were completely different. The live sound was off the chain. I wish I had a copy of this on CD. Don't sleep on it.",1058745600,,670,4.483606557377049
1830887,5,B00008979U,My brothers and sisters I implore you to purchase this cd and support this dude Fred Hammond. He has blessed me with his music as far back as I can remember. If you are a worshiper this CD is for you. As a singer and musician i have been inspired by his musicians ( especially the bass player Maurice)and RFC. Oh yeah! Shea Norman is awesome too ya'll. It's just a blessing simply put.,1048982400,2,385,4.216216216216216
