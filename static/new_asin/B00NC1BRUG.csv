6637930,5,B00NC1BRUG,Jaime is amazing! Our little one has been doing Cosmic Kids Yoga for over a year now and still loves it. I couldn't be more satisfied with this product. It's fun for adults and older siblings to join in too.,1452643200,2,207,4.2

6637933,5,B00NC1BRUG,"I love this video.  I purchased this on and the series 1 DVD for 7 year old twin granddaughters.  What a hit!  The instructor is awsome, interesting, and really speaks to children.  Such an easy listen.  The girls were glued instantly.  They have never been introduced to yoga, but you would have never guessed it.  They looked like pros right off the bat as they followed instruction.  Don't hesitate, the seller is great, Amazon is always A-1, and the DVD itself is excellent.",1428278400,,478,4.674698795180723
6637934,1,B00NC1BRUG,Very disappointed in this defective product. There are supposed to be 3 yoga stories but the second one cuts out after 3 min so there are only 2 that work properly. Looking into options to refund but it will cost me what the dvd cost to send back. Pretty upset and disappointed!!,1427587200,,279,4.384615384615385

8677309,3,B00NC1BRUG,"This is a cute DVD with a total of 3 yoga videos.  Each is roughly 10-15 min long, which I find a decent length for bedtime (long enough to help the settle process start, not long enough to bore them).  However, each pose is held for 3-5 seconds, with 5 being the exception.  3 seconds is really the average.  My kids, who aren't really yogi's but have done and do appreciate yoga at ages 7 & 5, were annoyed that they weren't holding the poses long enough to actually stretch.  Dad and mom were joining in, and even more annoyed because we legitimately needed the stretches.  Because she moved so quickly from pose to pose it really just promoted more sillies vs getting my kids in the bedtime mindset.",1483920000,,703,4.410852713178294

8677311,4,B00NC1BRUG,"Love Twighlight the unicorn episode! Tommy the turtle had some awkward/weird poses/moves, so we're sticking with Twighlight for now. We have not done the third episode yet on this bedtime yoga DVD, but Jaime is a great personality for kids yoga!
My 5 year old daughter loves doing bedtime yoga with mommy, especially when she's got too much high energy and needs to channel it.
Her 2 year old little brother will sometimes do this yoga DVD with her, and that's adorable!
Her 4 year old cousin has done it too, one night when family was over and the kids were just so excited about everything going on. It helped them focus their energies on calming.
I just wish Jaime would talk more about breathing with each pose, and when to inhale/exhale slowly and deeply. I end up doing it with the kids to instruct their breathing.

8677312,5,B00NC1BRUG,Purchased for my five year old son.  This holds his attention and he is excited to do bedtime yoga each night!  The dvd comes with 3 bedtime stories and is a good length for each work out.,1474934400,3,188,4.054054054054054

wonderful series and exploration perfect for my child and the whole family to relax.",1467849600,,163,4.620689655172414
8677314,5,B00NC1BRUG,We love everything about Cosmic Kids yoga. Can't say enough. We use the online content and have these for travel purposes and because we want to help support this company to keep them doing what they do. It is engaging for the little one and gets the introduction to yoga going with such fun and light-hearted content. Love all of the various themes. Our little one asks for it all the time. And it is so good to start this healthy habit young. I think this is just one of the best products I've seen for kids. I'm not a fan of much screen time for kids but this is worth it. I'd give it a million stars if I could. Absolutely love the whole series.,1467072000,,649,4.158730158730159
