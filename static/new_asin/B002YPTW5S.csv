4013837,5,B002YPTW5S,"I'll never forget when, at 15 years old, I saw Jack Nicklaus play in the Los Angeles Open.  He wasn't very popular in those days and so you could get really close to watch him when he teed off.  I never saw anyone hit he ball higher, farther, or louder.  That's right.  With those persimmon club heads,  his tee shot was like a bomb going off.  Sam Snead was no slouch either.  Snead was a great favorite of my father, who went to see him at a U.S. Open back in the 1940's.  Snead was a great athlete who combined touch, strength, ease and endurance.  He remained competitive long after his early contemporaries had retired and into the new generation of golfers like Palmer and Nicklaus.  Oh, and this was a great golf match between two very competitive players:  the established champion versus the up and coming champion.",1376438400,2,824,4.5

4013839,3,B002YPTW5S,Best they can do with video transfer. Good match though ; for golf nuts who like me are deciding the skill level of the new kids.,1358899200,,129,4.0
4013840,5,B002YPTW5S,"I love the old ""Shell"" matches, and this is definitely one of the best that I've seen. I'm a fan of both players and this match didn't disappoint. Watching two of the game's greatest players going head to head on arguably one of golf's finest courses (Pebble Beach) was a real treat. Snead was past his prime at this time, but his swing is as sweet as always, and he displayed some fantastic short game skill in the match. Jack was only 23 when this match was filmed, and you can clearly see why he was considered to be the next big star in golf, and undoubtedly one of the longest, straightest drivers of his time. This match is definitely a classic. I only wish more of the matches were available on DVD. I'd definitely add to my collection.",1341100800,,743,4.35251798561151
4013841,5,B002YPTW5S,Great to finally be able to see this historic match on DVD... very interesting to see how much Pebble Beach has changed since 1963... And to watch Nicklaus at the start of his majestical career is awesome... The bonus footage is a nice addition... If you are a golf fan you will like this DVD.,1294099200,,293,4.345454545454546

8384379,3,B002YPTW5S,"it's just ok.  the broadcast only shows you certain holes, and not the entire round of golf.  it's good to own however, for historical purposes.",1410739200,,144,4.72
8384380,5,B002YPTW5S,"What an awesome video. I love this classic stuff. I learn so much from it. The video is very clear, and the DVD plays so nicely, that you can freeze-frame on pause, and move frame-by-frame so that you can really see the swings in detail. Nice.",1404950400,,243,4.304347826086956
8384381,5,B002YPTW5S,"I wish Shell would bring back a series like this. It's like opening a time capsule.

Sorry, I needed 4 more words to complete the review. Hell, it's good, worth the price -- what more can you say?",1376611200,,196,4.157894736842105
