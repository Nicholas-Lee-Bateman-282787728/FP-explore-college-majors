8687314,4,B00PBGP5J4,"As usual some stories are better than others, but overall a fun watch.

In my opinion the best segments are: Tainted Blood (about vampires) and Scent of the Sasquatch (hikers encounter sasquatch).

The funniest segment was: Beetlemaniac about a perky young woman getting ready to meet her blind date. This segment stars Isabelle Stephen and Luc Bernier who probably are the best known actors to be featured in this anthology.

There are several topless gals, enough kills and some nicely done monster/creature effects. Recommended to fans on no-budget Horror movies.",1426809600,,566,5.266666666666667
