8090955,4,B000BQ7JX4,"This movie is in Italian on a region 2 DVD.  I was curious about it because Mathilda May is in it.  Mathilda May played an alien energy vampire in the movie Lifeforce.  Entertaining, although I don't understand Italian, and there are no English subtitles.",1388880000,,255,4.75
8090956,5,B000BQ7JX4,"Wow.  Life is really very simple.  This movie condenses human life into three stages: 1) the need for food (milk from the breast); 2)the need for sex (motivated  by LOVE); and 3) the need for companionship (which for practical purposes ties all three needs together).  Oversimplified of course.  But ""La Teta y la Luna"" shows this beautifully!  The young boy having the simple need to have a breast of his own; the driven young man to have the woman of his desires; and the realistic compromises of an older man to have the simple companship of a woman he wants to posess for his own.  Highly recommend for a study of human nature.",1254700800,4,631,4.530973451327434

*The story that follows is hilarious. The ending will have you in tears. I refuse to be like another reviewer who is a scene spoiler; you're going to have to watch this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this outstanding movie. I will stake my reputation by stating that you will not regret purchasing this video.",1212192000,5,499,4.555555555555555
8090958,5,B000BQ7JX4,"Very amusing and ribald.  It would never be produced in Hollywood!  Mathilda May Is charming in the innocent but sexy role she plays.  Perhaps this is not for the prim and proper folks, but others will love it.",1203724800,2,210,4.473684210526316
8090959,4,B000BQ7JX4,"I have bought a copy of this DVD film/movie and have watched. This DVD film/movie basically talks about how ages of different people during their early days become interested in woman whom have a fiancee. This is another great work by JJ Bigas Luna apart from another good work that is Ages of LULU which is from the director himself. I have seen another great director's work which is from Larry Clark and what I can say is great and the titles of these films are Ken Park, Bully, Kids and Another Day in Paradise. This DVD film/movie La Teta Y La Luna is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film/movie.

8090960,5,B000BQ7JX4,"'La Teta y la Luna' is a light-hearted and sensual story of a little nine year old boy named Tete (Biel Duran) who wants to be treated the same as his newborn baby brother. Unable to get his Mother's attention and affection away from her new bundle of joy, Tete decides to go in search of a surrogate Mother.

Tete asks the moon to provide him with a loving female. When a beautiful French dancer (Mathilda May) and her husband arrive in town Tete is certain she's the one he's been looking for. However convincing her won't be easy, not only does he have to deal with her husband, but another local teenager is also in hot pursuit of the enticing Estrellita.

This is definitely not for the prudish, or easily offended. There is quite a bit of frontal nudity in this film. However if you're open-minded and have a good understanding of European humor you will appreciate this erotic little comedy as much as I did. By the way, Mathilda May is absolutely ravishing, I don't know if I've ever seen a more beautiful woman in any film!",1143504000,14,1032,4.455026455026455
