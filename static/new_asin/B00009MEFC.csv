7991899,4,B00009MEFC,"Wing Hauser introduces himself into the movie while on a phone line of ill repute. In fact, it seems to be a running theme in later Wings Hauser stuff. The 900 numbers just had a certain interest to him. It's not a bad thing cause it is hilarious and impressively gutsy to introduce yourself in your own movie in such a sleazy light. It's pure Wings Hauser.

The movie is actually about 2 young cops who want to bust a drug dealer and this leads to lots and lots of people getting shot. Wings is directing the movie and that means that he directs everyone to act like Wings. Everyone is up to the task and maybe trying to out do him misguided ways. One of the cops goes undercover as a white Rasta enthusiast type and gives a performance that no doubt inspired an aging George Lucas to create Jar Jar Binks. It's hilarious needless to say.

At one point in the movie Wings literally asks ""Who's gonna pat me on the butt?"" It kinda sums up this movie. It's a little weird, eager to please, and wants to be liked but doesn't know when it is actually likeable. It makes it a great watch. It's like someone's home movie version of Miami Vice but way more ambitious. Better than any season of True Detective...or at least the episodes with Lilly Collins and Alexandra Daddario.",1469145600,,1272,4.385593220338983

because I haved always enjoyed Wings Hauser playing a tough guy cop in these
low budget crime dramas. Hauser directs this film and is listed as the star
but he is barely in the movie. The two male leads act like low rent rejects
from Miama Vice. If you like action flicks or are a Hauser fan look to his
other films. This movie is just not very good.",1288224000,,424,4.059523809523809
