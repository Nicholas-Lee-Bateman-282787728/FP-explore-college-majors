7154578,2,B00WUVRM26,"The title is a bit misleading. There isn't really a haunted ship like one would expect from a film like ""Ghost Ship"" but a haunted person who sees things on a ship. Samantha (Jennifer Stuckert) has been recently acquitted of murdering her family. She goes on a boat trip with her friends and boyfriend Mark (Brian Rife) a ""good looking loser."" There are not a lot of characters. He see her foster sister (Melissa Quine) and another doctor colleague (Kari Wishingrad) who I nominate as the film's worst actor.

Now the whole gist of the story centers around Sam's recovered memory. She has memory flashbacks while trapped on a boat  for what seemed like 3 days in the harbor playing ""Operation"" on herself.

The film was on the boring side as we wait for a clue or something significant to happen. And when it does, it is a let down. The film doesn't explain itself, but shows you enough that you can sort of figure things out for yourself. High boredom factor.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.  Minor blood. Does not show gore.",1445040000,3,1031,4.581521739130435

7154580,5,B00WUVRM26,Ross Turner was good in it. Maybe a sequel with just him.,1485388800,,57,3.8333333333333335
7154581,2,B00WUVRM26,Not scary at all very predictable,1485129600,,33,4.666666666666667
7154582,3,B00WUVRM26,"A cousin thrice removed from the brilliant TRIANGLE, the script/narrative of GB was really a mess. But Ms. Stucker's work, assured direction ((pretty ironic given that the director wrote the thing!), and the encroaching creep factor concerning the situation ultimately warranted the third star.",1484697600,2,294,5.704545454545454

7154587,1,B00WUVRM26,This movie is a constant series of flashbacks...could not make sense of it.,1484352000,,75,4.846153846153846
7154588,2,B00WUVRM26,This movie started out ok but quickly became confusing.  I watched until the end but still couldn't make sense of it.,1484265600,4,117,4.571428571428571
8714406,1,B00WUVRM26,"I mean, it had good make-up effects. Seriously, I mean that. But the story was horribly paced, and the ending was so WTF I couldn't stop shaking my head and just -staring- at it.",1518912000,,178,4.264705882352941
8714407,1,B00WUVRM26,"waste of time, forget it.  Makes no sense....",1511654400,,45,4.625
8714408,2,B00WUVRM26,I gave it two because the acting was good.  Story had potential and concept wasn't original BUT it too could have produced an entertaining movie.  Editing horrible.  Its almost like multiple people were trying to do a movie without seeing what the others did.  Everyone was right who stated: it made NO sense.  A waste of good actors. I did watch the whole the whole thing though.  I wanted to know how it would conclude.  It totally blew up then.,1509148800,,447,4.5125

8714411,3,B00WUVRM26,"This movie is very disconnected.  The basic idea is good, but the two 'evil' entity's didn't seem to connect with the subject or victim in my view.  I did fast forward so maybe I skipped over it, but I doubt it.  I didn't mind the flash backs and figured out 'who' did it very early-seemed obvious- and the ending seemed good or fitting but because it conflicted with the middle and what happened during those scenes it made the whole movie disconnected.",1496448000,,454,4.512195121951219
