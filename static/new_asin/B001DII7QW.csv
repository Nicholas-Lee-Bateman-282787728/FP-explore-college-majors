8293465,5,B001DII7QW,"I'm rating this high because I think it's one of the best skateboarding video's ever. I'd already seen it before buying it and I wanted it for years before i actually purchased it.

The video is extremely well put together. Tracklist consists of classic rock.

The last part contains Sean Malto's footy from 2007 when he got awarded AM of the year. Skating is top notch, camera angles are awesome and editing is perfect. Maybe my favorite part ever including Sean Malto's resent part in Girl - Pretty Sweet.

I recommend this video for anyone in search of a good skateboarding video!",1367798400,,583,4.696078431372549
