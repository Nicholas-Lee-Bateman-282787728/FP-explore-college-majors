8728753,5,B013TOIV4A,"I love the old Blondie and Dagwood movies.  I bought this for sentimental reasons and it did not disappoint.  When I was only ten years old my Air Force father was transferred to Clark AFB in the Philippines.  On Saturday nights the Armed Forces TV and Radio Network played one of these movies every Saturday night.  My mom and I would pop some popcorn and sit back and watch one of these movies.  She's gone now but I still enjoy watching these with my own daughters.  So funny, not dirty at all, and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  The shipping was fast and I received the product as described.",1529366400,,607,4.366071428571429
