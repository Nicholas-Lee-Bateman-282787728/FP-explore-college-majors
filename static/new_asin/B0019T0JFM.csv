3443541,5,B0019T0JFM,"Al igual que la segunda parte (""La leyenda de La Llorona""), mi hija no para de ver estas peliculas, sobre todo por que se identifica culturamente con el lenguaje, el humor y las costumbres, en una produccin de primer nivel...

Muy recomendable!!, y esperaremos la tercera parte!... (Las Momias de Guanajuato)...",1355788800,2,311,5.098039215686274

3443548,2,B0019T0JFM,"Similar to Monster House, but the story line is lacking.  I bought it for my Spanish classes hoping it would be entertaining and educational.  The audio is horrible, and if you much of the cultural references/comedy may be missed by non-Hispanic students.  A waste of hard-earned money. :o(",1400716800,,290,5.0

The movie is really funny and my daughter loves it, describes and gives a pretty good idea of how this legend was generated in Mexico.

You can tell it was their first movie, the quality of the cartoons is not as good as in La leyenda de la Llorona but still a fun movie and the price is reasonable so it makes it worth having both movies.",1362182400,,466,4.284090909090909
3443556,4,B0019T0JFM,"The plot isn't as action-packed as ""Llorona"" nor as familiar.  It's an interesting story, but difficult for intermediate learners to watch.",1358726400,2,139,5.619047619047619

8275215,5,B0019T0JFM,"I absolutely love this animated film. While the quality is not that of a disney production, this film was made with passion. The music is great, so find the soundtrack. The version I received has a reworked scene of the Medico Brujo song performance, which I disliked (the original is much more entertaining). Xochitl is my favorite character, but there are a ton of fun characters like Theodora or la nana. I think kids 5 and over will enjoy this movie; however, a drawback for some is that the film is in Spanish.",1416096000,,515,4.548387096774194
