4572962,1,B0055CAIYG,Sorry but is didn't work for me. I was looking for something with resistence bands and after reviewing this dvd it has been on the shelf ever since.,1343174400,,148,4.321428571428571
4572963,5,B0055CAIYG,"I just left a well-deserved 2-star review for Sunshine's ""Boomer Workout"" video (horrid!!!!) but I give this one a 5-star -- it's one of the best (if not THE Best) exercise videos I've found for boomers or those of us who are too out of shape at the moment to go hopping around with a 20-something aerobics bunny!

This one has a variety of exercises that stretch and work out each part of the body. Some use a fitness band (there's a cheap but adequate one enclosed) They can be done in a chair or standing -- none requires getting on the floor. The exercises are easy, but can be made more difficult by increasing the resistance band. The background music is benign -- nothing jarring or intrusive.

I wish there was a little longer transition between exercises. It felt a bit rushed -- one quickly follows the other without time to get into position or anything, but this isn't a major problem since you're pretty much 'in position' for all at the start.

The actual exercise routine is only 26 minutes. The last 6 minutes or so are taken up with a 'relaxation' segment showing flowers and the beach, seagulls and such, along with affirmations. At first, I dismissed this segment, but it really is quite nice and the affirmations are positive and powerful. Frankly, I'm glad the actual exercise routine was this short -- when you're out of shape, 26 minutes can seem like a LOOOOONNNNNGGGGGG time!

Once I'm back in better shape (age is NO barrier) I may give one of her others a try but definitely NOT that horrible Boomers Workout!",1327622400,23,1536,4.574545454545454
4572964,5,B0055CAIYG,"My wife recently had a Total knee replacement. I bought this DVD to help her with her recovery. This DVD helped her gain strength, and improve her balance and flexibility. She enjoys excercising with this DVD, It is like having a personal trainer at home.",1322524800,12,255,4.688888888888889
4572965,5,B0055CAIYG,"This is really worth getting and worth using for anyone who has begun to lose flexibility and good balance.  Very easy exercises, but do require the kind of movement we should be getting naturally every day.",1396051200,3,207,4.75
4572966,5,B0055CAIYG,"This is great for re-starting exercising after a long period of not.  A little slow but that's ok.  For me it is get it first, then go my own pace.
Her voice is pleasant, a smile on her face throughout with lovely background scenery of the beach.

After the exercises there is a cool down period that is like meditation.  First we are talked through a relaxing few moments with relaxing & breathing .

Next she gives us positive thoughts while doing very slow & light stretches.  In the background are relaxing pictures of nature as she gives us more positive words of reinforcement.  More than I expected.  Really do feel better than before I started.",1392336000,7,652,4.560344827586207
4572967,3,B0055CAIYG,This is billed as a senior DV and it really is. One could modify the moves to incorporate more difficulty. The directions on the moves are very  clear and this DV is easy to follow.,1383177600,2,181,4.171428571428572
4572968,5,B0055CAIYG,"I haven't exercises in a long time due to a critical back condition and being my dad's caregiver.  Dad is an invalid.
But, I was feeling really low on energy and my stamina needed a boost (18 hour days 7 days a week is a drain).  Plus I wanted to start loosing weight.  This has worked out well for me.  Sunshine is a good instructor, she takes it slow and easy, with words of encouragement.  Some may not like her constant sunny smile, but I did not find it objectinable.  But I would have liked for her be speaking as the exercises were being done, rather than use a narrator.",1382140800,5,578,4.209090909090909
4572969,1,B0055CAIYG,This exercise dvd was very misleading for me. I have bought Anne Pringle and she has exercise for seniors that is really for seniors. This one has a woman that looks and moves like a robot and the band is so stiff I got blisters. Its a no go for me...Very boring and the exercises are not good for me. Don't waste your money.,1373068800,4,325,4.09375
4572970,4,B0055CAIYG,"These exercises are suitable for seniors with average mobility. The exercise band is not long enough for the exercises. Maybe if I complain, I'll get a longer one.",1365465600,4,163,4.857142857142857
4572971,5,B0055CAIYG,Not only good for seniors but for anyone starting out slow that needs to gentle get the body back into shape.  She is good to take you on this journey step bt step.,1363651200,6,164,3.9696969696969697
4572972,3,B0055CAIYG,"I am 82 and some of the exercises are good but others of them, particularly when using the stretch band, are a bit hard on me.  I am hoping to work up to being able to use the whole video.",1362355200,4,188,3.7
4572973,5,B0055CAIYG,BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR OUR SENIORS AT THE RETIREMENT CENTER.  THEY ALL LOVE IT AND THEY LOVE SUNHINE TOO.  I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE THE FIRST IS WORN OUT.,1361577600,3,160,4.3

8457788,5,B0055CAIYG,I love Sunshine's exercises.  Because I have arthritis the band that it comes with is not too comfortable so I bought my own band to use with it. The one it comes with is good enough to see if you like the video.  A good compliment to her light weights DVD which is my favorite.  Highly recommend this video for all levels of fitness.  If too easy buy yourself a harder band ( the bands on amazon are listed by weight resistance which is helpful. )  Both sitting or standing.  perfect!,1450569600,2,485,4.274725274725275
