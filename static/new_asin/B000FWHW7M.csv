8127536,5,B000FWHW7M,Great movie  the end is the best i can't tell you what happens but only that you really need to watch this movie to find out what happens in the end,1424131200,2,148,3.774193548387097
8127537,1,B000FWHW7M,"Sea of Fear is one of those movies that leaves you amazed at how something so bad could have been written, funded and actually filmed. The guy who made this must have a loose grip on reality because his movie is at its' very best bad comedy. As an example (there are so many), and this is my absolute favorite scene, the girl in the end is laying on top of her boyfriend on the ship's deck kissing him when she reaches for a life preserver... she places it over his mouth and instead of him easily tossing her aside with one of his totally free arms, he flails about like he's actually somehow trapped by her tiny limbs and dies after like 4 seconds. The silliness of the scene is not lost on the actor and actress because they're practically laughing while doing it. If I had just turned this on I would have guessed it was from an SNL skit.

Bottom line- If you're the type of person who can get a good laugh from a preposterious movie than Sea of Fear is for you, for everyone else don't waste your time!",1286064000,3,1007,4.190721649484536
8127538,4,B000FWHW7M,"This story of two vacationing couples is a true ""scary"" murder mystery.  There is intrigue, suspense, action and surprises in this film.  The fact that this murder mystery takes place on a small boat alone in a very large ocean adds to the desperation of the horrible situation the couples are thrown into.  A good ""edge of the seat"" murder mystery, for sure!",1241222400,3,359,4.666666666666667
8127539,1,B000FWHW7M,"Watching Sea of Fear was quite a memorable experience. I didn't feel any fear, but I sure did drown in a sea of submerging boredom, bad acting, and the cruddiest choreography I've seen to date. Pardon me while I dig deep for the right words to describe just how much of a stinker this bumbling abomination was.

But Sea of Fear is a top contender--a top contender in my 25 all-time worst movie list. It was unequivocally the most horrible flick of 2006, and if that is not enough, it now has the added honor of being equaled in awfulness by only 24 other films in existence.

The story is about a group of teenagers who head out to sea for a diving project, but little do they know, a killer is on the boat with them. Trapped at sea, one by one they are picked off and killed. Sound like an interesting story? Well, it's not. Where the lameness of a typically bad movie with rotten teen actors ends, Sea of Fear is just getting started.

The mechanics of the story seem like they would be compellingly scary. The thought of being trapped out at sea on a small boat with a murderer who covers his or her tracks well enough not to get caught sounds interesting. The problem is that director Andrew Schuth sucks and wouldn't know how to make a movie to save his freaking life! To say that this was a poorly constructed film would be a compliment. This is often what you get when you have the same dude directing, producing, and writing!

Randomly throughout the film, the director repeatedly and unnecessarily cuts away from scenes of kids on the boat or at a party on the beach to pictures set to music of corals and fish swimming. Often times, needless cutaways bring the viewer right back to the exact same scene as before with no augmentation whatsoever. But ridiculously cut and spliced scenes are only one problem here.

Imagine ten minutes of the camera rolling where girls sit around on the ship's deck and talk ""girl talk"" only hours after finding out that their friends are missing. And the funny thing is, even the girl talk sucks. The world's preppiest manicure-loving rich girl wouldn't talk this way. No one throughout the film talks normally, in fact. The asinine story progression will have you on the edge of your seat in total awe of how any writer could knowingly create a movie like this and not immediately flee to Zimbabwa afterwards. Don't see this film! Your homemade camcorder movies of you making funny faces and being silly as a kid in the backyard are far better.

Many other jewels are found in Sea of Fear too, like a girl screaming and no sound coming out of her mouth, a kid hanging himself and obviously not being dead, a ship's captain mysteriously tied up and gagged in a closet with no explanation, stupid grins and inane facial expressions, a small girl strangling a decent-sized guy with a life-preserver, and those long-running moments of dialogue where nothing (and I do mean nothing) makes any sense. Watching this film was a mentally torturous experience.

Redeeming qualities? There were none, none at all, unless you count some suspense generated from wondering just how atrocious the film is going to get before finally having the decency to end. The film's finality was no better or believable than the rest of this time-wasting catastrophe. I am well aware of the fact that this review is going to prompt a few of you to watch the movie just for the laughs of seeing something awful, or else to see if what I had to say was accurate. Don't say you weren't warned!

8127541,1,B000FWHW7M,A group of people on a small boat and one by one they all get killed. A very predictable movie with bad acting and a lame story with a boring approach. No suspense no thrills and no chills. This movie belongs on the shelf at the Dollar Store.,1174089600,,242,4.0625
8127542,2,B000FWHW7M,"The premise of the movie is interesting. I mean, who doesn't like a murder mystery, especially the idea of it being at sea, characters disappearing one by one and the audience wondering who it will be? It was enough to make me want to go rent this movie.

However, the problems with this movie come from a plethora of areas. First of all, the acting is pretty atrocious. The characters seem a little wooden, seemingly just going through the motions of the script, and, because of this, many of the scenes kind of just die (no pun intended). Another perplexing element is the preposterousness of having a killer aboard a tiny boat, and no one seemingly being able to see or figure out who it is. Are we to believe that no one can hear the victim's screams as they are being attacked? Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is the over abundance of plot twists (as one reviewer mentioned), and the attempt to explain them all away in the film's final twenty to thirty minutes. This really is a disservice to anyone who actually tried to follow the film. The dark and murky camera scenes make it hard to figure out what is going on much of the movie. Finally, what's with the odd choice of background music during the film? This completely kills any sense of suspense this movie is supposed to have.

This is an average movie at best. At worst, it isn't very good.",1168819200,4,1367,4.464
8127543,1,B000FWHW7M,"Hell's Bells! Can't quite think of what the makers of this one were imagining. Not bad photography and an intriguing premise can't save this improbable, poorly acted thriller from losing its way early on. Entire scenes begin and end, and nothing of any consequence happens...then, when the passengers start disappearing (on a boat so small this plot device is inconceivable) logic disappears as well. The crowd I watched this with threatened to mutiny, especially in the film's excruciating last half hour, in which the ""mystery"" is revealed. I wish the director more success in his future efforts: he does understand the widescreen, but Mother of Poseidon, this one really misses the mark.",1166400000,2,690,5.169642857142857
8127544,2,B000FWHW7M,"SEA OF FEAR isn't a very suspenseful movie, folks.  A group of seven people take a pleasure cruise, stop on some deserted island, reveal their darkest fears and then start getting murdered one by one.

Edward Albert, Katherine Bailess and Christopher Showman ""headline"" the cast, but offer little in their performances to elevate the muddled, preposterous and twist-ridden plot.  It's like TEN LITTLE INDIANS on a sailboat, but nowhere near as intriguing.  This one sinks.",1158192000,3,472,5.253333333333333
