7575793,1,B019HK0V6G,"Being from this area originally, I was quite intrigued to learn there was a DVD out on The Black Sisters. The DVD is BORING. There are cartoon images throughout while someone talks in the background like they're reading from a script. Don't waste your money! You can find out more about The Black Sisters by googling them.",1453680000,,322,4.666666666666667

7575795,1,B019HK0V6G,"This is NOT a movie.  It is a reading with photos. Doesn't even rate as a documentary.  I didn't expect much because of the low rental price, but I did expect a movie.",1451952000,3,167,4.03030303030303
7575796,5,B019HK0V6G,"I was in the last class to graduate from the ""old"" Christiansburg High School in 1974, so naturally I was curious about some of the tales I had heard regarding the black sisters. Philip Church does a great job of giving a history of how it was when the black sisters were in Christiansburg, VA. He also gives a complete history of where they were and what they were up to before and after they came to Christiansburg.",1451606400,,417,4.358974358974359

8745186,2,B019HK0V6G,Did not like the way the documentary was made.  I am a documentary fan and this was  the worst put together one I have ever seen.  I hate it when they refer to the same few pictures over and over.  I did better looking up more comprehensive information on the subject online,1472947200,,274,4.211538461538462
8745187,1,B019HK0V6G,"Once upon a time, a man who thought much of himself gathered a handful of bad drawings and a few old photos, and decided to write a true story.  You might think this is a slim basis for writing non-fiction, and you'd be correct.  His writing is ponderous, pretentious for being created from such a limited vocabulary, and repetitive in the extreme.  It deals with the three Wardlaw sisters and the kerfuffle they caused in Christiansburg, Virginia over a hundred years ago.  If you care.  Too bad if you do, because you won't find out much about it here, and it's all dubious.
Not leaving bad enough alone, he decided to make a film of his endeavors.  He had no more talent for this than writing, but was undeterred.
This is a slide show on film.  The meager collection mentioned earlier, which would not cover a dinner tray, is shown over and over and over while the author reads his stultifying composition.
Dear lord, this is beyond awful, and I think that Amazon should refund my two bucks; I can buy toilet tissue with it, since this masterwork doesn't lend itself to any such useful function.
DON'T EVEN TRY TO WATCH THIS DREK.
I actually think it may have shaved a few IQ points off me.  Be warned!!!  (Organ sting)",1471305600,3,1222,4.5181818181818185

8745193,1,B019HK0V6G,"Being from Christiansburg Va, attending the very school where the stories of the sisters have echoed for years, and knowing respected faculty members who have also told their own stories. I was very disappointed when the author names several of the stories and declares them untrue. I don't necessarily believe in ghost. But I can't say they don't exist because I haven't seen one. There is a book I have read, I believe the title was the east Orange bathroom mystery. This DVD seems to be a derivative of that story with the exception of local stories that the author claims to be untrue. I confronted the author about this, I asked him why he was so opinionated he responded that it was I who was opinionated. My point is the mystery exists. I can't say those things did happen. Just as the author can't say they didn't. I'm a fan of history, and this DVD was not what I expected.",1457308800,,882,4.484472049689441
