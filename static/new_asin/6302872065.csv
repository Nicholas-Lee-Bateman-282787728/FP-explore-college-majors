7832272,3,6302872065,"This is a documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen, which focuses on the lives of those who survived an October 1972 plane crash high in the Andes mountains. The plane had been carrying the Uruguayan rugby team, their friends and families. Forty five people had been on board the plane, when it took off from Montevideo, Uruguay on its way to Santiago, Chile for a rugby match. Only sixteen would survive.

In December of 1972, the sixteen survivors were discovered after they had spent approximately seventy days high up in the Andes mountains. They had endured an ordeal that few would live to tell. Sustained by their faith and a collective agreement that resorting to anthropophagy would be the only way they could possibly survive, they struggled against the odds. Ultimately sixteen would live to tell the tale in what has become one of the greatest survival stories known to man.

This film follows the lives of the survivors twenty years later. It recounts their lives then and their lives now. They discuss their feelings about what had happened to them, the issue of anthropophagy, and how they handled the notoriety which accompanied their return to civilization. It is assuring to see that despite their ordeal, their lives have settled into relative normalcy, though theirs is an experience none of them will ever forget. For those who are already familiar with their story, this is a moderately interesting documentary that ties up some loose ends and is well worth watching. It is just under an hour long.",998179200,29,1517,4.921875
