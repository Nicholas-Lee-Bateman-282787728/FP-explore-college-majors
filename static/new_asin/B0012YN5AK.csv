3099646,5,B0012YN5AK,I will purchase any DVD produced or narrated by David Attenborough. You just can't lose. This man could make mowing a lawn interesting. He involves the viewer so deeply in his documentaries that you crave more. I can't wait til The Private Lives of Plants becomes available on Region 1 [U.S. & Canada] DVD. I contacted the BBC and begged them to consider transferring it to Region 1 DVD. I saw a clip and it looks incredible. This (Wildlife Specials) set is no exception. It is absolutely fascinating as are all of Sir David's work. He is flawless in his work.,1211068800,34,560,4.554455445544554
3099647,5,B0012YN5AK,"I haven't yet seen all the episodes on this set, but what I have watched is predominately very good picture quality. Not as sharp as PLANET EARTH of course, but definitely nice. (Remember to try any not-so-recent material WITHOUT HD upconversion --for those of us who bought those players--before watching with this feature, as it tends to make older signals worse rather than better.)
If you've seen the horrible picture quality of LIFE OF BIRDS and are worried that this set is of similar reprehensible clarity, don't be! It will at least satisfy almost everyone.",1209168000,13,565,4.957894736842105
3099648,5,B0012YN5AK,WOW WOW WOW DAVID ATTENBOROUGH SPECIALS I LOVE TO WATCH IN AWE HOW THIS GUY CAN MAKE YOU STOP AN STARE IN AMAZEMENT HOW OUR NATURAL WORLD AROUND US WORKS.

3099650,5,B0012YN5AK,"As usual with any wildlife DVD that has any connection with David Attenborough, this selection featuring many examples of wildlife from eagles to crocodiles will not disappoint the viewer along with several surprises. For example, I did not know the extent of a female crocodile's devotion to her eggs once deposited or her dedicated protection of the tiny, helpless babies. I've never seen that behavior in any other reptile. Of course, David always adds his succinct and often humorous comments to his narration. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is even slightly interested in nature documentaries.",1376524800,,615,5.222222222222222

3099652,5,B0012YN5AK,"Anything David Attenborough touches can be counted on to be perfection.  This is no exception.  The filming is excellent in this special.  The cats are simply gorgeous, and you always learn a lot from Mr. Attenborough.",1316995200,,218,5.0
3099653,5,B0012YN5AK,"I bought this dvd for my dad, who has watch wildlife documentaries ever since I was a little girl and I was pleasantly surprised that he was a big fan of David Attenborough's documentary series. He enjoyed it greatly :)",1294704000,,219,4.5
3099654,5,B0012YN5AK,A wonderful DVD about wildlife. The British do such a good job on their wildlife shows and it's a pleasure to own them on DVD.,1276560000,,126,4.08
3099655,4,B0012YN5AK,"My husband and I are huge fans of David Attenborough's nature documentaries and I've been collecting them over the years. This set focuses on some amazing creatures and stunning landscapes. There are eight episodes on two discs:

Disc One
Polar Bear: Arctic Warrior
Crocodile: Smiling Predator
Leopard: Agent of Darkness
Eagle: Master of the Skies

Disc Two
Humpback Whales: Giant of the Oceans
Wolf: Legendary Outlaw
Great Natural Wonders of the World
Greatest Wildlife Show on Earth

Pure brilliance, and a must-have for any fan of Attenborough's and nature documentaries.",1275696000,7,574,5.355555555555555
3099656,3,B0012YN5AK,"Up front, I need to state that I adore Sir David Attenborough's work.  I have all his books and (unless I'm missing something) all his DVDs as well.  He is probably the most important wildlife specials producer in this, as well as the last, century.

The CONTENT of this collection is marvelous.  A lot of work went into creating these specials, and it shows.  The footage is unique, especially the night shots of the hunting leopards.  Love them all.

The TRANSFER, however, is horrible.  On our big HD screen TV it looks like a decent VHS copy, but often worse.  This may not show so much on a small screen, but on a larger one, buyer beware.

Why Attenborough's amazing specials receive such lousy treatment while crappy horror movies are released in Blu-ray is beyond my comprehension.  His specials are, at least in my humble opinion, in a class all by themselves and should deserve the utmost care when transferred onto the DVD medium for generations to enjoy.

Citerion, how about tackling this job if nobody else will?  I'd buy each and every release in high quality Blu-ray immediately!",1269993600,23,1095,4.73015873015873
3099657,5,B0012YN5AK,"Great DVD.
Great fun to watch and learn about animals.
Seeing many parts of the world.
Can start and stop when I want.
When I miss something, can replay to hear again or see again.
To learn it is important to see and heard things to learn them.
I enjoy watching over and over again.",1264032000,,282,4.1454545454545455
3099658,4,B0012YN5AK,"Very Good, But Bonus on Disk 2 ""Great Natural Wonders of the World"" is the best I have ever seen by
David Attenborough and I have all his DVD's",1249603200,2,143,3.9655172413793105
3099659,4,B0012YN5AK,"As the title suggests, this is a collection of documentaries on specific animals, including leopards, eagles, and whales. Some of the footage is good, some of it clearly dated. However, it doesn't even compare to David Attenborough's later work. ""Wildlife Specials"" follows a more traditional documentary style of talking about one animal. By contrast, Attenborough's ""Life of"" series explains entire classes of animals or ecosystems. Also, the later documentaries are shot with HD cameras and the quality is really light years beyond ""Wildlife Specials.""

In short, if you are looking for one great wildlife documentary, this isn't it. If you love David Attenborough and can't get enough of him, this is worth checking out.",1248307200,4,724,5.350877192982456
3099660,5,B0012YN5AK,"If you like David Attenborough (and who does not?)as being THE most expert entertaining naturalist available, plus camera work from the best available crew in the world (BBC), there is no reason whatsoever NOT to buy this DVD. I have them all (also the ones not available in the USA, but can be bought through Amazon UK - you will need a player that is universal) and they give you the best insight in our natural world.",1241222400,,420,4.467532467532467
3099661,5,B0012YN5AK,"This two disc collection is a great value, each disc contains four shows narrated by David Attenborough, so it is not overbearing, and it offers beautiful wildlife pictures unhindered by presenters in the foreground.

DISC ONE contains four 45 min shows : CROCODILE, EAGLE, LEOPARD and POLAR BEAR. DISC TWO contains two 45 min shows HUMPBACK WHALE, WOLF, as well as two bonus programs, an hour show that collects some of nature's GREATEST WILDLIFE SHOWS and a 40 min show on NATURAL WONDERS OF THE WORLD.

The main eight shows have all been on PBS and are professionally done, which makes this two disc set more then worth the $20 price tag. The two bonus shows present many different segments about the animal world. I found the Greatest Wildlife Show to be the most entertaining, a one hour show presenting 12 short segments about various animals doing their most impressive natural activities. I think this is a great set of animal video stories and a worthwhile purchase for animal lovers to enjoy.",1235088000,45,1002,4.819767441860465
3099662,5,B0012YN5AK,"As a longtime fan of David Attenborough, who has ALL his nature documentaries, I was as usual not disapointed in this DVD.  The usual fantastic filming, great narration.  The segments are nice too, because you can view one segment(show), and then go back to it and see another the next day.  I love David Attenborough.  He is a class act. I hope he never quits!!!",1231459200,4,363,4.538461538461538

The photography is to die for, and he explains everything with such interest, and knows what he's talking about. It's incredible. If ever there's a series put out by David on DVD, you need to buy it, it's well worth letting your family learn something, than watching mindless TV. All our children love David Attenborough, and all the animals just totally come to life when you watch them from Attenborough's point of view. Also, I recommend ""Life with Mammals, and Life in the Undergrowth"", they are wonderful DVD's to watch together. You won't be sorry if you buy this one too.",1222992000,3,686,4.773109243697479
