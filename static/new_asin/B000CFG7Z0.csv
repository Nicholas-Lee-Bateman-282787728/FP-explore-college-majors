8098911,5,B000CFG7Z0,"To those who dislike the idea of the pilots not being in the gundams, this is just to clarify. The pilots ARE in fact inside them and pilot them from the cockpit. You have to really not be paying attention to think otherwise.

All in all, it's a great series. It deviates from the usual military-style combat for something more unique and the storyline is awesome. Highly recommended for any gundam fan.",1233532800,3,403,4.597222222222222
8098912,1,B000CFG7Z0,"This is such an obvious HK bootleg it's not even funny. Why is Amazon allowing this to be displayed like a legit product??  A 49-episode series on 4 discs????  Hello????

If you want to fork your hard-earned money over to bootleggers, hey, be my guest.  But with 49 episodes squeezed into 4 DVDs, the picture quality is bound to be horrendous.  This is NOT the way to enjoy this unique Gundam series.",1171152000,7,400,4.5
8098913,4,B000CFG7Z0,"I own and love this anime.  On the whole it is one of the best Gundam series, my favorite being seeds.  It takes a new twist on the Gundam series ideas.  Fight for power in a tournament.  All the other Gundam series are about open war.  G Gundam provides a fresh take that allows you to really be drawn into.  If you are a new fan to the Gundam world, I wouldn't suggest this anime.  It strays to far from the others for people just starting Gundam to get a grasp on the idea behind the Gundam Series.  I would instead suggest Gundam Wing, a good intro into Gundam.  If you are knowledgeable in the universe of the mechs know as Gundams, buy it now!  The new twist refreshes your love for the series.

Like I said in the title, there is one MAJOR drawback to the series.  The pilots aren't actually in the Gundams.  They instead wear a skin tight suit, similar in concept to the flight suits the Neon Genesis's Evangelion pilots wear, and the Gundam just does whatever the pilot does.  I really didn't like this.  I felt that the pilot should be in the Gundam, thats is part of what makes Gundam what it is to so many.

Recap:

Veterans should buy for refreshing twist with tournament idea

People new to Gundam should buy something else like Gundam Wing

Terrible idea to have the pilots outside of the Gundams",1150070400,,1311,4.320987654320987
