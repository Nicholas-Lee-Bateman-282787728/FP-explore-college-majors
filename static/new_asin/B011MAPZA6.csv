7337373,5,B011MAPZA6,My dog was my first baby but when my pregnancy got further along I was very worried of how my dog would react without the same attention :( I was so glad when my friend recommended this DVD!!  It answered so many of my questions and even touched on fears I wasn't aware of!  The training is easy to follow and I HIGHLY recommend this for all New Mom's with dogs and even Mom's on their 2nd or 3rd child with dogs!!,1438905600,2,414,4.036585365853658
8724598,5,B011MAPZA6,"As the director of a pregnancy resource center, I am always on the look out for relevant information to share with our clients.  Carrie's video is informative and very well done.  I have developed a lesson for our dog owning clients and will be using it at both of our centers. Thank you, Carrie for a much needed lesson!",1502928000,,321,4.423728813559322
8724599,5,B011MAPZA6,"This is a wonderful educational DVD to help parents-to-be when welcoming a newborn into a dog lovers home! I'm a birth doula and I often have clients asking me how they should welcome their new baby to their dog. After watching this video, I learned that I have been giving poor information to my previous clients. Well, that won't be happening anymore! I'll definitely be recommending  Dogs to Diapers to any future clients with dogs.",1492387200,,435,4.8
8724600,5,B011MAPZA6,"This is an great video. As a dog trainer myself; I on occasion have clients requesting training sessions on how to prepare them for their baby's arrival with their dogs. It is rewarding to me, to see in this video, a confirmation of things that I already have been teaching my clients. Nevertheless, a few things I saw in the video ware new, or at least have been debunked, to what I had learned in the past. As a mother, dog owner and lover... I especially enjoyed the end, when Carrie showed the introduction between her new baby and her oldest dog, it brought tears to my eyes. I would recommend this video to pet dog owners and dog trainers, the price is right and worth it.",1485820800,2,678,4.346456692913386
8724601,5,B011MAPZA6,"Wow! The information in this video would have never crossed my mind. I'm expecting in 3 months, and did not think I needed to prepare my wonderful family dog for the arrival of our baby. Thankfully somebody got me this video, because I realized that he really does need to be prepared. Every dog is capable of biting, and we now know how to properly get our dog to accept and be safe around our baby. One of the most valuable gifts we have received!",1477353600,,449,4.294117647058823
8724602,5,B011MAPZA6,"We discovered this video at the perfect time, one month before our daughter was born. Our dog Toby had recently had a couple of incidents where he acted very much out of character and nipped a guest. This was, of course, alarming since our first child was on the way.

Through this DVD we learned how important it is to recognize a dog's warning sings (such as licking lips) as stressors accumulate and to help the dog realize that leaving the situation is an option. Even better is to give the dog a job to do so that he is not focused on the stressor but on pleasing his master. We also stopped allowing him on the couch for the baby's safety and because it is important for him not to consider himself equal with the baby, as we learned from the DVD.

We're grateful for all that we learned!",1447200000,2,794,4.286666666666667
8724603,5,B011MAPZA6,"I've been around dogs my whole life but now with a newborn in the home this video help to educated me on things I never would have considered. Of course as a new parent you want to make sure you do the best for your children and Carrie is a wonderful example of that.

When I was pregnant, I thought about the safety of my son when being around my animals. I wasn't quite sure what to do or not to do. This movie fills in those gaps and explains everything to do! It's very helpful and is one less stresser to think about!",1444435200,,354,4.144927536231884
8724605,5,B011MAPZA6,"This video came at the perfect time for our family. We have 2 GS dogs (4 and almost 10) which were given to us by a friend over the past 10 months. We were expecting our 3rd child and we had no idea how to incorporate the dogs with the new baby. Dogs to Diapers clearly went over the steps to take and what we should and should not do. We also have 2 teenage boys, so it was really helpful for them as well. None of know how our dogs will behave and it is best to be prepared in every way we can. I can't say enough about this video and how helpful it was.",1444003200,2,556,3.7606837606837606
