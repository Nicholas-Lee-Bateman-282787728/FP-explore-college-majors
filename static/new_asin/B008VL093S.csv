5185320,2,B008VL093S,I didn't really care for this rendition of the classic.  After about 10 minutes I was ready for it to be over.,1388275200,,110,4.0
5185321,4,B008VL093S,"Beautiful art, wonderful music and song and a very charming reading of ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"". I liked this allot. It was the perfect video for a calm & gentle night. This may not be able to hold the interest of todays child who is bombarded with noise & flash from the moment there eyes open. I would like to believe that this was done with that child in mind, slow down, take it easy, enjoy.",1388275200,,404,4.259740259740259
5185322,5,B008VL093S,"My kids and I watched this tonight and I was afraid it was just going to be ""The Night Before Christmas"" poem being read. They saved that for the end. The whole movie was comprised of paintings and my daughter commented on how much she liked the art work. The beginning was classic carol music that was done really well. It may lull your little ones toward sleepiness, but they didn't think it was boring. Their eyes were glued to the screen the whole time and they were all quiet. Such a nice way to end Christmas Eve!",1387843200,,519,4.3061224489795915
5185323,5,B008VL093S,"I just watched it on Amazon instant video through my Roku device, which is connected to my T.V.

I enjoyed it.  It has many beautiful illustrations, although some are better than others.  There are varying artistic styles as more than one artist contributed to this.  My favorite is the snow scene with the bright moon, Santa and his reindeer.

Most of the music is pleasant and calming, as another reviewer noted.  They included one of my favorites, ""Here We Come A-Caroling"", which isn't heard often.  Also, ""Carol of The Bells"", another favorite, along with ""Silent Night"".
As I listened, I thought that Meryl Streep was singing ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"".  Sure enough, in the credits this was confirmed.  As someone with a B.A. in music (vocal), I can say that it wasn't bad.  Her narration was where she shined, though.  Her expression of the lines shows her talent as an actress.

It's probably not best for the average child that is used to a lot of noise and action, such as is prevalent in today's movies, etc.  It's best for those who are the ""artsy type"".  If you aren't, it's probably not best for you.  If you are, you'll probably enjoy it.",1387670400,2,1159,4.612745098039215
5185324,1,B008VL093S,"Really really bad. Poor Meryl Streep, feel sorry for her that she is associated with this. Just horrible. don't bother.",1387670400,,119,5.0
5185325,2,B008VL093S,Perhaps this was meant to be played in the background  and not something you actually sit and watch.  To much music,1387584000,,115,4.428571428571429
5185326,1,B008VL093S,Boring!! Not a real telling of the story. My kids hated it. I tried to make it through but turned it off after 10 mins. Don't bother.,1386979200,,133,3.962962962962963
5185327,5,B008VL093S,"beautiful pictures and soothing music.  my 2 year old wasn't quite as entertained as he would have been had i put on a barney christmas movie, but too bad! lol  He sat through it twice, commenting on what he saw, although he was a bit squirmy (whereas when he's watching one of his shows a bomb could go off outside and he wouldn't move).",1386806400,5,338,4.265625
5185328,2,B008VL093S,"Although Meryl Streep has a wonderful soothing voice over, the video itself is rather simple and boring.  Not sure it would hold the attention of very young children.",1384473600,3,166,4.928571428571429

5185335,2,B008VL093S,"Wanted to show it to a class of 1st Graders. Figured I couldn't go wrong with Ms. Streep. It was SO BORING, I couldn't watch more than a minute or so.",1419120000,,150,3.870967741935484
5185336,1,B008VL093S,I was looking for something to show my class and this wasn't it. The art was great but my students quickly grew bored and I wasn't expecting all the religious undertones. I didn't finish it so I can't truly judge . If it had been for a different purpose then perhaps the review would be different.,1419120000,,297,4.321428571428571

5185338,3,B008VL093S,"Kids got bored fast. Slow animation style - for adults that like to watch paintings change slowly. I recommend for anyone over 50 years of age. Like me, I liked it but we have elementary school kids that have been raised on high-speed entertainment.",1418860800,,249,4.681818181818182

5185340,5,B008VL093S,Very beautifully told and illustrated. Music beautiful also.  I love that it is an AUDIOBOOK but with the pictures and music!  A wonderful way to really SLOW DOWN.,1418774400,,163,4.785714285714286

5185343,1,B008VL093S,"This video is very boring.  We turned it off without even finishing it.  Also, the title is a little deceptive . . . I watched more than a half of the video and never saw any mention of Clement C. Moore's poem, ""The Night Before Christmas.""  Afterwards I learned from another review that the poem is put in at the very end of the show.  The show isn't really based upon the poem though.",1417478400,,386,4.175675675675675
5185344,1,B008VL093S,"I don't like to just lay around watching tv/movies with the kids, but we frequently put on a movie while doing other things around the house...so, I put this on for my kids while they were decorating our living room with Christmas decorations (and I was cooking dinner)...and we all were so bored with it that we turned it off before it was over. Maybe my kids are just too old for this one, but I couldn't even stand to just let it play out so we turned on some music instead.",1417392000,,477,4.195652173913044

5185348,5,B008VL093S,"This is a beautiful telling of Clement Moore's ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"" (aka ""The Night Before Christmas).  Combined with beautiful illustrated renditions of classic carols, this video will be my new Christmas Eve tradition!",1388275200,,227,5.485714285714286
8531035,3,B008VL093S,Its a family tradition of mine to watch this just before bed on Christmas Eve every year. My vhs version broke some time ago and I bought this thinking it was the same however its not. Theres parts missing and I miss it. I really hope you guys can recover the original format again. Its my favorite video of all!,1514073600,,312,4.216666666666667
8531036,2,B008VL093S,"I should have read the reviews beforehand. This would be a nice program to have playing in the background while wrapping presents, making cookies with the kids, or whatever Christmas Eve tradition you may have, but it is not meant for children to sit and watch. My three year old got bored quickly and after 7 minutes in we fast forwarded to the actual poem and while the illustrations were beautiful, they were not interesting enough to regain his attention. Next year we will be sticking to the book.",1482537600,,502,4.651685393258427

8531044,3,B008VL093S,It was not like the original VHS copy I have.  The original had music by George Winston.  This DVD had a different artist.  The rendition of Carol of the Bells just didn't have a classic sound.,1419552000,,193,4.305555555555555
