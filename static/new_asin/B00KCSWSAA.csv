8657652,3,B00KCSWSAA,"I purchased this movie thru other sources (digitally).  The Spanish in this movie is actually Catalan, that is why there are Spanish and English subtitles available.  I watch it primarily for its Catalan language spoken throughout as I am trying to learn the language.  It is a documentary, well done, however, intended as personal insight to an individual's positive attitude in dealing with this life circumstance.",1496275200,,416,5.2727272727272725
