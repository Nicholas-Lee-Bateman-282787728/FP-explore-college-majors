8233192,5,B000009O5W,"no movie can be faster than what legend of the wolf packs...the speed is incredible, and the ironic thing is, donnie yen actually wanted a camera to slow the action down but becuz he shot this film under $1 million US  dollars, he did what he could, and it worked out just fine.  but be  careful, the fight scenes are so fast that if u blink u will miss the  moves, and boy they are some of the tightest moves...be on the lookout for  the fight scene w/the guy w/claws (fifth fight scene) in the woods...that  scene will leave u stunned!",953683200,3,537,4.267326732673268
