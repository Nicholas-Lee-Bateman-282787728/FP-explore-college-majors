Maybe that's why they didn't list what is on the DVD. Anyway, if you're a Mets fan you should check out Mathematically Alive. Great movie about what it means to be a fan and how serious people take the sport. Very interesting and I like that it went beyond the fans and the game and explored the psychological aspects of fandom with a sport psychologist.

While I wish there was more drama and build up to some of the excerpts - Todd Pratt's walk-off homerun against the Diamondbacks as an example - I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.

3122033,1,B00142UZ8K,"OK, so I wasn't around in 1969, but how can you leave out that game

And what the heck is that game with Mets and Yankees where Wright hit a walk off?  That game is barely memorable.  In fact, I had to look it up to see what game they are actually showing on this DVD.

against Atlanta where the Mets scored 10 runs in the bottom of the eighth capped off by a Piazza 3-run home run?  June 30, 2000. That was definitely the most memorable game for me.  Shea was ROCKIN that inning.  And this was in the midst of the hated rivalry between the Mets and Braves.  The days of Rocker and Chipper.  And this was the day after Rocker's return to Shea after making his racist comments.

I was going to buy this DVD set until I found out this game was not featured.  Any mets fan knows exactly what game I'm talking about.  At least I still have it on VHS.",1213228800,6,846,4.030120481927711
3122034,4,B00142UZ8K,"Saw this at Best Buy for $44.99 and Shea Goodbye for $19.99. I live near Flushing and have seen the construction of The Overblown Travesty of Citi Field everyday going to and from work and this looked interesting.
This says it has 6 complete games and totals more than 16 hours and Shea Goodbye has just the highlights and totals only 76 minutes. Not really into baseball too much but living in NY less than 5 miles from Shea Stadium thought I might pickup and watch once Shea was destroyed and that $600+ million retro Ebbets Field with the 20 year $20 million naming rights joke called Citi Field replaced it. unless you're a real diehard Mets fan who wants to watch 6 complete games like they show Yankees games on MSG or YES network here in NY, I'd stick to the 76 minutes Shea Goodbye.",1213228800,,790,4.417808219178082
3122035,5,B00142UZ8K,"Since the picture on the box was too small for me to read and the product description didn't tell me anything I wanted to know, I contacted A&E to find out which games are included in this collection.  Here is their response:

DISC 1: 1969 World Series Game 4 vs Baltimore Orioles--Tom Seaver's 10-inning win was a decisive point of the '69 World Series as the Mets upset the heavily favored Orioles.

DISC 2: 1986: National League Championship Series Game 3 vs Houston Astros--This come-from-behind bottom-of-the-ninth victory ended with Lenny Dykstra's famous walk-off home run.

DISC 3: 1986: World Series Game 6 vs Boston Red Sox--Considered ""Baseball's greatest game"", this improbable 10th-inning, miracle two-out comeback reached its climax with Mookie Wilson's swing and ""...here comes Knight and the Mets win it!""

DISC 4: 1999: National League Championship Series Game 5 vs Atlanta Braves--Robin Ventura's ""grand slam single"" won this 15-inning game endurance test.

DISC 5: Sept. 21, 2001: Regular season vs Atlanta Braves --The emotionally charged first game in New York City after the 9/11 terrorist attacks was electrified by Mike Piazza's 8th inning 2-run home run.

DISC 6: May 19, 2006: Inter-League vs New York Yankees--David Wright's walk-off hit snatched victory away from the cross-town rival Yankees in this classic see-saw battle.

8254196,5,B00142UZ8K,"I am not a Mets fan, but am a fan of baseball alltogether and I recently ordered this set, mostly for both the 1986 games. Plus I always enjoy seeing great games I've never seen before. I've gotta say, now, that I was so moved...almost to tears, by the 1st game at Shea after the 9/11 attacks. Whereas most MLB productions games go right to the first pitch, this one shows the complete pregame honouring those who passed during Sep 11. You can see the emotion on the faces of the players and fans before the game...realizing that everyone there knew at least someone who was a victim. Tears in the eyes of some players and many fans.
