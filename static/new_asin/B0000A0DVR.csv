1900263,4,B0000A0DVR,"Horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are booked on the Trans-Siberian Express? There's a beautiful Countess onboard, too? And Telly Savalas shows up and absolutely steals the show? You'd better believe I bought my ticket for this wild ride. Despite a really, really hokey premise, a rather dark movie print, and a lack of major special effects, Horror Express somehow comes off quite well as a traditional sort of horror film with a quality all its own. The setting is the winter of 1906; Sir Alexander Saxon (Christopher Lee) has discovered a two-million-year-old ""man"" in the frozen wastes of China that may very well be the crucial ""missing link."" Before his men can even get the precious cargo loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express, a nosy little thief ends up dead, his eyeballs completely white. It just so happens that a Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), a scientist not unknown to Saxon, is also a passenger on the train, and his curiosity about the strange crate leads to the baggage man's death. When the remarkably living creature escapes and begins a real killing spree aboard the train, rivals Saxon and West team up to try and stop the rampage of the monster. After they saw the heads off of several white-eyed victims, they are amazed to find brains that are wholly smooth. You know what this means, of course - the creature is somehow sucking the very thoughts out of his victim's brains through their eyes. This helps explain the bleeding from the eyes that also seems to accompany death. Just for kicks, the two scientists take a look at a sample of eye fluid from a victim - and what should appear on the slide but the spitting image of the last thing the victim saw. Then they look at a sample from the monster's eye (the monster has transferred his consciousness to another human being by this point, having had his initial host body pumped full of several holes); visions of ancient creatures and a vision of earth from space leads to the obvious conclusion that what we are dealing with here is a living intelligence who came to earth eons ago. In the movie's defense, the idea that the last image a person sees before he dies would be imprinted upon his eyeball was actually entertained by some thinkers as late as the early twentieth century.

From here on out, it's basically a struggle for all the panicked train riders to avoid meeting up with a pair of glowing red eyes until such time as our heroes, Saxon and West, can identify and kill the creature in whatever form he now possesses. A gorgeous Countess and her annoying Rasputin-like associate add to the fun, but it is the appearance of Telly Savalas in the role of Captain Kazan that breathes new life into the final half hour of the film. Savalas gives an unforgettable performance, obviously enjoying the role of the campy Cossack to the hilt. He doesn't appear for very long, but he packs loads of entertainment into that short time period, doing everything but bringing out a lollipop and asking someone ""Who loves you, baby?""

In a sense, this is not one of Cushing's or Lee's better performances, in my opinion. Together as allies for once, though, their dual presence carries this film on its shoulders. Other than a filthy creature sporting the worst case of pinkeye you've ever seen, many shots of ""ping-pong ball for eyes"" victims, and a couple of cranial autopsy procedures, there's not much gore to be found here. The story sounds rather weak but holds itself together quite well, thanks largely to the inestimably grand performances by the great Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Horror Express, aka Panic on the Trans-Siberian Express, is definitely a ride worth taking.",1127606400,4,3674,4.766091051805337
1900264,3,B0000A0DVR,"I'm a student of Horror/Science Fiction and somehow missed this movie over my 48 years on this planet. However, I viewed this movie and must say not bad! In the beginning it looks to be another crummy movie. But things get interesting around the three quarter mark. In fact,it was at that exact point that it hit me like a snowball from the Abominable Snowman that this plot was that of The Thing. (WHO GOES THERE) by John Campbell.

Only this takes place on a train. You will need to pay close attention to every detail in order to understand how the creature gains his Earthly intelligence. I had to watch it twice to appreciate all those little things I missed the first time. I'm glad this is now part of my collection. Shine On!!!

1900265,4,B0000A0DVR,"HORROR EXPRESS (1973), also known as PANIC IN THE TRANS-SIBERIAN TRAIN, is an unbelievably hokey film with plot points that are unclear, character motivations that defy sense, and science that would make your sixth-grade biology teacher weep.  Yet I really enjoyed the film, because it's genuinely creepy and contains a carefully constructed sense of menace.  Yes, a lot of it doesn't make sense upon reflection, but it's fast paced enough that any story issues don't jar the audience out of the film's mood.

Apart from the establishing moments of the film's beginning, the action takes place entirely onboard a trans-Siberian locomotive.  Anthropologist Christopher Lee is a passenger with a mysterious crate -- the contents of which have already raised the ire of the film's mad monk who warns that the deadly hand of Satan is nearby.  Helping Lee ignore the predictions of doom is Peter Cushing, an English doctor with a morbid and overwhelming curiosity of Lee's business.

The contents of the crate, as revealed in the film's beginning, are the frozen remains of the ""missing link"" -- a two million-year-old half-man, half-ape creature who would represent a fundamental change in the scientific community (if the term ""paradigm shift"" has been invented at the time, they would have used it).  But if you think that this specimen will simply remain a scientific curiosity or won't, for instance, wake up and begin a killing spree, then you simply don't know horror movies.

As the DVD box tells us, the passengers are now under attack from the awakened and angry ape-thing.  I'd never seen a horror movie that used a train as its sole location, but I have seen a number of straightforward thrillers that have pulled off the same trick.  And what made those films successful also works well here.  The claustrophobic atmosphere is genuinely oppressive.  There is no escape from this train (they're traveling through the wastelands of Siberia) and they are completely at the mercy of this horrific monster.  The characters are also always important in such closed-set movies like this, and the fellow passengers are very entertaining here too.

Yes, on paper the plot of this movie is goofy as all get out.  A two million-year-old ape-monster jumping about on a train (and did I mention that he can remove his victim's memories and thoughts?) and terrorizing a bunch of rich folks sounds wacky.  I'm not going to assert that this is a film where you can take everything seriously.

But it is, in fact, seriously creepy.  The manner in which the monster kills his victims is rather disturbing.  And I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I was fascinated by the -- let's say -- relationship between the monster and its victims.  I've seen this before in other genre fiction, yet it seems very fresh here, and it's a very spooky take on the concept.

Oh, and I haven't even mentioned Telly Savalas and his big red coat yet.  They don't show up until the last twenty minutes or so, but in that time Savalas manages to gobble up all the scenery that he would have chewed had he been in the rest of the picture.  He throws his arms around dramatically.  He makes grand, loud speeches.  He stops just short of twirling in circles and bursting into song and dance.  He's supposed to be a Russian military Captain, but he makes no attempt at hiding his New York accent.  He is marvelously, marvelously entertaining.

This is a solid, unnerving horror film whose small budget works to its advantage.  We aren't overloaded with gory special effects, and the inexpensive tricks used work effectively.  There were only a few scenes that I had to turn away from (I absolutely cannot stand to see any foreign object going into an eye, no matter how fake the effect).  What the film can't provide in spectacle, it can more than make up for in sheer pizzazz.

And if you're familiar at all with horror films, you'll certainly recognize the names of the two stars: Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  They were more famous for appearing together in Hammer horror movies, but they don't miss a beat in this independent European film.  Naturally, they have a lot of on-screen chemistry, which is perfectly understandable given that they had made about ten million pictures together before this one.

I'm reviewing the Digiview Production DVD edition.  It's presented in full-screen, and while the picture isn't the greatest, it's a decent enough copy.  This isn't really a film for close and careful study, so I didn't find any defects in the presentation to be overly distracting.

As I said, don't pay too much attention to the mechanics of the story (a major plot point from the beginning of the film is made inexplicable by the conclusion).  Just enjoy this for some good healthy chills.  This is a great movie for late at night when you want to freak yourself out.",1124064000,,4858,4.827085852478839

1900270,3,B0000A0DVR,"I just saw this movie for the very first time after taping it on the DVR during TCM's Halloween horror movie features for the past week or so and the movie did hold my attention for the most part.
No SFX to speak of and I really can't speak for the clarity of the picture since I taped it off of a cable channel, however, I will agree with another reviewer to say that this movie is like a combo of MOTOE meets The Thing, that's about as close as you can get I suppose.
Cushing and Lee however, were at their best in this film. It took a few minutes for me to get used to Chris Lee not taking a bite out of some female's neck, since that's the only kind of horror film I'm used to seeing him in but overall, this is a great flick  to meet your needs for an hour and a half.",1477699200,,773,3.861635220125786

I was absolutely thrilled with this purchase.  Although not a Hammer film, this has always been of of my favorite Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing  collaborations.  Additionally, Telly Savalas is brilliant as a crazed Cossack!  This combo pack is well worth picking up for the price.

1900277,3,B0000A0DVR,"A British anthropologist (Christopher Lee) attempts to  transport a fossilised apeman by train across Siberia, but when the apeman revives, he has some ideas of his own.

Lee and his frequent co star Peter Cushing lend a little of the old Hammer Films magic to this British/Spanish co-production.  I love a good train film, and this story benefits greatly from the juxtaposition of claustrophobic sets hurtling headlong into the night.  The film is best early on, when the pall of mystery is thickest; once the creatures nature has been deduced, the plot starts losing steam.  But, fortunately, thats when Telly Savalas shows up for a fun extended cameo.  This is a very enjoyable horror film.",1460851200,,693,4.982608695652174

1900279,3,B0000A0DVR,"E.A. Solinas' review is right on the money about this one.  Interesting movie that I have wanted to see for some time, but beware of who made the copy because it is a horrible (as opposed to horrific) murky red-brown throughout a large portion of the movie that makes viewing it less suspenseful than eye-straining.  It is also very scratched (the film, not the disc itself) like watching a movie in a three movie for three bucks matinee in a third run theatre.

That in itself doesn't deter me, because it has a lot of nostalgia for me, and I will watch almost anything with Cushing and Lee in it, but to be truthful, I am not sure having once seen this, whether I will seek out a better copy or not.  1 star for the transfer quality. I'd have given it a better rating for Cushing & Lee, but wow, there were a lot of stinky performances by the other 'stars'.",1453939200,,859,4.283950617283951

one I just never made it thru until now. It is better than I first thought probably because the DVD quality is better than the VHS and it doesn't
seem like a bad foreign movie. The story is pretty much like ""The Thing"" but on a train! and of course Cushing and Lee are the stars and
make this movie watchable because there is really no great story here and not much from the co stars except Telly Savalas who shows
up in the last 1/2 hour and then gets killed pretty quickly. I read Cushing and Lee said the studio was crap and the food was horrible!

1900282,5,B0000A0DVR,"BOTTOM LINE: For decades HORROR EXPRESS has had to endure a rep as a classic with only pitiful examples to judge it by. If you have one of those PD copies then immediately toss it into the trash and upgrade to this fantastic new Blu-ray from Severin Films. You won't regret it. For those who have never seen the film and are curious this is a truly haunting, eerie film. I whole-heartedly recommend this new edition of HORROR EXPRESS and rate both the movie & this Blu-ray release a full 5 STARS.

THE STORY: 19th century English archeological expedition in Tibet discovers what may well be the remains of the Missing Link, and quickly arranges to ship the fossils back to London via rail, aboard the Trans-Siberian Express. The fossils are not what they seem however and shortly after pulling out of the station a very real, very hairy and very cranky something-or-other begins stalking & slaying the terrified passengers. As the train rolls through the remote icy mountain passes, the body count continues to rise. What exactly is the damnable thing? What does it want? And who will survive?

THOUGHTS: One of the most maligned horror movies from the early 1970's. The film's shady rep is largely due to the fact that somehow it fell into Public Domain during the VHS boom of the early 1980's, and abysmal garbage-quality copies from cheapjack releasing companies quickly flooded video store shelves & bargain sale bins. These crummy sub-par releases plagued horror movie fans for decades. HORROR EXPRESS is actually a first-rate thriller, with tons of genuine shocks & scares; enough to frighten the bejeepers out of baby boomers and their offspring for over 30 years. It's a masterful suspense/horror thriller that takes the viewer on one fantastically hellish journey into the weird & unknown. Picture a Victorian-era episode of THE X-FILES, mixed with a dash of FRINGE, and set to the stylings of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing team up for the umpteenth time and, as always, are quite wonderful together. Telly Savalas has a brief but memorable role in the second half of the film playing a whacked-out Russian Cossack officer who's brought on board to sort out the murderous goings on. The film design is lush and period-perfect. The actors are all-in for the grisly proceedings. The effects, while primitive by today's standards, are still enough to creep you out and certainly not something I'd subject to young or especially sensitive kids, for fear of igniting some serious nightmares.

THE BLU-RAY: Thank heavens a decent copy of this movie finally surfaced - unearthed in a Mongolian film warehouse of all places! We were then doubly blessed that it fell into the clutches of the good-natured gang at Severin Films, who did a bang up job transferring the film onto hi-def Blu-ray. Now HORROR EXPRESS can at last be viewed without eye & ear strain and properly appreciated for the minor classic it is. There's still some print damage (scratches, dirt & debris) but it looks worlds beyond the detestable Public Domain copies we've suffered until now; a revelation when measured against all previous home video versions. Please note: the film titles are in their original Spanish but the film's soundtrack IS in English. Speaking of which, the audio portion of this transfer is quite solid and fairly damage-free; some occasional pops, hissing & crackles, but all very minor. There's a wealth of nice bonus content to up the value of this release even more.",1451433600,7,3498,4.925423728813559

- Prof. Saxton: ""What am I to do with you?""

One of the most entertaining outings that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing had together was 1972's turn-of-the-century period fright film, HORROR EXPRESS (a.k.a. Panico en el Transiberiano). This sucker incorporated into its plot diverse elements, some of which are a mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza), a glamorous stowaway (Helga Line), a shapely Countess (Silvia Tortosa), a nutso Cossack officer (Telly Savalas), the missing link, memory wipes, zombies, espionage, lockpickers, really messed-up contact lenses, and a sackful of hubris. And made all the more fun, courtesy of the Blu-ray images that come sharp and vivid.

Christopher Lee, for once, plays the hero, but, true to his onscreen persona, it's a character touched by arrogance. In the remote, icy cavities of Provincia de Szechuan, China, in 1906, Professor Alexander Saxton (Lee) unearths the 2-million-year-old frozen fossil of a half-man, half-ape that may prove to be the missing link. Saxton smuggles his anthropological find (now locked in a crate) aboard the Trans-Siberian Express on route to London.

But it wasn't to be a safe passage for the train's crew and passengers. Maybe someone should've gotten a clue when the mad monk's chalk proves unable to etch out a cross on the professor's secret cargo. Director Eugenio Martin does his best to heighten that sense of doom. And, for an oldie flick, the chills are genuine and will creep up on you. The score is atmospheric. When I first saw this years ago, I didn't know I was in store for a series of neat surprises and creative visual flourishes (the alien eyeball autopsy is not to be missed!). We all knew it was only a matter of time before the professor's on-ice laboratory specimen escapes his confines and goes on a sneaky killing spree. It's a fiendish creature with a most unusual modus operandi. Each of his victim makes the unholy beast progressively stronger and more knowledgeable. And, look, now, it's even got mad lockpicking skills. And, when we learn of its true origin, boy, it is staggering!

The supporting cast is certainly colorful, but it's that familiar partnership between Lee and Cushing that anchors the story. Cushing plays Dr. Wells, a fellow seeker of knowledge and rival to Professor Saxton. Wells himself is not immune to pride and to meddling. Watching these two play off each other is like putting on your favorite cozy sweater. You're sort of comforted in the midst of the horror show.",1435276800,,2631,4.972727272727273

I remember watching this one in the '70s on TV and recall how dark it was, the print of the movie itself that is. We had a new color console TV we had bought and the film still looked rather bleak. VHS was years away still and even in the '80s when VHS was so prominent, I rented it one time and the copy was poor to say the least. I am so proud that this movie finally gets it's due on the wonderful format of bluray! I am proudly replacing or buying outright for the first time several movies with these two actors.

If you are a horror fan of movies with these two actors, I highly recommend you get this one to add to your collection. The storyline and plot are well written, in my opinion. I thought the movie was well shot, considering what technology was at hand to do it in 1972 or early '70s. Remaking a movie like this today would cost so much more and probably be not as entertaining as this one. There is that element of realism in this one when one looks at the ""monster"". For me as a kid watching it for the first time, I thought they had dug up something out of a museum to use in the picture. lol Seriously though, I think it still stands as one of the best horror movies to come out of the 1970s and we sure have a few gems in that decade to go along with this title. Well done!

1900306,5,B0000A0DVR,"All aboard the trans-Siberian express where anthropologist Professor Sir Alexander Saxton* secretly transports the frozen 'fossils' of an ancient creature resembling a sort of zombie sasquatch, stowed in a crate, but when the creature thaws and awakens, it goes about absorbing passengers' brains {memory, knowledge, and all}, demonstrated during a trepan revealing a smooth cerebrum. The attacks are a sight to behold - the monster's eyes light up red while the victim's eyes bleed and turn white**. It also has the ability to possess bodies, if needs be. A very uniquely remarkable monster to be sure.

When the crate is discovered empty, only Saxton, his colleague Dr. Wells, and the Police are aware of its existence on the train, and the search is on for the predator.

On board are the Count and Countess Petrovski, along with their cleric Father Pujardov. These are very obviously inspired by Rasputin and the Romanovs. Pujardov seems to have an inkling of the presence of 'evil' on board, confirmed when he spies the ""eye of Satan"" {when the discarded creature's monstrous body is examined, its optical effluvium reveals the personalities of those captured, and where it's been; rather like the imprisoned souls in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devils-Rain/dp/B0031ZNGFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devils Rain</a>} through a microscope. Folkloric and Scientific perspectives upon the same anomaly. It seems that upon sensing the beast, he quickly goes from praying to ""God"", to wanting to be the creature's servant. which is rewarded as he becomes a willing host.

Also on board is one Captain Kazan {Telly Savalas}, a brutal dictatorial man of iron who will not be overcome by the creature, but meets a grisly fate nonetheless.

Eventually, another surprising attribute is displayed by the creature's power, as corpses rise to aid his sinister purposes. The Science Fiction element is quite intriguing, adding yet another layer to the plot and monster.

Horror Express features the impressive talents of Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Telly Savalas, making for a thrilling ride through and through, which you may wish to take again.

This horror science-fiction thriller, a cult favorite, takes place in 1907. Professor Caxton (Christopher Lee), a fossil-hunter has discovered some sort of pre-human creature frozen in ancient Manchurian ice. He is traveling to London with his find on the Trans-Siberian Railway and is horrified to discover that his frozen man is missing, and corpses and zombies are appearing all over the train. It turns out that the frozen specimen is an alien with some unusual powers. The combined forces of Professor Caxton, his rival Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), and a Cossack captain (Telly Savalas) are needed to save the world from this monstrous being. Skillfully told, with a good dose of humor. A great watch for the entire family!",1381536000,,883,5.089655172413793
1900308,4,B0000A0DVR,great movie on a train with a hairy kojack.  i think the diner cart seen was played too much for laughs but still the ending was a real delite.,1379462400,,143,3.9310344827586206
1900309,5,B0000A0DVR,"I love trains in movies, and Spain's journey into the macabre, HORROR EXPRESS (1972), takes to the rails for a terror ride unlike any I've ever seen. The interesting premise takes place in the early 1900's aboard the Trans-Siberian Express which is carrying a prehistoric creature that escapes and goes on a killing spree. Horror legends Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are fellow anthropologists who discover that the brain-sucking  monster's origins go back even further than their science can calculate. Telly Savalas is tops as a crazy Cossack who hijacks the train.

HORROR EXPRESS keeps its momentum of suspense and shock chugging along at full steam, courtesy its director, Eugenio Martin. The film contains some grisly imagery, such as when the creature attacks its victims leaving their eyes white and bloodied. There's also a scene of an operation in which the top half of a person's skull is removed. The creature itself is effectively shown in brief shots and is pretty nasty looking. Adding to the unique, creepy atmosphere is a memorable music score by John Cacavas.

I first saw this cult favorite on a budget DVD set with badly faded color and incorrect aspect ratio. Even under such undesirable viewing conditions, I could appreciate that an excellent film was begging to burst forth. My hopes were vindicated when I picked up Severen's gorgeously restored Blu-ray/DVD Combo Edition. Transferred in HD from pristine vault elements, this is the way HORROR EXPRESS was meant to be seen.

 The extras include an intro by Fangoria Magazine editor Chris Alexander, an interview with director Eugenio Martin, a discussion about the McCarthy era with producer Bernard Gordon, a 1973 audio interview with Peter Cushing, an interview with composer John Cacavas on Telly Savalas, and the original theatrical trailer. The disc contains the original Spanish language with English subtitles, and the English dubbed track.

HORROR EXPRESS is an offbeat, underrated mixture of horror and science-fiction with touches of humor that's well worth checking out. This is one train ride you'll be taking again, trust me.",1378166400,,2118,5.214705882352941

This is the best quality and transfer for this film so far (in the U.S., anyway). Well worth the money. This is one of those rare movies that star longtime friends and colleagues Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing who are NOT at each other's throats, but are on the same side against a seemingly immortal creature.

The colour is crisp but the sound could be better - I detected some hiss in parts of the film.

There are many reasons why I love this film. Firstly it is a Spanish horror film. How many Spanish horror films have you seen? The only other Spanish Horror film that I've seen is ""Sound of Horror"" a little known gem that hopefully will be restored one day.

Other reasons why I like this film are the actors - Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Telly Savalas - what a combination! The whole film is set on a train with a creature on the loose sucking the minds of its victims.

The story is not too far fetched. An alien creature comes to earth millions of years ago, it gets left behind and the only way it can survive on earth is to inhabit the bodies of other creatures. In the process it has the ability to suck the minds of its victims in the hope of finding the technology to escape the earth.

Pretty good story. The acting is excellent and the suspence is constant.

All in all a great film with a difference.",1359590400,,1150,4.180995475113122

1900319,5,B0000A0DVR,"It's got a stylish, modern title, and its opening titles are in a slick, hyper-modern font...from the opening moments, this is clearly a film for the modern mind. But it's actually a period film...and it closes with a rock music version of its theme...I guess we could call this Period Cool!

A frozen caveman-like creature dug up in an archaeological expedition comes to life and begins killing the passengers of the Trans-Siberian Express. That may sound like sufficient material for a low-budget horror piece. But two rival scientists on the train quickly discover that much more is going on, and are forced to work together to stay alive!

The enigmatic creature appears to be getting smarter with each person it kills--indeed, it appears to be draining the minds of its victims and absorbing their intelligence.  But ""There's something more..."" It gets even more interesting than that--and you're going to have to watch the film to find out what happens.

This is one of the best horror films of the 1970's...featuring many creative ideas and a fine cast including Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas (who steals the show during his brief appearance) and Silvia Tortosa. Everyone is lots of fun, and while this film is fairly gory, it's no mere bloodbath. It requires constant attention from the viewer as the story is actually rather complex. And unlike the characters we find in most current horror films, the characters in ""Horror Express"" are intelligent people, and their attempts to analyze the strange science-fictional situation in which they find themselves are most engrossing. Heck, even the monster in this movie is smart.

It's strange to consider that, though it features all the trappings of a horror film (monster, reanimated corpses, chilly environment, etc.) it has little of the conventional atmosphere...it's very thinky, and so cleverly funny that the word ""giddy"" can be used to describe it. The cast seems to have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an interesting story. It transcends its genre.

So much fun that the rough edges from its low budget are easy to ignore. One of the most enjoyable things Lee and Cushing did together.",1342828800,,2177,5.050139275766017

1900321,3,B0000A0DVR,"Horror Express has always suffered from the fact that most available prints were dark and grainy--almost painful to watch!
This blu-Ray, however, is crisp and clean--a pleasure to watch.
Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are, as usual, quite good.  The story is interesting and internally coherent if a bit confused.
The big problem here is Telly Savalas.  He seems to be in another film and his entrance and over-the-top performance really hurt the film.
Still, it's an entertaining piece of film history--and one I would recommend to any horror fan with a bit of patience and the ability to ignore a high-ham content.",1336348800,2,619,5.0
1900322,4,B0000A0DVR,"Severin films has released Director Eugenio Martin's 'HORROR EXPRESS'-1972 into the Blu-Ray age.  Since the original negative had a murky, grainy look to it when I saw it theatrically, this release resembles an improvement over the Image Entertainment release from over a decade ago but not much of a difference.  The 1.85 transfer looks about the same in the DVD disc included with the Blu-Ray and it seems that these companies believe that if you release any film in that format, it will blow you away.  Not true, proof of that is the Blu-ray release of Director Roger Corman's 'THE TERROR'-1964 ,some of these films negatives cannot improve because they were inferior to begin with. The transfer, however, allows you to enjoy the bantering of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee as they are serious one minute spouting scientific jargon and the next they are flirting with hot babes Helga Line and Silvia Tortosa. You will recognize many Spaghetti Western faces such as Jorge Rigaud and why not, Director Martin gave us many underrated Euro-Oaters.  Enter Telly Savalas into the mix and you have one of the most entertaining hoots in Horror history all taking place on a train which is one of my favorite things. The memorable music score by John Cacavas with its catchy whistle refrain and Photography by Euro cult artiste Alejandro Ulla makes the film gell to the max making the absurd plot easier to swallow.  Recommended to all Horror fans, the Blu-ray format is not necessary to appreciate this cult classic.",1334361600,,1514,4.921568627450981
1900323,2,B0000A0DVR,"In many ways, this is typical early '70s Brit horror schlock.  The basic plot of the film is that a corpse of a ""missing link"" is found in China, and shipped to somewhere in Europe (assumedly England, though I don't recall any of the characters really saying where they were going) via rail-road across Russia, and the characters who are riding the train are then terrorized by victims of the awakened ""spirit"" that possesses the ""missing link""--a somewhat demonic, otherworldly, alien spirit that ultimately seems to want to go to space.  (None of this is ever explained very well, unsurprisingly, but it doesn't really matter much, either).  At the very beginning, with voice-over narration to a historical society regarding a catastrophe, long introductions to several characters and their interactions, and the usage of a spooky song (played via piano by characters, as a score by the makers of the movie, and whistled several times), it opened well.  Christopher Lee is good, a combination of awkward action hero and gruff misanthrope as a scientist who obtains the 2-million-old corpse of a ""missing link"" and who struggles first against those whom he thinks mean to exploit it (at the expense of his own exploitation of it, of course), and than in understanding what it going on, and finally against the ""spirit"" which once possessed the ""missing link.""  So is Telly Savalas in a strange but enjoyable bit of casting as a Cossack commander, chewing up scenery and swaggering, though I don't think he appears until the last 40 minutes or so of the film.

However, the plot meanders and most characters are never fully developed. Certain conventions of the Brit 1960's/70's horror films--beautiful women, languid nobels, brilliant scientists, foolish peasants, traditional views of Victorian manners, exotic locales, etc, are used, but, frankly, poorly and clumsily compared to a few of the ""classics"" of the era (several of the well-known Hammer films, for example). At least one character is so oddly drawn--the Russian priest--that I can't help but think the writer of this film was caricaturing him to skewer some sort of deep psychological problem with organized religion. Some of the cinematagraphy is amateurish. Special effects are typical of the period and of this type of movie--blood that looks like red paint, a glowing red eye that shines like a lightbulb, zombies who are just actors with white contact lenses in their eyes--with ruddy cheeks, no less. And then, the movie just ends, after an attempted zombie takeover of the train, and most of the train explodes, and some of the people are saved, I guess.

Ultimately, another of those somewhat entertaining films that had a lot of potential but was doomed by mediocre direction, poor writing, a lack of funding, a inability to break from genre conventions, and a certain lack of imagination.",1333238400,,2863,5.065817409766455

A nice tale of a fossilized creature brought on a train that thaws out and creates havoc on board.  Classic horror stars Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Telly Savalas lead the way against it.",1328832000,2,303,4.69811320754717
1900328,4,B0000A0DVR,"Director Eugenio Martn's 1972 fright film, HORROR EXPRESS (PNICO EN EL TRANSIBERIANO) is, arguably, the most interesting and enjoyable 70s pairing of acclaimed horror film stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Long considered to be in the public domain in America, this British-Spanish co-production has seen dozens (at least) of crappy, washed out, battered-looking video releases over the years. Now, thanks to the fine folks at Severin Films, this Gothic gem finally receives the high-quality, high-definition treatment it deserves in an extraordinary DVD/Blu-ray Combo pack.

In 1906 China, Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee, HORROR OF DRACULA, THE RESIDENT) unearths a frozen fossil in the Manchurian province of Szechuan that he believes may be the ""missing link."" Determined to bring the fossil back to England, he crates up the creepy creature's remains, drags it to Shanghai and boards the trans-Siberian Express train, where he encounters professional rival Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, SHOCK WAVES). During the trip, an alien entity trapped within the icy corpse is released, possessing various passengers, absorbing their knowledge and memories, and then moving on, leaving blank-eyed corpses in its wake. The two British scientists set out to identify and destroy the creature, but their efforts are complicated by paranoia among the survivors and the arrival of an overbearing Russian military officer (Telly Savalas).

HORROR EXPRESS is a delightfully claustrophobic and suspenseful mishmash of Gothic horror, zombie, sci-fi and serial killer tropes, with a dash of 70s Satanic possession elements tossed in for spice. With a twisty, witty and constantly surprising screenplay written to take advantage of a detailed - and startlingly realistic - vintage steam train model built for another movie, HORROR EXPRESS is 90 fast-paced minutes of thrills, chills, and terrific performances by a talented, International cast. The special effects are remarkably good - and surprisingly gory - for a film of its vintage, and the production values are top-notch. The eerie score by composer John Cacavas is also noteworthy, adding considerably to the overall success of the film.

Cushing and Lee are in fine form, the two old friends playing off each other magnificently, and - unlike many of their 70s pairings - enjoying equal screen time and prominence in the plot.  Eurobeauties Helga Lin and Silvia Tortosa provide lovely eye candy, and Savalas is a hoot as the arrogant Cossack, Captain Kazan, assigned by his superiors to investigate the murders on the speeding train.

As stated above, HORROR EXPRESS has seen many previous home video releases on VHS and DVD, including a fairly decent, non-anamorphic DVD from Image Entertainment back in the late 90s. For this new edition, Severin Films has used the original Spanish negative as the source of their 1.66:1 widescreen 1080p HD transfer. Clearly, the custodians of the negative didn't take particularly good care of it - there is minor damage throughout in the form of specks and small scratches. But the colors are bright, detail is astounding, and the overall visual presentation is light years superior to any previous home video release. Two audio options are provided: English and Spanish dialogue tracks in Dolby 2.0 mono.

Severin has assembled a nice batch of supplements, including an enthusiastic Introduction by Fangoria editor Chris Alexander, new interviews with director Martn, producer Bernard Gordon and composer Cacavas, and a vintage audio Interview with Peter Cushing, which can be played as a commentary over the film, and which covers the distinguished actor's film career in great detail. Finally, there's the creepy theatrical trailer, along with previews of three other Severin titles - PSYCHOMANIA, NIGHTMARE CASTLE and the forthcoming THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD.

This new HORROR EXPRESS Blu-ray/DVD combo is, by far, the finest presentation of the movie to date, and barring a future, frame-by-frame digital restoration, likely to be the definitive video version for some time to come. Fans of the film and or the Lee & Cushing team - even if they don't own a Blu-ray player - should pick it up; it's reasonably priced and the DVD contains the same fine transfer and bonus material as the Blu-ray disc, albeit in standard definition.

HORROR EXPRESS is a classic chiller, and highly recommended.",1328659200,24,4430,5.364028776978417

The pairing of Lee and Cushing has always been a draw for fans of European cinema.  Hammer made both actors international stars, pitting them against each other in such classics as The Horror of Dracula (US title) and The Mummy.  In this Spanish co-production, both actors, cast as rivals, must join forces to beat an ancient evil that threatens to kill everyone aboard the Trans Siberian Express. There is horror, humor, and gore for everyone.

1900332,4,B0000A0DVR,"I originally saw this film on SciFi Channel back in the early nineties during a Halloween marathon of horror films.  This is probably one of the best Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee movies, that rival even some of their better hammer era films.  The atmosphere isolated and creepy and the special effects are simple but very effective and startling.  It's also a real treat to see Lee and Cushing working together.

The best way to describe this film is ""Murder on the Orient Express"" meets ""The Thing"".  A strange prehistoric missing link creature in discovered in a frozen countryside by Christopher Lee's character and is transported on a train.  Cushing plays Lee's professional rival, but they soon join forces when they discover the creature is a not so dead alien and is on the rampage turning passengers into mindless zombies.

The movie's not perfect.  It has some awkward dialog in some spots, but other then that this film is an often overlooked diamond in the rough.  If your a fan of films like the Hammer Studios horror films or just curious about older horror movies of yesteryear give this one a try.

The Spanish credits and use of its original title further enhanced the feeling of seeing this for the first time.  The use of a 1973 Peter Cushing interview as the commentary track is a nice touch, as is the inclusion of three ""bonus"" trailers.

1900336,3,B0000A0DVR,"Please note that this review is for the quality of this Blu Ray disc only.  The movie itself is definately 5 stars! I am disappointed with this Blu Ray release.  It appears that there has been little or no restoration to the so-called newly found print from Mongolia of all places.  Sure, the picture quality itself is up to Blu Ray standards as compared with the DVD (also included in this package).  But as you probably know, there have been several ""public domain"" releases and one official release (now out-of-print) from Image Entertainment. Well, the dots and print scratches are still here on this Blu Ray release! In some cases, depending which DVD release you compare it with, there is a slight reduction in these imperfections, but I guess I'm spoiled by other Blu Ray releases that have previously only been available as poor quality ""public domain"" material DVDs.

Here is an example:  If you're a fan of these classic, yet underated or obscure horror flicks, then you may be familar with Roger Corman's ""The Terror"" starring Boris Karloff and a very young Jack Nicholson (1963).  There have been at least a dozen DVD releases of this film, most of fairly poor quality, scratches, washed out color, etc. And I owned all of them! But earlier this year, Film Crest, Inc. released it on Blu Ray, Digitally Remastered HD Restoration, and the quality is breath-taking!!  Hardly a speck or scratch. There is even a side by side restoration comparision in the menu.

Sadly, this is not the case with ""The Horror Express."" But here it is, a Blu Ray that falls short in the restoration department.  Still, I suppose it is worth owning for its 1080p resolution, but I guess (to use the title of a more recent Jack Nicholson film) this is As Good As It (is going to) Get(s).",1322611200,11,1775,4.678456591639871

1900339,5,B0000A0DVR,"I agree with E.A. Solinas' review, yet for the reasons he expressed, I am giving Horror Express five stars.  Arguably, four stars might be more appropriate, but, I have great affection for this film and will give it an additional star from emotion.

The ""best"" of any genre may be defined differently.  I think Horror Express is the best of the Cushing-Lee vehicles and, in its own right, a remarkably entertaining, endearingly quirky film the outrageousness of which actually works to its benefit.  It is the kind of horror film romp that pleasingly detaches you from reality and makes you happy to ""suspend disbelief.""  It may not be groundbreaking as was Horror of Dracula, nor open the door to new genre approaches as did Curse of Frankenstein.  But, among the Cushing-Lee teamings, it is the most enjoyable from all regards and the most satisfying because it uses the wonderful interplay of those two compatable but different actors to the best advantage.

Unlike most of their other films, Lee and Cushing share many scenes in this intricately plotted film.  Lee portrays his classic hero: stalwart, humorless, brave, stuffy but decent and more emotional than the character would admit outright.  Cushing escapes from the Van Helsing mode (which he certainly portrayed so well), for a different heroic model: impish, conniving, humorous, a bit randy but ultimately brave and willing to risk himself for the sake of others.

Their characters seem to begrudgingly respect and even like each other, but they grate, allowing these good actors to interact vividly.  Their droll, spot-on classic British styles fit nicely in the exotic world of the ""Orient Express"" suddenly gone mad with seemingly supernatural danger and political intrigue.  More than any other film, these two highly enjoyable actors get to play against each other.  It truly is delightful, not a word that often applies in such films.

The script is tight and clever.  The supporting players are earnest and able, with a nice, brief turn by Telly Savalas that is at once funny and frightening.  The plot is ridiculous, but definatly works.  Like many Hammer and Amicus films, despite low budgets, the sets, costumes and such are lush (I read that the train is the one used in Murder on the Orient Express, but a commentator on this discussion list disagrees and likely that commentator is correct.  The director and editor have kept the pacing crisp.  Horror Express is a horror-comedy of the rarest type, funny when meant to be funny, scary (or at least tense) when so intended, well acted, interesting, engaging, in sum, highly entertaining.

For these reasons, I rate it the best of the Cushing-Lee movies.",1316217600,16,2680,5.006772009029345
1900340,3,B0000A0DVR,"Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were ""the best of screen enemies"" (to quote Lee). So it's entertaining to see them in a different kind of movie, such as ""Horror Express,"" a somewhat hokey horror movie that is made up for by some excellent performances and pervasive creepiness. You'll never look at a fossil quite the same way again.

Professor Saxton (Christopher Lee) uncovers a frozen ape-man in northern China, and has it crated and loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express. But after his colleague Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing) bribes the baggage man to peek inside, the baggage man is found dead, with bloody white eyes -- and the fossil is gone. More people fall prey to the creature before it's fatally shot by a Russian police officer.

But it soon becomes apparent that the creature may be dead -- but whatever was inside it has just moved on to its next host. Wells and Saxton try to puzzle out what they are dealing with, while a mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza) tries to help the possessed officer, believing him to be Satan. To top things off, a force of Cossack soldiers have arrived to deal with the threat...

""Horror Express"" is one of those movies that would normally be B-grade all around -- capable, but nothing really memorable. The plot about a bodysnatching, memory-sucking alien is kinda hokey. But it's the presentation that makes it really interesting, with Lee and Cushing as a pair of scientists, and a sense of mystery around what the creature really is.

And it all takes place in the confines of a train, which gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling, as well as making it seem a bit like a horror version of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" The dialogue ranges from silly (""There's a stink of hell on this train!"") to slyly satirical (""But what if one of you is the monster?"" ""Monster? We're BRITISH, you know!"").

Lee and Cushing are the bright spots in here, as the uptight, scientific-minded Saxton and the friendly Wells, who keeps rubbing Saxton the wrong way. It's interesting to see them as allies (""friends"" would be pushing it), and the the two actors give plenty of little details to their strong performances. Dracula and Van Helsing, they ain't. And Telly Savalas shows up briefly as a swaggering, likable Cossack captain.

So from what I've been able to work out, this set is a dual blu-ray/DVD which is hi-def 1.66:1, and has a director interview, an interview about Telly Savalas, an audio interview with Cushing, a new introduction, the trailer, an Easter egg and... an interview about the McCarthy era. HUH?

""Horror Express"" is basically a B-movie with the usual weak and solid moments, but some grade-A talent making it worthwhile. Enjoyably spooky.",1309478400,,2692,4.801295896328294
1900341,3,B0000A0DVR,"Sometimes a movie with weak acting, marginal special effects, and uninspired dialogue can still be worth watching.  Such is the case with ""Horror Express,"" also known as ""Panic in the Trans-Siberian Train.""  As you will note, occasionally the title that survives is the better title.

Professor Sir Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee, who has more movie credits than I could ever hope to list) has discovered a bizarre fossil in Manchuria.  Sir Saxton is taking his find across Siberia on the, yes, you guessed it, Trans-Siberian Express.  There are sundry and assorted characters, including Dr. Wells, played by Christopher Lee's long-time friend and veteran actor Peter Cushing.  Any movie containing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing is worth watching because these two always had excellent screen chemistry, which shows in this film.

We know early on in this movie that something strange is happening because a petty thief wandering near the box containing the fossil exchanges normal eyeballs for boiled egg eyeballs.  While the eyes look cool, they can put you off from hardboiled eggs.

Once on the train, there are a couple of side plots that are sufficiently brief to avoid being annoying.  After the focus turns to the creature, it mostly remains on the creature, until Telly Savalas appears.

I will attempt to avoid spoiling the plot too much, but there is some risk that I will reveal more than I should.

The creature turns out to be more difficult to kill than you might imagine.  Mere bullets slow the creature down, but stopping the creature takes more than a bit of lead.  Even a bunch of heavily armed soldiers only provides a workout for the creature.  It is obvious to the casual watcher that something more drastic is required to stop this critter, and our heroes eventually step up to provide a solution.

We also learn that the creature has some unique capabilities, one of which call to mind the 1951 movie ""The Thing from Another World.""  Another ability the creature has is to have eerie red-glowing eyes in the dark.  Those red light bulb eyes are scary by themselves.

Things ramble along nicely until Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas) boards the train to get things under ""control,"" said with more than a little tongue-in-cheek.  Captain Kazan has an outrageous red coat that recalls another era, such as the 1960s and the 1970s.  Telly Savalas manages to steal scenes for as long as he remains talking, helping to liven the movie up considerably.

Of course, all good things must end, and so does this movie.  The final special effects are even cheaper than the special effects for the rest of the movie, but the special effects are in character for the style of the movie.

This movie is hardly one to make any ""best of"" lists.  As I noted earlier, this movie has a number of issues.  I neglected to mention some other issues, including Natasha saying that she had to get out of Shanghai, even though Shanghai is a long way away from Peking (where everyone was boarding), the misspelling of Christopher Lee's name in the credits, and the improper red star on a soldier's hat, recalling that this movie takes place before the Russian revolution.

In spite of the problems, this movie is fun to watch.  Lee and Cushing are marvelous, though I thought Lee was a bit wooden in his performance.  Lee and Cushing were on the same side in few movies, which may be the best reason to watch this movie.  The film gets a lot of mileage from its creature, which is surprisingly effective despite being low budget (eerie red eyes are always winners).  Telly Savalas is great, though he seems deliberately hammy.

With big budgets and CGI effects being the focus of current films, movies such as this one are no longer in vogue.  Yet, movies like this are fun and enjoyable.  If you are a fan of ""classic"" horror, which includes the Hammer films, then you may find this movie to be enjoyable.  It is certainly entertaining.

Enjoy!",1305158400,,3946,4.794074074074074
1900342,5,B0000A0DVR,"This isn't a Hammer Film which is why one might inadvertently miss this obscure but superb pairing of Christopher Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B00009TB5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>) and Peter Cushing (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B00005NSXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>) in this huge sleeper of a Gothic classic horror flick. It's chiefly a Spanish-made film (directed by Eugenio Mart&iacute;n) and slightly inferior in that aspect to Hammer Film productions, but what a great story!

An important point, the first copy of this movie I obtained was from the local Dollar General Store where I paid eighty cents for the *slimcase* version. It was a pretty marginal copy and the credits were nearly unreadable. It also jumped and jiggled a bit out of frame from time to time. This is not the case with this re-mastered edition. It's a nice clean print from beginning to end. Yes, some of the color saturation is now leaning toward the reds but this could hardly be unexpected.

The story [setting: early 1900s Siberia]: An alien monster is unearthed as a frozen carcass in Siberia by an archaeologist (played by Lee.) It's crated up and loaded aboard a trans-Siberian express train bound for the west. At the embarkation platform, a thief who attempts to gain access to the crate's interior is suddenly found dead and a rogue monk at the scene professes the crate's Satanic nature - but his rantings are ignored by fellow passengers. They should have listened because life on the train goes really downhill from that point forward. The creature escapes from the crate and can absorb the knowledge from peoples' brains simply by staring at them - but naturally the victims drop dead as their memories are thus erased.

About halfway through the film, a Cossack Captain (artfully played by Telly Savalas:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B0007TKNM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>) comes to the rescue (in a Cossack sort of way) after he and his guttural Mongol-like faction of soldiers board the train and take over the pursuit of the murderer.

1900353,4,B0000A0DVR,"Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing battle a shape-shifting alien that sucks peoples' brains through their eyes after escaping deep freeze on a trans-siberian express. This movie is every bit as awesome as it sounds  -  with zombies, a murdeous cossack, a crazed Rasputin wannabe, and Cushing firing a shotgun that is almost as big as he is. One of my favorites.",1206921600,4,360,4.885245901639344

1900355,3,B0000A0DVR,"Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were ""the best of screen enemies"" (to quote Lee). So it's entertaining to see them in a different kind of movie, such as ""Horror Express,"" a somewhat hokey horror movie that is made up for by some excellent performances and pervasive creepiness. You'll never look at a fossil quite the same way again.

Professor Saxton (Christopher Lee) uncovers a frozen ape-man in northern China, and has it crated and loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express. But after his colleague Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing) bribes the baggage man to peek inside, the baggage man is found dead, with bloody white eyes -- and the fossil is gone. More people fall prey to the creature before it's fatally shot by a Russian police officer.

But it soon becomes apparent that the creature may be dead -- but whatever was inside it has just moved on to its next host. Wells and Saxton try to puzzle out what they are dealing with, while a mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza) tries to help the possessed officer, believing him to be Satan. To top things off, a force of Cossack soldiers have arrived to deal with the threat...

""Horror Express"" is one of those movies that would normally be B-grade all around -- capable, but nothing really memorable. The plot about a bodysnatching, memory-sucking alien is kinda hokey. But it's the presentation that makes it really interesting, with Lee and Cushing as a pair of scientists, and a sense of mystery around what the creature really is.

And it all takes place in the confines of a train, which gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling, as well as making it seem a bit like a horror version of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" The dialogue ranges from silly (""There's a stink of hell on this train!"") to slyly satirical (""But what if one of you is the monster?"" ""Monster? We're BRITISH, you know!"").

Lee and Cushing are the bright spots in here, as the uptight, scientific-minded Saxton and the friendly Wells, who keeps rubbing Saxton the wrong way. It's interesting to see them as allies (""friends"" would be pushing it), and the the two actors give plenty of little details to their strong performances. Dracula and Van Helsing, they ain't. And Telly Savalas shows up briefly as a swaggering, likable Cossack captain.

The Diamond Entertainment copy I saw was not in great condition -- it was rather blurry and dull-sounding. Just  not very good, especially since better copies are available for not much more money from Geneon/Pioneer.

""Horror Express"" is basically a B-movie with the usual weak and solid moments, but some grade-A talent making it worthwhile. Enjoyably spooky.",1155772800,9,2621,4.834821428571429
7995047,5,B0000A0DVR,"I thought it a somewhat odd film for Lee and Savalas, but perhaps because it's a foreign production. Overall it's an entertaining movie if you like unusual foreign films.",1519689600,,170,4.896551724137931

7995055,5,B0000A0DVR,"The first time I saw this I was on my break at work. It was one of those public domain bargain movies in the slip cases and I thought ""this is going to be terrible"", but it had Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and I love their Hammer films, and I had an hour to kill so I thought ""why not""? The sound and picture quality WAS terrible, but the story and the tone was so engrossing and fascinating I couldn't help thinking ""this is actually pretty good, if only it wasn't so dark and grainy and I could see what was happening on-screen""! Finally, after all this time, this movie gets the treatment it deserves. This is one of the best HD transfers I've ever seen in my life, it's like watching a different movie entirely!!! I won't go into plot details, as many reviewers have done so already. I'll simply say if you're a fan of gothic horror, British horror, Hammer films (this isn't a Hammer film, but it feels like one), or sci-fi B-movies, this ranks up there as one of THE best!!!! Required viewing!!!",1487203200,,1006,4.3563829787234045
7995056,4,B0000A0DVR,I know some reviews said this is a poor looking disc.  I have to say I disagree.  Vivid looking.  Sharp.  Doesn't seem to be overly noise reduced.  This is one of the best of the LEE and CUSHING team up movies and it's great to finally have a good looking version of it.  Early on there are a few day for night shots that someone seems to have forgotten to leave in the blue color that was intended.  But don't miss seeing this film.,1486080000,,433,4.083333333333333
