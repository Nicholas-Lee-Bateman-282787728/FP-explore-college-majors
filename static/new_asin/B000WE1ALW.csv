8222965,5,B000WE1ALW,"this movie theater of Rattingan's play has merit of having two major actors of England and it faithfull to original play. But somehow the other version for cinema - adapted by the author himself - is one of the best moments in cinema history, with a cast beyond any critic",1379548800,2,272,4.46
8222966,5,B000WE1ALW,"Director John Schlesinger, long celebrated for his work in big movies, wisely resisted the impulse to imitate the 1958 big-screen version of Sir Terence Rattigan's ""Separate Tables"" (starring David Niven and Deborah Kerr.) By choosing to give it the intimacy of a stage production, Schlesinger's film deftly captures the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Beauregard Hotel and the quiet desperation of its elderly residents.

Schlesinger also assembled a distinguished cast of chamber music perfection. Julie Christie, Alan Bates, and Claire Bloom turn in powerful performances of the major roles. The supporting players, from Irene Worth's portrayal of the insufferable Mrs. Railton-Bell, to Liz Smith's batty Miss Meachum, are pitch-perfect.

Having Schubert's Impromptu in G Flat as the only music is another masterstroke; aside from its being a beautiful piece, it's just the sort of music that would bring a smile to the face of Sylvia Barter's Lady Matheson. In contrast, the score for the 1958 movie is typical of the day -- the sort of over-produced, intrusive noise Bette Davis detested.

Perhaps the tortured relationship of Miss Shankland and John Malcolm is the stuff of the 1950s, and the offenses of Major Pollock wouldn't make the papers now, but there will always be people like Miss Cooper, Mr. Fowler, and Miss Meachum. I can't imagine why this film has not been released on DVD. At least the VHS version is still available.",1262131200,6,1440,5.225108225108225

It was well worth waiting for - as always, it was a treat to watch!  Anyone couldn't help but enjoy it, it's that kind of film.",1256774400,3,252,3.7358490566037736
