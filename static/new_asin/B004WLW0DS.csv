8445274,5,B004WLW0DS,"This was a diamond in the ruff for me. I bought it because I'm a fan of Noah Wyle, but it turned out to be a movie I like to watch again and again. It has it's comedy moments and romantic moments and moments of did she really just do that. It's a nice love triangle story that you soon realize isn't what it appears to be. A movie that is well done and well acted by all. A movie well worth getting.",1396742400,,399,3.819277108433735
8445275,4,B004WLW0DS,"The movie itself is fantastically written and has lots of good characters.
However the dvd-release lacks subtitles, which is slightly annoying to me, English not being my first language.",1328400000,,186,5.448275862068965
8445276,5,B004WLW0DS,"Tanna Frederick is an amazing actress with immediate access to all emotions whether it be deep and painful, hysterical and funny, ebullient or pensive, selfish or vulnerable. What a find. I hope more and more people become exposed to her and to Mr. Jaglom's complete body of film. I have been an admirer for many years and see each of his films. I am grateful to the Quad Cinema on West 13th Street for always taking a chance and hosting his films for longish periods of time. Recommend this and its prequel Hollywood Dreams, Last Summer in the Hamptons, any of his films starring Victoria Foyt such as BABY FEVER (another great actress more persons should know about). A personal favorite is FESTIVAL IN CANNES and ALWAYS.....BUT NOT FOREVER.  Give his work a chance.",1312761600,,768,4.731343283582089
