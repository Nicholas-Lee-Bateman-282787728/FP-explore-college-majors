7928477,5,B00004ZET2,"Bought this for the film with Lori Singer. Big fan of both Lori & Yo-Yo as cellists, and the 2 of them together is just magic to me :)

Been wanting to see this film for ages, and now that I can find dvd's ""like new"" in the used bin from Amazon sellers for a coupla bucks, I finally got it. For the $4 paid, I'm glad to have it :)

Not so fond of the dance piece but I suppose for people who like dance, it is interesting. My opinions of these particular dances wouldn't matter, I'm not a dance geek, so really have no basis to criticize from. :) But even for an ignoramus  like me, there are some really nice parts to watch.

This is a must-have for fans of any element of this work, whether you're interested in Yo-Yo Ma, Lori Singer, Atom Egoyan, Mark Morris, Dance, Cello, Bach, Humans, etc :) Worth the cost and under-noticed.",1351296000,,831,4.142857142857143
7928478,5,B00004ZET2,"Falling Down Stairs is my favorite of the series. I love the intimate look at the creative process of the artists and dancers. Truly inventive, intense, and even funny at times. Wonderful. Worth repeated watching.",1250208000,,213,5.114285714285714
7928479,1,B00004ZET2,"Pretentious, self-indulgent, superficial.  Ma is a great cellist, but this dvd tries to make him stretch to places he should attempt as a musician, not an actor.  Listen to Rostropovich for profundity.  This is mere fluff.  Some producer really fell down the stairs on this one",1188691200,4,277,4.956521739130435
7928480,5,B00004ZET2,As a dancer I found this DVD a true inspiration.  Yo-Yo Ma's gentle  manner and love of the creative soul in all of us is seen through both short movies.  Mark morris is exquisite in capturing in movement the core of flowing gentleness and playfulness of Bach as played by Yo-Yo Ma. An awesome experience in sight and sound!,1180137600,3,324,4.4576271186440675
7928481,1,B00004ZET2,"Yo-Yo Ma is a wonderful cellist.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not showcase his talent but is hijacked by self-indulgent ""filmmakers"" who think we are interested in Mark Morris' artistic angst as he struggles through choreograpic rehearsals complete with four-letter expletives.  Yo-Yo is talked-over background music in much ""Falling Down Stairs,"" which reminded me of the bumper sticker: ""Humpty Dumpty was pushed.""  I deposited the DVD in the trash before finishing ""Sarabande.""",1163376000,7,481,5.746478873239437
