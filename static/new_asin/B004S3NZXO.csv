8497585,4,B004S3NZXO,"Watched  this film with my 7 years old son. The story is simple and my son even learns coupes Chinese words, since the child actors'  talk  slower.
Story is telling the children to get alone and protect the animals and very good for the kids who are learning  Chinese and they will enjoy it and really learn many Chinese.",1301529600,2,321,4.389830508474576
