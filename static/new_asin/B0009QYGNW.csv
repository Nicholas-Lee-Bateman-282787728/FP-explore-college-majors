It's surprising that LP allowed this DVD to be made and released, especially considering the generally informative and well made releases they have in the marketplace.
When viewed after a well put together and enjoyable tutorial like Luis Conte's 'Studio Percussionist` you soon realise what a waste of time Bashiri's effort is.
Very disappointing!",1226707200,2,557,5.2
8065403,1,B0009QYGNW,"Either I completely misunderstood the target audience, or I'm a lot better at hand percussion than I thought! The percussion ""techniques"" on this DVD were about as basic/minimal as it gets. And I thought I was supposed to be gaining access to some ""inside info""!

It looks to me like the ""author"" of this work (Bashiri Johnson) really seems to be much more comfortable as a stick (kit?) percussion player, and he really didn't exhibit much skill as a hand drummer (no traditional hand techniques such as slaps, no ""standard"" afro/cuban conga patterns such as tumbao, calypso, bolero, etc).

I really feel that my money was misspent on this product. So far the best investment I have made in video hand percussion instruction is the Kalani ""Ultimate Conga/Bongo Jam"" series; these DVDs are much more informative and useful for those who are qualified to swim in anything deeper than the kiddie pool!",1198972800,,898,4.901315789473684
8065404,2,B0009QYGNW,"This DVD didn't give me what I was looking for.  The DVD seem to promote his CD rather than teach contemparary music rhythms.  I felt that Luis Conte's ""Studio Percussionist"" was a much better learning DVD.  Also, ""Adventures in Rhythm"" was pretty good, but keep your remote close because he moves fast.",1172102400,2,303,4.788461538461538
