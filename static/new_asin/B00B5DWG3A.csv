8562868,3,B00B5DWG3A,A sweet and silly little throwaway Brit miniseries.  All the characters were trying hard to be quirky which makes none of them really stand out.  All and all not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon but I won't remember any of this series tomorrow.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing.,1503100800,,287,4.377358490566038

Well, I bought the Sugartown miniseries on DVD because as a Brit now living in the USA, this is mostly how I get to watch british shows.

The cast is amazing. Shaun Dooley, Tom Ellis, and Sue Johnson. It had to be a decent watch..esp if Sue was in it. Right?

It's set in a cute seaside town. Life's pretty sugar coated until the black sheep of the family, the 'other' brother, returns to town to lay claim on his share of the rock ( rock is a hard candy and is a typical seaside sugary treat similar to the popularity of having Taffy by the seaside in America) and sweets/candy factory in Sugartown. He's also there to open a strip bar. NICE. And he has bigger plans for the town.  We've got  brother's battling for a company and then, it seems, also the same woman. Along the way, all kinds of family secrets get spilled.

The premise is fine. The actors were super good. But where it lost me was with the the God-awful dance montages. Seriously. They are bad. And the music is corny and unfitting. Without that, this would have been a four star series for me. And yes, ordinarily I love a good chick-flick or dance movie. The dancing just wasn't up to par, though.

But what really lets Sugartown down is the ending. It made no sense. Now, obviously I'm not going to dish up what the ending was - no spoilers - but I will say this; her decision had no basis or backbone to it and totally went against her character.

I can only hope this is the start of an actually series, and that this was just the set-up. In which case, I can see why they'd end it the way they did. To cause conflict and banter for future episodes. Otherwise, the writers really let the side down on this. As did the choreographers. Perhaps that's what happens when you select actors who can't dance and you expect them to learn. Yeah, some folk just don't have musicality. Or the ability to even move without looking like a SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE failure.

All in all, it was a typical cute British seaside story that could have done without the dancing and bad soundtrack. It was a light comedy trying to be something it wasn't; a dance movie.",1368835200,2,2241,4.291469194312796
8562874,4,B00B5DWG3A,"Zany. Scatterbrained. Misfits. But they all belong to Sugartown, home of the struggling but famous rock candy factory owned by brothers Jason (Shaun Dooley), who wants to save both factory and town, and Max, who initiates a take-over to convert the factory to a casino. Jason pops the question to Emily (Miranda Raison- MI-5), who has a lusty past with Max (Tom Ellis- The Passion). Master plot 2. Emily's dad is Sugartown Mayor, a hippie stuck in the 1960s, played by Philip Jackson, better known as Insp. Jap of Poirot TV legend. He plays a weird part well.

Added romances and secret complications come from other characters. `Sam' (Sally Dexter- also co-writer of this production), an ex-bunny dancer, cohort with Max of casino world, is joined in that effort by daughter Carmen (Georgia King- Little Dorrit), who's on-and-off with the local blowfly, rickshaw driver, Travis. The save-the-candy supporters include worker Margery (Sue Johnston- Clatterford & Little Dorrit) & Anne (Juliet Cowan). Ample seasoned cast to pull off the quirks of Sugartown.

SDH SUBTITLES optional for 3 episodes, but best watched back-2-back as a 3 hour feature. The plot thickens and twists during the series. Relationships crack like peanut brittle, secrets as sticky as taffy. Some spontaneous dance segments are fun, reminiscent of Mama Mia! Master plot 3 is the discovery that Sugartown was once a renowned dance hot-spot, as in Rave, FAME. Energetic music adds, but the costuming and set wallpaper looks like charity shop finds. Perfect for Mayor Ron and sad-case Anne but a bit over the top.

You will laugh, you will groan, you will cheer, you may even dance while viewing.",1363305600,3,1665,5.069343065693431
