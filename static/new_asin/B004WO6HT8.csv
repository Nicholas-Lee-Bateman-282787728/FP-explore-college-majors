4487803,5,B004WO6HT8,"Harry Potter books changed my life. I only read non fiction, sci-fi  and young adult books for the most part. Sometimes a gothic or mystery, but the plot is always the same. I always know what will happen. The plot in the Harry Potter series...mprphs. The extremely loveable characters, surroundings, language, animals and moralality make it unstoppable.  The detail and completeness satisfies the most analytical of readers. Being Christian, I do not find the series offensive. I recommend for all ages.

So what did I start reading after Harry Potter? Fantasy! Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffery, Tolkein, Christopher Paolini, and many other I can't recall. Recently to R. A. Salvatore (high violence). All amazing authors.

My favorite author all around is Orson Scott Card. I have been reading his works since Ender's Game 1985. Read them all (except Alvin Maker series). He is the most genius of all for storytellling.",1395878400,,917,5.134228187919463
4487804,5,B004WO6HT8,"If you are a Harry Potter movie fan and do not require extra discs full of special features this could be the deal you want. For half the price of a single Blu Ray you get two discs, in this case Years 5 and 6, Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince. My copies are very good quality, both visual and sound, playing on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-BDP-S1100/dp/B00AWX6EYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony BDP-S1100</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JBL-Cinema-SB100-Soundbar/dp/B009AZSYC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JBL Cinema SB100 Soundbar</a>. These are more than likely repackaged from earlier unsold HP Blu Ray editions, as the Half-Blood disc in mine states ""Disc 1 Movie,"" which to me indicates it was from a 2-disc set, with Disc 1 being the movie and Disc 2 the special features. While Half-Blood contains no special features due to this there are some special features on the Phoenix disc, as it was evidently not part of an earlier set. But that, of course, has no effect on the movie itself, which was the reason for my purchase, so for me is a non-issue. If you only want the movie and any special features are a bonus (as your discs may or may not be the same as mine) this is a very good deal. In case you are wondering, this set offered here offers no UV or digital copies, just the discs. My 5-star rating is based on the movies themselves, as well as the great price and quality provided.",1391040000,10,1517,5.351464435146443
4487805,5,B004WO6HT8,these are both great films. There is a lot that was left out of the books but that is expected. I bought this set from a local Walmart and it included ultraviolet copies and was $13. I  had read reviews that the quality wasn't good for Blu-ray  but I haven't noticed because I  watch  the ultraviolet  versions which are  fantastic,1371427200,,331,4.433333333333334
4487806,5,B004WO6HT8,"I have really enjoyed the entire collection. Fantasy, suspense, drama, and comedy all rolled into one throughly enjoyable series. I'm generally not interested in witchcraft type films, The Harry Potter movies are an exception. They are more about good vs evil, and  friendship. The ""witches and wizards"" aspect is portrayed in a more harmless manner.  It is a fantasy, as opposed  to horror movie.",1368748800,,397,5.171875

4487814,5,B004WO6HT8,"My kids have really started getting into the whole Harry Potter stories so we only had the first few and kids were so disappointed.  I am very happy we ordered this one as it's very exciting and we have already watched both and now I have to order the last one.  My kids even went so far as to ask for the book series.  My kids are 9 & 11 so we JUST recently let them watch it as we didn't want to scare them.  They both have been fine watching them along with us.  They come home from school asking to watch them and we have had to start and stop at different points in order to make bedtime, but even watching it again for hubby and myself we still enjoy it sooo much!  Kiddo's have decided to be Harry Potter characters for Halloweens so I have a feeling that our house will be filled with Harry Potter stuff for a while.",1476662400,,824,4.024539877300613

4487839,1,B004WO6HT8,"When I bought this Blu-Ray Double Feature I was expecting two Blu-Ray versions of Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. What I got instead was what seems to be a Blu-Ray version of HP & OOTP. THBP is definitely not Blu-Ray quality. It seems more like someone pirated it and loaded it on a DVD. It plays completely different than my other HP double features, and is a much lower picture quality, and horrible sound quality. The sound quality sounded more like it was coming from an ordinary set of TV speakers instead of my surround sound. No bass and no details. The difference is obvious just from playing OOTP and then playing HBP. I am returning this immediately.",1422576000,3,714,4.5859375
