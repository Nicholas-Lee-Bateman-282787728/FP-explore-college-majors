4902538,3,B005XB8SWI,"George Sanders, on loan from 20th Century-Fox, went from being The Saint to being The Falcon in RKO Radio Pictures' 1940s B-movie mystery series. Some legal magilla between The Saint author and studio killed that series. Then The Falcon came along, but there isn't a great deal of difference between the fictional characters as portrayed by Sanders. He wanted out to take advantage of juicier A-budget film roles. In ""The Falcon's Brother,"" Sanders agreed to appear briefly to smooth the transition so his actual brother Tom Conway could take over the role. The seven films in this three-disc set are fast-paced and enjoyable. I like the films but not the media. The set was pre-ordered, which means they were not mass-produced but on-demand DVD-R discs, not always a solid media. Disc two had several frame freezes and pixel distortion in occurring in two of the movies. Columbia has also begun releasing their B-movies on over-priced on demand DVD-R discs. You pays your dime (in this case too many) and you takes your chance. Some you win, some you lose.",1325635200,12,1057,4.910614525139665
4902539,1,B005XB8SWI,"I was excited about the new release of the Saint and Falcon Collections from WB, but, they blew it when it comes to quality with these DVD's, especially the Falcon Collection. Terrible! to say the least. Now Amazon is charging $40.00 for the Falcon Collection, when it originally sold for $26.00.",1325462400,15,296,4.823529411764706
4902540,3,B005XB8SWI,"George Sanders once referred to these films as ""slices of cinematic cheese."" He had already done a tour of duty as The Saint and wanted out. The studio killed off his character Gay Lawrence and replaced him with his brother Tom. Sanders real brother Tom Conway took over. These films are okay, but a little heavy on the broad comic relief. One critic has written ""you long for mystery relief from the comedy.""",1325116800,,409,4.616438356164384
4902541,3,B005XB8SWI,"I've seen these movies many times and love them all. But I must very reluctantly agree with other reviewers these are mediocre prints of very, very good 40's detective movies. From WB yet!  I was hoping for some outstanding cleaned up and stabilized discs. No such luck. Not much more to say. Oh yes...keep your packaging material there was only one disc in the box (yes they shorted me a disc, I can't believe the sloppiness, as I said...from WB yet!!). Well I won't be buying any more that look and feel like this rendition. I wonder if they outsourced the manufacture and the OEM just doesn't care?",1324771200,88,601,4.564814814814815
4902542,5,B005XB8SWI,"I have loved the old Falcon movies since the days of the late late show on TV- long before the VCR!  I did eventually get a couple of the Falcon films on VHS tape over the years but I really wanted a DVD collection, which I found about a year ago on an internet search (can't remember the name of the site!)  The set is 6 DVD's and seems to include all of the Sanders/Conway films (from 1941 to 1946) but then there are 3 more!  Two in 1948 (Devil's Cargo, which has nothing to do with ships, or devils, or cargo... and  Appointment with Murder) and one in 1949 (Search for Danger ).  None of these star either Sanders or Conway, but rather John Calvert as Michael ""The Falcon"" Waring.  One has Roscoe Karns as a police lieutenant, and Lyle Talbot is in at least two of them.  They are very strange.  This Falcon is nothing like the Lawrence brothers.  In one he does magic tricks!  And has a dog!  The action seems to take place in Los Angeles.  On the whole it is a very strange experience.  The best part of the set is that it DOES include ALL of the Lawrence brothers Falcon films, at least as far as I can tell there are no more out there.  I hope the Amazon people put out set two soon.  If you can't wait, do a search.  This one might still be out there.  Oh, and Harriet Hilliard is in the one with Tom when he goes out to the country to find out who is stealing war bonds!!  Wendy Barrie is in a couple with George Sanders.  She is cute!",1324598400,4,1446,4.0638297872340425
4902543,4,B005XB8SWI,"It could be, we all need The Falcon to save us from disaster. Well, he's here in seven second features, of variable quality, but not enjoyment. And, there are two Falcons. George Sanders and his brother, Tom Conway. Conway was more reserved, more handsome, and despite Sanders' superior career, more The Falcon. The dvd set of three is well presented. For those of us who remember...

Further Thought: No sticking problems.",1323907200,14,423,4.957746478873239
4902544,3,B005XB8SWI,"I pre-ordered this the moment I saw it offered,and,for the most part,was quite happy with this release.
Being a grumpy you know what,though,I must complain about the drawbacks.
Warner archives is charging full DVD prices for no frills DVD-R releases that have absolutely no extras and can't even bother to put a Falcon themed menu on the discs,either.
A static shot of the Warner Bros. lot is on all these archive discs.
The retail price of $44.99 is outrageous for DVD-R and I wouldn't have touched it if not for the much more reasonable Amazon price.
The discs are also not burned very well.
Disc one and two are dual layer (disc 3 has only one film,so I assume it is a DVD 5)and have scratches and also show signs of being burned at multiple speeds,which can sometimes cause playback problems.
Is there even any quality control on these archive discs,or do they crank them out as fast as humanly possible?
Three of the seven films have 'sticking' problems when played back-one slight,the other two quite bad.
I am debating whether returning it will solve the problem,or just give me more badly burned discs.
The picture quality and sound are pretty good but I don't think these were remastered like many of the archive releases are.
The films are all good fun,but slightly repetitive.
Both the Lawrence brothers(George Sanders is Gay Lawrence and Tom Conway is his brother Tom Lawrence)are quite the ladies' man(or is that men)and are constantly paying too much attention to all beautiful woman who cross their paths.
They seem to always have a steady girlfriend/fiance who goes nuts over these attentions for comedic effect.
It can get a little old to an enlightened 21st century guy (I'm actually just jealous)but these are a product of their time.
He always has an ex-con assistant/helper/lackey/whatever to assist(they are of great assistance sometimes and always loyal),or more likely,provide comic relief.
""I heard you were incarcerated.""
""I haven't touched a drop!"" --is the kind of relief I'm talking about.
The Falcon is always being framed for someone's murder (or other crime in conjunction) and has to prove his innocence.
Sanders is a charming cad but still comes across as likable,but I have to say,I prefer Conway as the Falcon.
George Sanders will always be the Saint to me,not the Falcon.
Tom Conway gets short shrift here in this set,as he is not featured on the cover art or on any of the disc art.
George Sanders is fully in the first three films but is barely in the fourth,when he hands over the reins of the series to his on screen (and off screen) brother Tom Conway(who is fully in 4 of the 7 films).
Sanders exit from the series was badly done,In my opinion.
I think the later films in this set were done better than the first ones,and the Falcon and the Co-eds was my favorite of the bunch(of course,I couldn't really watch two of them because of the sticking problem).
Tom Conway was always seemingly waiting in the wings to replace someone.
He replaced Basil Rathbone on the Sherlock Holmes radio series,Vincent Price on the Saint radio series and even his own brother on the Falcon movies.
Anyone wanting plot synopsis of these films individually can always go to IMDB for details,I'm just giving a heads up on this DVD release,not the films themselves.
Here is hoping they release the remaining six films in volume two as well as learn how to properly burn a stinkin' DVD correctly(8x or 12x for DVD 5,2.4x or 4x for DVD 9 as anything faster can produce errors,especially on an older burner).
Tom will at least get featured on volume two's cover.",1323734400,142,3580,4.766505636070853

4902577,5,B005XB8SWI,"OK, I freely admit that I have a mania for the old mystery movies from the 30's with a serial character - The Falcon, Boston Blackie, Charlie Chan, The Saint, Mr. Moto and Mr. Wong.  I finally got around to picking this set up to fill in my collection.  There is just something about George Sanders in the Falcon and The Saint.  For those who take the time to give him a chance, he really was one of a kind in these roles.  Rakish just seems to be the perfect word for his performance in these series.  His brother fills in admirably well, when he took over the Falcon role.  If you like these old movies, add them to your list.

4902609,3,B005XB8SWI,"I have been buying Warner Bros. archive DVDs for a while now. I have never had a problem with the discs...until ordering this one.  This Falcon series Vol. 1 has 7 movies, the problem was with disc 2 where 3 of these films are squeezed into one disc.  First of all - quality suffers when more than 2 features are put on 1 disc, my problem was with FALCON STRIKES BACK, at a certain point, the picture 'froze', then jumped a few chapters ahead and continued.  I thought my player must need a head cleaning.....but I played the disc on 2 other DVD players I have - and sure enough - the same problem in the same spot on each player - - so it is the disc, without question.
Companies should NEVER squeeze 3 features on 1 disc!  Blank discs cost 'pennies' wholesale, it does not cost much to include an extra disc in a set - especially at these 'archive' retail prices!
In the first place it was very THOUGHTLESS of this company to even do this since the 3rd disc in the set had only one movie on it!!!
Disc 3 had ONLY 'Falcon & the Co-Eds' - It could have been easy to have 2 films on disc 2 (Falcon's Brother & Falcon Strikes Back) and 2 on the 3rd disc (Falcon In Danger & Falcon & Co-Eds)  Would have been nice to see trailers too!

They had good story lines (some better than others) and a brash, cool, charming, and witty detective called ""The Falcon"" who spent half his time solving mysteries and the other half avoiding the law. It seems the cops always suspected him of something even though they had no proof he had done anything wrong. In the end, they would grudgingly admit that he had solved the crime but that didn't let him off the hook. He MUST have done SOMETHING wrong, damn it!  Oh well, that's just the way the police were perceived at that time.

4902683,5,B005XB8SWI,"There is a mood, a time, a type, by which we classify a story. Whether the story is drawn penned, or filmed, the idea runs parallel. ""The Falcon"" can be seen by today's viewer as second-class pap and therefore unworthy of his time; or it can be seen as B fare was meant to be seen, even at the time of its creation--for fun. Sanders and Conway have all the fun and it's at the expense of their supporting casts. The dialogue is clever--damned clever--and far better than the tripe that passes for dialogue these days. The plots are knitted well and the actors are skilled. The direction and the crew are solid, as well, and the writers run no shortages of wit and badinage. To many, it's the aging of a movie which gives it another layer of enjoyment: the old cars, the manner of dress, and yes, the customs which marked our by-gone society. If one has no idea, let's say, of Victorian manners, one can't quite take the right spirit from P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster. In the instance of ""The Falcon,"" much the same might be said. It helps to adore old movies and all that went into them to love these gems--at least half as much as I.",1368144000,3,1141,4.36150234741784

4902709,4,B005XB8SWI,"Has any other actor exuded more of that aura of jaded ennui? In 1941, George Sanders, having had his fill of the halo, jettisoned the Saint in favor of another gentleman sleuth, the Falcon. Note that the Falcon, much like the Saint, is a man of the world and favors that air of worldly sophistication. And, like the Saint, the Falcon doesn't think twice about circumventing the law when he deems it necessary. As Gayl0rd Laurence, alias the Falcon, Sanders would star in four installments, with the fourth one co-starring his real-life brother Tom Conway who then plays his cinematic brother, Tom Laurence. In that same movie - THE FALCON'S BROTHER - Sanders, tired of the role, would cede the franchise to Conway. Conway would rapidly make the Falcon sobriquet his own, to the tune of ten Falcon pictures (including THE FALCON'S BROTHER). Conway doesn't mimic Sanders' affectations. Instead, he establishes his Falcon persona as equally capable and witty and chivalrous, only more down-to-earth.

Except that only the first four of Conway's Falcon flicks would be showcased in this DVD collection. As such, THE FALCON MYSTERY MOVIE COLLECTION Volume 1 - in all its 3-disc glory - presents seven Falcon mysteries. These capers, widely regarded as fun little B-pictures and bustling with comic banter, motor along at a good clip, each running over an hour, but barely. For what it's worth, all three discs played fine for me. But it sucks that there aren't any bonus features.

Give this a chance. It's a good way to pass the time on those lazy weekends when you just want to stay home. Thrill to the exploits of these two dashing adventurers as they mingle in high and low society, righting wrongs and chasing dames and solving crimes that confound them plodding flatfoots, after which they proceed to chase even more dames. If you haven't guessed it yet, the Laurence siblings have got them wandering eyes. One of the running gags persistently trotted out is the close-out scene in which the Falcon, having solved the case and once more sworn off women and whodunits, is approached by a gorgeous damsel-in-distress begging for his help. This happens time and again, not that I ever got tired of the Falcon's weakness consistently exploited.

Not included in this set are Tom Conway's further escapades as the Falcon: THE FALCON OUT WEST, THE FALCON IN MEXICO, THE FALCON IN HOLLYWOOD, THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, THE FALCON'S ALIBI, AND THE FALCON'S ADVENTURE. I sense a Volume 2 in the offing.

- THE GAY FALCON (1941, 66 minutes)

First in the franchise, THE GAY FALCON immediately sets the tone. We learn that, after many death-defying scrapes, Gay Laurence has finally retired from a career of ""crime solutions."" He's given up the fast life and taken to drinking spinach juice. He's promised his fianc&eacute;e to settle down as a humdrum investment broker on Wall Street. But it's an ephemeral vow. You cannot tame this Falcon, especially not when a pretty young thing (Wendy Barrie) shows up at his home and pleads for his help. Barrie plays mystery enthusiast and - let's not kid ourselves - Falcon groupie, Helen Reed. From jump we expect her to pretty much throw a wrench in the Falcon's engagement to the snooty Elinor, and we're not disappointed. The mystery involves the theft of a diamond ring and a society murder during a posh soiree. When that lone pistol shot rings out, the Falcon is transported back into his element.

It's a fast-moving puzzle with an unexpected culprit, but I'm struck more with how strongly the tone echoes the screwball comedy, thanks to Barrie's turn as a ditzy dame, a clear departure from her more somber interpretations in THE SAINT. This is the first of two appearances Wendy Barrie would make in the Falcon series, and, unlike her three stints in the Saint movies, she plays the same character both times here. Meanwhile, Allen Jenkins is a hoot as the Falcon's street-savvy assistant, Jonathan ""Goldy"" Locke. He wiseacres his way thru three Falcon pictures.

When the murder goes down at the fancy dinner party, I love the clever way the Falcon ensures he wouldn't get caught with that incriminating bauble on him.

- A DATE WITH THE FALCON (1942, 63 minutes)

The shoe's on the other foot. Helen Reed (Wendy Barrie) is now the Falcon's fianc&eacute;e and must deal with his roving eye and penchant for landing in sticky situations. Gay Laurence is due to fly out to meet Helen's parents and get hitched when he's enticed by the local police inspector (a gruff James Gleason) to aid in the search for an abducted scientist who'd figured out a formula for making flawless synthetic diamonds. When the Falcon sets himself up as bait, it's up to his surly assistant ""Goldy"" Locke to swoop in and save the day. But maybe he bungles it.

It's a bit jarring to see such a shift in Barrie's character - the formerly easy-going Helen Reed has essentially transformed into the frazzled Elinor of the first Falcon feature - although Helen does retain a semblance of what made her such a good sport in her first appearance. But, no, the future Mrs. Laurence isn't too enthused that there's yet another intriguing femme fatale mixed up in the Falcon's latest predicament.

- THE FALCON TAKES OVER (1942, 63 minutes)

When a beefy ex-con and -wrestler is implicated in a string of snapped neck murders, the Falcon (who is still engaged) and aspiring reporter Ann Riordan (Lynn Bari) are on the case and soon stumbling over jade necklaces and psychic rackets. James Gleason (as Inspector O'Hara) and Allen Jenkins (as ""Goldy"" Locke) are in for one last go-around. Touting its noir pedigree, THE FALCON TAKES OVER is based on Raymond Chandler's FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. This is an odd curio piece, what with George Sander's flippant amateur detective, with his old world charms, standing in for the hard-boiled Philip Marlowe. These are two very different sorts of gumshoes. 1944's MURDER, MY SWEET and 1975's FAREWELL, MY LOVELY are both darker and cling closer to the spirit of Chandler's novel.

- THE FALCON'S BROTHER (1942, 63 minutes)

A passing of the torch. When Gay's brother, Tom - whom Gay hadn't seen in over five years - is murdered on a ship sailing from South America, the Falcon snoops around, never mind that the corpse identified as ""Tom Laurence"" isn't really him. But when Gay is rendered incapacitated, the real Tom Laurence (Tom Conway) steps in and ferrets out a German spy ring hidden in the fashion industry. Conway smoothly slides into the Falcon role, although I wish Sanders gets more of a send-off.

- THE FALCON STRIKES BACK (1943, 66 minutes)

When the new Falcon is persuaded to help ""an exotic little tomato"" find her missing brother, he gets coshed on the skull and wakes up framed for the murder of a bank messenger and the theft of war bonds worth $250,000. Going on the lam, he holes up in a mountain resort and unearths a shady war bond racket. Jane Randolph returns as reporter Marcia Brooks. Cliff Edwards steps in as ""Goldy"" Locke, except that he's no Allen Jenkins, doesn't have Jenkins' inspired nervous antics. It's universal knowledge that puppet shows, like clowns, are potentially creepy, but who would suspect sinister doings in the offices of the Volunteer Knitters of America? The dim bulb coppers, as usual, act more like walking meat slabs with badges pinned on.

- THE FALCON IN DANGER (1943, 70 minutes)

Howls the newspaper headline: ""Police baffled by gremlins!"" Two industrialists and their pilot vanish while in mid-flight, along with $100,000 in securities. Except the Falcon doesn't think it's gremlins at all. He just may be able to crack this case wide open, if only he can keep his bumbling Southern belle fianc&eacute;e (Amelita Ward) from getting underfoot.

- THE FALCON AND THE CO-EDS (1943, 68 minutes)

When a possibly insane college clairvoyant prophesies yet another professor's murder at the Bluecliff Seminary for Young Ladies, the Falcon is lured in. There's a fair chance that THE FALCON AND THE CO-EDS may be the best entry in the franchise. Plonking the Falcon in girls-only academia breathes rollicking life into the series. The plot veers away from that old, stale Falcon formula. I don't know that the mystery is all that involving, but I relished the balancing the film does, alternating its tone from breezy to hauntingly atmospheric. In the conservative halls of Bluecliff, Tom Laurence encounters a bevy of beautiful co-eds, a faculty teeming with skulking educators, a disturbed psychic, and the utterly delightful trio of young sisters known as ""the Ughs."" That's a lot of womenfolk and a lot of swooning over the debonair Falcon. Some of the film's best bits: The three Ughs' performing of a swing number that's reminiscent of the Andrew Sisters and - Shades of Hitchcock! - the Falcon's being mistaken for a renowned psychologist and forced to deliver an on-the-spot lecture. In the end, one of the Ughs gets the last word in, gazing at the departing Falcon and producing a pre-adolescent sigh: ""He fixed the horn. He solved the murder. He can do anything.""",1338163200,14,9075,4.876703439325113

The prints themselves are from 35mm transfers, in fact they are the same prints used on TCM. I recorded the series off of TCM a few years back, and compared them to the Warners version. They are the same prints. So we have the same collection used for TV broadcast. A quick note on the freezing issues some folks are having. I played all three discs without any issues. However, these are dual layer discs which can be very sensitive sometimes. Before you return the dics as being defective you should try two things. First, get a DVD player cleaning disc. The one offered by Maxell is good. If the laser head becomes dirty or worn it will not read the signal and can cause freezing or skipping. Second, try playing them on another DVD player.

4902714,1,B005XB8SWI,"I was initially excited to see this (and the companion release, the Saint films with George Sanders) - they really are great fun from a bygone era of clever and classy, low-key mystery movies - but I groaned out loud when I saw that they were not just DVD-R junk, but dual-layer DVD-R junk at that.  Warner should know that the many true fans already have DVD-R's (made from TV broadcasts) of all of these films, and based on the one Warner Archive DVD-R I've seen, homemade DVD-R's are hands-down better than the ones Warner is trying to sell - for one thing, it's been my experience that homemade DVD-R's will play on any device, while Warner's DVD-R's seem to play only in dedicated DVD players of the type one hooks up to a television.  Truly, Warner - like Sony, Sears Craftsman, etc., amazes me with their moronic quest for brand dilution by making junk rather than quality products befitting their good name.  I know something of the DVD business, and I assure you that they are saving pretty close to nothing by making DVD-R's rather than properly pressed DVD'S, yet nevertheless they choose to cheapen their name by doing so!  Indeed, as far as I'm concerned, the entire Warner Archive series is a massive marketing failure: scores of films that I would buy in an instant if they were proper DVDs offered at a reasonable price, yet don't buy because they are slip-shod DVD-R's offered at what seem to me high prices considering the product.  This is my stand, Warner: offer proper, pressed DVD's and I'll gladly buy; continue to offer DVD-R's  and I won't.",1330473600,97,1565,4.6521739130434785

Warner put no effort in trying to clean the films themselves. They should have taken a cue from MPI's release of the Rathbone Holmes or Fox's release of the Oland/Toler Chans. Fox also did a spectacular job of including Chan-related documentaries on each disc (There were about twenty of them). I wish the Monogram Chan releases were as nicely presented.
