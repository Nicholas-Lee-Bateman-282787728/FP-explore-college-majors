Evangelization, however, comes more difficult for many of us. For whatever reason, many Catholics find it challenging to talk about the way the Lord is working in their lives, whether they're speaking with family members, friends, colleagues, neighbors, or complete strangers.
It just got easier. My friend and sister in Christ Nancy Ward at JoyAlive.net is stepping out in faith with a new DVD, Sharing YOUR Faith Story. In addition to her own stories of renewal and conversion, Nancy provides ten tips for sharing your story. I was especially struck by her three suggestions for beginning to develop your story: Who were you before? What happenedwas it a decisive moment, or a gradual awakening? Who are you now? It reminded me anew that storytelling was one of Jesuss best evangelization tools, telling us parables about how peoples hearts, souls, or bodies were suffering and then healed by the Lords love and mercy. Its much more effective than judging people and telling them that in your less-than-humble opinion, they're headed straight to hell.

For me, telling my faith story comes easy, perhaps because writing and speaking are among my gifts and because the Lord blessed me with numerous people, Catholic and non-Catholic, who were open with their journeys as I struggled to find my way back to the Church after an absence of more than thirty years. Its also made it easier to identify those continual moments of conversion in the ten years Ive been back and the wonderful people who have blessed me.

That said, for many of my friends, those moments are difficult to share. They seem too private, too personal. And yet, that is what we are called to do, to evangelize and bring souls to the Kingdom. Sharing our stories help to do that, and Nancys tips and advice on the DVD (also available in a seminar for your parish or group) show us all how to do that effectively.",1447545600,,1961,4.847761194029851
8733353,5,B015EXNW7A,"If the term evangelization sends you into a fit of either nerves or nausea, youll want to know all about Nancy Wards new project Sharing YOUR Faith Story. Nancy provides an enjoyable template for the challenge given to us in 1 Peter 3:15 to Always  be ready to give an explanation to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope, but do it with gentleness and reverence. Catholic convert, author and speaker Nancy HC Ward has a passion for evangelization. All baptized Christians have a unique story and all are meant to be evangelists. The most effective way to evangelize is through the faith story only we can tell. Her Sharing YOUR Faith Story seminar answers the question, How do I give my personal witness?

The Sharing YOUR Faith Story seminar came from Nancys heartfelt desire to share her conversion story, her renewal story and the ways she found joy in sharing those experiences that brought her closer to God. The DVD takes her live seminar and opens it to encompass anyone who recognizes the need to evangelize through personal witness.

Since conversion is a life-long calling, we can expect God to surprise us with little steps and big steps closer toward him, she said. I want to help as many people as possible learn to take these steps and always be ready to tell their unique story as only they can.

With the study guide As Nancy tells her conversion and renewal stories she demonstrates how to witness effectively and authentically. Then she addresses tips and cautions that also apply to stories of healings, miracles and answered prayers. The DVD is ideal for Catholic leaders of small or large gatherings, Bible studies, retreats, evangelization seminars and parish missions.",1447027200,,1701,4.835051546391752

Nancys gentle presentation motivates viewers to persevere in prayer and to listen to the encouragement of the Holy Spirit to discover and share their faith.

My favorite section of Nancys DVD is Part 3: 10 Tips for Sharing Your Faith Story. (Im all about tips!) She grounds these tips in Scripture:

But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. (1 Peter 3:15)",1446768000,,771,4.492857142857143
8733355,5,B015EXNW7A,"Faith: a very personal word stemming from a very personal relationship with God, resulting in an inability to clearly articulate just what it means to you. Sound familiar? Are you like so many people who steer clear from talking about religion, let alone your own personal faith, for fear of rejection, confrontation, or appearing ignorant? Fear no longer! Your faith sharing story is your story. No one else can write it and no one else can articulate it better than you. Easier said than done? I understand. Thats why I am excited to share with you a new DVD by my friend, Nancy Ward, titled, Sharing YOUR Faith Story DVD.

In this three part DVD, Nancy tells of her own conversion story (part 1), her renewal, or revitalization, of her faith (part 2), and tips on how you can best articulate your faith story at the next gathering you attend, without fearing rejection, confrontation, or appearing ignorant.

I found Nancys story of conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism very interesting. I found her renewal story, once through the Cursillo Movement, and again through the Life in the Spirit Charismatic Movement to be encouraging. I say encouraging because living the Catholic faith to the full requires a series of conversions, or renewals over a lifetime. Nancys sharing of her journey gives me encouragement that I, too, can get through the arid deserts of life and find renewal through the Holy Spirit. Nancys tips are the best for developing a sense of ease in sharing your own faith story.",1446768000,,1507,4.8828125
