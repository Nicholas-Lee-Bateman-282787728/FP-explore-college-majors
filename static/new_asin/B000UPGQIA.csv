2923759,5,B000UPGQIA,"This documentary avoids the politcal debate about the war in Iraq and concentrates on one of its most catastrophic results, not the death of young Americans as horrible as that is, but their maiming - loss of limbs, use of the brain because of injuries, sense of isolation - all in people so young. It is presented very effectively. I showed to young friends of mine and they were deeply affected.",1203811200,6,397,4.605633802816901
2923760,5,B000UPGQIA,This movie made me cry when I caught it on HBO.  It's eye opening and every single person living in this countries and those that knock it should watch this movie.,1203638400,2,163,4.258064516129032
2923761,5,B000UPGQIA,As the wife of a veteran who has served our country for more than 20 years I have seen and lived with the consequences of this war. My husband is about to leave his family again for another 18 month deployment.  Whether you support the war or not you should support the soldiers that help to provide you with your every day freedom.  This war is real and it has affected many people in many defferent ways.  This movies helps to show that-it brought tears to my eyes.  But it also made me proud to be an American and proud to be a part of a United States military family.  Tastefully done but real.  It makes you think twice about not sweating the small stuff......,1195948800,22,665,4.28
2923762,5,B000UPGQIA,"Every American should see this film. What you think of the war you need to see this film.  This is one of the most difficult films to watch, but you need to.  In a heated political debate, Alive Day Memories shows one of the most important views of the war and its aftermath.  Gandolfini is not the star, he is the audience, he is listening to the stories the same as you. There is no slant, no political agenda, this movie is about the soldiers, and helping those of us who have no idea, to understand just a little about them and what they are going through.  While we leave with only a glimpse, it igives you a new apprecation for the sacrifice they have made for our country. They truly represent the best in us all.",1189728000,18,720,4.233576642335766

2923777,5,B000UPGQIA,James Gandolfini was the perfect person for these brave vets to open up to. His real sensitivity and appreciation of our American veterans was ongoing through his lifetime. I am honored to hear their stories. I grieve deeply for their wounds.

And while it can't but help be moving -- with ten soldiers telling their stories of their slow recovery from war injuries, and some amazing, upsetting real footage of war, explosions, etc., its short running time (60 minutes) becomes  a real problem. 5 or 6 minutes just isn't enough time to really explore what it's like to come home without your legs, or with PTSD or will your brain partially shot away.

2923792,4,B000UPGQIA,"The dead can't say what happened in the war but those who survive the illegal, immoral American invasion and occupation of Iraq can, even if they do not come home in one piece. Listen to the words of ten such individuals in the 2007 documentary ALIVE DAY MEMORIES: HOME FROM IRAQ. As if the will to put themselves out there in battle was not enough, these fighting men and women sit to discuss the shell shock, blindness, amputations, and brain damage with which they came home from the war fought for lies.

The late James Gandolfini interviews those Iraq war veterans in ALIVE DAY MEMORIES. Three years later he would produce WARTORN, another superb documentary, on the topic of shell shock and other psychological effects of battle.

Before you let recruiters talk your son or daughter into enlisting, a double feature of ALIVE DAY MEMORIES and WARTORN (each is only about one hour) will raise some questions your child may not have thought to ask. My teen-ager viewed ALIVE DAY MEMORIES with me and asked, ""So, why did we go to Iraq?""

2923795,5,B000UPGQIA,"Incredible documentary that was heart-wrenching.  I couldn't watch it and couldn't look away at the same time.  I've shared with friends and family.  Originally I purchased it as training assistance for a MA in Counseling Program.  It provides incredible insights into both Veteran experiences and grief.  It's by no means a Counseling training video, but in terms of broadening understanding of human experience, I recommend it.",1400716800,,429,5.4393939393939394

This is not about whether Iraq was right or wrong, it is apolitical and I liked that.  It's just about our service members surviving, and I wish them all the luck in the world.

2923802,5,B000UPGQIA,"A very well-made documentary.  Very enlightening.  Good job at conveying the difficulties our wounded vets face when they return home.

The documentary is very sad seeing all the soldiers that had something happen to them if it's either losing a leg or arm or becoming mentally ill. It is also sad how you see the people with their hands, arms, or legs amputated. This documentary is a must see because it gives you second thought of joking the army and start telling veterans that they are baby killers. I don't really watch documentary's but this documentary is very heartbreaking. My least favorite part was seeing all the soldiers how they were.",1352937600,,622,4.513274336283186

2923807,5,B000UPGQIA,"This movie shows what throughout the ages veterans have been faced with when injured and then coming home to places where noone can relate to what they went through except other soldiers.  Today; we even have brave women in larger numbers coming back maimed and wondering if they are loved, the men feel this too, we should love these  people and thank them all, they fought for us. Kids need to see this movie so they can realize whats happening and happened to good people who fought in these wars. because many are just absorbed with pop culture without any knowledge of things other than  a  video game,  War is a nightmare , not a video game, when I was in the army a serving nam vet said to us ""I hate these glory songs that we sing marching , you fight for your friends and everyone with your uniform is a brother"" however this movie understands that these people are decent people who fought in spite of Dick Cheneys' corruption to make Iraq a better place.  Every high school classroom needs to see this , it brings it all home. War tears up the body and soul but some folks can come back. I would say that they needed to find a war victim who NOT the victim of a ied.  many wounded soldiers were hit in firefights and this aspect of the war is neglected here.  James Gandolfini really lends his insight into this , reading them and relating to these wonderful and brave vets, so he was a great choice for this flick.  rhe dvd looks great and is worth owning or renting.

The story of each individual in the documentary gets inside of your heart in such a way that it hurts because you begin to care about them as you learn the depth of their struggles and achievements. You get to know them as people, not just statistics or a news story quickly reported and quickly forgotten.

2923812,5,B000UPGQIA,"I have to admit that even though my husband fought in Desert Storm the impact of that war was nothing like the one our soldiers are fighting now. Interviewing soldiers that where permanently injured in the present Iraq war was sobering. I was so taken by the Marine who was brain damaged and all he could do was cuss and say simple phrases he remembered from being a Marine. He was completely paralyzed with the mind of a child. His ""cheerleader"" was his mother who honestly believed he would walk again and that his brain would heal itself. It was heartbreaking. I felt like I needed to hug the mother for her dedication not just to his care but for refusing to give up on her son. I also saw men and women who described how they lost their limbs, sight, or had Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome. We all owe these men so much and still I do not think we give them enough. Mr. Gandolfini was wonderful and compassionate to these veterans. I do not think anyone could have done a better job interviewing.",1223078400,11,1000,4.440217391304348

They have all been profoundly affected by their experience, both physically and emotionally.  They are living proof that war is hell, and a reminder of the tremendous sacrifice both they and their families make. I couldn't help but feel badly for these young people who have suffered such devastating physical and emotional wounds. Yet, their lives go on.
