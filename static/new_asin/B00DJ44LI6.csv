8593652,4,B00DJ44LI6,"WOW! With a title like ZOMBIES UN-BRAINED 12 FILM FLESH FEST, one might expect a horde of cannibalistic un-dead, munching on bloody victims. Instead, this is another collection of well-worn, public domain horror movies. CARNIVAL OF SOULS- A classic spooker, starring Candace Hilligoss as a woman who seems to survive a car crash, only to be plagued by odd occurrences, and visions of a group of ghouls at an abandoned carnival. Wonderfully grim and eerie!  DEAD MEN WALK- George Zucco plays a man haunted by his eeevil twin brother (Zucco again), who is a practitioner of the black arts, as well being a vampire! Co-stars the brilliant Dwight Frye (DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, THE VAMPIRE BAT) as his henchman! HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES- Those wicked Templar knights are up to no good again! This time, they menace some fashion models on board their Spanish galleon. If rickety, Wal-mart skeletons and bobbling toy boats don't bother you, then check this one out! HOUSE OF THE LIVING DEAD- Experiments in soul-transference lead to... boredom beyond belief! Nothing to see here! KING OF THE ZOMBIES- Very little zombie involvement, as a voodoo-practicing Nazi madman attempts to defeat the allies during WW2. Mantan Moreland co-stars as the only character w/ a functioning brain! THE LAST MAN ON EARTH- Vincent Price must battle zombie-vampires in this post-apocalyptic creeper. Features a nice, gloomy finale! MUTANT- A man (Wings Hauser- VICE SQUAD) finds himself in a small town, over-run by the gooshy humanoids of the title! Bo Hopkins co-stars as the beleaguered sheriff. Great bleak atmosphere throughout. OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES- Jess Franco film about Nazi zombies protecting a hidden treasure. Mindless mayhem ensues. THE SNAKE PEOPLE- More voodoo is afoot as Boris Karloff holds sway over a village. Watch for the ssslitheringly awesome exotic dancer Tongolele, as... well, pretty much herself! Also, watch for the cannibal girls! A priceless schlock-er! TEENAGE ZOMBIES- Don Sullivan (THE GIANT GILA MONSTER) and his friends are stranded on an island. Unfortunately, a maniacal woman (Katherine Victor) is creating zombies in her lab! Plus, there's a go-rilla! A Jerry Warren bilge-a-thon! WHITE ZOMBIE- Features Bela Lugosi as Murder Legendre, arguably his best role other than DRACULA. Murder is in command of an army of voodoo zombies, used as slaves in his sugar cane operation. There are some truly memorable scenes of lumbering zombies, as well as Lugosi's unforgettable stare! So, there it is. As long as you don't expect anything near to what the title promises, this isn't a bad collection...",1440892800,,2600,5.220095693779904

8593654,5,B00DJ44LI6,"Mill Creek has again put out a neat theme package of movies.  In this case, the ever popular ZOMBIE!!!!  Yes they slice!  They dice!  They even Julian Their Brains!!!!
  With the current trend, this was put out at the perfect time.  With World War Z & AMC's the Walking Dead popular, why not some of the older greats that helped get the genre going.  Like one of the originals ""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi (the movie that gave Rob Zombie's band their name).  To ""The Last Man On Earth"" with Vincent Price (It spawned remakes with Charlton Heston in The Omega Man & I Am Legend With Will Smith). To ""Night Of The Living Dead"", the literal ""Godfather"" of ALL Zombie films.
  This is a GREAT set to purchase.  Love it!",1405123200,,718,4.396946564885496

8593656,3,B00DJ44LI6,"The ratings-hit AMC's The Walking Dead returns tomorrow night with its fourth season, but zombies have crawled their way onto screens way before the comic-flesh-eating-fueled way before the original comic book printed. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released a 12 film flesh fest on a 3-disc set titled Zombies Unbrained, featuring masters of horror Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.

The films on the 3-disc set are:

  Carnival of Souls (1962) - This eerie film matches some of the best Twilight Zone episodes. Filmed in three weeks, the movie centers around Mary Henry is a solo-survivor of a drag race, which her friends plunged to their deaths in a river. To get over the tragedy, she takes a job as an organist at a Church in Utah, but before long strange occurrences begin and she begins to believe she is being stalked by a mysterious man. She doesn't know that death is coming for her!

  Dead Men Walk (1943) - Dr. Lloyd Clayton murdered his twin brother Elwyn in self-defense, but Elwyn returns from the dead as a vampire.

  Horror of the Zombies (1974) - This movie is the USA public domain version of The Ghost Galleon, the third movie in the Blind Dead series. When a publicity stunt goes horrible wrong, two female models are stranded on a mysterious galleon at sea. The women are unaware that the undead legions of the Knights Templar are aboard and they want blood.

  House of the Living Dead (1973) - A PG British horror film that has appeared under the titles Curse of the Dead, Doctor Maniac and Kill, Baby, Kill. When Michael's fiance arrives on the South African plantation and there is a little surprise waiting for her - Michael's deformed twin brother, Breck, a maniac. Odd little film with no gore or zombies, despite what the title suggests.

  King of the Zombies (1941) - In this horror comedy, a Capelis XC-12 crash lands on an island and the survivors take refuge at a mysterious mansion owned by Dr. Miklos Sangre. Soon, they are convinced the mansion is haunted by voodoo zombies.

  The Last Man On Earth (1960) - There is a mistake on the back of the DVD jacket, as the movie came out in 1964 and not 1960! Based on the I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, Dr. Robert Morgan (played by Vincent Price) is the last remaining man on Earth as a plague has turned everyone else into vampires. During the day, he is vampire hunting and spends his nights hiding in his house as vampires walk the darkness. Suddenly, he learns that he is not alone. Other versions are Omega Man, I Am Legend and I Am Omega.

  Mutant (1984) - Two brothers are run off the road and are forced to stay in a small town, where the citizens are suffering for a strange illness. Originally titled Night Shadows.

  Night of the Living Dead (1968) - The king of all zombie movies! George A. Romero's classic film about a small group trapped inside a farmhouse with tons of zombies walking about outside.

  Oasis of the Zombies (1981) - Released back in 1982, this is considered the worst zombie film of all time. Treasure hunters are looking for the lost Nazi gold, which happens to be guarded by the Afrika Korps zombie soldiers. Also known as Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies and Treasure of the Living Dead.

  The Snake People (1968) - In one of the last Boris Karloff films, voodoo has taken over a remote island, lead by an evil priest Damballah. Captain Labesch arrives on the island to bring some kind of law and order. Also known as Isle of the Snake People and Cult of the Dead.

  Teenage Zombies (1959) - A group of teens get stranded on an island, but they are unaware that there is a mad scientist who wants to turn people into zombies. Criticized for using too much stock footage.

  White Zombie (1932) - Bela Lugosi starred in the first feature length zombie film, which is based on the book by William Seabrok. A couple, Harron and Madeline, plan on getting married on a plantation owned by Charles Beaumont in Haiti. Charles is in love with Madeline and he turns to the zombie master Legendre for a little voodoo help.

Out of the recent movie collection DVD sets Mill Creek Entertainment has been releasing, Zombies Unbrained is one of the better ones, though most of the movies are the public domain versions and the picture quality varies from movie to movie, some are decent and others are below standards. I had already seen the majority of the films on this collection, with the exception of the Blind Dead film Horror of the Zombies, House of the Living Dead, Oasis of the Zombies (horrible movie) and The Snake People (extremely weird, but interesting). Of course my favorites are Carnival of Souls, Night of the Living Dead and The Last Man On Earth, which I have seen several times. The set is under ten dollars, which is a cheap price despite the VHS quality. Overall, I enjoyed watching Zombies Unbrained, which is a perfect movie collection to watch around Halloween.
