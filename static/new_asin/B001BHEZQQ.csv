This is a great video, and sets up the students to do well.  I think other reviews do well in explaining this.

Now, the issues that arise are based on who watches this.  If the person only needs a review, or brush up on conversions, this may not be for them.  It does go through the steps; step, by step, by step, by .....

This is very good for someone that just does not get it, doesn't know how, etc.  The actual conversion tutorial is only 45min long, the rest of the DVD goes over lots of examples.",1243296000,4,699,4.203007518796992
3492989,5,B001BHEZQQ,"When I was an undergraduate majoring in physics, no one - not any Prof - dealt with a way to convert from one system of units to another. From US or British to Metric, switching between them, calculating within a given system, it was always, ""find it in a physics or math book."" All too often this inability to UNDERSTAND the 'technique' behind ANY conversion led to wrong answers due to the problems not being set up properly. Now, as a 59 years old Ph. D. research physicist, I viewed this disk and found that little 'technique' which has enabled me to get rid of those massive tombs of 'conversion-factors' books that can drive anyone crazy regardless of the formal education one has.

If anyone buys this disk and studies it carefully, he will walk away not only with the ability to convert any quantity from one system of units to another, but he will UNDERSTAND *WHY* he is doing it.

Additionally, this ability to successfully convert between systems - and even within any given system - will enable him to see into the 'physicality' of a physics - or chem problem for that matter - and better understand the nature of the phenomenon or phenomena he is studying or working with. I can't recommend this tutorial strongly enough.

Better check out this guy's math DVD's as well. The algebra through advanced Calculus are unbelievable: you will not only understand HOW to set up and solve the most complex mathematical expressions and equations easily, but better understand the abstraction behind the equations and manipulations necessary to arrive at a solution. Together, these instructional aids are the very best I ever saw, anywhere, at any time. Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",1228176000,13,1684,4.840277777777778
8283236,5,B001BHEZQQ,"This is an excellent follow-up to the chemistry tutor part 1.  It's clear and I found some good material to carry over to my students who have learning disabilities.  I would have no problem even loaning this to them to help them further their abilities in conversions.  Some of the girls could understand it themselves, but others would have to be guided through it because of their learning disabilities.  For the typical student, this is a terrific piece of software that they should be able to navigate with minimum input from a supervising adult.  It's especially helpful for teachers who want to brush up on their conversion skills.  Well worth the money.",1447372800,,661,4.857142857142857

It was a good refresher on information I had already been exposed to.",1364774400,,118,4.173913043478261
8283240,5,B001BHEZQQ,"Unit conversion or dimensional analysis is not all that hard once you learn how to do it properly, but as anyone who has taken physics or chemistry knows, knowing how (or not knowing how) to do it, will save you or kill you on exams.  This will break down step by step how to do the conversions properly whether you have a straight conversion factor to get you there in one step, or you have to do the conversion in multiple steps to go from the units you have to the units you need.  You still have to be able to recognize when you have to convert units, but if you get that down and learn what is taught on this DVD you will never get stuck and waste time figuring out how to convert the units.

In most (beginning level) science classes you may (if you are lucky) get one lecture devoted to units.  Depending on your teacher you may or may not actually get some guidance on how to properly do the conversions.  If you know this stuff going into the class, it will make life much much easier for you.  Any introductory book will usually have a chapter on units that is pretty much completely worthless, and does not show you how to convert units as well as this does, because a lot of the examples will have you using units that you will never use.  In this set Jason explains the metric system, and uses examples entirely devoted to using metric system units.  Most of the time converting between metric system units as you will have to on your homework and test, but he does give some examples of going from the English system to the metric system.

You will definitely have to do unit conversion on your homework when you are in any science class.  Depending on your teacher you may have to do them on your exams as well.  If you do them wrong you will not get the correct number and will lose points needlessly.  If you learn how to do it right, the material on this DVD may not in and of itself get you an A, but it will keep you from losing points carelessly and could be the difference between getting an A and getting a B.",1337040000,2,2032,4.222222222222222
8283241,5,B001BHEZQQ,I got this book to help with college algebra and it is wonderful.  I understand how to do the simple things better and it helps with solving problems when the book doesn't completely breakdown how to solve a problem.,1328054400,4,216,4.538461538461538
8283242,5,B001BHEZQQ,"I am not a math person, which is why this dvd was great!! He goes slowwwwwwllly and breaks it down so that even i COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. Good stuff! might get more from this set for chemistry!",1315872000,2,192,4.361111111111111
8283243,5,B001BHEZQQ,"I can remember in school (@ 1950s) when we were using ONLY British units - inches, feet, feet^2, per sec^2 etc.  Not one of my teachers actually explained IN DETAIL the reasoning behind converting from one unit to another.  So most of us used rote techniques for conversion which required memorizing stuff like how many feet in a mile etc.  Of course many of us messed up physics problems when one forgot to convert from square yards to square feet not to mention gallons to litres and milli litres.  Then in college we had our Log Tables, remember those?  These tables had a section at the end where some conversion factors were listed.  But for tests we were not allowed to use the conversion lists.  Fortunately ONE of my teachers, in Grad School nonetheless, took about two hours to give us a review of Dimensional Analysis.  That helped some.  But nothing close to what this DVD does.

This DVD is truly a MUST for all High and Middle School students.  The instructor explains with detail examples how converting from say British to Metric units is easy as memorizing a FEW basic conversion factors.  I wish I had this tool in High School, College, and Grad School when I was sweating bullets trying to recall conversion factors thus taking my mind off from the problem at hand.

Mom and Dad your kids need to have this DVD.  It will more than pay for itself.  An EXCELLENT resource.",1293580800,5,1388,4.585365853658536
8283244,5,B001BHEZQQ,Math tutor dvd's are great for anyone looking for a straight to the point/ work out several problems by examples method. I recommend the whole collection.,1279065600,,154,4.961538461538462

If there are students out there taking or getting ready to take Chemistry, Physics or any other science and are having trouble with Metric Prefix Conversion, do yourself a great favor and purchase this tutorial!",1251590400,2,322,5.333333333333333
