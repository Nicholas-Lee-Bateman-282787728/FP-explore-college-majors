2238472,5,B0007RTB9M,"Gary Cooper was without question one of the most outstanding actors ever to break onto the silver screen. How unfortunate that his untimely death would prevent us from having more gems like these.

Its true, all of these films are good, but for me one of the greatest films ever made is included: Beau Geste. I would buy any collection with that film packaged. How exciting it will be to get a jumpstart with Gery Cooper on dvd. Did he ever make a bad film? Even better than Beau Geste is the heartfelt and spiritual ""Sargeant York"" which any fan would soon hope to enter the dvd realm.

There are many rumors circulating about these discs. I wondered myself if they would cram two films onto a flipper disc, but it appears each movie will have its own disc, with hopefully some cool cover art for each.

Beau Geste is worth the price, but the remaining four films should relieve any quiestion from your mind. Cinema at its finest! ~SAOS~",1114732800,3,938,4.5058823529411764
2238473,5,B0007RTB9M,"I have seen these 5 films and had to go to some desparate links to find them (including buying a really fuzzy, dim, pirated copy of ""Peter Ibbetson"" from a bad ebay seller who got ahold of an old copy someone taped off AMC). I would personally rank them in order of my favorites as 1. ""Beau Geste"", 2. ""Bengal Lancer"", 3.""Peter Ibbetson"", 4.""Design for Living"" and 5. ""General Died at Dawn"". I havn't seen ""General.."" for a long time, but I recall I wasn't too impressed with the story, the characters or the makeup/costumes (unattractive lady can equal unappealing love scenes). The other four are very enjoyable. ""Ibbetson"" is really surreal/dreamy and romantic, ""Design"" has controversial menage-a trois type innuendo (quite racy for the era)but understandable from the girl's point of view (if you could have both Cooper and Frederic March, why not?) and ""Geste"" and ""Lancer"" are wonderful adventures with Cooper as a strong yet sentimental hero with wonderful stories and supporting characters. Certainly we all are waiting for ""Sergeant York"" to be released, but it stands alone as popular enough to be individually released. I am a huge Cooper fan who would buy 4 of these five films from the collection individually as well, but I guess those releasing it know that not many current film fans are classy enough to recognize the merits of these wonderful,little seen, little known films. I find it frightening that people would waste their money buying knock-off farce like Adam Sandler in ""Mr. Deeds"" yet have never seen the incredible, wonderful original ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" Thank God for Turner Classic Movies!",1112054400,14,1626,4.981617647058823
2238474,5,B0007RTB9M,"Just wanted to echo ""Fedo's"" 5-star review of this upcoming DVD collection.  All five films are indeed superb and worth a blind buy at the price.  Let's just hope Universal gives them a good transfer.  I understand that Universal will be following the format of their Monster Legacy collections (Dracula, Wolf Man, etc.), so these will be two-sided discs, with one or two films on each side.

Fans should note that ""Design for Living"" was directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch -- as if you needed any more incentive to buy this set.

Also, in response to ""Joel's"" review, I have to say that it's pretty unfair to give this unreleased set a low rating just because it doesn't include a specific movie.  I'd love to see ""Sergeant York"" on DVD, too, but Universal can't be held responsible for that.  Warner Home Video owns ""York,"" and I've heard rumors that they're at work on a future release.

Update:  I've taken a quick look at the transfers for these films, and they're pretty decent.  ""Beau Geste"" looks the best, and ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" fares the worst, though it's still acceptable after the first reel (about 12-15 minutes in).  Still, I'd say that Universal has done about as good a job as Warner does with their 1-disc releases of older films.  Certainly, ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" isn't significantly worse than Warner's ""Gunga Din.""  Both exhibit graininess (which can be distracting to people who are used to the clinical cleanliness of DVD releases of new movies) and some occasional damage (which is acceptable in films over 65 years old).  Equally disappointing for many will be the lack of extras -- nothing but trailers for three of the five movies.  Considering Cooper's continued popularity, I'd have expected to see at least one of those A&E Biography shows on the actor.

All in all, my only major criticism is that I simply do not like two-sided discs.  I find that they are easy to scratch.  But it keeps the price down, and this collection is a real bargain.  If you're thinking about picking up this set, don't hesitate.  It's not Criterion quality, but you won't be unduly disappointed for the price.",1111622400,18,2133,4.7289972899729
2238475,5,B0007RTB9M,"As of today, here at Amazon there still aren't any details of which movies are included in this DVD Release. Well, it includes some of the best and most intriguiging films, Gary Cooper made at Paramount Studios during the 1930s.

The set includes 2 discs and five movies: (not five discs as stated, at the moment being)

Disc 1:

""Design for Living"" (1933) with Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March.

""Peter Ibbetson"" (1935) with Ann Harding, Ida Lupino and John Halliday.

""The General Died At Dawn"" (1936) with Madeleine Carroll and Akim Tamiroff.

Disc 2:

""Beau Geste"" (1939) with Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, Susan Hayward.

""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935) with Franchot Tone, Richard Cromwell, Guy Standing and C.Aubrey Smith.

All the films are presented in Full Frame (1.33:1); English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono; English captions and subtitles in French and Spanish. I checked all of this at Universal, the company which is releasing this DVD.

It also includes Theatrical Trailers of ""Peter Ibbetson"", ""Beau Geste"" and ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"".

In my opinion this set is a must-buy, because it features very rare titles (especially ""Peter Ibbetson"" and ""Design For Living"", never before released on DVD or VHS) and the price is good.",1110931200,173,1263,4.9952153110047846

2238491,4,B0007RTB9M,"Bottom Line First:
One good reason for you to be looking at this collection is because you are a Gary Cooper fan. This collection has some of his earliest starring roles and some of these titles may be hard to find. You may be an old movie buff and these are certainly old. If you are looking for how they used to make `em, you may find one or two that are not what you took as given. The sound and video quality is better than reasonable and may be better than was first heard in the more remote movie houses. Were I to score these on the entertainment value of the 5 movies herein, I would say that three are very good, one is terrible and the fifth somewhere between. If you are not primarily a collector this is a 3.5 star collection.

Reviewing the movies:
Design for Living is a clever and sophisticated artist as bohemians' movie. For all its lack of nudity or swearing it is still a naughty movie. The design for Living has two artists sharing the same muse. She will be lover to each in turn, and she will have the chance to live in a conventional marriage. Hardly what people mean when they talk about the high morals of the movies from ""Back in the Day"". Good acting and some very humorous writing. The sofa that puffs dust becomes a great running sight gag.

Peter Ibsen has Cooper a classic quiet American Actor playing a English architect in a highly romantic movie. His childhood love is now married to a wealthy, titled Lord. The childhood love is fated to draw them together and the two are fated to be apart. How much can love transcend reality?  Great acting and good writing keeps what could be a maudlin melodrama from cloying.

The General Dies at Dawn. One of the worst movies I have watched in years. Terrible writing and leaden directing make this a slow motion train wreck. This movie is marginally watchable if you have a fondness for stinkers. William Frawley, the future Fred Mertz in I Love Lucy will play a secondary role as a perpetually drunk weapons merchant. Being drunk means he will be the only cast member excused from being wooden mouther of flat clichs. There will be one scene as most of the cast takes turns surprising each other in a room with a dead guy. Possibly the only scene in the movie worth watching, but only because its gets to be funny.
 Beau Geste, Cooper again as an Englishman. This is one of the great classic movies. The original Foreign Legion movie and the originator of many future movie conventions: The hated sergeant, the Foreign Legion as the place where nobody knows your name and the family fortunes hanging on a last desperate gesture.

The Lives of a Bengal Lancers- The quintessential quiet American is cast this time as a too talkative Canadian born officer in an elite British regiment of lancers. Lets see we have a small detachment of elite European soldiers attempting to bring civilization to murderous Muslim fanatics, led by a British trained high living tribal chieftain and all in the high mountains of Afghanistan. (Actually North West India, but close enough) Nope too unlikely never happen, or...? Bengal lances is mostly an old war house of a movie, but it has its moments. Look for the great character actor C. Aubrey Smith. If ever a man looked the part he did. The classic British senior officer, esp if the officer has command in some remote and dangerous place. He face is one of the one you automatically think of if you hear the words British colonel.",1432080000,3,3443,4.527331189710611

2238493,5,B0007RTB9M,"There is something about Classic movies that has not been replicated by the ""new"" crop of movies. The Acting on those earlier movies is so convincing that you become an invisible and silent partner of the Actor. We now rely more on  the technical aspects of a movie rather than in the way that he/she conveys Emotion and dire circumstances. I still enjoy the new movies but for a Real Emotional inner experience, there is nothing like a Classic Movie.",1429747200,,451,4.6375

2238510,4,B0007RTB9M,"Not surprisingly, low price makes for happier customers. But there are films here to consider as well, and so we shall:

BEAU GESTE - I put this first because this is the movie I bought the set for. Some complain, some praise it -- whatever. It's a particular kind of story, and I found myself wanting to see it again. When I did, I enjoyed it & had no complaint.

LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER -- it has its faults, but the interactions between the principals isn't among them. I may actually enjoy this more than BEAU GESTE; for me, these two combined justified the expense of ordering the whole set.

DESIGN FOR LIVING - well, this is Pre-Code all right -- and with Noel Coward as the writer, it's going to be people talking, analyzing & obsessing over the details of their feelings. There is a plot, but the discussions along the way are what Coward's plays are all about. Ultimately more of a 'there it is' film than a ""wow!"", which is fine.

PETER IBBETSON and THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN - evidently the sort of films I can forget I'd seen, because I did. Still worth watching again, although [like DESIGN] not so much convincing as just simple entertainment. Which is more or less what I expect from Golden Age Hollywood.",1411603200,3,1221,4.4375

2238527,5,B0007RTB9M,These are films for pre 50's classic film buffs. They are old Hollywood and just wonderful. 'Peter Ibbetson' is a side of Gary Copper I've never seen. Always a sensitive actor here in this almost metaphysical story he just wonderful and strikingly handsome. Guaranteed to make you cry (men too). It alone is worth the cost. 'Design for Living' is a rather risqu&eacute; (for the time) pre code movie about a menage a trois. That also shows a pre western very dashing Gary Cooper and the vivacious Miriam Hopkins in a great film with a lot of style. Really great fun. These are all really good classic movies.

He's unbelieveably young, handsome and virle with a large dose of sensitive in The Lives of Peter Ibbetson, THE movie I bought the collection for.  Ladies please keep your kleenex close at hand when watching Peter Ibbetson.

Design for Living is so sensual you will probably never see it on the tv.  It's just too sexy and explicit for family fare.  My husband and I could not believe this one slipped passed the censors.  It was probably made before censorship began in earnest.

In fact, the best of these disks are never or almost never played on tv.  The two movies mentioned above are alone more than enough reason to buy the collection!  Find out why audiences fell in love with Cooper and watch without the kids!

Two classics in the set, ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" and ""Beau Gest"" are excellent period pieces of a time that was still very much in living memory when the films were made, those personal aspects bring something to the storyboard which is simply almost impossible to recreate afterwards.

""Peter Ibbetson"" was personally the least preferred of the group, but that was simply down to ba personal taste which will vary.

""The General died at Dawn"" and ""Designh for Living"" fell in the middle of my personally eclectic taste, both are certainly worth watching.

Two of the staples back then were The Lives of a Bengal Lancer and Beau Geste. My aunt had had me read the book of Beau Geste and I was fascinated. The movie was just as good and although I have seen it at least a dozen times, it is still special and harkens memories of my youth and family. We are both now grandfathers, and in a day where special effects and ultra-violence are the staple movie fare of boys and teens, we look forwrd to sharing with our grandsons some of the action/adventure films of our youth. In thses films the characters and story really matter. Will anyone who has ever seen Beau Geste forget the sheer evil portrayed by Brian Donlevy as Sgt. Markoff. It is a standing joke in our family that as boys we promised each other when one of us died he would have a dog at his feet.

2238552,4,B0007RTB9M,"This is a review for Universal's ""The Gary Cooper Collection"" which
consists of five films Cooper made for Paramount Pictures from 1933 to 1939.

All five of these movies have something to recommend them and I would like to discuss each one with a sentence or two:

DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) dby Ernst Lubistch stars Frederic March, Gary Cooper, Miriam Hopkins and Edward Everett Horton.  Based on a play by Noel Coward with a screenplay
by Ben Hecht. A truly fine sophisticated comedy toned down for the screen but still very funny with wonderful lines and performances by all involved. Cooper is still
quite young looking and turns in a fine performance.

THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935) dby Henry Hathaway. Gary Cooper, Franchot Tone,
Richard Cromwell, Guy Standing, C.Aubrey Smith. One of the best and the earliest classic thirties adventure films with Cooper really starting to hit his stride.
It really looked like there would always be an empire run by England in the
many films of this stripe, and this is one of the best.

PETER IBBITSON (1935) dby Henry Hathaway. Gary Cooper, Ann Harding, John Halliday,
Ida Lupino.  Action specialist Hathaway directed this one of a kind surreal
romantic fantasy starring one of the top action actors.  PETER IBBITSON became
a major influence on the European surreal fantasy film movement a decade later.
No matter, this film is a singular delight, one of the most surprising thirties
movies that I have seen.  And Gary Cooper was just superb in PETER IBBITSON.
This film by itself is worth the price of this collection.

THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN (1936) dby Lewis Milestone. Gary Cooper, Madeleine
Caroll, Akim Tamiroff, Dudley Digges, Porter Hall. The weakest of the five films in The Gary Cooper Collection, THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN still has plenty to recommend it.
Fine performances by all involved, interesting camera work although the story bogs down in places.  Still, a pretty good film with an interesting but somewhat over the top ending.

BEAU GESTE (1939) dby William Wellman. Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, Susan Hayward, J. Carrol Naish. Gallantry abounds as three adopted brothers
join the Foreign Legion to flee the law and to save the family reputation in another one of the great thirties adventure films with an element of mystery thrown in.
Director William Wellman in his element, or one of them.

Cooper's monumental personal magnetism is on display in it's earlier form here, the best things were yet to come for him but with this collection the viewer can see
his knack for showing the audience what his character is thinking  without much talk
or emoting except with what seems to be his own natural expressions and body language.

I have no complaints about the picture or sound quality of this set and Universal
seems to have ironed out some of the freezing issues prevelant in the earlier pressings of this collection.  This low priced 2 disc box set is well worth the price, it has virtually no extras and comes in the English, Arabic and French languages. I rate THE GARY COOPER COLLECTION 4 1/2 stars.",1262044800,7,3106,4.867172675521822

Like Gunga Din, Beau Geste is a great adventure movie with wonderful characters and dialouge. It alone garners 5 stars. The other movies are all also excellent, which to me was the bonus. If I had been able to hand pick a 5 movie Gary Cooper collection, I probably would have included High Noon and Sgt.

2238555,4,B0007RTB9M,"Forget complaints about the lack of extras or the basic packaging or even the inconvenience of double sided disks; for the money, this must be one of the most interesting and entertaining DVD sets of classic films available. The set has more to offer than just celebrating the legacy of Gary Cooper. These are first rate features from Paramount, the director's studio, the studio which had the least identifiable house style. If every film is not a winner, at very least it is an interesting failure.

- ""Design for Living"" is a pre-code (1933) talk fest directed by Ernst Lubitsch, no less. This is not Lubitsch's finest hour. The film is based on a Noel Coward play which was rewritten for the screen. It stars the adequate Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March forming a ""menage a trois"" with Cooper who is miscast. There is endless indulgent chatter and a few very amusing moments but the film lacks the lightness of other Lubitsch offerings.
- ""Peter Ibbetson"" is the other unusual film in the set. This is an ethereal story of Cooper's eternal love for Ann Harding, a love which reached beyond the realms of reality. Superbly photographed and directed by Henry Hathaway, this is a film which will either bore the viewer rigid or magically stay in their memories. A teenage Ida Lupino appears as a cockney flirt. Cooper again is not ideally cast but his physical appearance makes up for his vocal gauchness and Harding is magical.

The 3 remaining films in the set are pure gold, great adventures which are as exciting today as they must have been when first released. Cooper is cast as an Englishman in 2 so he sounds ludicrous at times.

- ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" is also directed by Henry Hathaway and Cooper is perfectly cast as a soldier in colonial India, even if he is once again an improbable Englishman. Franchot Tone stands out in a first rate supporting cast and if the heroics are dated, who cares. The relationships within the barracks are very convincing. The use of stock footage adds a touch of authenticity to the settings.
- ""The General Died at Dawn"" was a box office smash in 1936. Lewis Milestone directed and one can detect a link to the films of Joseph Von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich, particularly ""Shanghai Express"". The evocative lighting, brilliant camerawork and riveting sets contribute to a moody, slightly ponderous but exciting yarn whereby Cooper plays an adventurer carrying money for the purchase of arms for rebels in China. Madelaine Carroll is the beautiful heroine and Akim Tamiroff has the best role of his career as the General. Some of the dialogue is pretentious as penned by playwright Clifford Odets but it doesn't really matter.
- ""Beau Geste"", released in 1939, is possibly the best remembered of the set. Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston star as 3 orphan brothers who join the foreign legion, ""till death do us part"". The sentiments, heroism and attitude to women belong to a different era and Cooper is again a most unlikely Englishman but William Wellman produced and directed this suspenseful adventure in his most exciting style. The film is stolen by a really evil Brian Donlevy who reputedly was as awful on the set as his character - method acting at its best! A very young Susan Hayward appears as the typically colourless heroine.

All the prints are in good enough condition, mostly better than would be indicated by a few of the reviewers here on Amazon. The worst is ""Bengal Lancers"". ""General"" is missing the second reel which spoils the continuity.

There is no doubt that Gary Cooper was at his best as a hero, someone for the audience to admire, and 3 of these films are fantastic examples of the adventure genre even if the chauvinism is antique. The other 2 films placed Cooper ""out"" of his element but they still have their points of interest. The set is really good value not only because it is cheap but because of the sheer range of entertainment on offer.",1232236800,9,3942,4.740524781341108

2238567,5,B0007RTB9M,"Gary Cooper fans, romantics and classic cinema lovers, here is a collection of five fabulous, lovingly restored films of one of the greatest actors of all time. The print quality ranges from very good to excellent and the moves are presented in their original aspect ratio.

""DESIGN FOR LIVING"" (1933) is a comedy, adapted from a play by Noel Coward, which premiered with roaring success in 1932. The plot concerns trio of intensely artistic characters: George Curtis (Gary Cooper), Tom Chambers (Frederic March) and Gilda Farrell (Miriam Hopkins). The two men fall in love with Gilda. She can't make her mind about who she loves, so they decide to move in together on a friendship basis. The arrangement works at first, then complications arise and Gilda marries her employer to solve the dilemma. Her marriage is unhappy, and both George and Tom realize they can't live without her. So, Gilda divorces her husband and the trio goes back to their original Gentleman's Agreement to live together without having sex. The film is darkly humorous and explores deeper themes that can seem controversial even today. Moral justification for infidelity and analysis of the pressures of fame are some of the topics. Directed by Henry Hathaway.

""THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER"" (1935) is loosely adapted from a memoir by Francis Yeats-Brown. The plot concerns the lives of British soldiers, defending India's borders from nomadic raiders. The movie beautifully depicts the love true friends have for one another.  Contrary to the popular modern belief that we ought to look after ourselves first and be rather selfish, ""The Lives Of A Bengal Lancer"" extols selflessness and self-sacrifice for the loved ones as highest virtue.
Directed by Henry Hathaway and with a stellar cast of Gary Cooper and Franchot Tone, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.

""PETER IBBETSON"" (1935) is very special movie. Based on the on the George du Maurier's 1891 novel and directed by Henry Hathaway is all about Love. The deep, eternal, spiritual love that so many dream of and only a few ever find. The kind of love poetically depicted by Victor Hugo: ""True love is to be two and yet one. A man and a woman blended as angels, heaven itself.""
Peter meets his childhood sweetheart Mary while he lives with his mum in France. The children are separated when his mother dies and his uncle takes him to live in London. Years later the Providence re-unites them. They still love each other and discover that they even share the same dreams, but it is too late. Mary is married.
Jealous husband, tragic incident and the husband dies. Peter is accused of his murder and jailed for life. The treatment he gets in jail is difficult to watch, but the beautiful life he and Mary have in their shared dreams rewards for it. The movie's transitions between reality and fantasy are wonderfully captured by the cinematography of Charles Lang. Gary Cooper's portrayal of Peter Ibbetson is moving and memorable and so is Ann Harding's performance as Mary. Coop's monologue, when he receives the ring she promised to send him while they were dreaming together is particularly heartbreaking.
This film carries very important messages: a blind man ""sees"" things and refuses to be unhappy and miserable. Peter & Mary, physically apart, find a way to be together. Their souls unite ""every possible moment"". Some might say, that's strange, even impossible, but ""the strangest things are true and the truest things are strange"".
In jail, Peter is restraint in chains and these chains represent the fears that destroy our souls and prevent our imagination flourish.

""THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN"" (1936) is intensely poetic and suspenseful film about love, courage, devotion and self-sacrifice for the one you love or for a good cause. Coop is O'Hara, a mercenary who fights for Democracy in China. He falls in love with beautiful Judy Perry. She betrays him, in order to help her dying father. Later, she willingly pays the price and wins back O'Hara's love. Coop is in his element here and so is Akim Tamiroff (Pablo, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"") as General Young. The movie was deservedly nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a supporting role (Tamiroff), Best Cinematography and Best Music Score. There are several scenes that show startling originality and are avant-garde. At one point, a door knob segues to a billiard ball to connect disparate scenes; in another, two characters ask questions and the answers appear in screen segments, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative. I love it!

""BEAU GESTE"" (1939) touches profoundly and is full of mystery, surprise, action and suspense. The story begins in a desert fort, where there's not a soul alive and yet, bodies disappear and the fort catches fire. The movie then takes us back in time. We are introduced to the family of Brandon Abbas Estate in England, Lady Patricia Brandon and the children in her care: adopted sons Beau, John and Digby Geste, and wards Isobel and Ghastly. There is also Sir Hector, the master of the estate. We don't get to meet him because he is always absent. He is addicted gambler and in love with a very rare and expensive sapphire, named ""Blue Water"". Fifteen years later, when the children are adults, the darn thing disappears and with it, the Geste brothers. One of them is the jewel thief. Now, if somebody wants to disappear completely and still have some excitement where would they go? The French Legion of course.
""Beau Geste"" is a movie about devotion, patriotism, bravery, honor, romance and the undying love of a brother for brother. I know, I don't make sense- high class jewel thieves, French Legion and values, but when you see the film, you'll understand what I mean. The story is so cleverly written, you'll never guess the outcome until the last credit rolls. The acting is exquisite, the soundtrack and cinematography superb and Coop brings so much beauty, sweetness and enigma to the entire production. The transfer is excellent, the picture looks as if it was shot last year. Truly great film!

We live in a challenging time. Traditional moral standards are changing, leaving us somewhat confused. For instance: marriage is no longer  important; we don't have to be in love to make love; we often call the one we share our live with simply a partner. This is why these films are so significant- they deliver in timely manner, timeless messages of diminishing values.

Everyone has favorite actors and actresses, I suppose. To me, Coop is one of the best. He showed me a wonderful world of emotional depth. A world of eternal love, friendship, gallantry, selflessness and patriotism. A world-refuge, where I'm able to loose myself for a while and then come back to reality, inspired.

I would like to thank the people who restored these magnificent films and put the DVD collection together, so we can enjoy it as much as we wish. Lastly, I thank those of you who had patience to read my long review. I sincerely hope that the magic of Gary Cooper will bring you as much joy, as it brought to me.",1226793600,21,7151,4.873355263157895

I have seen the film several times over the last forty years and never tire of William Wellman! s wonderful direction and his ability to extract the best out of the main players. The old 1938 film stands up very well when compared to the remakes that have been released in the fiftes and sixties. The big bonus here of course is that for a very modest outlay you pick up three other Gary Cooper films. However the other three films are not in the same class as Beau Geste.,1208131200,,568,4.126126126126126
2238571,4,B0007RTB9M,"If you are under seventy,it is unlikely that you can relate to the great stars of the Golden Age, which finished when TV arrived. After the trauma of WW2, cinemagoers were looking ( even more than usual) for escapism, and romance,looking to a bygone age. Stars like Cooper made us optimistic that things would improve. I saw my first Cooper movie aged 14 (Distant Drums, an indifferent western)and became a fan. I made sure I saw the next 16 he made. But now I am so glad to be living in the DVD age, where we can see our stars in their early roles. There is no point in comparisons;post-1960 movies made in the shadow of TV are different in every way from those of the Golden Age, and so are their audience, who are principally TV fans, rarely going to the cinema. We must consider ourselves lucky that pre-1950 films are being put on DVD, even if the quality is not always perfect. Stop the complaining and enjoy the fruits of the electronic age! I recently bought a Cooper five DVD pack released by MGM (including a marvellous silent Winning of Barbara Worth), and am ordering this boxed set also.(The General Died at Dawn was said to be Coop's own favourite performance, while his biographer rates Design for Living as his best role- no wonder when it was directed by Lubitsch and based on a play by Noel Coward. Bengal Lancer and Beau Geste are terrific fun, with future stars as supporting players,like Ray Milland and Franchot Tone. Peter Ibbetson is a curiosity, with Cooper acting beyond his range and looking odd with a mustache.) So if it's Cooper or Crawford, treat yourself to a slice of movie history with a boxed set.

It was originally bought by WB from Paramount, but was listed in the rumored Universial Vol 2 box set along with the other movies, so perhaps Universial has got the rights to it now again.

2238591,4,B0007RTB9M,"While this set of five films ( on two discs ) is a good representation of ""Coop's"" early Paramount output ( and a most attractive bargain ), it would have been even better if the compiler had included ""Desire"" instead of ""Design For Living"" and replaced the insipid ""Peter Ibbetson"" with the rousing ""Souls at Sea."" But the remaining three titles are fine ( even if

""The General Died at Dawn"" is an incomplete cut ). The quality of the prints ranges from good to very good. Many on-line reviewers state that

""Beau Geste"" is the best of the bunch. Certainly this is a fine production with one of the best openings of any film, but the story is a little too contrived to ring true and I've always felt that Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston ( all good actors) are unlikely brothers.

The film is virtually stolen by Brian Donlevy as the brutal sergeant. The real winner in this collection is the superb ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer.""

Well-scripted, perfectly directed amd flawlessly acted, this is one of Gary Cooper's best films and he is ably supported by the excellent Franchot Tone. The film includes a snake-charming sequence that has never been bettered. The atmosphere of India is perfectly captured and there is a rela slam-bang action climax followed by a most touching finale. Apart from its ongoing popularity ( the film was continually re-released throughout the 1930s,'40s and well into the '50s ) it influenced several other classic adventures films including ""The Charge of the Light Brigade""(1936), ""Gunga Din"" and ""The Real Glory"" (both 1939).

This collection, which shows Cooper to be a most potent screen actor in a variety of role, is heartily recommended and is worth the price for ""Bengal Lancers"" alone.",1167177600,6,1735,4.808724832214765
2238592,5,B0007RTB9M,"As I made my way to this page to write my review, I was thinking, ""This will be all five-star reviews. What Cooper fan wouldn't love this collection?"" When I got there, I was ""Shocked, shocked I tell you!"" at some of the comments I read. The world - as well as some of the reviewers on this web site - have gone crazy. For those of us who still have some sanity left, and appreciate the sanity that existed in Coop's day, I highly recommend this five-pack.

Yes, these are unrestored films. Does it surprise anyone that every film in the world has not been restored? The cost to restore one film is phenomenal - not a ""little"", as one reviewer suggested - and archivists are making their way through the stacks of black-and-whites as fast as they can. Give them time. In the mean time, be thankful that these films are available now. They are not poor quality, as a couple of people wrote. For unrestored films, they are EXCELLENT quality. And, frankly, I don't expect restoration to add a whole lot. That's probably why they haven't been restored yet.

Contrary to what ""Ohio Guy"" wrote, none of these films is corny. They're just different, and need to be watched with discernment. I loved The General Died At Dawn, and found it to be as much fun as Design For Living, which, frankly, I found to be the weakest of the lot; yet, still enjoyable. The photography in General, as in all these films, is incredible. There's something about the photography of the 1930's (these films range from 1934 through 1939): a lot of atmosphere, an understanding of lighting. When color came in, that knowledge was lost. So, appreciate these films for what they are, not for what they're not.

The art direction in all five films is also gorgeous: sets, costumes - across the board, they're top notch. The acting is different from acting today, because these actors are coming out of the silent era. They are relearning their craft. Give them some credit. They still give wonderful performances, and Coop is a treat to watch in every film.

Contrary to a few malcontents, I appreciate the fact that Universal packed these five films together, making them more affordable. Frankly, I would only have bought a few of them, had they come out individually at $20 a pop. I also like the packaging and cannot understand why anyone would have a problem with it.

I think there's a lot we can learn from the so-called corniness - I call it honesty - of Coop's day. I also think we could learn from their humility. For the most part, people back then were thankful for what they had, and didn't complain. That's how they were able to make it through the depression. I wonder how the selfish, spoiled malcontents of today would have fared back then. My guess is that, like the General, they would have died at dawn. They certainly wouldn't have been self-sacrificing like Beau Geste.

The only film that looks a bit grainy is LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER. However, this is mainly in the stock footage sequences, and there are many in this film. All the indoor scenes are stunning. Here Hans Dreier's art direction shines on the screen. A classic case of art deco meeting the Orient.

Many thanks to Universal for including an Ernst Lubitsch film as well, DESIGN FOR LIVING, which had only been released (and not a good print) on laserdisc. The transfer is very good to excellent. I just love the grain in this film. It gives it a very film-like quality. This is one of Lubitsch's great 30's films, a pre-code gem. I have paid more than the price of this boxset for one Lubitsch film alone.

BEAU GESTE is the most stunning transfer. The film looks like it was shot yesterday. Great work Universal. I am sure that the source negative (or master positive) was in great condition, as the VHS print from the early 90's looked quite good as well.
This is one of my favourite films. A rousing adventure tale, with that Paramount glow. Cooper and the rest of the cast are superb. However, it is Donlevy who always sticks to my mind. One of the great performances of the 30's. Wellman's direction is superb, and this film examplifies how underrated this director is with cinephiles.
Just out of interest, this is not the roadshow edition of Beau Geste which was 14 minutes longer. But let me do more research on this.

I think I will dream of this boxset every night.",1117584000,37,1999,4.635593220338983
2238612,5,B0007RTB9M,"I just purchased this set today and just finished watching Beau Geste. Amazing, the set is worth buy for this movie alone. I have over 330 dvds and this is instantly one of my top ten favorites of all time. I know Geste is the best one in the set. But hey I look at it like I am getting 4 movies for free, Geste is that good.",1117497600,4,325,3.7941176470588234
2238613,1,B0007RTB9M,"The 1 star rating doesn't apply to the movies. DESIGN FOR LIVING is fun, BEAU GESTE is rousing, LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER, PETER IBETSON and THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN are corny...only for the diehard collector.

What's disappointing is how Universal slapped these films together with no care whatsoever!

The transfers range from adequate to lousy, and the films are packaged and manufactured in a way that easily lends itself to

scratching and ultimate defective, worthless product.

Universal needs to take some lessons from Fox, Paramount or Warner in terms of how to release their DVDs. For shame!",1117497600,112,600,5.03030303030303
2238614,4,B0007RTB9M,"Always glad to see some new films being released by major stars. I had no idea a film had even been made of Peter Ibbetson, let alone with a major star in it. I'd like to  see two of my favorite Gary Cooper films come out on DVD: The Fountainhead and Bright Leaf. Both have sultry co-stars--Patricia Neal and Lauren Bacall, respectively. The Fountainhead can be found on VHS for a rather high price, and I don't think Bright Leaf ever even made it to VHS, to my knowledge. It was an excellent film, with Cooper playing a tobacco plantation magnate whose greed and bitterness takes over everything in his life. I can only hope that someday we'll see these two gems in a nice DVD release. Yup!!!
Addendum: The Fountainhead has subsequently been released on DVD, but still waiting for Bright Leaf as of 7/08!",1116720000,7,805,4.513698630136986

2238616,5,B0007RTB9M,"What a delight when  I found out these were FINALLY being released. Five great films, and three great COOP adventures. ""Beau Geste"" needs no build-up for anyone who has seen it. The best sound version of this classic tale.""Geste"" with ""Gunga Din"" are the pair of great adventures NOT TO BE MISSED! Also to be rewarded in the same set with TWO! of my favorite less apreciated classic COOP adventures. ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" was a big picture when it was released and did well, and an intersting precursor to ""Gunga Din"" filmed four years later. ""Lives"" had alot of location shooting done up near Lone Pine. A truly great piece of cinema. And for me personally, ""The General Died at Dawn"" I've been wearing out my VHS copy of this. A great film with a dark and mysterious quality about China of the period, captured in few films of the time(Shanghai Express comes to mind). William Frawley is priceless in another of his famous 30's film character roles. The finale was filmed with real period weapons, many a rare piece even then. Just for these three great films I'd pay the money or MORE.... with the other two 30's classic COOP added as well, what a gift, more priceless cinema, a relief from modern repetetive media....",1115251200,10,1226,4.623853211009174
