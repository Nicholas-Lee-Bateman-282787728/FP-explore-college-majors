8059028,4,B0009CTTTC,"I bought this a long time ago and never watched it except for the scene from The Marriage of Figaro and maybe another one.  At the time I seemed interested more in the lieder master class.  I was not that moved by it then, but maybe I was watching from a different perspective.  What I love today is the scene from Der Frieschutz (I love Destinn in this aria), where Madame Lehmann brings the aria to admirable, interesting, invigorating light, illuminating not only the ""larger than life"" quality that is able to be communicated at a great distance, but framing her generation's approach to movement that can sometimes be seen in some of the photos and moving images of the period.  I don't find it to be directing of profound depth (even as the Field Marshall), or of invoking some spiritual fire, but of bringing forth a kind of vibrant stage energy that begs for due attention.  Theatrics!  I think opera really needs that!

Otherwise, I read ""More than Singing"" which also does not match her, and made me afraid of ""sentimentality""  --- only the bird scene (E.Schumann) in her autobiography moved me as much, --- in other words, it is Lotte Lehamann herself that is so good here, and the singers are good too.  I imagine she can work miracles in the right talent, like maybe a Crespin as the Field Marshall or Grace Bumbry as Amneris for example.",1380067200,,1351,4.595833333333333
8059029,5,B0009CTTTC,"This was a unique artist who sang with a very special warmth, Her performances are unforgetable. There were far more glamorous opera stars in the past and present but this lady posessed the art of intimacy and very personal approach to the roles she created. She coaches young singers in the parts she either created or made her own throughout her life time. The Marschalin monologue from Der Rosenkavalier she studied with the composer, Richard Strauss, who favoured her to many others. Her approach to the role was very deep which resulted in outstanding characterisation. With similar love and understanding she is treating the Countess in Figaro, Agathe in Der Freischutz and finally in the Dungeon Scene from Beethoven's Fidelio. Her contribution to studies of the young singers involved is enormous and the DVD itself is a priceless memory to a great singer sharing har most intimate knowledge. This is a must for Opera lovers interested in great moments of vocal art. By the way, I believe there is another DVD available of her Master Classes in lieder singing.
