4121074,3,B003G715ZS,"In a nutshell:

The first comedy video from him that we saw (Kevin Hart: Im a Grown Little Man (2009)) was much funnier. In this one, he reused some of his material and wasn't that funny. There were some good ones here and there, loved the baby gestures and the grandpa, don't recall much else after that. Overall, its good to watch once, and move on.

The nitty-gritty:

SPOILERS AHEAD

Overall the film was okay, it had its moments where things were funny but if you saw the Im a Grown Little Man and then you watch this one, you will notice he really used the same lines and content, he just kind of mixed them up. My favorite was the gestures about his baby boy. The baby gesture classic! (hand waving in the air while you hear the childs sound effects). I also thought it was funny when he shouted Stop that! Its Gay! or something around those lines, it was a total guy response and just overall funny. I think it could have been better, especially when he started talking about the driving scene, that was just brutal, I think he ran out of content and was milking the clock.

4121095,5,B003G715ZS,"I first began noticing Kevin Hart in a couple of movies and on t.v. appearances promoting those movies.  He was funny!  Then I caught some of his stuff on You Tube.  Not just funny, very funny.  So I took a chance on this and two others of his videos.  Hilarious and top notch comedy on this Kevin Hart DVD!  He's a man with a brain for comedy.  And interestingly, he doesn't dwell on vulgarity to make you laugh out loud.  He just talks about his life and is hilarious in doing so.  Of the three DVDs I bought, this is one of two to buy.  You won't be disappointed.  Although I love comedy, I don't usually laugh out loud.  I laughed out loud again and again watching this video!  Buy this one!",1416441600,4,695,4.174242424242424

4121202,1,B003G715ZS,"I've seen some comedians take some pretty heinous topic ideas and make them really funny. There are some comedians who really can make a joke out of anything, Kevin Hart is not one of those comedians. When he went on his whole, ""I don't want my son to be gay"" tangent that other reviewers have brought up, I thought that maybe he could turn it into something funny...he did not. I've seen some pretty offensive bits in my day, but that just about takes the cake. I really would not have been surprised if a good portion of the audience actually left after hearing that.

Now I've heard some jokes relating to gay people that are funny. Whether it's poking fun at gay people, or making fun of people who look down on gay people there is some entertaining and respectful comedy to be found there if you know how to properly word the joke. This was tasteless, bigoted, and just wrong. It was anything but a ""joke"".

Kevin Hart was funny years ago, and still is as an actor, but this was just offensive and pandered only to the lowest common denominator.",1367539200,,1050,4.435233160621761

4121212,3,B003G715ZS,"I smiled a good deal of the time through the show, it did get a bit repetitive about half way through, so it's worth watching at least half of it, then you can decide if you want to watch or listen to the rest while you do something else.  Depends on how your tv and house are set up.  My kitchen is 10 or 12 feet away so I can spend a little while over there while listening to the tv, I don't need to SEE a comic do his routine most of the time.  Some yes, but not this one.  I also have a lot tolerance for doing just one thing at a time, so I got  BluRay player to play Netflix and Amazon and other web based programming on the tv so it doesn't suck up my computer screen space, then since I'm laying here watching tv I also play solitaire or something on the computer or chat on IRC or something at the same time.

4121258,1,B003G715ZS,"Perhaps it is a sign of the times, but comedy has evolved from Red Skelton, to Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and now, Kevin Hart.  The evolution from no profanity to profound profanity (Murphy) has in some cases made comedy funnier and better.  However, this entertainer simply isn't funny.  Now, I know comedy, like music, is a personal taste.  What I find funny others won't.  Music I like. . .others won't.  But, go back and watch Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy and when you have tears rolling down your face from laughing so hard you can't breathe, you realize how little talent is displayed here.  It is titled, ""Seriously Funny.""  The joke is on us.  He just doesn't show us the talent his predecessors had for making us laugh.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  I don't think I even SMILED watching this.  It is that NOT funny.",1357948800,2,848,4.506578947368421

I gave it a three. Will make most normal human beings laugh at least a few times, it even makes me laugh a few times. But for me, the laughs per minute are lacking so I get bored watching Kevin Hart.

4121261,5,B003G715ZS,"I think Kevin Hart is hilarious.  I have three of his stand-up DVDs and each one kept me laughing.

I think that those who criticize don't understand because it is a culture thing and I don't mean race.

Those who have experienced getting spankings or as he expressed it ""whippings"" get the humor behind it.  If you only experienced ""time outs"" then jokes about whippings float totally over your head.

Most if not all of us have low achiever in our family whether it be an alcoholic, drug addict ex-con or some sort affliction.  Most us can laugh because we can relate.  But if you don't like to laugh at the skeletons in your closet or are in denial then his humor would not be funny to you.

Also, don't expect the same subject matter or the same humor at each concert.  Forget about the last concert and allow the comic's material to rest on its own laurels.

4121268,1,B003G715ZS,"I watched about 10-20 minutes of Kevin Hart's performance. It's a shame how far comedy has fallen. This guy has no class. He has no decency. Normally, that's a formula for success in comedy, but he's nothing but a turn-off here. The guy is negative and depressing to listen to. Listening to how he and his mother abused his teachers was disgusting. He thought nothing was wrong with that! Then, like another reviewer said, the part where we said ""I don't want my son to be gay"" was the final nail in the coffin. He has the right to his opinion, but man, this was stupid and undiplomatic. If you're going to be offensive, at least be funny man. This guy doesn't even seem like he's that much fun to be around. He's just a thug that thinks he is funny. Hart is a member of the ""Worst Generation"" and he proves it with his vile stand-up act. I had heard that he was very funny, but he only appeals to a certain low-class element and lifestyle.",1336262400,5,940,4.31638418079096

And his previously material was better, before his kids became a major topic in his act, which has some decent material, but not as good as the adult humor he used to do.  And it dragged -- lots of ""down-time"" / set-up talk that does nothing to make you laugh.
All-in-all, some funny stuff, but it is almost a chore to sit through the whole thing waiting for the occasional nugget.
The replays of the Martin Lawrence show currently airing on Starz, featuring random 5-minute acts from amateurs is a lot funnier than this...",1326931200,3,628,4.598214285714286

Always making you grin and smile and other times laughing out loud guffawing - people take some statements too much to heart: it is a comedy routine and much of the opening statements are setups for the punchlines, don't take them seriously.  I liked his honesty whether it be his fears of his son being gay or his black inside jokes (I am white) they added to the routine.  If you're gunna be offended by statements like those IN A COMEDY ROUTINE, then you're already searching for the wrong comedians in your library.
