5105225,5,B007R915RE,"Paramount, or whoever the idiots are that release this series, must realize that their European distribution - which is a few seasons ahead of the US releases - are sucking alot of potential profits from their tills. Region-free DVD players are cheap, guys. However, I am happy to see they finally are releasing Season Six for US dvd players. I saw it last year and I had forgotten how good it was; Im happy to preorder it for my niece. Now if only they would release the rest of the series and The Colbys....

5105229,5,B007R915RE,"Paramount will be releasing the complete sixth season of ""Dynasty"" on DVD in a 2 pack set on July 3, 2012. Fans can either purchase each pack with 15 episodes each or buy both DVD packs together which will house the season's full 30 episodes. The sets will unfortunately have no bonus features.

 The sixth season of ""Dynasty"" (1985-1986) was an amazing year as it started with the outcome of the show's biggest cliffhanger: ""Who survived the Moldavia Massacre?"". There are two deaths and I won't saw who they are. This was the year too that Joan Collins received a substantial pay hike making $100,000 per episode making her, at that time, the highest-paid actress on network U.S. television. Contract talks between Joan and ABC broke down during the summer of '85 so bad that she actually is missing fom the very first episode. Thankfully, ABC caved in and gave Joan what she wanted.

 What season 6 is known for was ""The Colbys"", ""Dynasty's spin-off that starred John James, Emma Samms and a host of Hollywood royalty including Charlton Heston and Barbara Stanwyck. Its also starred British actress Stephanie Beecham in the role of Sable Colby, Alexis' first cousin who stole every scene she was in.

 The stories this year were simply superb and dealt with both the arrivals of Blake's evil brother Ben and Alexis' sister Caress who had a bone to pick with her. Alexis decided it was high time to destroy Blake once and for all so she looked in the Austalian outback for his brother and brought him back to Denver to destroy the tycoon. Another wonderful story featured Heather Locklear as Sammy Jo, intent on getting the money her father left her, but realized since Krystal was the executor of the estate she couldn't get her hands on her money. So, Sammy Jo found a Krystal impersonator named Rita (with Linda Evans in a dual role) and replaced Krystal with the impostor with help by maniacal Joe and kept the real Krystal captive in an attic.

 The finale showed nutty Claudia talking to herself at La Miarge lighting candles as the hotel went up in flames with Dominique inside and Blake attempting to actually kill Alexis when he found out she bought him out and ruined him financially. Her last words to Blake as she stood on top of the Carrington stairwall were, ""Take all this junk and your blond tramp and get out of my home..."".

 A fabulous year and one of my favorite seasons of the best primetime soap opera that ever aired. ""Dynasty"" finished a very healthy #6 on the Nielsen Ratings still beating out ""Dallas"".

 Again, there are 30 episodes with one being a two hour show that was split into two for syndication that was called ""The Titans"". This season was the last for several cast members including John James, Emma Samms, Catherine Oxenberg and Pamela Bellwood who was an original cast member.

 Season 7 has already been released overseas so we will see that season being released here in North America sometime in 2013.

 There is also no word yet if ""The Colbys"" will be released on DVD at this time so let's cross our fingers!!!",1333497600,18,4191,4.646820027063599

5105247,4,B007R915RE,"Ah-Dynasty. This is your true, blue classic guilty pleasure from the 1980's. It is pure escapism and nothing but. The clothes are fantastic and the story lines are over the top, but still enjoyable. At least they were a bit believable this time. For its time while it lasted, Dynasty was a great show with a great ensemble cast that worked along and off of one another. The fashions were beautiful; something no other nighttime soap offered. This was the last season for long lost daughter Amanda portrayed by English actress Catherine Oxenberg. In my humble opinion, the earlier shows were the best, especially seasons two through four and excluding season one, which was bloody awful.
Overall, if you're into guilty pleasures, trashy sort of stuff, pure fluff and pure trips of escape and entertainment, pure escapism and racy plotlines, there is no reason you won't like this show or in particular this season. Just be sure not to expect Shakespeare. Who! Wait a minute! Dynasty is to its day what Shakespeare was to his day. I do detest the way that these DVDs are being released in the USA. It shows how badly the studio wants to squeeze this country for every dollar it can get where in Australia and the UK, this isn't the case.",1423699200,,1235,4.695852534562212

That said, this was the season that the spin-off ""The Colbys"" was introduced.  There are major holes in the Dynasty story since there were crossover story lines but are just mentioned here in Season 6.  The whole mystery of the missing Fallon and she and Jeff reuniting.  It pops up in lines but fans are left trying to remember what really happened.  Also the storyline with Krystal being kidnapped and the fake Krystal/Rita really gets old.  And George Hamilton was beyond creepy - much more a slimball than I originally remember.  Dynasty fans will love this BUT find themselves scratching their heads.  The Colby episodes should have been worked in here so the whole Fallon storyline makes much more sense",1392681600,,829,4.701388888888889

5105257,5,B007R915RE,"The Sixth Season is where it all comes together and explodes with drama.  Tons of action and the character Alexis never makes for a dull moment.  Also new actors for a wide variety of both the old and the new.  Linda Evans does a great job playing a double role as Blake's wife who is kidnapped in a well-thought out plot and then as the imposter woman who takes over and moves into the Carrington estate.....you'll have to get this season to find out how the plot ends and keeps on forging to new heights.  I watched this series back when it aired each week for about the first 4 seasons and had lost interest because season 4 was slow and unexciting, but I'm finding after watching seasons 2 - 6 from the beginning I missed out on the best part of this popular 80's hit series.  I have to say Joan Collins is both beautiful and plays her role as Alexis with no disappointments.  If nothing else the show is always fun to watch just to see what outlandish, beautiful expensive gowns, furs, and jewelry Alexis will adorn herself with next!  A definite must-see Season, and Season 5 was worth it too!  Have fun with it and vicariously live the life of back-stabbing wealthy brothers, greed, luxury and love combined!  It's just a show but definitely perks your curiosity about how the other half does it.  They don't write them like they used to!!",1391644800,2,1346,4.457142857142857

5105261,5,B007R915RE,"Where else can you find the bitchiest 50 year old, dressed in the most extravagant gowns of all time? Sounds like the perfect show to me! Yes, DYNASTY was without a doubt that one show that basically encouraged fans to sit back, put up their feet and watch how these ""rich bastards"" are living! No other show, not even the ultra popular DALLAS, could take fantasy to that level.

The show made you feel as though you too could be a Carrington living in a mansion and drinking champange. The ""storylines"" or perhaps lack of, left plenty of room to emphasize what audiences really wanted to see: sex, power, vanity and the most expensive jewels in all the world! This is DYNASTY and the 80s at its very best!

This 1985-86 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in the 7th grade and was shown on ABC every Wednesday night at 9PM after THE FALL GUY at 8PM.",1389830400,,877,4.3090909090909095

5105266,4,B007R915RE,"It was the last Dynasty season with high rating (in TOP 10). The first 15 episodes are - mostly - awful, with Krystle/Rita plotline, Moldavia stupid things and puzzling The Colbys characters. The last 15 episodes are partly great, party just good. The best episodes are: The Divorce, Ben and The Masquerade. The cliffhanger is not as good as in previous seasons, but still acceptable and shocking. I like this season especially because of Alexis - Ben - Blake triangle plotline and Steven - Bart Fallmont relationship. Amanda - Sammy Jo - Clay Fallmont triangle plotline is also interesting to watch. After Rita is gone, Linda Evans seemed to be a little pointless in the story concept. On the contrary, Joan Collins was more and more important. Death of Luke Fuller in the opening episode and the moment when Blake discovers his brother Ben are highpoints of the season. Conversely, new Fallon's NOT appearing at the party in The Titans episode was the biggest disappointment for me. And thanks for remastering of the picture! There is a huge difference in the quality between US and European version.",1370304000,,1102,4.898395721925134

8521295,3,B007R915RE,"This is when the famed ""Dynasty engine"" starts to stall. The first half of the season is dragged down by two overlong storylines: Endless Moldovia political intrigue (already souring after the limp, delated aftermath of last seasons cliffhanger) and The ludicrous, never-ending Krystle/Rita kidnapping/imposter swap (For context, the packaging for this season is divided into two cases for each ""half"" of the season. The ""Rita"" subplot takes up the ENTIRE first case...and the first disc of the second untill it's mercifully ended!)  But you're rewarded for your patience through these endless slogs, because once Alexis gets over her Moldovia obsession and Krystle is finally rescued (and we survive some unneeded intrusions from that abortive mess of a spin-off, The Colbys) you feel like the REAL season has begun with Alexis pulling off her most delicious and devious plot against Blake and the writers upping the shade-fests and bitchy confrontation to new heights. Irritating go-nowhere characters like Joel Albercore and Prince Michael are traded for delightfully devious schemers like Caress (don't call her ""Cassie"") and Ben. The off-the-wall ruthlessness of the second half of the season almost makes up for the slow, turgid subplots of the first.",1508457600,,1257,5.413265306122449

8521298,5,B007R915RE,"I'm only halfway through this season of Dynasty so far. I'm watching it along with The Colbys (Season 1). It's fun watching the two shows together in the original airdate order, since the storylines often interweave.

Season 6 introduces a 'new' character by the name of Rita Lesley (played by Linda Evans, officially introduced in the previous season) as a Krystle look-alike. This storyline dominates the first half of the season. The real Krystle is kidnapped and locked away at the ranch, while the imposter fools everyone into thinking she's the real Krystle, even though they often get the feeling something isn't quite right. They must have had a lot of fun with this. There's a scene where Blake gives Krystle (Rita) some expensive jewelry, and in her surprised reaction reverts back to her Rita voice before remembering she's supposed to be Krystle. I think I might have seen the two actors wanting to laugh there?
