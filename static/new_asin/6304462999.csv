895625,5,6304462999,I found this to be very interesting. I received this very quickly for the location I am at. Great viewing.,1358380800,,106,4.35
895626,3,6304462999,This DVD is 20+ years old.  It is OK for the basics of criminal profiling but was made during the period when profiliers' skills were highly exaggerated.,1356998400,,153,4.666666666666667
895627,2,6304462999,"I have seen several episodes of FBI files and Case Studies in Forensic Science, where there were individualized and in-depth treatment of cases covering behavioral profiling. Because I find forensic psychology interesting, I decided to buy any show that talks about this topic, and also because I ran out of FBI files and Forensic shows to watch. And so the purchase was made.

I can't say that it was exactly bad, but it's just that I already knew everything what they featured, probably even more, so to me, it was a total waste of time and money.

To put it another way, the show was like a trailer to a very good movie.

If you've seen any in-depth or detailed discussion about behavioral profiling, such as FBI files or Case Studies in Forensic Science, by all means, keep out. If not, it would be a show that will pique your curiosity towards behavioral science and will pave the way for a very fascinating interest.",1336521600,,922,4.609756097560975
895628,5,6304462999,"I enjoyed this Documentary mainly because one of the persons was a local serial killer in the Rochester NY area, Arthur Shawcross.  Interesting how the doctors describe persons with killing tendencies.",1311033600,,201,5.483870967741935
895629,4,6304462999,"This documentary is a compelling look inside the process of catching a serial killer through criminal profiling, it follows an FBI team on the hunt for Arthur Shawcross, the murderer of 11 prostitutes in Upstate New York, as well as touching on some other cases, including the Son of Sam Murders and others. It is interesting to watch how these FBI investigators can pin point an individual so throughly through profiling. The only complaint that I have about this documentary is that it, being made in 1992, is a little outdated, but never the less compelling.",1203724800,9,561,4.854166666666667
895630,3,6304462999,"This film discusses stranger murder. It covers a few of the most extreme cases of stranger murder in the USA in an exploitive way. In the USA there are about 22,000 homicides each year with most of them committed by guns. Over 80% of these homicides are not between strangers. Only a very small percentage of these homicides are sensational cases as discussed by this film.

Due to lack of balance this film gives a wrong idea of the problem of homicides in the USA which is for the most part not between strangers. This film creates unnecessary fear.",1104969600,,551,4.565656565656566
895631,5,6304462999,"This dvd is just extraordinary, so very interesting and extremely well done. Once again, you have John Douglas in it and that's such a treat for anyone interested in profiling.
This dvd is so interesting that you'll be upset when it's over, buy it without hesitation.",1031443200,10,267,4.826086956521739
895632,4,6304462999,"My husband and I watched this together. It's not long enough to keep you enthralled, but it is intriguing to delve into the minds of some of these psychos and see what makes them tick. NOVA does a good job as a documentary, but doesn't really go into depth about the makings of a serial killer, or the profiling of a serial killer. The film would have been much better had it been better researched and lengthier, but it is still a fascinating review of some of the famous serial killers of our time.",1031356800,6,500,4.329787234042553
895633,5,6304462999,"NOVA: MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER examines the horrifying reality of serial killers. This video, narrated by THE X-MEN's Patrick Stewart, looks at how law enforcement (FBI, etc.) deals with this type of criminal. The video examines different types of serial killers (organised, disorganised), the makings of a serial killer, case histories, and the process known as criminal profiling. Criminal profiling has been used to track down & convict serial killers like Wayne Williams & others.
The video also tracks down the investigation of murdered prostitutes in the Rochester area. The investigation led to the capture & conviction of Arthur Shawcross. Shawcross was a recently paroled sex slayer who was found responsible of at least 10 murders. Using criminal profiling along with other evidence, the FBI successfully imprisoned Shawcross to a term of life imprisonment.
NOVA: MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER is a must-have for true crime afficionados. Highly recommended.",981417600,17,960,5.406666666666666
7873640,5,6304462999,"I have used this VHS in class teaching Forensic Science, and I was happy to see that it was offered as a DVD.",1519689600,,109,3.782608695652174
7873641,5,6304462999,Got it for hubby who has a fascination with the minds of these types of criminals.  I didn't watch it but he said it was very well done.,1443657600,,136,3.857142857142857

7873643,5,6304462999,"Each time I watch it, I gain a little more from it. I like the voice/narrator. I find his voice sooths me, even though he is detailing horendous crimes. Takes all kinds.",1398297600,,169,4.3125
7873644,5,6304462999,I thought this gave good insight and offered interesting perspectives of the mind of those who commit serious crimes like the ones highlighted.,1391731200,,143,5.260869565217392
7873645,5,6304462999,One of the best and most comprehensive shorts about this horror and the men that have made it there lives work to capture these criminals.,1386806400,,138,4.56
7873646,3,6304462999,"The DVD's focus was to provides insight into why serial killers go on murderous rampages, and show how that insight is used to help capture them. Most of the coverage involved a middle-aged male serial killer of prostitutes in Rochester, N.Y. - tracking his killings and attempting to analyze his motivations. Inadvertently, however, the material also revealed that the perpetrator had recently been released from prison for killing two children, then run out of the town he moved to, and then resettled into Rochester by authorities just prior to the serial killings began there. My belief is that he should have been caught much sooner through traditional detective work.

Similarly, with Wayne Williams, the African-American convicted of killing a number of young blacks in the Atlanta area. He was caught when police noticed he was dumping bodies in the water - the psychological profiling made no contribution.",1381708800,,915,5.224489795918367
7873647,5,6304462999,"This as a book for my daughter for college and we found it and she loves it. The pricing is great. I recommend everyone
to buy from you.
Thanks, Brenda",1366156800,,151,4.066666666666666
7873648,5,6304462999,This was a very interesting film. I loved all the interviews and discussions that took place in it. It manages to give a lot of information without being too disturbing.,1362787200,,169,4.666666666666667
7873649,4,6304462999,"This DVD is fairly dated.  I teach some criminal justice courses in upstate NY and bought this because I knew it contained a substantial focus on area killer Arthur Shawcross.  And for this purpose it works well as I have the students watch in class and then complete an assignment related to Shawcross.  But, if I were buying for the larger topic of serial killers without being concerned about one in particular, I would now go for more updated material, such as the ""Most Evil"" series.  Don't get me wrong, it's good- but you're getting into a time machine and will be able to tell you're watching something produced last generation (from a person in 2013).",1360368000,,660,4.663793103448276
