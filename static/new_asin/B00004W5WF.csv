The actors were foolish but they all kept me watching to see what was gonna happen next. The first part of the movie when they were in tbe school kept running around in circles but after it the movie speeded up some. I liked the ending the most out of this movie, i never expected them to be the killers and that there were two.",1457136000,,426,4.144578313253012
7924785,2,B00004W5WF,"I was looking forward to this for two reasons. One, it had Fangoria's name on it and two, because I enjoy indie horror movies. Plainly put, I can't believe Fangoria is associated with this film. It has nothing compared to the quality of Lady of the Lake, or Slashers. The dubbing is terrible. Now, I know that this was a german movie dubbed into english, but come on! It just doesn't look right. I've seen skin flicks with better dubbing! The script must have been written by a twelve year old. It's bad, even for a horror movie. After awhile, I watched it in fast forward mode and found nothing remotely interesting to put it back in regular play mode. Avoid this at all costs. If you like cheesy horror movies, get Attack of the Killer Refridgerator, or Slashers, but definitely save your money and leave this one on the shelf.",1123977600,,829,4.496688741721854
7924786,4,B00004W5WF,"Well I saw this movie in the previews section of $LA$HER$ and thought i would check it out...
I'm gonna keep it short and say that this movie was not that bad.  It had a cool and original killer, a few good plot twists, and good characters.  the only thing that made it not that enjoyable was the german.  Now I am all for films in diffrent langauges, I don't mind ready subtitles.  But the subs here [are bad].  I put them on cause I heard the dubbing was bad, but the subs are worse.  First off they are always late.  Like 10 seconds after someone says something the sub comes on.  And by then someone else is prolly allready talking so it gets very confusing.  So about half way through the movie I gave up and switched it to dubbs, wich wasn't that bad acctualy.  Although the voice acting isn't that good the are better than the subs.
So besides the [bad] subs and dubbs this movie is good.  A few scary parts, good acting, and cool killer.  I recomend.",1059609600,3,958,4.232044198895028
7924787,3,B00004W5WF,"Okay, so I'm a movie buff.  I'm trying to get into the production side of film making and I have to say this film would have probably been like a stepping stone for me or a gateway into the major horror films.  It wasn't bad at all.  Except for a few annoying things:
I agreed with some of the others, the dubbing did get on my nerves at first but then I just stopped paying attention to the actors' lips.  The acting could have used a bit more work on some of the characters but they were better than most American actors today, so I didn't mind that too much.  And yeah the opening scene could have been written a lot better and with more originality (it did seem like the opening for SCREAM.)
But all in all the movie had a good twist at the end which surprised me and I must say the soundtrack was pretty good!
I think the Germans are getting the idea of what makes a good scary movie. . . surprises and a good track!!",1012608000,2,922,4.071823204419889
7924788,4,B00004W5WF,"I think the people shouldn't give a bad mark for this movie, because it's just a german TV-Horrormovie, but goog for that.
A few actors of this chilling movie are german soap-stars. Of course this movie followed the concept of ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend"" and it has a good and scary atmosphere. This movie for example isn't the only german scary movie (OK, one year later a bad sequel was made, it was called ""Boarding school for girls - no one can hear you scream""). There are a few movie, which are normaly untypical for a country like Germany. In 2000 the most favourite german scary movie was ""Anatomy"", in the same year ""Flashback - Murderous Holidays"" was made, the most chilling product of the german movie-industry. In 2001 ""Swimming Pool-The death celebrates with you"" was a product of a german director with a cast of americans,germans and actors from England. But it was a big flop in all cinemas. I'm from Germany, I can garanty for it. But ""School's out"" is very good for a TV- movie.",1010102400,2,997,4.606741573033708
7924789,3,B00004W5WF,"Schools Out is an ok flick.  The first killer is sort of obvious but the second killer is nearly impossible to find out.  The characters are typical and flat, but the filming and sets looked really nice looking.
What really holds this movie back is the dubbing.  It is beyond horrible! Never in the movie does the words match up with the mouth.  Now at first it was cheesy, but when the film tried to be serious it got really annoying. Why couldn't Fango release a subtitled version?  It would have been so much easier to watch.
Well otherwise the film is ok.  It gets a little slow, but the ending is really good, and the movie looks great (plus the killer's mask rocks).",977184000,3,672,4.379032258064516
7924790,5,B00004W5WF,"This dark and brooding chiller import proves that not only Americans can make effective horror films. Just like OIe Bornedals Danish original ""Nightwatch"", ""School's Out"" provides a highly menacing atmosphere from start to finish and some unexpected plot twists. It also delivers a top-notch performance from its female lead. Great Grand Guignol set pieces abound in the eerie main location of the ancient school building. The visionary quality of some scenes also adds a special touch and makes this more of an ""adult"" horror film than a common teenie slasher.",974160000,6,561,5.2444444444444445
7924791,2,B00004W5WF,"I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I didn't buy it) and was really disapointed.  The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal.  Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time, some teenagers decide to party in a spooky old school where they just graduated from.  There is alot of running around, people crawling through air vents, and of course stabbings.  It isn't even gory if you're into that sorta thing and the beginning, which is like a rip-off of Scream is just plain silly....Skip this one or rent it if you have insomnia...",973123200,3,666,4.7155172413793105
