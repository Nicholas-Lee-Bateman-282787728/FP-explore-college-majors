4386974,3,B004IM2M70,"The story lacks substance and depth. You don't feel the character's suffering as a quadriplegic and the reason for his petition becomes irrelevant in my opinion. The actors are all in their element and give a decent performance, including Aishwarya Rai much to my chagrin because I think she is a less than mediocre actress. Sanjay Leela Bhansali could have done a better job of portraying the character as a man whose body is wasting away in order to garner the attention of the audience and make us understand why he is in so much agony. It's difficult to feel sorry for the character of Ethan when he is shown to have a successful career with a legion of fans after the accident that left him disabled. Not too many people who are disabled have that kind of opportunity and this film fails to grasp the fundamentals of living a life as a quadriplegic. It's not fluff movie making, but the character is not too believable and neither is the story. Overall, it's worth watching. Hrithik Roshan does a great job with the material that he is given. Unlike most Bollywood actors, he is not lazy and does not take the easy way out.",1295136000,3,1128,4.534313725490196

The limited dark, rich hues and set decoration give it an unwordly, fable-like appearance, and its two beautiful stars never looked better. Hrithik Roshan is to be commended for completely leaving his action/musical roles to let his inner beauty shine through as the character Ethan. And best of all, this is a LOVE STORY which does not preach other issues. Aishwara Rai's Sofia is a new model of cinematic devotion. There may be tears, but they will be tears of joy. I saw it at a theater in Houston, Tx, and can hardly wait to own this copy.....I hope the Blu-Ray version will follow shortly!",1293408000,25,668,4.621848739495798

4386977,5,B004IM2M70,"A very unusual story of love, loss, jealousy, forgiveness, and inner strength. Hrithik Roshan plays a magician/dancer who can leave his Indian audiences spellbound with his talent and intense showmanship. (Think David Copperfield, as a dancer and aerialist.) the greatest magician in India becomes a victim of treachery and reinvents himself as a popular DJ, writer and inspirational speaker in Goa. The estate to which he has retreated is breathtakingly beautiful, and the people he has surrounded himself with are talented and loyal. But there comes a time when the joy and meaning of his sheltered life begin to fade, and he requests an end to it all. Guzaarish - Hindi for ""request"" - follows the lives of this strong-willed man and the people who love him, as he attempts to challenge his country's laws against euthanasia. A surprising and touching treatment of moral and ethical issues. It's a gorgeous film to see, beautifully acted, and not without humor or surprises. There is no category you can put this one in, except perhaps Great Romances. There are subtitles, fortunately, to help you through this complex plot. See it, and be prepared for some intense emotions, as this skillfully written film forces you to consider a contemporary ethical debate in our society.",1411948800,2,1279,5.0663507109004735

But even if you did have to read subtitles it's worth it to watch this man act.  He is a brilliant actor, dancer.  Check him out in Agneepath, Jodha Akbar, Lakshya, the Krrish trilogies.

4386990,4,B004IM2M70,"Hrithik Roshan does an absolutely beautiful job in this film. His role as a magician who is left a quadriplegic in a freak accident allows you to not only see his struggles with everyday life, but the emotional toll it takes on him and those he's surrounded by. This film also covers the topic of human euthanasia which is a topic not many want to touch but this film does it in a way that allowed you to see it from both sides. It does make you question whether people should be allowed to choose to die or not. The director Sanjay Leela does another excellent job with visuals in this film like his previous films that just captivate you.",1375747200,,640,4.341666666666667
4386991,5,B004IM2M70,I cryed during the whole ending of this movie to have such a brilliant love story like this is truly the best idea of love!

4386993,5,B004IM2M70,"I think this is the best performance that Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai have done together. Hrithik is brilliantly convincing as a  quadriplegic. Even though he is handicapped, he still looks handsome in the film and has such a cute personality. Aishwarya looks stunning as his personal nurse. Her spanish style and wardrobe really makes her look like a beautiful Spanish woman. This is a wonderful movie. At first I didn't want to see this film because, although I am a huge Hrithik and Aishwarya fan, I didn't want to see Hrithik in such an awful state. I thought the movie would be too depressing. But I took a chance and saw it...and I'm glad I did. The movie is neither depressing nor sad but actually beautiful and uplifting. The humor and the warmth of the characters makes you forget about your problems for a moment. Anyways, I love this film and I had to own it. I am from California and I love Bollywood films. This film, however, is very westernize. The language is both in English and Hindi so if you're American like me you won't have any trouble. I recommend this film 100%",1368403200,4,1091,4.566326530612245

The singing & the actors(Good looking)are very bad. The director should investigate more about Portuguese history before making it...It's rather Spanish!!! Javier Bardem would be very disappointed if he sees this movie...One star, just for the cinematography...",1364688000,,395,5.387096774193548
4386995,5,B004IM2M70,"First off, I have to say that this movie robs me of any credibility when it comes to my ability to be objective. For the most part I try to make these reviews balanced, and funny. (I know I fail more often than not at the funny) Unfortunately, there are times when one cannot even attempt at leaving personal beliefs and circumstances out of art. For me, this is one such time. From the opening scene my point-of-view is unashamedly biased. Why, you may rightfully ask? To that question I can only reply, because Ethan and I have a very similar perspective of the world. We view it in treacherous bodies confined to wheelchairs, beds, and couches. In my case my Cerebral Cortex was damaged some time during or before my premature birth resulting in Cerebral Palsy. Ethan's plight was born from an accident. Either way, when you live at the mercy of a fickle and treacherous body which slowly robs you of independence and freedom, you can't help but see life differently from the vast majority of your fellow human beings.

So yes, I can't be objective because I've got quite a bit in common with the hero. He's got a radio station, I have this lovely laptop which allows me to indulge my great passions the chief of these being words. Speaking of words, I've picked up quite a bit of Hindi from this raging Bollywood addiction and I have to say that next to Pyar, (love) I'm enthralled with the word Guzarish, (Request) and yes I did spell it properly, Hindi movie titles usually add or subtract letters in words to suit numerology. Guzarish is a powerful word, to request is more than just to ask, it's deeper than that. Which brings me to a lesser reason of why I can't be objective about this film, the request itself, the guzarish to die. Because of my faith, the sanctity of human life is non-negotiable, in other words I would never kill myself or ask another person for assistance to end my life. Now you may rightfully be thinking, ""why you little hypocrite! How can you possibly rate this movie five stars when you believe Ethan shouldn't make this guzarish?""

Good question! Frankly I haven't decided if I'm hypocritical or not. All I am certain of is I understand the most important thing that makes this movie so important to me. I understand WHY! I understand why Ethan has made his request, I understand why his best friend decides to fight for him, I understand why it breaks the heart of the woman who loves him more than her own life, but stands by him anyway, I understand why his doctor cannot and will not condone it, and I understand why his mother loves him unconditionally. It's the WHY that makes this film work.

I admit, I'm no Ethan. I have my hands, my lungs work just fine, my kidneys are great, I'm not even paralyzed. I've just gotten too old and too weak to haul myself around on my legs. I can feel just about all sensation, although as the years pass it decreases in certain areas. Unlike Ethan, I live in constant agonizing pain that never lets up for a moment. There are other difficulties that I face and I've got no hope for major improvements, forgive the expression, 'it all goes down from here.' So there are days when I really wish I didn't wake up. But whenever I watch this movie it hits me, ""This man can't feel the touch of his loved ones. This man can't hold a baby in his arms. This man will never make love to the one person he loves with the very deepest parts of his heart and soul! This man can't even hold his mother's hand! This man can't break things in a temper."" Then I wonder, which is worse feeling nothing, or pain so bad it drives you crazy sometimes? I've come to the conclusion neither is worse, it's all a living hell. But at least my thing doesn't condemn me to a slow and terrible death. Poor Ethan, not-so-fortunate. So yeah, I totally understand why he's made his guzarish, but like his doctor, I can't agree with it.

Ethan's flaw isn't selfishness, it can't be selfish to want to spare his loved ones witnessing the inevitable death he's destined for without intervention. Nobody with a heart wants their loved ones to have the agony of sitting by helplessly watching them suffer. I speak from experience. Ethan's flaw is weakness, he simply cannot face the end he's being forced to have. I don't blame him for that! After so many years of fighting and overcoming he's run out of strength, and he doesn't have the capacity to draw it from others. I don't agree with his solution but I do understand. My compassion, my empathy, my own suffering compels me to understand, and because of it I cannot and will not condemn.

That doesn't mean I'm on his side, I'm not! If I'm on anyone's side it's Sophia! If there's one thing that's kept me from making my own guzarish over the years it's the simple fact that my loved ones need me alive because they NEED to give me their love. You can't give love to a corpse. Sophia needed to love Ethan more than he needed to die! Ah Sophia, as much as I see myself in Ethan I also see myself in her. Another reason I've never made a guzarish, is that you can't *give* love if you're a corpse. Giving love is a powerful reason to live, and in Sophia's case heal from an abusive husband. If there is one MAJOR flaw in this film it's that Ethan never acknowledges that what he's doing is taking away Sophia's greatest happiness, loving him. Granted she knows, he knows, and he knows, she knows, he knows, (yes I'm going for a tiny bit of levity) but still, would an ""I'm so sorry that I'm too weak to endure what's next,"" be out-of-line here? As a woman, I don't think so!

Now enough of this sentimental stuff! Time to get down to the nitty-gritty of movie greatness. Production: Sanjay Leela Bhansali is one heck of a director! Okay my favorite is still Ashutosh Gowariker is still my favorite! He made,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jodhaa-Akbar-Three-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0015B04EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;people, and it doesn't get better than that! But Mr. Bhansali is pretty darn close! Like Mr. Gowariker, he creates images like fine paintings on screen. He is one obsessively intense micro-manager, and it works! Every sight and sound is exquisite to experience. I appreciate someone with a vision and the talent to get it. But I just have to say, from the interviews I've read he's a very intense personality, to put it mildly. I think he's the Van Gough of Hindi films. I love Van Gough, but I'm glad I'm not a Bollywood actress that's for sure! Good thing his stars aren't so sensitive, and cue the ""love letters"" they start now!

First up: My Hindi film queen, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan! This is actually, the last film she's done since her pregnancy and birth of her little daughter. In other words, it's been three years! Now I'm all for taking time out to be mama, I wish more people liked raising babies better than making money. That said, if you're an actor and you're going on hiatus for a while leave with an ASTOUNDING role! Mrs. Rai Bachchan is a very smart lady. She played all her cards right, she paired with a director who considers her his favorite muse, she teamed up with her best leading man (on film) these two have some white hot chemistry&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhoom-2-Bollywood-Movie/dp/B0016GOJYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhoom 2: Bollywood Movie</a>, and she made sure she got a juicy non-item-girl role with a slamming dance number. Now that is using your brain! Also I have said this many, many, times this poor woman is tragically underrated as a superior actor simply because God decided to break the mold when her DNA was being mixed. Yes she's beautiful! As Ethan says ""I don't call her sister"" how can he? But this woman is so much more than just beautiful! As great as the script and the Director of this film is, Sophia wouldn't exist without Mrs. Rai Bachchan, ergo Ethan wouldn't exist!
Not even the Shashensha of Bollywood can do everything alone.

Hrithik Roshan, or as I like to say, here is what would happen if aliens abducted Errol Flynn, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, and Gene Kelly mixed their molecular structure and deposited this new amazing creature on planet earth! I've pontificated at great length about how super he is in everything he does, but this (until I see Agneepath) is the culmination of every power. Perfection, sheer, unadulterated, perfection in every way! As I mentioned I live in a chair myself, and I can tell when an ""able-bodied"" actor just sits in one and la ti da's it. Mr. Roshan is not a la ti da! In fact, he did just as good as Sam Worthington did in AVATAR. He let the chair become his body, and he never once twitched a finger! Why wasn't this movie submitted for Oscar consideration? I can't choose a favorite scene, but I do know the one that made me believe he was Ethan. I won't say what happens but it involves a vase, and all I could think was, ""he gets it! He knows exactly what it is to be trapped inside your own body!"" This man, possibly one of the absolute greatest dancers of all time understood the rage and helplessness of being denied control over his physical self. That's not acting, that is truth! O-Zeem-O-Shashensha!

Shernaz Patel, is one of my very favorites now. It's hard going up against two of the most amazingly beautiful and talented people in creation and play the guy's best dosti (friend) who also happens to be a woman. But Devyani is quite a wonderful dosti, and she reminds me of some of my many good guy-friends that I occasionally flirt with on a day when I need cheering up. Come to think of it, she also reminds me of my two tigress sisters. By the end of the movie I want her to hug me too! And I want a chai and gossip fest but... Yeah.

Suhel Seth, Scary brilliant! I have flashbacks to my childhood and a certain Doctor who absolutely refused to put up with my nonsense! Oh boy, I know the movie is in Hindi, but I rarely needed the subtitles to know what he was saying. I love watching him.

Okay I admit it, there is one major thing about this movie I'm not too keen on. Aditia Roy Kapoor, AKA: Omar, Omar, Omar, Omar! I don't know if I wasn't keen on Omar, or I just don't like the actor. I keep thinking to myself, ""why can't this guy be played by, Imram Khan, Neil Nitin Mukesh, or even Harman Bawjea!"" All of whom I like to watch so much more than Mr. Roy Kapoor. Omar, or more likely, the actor irritates me to no end. Thankfully, his seniors make him relatively obscure.

Special shout out to Mama Isobel! AKA Nafisa Ali, what a lady! As if I hadn't been crying enough she made me lose all control, and then she... whoops I won't spoil.

Music: UDI! Is just great, but Mr. Roshan ACTUALLY singing ""What A Wonderful World"" made me forget about Louis Armstrong for a split second. I think I might have committed a sin by saying it, but lying is a worse one. There are other amazing songs as well so Mr. Bhansali is also a great musical director. Even if he didn't believe his hero at first when he mentioned he could sing! Oh to be a fly on that wall, or nose.

I've rambled quite a bit, but this time it's personal. But then the best art challenges you and makes yourself aware of things in your heart you didn't know were there. This movie shows me something new about myself every time.",1361750400,3,11387,4.567302985805188

Cultural and ethnic differences can render some Hindi films puzzling and unintentionally goofy to a non-Indian, but the film Guzaarish transcends all cultural borders. This film is stunning. The cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are Oscar-worthy. It is the story of a master illusionist who, through an accident, becomes a quadraplegic. He soldiers on for 14 years only to come to the decision that he does not want to continue with such a straitjacketed life. Although this may sound dark and depressing, this film is actually a celebration of a profound love story between Ethan and his devoted nurse, Sophia. Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai bring an unbelievable beauty and chemistry to their roles, and are aided by finely drawn and beautifully realized supporting characters. Find this film and watch it! It's an absolute keeper. And, try to find other films directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. If you love lyrical cinema, you'll love his films.",1325548800,2,1060,5.132947976878612

This is the kind of movie magic that American movie makers have totally lost....the kind that inspires and captivates you.  Most everything they put out now is putrid and vile....

But Jill was right, don't let the topic of euthanasia keep you from watching this, because it really is a fantastic movie.  I usually don't like movies that try to persuade me to their political or moral philosophy, but Guzaarish treated the issue of suffering and ""right to die"" with some delicacy.  They didn't make it depressing. The movie was primarily about realizing the beauty of life IN SPITE of the problems, and trying to live it with dignity.

SWADES, BLACK, THE LAST LEAR, and even LUCK BY CHANCE are legitimately dramatic films that eschew traditional Indian cinema conventions. GUZAARISH, a lavish production, is cut from the same mold. GUZAARISH tells of an unusual love story. It's about the human spirit and how it perseveres in the face of hopelessness. GUZAARISH chronicles an ongoing courtroom battle in which a man strives to win the legal right to kill himself. So, no, you won't see guys like Govinda in this one.

GUZAARISH reunites Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai (from DHOOM 2 and JODHAA AKBAR), and these two actors put their souls into their performances; they light up the screen. For Roshan's character, Ethan Mascarenhas, it must be sheer torture. Once a celebrated stage magician who dazzled the masses, Ethan, fourteen years ago, suffered a calamitous accident during one of his acts which left him a paraplegic from the neck down. The stern Sofia D'Souza (Aishwarya Rai) has been Ethan's nurse for the past twelve years, tending to his needs, the one constant in his life. The playful Ethan can't resist tweaking her a bit, her and her exacting demeanor.

Ethan is a disc jockey nowadays, hosting the popular Radio Zindagi, broadcasting from his home. Ethan is one of them dudes what exudes a zest for life. But it's a charade. As the years have gone on, and Ethan sees no improvement to his paralysis, he's gradually surrendered, gradually given up. And, as we soon observe, he's prone to colossal fits of rage and melancholy. Ethan has folks who love him. His mother. His best friend. His nurse, although she won't admit it. Imagine their shock when, out of the blue, he ambushes them with the news that he's filing a petition at the Goa High Court for euthanasia. Except that the Indian legal system does not allow for euthanasia. And this is one of the central conflicts of the story: Ethan Mascarenhas' fight for the right to die. It'll prove to be an exhausting struggle.

This is a high concept movie. No one was gonna ef this up by introducing caricatured characters, insipid humor, or infantile plot threads. I think there are folks out there who regard Hrithik Roshan in much the same way folks used to regard Paul Newman and how they currently perceive a guy like, say, Brad Pitt. I just saw MONEY BALL, and Brad Pitt is a damn terrific actor. Except, I guess, some folks can't see past the glamour and the matinee idol looks. Roshan can act. He acted the hell out of this movie. The three things that you immediately take away from watching Hrithik Roshan are how handsome he is, how sculpted his physique, how talented he is as a dancer. This film restricts him to a wheelchair, confines him to bed. Except you notice his expressiveness even more, the sheer presence he has. Roshan boasts one of the most soulful gazes in the business. Flashbacks make us privy to several of Ethan Mascarenhas' magic acts, and they are marvelous feats of sleight-of-hand and they are presented stunningly. There is one amazing act during which he walks up a friggin' beam of light. I love the dreamlike, ethereal quality in these flashbacks. There are a few musical numbers scattered here and there and, in his dancing, Hrithik Roshan's mobility and fluidity are magnified. Contrast his physical grace with how, in the present day, he's slumped in a chair like an awful lump.

Aishwarya Rai has the less showy role, but this is one of her most solid performances, maybe her best since RAINCOAT. It's easy to be larger than life, more challenging to play it close to the vest, to be restrained and stoic and yet suggest the existence of layers. As Roshan is the best male dancer in Indian cinema in his era, so too is Aishwarya the female equivalent in hers. She struts her stuff somewhat in ""Udi."" I only wish it were more, and that Aishwarya had had a chance to really unleash her moves.

There's a tug of war in this film between earnestness and just a whiff of pretentiousness. And I do think that, in the end, Ethan's big closing argument in the Goa courthouse - which involves audience participation and one of his magic props - is telegraphed somewhat. But I appreciated what the film was going for, its themes of steadfastness and abiding love and a fight for independence and relishing life or however much is left in that hourglass. I appreciated the film's sincerity and the actors' unfettered commitment. There are moments here which may strike you as over-the-top. Except that Indian cinema is noted for its expansiveness and extravagance, and so what if some of that does seep into the film? It's part of the culture, folks being true to themselves. I respect that. And this is a good film, even a prestigious film. It's Bollywood trying to grow up.

The DVD's bonus features: the Making of GUZAARISH featurette (00:22:40 minutes long, and mostly in English); Deleted Scenes, including a sequence which was intended to follow what ended up being the film's closing scene (00:04:19 minutes); and the trailer and promos for the film.",1317859200,2,5176,4.777653631284916

4387009,5,B004IM2M70,"I am not a fan of Bollywood, as a matter of fact, Guzaarish was the third Bollywood film that I've watched in my entire life.  The first one I've watched while visiting a friend of Afghan origin. I thought that the Bollywood films with the energetic dancing and emotional outburst were a bit too much for my taste.  With all that said, imagine my delightful surprise to find out that Guzaarish was a Bollywood film!!

While searching Youtube, I've accidentally stumbled upon the song 'Smile' by composer Charlie Chaplin.  The haunting video clip moved me; so, I've decided to go ahead, 'take the plunge without the parachute'(quote/unquote by Ethan Macaranhea) and ordered the DVD.

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are exceptional gifted actors.  They can 'act' without much 'moving', the expression in their eyes, the shake of their heads, even the silence speaks and convey message.  The setting was meticulously done: the big mansion with its great halls, lots of green plants clinging to the fertile damp soil, metaphorised its owner's strive to live despise his condition. The music in the film was beautiful, haunting, sad and joy at the same time.  The climatic music at the revealation scene was poignantly done. Great cheer to director Sanjay Bhansali!

And the dancing!  Ah, what can I say? Hrithik Roshan is .. WOW! I was watching the movie when my mom walked in at the scene Hrithik danced to his magic act, and she asked 'Who is this great dancer?'. The way he has expressed himself through his dance movements is divine! a devotee to the performing art.  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's flamenco inspired dance was sensous, joyful, captivated and how's she executed those hand dance movements is beyond me!

I was enjoyed 'Guzaarish' with  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Hrithink Roshan so much that after I finished with 'Guzaarish', I searched and also ordered DVD 'Jodhaa Akbar' so that I enjoy their talent once again in different setting.",1315180800,5,1956,4.96319018404908
4387010,5,B004IM2M70,"Negatives:
None with the minor note that the Christian and Jewish scenes were not theologically explored more deeply and even seemed a bit  out of place. Would actually have liked to have seen more Hindi and Buddhist thought interjected into the discussion.

Positives:
(1.) An early indicator of a great film is ""attention to detail"" and this film had that from settings to props to dialogue nuances  to cinematography to script.
(2.) Clearly a western influence in the selection of the storyline, it's main topic and how that topic should be examined. However, clearly an Indian influence in the sensitivity given to this topic and how the actor's should define it.
(3.) The topic as you probably know by now is ""Death with dignity."" Defined with a few simple key phrases such as: ""Are the courts a party to someone ending their own life by permitting it.""  Not explored was that that argument fails even the most elementary rules of Aristotelian logic. Also, ""Can one be condemned to life against their own wishes?"" and ""Whose life is it?""
(4.) Also portrayed with great clarity in dealing with the end of life decision were scenes interwoven throughout defining what love, humor and trust are for the parties involved under these challenging circumstances.
(5.) The acting was superb beyond belief.",1305331200,4,1302,4.958715596330276

They are good together.  However, this film moved a little slowly for me and when you're watching a Bollywood film, which averages about 3 hours, you need it to be a bit more engrossing.  The acting is great.  The movie looks great.  The actors are stunning.  The plot is definitely different for Bollywood, which makes it interesting.  It just didn't keep my interest for long.",1300579200,,556,4.525252525252525

4387014,4,B004IM2M70,"Guzaarish is about a crippled musician living in a desolate mansion in Goa. A shadow of his glorious past Ethan is dependent on his full time nurse ( Aishwarya Rai), who has cared for him for the last 12 years. His disability does not stop him from hosting a radio show or writing a book. To everyone, he is a person who has conquered his disability and is living a full life. People, both closest and outsiders are shocked when he files a petition through his lawyer for Euthanasia. The movie tells us about Ethan's life both past and present through flashbacks and his fight to have the right to die.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali or SLB, has once again chosen a bleak topic to make a movie on. He is no stranger to such stories, having made films on deaf and mute people ( Khamoshi), Alzheimer's and blindness ( Black) and alcoholism ( Devdas). As in the past this is not an original story idea but has been inspired from other sources, for this movie SLB relies on the  movies, Sea Inside and Whose Life is it anyway, but has modified the script greatly and has set it in Goa. A complete entertainer, this movie had great music, dialogues, script, acting and direction.
Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai put in great performances and their chemistry, as it was in Jodhaa Akbar and Dhoom 2, is amazing. Hrithik has put in the best performance of his career and Rai supports his at every nuance. The rest of the cast is superb as well, including the people who have one minute roles. The music, one of the best of 2010, is melodious. Ek Tera Zikr, Saayba, 100 gram zindagi are some of the great tracks. They are choreographed and shot well, just watch Udi, featuring Aishwarya Rai to see what I mean. SLB has composed the music himself, shows that the man is supremely talented. The photography is marvelous and Goa looks beautiful. This is a top notch product and easily one of the best films of 2010. 4 stars. 1/31/11",1296777600,4,1912,4.478510028653295

He has the same zest for life Christopher Reeve always had.

I would highly recommend it to anyone. There are English subtitles but some of it is in English. The Hero has a radio show and plays american classic music from the 40's. The soundtrack is spectacular and not to be missed. The Female actresses are beautiful and talented.

Enjoy this one. I'm going to purchase it for my collection.",1296259200,16,643,4.487179487179487

While from a clinical stand point I do have a few issues with how certain ADL's and other care were provided to the patient overall this was a wonderful film.  Hrithik Roshan did an outstanding job with body language, and delivery of an almost evil sense of humor which is so typical of a para/quadraplegic.  So much of their humor is from frustration regarding their deficits.  He expressed the frustration and deep burden of life that is also dead on with the emotional state of a person who is capable of seeing the burden they present while yet knowing that the one caring for them does so out of love.  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also gave an outstanding performance.  Her love and care of her patient is evident while propriety still rules the day.  As a therapist I wish all my real-life patient's could be on the receiving end of that care. It is the sweetest kind of burden.  All in all this is a beautiful film and definitely worth watching.

8430831,5,B004IM2M70,"You will NEVER hear ""What a Wonderful World"" the same way again.

Our hero has become a quadriplegic because a jealous competitor caused a catastrophic accident while he was doing a magic trick. He has since become a popular radio host, using his charismatic voice and persona to build a huge following among his fans in India.

What no one suspects is he is harboring a deep-seated desire to be done with the pain, the inconvenience and the claustrophobic existence he has endured ever since the tragedy. His devoted nurse is sent away (only to be brutalized by her jealous husband) and our hero sets out on his next , and final, cause: Death with Dignity.

We hear both sides eloquently spoken and draw our own conclusions. I bought this DVD as soon as I heard ""What a Wonderful World"" on the copy I had borrowed from the library.
