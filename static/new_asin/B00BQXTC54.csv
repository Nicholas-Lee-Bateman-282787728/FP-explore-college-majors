5668025,5,B00BQXTC54,"Matthew McNulty's portrayal of the twin brothers in Honest is beautiful and very funny to watch.  First rate comic acting, and I have to remind myself sometimes that it is the same actor.  The contrast between the empty-headed ""Dude!?"" Vin and his sophisticated lawyer brother Taylor is a constant source of amusement.  Wonderful physical and comic acting.
Amanda Redman is very solid in this often very enjoyably raunchy series.  Not really to be taken very seriously, all the characters provide a lot of fun and interesting characterization, from the not as daft as he seems grandpa to the airheaded and narcissistic wannabe model and the young and guilelessly pervy constable.  The directing of some comic scenes is really masterful.
Yes, the plots and the writing are at times weak, but are made to work.
This really deserved another season at least.  Much less entertaining shows go on season after season.  I for one laughed constantly through these 6 episodes.  I am very glad it is available on Amazon Prime.",1388188800,,1016,4.970414201183432
5668026,2,B00BQXTC54,We waded through the pilot realizing how much must be accomplished in introducing characters and premises and hoping for a payoff with the next episode.  No such luck.  The second episode was tedious and lackluster.  It also stretched too thin any plausible suspension of disbelief.,1386633600,2,282,5.222222222222222
5668027,3,B00BQXTC54,"This show is about a train wreck of a family.
Sort of a chav version of Goodfellas.
Def not for kids.",1386460800,,101,3.857142857142857
5668028,3,B00BQXTC54,"The original New Zealand version ""Outrageous Fortune"" is superior is every way.  Amanada Redmen holds her own but there is nothing like the original cast and production for comedy and drama.",1385424000,3,190,5.129032258064516
5668029,3,B00BQXTC54,"This is a very unusual concept, but was well done.  It's biggest drawback is the use of language and lost morality of her family, as she struggles, successfully, to turn their lives around.  We would like to have seen more shows in an effort to communicate the outcome of the family.  Ok ... but not up to Midsommer, Foyle's War, or New Tricks.",1380672000,,344,4.428571428571429
5668030,5,B00BQXTC54,I now have nine seasons and they continue to exhibit the humor and of course mystery that I have come to expect,1373500800,4,111,4.090909090909091

5668032,5,B00BQXTC54,Very funny with a super cast and good writers. I can hardly wait for season 2 if there is to be one.,1414454400,,100,3.590909090909091
5668033,5,B00BQXTC54,I didn't think I could get thru the first episode after hearing the British accents but I toughed it out. To my surprise it was a very entertaining and I do recommend it.,1413676800,,170,4.181818181818182
5668034,4,B00BQXTC54,Very good show,1412812800,,14,4.0
5668035,5,B00BQXTC54,"Great show. I was sorry that there wasn't a 2nd series. Amanda Redman was cast perfectly for this part. Great fun. Highly recommend if you are looking for a different, yet very funny adult comedy show.",1412553600,,201,4.611111111111111
5668036,5,B00BQXTC54,This is another great series - I wish there were more,1411948800,,53,3.909090909090909
5668037,5,B00BQXTC54,Excellent,1411430400,,9,9.0
5668038,3,B00BQXTC54,"The show is overall funny and has promise. However the plot line is stalled and repetitive. Will the gil ever have a credible shot at modeling, the other sitter: will she become the head of the family; the twins, well they both of their plot lines are just CLUELESS. The mother's storyline has great potential as it comes to running a crime family or going straight and benefiting from that. Also, you know she is going to hook up with the detective, so please do it already - to throw his wife in there and then nothing happen was just a let down.

I wanted to give it a higher rating because I came across it by accident and the first episode hooked me. The second was good, the third was blah..you get where I am going. I didn't even finish. Not even the sex-switch=up confusion of the twins could save it. Wanted to love it...slow pace and uninspired script...it's ok",1411171200,,871,4.409937888198757

5668040,3,B00BQXTC54,Never thought I would get into a show from the UK. But not bad. Had some real funny times and also some real life stuff. Life in the UK is so like here in the US.,1410480000,,162,3.5277777777777777
5668041,4,B00BQXTC54,I enjoyed the series and wish there were more than 6 episodes! I really liked the characters. It was a bit predictable yet still enjoyable.,1410048000,,139,4.6
5668042,4,B00BQXTC54,"I really enjoyed watching this family ...led by Amanda Redman, who I would watch in anything. It was a bit silly & predictable but a fun light comedy romp...too bad there are only 6 episodes.",1408233600,3,191,4.485714285714286

5668050,4,B00BQXTC54,"I must say that I was drawn to the show because I enjoy Amanda Redman and her team on New Tricks. What a great series that was! The plot line of Honest is a familiar one of a mobster's family trying be like ""normal"" people, but it ain't gonna happen. Good acting. It would say your should view it to see what Amanda Redman can do in a different role. Four stars because the plot is a little too familiar.",1401667200,,404,4.0625
5668051,5,B00BQXTC54,L really liked this series.  The characters are interesting.  The problem is that too many stories were left open. Would be nice to know what happened.,1399161600,,151,4.769230769230769
5668052,5,B00BQXTC54,This family is totally dysfunctional (but in a creative way).  Mom tries to keep them going - it's pretty much impossible.,1398816000,,122,4.809523809523809
5668053,4,B00BQXTC54,"I found it easy to watch and get into. The characters were silly in a good way.  Clearly, from the hanging story lines, they had hoped for another season, as had I.",1398470400,,164,4.125

5668055,5,B00BQXTC54,Absolutely love this show. Why aren't there more seasons? Great show just didn't wrap it up nicely at the end,1397520000,,109,4.5
5668056,4,B00BQXTC54,"This show is  consistently funny. The writing is very imaginative and always surprising. Amanda Redman is an actress deserving of greater recognition. She's also excellent in the series ""New Tricks"".",1396656000,,199,5.633333333333334
5668057,4,B00BQXTC54,"this is fun clever series with engaging characters and generally fine performances ... the plot is smart, altho once it gets going and the premise is established it gets a little predictable, but there are still fun surprises ... biggest drawback seems to be there is NO Season 2, or any subsequent seasons...that's too bad, i'd keep watching",1395619200,2,342,4.913793103448276
5668058,5,B00BQXTC54,Loved this show. Sharp witted and enjoyable!! The characters were perfect. I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. Great show!!!,1395360000,,131,5.6
5668059,4,B00BQXTC54,"This is good comedy. Keeps you laughing. Laura is great eye candy, and ought to compare a DNA test with Angelina Jolie. I'll bet the result would be a common ancestor long after the baboon. This is a great story line and, as far as I know, completely original. Give these guys a break and watch this. You will get good entertainment for your money.",1393804800,,348,4.369230769230769
5668060,4,B00BQXTC54,Redmon is very good in this as are the supporting cast.  Not up to many of the British crime series but worth watching although I doubt you will want to binge watch it.,1393804800,,168,4.090909090909091

5668062,4,B00BQXTC54,"I have just started watching this series and am up to the 3rd one.  So far it has held my interest in the way a good band can play a famous bands songs.  Refreshing, different pace, but still the same song. I like the new bands take on the music so to speak and hope to continue enjoying the show.  I normally would have waited to finish the series before reviewing but there are few reviews at the moment. If things change I will edit this as needed.",1393372800,,451,4.1022727272727275
5668063,2,B00BQXTC54,This show is EXACTLY like the far superior Outrageous Fortune series. I highly recommend you invest your time in that show as opposed to this. The acting in this show is stiff and not very believable.,1393027200,3,200,4.583333333333333
5668064,1,B00BQXTC54,It was horrid! Do not recommend anyone watching this it fails at any form of comedy. Truly the worst show.,1392163200,2,106,4.35
5668065,1,B00BQXTC54,It only took me ten minutes to decide I had made a terrible choice.  No.  I would not recommend this.,1391990400,,101,4.0
5668066,4,B00BQXTC54,Very interesting concept but as most shows these days it always ends in sex. I enjoy a good old sexless show.,1390953600,,109,4.238095238095238

5668068,4,B00BQXTC54,"It is good as the plot develops for changes in Lindsay to become honest, and Evan as becoming a leader...  It's humourous and a little predictable , yet I like it.",1390089600,,163,4.258064516129032

This was really funny (too racy for kids, though) and it has subtitles which my husband needs as he does not hear well - so that was a plus.  We both loved it, loved the actors and actresses but want it to go on and I cannot find series two anywhere.
