8378221,5,B002R0EUI4,"Glad i ordered this dvd. It cleared up alot of confusion about my forthcoming trip to Rome. I have read a couple of travel books on Rome, but this dvd was clear and concise about touring Rome. Don't leave for Rome without viewing it.",1288310400,2,233,4.318181818181818
8378222,5,B002R0EUI4,"The video was really great.  We watched it several times before departing for our trip to Rome, and it really gave us great insight into selecting what we wanted to see while there, so we didn't waste any time.  Additionally, their web site, which is provided with the DVD, was extremely helpful with answering any and all questions I sent them.  I must have sent them 10 e-mails with questions to help me on the trip, and they responded to each and every one, within no more than a day, and the response was usually a full page or two.  Really great.",1287705600,,551,4.372549019607843
8378223,1,B002R0EUI4,"I have a passion for Rome and have shared it with 11 grandchildren...so far.  Lucaya Luckey is a charming young woman, and I wanted her to be a good guide.  And after reading the above reviews, I couldn't wait to watch the video.  Such a disappointment!

Lucaya talks very fast, and moves from one site/subject to another without taking a breath, or allowing her audience to do the same.  The maps and the photos (quite good) fly by, but, for some reason, we are well-versed on the exact measurements of each site. There are cute little stories to lighten the frantic history, but it's like someone rushing you through the city double-stepping all the way, pulling you by the elbow and filling your ear with numbers.

Most disappointing of all was her appalling pronunciation of Italian names of people and places.  Heaven help any of you who repeat some of them to a Roman cabbie, who will have no idea where you want to go.  (I know from experience!)  The worst was more than pronunciation; she called the Emperor Geta by the name Gela, and it was even spelled that way on screen.  If that's a variation, I have yet to find it.  There were a few facts that are questionable, but often repeated in popular guide books, so I guess I can forgive her that; I've certainly done the same if a good story will catch the grandkids' interest.  All in all, however, I won't trust any of the few new facts I learned from Passage to Roma before I check them out.

Because Lucaya is so likeable and eneergetic, I must add that I don't really blame her.  For all we know, she writes nothing herself, but merely reads from a script.  Well, they should have somebody check it before they take your money.  And please, please, slow the pace.  Will I give this to the next grandchild to watch before we go?  I had hoped to, but no...Rome deserves better.",1252022400,,1838,4.468468468468468
8378224,4,B002R0EUI4,"This is a very good DVD if you intend to travel to Rome or would just like to learn more about the city. It contains three ""tours"" that take in most of the major sites, plus many places that are not well known. It was obviously done very recently, as they have included information on some sites, like the Roman Forum, that has happened in just the last few months. The narrator goes into great detail on many wonderful places in the city, in some cases maybe too much detail, but I'd always prefer more over less. It is like having your own personal guide.

It is not just a DVD, there is also a website ([...]) that goes along with it. On the website you can download, for free, all kinds of really useful information about Rome. They even have a free MP3 audio guide that is the soundtrack from the DVD. From what they say, they are making a fourth tour that will be available for download on their website. Oh, I almost forgot, on the website they even have a free tour guide book taken from the video script that you can download, take to your local office copy store and have it printed and bound.",1251244800,2,1103,4.277511961722488
8378225,5,B002R0EUI4,"I purchased this video from another site and was very impressed with how it was done. I am so tired of seeing travel videos that show a bunch of bars or hotels. This was obviously created by people who either live in Rome or really know the city. You go on ""tours"" with this very nice young lady.

The narrator provides such great detail, then tells you exactly how to get from one site to the next. When I went to their website I was amazed at all of the information they have compiled. This has made my trip planning a joy. I probably will not follow their exact tours, but will mix parts of one with another. This is easy, because they also have Google Maps showing all the sites.

I am always nervous about using public transportation in strange cities. Not with this company. They actually have selected bus routes laid out that can take you almost anywhere you want to go.

The video is very nice and well worth the price. I would advise this for anyone thinking of taking a trip to the Eternal City.",1248825600,4,1006,4.3121693121693125
8378226,5,B002R0EUI4,"This DVD contains three tours led by this very knowledgeable and beautiful hostess, Lucaya. I lost count of the number of sites she visits. She gives you information and history that brings the video to life. You don't just see the biggie sites, she also takes you to places you probably never heard of. What makes it great are the stories behind the sites. Like the ongoing battles between Bernini and Boromini.

To top it off, you then can go to the free website they have for so much more information. Everything from how to use the buses, to how to skip ticket lines and how to save lots of money. Plus you can download the MP3 files to take with you for your own audio tour guide and it even has a guidebook.

I don't think I have ever seen a video tour guide like this. The quality of the video is pretty good, but there are a few places it could be better. There are some sites that I wish they went into even more detail, but I understand that you can only do just so much, it is already over an hour and a half long.

Buy this one if you want the best. I wish I had it a few years ago when I first visited, but I'm glad I've got it now for my next visit. Now I'll know what I'm looking at and how to get around this sometimes confusing city.

Oh, I almost forgot, here is the link to their free website, if nothing else, use this for all the free info...
