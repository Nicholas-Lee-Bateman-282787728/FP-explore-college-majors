8548701,5,B00A96FK3C,"This movie indeed achieved the Writer's goal to mature and put a closure at Regine and Aga loveteam. This put to the top from their last two movies. I am glad this was made for us who loves to see Regine and Aga on the silver screen. I definitely agree with the movie theme song liner ""i think i'll start and end with loving you"", it is what I felt after watching this movie.",1360972800,,375,4.081081081081081
