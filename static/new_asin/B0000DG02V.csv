8001017,5,B0000DG02V,"Viewed this a couple of times before traveling to Vegas and was able to play craps without any problem. Glad that I purchased it because prior to returning to vegas recently, I watched it again and it helped freshen me for another round at the casinos. This will give you a good explanation of the craps table and how to bet. I followed the advice to bet on the pass line, take the odds, and follow that with no more than 2 come bets. Came back a winner (over $1k) on both trips. Worth the price of the video!",1396915200,5,509,4.151515151515151
