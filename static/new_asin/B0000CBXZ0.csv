7998668,5,B0000CBXZ0,"The program is 1-hour. It pretty much follows the story from beginning to end of what it says about Paul in the Book of Acts (the only book of the New Testament that tells a historical account of what happened after Jesus' death), but includes archival and archaelogical history too. In the end credits it has the date in roman numerals as (1997). It is supposedly narrated by Ben Kingsley. I thought it was a very good telling of the story, with historical tie-in to other historical things we know about the time period.  The DVD also has a Bonus feature that is 1-hour long, entitled 'First Martyrs in Rome'(1991) hosted by Joseph Campanella. I rented my copy from my online video store, which is why this won't show I purchased it from Amazon.",1342137600,,747,4.574626865671642
