2378994,5,B000A7Q1XS,"Had it not been for my kids watching The Amanda Show on satellite tv I would not have caught an episode of the Amanda Show and found out why they were always laughing so hard. I have to admit that her comedic timing and facial expressions are truly entertaining and off the wall. Amanda is an inspiration to my youngest daughter, who hopes to carry as much spunk and charisma as Amanda does. It's good to see that good clean fun is still being offered these days and I would highly recommend these DVDs for family viewing and a hardy escape from the work-a-day world into hilarious hijinx.",1163030400,6,589,4.462962962962963
2378995,5,B000A7Q1XS,"OK, OK, I'm twenty three years old. I was introduced to this show, via my friend's four year old daughter, but now I watch it for my own enjoyment purposes. The show is hillarious, the best thing to come out of Nickelodeon since You Can't Do THat On Television, which is greatly missed I might add... when are they going to release that on DVD?
First of all Amanda Bynes is a cute teen chick, without all the BS surrounding her, like dear, does she have a studio album yet? I don't think so! She has a very lively persona, that is perfect to center this sketch comedy show for kids around. Good crazy fun. Instead of selling sex, she sells fart jokes and country hick-billy jokes, very well. Her numerous recurring characters are all a bunch of fun, and the supporting cast is also very talented, the Drake and Josh kids are pretty hip as well in their own show. Great for kids of all ages.

P.S> to the kids who don't remember You Can't DO That On Television, I'm very sorry. Nickelodeon stopped airing it about twelve years ago, but it was the most rock and roll show ever! Anyway, The Amanda Show doesn't air new shows either, I'm well aware... but at least there are still repeats and a DVD. I am happy to know that there are still hip shows for kids, because I really get scared sometimes for the future crop of kids, and a pussified, saturated world.",1137369600,12,1356,4.359683794466403
2378996,5,B000A7Q1XS,"I seen What I like about you, the show is compared to The Gilmore Girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Related. Val and Holly are like Lorelai and Rory Gilmore and Buffy and Dawn Summers. Jennie Garth has the greatest resemblance of The O.C.'s Mischa Barton. Amanda Bynes has the greatest resemblance of 7th Heaven Jessica Biel, Katie Holmes and The O.C.'s Rachel Bilson. Tom Cruise can mistake her for Katie Holmes. I always think Amanda Bynes should of married Tom Cruise not Katie Holmes. Nick Zano has the greatest resemblance of Angel's David Boreanaz. Vince and Holly are like Buffy and Angel on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Wesley Jonathan is compared to Will Smith. If he ever did an action movie he would done Bad Boys, better than him. Leslie Erin Grossman is compared to Urma Thurman. That's no lie, she really does look like Urma Thurman. Allison Munn has the greatest resemblance of Paris Hilton and Grammy award winner Christina Aguilera. Dan Cortese looks like N'Sync Lance Bass. Tell you the truth Justin Timberlake can mistake him for Lance Bass, that is no joke. Lauren and Tina are like the cynical and worried best friends of Val and Holly. Amanda Bynes might someday win an Oscar anytime soon. If she did, she never forget where she came from. If Amanda Bynes ever was on Buffy, she probably would have gone for Angel or Spike. If Amanda Bynes was on American Pie, she probably would have gone for Steve Stifler. Amanda Bynes has whole new road to go through. Jennie Garth looks like she was eighteen or ninteen. Even though she is 33 she looks like she looks like she was eighteen or ninteen than 33. Amanda Bynes might be ninteen she looks like she was 24 or 25.",1131667200,3,1681,4.6066666666666665

8075967,5,B000A7Q1XS,"I miss this show and when I received this product, it was in good shape. I did not have any problems with the DVDs.",1389916800,,115,3.8333333333333335
8075968,3,B000A7Q1XS,"Nickelodeon released the Amanda show but not kenan and kel show and all that season.  1-6
so please nickelodeon release all that and kenan & kel show I miss watching it and also want to re live my child hood one last time
the reason I said that it is because they don't make shows like no more , and since they stopped doing re runs long time ago
they might of just re lease a DVD !",1299801600,,382,3.8974358974358974
8075969,2,B000A7Q1XS,"I just received these dvds in the mail. And I am very unsatisfied! It looks like something you would rent from the public library. The dvd cases are very badly dented and old. And the dvds themselves are scratched. Its obvious that I received USED dvds. No where on here does it say that they are supposed to be used. In fact, it says ""NEW""!!!!!!!! I want to know what is going on, considering I purchased it from amazon, and not an independent seller. That being said, I give it 2 stars only because the Amanda Show is a great show.",1295481600,,533,4.287128712871287
8075970,5,B000A7Q1XS,"Anyone who like or LOVED the Amanda Show as a tween will want to get these DVD's. Because Nick never released the complete 46 episodes to the public these DVD's (also available in VHS format) are you closest shot to having high quality standard-definition in the palm of your hand.

They have extra features that give you a new view on the show. Not amazing, but they're a valiant effort to whomever created these videos.

Anyone who is a fan of ""Moody's Point"" will be upset to find the series uncompleted. Youtube has all your needs though, but not with the personal quality these disks offer.",1283472000,,595,4.60377358490566
8075971,5,B000A7Q1XS,this show is awesome and i just wish that they had more DVDs of it. amanda and the rest of the cast is really funny in this show and i wish they still played it on TV.,1261785600,,167,3.5405405405405403
8075972,4,B000A7Q1XS,"I remember when I was little and they were still showing re-runs, I didn't want to watch The Amanda Show, Unfabulous, etc. because they were on TEENick, and I didn't think mommy and daddy would want me to watch TEENick.

However, one day this year, I told myself now that I was 14 and TEENick didn't really turn out to be TEENick, just regular Nick, I was going to watch the supposedly ""Teen"" Nick shows, so I started with The Amanda Show.

Anyway, onto the movie...

I won't be reviewing the TV show this time, but I will be reviewing the DVDs themselves.

Amanda, Please! contains episodes 214, 217, 222, and 226.

The G irls' Room contains episodes 216, 219, 224, and 228.

Each contains outtakes and Behind-The-Scenes Features.

However, since they skip several episodes in between and before/after, it's hard for somebody new to the show to really get into it. Nickelodeon really needs to release seperate DVDs for each season.

If you do like the Amanda Show though, be sure to buy it. :) Just keep in mind they don't have all the episodes (and are a little out of order) when buying them. :)",1255737600,7,1098,4.538071065989848
