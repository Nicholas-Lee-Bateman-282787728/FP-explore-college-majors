7952184,5,B00005RG6L,"The only thing that got murdered in this movie was the fine art of acting. This movie was so bad that i suspect that it is now a required item in the CIA interrogation kit. Why did I give it 4 stars you ask? The answer to that question is a complicated one. You see it stars John Taylor of Duran Duran and I could never mark any item that John Taylor is in down. So you see I am actually giving John Taylor 4 stars, but not the movie or any of this so called acting. Seriously this movie is bad. Don't buy it. Really  . . .don't do it",1409443200,,534,3.810810810810811
7952185,3,B00005RG6L,"Movie was ok could have been MUCH better, Erika Eleniak was great as always, and Brenda Epperson Doumani is definitely right up there with Eleniak, it was great to see Steve Rossi from the  old comedy team of Allen and Rossi his performance was excellent,  the director should have capitalized on one of his cast members Michael A. Tessiero, needed to see more of him,  this guy is turning up everywhere , has great screen presents, can't put him in a scene with any leading men  though, if you do viewers will be wondering why Tessiero is not the star. All in all it was entertaining.",1056240000,2,585,4.490566037735849
7952186,3,B00005RG6L,"When I got this film, I bought Four Dogs Playing Poker as a Amazon.com deal. Vegas: City of Dreams had a very interesting plot in the beginning of the film but it slowly declined. I felt like I was watching a soft-core porno-soap. It seems casting wasn't the best... they probably went to every strip joint in Vegas and said to every stripper, ""Hey, ya want to be in a movie?"" I am a huge John Taylor fan and I was thrilled to hear he got one of the lead roles, but I was very disappointed because his acting wasn't the best. If you are a down-right fan of one of the actors in the movie, buy it... but don't buy it out of curiousity. Sorry, John.",1049155200,5,647,4.102362204724409
7952187,3,B00005RG6L,"This advertizes as being in the spirit of 'Charlies Angels' and 'The X-files' but is a low budget affair throughout. 3 sisters return home at X-mas only to find their 4th murdered and they want to know why. The 4 do not even remotely look related but if you are an Erika Eleniak fan, she gets lots to do and delivers her lines with professional zeal throughout.",1036800000,8,361,4.402985074626866
