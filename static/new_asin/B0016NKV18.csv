3161852,2,B0016NKV18,"When will someone make a movie about The Bell Witch that actually follows the true story?
Please! Someone do that for us!

This movie is absolutely horrible! It barely follows the writings of Richard Williams Bell,or the historical facts about the hauntings.
Why do people think they have to dramatically over-embellish a true story that is already totally scary, and at the same time,they think it's fine to take away as many facts about it as they possibly can?

Even the date of the haunting was wrong, as it didn't happen in one year, it actually happened over a period of about four years,and Betsy was only about twelve, not fifteen, or however old they have her in this movie.

They wasted so much time on the love story of Betsy and Joshua, and no time on the many things the spirit did during the period of the attacks, and totally forgot all the facts.

Did none of the people who wrote and produced this movie even bother to read the many factual written accounts?
I have studied the story for a long time now, and was completely appalled with this version of it on DVD.

And why is Lucy Bell so much older than John Bell in the movie? She was actually  more than twenty years younger than her husband, and he was over sixty years old when the hauntings happened,not forty!

Some people here say that it actually followed the written accounts closely, but I beg to differ, as there was very little in this movie that was even near factual. If you want a much better version of the story on DVD, buy 'The Bell Witch Haunting', as it is much better done, and does follow better the facts about the Bell Witch, except in a very few respects.

Please, someone make a version of the story that is truly a factual account and read and follow the story, as written by Richard Williams Bell, as I really wasted my money on this, and am highly disappointed, and would love to have a movie that is truly a fact based account!

3161853,1,B0016NKV18,"Bell Witch is a great story and fodder for a well made movie. This production ain't it.

Bell Witch The Movie is poorly written and hardly directed at best. The acting is as good as can be expected given the dismal direction. The sets are great but blocked and shot like a rank beginner on blow.

I gave up after slogging through 3/4's of this really  unwatchable production.

Someday somebody will do justice to this interesting myth turned cottage industry for the region's tourists.

This DVD is nothing but overpriced hype.

Stay away lest you haunt yourself with ""...why, why did I buy?""",1231286400,3,592,4.699029126213592
3161854,2,B0016NKV18,"I recently visited the Bell Witch Cave in Adams, Tennessee. The only other movie I've seen related to this was the horrible An American Haunting, which basically turned it into a tale of incest. They had this movie for sale at the Cave for $30, which seemed a bit much, so when I got home I checked Amazon and got it much, much cheaper.

It was STILL a waste of money! (And thank goodness I didn't get bilked for 30 bucks!) Everything about this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong.

First of all, they got none of the ""facts"" of the story right. The dates are wrong, the characters are the wrong ages, the timeline is off and they invented all sorts of add-ons to the story that were never reported by any of the accepted tellers of the tale. For example, John Bell was 67 years old when the hauntings began. His wife as 20 years younger than he was. They had eight children. In the movie, John looks hardly 40, has a nice contemporary haircut, and his wife looks older than he does. They have three children and condense several years of story into less than one. They tip-toe around the supposed dispute between Kate Batts and Bell, making it have something to do with a dispute over the purchase of some land. It was really over the interest charged for the purchase of a slave. (There are no black people in this movie at all!)

Next, it was shot in high-definition video (Sony 24P), but instead of taking advantage of this camera's incredible cinematic range, they lit it like most amateurs videographers light video. Everything is flat, bright and over-exposed. And even though a year goes by, it's always autumn - I guess because orange and brown leaves look cool in high-def.

The acting is is horrid. I think this is primarily the fault of the direct/screenwriter, because the words he put into their mouths are stilted and he lets them get away with saying them awkwardly. Most of the roles are totally mis-cast and the performances are completely over-the-top. Imagine community theater where everyone is playing to the last row. It's not quite THAT good.

And lastly, in many ways this whole movie is just an excuse for a soundtrack full of annoying bluegrass music. (The director also produced the music.) It's not period - it's very contemporary - and scenes go on and on and on so that the whole song can play to its end. They push the CD in the previews before the film starts and actually go so far as to say ""it has been compared to O Brother"". I can only assume it was compared by the director in order to try and convince people to buy it. Yeah, it's sort of the same style, but that's about it.

There is one fright in the entire movie. A scary image appears in a window during a lightning flash. You hear a loud nose. That's it! The rest of the time you are supposed to be afraid of some strange green light - and it doesn't work.

This is rank amateur work and you will be disappointed.",1219622400,14,2903,4.425093632958801

What I really liked about it was the old school style of editing and wipes and after reading the ""Red Book"" this movie is almost 100% dead on and the best Bell Witch film I have seen.
I don't know where they shot this film but the scenery is amazing, it looks like Tennessee in the 1800's and with Betsy Palmer as the Bell Witch's voice it gave me goose bumps! (I am a huge Friday the 13th fan)
The soundtrack rocked and went along with the film great.

3396368,4,B0016NKV18,I've had this movie and soundtrack for a couple of years. Enjoyed the true story and I love the soundtrack. Good movie for this tine of year.  Not a horror movie but a good ghost story!,1505865600,,185,4.138888888888889

3396370,5,B0016NKV18,This is my kind of horror film. What makes this film so great is this is a true story. The filmmaker kept the story very close to the authenticated historical Bell Witch phenomenon.,1505433600,,181,4.515151515151516
3396371,4,B0016NKV18,"I loved this movie even though there was a few small errors like John Bell had 5 children in real life and in the movie he only had 3 but that didn't take away from the story any, all in all this was spot on with the legend. I would recommend it. This is not really a horror movie more like Little House on the Prairie meets Poltergeist so if you are looking for a slasher, bloody film this is not it.",1505347200,,401,3.902439024390244
3396372,5,B0016NKV18,My high school English teacher portrayed Joshua Gardner!! I remember watching this movie in the ninth grade. I loved this movie so much.,1504569600,,136,4.956521739130435
8263523,2,B0016NKV18,"I grew up near Adams, Tennessee and learned of the Bell Witch at an early age.  We toured the grounds before all the commercialization of the Bell Witch.  The cave was an open cave, no admission price with a steel gate securing the entrance.  The current owner saw us wondering the property and gave us a great tour of the cave, the well, and location of the Bell house.  The old well still existed and the family grave yard was open to anyone as most grave yards are today.  The movie was generally accurate, but had added things to make it more entertaining.  I haven't been back there in over 45 years, but would love to drive through the area again one day to see how much it has grown and changed.  We did have an erie experience there one afternoon/evening.  There was a old house on the property, abandoned for years. As we were outside and it was getting dark, we saw a greenish glow coming through the windows of a room on the second floor.  Sounds of an old fashioned party with fiddle music could faintly be heard coming from the room.  We didn't hang around to investigate, jumped in the car and hauled it out of there.  Years later in the military I found a book on the Bell Witch at the library with pictures in the center divider.  One of them was of the caretaker who said ""I've seen a strange greenish glow out of that old house on several occasions.""  Makes the little hairs on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about it.",1514764800,,1448,4.2988929889298895
8263524,2,B0016NKV18,"I watched this movie because I thought I was getting the ""true"" story of the Bell Witch, which we did not get with the terribly disjointed 'An American Haunting'.  If, as one reviewer states, the argument with John Bell was really over a slave, then why didn't they just say that in the movie?  The son falls into a cave in this film, finds a dead body, and takes these jeweled hatpins that were stuck in her. That is never explained in the movie at all.  Nothing is explained - why the haunting, why the neon green light, why the 'woman' who looks like a little girl, if the fat woman put the curse on Bell or why.  I didn't even see Betsy Palmer.  I did enjoy the colors, but why was it always fall?  It's a mess of a movie.  If someone is going to make a movie about a true event, why can't they be as historically accurate as possible?  We're not idiots, you know.",1514764800,,868,4.155688622754491
8263525,1,B0016NKV18,It is my understanding this film had a 3 Million plus production budget.  If that is correct then I can write emphatically that this was and is the biggest waste of money that anyone has ever spent.  There are many variables that make a good movie and not one of those variables are achieved in this film.  Yes there was decent cinematography but any person with a decent camera could have pulled that off.  The casting and acting from the start to finish was an absolute joke.  I can't imagine any of these people advancing their careers using this film on a resume.  The worst part of this film is the dialogue and emphasis on southern red neck drama.  This film could pass for a school production at best and in fact I thought that is what this was until I saw the budget provided for the film.  The biggest joke of the day is the person or persons that laid out the money for this film.... Hee Hawww Heee Hawwww Heee Hawww! Jack Ass!,1513728000,,937,4.314285714285714
8263526,1,B0016NKV18,"Didnt watch more than 5 minutes, huge disappointment....special effects and acting were a joke",1510876800,,94,5.785714285714286
8263527,2,B0016NKV18,great plot but the acting was horrible,1509408000,,38,4.571428571428571
8263528,3,B0016NKV18,"The acting and costumes - not so great.  The music was not so good either.  For some reason I watched it to the end, the best part of this movie.",1509321600,,145,3.8
8263529,2,B0016NKV18,"Without all the filler of music, song (not the same here), and unnecessarily MORE than sufficient scenes, this would be a mildly entertaining Twilight Zone episode (half-hour long & made for TV)!!  As a movie, all youd have to add, would be a few music albums that you actually WANT to hear, and a scenery travelogue.  Sorry, but youd have to get better acting, writing (or abbreviation), and less bad-filler, to make this a good movie (i.e. three-star rating).  It CAN be used as a background for some other useful activity like chopping wood or sawing logs.",1509235200,,559,4.742268041237113

8263531,4,B0016NKV18,"In my opinion much better than an american haunting. I didn't care much for the music, also seemed a lot of music. Story seemed much more realistic to history.",1508889600,,159,4.517241379310345
8263532,2,B0016NKV18,"Great picture quality and awesome Tennessee countryside.  Beautiful.  However, that's where it stops.  Cheezy story, awful acting and bad casting.  If I didn't know any better I would have thought they were the Clampets from Beverely Hillibillies.  Ma, pa, youngins.  OMG.  What a waste of a beautiful picture set in an ideal location.  The soundtrack and singing was extremely good, and Only reason I watched it until the end.  As far as the story goes, poor, po, John Bell got himself buried alive by the Bell Witch making him seem dead when he wasn't.",1508544000,,554,4.808510638297872
