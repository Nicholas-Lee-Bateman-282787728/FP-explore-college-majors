7797460,4,157252197X,"This Court TV film documents the trial of Colin Ferguson, the infamous shooter of 26 people on a Long Island Railroad commuter train in 1993. Ferguson was allowed to represent himself at his jury trial, despite being clearly delusional. The resultant media circus is a vivid example of the practical implications of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1993 ruling in Godinez v. Moran, which made it easier for courts to find defendants competent to stand trial. (Ferguson, for example, is seen arguing that he was charged with 93 offenses because the year was 1993.) Although this was a big case, many viewers on the West Coast missed it because the O.J. trial was going on at the same time. The video includes key testimony and interviews with attorneys, jurors, and others involved in the case. For anyone who is interested in this topic, it makes for lively viewing. I show it to my students in a graduate course on competency in the legal system, and I find it highly relevant for that purpose.",1169424000,3,987,4.744186046511628
