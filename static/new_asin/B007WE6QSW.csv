8522521,5,B007WE6QSW,"Years ago, I was overwhelmed with joy to have gotten a fair-to-watchable vhs bootleg of this concert (in part) from a private source. But to have later acquired this stunning high quality transfer to dvd years later is more than I could have hoped for. I caught a number of in-person Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers concerts with Lee Morgan, as well as those with Morgan later leading his own groups. To add to the comments from another reviewer re: Lee Morgan's incredible ability at just age 20, to have such complete command over his instrument was mind-boggling. Morgan's muted story-telling solo on ""Goldie"" alone, is worth more than the price of this dvd. And Wayne Shorter's solos are also priceless. I never tire of watching this dvd, and hope it will never go out of print for the sake of future Jazz enthusiasts.",1445040000,2,825,4.696551724137931
8522522,5,B007WE6QSW,"Put yourself in a time machine and travel back to 1959.  This DVD is a musical and visual treasure of the music that changed the world of jazz.  This group of Jazz Messengers is comprised of Lee Morgan, trumpet; Wayne Shorter, sax; Walter Davis, Jr, Piano, Jymie Merrett, bass; and of course, Art Blakey on drums. Songs are: 1. ""Are you real?"" , 2. What Know(a/k/a Goldie) 3. No Problem, 4. Bouncing with Bud, 5. Close Your Eyes 6. Along Came Betty, 7. Blues March, 8. Night in Tunisia.
At this time in 1959, Blakey's Messengers introduced 2 new members: Saxophonist, Wayne Shorter (who is now a household name)and Walter Davis, Jr, pianist who has so much to offer this group.  Lee Morgan burns it up throughout the entire concert and Jymie Merritt works the bass with much soul and lan.
The sound and picture quality are quite good considering the age.  So. If this is any indication  of the other ""Jazz Icons"" on Mosaic, then sign me up for more.",1376092800,5,949,4.526315789473684
8522523,5,B007WE6QSW,"Art Blakey discovered more jazz artists than anyone in the history of jazz. Wayne Shorter and Lee Morgan are but two of those greats. Mr. Blakey is at his drumming best on this DVD, as are Wayne and Lee.",1342656000,,203,4.230769230769231
