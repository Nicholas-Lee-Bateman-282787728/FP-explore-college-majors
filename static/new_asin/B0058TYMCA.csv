The film begins with a man sitting and waiting. Another comes to join him. Then a third man, and they ride into town. People notice them. Pierce, Miller, and Colby ask about the train schedule. Will Kane and Amy Fowler wed. Kane is the Town Marshal, but intends to quit. A telegram brings news of Frank Miller's pardon! [Some kind of payoff in those days?] Kane is advised to leave town. [Can every problem be avoided as a solution?] No, Kane decides to return; he doesn't even have a gun! [Unbelievable.] Kane could never be safe as long as those four were after him. ""I'm not trying to be a hero."" With special deputies he will outnumber them. Amy asks him to choose between her whims and his experience and judgment. The judge decides to skip town. Deputy Harvey goes to see Marshal Kane, he wants the job and a recommendation.

We learn about the past relationships of Harvey, Kane, and Frank Miller! Mrs. Ramirez wants to sell her store quickly so she can leave on the noon train. Will the hotel be more prosperous when Frank Miller is back? Harvey is in the saloon. Ben Miller drops in for a bottle. Kane asks for help in the saloon, none volunteer. [Why?] Neither does a friend. Jimmy asks to join, he used to be good with a gun. Kane goes to the church to ask for all the special deputies he can get to help him. The church members argue over what must be done. Time is running short. Can a problem be solved by ""deferred maintenance""? ""They just don't care."" [Why?] Mark says he is too old. Mrs. Kane visits Mrs. Ramirez for help, but she is leaving too. Amy's personal experiences are explained. [A clue to the future?] ""A smart man knows when to back away."" Harvey talks to Kane. [Does this fight make sense? Note the bruises.] One man had volunteered, but Herb doesn't like the odds. The clock strikes noon. The steam train whistles its approach. Kane writes a holographic Last Will and Testament.

Marshal Kane walks into Main Street and watches the wagon leave for the train station. Frank Miller detrains and joins those three men. Breaking glass warns Kane. Shots are fired, not it is three against one. The hunting goes on, one man runs into the barn. Now it is two against one. The stable is set afire. Kane frees the horses and escapes. One man is shot from behind! [I won't tell who did it.] Only Frank Miller is left. Then Kane appears in the street. It is over at last. Will and Amy are reunited. Will tosses his tin star into the dust.

""The Making of High Noon"" follows. Monochrome is used to reduce costs, as in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", when an unconventional movie is produced. This story is based on ""The Tin Star"", a 1947 story in Collier's Magazine. Carl Foreman was an ""unfriendly witness"" before HUAC, a man who stood for what he believed in. The script was an excellent drama. The low budget excluded the usual padding. Western movies show the pioneers who overcame adversity; this provides hope for the common people.

The story takes place in virtually real time. This is a morality play where a good man triumphs over villains. It doesn't give the background from five years ago when Frank Miller was convicted of manslaughter. Was he involved in the running of that ""hotel"" and a gambling casino? Did Will Kane move in to take over? In the 19th century the local Committee of Vigilance would have eliminated robbers and murderers. A Town Marshal was elected by the voters, but the local power elite would have selected a man to do their bidding. A Marshal who best represented the people would have no problem in getting special deputies. This story goes against these historical facts. Having a woman with a firearm is also unconventional, but few dared to comment on this. This one-man army is similar to the later ""Rambo"" movies.",1412640000,,3810,4.572474377745242
