7845326,5,6303336264,"This is a great slapstick comedy, as the antics of Vicente and his hilarious buddies, Hector Suarez and Lalo ""El Mimo"" (and his trusty red truck ""El Pajarote""), will make you roar with laughter.
I didn't think anything could be funnier than the titles, but the mirth just keeps rolling on. The wake ! The scene where Hector and Lalo have been cross-dressed !...and so many more.
The music is terrific, and it also has some very moving scenes. The one with the priest is wonderful. It's all about forgiving, and how ""a man is measured by his capacity to forgive, because it's the hardest thing to do""...as the priest adds: ""Para perdonar, hay que tener los ****** bien puestos"". This film is insanely funny, sweet, wise, and very special.",973036800,,737,4.676923076923077
