8455031,4,B00536RXPG,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD. My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes, other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

Author W.R. Burnett was very influential in the early ""talkie"" era. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LITTLE-CAESAR/dp/B000TYURAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LITTLE CAESAR</a>&nbsp;(1929), considered the first Mob novel, was in 1930 also the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/film/dp/B0006HBLUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">film</a>&nbsp;that popularized the gangster genre. Burnett's follow-up book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IRON-MAN/dp/B0006AKTQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IRON MAN</a>&nbsp;(1930) was also adapted for the movies in 1931.

The film that stars handsome Lew Ayres glamorizes the character of Coke Mason, described by  Burnett thusly: ""His face was red and coarse; his stiff dark hair stood on end no matter how much he worked at it; and his brow was low and wide. He was too big in the shoulders; too small in the hips; and he had no neck to speak of. His eyebrows, each thick enough to make a mustache... overhung his eyes, and when he was fighting he peered up between them.""

Jean Harlow was effectively paired opposite gruff and homely Wallace Beery in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DINNER-AT-EIGHT/dp/B004SOUBD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DINNER AT EIGHT</a>&nbsp;(1933), so why not with a boxer of Mason's appearance? But he's nowhere to be found here. One thing's certain: her Rose Mason is a rat in heels.

Director Tod Browning does his usual competent job with this story of an athlete of some talent and great heart whose love of a woman not worth the time of day destroyed him in the novel. A vividly depicted KO closes the story. The film ends differently: ties that in the past made him successful but were severed for Rose's sake are reknotted by Mason. He's finally through with her and his future seems hopeful.

IRON MAN is an interesting example of pre-film noir storytelling and as such is recommended, especially for fans of early talkies.

According to imdb and dvd afficianado Universal has not released this movie yet, thus this is probably an unofficial copy not made from the original elements. Is this film weird, interesting and worth watching? Yes. Am I pretty sure this is a DVD-R copy you are getting and not from Universal either? Yes to that too.

Just don't pay Warner Archive prices and wind up with an Alpha Video quality copy.",1328918400,2,448,4.670886075949367
