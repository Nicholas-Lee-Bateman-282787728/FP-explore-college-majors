Thank you for making this DVD! My friend and I have been using your DVDs to learn Thai and we are doing very well & really enjoy your teaching approach. I'm a massage therapist and look forward to offering Thai to my clients. This is a very complete DVD. It is a learning DVD, which means, you should expect to pause it and rewind it many times over. Learning from a DVD  can be more difficult than learning in a classroom.  So you have to be patient and willing to keep practicing and keep a good attitude when you don't understand something. eventually it will make sense.  I have several thai dvds and this one is definitely the best.  If you can't learn Thai from this DVD, it's not the DVD :) This DVD has given me immediate knowledge making the DVD a great find! Thanks again!",1389484800,,899,4.295857988165681
8333653,4,B001PL8Z96,"Gabriel is a great instructor for Thai massage.  The video is maybe not best in technical expertise, but the essence of who he is as a teacher and a practitioner is so evident in this video.  He is an absolutely love person whose love for Thai is quite evident and shines through in this video.  The sequence is a bit quick...so it may take a few rewinds to fully see what he is doing.  Nonetheless, I really enjoy listening to him as he teaches and shows how to bless the receiver with the gift of Thai massage.

It's well worth the money in my opinion.",1389398400,,554,4.238095238095238
8333654,2,B001PL8Z96,This product was a waste of time and money for our clinic. The information was great for beginners and is a dissapoiintment.,1367712000,,124,4.681818181818182
8333655,3,B001PL8Z96,"I liked his technique, but I wish they took the time to make it look profesional.  Its a bunch of homemade clips put together.  Not worth the price.",1301529600,,148,4.25
8333656,2,B001PL8Z96,"This is an interesting video to watch, especially if you are new to the field of thai massage.  However, if you have some prior knowledge and are looking to learn more techniques/postures, this dvd will probably not help you.  This is not an educational resource.  It provides some exposure to the world of thai massage.  Overall, poor quality footage and disappointing.",1290470400,,370,5.016393442622951

""...Hi Gabriel, I've received your DVD today and I have to tell you that I didn't like it. It's far from being professional, your English is awful, the DVD quality is unacceptable.

I've ordered it, because it looked like I would LEARN SOME NEW techniques of Thai massage from this ""course"", but here is the only thing I've understood: it's better NOT to believe every charlatan who decides to sell his DVD on Amazon.

Maybe you should watch some really good video courses to understand what I mean. Try ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thai-Massage-Therapeutic-Thai-Fundamentals-with-Chuck-Duff/dp/B001BKMVTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thai Massage: Therapeutic Thai Fundamentals with Chuck Duff</a>"". About your DVD, only thing I can tell you: I'm sorry for my $20+$13 of taxes.

In your case, you decided to sell a DVD made of pieces of various exercises, presenting it like an INNOVATION in Thai massage. What I hate: when a person tries to fool me. About expectations you think I did have, you are right I did expect to get what you promised to provide, not that funny story about the work of Art. I mean if you describe yourself as an honest person, at least try to be one. If out of 3 people that have ordered your DVD, 2 found it to be that was awful and one was payed to tell that it's a good one, something must be wrong to be so proud of it.
