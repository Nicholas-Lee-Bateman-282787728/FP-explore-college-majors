8599937,5,B000EG46S2,"I watched the VCD two years ago and liked it a lot. The costumes, dances and music were beautiful, traditional and classic. This is the kind of show I would highly recommend to all Chinese and those who interested in Chinese culture. It is the first Chinese New Year show by NTDTV, and a very worthwhile collection. I also bought DVDs for 2005 and 2006 Chinese New Year Gala by NTDTV. Every year's program were completely different and all orginially created. You can find some highlights of this VCD from shows.ntdtv.com.",1170720000,,522,4.747252747252747
