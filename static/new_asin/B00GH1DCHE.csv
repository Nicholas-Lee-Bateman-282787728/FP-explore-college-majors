With that said, there are not many Korean martial arts films that pass muster. 'Arahan' is far and away my favorite Korean film and that's saying a lot. It blends well-written comedy, incredible action sequences, wonderful special effects, elements of Western fantasy and mysticism, and excellent direction. The closest comparison to it would be 'Kung Fu Hustle', but only because both are thematically similar and done very well, not because either is really like the other in tone or setting. I strongly recommend it for any action fan who wants an escape from reality and has no problems with foreign cinema and subtitles.",1424217600,2,794,4.802919708029197

I love this one just had to order it. It is sub titled, but no biggie. I actually learning some Korean and Chinese and been picking up on Japanese as well. This one explains about one's Chi and how to use it. This one person is out to save the world he just doesn't know it. It's funny and serious, Just love it!!!",1397174400,,463,4.0989010989010985
