8073580,4,B000A343QE,I love this product because it gives me what I need to know quickly and clips of good matches. They give an overview of the first week for both the men and the women and you really get deep into the one on one action in the second week. If your expecting to see full matches or games sorry this is an official film of the event not a match by match commentary. Which is why only 4 stars.,1198022400,,387,3.911392405063291
8073581,1,B000A343QE,"totally disappointed.  just a few clips, and they weren't even LONG clips.

I expected full games and left let down.

Wimbledon is GREAT, this DVD is not.  If you're a tennis fan or player... look elsewhere for footage",1196812800,3,218,4.657894736842105
8073582,1,B000A343QE,"Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and Greta Scacchi's boring voice-over doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.
Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.
Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55.
