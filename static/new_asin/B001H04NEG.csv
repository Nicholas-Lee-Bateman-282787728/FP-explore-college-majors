8307531,4,B001H04NEG,"Set in the 1920s the film reflects the uncertainties of those years in the Balkans.
The Ottoman Empire is coming to an end and a new nation is about to be created through the vision of a strong leader who will transform the old empire into modern Turkey.
The political and military conflicts in the area see people moving from one country to another, frontiers are changing, populations exchanged and the formation of new maps were common.
The events drew the attention of Journalists who wanted to write about it but also to capture the events on photos as the photojournalism is by now taking shape and influencing readers the world round.
Norman Harris is one of those journalists who, disappointed by the way his artistic work is received at home, is returning to the USA on a ship that also brings along all kind of people representing the society of those years.
The Balkans were characterized by conflict, poverty and nationalism and men from many countries were looking to the New World as an opportunity to start a better life and support those at home.
Once settled in the new world they were ready to start a family, but strong nationalistic and religious feelings were forcing them to look for girls from their home countries.
This is the way a new industry was born, bringing brides to the USA.
Girls desperate by poverty and the pressures from their own families to marry, were accepting to become brides to men they have never seen before, they knew nothing about them and the only link was an agent and a photo in their hands.
The film is depicting perfectly the spirit of those journeys.
In the first class are those who had money, a place in the world, they were trading and enriching themselves; they were celebrating and traveling in style.
In the third class were the hundreds of girls from all poor nations with a photo in their hands and a hope that the husband they will be having will be a good man.
They knew that perhaps they would never see their country and their family again.
The drama is played between the first class deck and the third class deck with Norman Harris and Niki a seamstress from a Greek island.
While Norman is a reluctant resident of the first class deck and taking 100s of photos of the brides, Niki is part of the third class deck and making dresses for the celebrating women of the first class.
A special love is developed between them and through this love we can feel the stories of all the other brides.
Perhaps this is a film that people living in the new world should see as they might find in it the origins of their own family.",1254787200,6,2586,4.527777777777778
