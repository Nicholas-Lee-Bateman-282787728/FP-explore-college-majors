I would probably recommend this item to someone who cannot get enough of Native American and western shows.",1393027200,,224,4.068181818181818

The film starts with Lt Burke and St Calven arriving in a stagecoach, looking for Linus Quincannon(TONY MARTIN). Dressed in all black Quini tries to escape them and enters Miss Mason's(PEGGIE CASTLE)room. However she screams and the two US Army officers enter her room and ask Quini to come with them as the Army wanted him. Colonel Harry comes in and tells Quini that new Henri lever action repeaters were missing, 800 of them, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, near Fort Smith. That was 'Red Clouds' country. The shipment was secret. The Colonel warns that what these repeaters would do in the hands of Cheyenne,Sioux and Arapajo. Quini new these Indians well and had sympathy for them. Colonel asks Quini to help, as these rifles could now be with 'Iron Wolf' of the Arapajo. Miss Mason wanted to go to Fort Smith to pay ransom for her brother, $2,000, for his release. Capt Bell was in command at Fort Smith. Quini suspects mess at that Fort and agrees to go with Miss Mason, as the Indians had no use for the money. Quini wanted to take 2 men with him, Lt Burke and St Calven, dressed as cowhands. Next morning, they are all off towards Fort Smith. Quini finds a Cheyenne buffalo arrow and senses a hunting party out. So they ride horses without saddles and cover their faces and arms with brown dye, pretending to be Indians. Soon, they are watched by the Indians.
This story of  WILL COOK is well photographed by JOSEPH F BIRAC and well directed by LESLEY SELANDER. There are twists and mysteries in the script to keep you very interested.

8454168,3,B0052SO01U,"I am not too sure how to start or write this review. It's a Western I first saw some 50 odd years ago in my local cinema here in the U/K. I'm pretty sure I've never seen it since, and for some reason it has always stuck with me. So, when I saw it by chance on the Amazon USA site I thought I would take a chance as it's an MGM (UA) ""Made to order"" and others have been terrific. It is expensive - $26.46 inc postage, but, my choice, take the risk. I needn't have worried. The quality is first class, widescreen, lovely De Luxe Colour (well you know it's not as good as Technicolour), and sound levels good. A nice box with good presentation. (I would appreciate a cast list on these DVDs but thats a minor quibble). As to the film - It's a Bel Air Prod (I love em) directed by Leslie Selander and starring Tony Martin as Quincannon,who is hired back by the army to find 8oo stolen Henry rifles (No one else on the entire frontier is capable obviously). He reluctantly sets off accompanied by John Bromfield and John Doucette, both good, and Peggie Castle, one of my favourite unsung heroines (or bad girls) of the movies (I loved her in ""Oklahoma Woman""). John Smith makes a brief appearence as a Lieutenatnt at the fort, and Ron Randell is the CO. There is a fair bit of action tho not in my opinion, up to Selander's usual standard. Not too much talk and Tony Martin is intruth, better than you might expect. This is not one of the better B+ westerns, but I did enjoy it, and I feel true western fans looking for a very rarely shown film should like it too, even tho it is expensive, so think carefully. I can only give it 3 stars as a film tho the DVD itself gets 5 for quality. (Perhaps sneak in a very quiet 4th star for the film, as it gave me an enjoyable 85 minutes!!!)",1329091200,8,1777,4.153623188405797
