8673491,4,B00MOXR7MA,"The Michael Bennett-Matt Taven match was solid to say the least. The Reby Sky, Shovelhead Chuck and The Manscout Jake Manning-Velvet Sky, Robbie The Giant Araujo and Mark Shurman-6 person tag team match was fun entertainment wise but so-so wrestling wise. The Sergei Volkov-Romeo Roselli match was merely okay to say the least. The Monster BC (fka Brodus Clay)-J Busta match was a one-sided flop. The Joe Ausanio-Dan De Man match was also fun entertainment wise but so-so wrestling wise. The  3 way Heavyweight title match (Brian Anthony vs. Caleb Konley vs. Matt Sydal (fka Evan Bourne) was a good high-tech & high-flying spot fest. The Piledriver match between Jerry Lawler & Kevin Steen was fun despite the TNA-style inference. The  Young Bucks-Hardy Boys-tag team match was a awesome, high-flying, hard-hitting spot-fest. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1428883200,,858,5.078014184397163
