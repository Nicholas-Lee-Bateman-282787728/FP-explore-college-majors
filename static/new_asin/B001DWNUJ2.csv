The film is set in Santiago de Chile, and, as anyone who has traveled through that area knows, Chileans are of European descent:  ergo, they look like Europeans.  No, Chileans don't look like people from Colombia or even Peru.  They look more like their neighbors in Argentina or Uruguay.

Anyway, the premise of the movie is a reality television show that goes awry with a killer amongst the cast.

Buy it, rent it, whatever, but watch it and I'm sure you will enjoy it.

Oh, by the by, Chileans speak Castillian~~~the only nation outside of Spain where Castillian is spoken.",1381363200,,665,4.681034482758621
