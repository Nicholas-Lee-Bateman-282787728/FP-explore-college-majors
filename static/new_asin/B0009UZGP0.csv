8573208,1,B0009UZGP0,"Calling this a DVD field guide is a vast overstatement.  If this were a book, it would be a series of pictures with no text other than a single common name of the bird.

This DVD isn't much more than a sequence of relatively low quality and short, 45 second long videos of different birds.  There is no voice over.  No introduction to bird watching.  No identification of species other than the name of the bird and occasionally whether it's male or female.  The dvd claims to show you unique and entertaining behaviors, preferred habitats, diagnostic field marks and sounds.  If you know what you're looking for, you can glean some of that information from the mostly quiet video interrupted by occasional bird calls, but it's otherwise left as an exercise for the viewer.",1477267200,,773,4.723880597014926
