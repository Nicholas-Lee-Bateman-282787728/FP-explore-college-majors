5676600,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"This is a great instructional DVD if you are interested in Fusion style belly dance and have some belly dancing under your belt (the warm-up uses dance moves). I rate it for Advanced Beginners-Intermediate.
The breakdowns of moves are excellent (both spoken and written) with plenty of drill time, and the combos echo what you see the big names doing on Youtube. I particularly like the way she drills the combos at different speeds.
This DVD has answered a lot of my questions about how to get that distinctive fusion look.
My one quibble is that it would have been nice to see a performance or two by Ms Beaman - I guess I'll just have to head back to Youtube. I'm proud to have contributed to the Kickstarter that led to this DVD.",1376092800,4,733,4.477611940298507
5676601,5,B00BUV9ZUO,Ms. Beaman broke the transitions down from top to bottom giving drills and starting at a very slow pace to a full on combination. I rememered everything after the very first session watching the video because she made sure that we were comfortable with each combo until moving on. This video is perfect for begginers to more advanced to absolute professionals. I hope that in the future Ms. Beaman continues to make more videos. I have taken her classes and workshops and she is nothing short of amazing! Her video portrayed how amazing she is at teaching and dancing as well. Not only did I learn amazing combinations It was a wonderful workout and I felt great after. There is not enought I can say to portray how absolutely amazing she is. I would urge anyone to buy this video!!!!!,1367452800,9,785,4.614285714285714
5676602,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"Sara Beaman's ""Fluid Transitions"" is a wonderful instructional DVD for the intermediate to advanced belly dancer (note:  this DVD is not intended for use by beginner belly dancers).  Sara breaks the moves down clearly, and shows them from various angles for easy understanding.  During the practice segments, she demonstrates the moves and combinations in both directions at three different paces. The moves and combinations in the DVD are beautiful and well-explained.  There are also several condensed practices to choose from on the menu if you don't have time to do the whole DVD, or if you just want to focus in on a particular move or combination.
The format of the DVD menus and chapters is simple and easy to understand, and free of distractions.  As a belly dance instructor myself, I will definitely be recommending this DVD to my students.  This is a wonderful instructional and practice tool for tribal fusion belly dancer.",1364860800,5,935,5.038961038961039
5676603,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"This is more a review of my partner, because I got the DVD for her, but she hasn't stopped talking about.  Apparently this is the quintessential modern-day bellydance oracle.  As far as I can tell, it seems fine, although I haven't watched it 2 dozen times like she has.  So, for what its worth, I thought that my partner's fondness(obsession) of this DVD is noteworthy, plus I feel like a champ because I found it.  Bonus: wife's moves ""totally transformed""",1364774400,9,458,4.6875
5676604,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"I highly recommend this DVD for any intermediate/advanced fusion bellydancer wanting to learn new combos or just looking to practice smoothing out their dance moves. After a warm-up and some isolation drills, the DVD takes you through 6 different combos then a cool down. Combos 1-4 are drilled separately at first then combined for additional practice. Combos 5 and 6 each have a simplified and a more complex version of themselves so you can practice at whichever level you are comfortable.

She explains each drill step-by-step while showing what it looks like from different angles, making it easy to follow along and understand. You practice each combo multiple times (each direction), gradually speeding it up each time, making ample practice time for each combo. There is also an option to choose between 4 different condensed practices so that if you don't have time to do the whole DVD you can split it up. You can also easily pick any one of the different isolation drills or combos straight from the menu without having to fast forward or look for it if you want to go back and focus on one of them, which I really liked.

I would definitely recommend this DVD for practice for any fusion dancer!",1364774400,14,1207,4.798076923076923
8574234,4,B00BUV9ZUO,I actually watched the bloopers for this dvd on youtube along with her most recent work.  Her most recent youtube videos are why I decided to purchase this dvd.  It's the only one that I'm aware she has. I was a bit surprised at how quickly and fluidly she moved after seeing blooper video.  She gives some instruction but doesn't go into detail with movement. I'm already familiar with most of it so I didn't have any trouble following her.,1482796800,,441,4.4875
8574235,5,B00BUV9ZUO,I love this DVD! I had it for a year but only have gotten  to it. What a delightful surprise. Sara breaks everything down into easy to work chunks at various speeds. The combinations can be easily made into a short choreo or incorporated into a longer one.. Many thanks! A wonderful discovery.,1461974400,,293,4.528301886792453

8574240,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"Starts with an actual bellydance warmup.  You then move quickly through technique which is great for review at home.  Then you get a good run through of the drills.  Combinations are next and they are not what you see all the time.  Nothing in this dvd is so long to get boring or so short to be useless.  If you are a beginner, expect to play a section a couple times to get the muscle memory but you will get it.  Higher levels will love the brevity of the sections.",1385251200,,468,4.144444444444445
8574241,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"If you've been dancing for a while you know: the right teacher is not necessarily the one who's the most famous, the most experienced, or even, frankly, the best dancer. Often, it's the person who can communicate to you in a way that makes sense to your brain and ultimately your body. This is important in live instruction, but essential when it comes to DVDs, where you can't ask the teacher any questions, and she can't respond to the way you learn.

This is why I get excited -- really excited -- when I see instructional DVDs that are crafted to work for different kinds of learners, that are more than just, ""You do this, then you do this."" One of the exciting things about being a consumer of bellydance videos over the past decade has been seeing how creative producers get, with practice flows, the smart chaptering, innovative material and drills, you name it.

So, guess what? I was excited to work with my review copy of Sara Beaman's Fluid Transitions: Drills and Combinations for Fusion Bellydance. From the first moment I thought, ""Oh, she's thought about this. She's thought about how to make this usable and easy to learn from."" And my first impression was not wrong.

The focus of Fluid Transitions is pretty clear from the title, but it's probably worth mentioning that Beaman does not give any theory or tips on transitions separately from the drills. The idea behind the program is to achieve fluidity by doing careful drills of combinations at multiple speeds. The DVD is aimed towards intermediate or advanced dancers -- definitely not beginners! -- and if you are one of these dancers chances are that you can take the tools Beaman gives you and apply them to whatever combinations you're working on.

The most straightfoward way to work with the DVD is to play all the sections through, which is what I did. This way, you get a:

Warm Up of approximately 10 min. This is based on dynamic stretches and some shimmying, it starts up the muscles and joints you need to move, but it doesn't get you really warm. I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to do a little something extra to get the heart rate up too.

Isolation Drills, about 16 min. You can play this section right through, or choose single drills from a menu. Here, Beaman quickly but precisely covers the movements she'll be using in the later combos. The drilling is brief -- this is not mean to teach beginners how to do the moves, but to remind you of the correct executions of moves you already know. That said, Beaman also gives little tips on form.

Here's one of the neat things about the DVD: each move is preceded by a screen that shows a written breakdown of the move. Being someone who learns best by reading, I loved this decision. It lets me internalise the idea visually, before I hear the oral breakdown and see how it's done.

This is followed by a brief, about 6 min, Isolation Practice Flow. You basically do the isolations, but all together. I think this part is great, as it gets you into the feeling of moving and putting isolations together.

Now we get into the meat. The first combination section contains combos 1 through 4 (about 30 min). Each combination has that great screen before it, quickly explaining what will come up. Then Beaman breaks it down veeeery slowly. As far as I could tell, for every single combo in the program, Beaman is equally thorough in breaking down and drilling both sides. It's not only great to have both sides worked out equally, but I found that sometimes I will ""get"" a movement on one side faster than the other, so I'm glad to have both sides instructed too.

The combos themselves are quite short and focused on linking together moves using the torso, hips, abs, and arms. There are no traveling steps. These are small units you then drill like crazy to get your body moving smoothly from one kind of isolation to another. In some cases, Beaman will present an easier version and a tougher version of a combo -- and then she has you drill both.

Just in case that wasn't enough, she then has you drill the combos at three different speeds.  Often, she will have you drill something at half time and at full time for each of the three speeds, which means you're actually drilling at six different speeds! All of the speeds and instructions segments are chaptered, so you can easily repeat, and they're in the menus, so you can go directly where you like.

Needless to say, what this does to your body feels pretty wonderful. As much as it's challenging for the brain to follow along, it's such a fabulous, careful, thorough way of getting moves into your body. Even on the first play of the DVD, I was starting to ""get"" some of the combinations quite smoothly. I stopped and went to a mirror to practice sometimes, I did my own stretches in between the sections, but it all worked. It felt good. And I think doing the three speeds is brilliant, because while my first challenge was getting a combo down, my second was doing it slowly. Doing a combination slowly but still evenly and smoothly is harder than doing it fast, and a great way to pay attention to what the muscles are doing and to each component of the movement.

Then things get even more interesting. Beaman takes apart combos 1 and 2, and puts them together into one longer combo. Same for 3 and 4. And you drill those. Here's what I loved about this. While she doesn't say it in so many words, she's really teaching you how to get smooth transitions in your own movement. You break it down into the smallest possible combinations, drill those like crazy, then combine them in creative ways, and drill those together.

The next section features combos 5 and 6 (about 17 min), and these work a little differently. These are layering combinations, and what Beaman eventually has you do is to do one of the layers, then all of the layers together, then another of the layers alone, then all together, and so on. What part of my brain was still working at this point was fried by these drills, but I also found them really cool. It's basically a pattern for creating movement that's interesting to the eye, adding and subtracting layers in turn.

Finally, you have a satisfying Cool Down that stretches everything out from a standing position. It's about 6 minutes long, so I added some of my own stretches too.

The menus are really smart, really detailed. I love this, I love it when a producer really thinks about how to make the work usable. Moreover, in a separate section Beaman has four practices set up ranging from 23 to 32 minutes, each of which begins with the warm up, takes you through some of the combos, and ends with the cool down.

Fluid Transitions really, really, badly made me want to do more tribal fusion. But I don't think you have to be a tribal dancer to get a lot out of it. This morning I was already thinking about how some of the combos could be modified -- with something as simple as a heel up, for example -- to give them a more raks sharki feeling. One thing I can't judge however is how much of the material or method would be new to dancers already steeped in TF. Who wouldn't like it? Well, if you're a beginner, you might find it moves too fast for you. Also, if you're looking for transitions between traveling moves, you'll find nothing here.

That said, there's a lot to grow with Fluid Transitions. She gives some tips at the beginning for how to modify or add to the drills. But the real point is, this DVD doesn't just teach you to string together a few moves, it teaches you how to think about putting moves together and then drilling them. You learn to take out an element from an isolation to make it work with another move, you learn to take combinations apart and put them together in creative ways, and you learn how to play with layers to make cool-looking dance. What's not to love about that?

8574242,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"Awesome video.  I wish Sara had a performance piece at the end of her video.  She's a very good instructor, breaks down the muscles used and how to transisition from one move to another.  I love that she encourages the dancer to experiment with combo's and come up with your own.  Thanks, Sara.  When will you're next video be out?",1380758400,,331,4.45
8574243,5,B00BUV9ZUO,"Sara Beaman is a great instructor, and the different camera angles really help you understand what parts of the body should be moving and which muscles.

Even for intermediate dancers these drills are GREAT and will have you sweating :)

Recommended for all dancers, all bellydance styles.  Something beautiful and different, and unlike anything else out there right now. BUY IT!!!",1380240000,,381,5.213114754098361
