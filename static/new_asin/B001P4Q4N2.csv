8332105,5,B001P4Q4N2,"Easier to stock up on food and drink for a dinner party. Harder to convince people to die for your party.
Once the great unwashed start killing each other over ideological scraps, and crusts of bread, the imperialists will party all night long.",1440633600,,244,4.6976744186046515
8332106,4,B001P4Q4N2,"If you have more than a passing acquaintence with the city of San Francisco, you'll appreciate the ambiance of this film.  The ""terrorist plot"" is a bit far-fetched, but the ennui of the talented young in The City is not.  The biggest plus is that American punk godfather, Austin, Texas's own Gary Floyd (The Dicks, Sister Double Happiness, The Gary Floyd Band, Black Kali Ma, Buddha Brothers, Bad Ride)--himself a Bay area musical legend--does an amazing turn as a street preacher.  Well worth the price of admission.",1261612800,4,518,4.931034482758621
