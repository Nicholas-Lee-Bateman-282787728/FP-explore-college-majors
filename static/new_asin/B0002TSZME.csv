2119920,5,B0002TSZME,"Looks good for a DVD. I first watched BGC in the late 90's and I'm still a big fan. The extras are light, but with an older series that's to be expected. As far as the video quality goes; It's as good as you're going to get for a DVD of an 1980's series. There are minor annoyances with the quality, but it's really due to the age of the series more than any flaw on the part of the DVD.

I'm just excited to have a piece of my youth available to watch on a whim.",1462752000,,463,3.7731958762886597

2119927,5,B0002TSZME,"Bubblegum Crisis was an anime series I fell in love with when I was still a teenager. Back in the 1980's this wonderful and engaging Japanese anime series was hugely entertaining and inspiring. Today, in the age of supercomputers and cutting edge special effects, this terrific cyberpunk creation by Sonoda Kenichi and his masterful team of animators can still stand on its own. The storyline is simple and at times thought provoking. The four armored, high tech Knight Sabers fighting an evil global corporation, what more can you ask for? :) More than just an anime, these series make you think about action and responsibility for action. The explore the depths of love, hate, depravity and compassion in a world where technology far outpaces morality. Excellent animation, interesting characters and terrific soundtrack with beautiful songs make these series a true collector's item. If you've never seen these anime, buy it and watch it. You won't be disappointed! :) Knight Sabers, it's show time!",1433635200,,1002,5.153374233128834

2119945,5,B0002TSZME,"In my personal opinion this is the best anime ever! The music featured in the series is amazing and the English versions of the songs are equally perfect. If I rember corectly this wonderful series was created as an OVA in the late 1980's. Never concluded Bubblegum Crisis Crash was created in the early 1990's to conclude the series.

This work of art, im my opinion, is the story of the Knightsabers - without going into detail they are a group of women with extreamly powerfull hardsuits (advanced battle suits) that they use to combat boomers.

I am a huge fan of Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040, released in the 2000's, however I believe I like the originol Bubblegum Crisis the best.

I believe that any fan of Classic Anime and Science Fiction anime will enoy this series.",1297900800,,776,4.649635036496351
2119946,4,B0002TSZME,"Let me just say, I've been dying to get my hands on this series without breaking my wallet. I'm happy to say that everything went quite smoothly with my expectations. I'm a huge fan of 80's style anime, like Dirty Pair and Robotech. It just has that look that anime now a days just can't replicate. First of all, most if not all of the series was made by hand and not computer help. It just shows a lot of blood and effort on that part alone. They also took great care in making each episode on movie standards, all quite polished thanks to the remastering. I would highly recommend putting the settings of audio to Japanese and subtitled, since the english is a bit crappy, America back then was just getting into anime and unfortunately not every voice actor was good at expressing emotions or tone for that matter. Other then that, this series is an absolute gem.",1288396800,,866,4.452830188679245
2119947,4,B0002TSZME,"I hadn't seen this series since it was originally released on VHS back in the early 1990s, but when I saw the DVD box set on special a few weeks ago I felt nostalgic enough to pick it up.

BGC is about a group of four power-armored mercenary women challenging an evil corporation in the Tokyo of two decades in our future. At the time of its original release, it was cutting edge anime that evolved into something pushing the limits of what could be done without the help of computers. Though its early episodes are rough by modern standards, as each one passes it gets better until the final four stand up quite well.

The story told has an unfinished quality that seems to wander at points, but this is because the series was part of the direct to video [OVA] movement and no one on the production team knew how many episodes they had to tell their story. The first three are self-contained and tell a story arc that sets the tone of the characters and introduces the world. After that, however, various directors take their turn at telling stories inside that world, taking it in slightly different directions.

They were really on to something in the unity being created by their diverse stories and it is a shame that this original group of creators were not allowed to go beyond the eight episodes in this package. The character, and particularly the mecha and power suit, designs are very well done. The stories effectively draw you into the character interactions, making it more than a mere high tech smash up. And the music was ground breaking for anime, as the show was specifically produced to be an animated rock show over top the action. A huge number of songs were written for it, many of them with vocals, and most of the latter are well worth a listen; good j-rock and j-pop tunes for the time.

In fact, the music was so popular that three separate music video collections were released parallel to the program. All of them are included in this box set, comprising nearly twenty performances. Most of the ones from the first two are animated sections from the series; however, one has some original animation made specifically for it that shows how Sylia rounded up the other ladies. There are also a few showing the original voice actors singing songs. Look up Bubblegum Crisis ""Rock Me"" on You Tube and it will give you a pretty good idea about what things are like.

If you are a BGC fan you have likely seen all of this before, as it was released in North America, but you have probably not seen the third one: Holiday in Bali. I remember friends of mine in the early Nineties, who were BGC fanatics, trying to do anything and willing to pay any price to get a laser disc copy of this, as it was not part of the original releases over here. None of them ever got one and, now having seen it, I don't think that they missed much. It is an amateur quality puff piece following the voice actors around Bali. They call each other by their character names and each has a little adventure where they sing a song from the series. The one who comes across well is Akiko Hiramatsu, Nene's actor, who also provides the most entertaining moments when she goes para-sailing and when an entire barbecue pig is plunked down in front of her.

The other extras are fairly standard. These are the obligatory artwork, background information, and interviews. However, the latter are merely text on the screen and most of it is not particularly enlightening unless you are new to the program and its history.

At this point, BGC is a classic anime that changed how people viewed the medium and influenced the direction of many programs that came after it. A feast of advanced technology with a Blade Runner sensibility, you should enjoy this series quite a bit, as long as you are willing to view it in the context of the place and time of its creation.",1280534400,11,3855,4.522238163558106
2119948,4,B0002TSZME,"Bubblegum Crisis: 7 out of 10: Hot chicks, giant robots, and evil corporations fill every frame of Bubblegum Crisis as does some surprisingly catchy Eighties tunes.

Bubblegum Crisis, like Akira or Macross, is one of those Anime that separate the thirty something Anime fan from this year's crop of snot nosed punk kids. When you think Japanese cartoons, do you think Pokmon or shower scenes. Do you think irritating children or kick ass adults. Do your favorite plots involve the little kids defeating the big evil corporation or adults facing economic hardship and self-sacrifice. Bubblegum crisis is an Anime for the thirty something.

As I settle into my damn kid's today voice and distaste for every exaggerated, rapid cut seizure inducing, saccharine piece of crap that passes for entertainment these days. (I am looking your way Cartoon Network). I can sit back and watch full-grown woman destroy some boomers (as well as half of Tokyo) and reminisce about my childhood when cartoon characters swore and a gratuitous nude scene followed every battle.

Is Bubblegum Crisis as good as I remember it? No. The episodes do not flow into each other well and vary in quality. Some of the dubbing is dubious and the live action music videos contained in the extras are simply painful (In a OMG what cheese kind of way).

Bubblegum Crisis allows me to both relieve my childhood and look down upon kids today. What more could I ask for my entertainment dollar.",1248825600,24,1457,4.9105691056910565

2119950,5,B0002TSZME,The Bubblegum Crisis anime is a classic OVA series and needs to be a part of any fan of either cyberpunk or Japanese animation.  Despite the animation for the first three episodes dating from the late 1980s the storylines remain interesting and eminently watchable.  A great anime series for your friends to watch if they are over 16 and have never watched anime before or think it is just what is found on Cartoon Network.,1179014400,2,423,4.626666666666667
2119951,4,B0002TSZME,"In a ""Blade Runner"" like future, four vigilante women - the Knight Sabers - assist the AD Police in fighting boomers, living machines not unlike the Replicants from ""Blade Runner"". The Knight Saber ring leader is Sylia Stingray, a rich, mysterious brunette who is the daughter of the man who created the boomers and whom might actually be a boomer herself. The others include rebellious biker girl Priss Asagiri, aerobics instructor Linna Yamazki and ADP computer hacker Nene. Other characters include ADP man Leon McNichol, a Brad Pitt like pretty boy with high ideals and a jerky attitude as well as a thing for Priss and with Leon is his hilarious partner Daley Wong. Oh and Sylia has a pervert whiz kid for a brother by name of Mackey. The villains include Quincy, chairman of GENOM, the company that produces the boomers, his right hand man Brian J. Mason (killed off too soon) and an obnoxious boomer man named Largo.

A good series overall, but being dated is the least of its problems. Originally slated for 13 episodes, it was cut short at episode 8, leaving many series plot threads unresolved. A sequel series, Bubblegum Crash, was concocted to solve this problem but it didn't help. Also the characters are never as well developed as you would like them to be. The most interesting character, the Knight Saber ringleader Sylia, is never completely explored. Linna had potential, but her subplot involving a friend who was apart of a mafia family was never resolved and most of the time Linna was just ignored. Nene was cute and funny but only had one episode to call her own, the last one. Sadly, most of the series attention was centered on Priss, who somehow became the most popular character of the series, so much in fact that although she was originally suppose to die, a fan backlash saved her; I think this was due partly to the fact that she was voiced by a then popular Japanese singer. But Priss herself was not that interesting of a character: all her episodes basically revolve around her seeking revenge for a minor character friend that we the audience sometimes didn't even get to know in depth. Priss became repetitive and dull after a certain point. I could never quite figure out what Leon saw in her.

But the series itself is not inherently bad. Animation is still pretty good in most of the eps (excluding the first one, which is a bit herky jerky, and the last one, in which the characters are drawn much too thinly), was generally good natured, good humored, and it had an interesting theme on humanity VS technology.

Remade for TV as ""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"" in 1999. Hate to say it, but 2040 was superior in many ways, though not completely perfect in and of itself.",1156636800,5,2709,4.6750524109014675
2119952,5,B0002TSZME,"The Bubblegum Crisis franchise in one of the strongest anime franchises out, with numerous spin-offs and a release of a new Bubblegum Crisis series, and there's no wondering why in my book. The characters, for there time, were original, the story was well-done and plotted excellently, the world in which the series was based was thoroughly thought out, and the music, though dated, works well with the anime.

In 2032-33, we get to meet the original four girls: Sylvia, Lena, Nene, and the ever popular Priss, as they battle Genom made Boomers from episode to episode in order to protect MegaTokyo. The first three episodes deals with the Knight Sabers battle with Brian Mason, the evil leader of Genom bent on destroying these four girls at all costs. The next episode gets away from the Genom story as the girls must fight a car infected with the Boomer virus, which is determined to destroy the Outriders, a biker gang. When Priss becomes a target, the Knight Sabers are forced to act. The fifth and six episodes gets back to the battle with Genom, and the Knight Sabers find themselves fighting some powerful new enemies: themselves, and the mysterious Largo. This is essentially the end of the series, yet two more movies follow that are almost entirely unrelated to the first six. In Double Vision, they must figure out a series of terrorist attacks against Boomer engineers. These attacks somehow involve Vision, an American singer. In Scoop Chase (my personal favorite) we follow Nene in her job as an AD Police officer while she watches over Lisa, a young girl who seems to idolize the Knight Sabers. That's when a new group of Boomers attack the AD Police headquarters and the Knight Sabers must act in order to save allies and friends from the ongoing Boomer threat.

What's great about this series is that it's actually a huge collection of short films. None of these episodes are less than a half-hour, and some are near to an hour or more. It makes it much more watchable, in the end, since there is never a ""to be continued."" You see one conflict resolve itself before moving onto the next, without ever truly escaping the core storyline.

This is a classic anime series that should be picked up by any person who truly wants to call themselves a hardcore fan. This is one of the founders of the cyberpunk genre and without this series, great anime like Akira may have never been. I recommend this to everyone.",1137542400,29,2426,4.716981132075472
2119953,5,B0002TSZME,"First, my review, then some corrections.

Short version, this is an exceptionally good (groundbreaking at the time) original series, paying homage to Blade Runner and cyberpunk as well as demonstrating the influence that a great soundtrack can have.  Presented against more recent anime, it shows its age, but I still rate it a buy.

Corrections to other reviews: First off, Bubblegum Crisis was the first series to appear.  Bubblegum Crash is a sequel attempted by a different production team, and it shows.  There are jarring differences in some characters and the Crash plotline is confusing and weird.  The AD Police series is also a spinoff, taking place before BGC and it has nothing to do with the Knight Sabers; it's quite dark and more adult in nature.  The relationship to the original BGC and the 2040 is tenuous at best, limited mainly to character names and plot basics.  2040 is hardly a remake.

The series was originally slated to run to 12 episodes, and some plot elements were affected by popular responses to the series, but it was cancelled at eight episodes due (I believe) to cost of production, so yes, some plot elements were left unfinished.  It's disappointing, but I think it's better in some ways than an unsatisfactorily rushed or poorly wrapped up ending.  Nonetheless, the series stands as my favorite anime of all time and is highly recommended.",1134518400,63,1377,4.917748917748917

2119959,4,B0002TSZME,"Synopsis:
The year is 2033, and Mega-Tokyo is just beginning to finish recovering from a HUGE earthquake that completely rearranged the face of Tokyo. Part of the recovery is due to the recent advancement of Boomer technology. Boomers (or Bumas, if you're watching the subbed version) are androids that look, think, and act just like human beings. They can be put to work, perform in the military, or, um, go berserk and terrorize the population.

The corporation responsible for all the major Boomer advancements is a monolithic company called GENOM, whose power seems to grow with every passing moment. GENOM seems to have a rather underhanded secret agenda (to take over the world, of course). With the world dependant on Boomer technology, there doesn't seem to be much that can resist its power.

Enter the Knight Sabers. This mercenary team of four young women equipped with hardsuits has the firepower and the courage to stand up to rampaging Boomers and the company behind them. Knight Sabers, sanjo!

My Review:
Being the sequel to Bubblegum Crash (which I haven't seen), this has an eqaul rating to Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040. This was a popular series in 1987 (according to my brother). Handling great elements in anime, you've got your ""cool"" mecha, big ugly androids to slay, and cute females in hardsuits. Pretty good package. And a plot? What there's no need for a plot!

In a few episodes, there are threads still hanging especially at the end of the series. Those that seek a good amount grain in anime, will respect this series for exisisting. For mild understanding, extrapolation is needed at times, which can become a bit tiresome.

As for the characters, I'd be more happy if more details were given. Details as to how the four women met each other and became Knight Sabers.

Animation is pretty good, especially in the for an action series. The android, robot scenes are pretty well drawn.

If you like J-Pop, you'll love the soundtrack and themes to this series. One warning, though: the dubbed version of Crisis is not quite up to par. Voices are usually quite mismatched, and the voice acting falls flat precisely in the scenes where convincing acting is most important for credibility.

The feel is heavily reminiscent of Blade Runner, and the creators of Crisis cleverly intersperse references to Blade Runner throughout the series (one of the less subtle references is how Priss's rock band is named The Replicants). It's not all gritty, though, and the occasional humorous touch adds a nice light feel to the series.

Overall, not a bad watch. In fact, at times, Bubblegum Crisis can be really good. Unfortunately, oversights and carelessness here and there keep this series from being all it can be. Though I give this series, Crisis the same as the next sequel, Tokyo 2040 fairly the same 4 stars/ out of 5. I favor Tokyo 2040 a bit more. I will note that you can watch these series w/ out refrences. You don't need to watch the prequels.",1102809600,6,2971,4.832677165354331
8031793,5,B0002TSZME,"It is just over 30 years since this OVA series began, and it has stood up remarkably well, despite multiple authors, lawsuits between participants, truncated series, reboots, and no definitive ending.  That such a thing is even watchable today is amazing, that most (but not all) of it has appealed to so many different viewers over so many long years is a tribute to the genius (mostly) displayed in creating it.  You won't like all of it, for too many different directions were tried, but you will likely like most of it, and of how many things is that true?

Lets begin with Bubblegum Crisis (1987-1991), a probably intended 13 half-hour-to-hour-long episode series, cut short to just 8.  In 2032 just seven years after Tokyo was hammered by the Second Great Kanto Earthquake, a colossal corporation, Genom, is rising, unchecked by the government entities it corrupts or owns.  Its products are artificial cybernetic lifeforms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machines.  These wondrous inventions do great good for mankind,... when they are working properly.  When they are not working properly, by accident or design, they become a menace to life, and are subject to destruction by the largely overworked and outmatched AD Police and the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of powered exoskeleton equipped mercenaries.  Interestingly, the ultimate goal of the Knight Sabers is not to destroy Genom, against whom most members have a blood debt or two, but rather to control it by destroying only its most destructive projects, products,... and people.

The first three episodes form a loosely contrived trilogy introducing the Knight Sabers, explaining their origin, depicting their struggles, and showing their ultimate triumph over the schemes of Genom executive Brian J. Mason.  This is followed by a single episode savage road duel between an automobile driver and a motorcycle gang, then by a two-episode heartbreaker about love-dolls, apparent vampirism, and Genom corruption.  The last two episodes involve a character with a vendetta (based upon the events of an earlier episode), and a final episode focussing on Nene.

Unfortunately, now the two rights holding companies began to angrily split apart, forcing all sorts of problems.  A truncated 3 OVA episode version of the arguably intended ending of the Bubblegum Crisis series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crash/dp/B00008G6U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crash</a>&nbsp;(1991), was produced, but it pales somewhat in comparison with the preceding (being a bit too silly), though it is necessary to watch for fans of the original.  An additional truncated 3 OVA prequel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AD-Police-Files/dp/B0002J4X3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AD Police Files</a>&nbsp;(1990), depicting the origin and earlier adventures of character Leon McNichol, was also produced, but it is overly downbeat and depressing, not to mention inconclusive about the fates of characters other than Leon, especially his first partner.

Next are the reboots, and as near as I can tell, no serious attempt was made to link any of these together.  The first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis-Tokyo-2040/dp/B00TQGGG8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040</a>&nbsp;(1998-1999), a 24 episode TV series plus 2 OVA episodes reboot of Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.  Now, as a rule, I don't think much of reboots for obvious reasons: Wow, the original was brilliant, unique, nothing quite like it!  How can we achieve similar success?  I know, lets COPY it!...  (What can possibly go wrong with that, the world wonders?)  More seriously, the problem with doing this (which I don't recommend by the way; instead Id advise adding sequels to the original story) is how do you do it successfully?  Steer too close to the original, and (unless your animation really is better, which it usually isnt, especially if you are going from OVA to TV) all youve got is a copy.  Whoopee.  Steer too far away, and you risk destroying whatever appeal the original had for its audience.  For this reason IMHO most reboots aren't worth your time, but there are exceptions, and one Im thinking of involves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Double-Trouble/dp/B00015HUUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Double Trouble</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Final-Force/dp/B0001KNHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Final Force</a>&nbsp;the 4 episode OVA series and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Decode/dp/B00BLQRFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty: Decode</a>&nbsp;the 25 episode TV series, plus 1 OVA.  At first glance, with the OVA series animated by Madhouse and the TV series NOT animated by Madhouse, it should have been no contest, but the TV series succeeds by being better written.  For one thing the main male character is less of a whiny wuss and more of a thoughtful contrast to Birdys insane recklessness.  In addition a lot more thought was put into the complications of Birdys life and universe, including the whole hilarious Birdy_pretends_to_be_a_model/idol running joke.

Similar things are going on in Bubblegum Crisis, Bubblegum Crash versus Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040.  The biggest problem with the original IMHO is that except for the 3 episode opening and the 3 episode Bubblegum Crash closing, there is no particular structure to the 5 episodes in the middle, and most of the several different creators seem to have focused on Priss, excepting the 8th episode focusing on Nene.  In contrast Sylia is largely a mystery, and Linna is largely a nonentity.  However, in Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 all four of the main characters are more carefully plotted out and, in particular, are a lot more in conflict with each other, both over Sylias secrets from them... and problems with each other.  A number of things brought over from the original series are more carefully planned, explained, and implemented in the reboot; in particular Mackey Stingray has been significantly changed.  Finally, the multi-episode stories have no original series equivalent.  About the only criticism Id make of the reboot is that in contrast to the careful plotting of the beginning and the build up to the end, the final events of the ending seem a bit confused and rushed; however, it is noteworthy that it does make considerably more sense in the Japanese with English subtitles format.

Next, although arguably a prequel, is the 12 episode TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-To-Protect-and-Serve/dp/B00005YUN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve</a>&nbsp;(1999); essentially its a cop show about the adventures of a couple of mismatched partners,... REALLY mismatched partners, who just happen to serve in the A.D. Police.  On the one hand it is pretty well written, and, unlike AD Police Files, this series actually has an ending; on the other hand, it is rather poorly animated and has a fairly downbeat and depressing ending, which goes with the downbeat and depressing halfway point.  Now, if you like cop stories, you will probably like this; there is definitely some clever writing about the problems of being a cop at any time, in any situation.  However, the science fiction seems a bit underwritten.

Last is the 3 OVA episode series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parasite-Dolls/dp/B0083QJVJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parasite Dolls</a>&nbsp;(2003), which is arguably another reboot since its connections with A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve (or AD Police Files for that matter) are iffy at best.  Yet Another Serious Look at the Underbelly of Tokyo/Genom City starts out pretty well, if pretty dark and grim, but the individual episode endings don't make much sense, and the final episode is so off the charts insane that it really messes up the series IMHO.

Note: Naked female breasts pop up infrequently but occasionally in many of these shows (in the OVAs) so be ye warned.

8031797,4,B0002TSZME,"Bubblegum Crisis was the very first DVD I ever purchased, more than 15 years ago,  before I even had a DVD player.  Why?  The music soundtrack.  The original Japanese songs were great and I bought the CD vocal soundtracks for the show, as well.  However, I also liked some of the English dubbed songs.  Particularly, the dubbed versions of ""Say Yes"", ""Never the End"", "" Chase the Dream"", ""Twilight"", and "" Held in My Heart"".  I even tried writing to AnimEigo years ago asking them if the English dubbed songs would ever get a CD release.  They said no.  They had originally planned to release one.  Which is why ""Genom Records"" is listed in the end credits for the English dubbed songs.  However, they decided against it for various reasons.  Which included, only parts of some songs had been recorded, not full songs.

So, buying the DVD of this great series, was a no brainer.  It didn't matter to me, that I didn't have a DVD player at the time.",1499385600,,948,4.5

8031802,5,B0002TSZME,"In the 1980s, anime was still individual paintings on mylar sheets, and the quality varied depending on whether the show was destined for TV, film, or direct-to-video release (called OVA or OAV, original video anime;  in this case, direct-to-video shouldn't be confused with the American studios' habit of simply dumping productions even *they* think won't sell on the market). BGC is the story of a vigilante team of younger women working to keep a lid on artificial life-forms running rampant in Tokyo. They're a mercenary team--much of what they do is on a for-hire basis--in many ways the series is a reimagining of many of the basic elements of Sir Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Much fun, very well written, the music--both the score and inevitable songs (two characters are professional singers: one, the up-and-comer trying to make it big, while moonlighting as a power-armored vigilante; the other a successful pop singer with a terrible secret and a thirst for revenge)--are memorable.

This is bedrock, classic AnimeEigo: tip-top production values, solid translation of the dialogue on screen, with brief explanations of the  puns and in-jokes in the script as well. The remastering has made the imagery cleaner and sharper, and the sound is gorgeous. Worth your time and cash!",1464134400,6,1286,5.173076923076923
