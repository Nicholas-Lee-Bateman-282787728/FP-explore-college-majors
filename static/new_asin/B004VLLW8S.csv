4482815,5,B004VLLW8S,"Camaleones (Chameleons - 789 minutes) This one is extremely well directed.

We start with a heist during a gala that celebrates a jewelery launch, by TWO people, each of whom is unaware of the other. Turns out both are being blackmailed into doing jobs for ""The Master,"" a crook named Chameleon. They must go under cover and pose as employees at a private military academy. They are housed together because they pretend to be siblings (last name Jaramillo) but an attraction begins to grow.

The man who plays Sebastian (Alfonso Herrera) is particularly appealing, sort of an Antonio Banderas type, while the athletic woman he loves (Parkour figures into the plot), Valentina (Belinda), reminds me of a combination Leslie Caron and Natalie Portman. The (highly-principled) male juvenile, Ulises (Pee Wee) resembles a young Matthew Broderick. One sub-plot involves a decades-long trial where we can see that a lawyer is bilking his client; another features the specter of a long-missing son; while a third centers around a long-festering need for revenge. Great, great villain, Augusto Ponce de Leon, is played by Guillermo Garca Cant.

Yup, some unusual psychic stuff and LOTS more action than we expect in a telenovela. Of course there is the usual choppy editing that is inevitable in condensations of this nature, but this one is a cut waaaay above average, that's why I've ordered my own personal copy from Amazon.",1365984000,3,1418,5.07725321888412

4482817,4,B004VLLW8S,I just finished watching the first dvd I liked it but I was disappointed that so much of Ulises and Solange scenes were cut out like their first kiss.  Other than that the quality is good and its worth the $15.,1325808000,4,210,4.121951219512195
4482818,4,B004VLLW8S,"Al principio no me atrapo la idea de Tener el Dvd de Camaleones, ya que solo habia visto Originalmente el Primer Episodio Completo, luego de hacer unos balances y de pensar Decidi apostar por el Dvd ya que me demanda menos tiempo que viendola por Television o a travez de Internet.
Me Gusta Mucho Belinda y Alfonso Herrera, hacen una Linda Pareja, por otra parte Me Tienta Mucho la Actuacion Estelar de Edith Gonzalez y Confio en que es Muy Buena en lo que hace, he visto muchas Novelas con ella y Me Encanto.
La Trama parece estar buena y ser una Novela Vanguardista. Espero no desepcionarme...
Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal esta la Novela y el Resumen...
9/8/2011: Buen Dvd, Contiene un Resumen de 13 Horas, 9 Minutos con Lo Mas Importante de la Novela, ademas Trae Bloopers, Videoclips del Grupo, Detras de Camaras etc... Esta Muy Bueno, Lo Recomiendo!!!",1311811200,2,875,4.579617834394904

8443530,3,B004VLLW8S,"This is the only DVD release of an Univision Novella called Camaleones. Now I love this show and I was so happy that I finally got my hands on it. But the more I watched, the more I noticed that this DVD release cut this show. It's not only minor scenes removed. They remove large amounts of this wonderful Novella. I barely watched an episode and a half(Note that the episodes are an hour each in the DVD and their supposed about 48 minutes each.) And the show had skipped through almost 10 episodes and skipped a lot or scenes. This makes it feel very rushed and ruins it. At least for somebody like me who watched this show on T.V. A full proper release would be appreciated. But if you never seen this on T.V from the beginning, than you'd probably enjoy it better than I would. It still makes sense for the most part, just that it might feel a bit rushed.",1368662400,,860,4.25
