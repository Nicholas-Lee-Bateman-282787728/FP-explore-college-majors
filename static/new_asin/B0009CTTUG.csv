Joey lost to Marik in the semi-finals.  Kaiba lost to the Pharaoh in the semi-finals.  Now, Joey challenges Kaiba to a duel to see who wil1 get third place in the Battle City tournament!!!  This duel is very intense and exciting, as it shows something that many Yu-Gi-Oh! fans were eager to see since the Season 1 (Duelist Kingdom) episode THE SCARS OF DEFEAT.  Joey and Kaiba try their very best and both of them battle like never before in a fantastic duel whose outcome might surprise you.  Even though Kaiba starts off strong and gets the upper hand with his Crush Card Virus card, Joey makes some outstanding and amazing comebacks!  We also see a few seconds of action were Tea (under the control of Marik) comfronts Yami Marik and fights him.  This Joey vs. Kaiba duel is excellent and very well played - but that's not the only reason why I recommend buying this DVD.  This DVD also contains the first 40 minutes (2 episodes) of the most anticiapted Shadow Game since Yugi vs. Pegasus!  Yes, this DVD contains the beginning of Yami Marik vs. the Pharaoh!  Finally!  What we've been all waiting for is here!  But, like I said, only Parts I and II of THE FINAL FACE-OFF are here - so, if you wanna watch the other three parts, you'd better buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Gi-Oh-Season-3-Vol-5-The-Final-Face-Off/dp/B0009MAO6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu-Gi-Oh!: Season 3, Vol. 5 - The Final Face-Off</a>.  Of course, don't do anything before you see Joey square off against Seto Kaiba in this unforgetable duel for third place! Will Kaiba loose?  Or will Joey?",1198713600,2,1843,4.977124183006536
8059035,4,B0009CTTUG,"The duel between Kiaba and Joey is good and fairly quick.  Joey's ability to hit gold when using his Time Wizard so he can get out his Thousand Dragon is getting over done (they need to miss or loose sometime).  Of course Kiaba's ability to get his Blue-Eyes on the fiels, and sometimes in threes, just doesn't do justice to the actual card game.  I mean really, how many times can you pull off a triple two tribute monster summon in 2 or 3 turns?  But Kiaba makes it took easy.

The begining of the BIG Marik vs. Yugi duel is the main attraction on this DVD though...and so far, it does not dissapoint.  Once again, Marik is WAY over the top and getting quite creepy.  And with 'good' Marik and little Yugi's souls on the line, you know it will be a good duel!  (Of course when I say 'good' Marik, this is still the guy who was wanting to destroy the Pharo and control the world so he's not exactly 'good' now is he?)

Anyway, FIANNLY at the big climax of Yugi and Marik's duel that has been building for the entire season so it's a definite must see for anyone following the show!",1126742400,6,1082,4.213592233009709
