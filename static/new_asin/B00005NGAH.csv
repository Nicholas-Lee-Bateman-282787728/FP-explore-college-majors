1634097,3,B00005NGAH,"It's got the graboids. It's got gun-toting survivalist Burt. It even has the typical humor. Yet, it isn't quite the same as watching the first two Tremors. I've always been a fan of the first two, with my favorite character being Burt (Michael Gross), and I thought the movie would hold out when all of the focus is laid upon him. But, it's really amazing how much things change when Earl (Fred Ward) is removed from the mix. The missing chemistry is too much to bear and the plot seems to collapse on itself due to the unfamiliar, undeveloped characters that have been ""thrown in"" to fill out the story. The painfully obvious computer-generated creatures don't really help either.
At this point you're probably wondering why I gave it ANY stars. Well, I do have a deep affection for this movie series, so I can't bring myself to completely hate it. Plus, Michael Gross' character, Burt, is always fun as heck to watch. With his overpowered weaponry and over-the-top survivalist attitude, the chuckles keep rolling in through the whole movie. The new creatures introduced in the movie are interesting as well, even if they are computer-generated in 85% of the shots.
The bottom line: It's decent, but not up to the typical Tremors caliber. If you're a die-hard Tremors fan like myself, buy it to complete your collection...",1002153600,,1323,4.807017543859649
1634098,4,B00005NGAH,"The original Tremors was an instant classic. A monster flick in the tradition of the 50's. Tremors 2, despite the absence of Kevin Bacon, still had Fred Ward, and in my opinion is still the best direct to video sequel ever!  Well, now Fred's gone and all we have left is Michael Gross. And, THAT'S ENOUGH! Gross' Burt Gummer character is easily a fan favorite from all the films and here he takes center stage, nicely shared with new character's Desert Jack and Walter Chang's grand-daughter (or is it niece? I forget.) The new characters are much better than Grady from Tremors 2 (I'm glad he didn't return).  Nice to see the returning faces from part one as well. The love story goes different than you would think from the set up, in a very refreshing change of pace. The Graboids evolution comes full circle!  And while I'm sure it didn't have the biggest budget in the world, it looks pretty good and polished. Longer than the first film even, maybe 5 minutes could have been trimmed from here and there but that's nitpicking. Ariana Richards once again entertains a scene with a 2 legged beastie and a freezer like she did in Jurassic Park. You can tell the Stampede entertainment folks really care about the audience, instead of swilling out something straight to video sequels (Darkman, Disney films, anyone?) A good time, defintely if you've liked any Tremors films, and has a soon to be classic Burt line, ""Is your head up you a$$ for the warmth?""

1634118,5,B00005NGAH,"Perfection is not quite the sleepy little town it once was, there's a Graboid Safari scam run by new resident Jack Sawyer (Shawn Christian), the little twerp Melvin Plug (Robert Jayne) is back as a land grabber, and now there's some ill-advised government agents, plus a paleontologist, who want to consider Graboids an endangered species.  But the minute eminent domain is mentioned..................Burt is off and running!  ""It's the gun guy!""  Michael Gross has perfected Burt Gummer to the nth degree and finally, he has the whole movie to himself (as few can keep up with him at this point).

Not being satisfied with just one transformation, the Graboids/Shriekers shed their skins and become something unexpectedly wonderful (also aptly named).  It's a progression that makes perfect sense and adds a lot to the complication of surviving in that itty bitty town in the middle of nowhere.

I consider this movie almost equal with the first, certainly a lot better than the second installment.",1368662400,3,999,5.135802469135802

1634121,3,B00005NGAH,"The good thing about this movie is they got most of the original cast to return, except for Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. The bad thing is that this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original. Burt Gummer returns to Perfection, Nevada and it's too boring. Soon, a Graboid returns and changes into an 'Ass-Blaster' because they can fly by shooting fire from their [...]. Burt teams up with Jack Sawyer and Jodi Chang to try and stop them. If you're a hardcore fan, you might enjoy TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION!!!",1292630400,,513,4.468085106382978
1634122,5,B00005NGAH,"Judging by the fact that the reviews for this movie are more mixed than say, ""Tremors"" or ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"", ""Tremors 3: Back To Perfection"" seems to be sort of the odd man out among the ""Tremors"" series. However, if you've got it in you to enjoy a campy monster-horror movie with a good dose of comedy, ""Tremors 3"" will definitely be enjoyable!

Fred Ward is back to star in this movie, full of the high-action, explosion-heavy thrils of the first two movies. And like in the first two of the series, the Graboids change form, which I personally like, because it adds an exciting twist to each movie. In this case, they are heat-seeking flying beasts, humorously named A##-blasters (I mean come on, you HAVE to appreciate that!). Different as they may be from the Graboids in the first two movies, these ones are just as exciting and entertaining. And at about 1 hour, 40 minutes, the movie is long enough to keep you into it, but not so long that you lose your interest.

Combining the thrill and fun of this movie with the extra features on the disc, this DVD is highly recommended, especially if you get it in the ""Tremors 4-Pack"". And be sure to catch it in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,,1221,4.520361990950226
1634123,4,B00005NGAH,"The town of Perfection Nevada was the setting for the most bizarre animal attack in history -- graboids, vibration-sensing monster worms that erupt out of the ground to eat people.

And eleven years later, ""Tremors 3: Back to Perfection"" revisits this dusty small town when the graboids make an unexpected reappearance -- and the government promptly causes even more trouble. Michael Gross (who stole the show in the previous ""Tremors"" movies) gets to take the lead in the second sequel, which suffers from a bit of dodgy CGI but is still a fun, gore-splattering little horror-comedy.

After a shrieker-obliterating mission to Argentina, BUrt Gummer (Michael Gross) returns home to Perfection, and finds that the tiny town is being hassled by the putrid Melvin, now grown into a slimy real estate agent.

What's more, a thrillseeker named ""Desert Jack"" Sawyer (Shawn Christian) has started taking tourists out on safaris full of fake ""attacks."" But when Jack's slimy assistant is publicly gobbled down by a graboid in full view of the tourists, the people of Perfection find themselves facing another graboid invasion. Burt is ready to go out and hunt them down... only to be stopped by government agents who intend to protect the ""oldest rarest endangered species of the planet.""

To avoid being ""eminent domained"" out of his home, Burt agrees to help the agents. But he encounters some bizarre problems -- and when the scientists are ripped to shreds by shriekers, Burt and Co. find themselves trapped by a giant albino graboid. But the real danger comes when they manage to escape... and find that the shriekers have metamorphosed into a third stage: butt-blasting winged creatures, which Jodi names ""ass-blasters."" Will Burt be able to shoot down the ass-blasters... without his guns?

There's something of a feeling of sequelitis in ""Tremors 3 - Back to Perfection"" -- we've got the basic everybody-runs-and-hides-from-heat-seeking-monsters formula, followed by clever ideas to  kill them one by one.  Been there, done that, own the Chang T-shirt and the graboid hand puppet.

Fortunately Brent Maddock does do a good job injecting some new twists into the formula: pompous and inept government meddling, Melvin's sneaky money schemes, the Great White Graboid, and the full-circle phase of the graboid life cycle. Since ""Tremors 3"" also served as a springboard for a short-lived TV show, it actually has some clever additions that spice up the straightforward plot and leave it open for more amusement.

And the plot, while familiar, has plenty of snappy dialogue (""I'm a masterpiece of self-destruction"") peppering its action scenes and suspenseful moments. Maddock liberally strews the story with high-speed chases in dusty trucks, splattered orange goop, an annoying sidekick, and the occasional massive explosion. And while the main focus is on the bombardier-beetlesque ass-blasters, the graboids also get some attention as well -- including as Burt being eaten alive by a graboid (and being very messily extracted).

Burt doesn't fire nearly as many guns in this movie, although there's a fun scene involving a WWII antiaircraft turret. And Michael Gross gets to have plenty of fun as an action hero, while showing the wonderfully paranoid Burt starting to figure out how he can use the system for his own ends. Christian makes a nice if slightly weird sidekick (""Stop with the zen zingers!"" Jodi orders him), and Susan Chuang follows up as the newest Chang store-owner.

""Tremors 3 - Back to Perfection"" retreads some familiar ground, but the superb Michael Gross and some fun additions to your typical ""Tremors"" story keeps it fresh. Definitely still worth watching.",1242864000,,3679,5.197635135135135

1634125,3,B00005NGAH,"""Tremors 3"" is a fun-filled 90 minute trip that should only be taken once.  The action is cyclic but the plot leaves the mind standing at attention.  One good aspect of this film,  being a sequel,  is that it is not necessary to see the first two films to comprehend and enjoy this film.  Perhaps the cheese factor is high,  but so is the fun.  Not bad,  just not worth watching twice.  Purchase,  watch and pass it on.  You'll be passing on a great night of fun.",1213315200,,463,4.206896551724138
1634126,3,B00005NGAH,"As the title implies, Tremors 3 brings us back from Mexico into the small Nevada town of Perfection.  Burt Gummer has returned home after a Shrieker(the name now given to the two legged land walking creatures spawned from Graboids)extermination in South America.  It doesn't take long however for the Graboids to set their sights on Perfection again after an 11 year absence.  All of the minor characters who survived in the first film are back along with newcomers, Jodi Chang(the daughter of the ill fated store owner Walter Chang, who now runs the store), and a buffoon named Jack who does Graboid ""safaris"" for tourists.  Burt teams up with Jack and Jodi to eliminate the Graboids and Shriekers, but now find themselves facing a new group of monsters dubbed ""Ass Blasters"".  These creatures are apparently what happens when Shriekers reach full maturity, and they complete the life cycle by laying eggs on the backs of Graboids.  They look like skinny, winged Shriekers and propel themselves through the air by flammable gas emissions from their butts.  Most of the film is spent with Burt, Jack and Jodi running around through the desert playing cat and mouse with these creatures.
This is my least favorite of the four Tremors films.  By the time you reach a Part 3 of a movie series, you always run the risk of repeating yourself to a lesser degree.  Tremors 3 really does have a been-there-done-that vibe going on.  Aside from the new monsters, it really doesn't bring anything new to the table.  Even the new monsters are unimpressive since they're CGI, and a rather bad CGI if I may add.  Even some of the Graboids are CGI this time, and that's no good.  The running around in the desert with the Ass Blasters seems rather long and tedious.
On the positive side though,  The Tremors formula still does work from time to time(it was directed by the second half of the original writing team, Brent Maddock, but strangely neither him or Steve Wilson wrote this film).  It's got it's funny and clever moments(one good moment has Jack convincing his group of tourists that they are under a Graboid attack.  Once the group has made it to the safety of a large rock, Jack scares them into thinking they might be stranded there for days and uses this opportunity to try to sell beverages to them), and it's nice to see the old townspeople again.  Michael Gross is still fun to watch too.  This movie is rated PG, but I'm not sure how it got by with that rating considering it has pretty much the same amount of gore and profanity as the other films.  Oh, well.
Though I wouldn't highly recommend this movie, it isn't without it's entertainment value and it certainly a step above a lot of direct to video films in the horror genre.",1209945600,2,2733,4.65625
1634127,2,B00005NGAH,"Well, nobody could have expected the first movie with its giant, burrowing worms to be as good as it was.  And we certainly didn't have any right to expect that the sequel to that film would be nearly as clever and entertaining.  With this third installment, the ""Tremors"" series finally ran out of gas.  Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) was excellent comic relief, but he's too much of a characature to command leading man status.  The tired script doesn't require the characters to think their way out of their dilemma the way the previous two movies did.  A scene in which Burt survives being swallowed is particularly ridiculous, as is the latest matamorphosis of the graboids.",1180051200,,676,4.843478260869565
1634128,4,B00005NGAH,"Ok..Ok.. I have to admit I didn't think they could really pull off anything with a third entry......I was wrong! This is not as good as the original or the second film, but what movie sequels are? The FX are not as good in the film with CGI ""Graboids"" and ""Shriekers"", but I give them credit for having a new mutation ""A S S Blasters""! This is a very funny addition to the franchise and well worth viewing for a fan of the series. I rate it 3 1/4 stars. The DVD is a very good transfer too!",1173916800,,490,4.010204081632653
1634129,3,B00005NGAH,"If you are looking for a complicated, deeply moving movie, this is not what you want.  This is strictly a film for light entertainment purposes only.  I personally love the entire Tremors series.  Tremors 3 takes you back to Perfection to find yet another form of Graboids causing problems for the residence of this tiny town. There is a new store owner,

a guide service and what would Perfection be without Burt Gummer?

It's fun, it's light and it's entertaining.  It's a nice break from some of the other ""heavier"" films.",1173312000,,525,4.714285714285714
1634130,5,B00005NGAH,"While the first in the series offered a dry satire on B-Movies, the third in Stampede's franchise continues the preposterious comedy of the second. Survivalist Burt Gummer is back in Perfection Valley, where a host of new Graboids have shown up ready to eat its way through the town inhabitants.

Joined by newcomer Graboid enthusiast Desert Jack and entrepeneur Jodi Chang, it's up to Burt to put the Graboids back in place. It wouldn't be Tremors, however, if there wasn't a suprise or two, and without giving too much away: there's a third evolution which has to be seen to be believed!!

It funny, well-paced and fans of the series will relish in the chance to rejoin some old characters and smirk with knowning glee as Burt whittles off his infamous quips!

Look out for the fourth film soon, and a Sci-Fi channel TV series from January 2003. I for one can't wait!",1152144000,3,869,4.666666666666667
1634131,2,B00005NGAH,"Tremors was a homage to the 1950's horror classics.  Tremors 2 was a decent enough sequel that it had enough comedy to keep you entertained, high tech weapons to show, and gave you enough Burt Gummer that you enjoyed the movie.  So the producers thought that even more Burt would be a better movie.

It could have been.  But going back to tired old cliches of running out of ammo, and blowing up his place - sorry, been there done that.  Not funny anymore.  Bad script writing destroys what could have been a good movie.",1141689600,,520,4.421052631578948
1634132,1,B00005NGAH,"I say, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It ruined the series and even as a stand alone it sucks. Ignore this crappy schlock and stick with Tremors movies (in the order of) 4, 1, and 2.",1122336000,,204,3.7674418604651163
1634133,4,B00005NGAH,"Tremors took itself somewhat seriously, but it was a horror/comedy like Evil Dead, and it realised it.  Tremors 2 seemed to take itself even more seriously, but it seemed that it was trying to be more humorous as well, so it was sort of imbalanced and didn't make sense.  Tremors 3 doesn't lie about it's low status as a V-release, and goes almost straight to comedy to distract the audience from any low production qualities, and it does an excellent job even though the film looks, and is great.  Well, now Val, Earl, and Grady are gone and Michael Gross is living alone back in Perfection which has become a tourist attraction.  One of the best thing about this film is that every single cast member who survived the first movie (not including Val and Earl) return, and are played by the same actors.  If you were a fan of the first two movies and have not seen this, you will be pleasently surprised.  This isn't the weekend trash that they play on the Sci-Fi channel, it's alot better.  It obeys the rules of the 3rd film in a series, going back to the roots (in this case the town from the first movie, and reuniting the characters).  I laughed so hard at some of the things in this movie, and was amazed by other things such as some of the special effects and creature effects.  CG always turns me off though, so that was a downside, but this movie is still great, see it.",1113609600,5,1379,4.376470588235295
1634134,3,B00005NGAH,"This second sequel to the classic TREMORS is better than the first sequel but again can't come close to the original.  With that in mind, though, credit the writers for adding some fresh new features to the monsters, like exploding farts, etc., and a much better second banana in Shawn Christian.  This one's pace is a little slow at times and Michael Gross continues to become more caricature than character, but he is still fun to watch.  Ariana Richards, Susan Chuang and Charlotte Stewart are fun in their roles and good old obnoxious Melvin is back, all grown up and trying to sell real estate.  I miss the giant worms being the focal point, the shriekers weren't that fun either, but the assblasters are pretty effective.  As in any series of movies like this, the novelty begins to wear off and you risk losing interest.  If the writers can continue to morph the graboids, though, who knows?",1101254400,3,898,4.687898089171974
1634135,4,B00005NGAH,"I really wasn't expecting much from a third in the series even tho Tremors 2 added so much more imagination. So I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be so much fun.
It begins with a rather cool opening scene in which Burt Gummer (still in Mexico) takes out zillions of Shriekers with a massive machine-gun tank thing. After returning home to Perfection Burt must deal with new graboids, new shriekers and another metamorphosis...The shriekers turn into Ass-Blasters, flying creatures with rocket propelled farts. As the town (and the returning, surviving cast from the first film) is besieged by all forms of these animals, Burt and his pals must figure out increasing desperate ways to destroy them.
There's loads of energy and self-referential humor and the locations have a more dark/sophisticated look to them than in the previous 2 films. A light-hearted tone is still in check tho. There's even one teriffic scene in which Burt is swallowed by a Graboid and taken halfway across the desert. I paniced, I honestly thot we'd lost him. Turns out he's okay in the end.
Fred Ward is definitely missed tho his abscence is explained (Earl and Grady went to make a Graboid amusement park) but Michael Gross is simply irreplaceable as the eccentric and paranoid Burt Gummer. And Ariana Richards is so much more cuter now that she's grown up.
Tremors 3 is the best presented Tremors movie on DVD. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 is reasonably lively with lots of bass during the tunnelling scenes. A fair amount of extras come along too.",1082160000,14,1575,4.858736059479554
1634136,2,B00005NGAH,"I was disappointed in this one. Gross comes back as Burt and Fred Ward like Kevin Bacon in the first one doesnt come back but some other ones from the first one come back as themselves in this one. remember the annoying kid in the first one who was stuck on top of that shed, well hes back. goes good but its stupid premise, assblaster tremors, not a good name and it wears down the plot that the first one had. bummer",1066694400,,418,4.109756097560975

Not as bad as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"", and whole lot better than any other film about giant, subterranian carnivorous worms, ""Tremors 3"" does credit to the series and those of us that love it.
The CG effect Grabiods don't resemble the originals made out of pumpkin guts and pantyhose, but ol' Burt Gummer is still  just as much fun as ever.  Burt's license plate has changed from ""UZI 4ME"" to ""UZI 4U"" so you know he's the same and that you are in for more of the treats from the first two movies. (BTW, I tried to get the state of Montana to issue me either plate and they wouldn't)  Many of the original residents of Perfection Valley, NV return, too, older and no wiser.
Hint: In Tremors 3 there are many references to things said or done in Tremors, the original. If you have watched, (and memorized, as I have), the dialog from the first movie, it is a lot more fun...",1058745600,2,989,4.25
1634139,4,B00005NGAH,"The TREMORS series just refuses to go down without a fight. The original TREMORS was a classic film with many suspenseful moments. TREMORS 2 was more of a ""gore and guts"" fest with the appearance of the Shriekers, the offspring of the Graboids that can walk above ground and have heat sensors on their heads to detect anything warm that can be used for food, which causes them to multiply. TREMORS 3 started out with the reappearance of the Shriekers and Burt Gummer in another memorable performance by Michael Gross. Then the old-fashioned Graboids actually come back to terrorize the peaceful Perfection Valley, Nevada. But what would a TREMORS film be without the original Graboids doing some stalking? Burt, with the help of a man named Jack and Jodie Chang, a relative of Walter Chang (who was killed in the first film) begins a Graboid hunt. In the process, the Shriekers begin to shed their skin and sprout wings to become the bum-blasters, vicious, flying monsters with flammable insides that allow them to launch themselves into the air for flight.
All in all, TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION has the typical setup of its two predecessors. What makes it an entertaining sequel is the same thing that made TREMORS 2 entertaining. It delivers more of what we love: Innocent civilians running around, trying to MacGyver their way out of dangerous situations with prehistoric meat-eaters. It not only gives us that, but a fresh healthy dose of comical gore and a new Graboid metamorphosis to feast our eyes on.

The old worms are back in Perfection Nevada after 11 years with one in particular ""el blanco"" who's hunting Burt. The new creatures: ""... blasters"" are entertaining. The funniest part of the movie is when Burt is asked what will happen if the ...blasters get into his food stocks and he replies: ""...-blaster Blitzkreig"". Juxtapose that with ""Hill Street Blues"" and it just kinda tickles.",1042502400,,536,4.836956521739131
1634141,4,B00005NGAH,"TREMORS 3 continues the story of giant underground worms or ""grabiods"" and returns back to where it all began, Perfection, Nevada. With Earl and Val out of this movie, its up to Burt, the survivalist and the remainder of the town to stop the graboids. This time not only are they able to turn themselves into dog-like hopping creatures but now also have become able to change into a flying menace!!
Tremors 3 does maintain the sense of comedy and suspence found in the first two films but it fell a bit short of being completely satisfying. Most of the special effects shots would have been better if they had skipped the CGI and sticked with the animatronic creature instead. Overall this is a good sci-fi action movie, however, I would strongly recommend watching TREMORS first, then TREMORS 2: AFTERSHOCKS and if you still want more go for this one...",1041897600,,854,4.7

1634143,4,B00005NGAH,"This is, in my opinion, the best of the Tremors movies. Why? Because it's the funniest, and people don't watch Tremors for the action or suspense, they watch it for the humor. The makers of Tremors 3 knew what makes Tremors fans tick, and they provide it in a bigger dose than ever before. I really don't want to give anything away, but some pretty hilarious sh** happens here, and clever ways are always found to waste the critters. There is also the usual dose of the senseless violence, shallow characters, and bloody Grabboid chunks that we all love so much, presented in a very playful and silly way.
If you're looking for something that will win Best Picture at the Oscars, look somewhere else. If you're looking for a classic horror movie that will give you nightmares, this isn't it, either. If you're looking for the most imaginative and hilarious ways to blow up big ugly worms, or if you wanna see big flying lizards light their own gas and rocket through the night sky, this is the ticket!",1032825600,2,1001,4.566666666666666

A new character is introduced, who resembles Brad Pitt a little bit, but if you don't like Brad Pitt don't let that keep you from this movie.  The character is good, like all the characters in this movie. Other original characters return, like Nancy and the almost-grown-up Mindy, and Melvin has a cameo appearance.
Once again, the creatures in the movie undergo a change that makes fighting them more difficult; new strategies are required.

The movie opens with Burt blowing away an army of Shriekers in Argentina. Shortly after he returns to Perfection, Nevada; a place that has expanded some since the end of the original movie. Melvin, Miguel, and Mindy and her mother still live in the town, but there are several newcomers too. Tourists arrive by the dozens to see the famed town where the Graboids first appeared. However, three more of the creatures suddenly arise and trouble soon ensues. Burt is called upon to hunt the monsters down, but is prevented from doing so by the U.S. Department of the Interior because the ""animals"" are an ""endangered species"". Most of the graboids soon morph into Shriekers and not long after complete their evoluntionary phase my morphing into Butt-Blasters.
TREMORS was a great movie. TREMORS 2 was a fairly well made sequel. TREMORS 3 has a lot of heart, but not much stamina. The film still has a lot of campy fun that the first two movies did. The special effects aren't bad, but the CGI stuff doesn't look as real as the animatronics. Having some of the other original cast members back in the film is nice, too.
It's especially a treat to see Michael Gross as the lead for once. However, even though he is the film's lead and carries the movie, he's often designated to a secondary stature by the two newcomers to the series. The film would have worked much better if Burt would have either taken on the Graboids single-handed or if he had been given a romantic interest or even better yet, a little bit of both. The lack of a ""buddy"" element really hurt the movie.
Overall, not too bad of a sci-fi flick. If you're a TREMORS fan, you'll want to watch to see how things tie together. However, if you're not a fan of the series, the movie is just average.",1019001600,2,1868,4.5625

El Blanco was a nice twist, but the flying ""...blasters"" are just a bit predictable and it was done in the second film. Plus, the lines some people say is just rediculous. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and will most likely buy it, but it could have been better. But perhaps it wasn't meant to be a big success, more of a traditional B-Movie or Cult Classic, so in conclusion I think the Tremors series reached a fitting end.

This time, the residents have to take on a new mutation, the ...-blasters. Direct-to-video sequel features surprisingly good special effects and production values, but it's not nearly as much fun as its predecessors due to the lack of chemistry between the leads, unfunny gags and jokes, a mostly grating musical score, and bad pacing. It does get pretty fun in the last 10 minutes, though it's a little too late by then. This one's definitely missing Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward.

This movie fails to be anything. It's premise could have been written by an elementary school student! It has by far the worst special effects of the three fims( the graboids,in original form, look like block figures). Burt Gummer was by far the least interesting character in the first two films and they gave him his own movie(although he is good in small doses). The violence and body count of the first two aren't matched. THE MOVIE IS PG! FAMILY IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR CENSORSHIP!!!!! This movie was just plain terrible!",1014076800,,700,4.519685039370079

It lacked a lot of what made the first two movies truly fun to watch.  The 'buddy' movie aspect is totally lost as the lead characters never really meld.  Burt himself was always a loner character and should stay that way.  He just doesn't play-off of anyone in this movie the way he did when he was a secondary character.  Anyway, if you liked the first two, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this one to complete the storyline.

1634155,2,B00005NGAH,"This latest installment in the ""TREMORS"" series proves that the novelty and fun of the original film has now finally run its course.  The original ""Tremors"" was a fun, exciting throwback to giant monster movies of the 50's, but with a sly, humorous modern edge.  The first direct to video sequel ""Aftershocks"" surprisingly retained the original's clever action, fun characters and witty dialog, even making fun of itself for being a sequel.  A pleasant surprise considering most sequels really bite.  Now we have this 3rd direct to video adventure and it fails on almost all counts.  First of all, the original cast has diminished to only Michael Gross remaining.  Sorely missed is the rough and wily antics of Fred Ward.  Instead we get two new characters, one an Asian shopkeeper, the other a not-too-smart country boy.  Unfortunately, these new characters come off as forced and unrealistic, spouting the one-liners in vain.  Our new team of one-dimensional characters  have to fight a new strain of graboids who can now ""fly"".  That's the BIG twist!  What's next?  Graboids that can swim?  Snooooze.
Yep, after a somewhat promising first 30 minutes, this sequel falls into a formulaic series of boring monster attack scenes.  Lots of CGI, lots of mechanical puppets, lots of whiny characters....but no suspense, humor or believability in any of the characters or actions.  It just goes on and on.  This viewer started daydreaming and drifting off after a while and had to constantly force himself to concentrate on what was happening on screen ....not a good sign for an action film.  If it can't hold your attention and you don't care what happens...what's the point?  These tremors don't even register a .01 on the Richter scale.
Surely there will be viewers that find this sequel entertaining and worthy on it's own grounds, but if it wasn't a ""Tremors"" film, it would look just like any other bad recent sci-fi monster picture.  Look at it that way and it really is simply a waste of time.  Sorry - truth hurts and this one cost me (...).  Ebay is calling.",1007424000,4,2064,4.870689655172414

The best thing about this movie was the new Graboid design; now they can fly, or glide is more accurate, by shooting flaming farts out of their butts (which was the only thing even mildly amusing about the whole movie).

The truth is that they could have done a lot better. Maybe it was the fact they wanted to keep it family oriented or they just didn't have the time or financial capabilities of making a successful sequel. One can depict from the start that a movie made for home video only can't be of outstanding performance; it has its gaps somewhere. It is worth buying though if you are a Tremors fan. Burt returns as the fully loaded armed and dangerous vigilante, which is what keeps this movie alive. The opening sequence makes the movie look great, but the new actors just screw up the whole plot as the movie proceeds. There are some positive notes that one can look forward to though such as: Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, trailers from all three Tremor movies, and some other DVD extras that liven up the film. Over all beware before buying this one. Don't be fooled by the cover; it is nothing like the others where Burt goes insane will all of his weaponry. Burt has the weapons, but just when one thinks that he is about to unload he doesn't. It must have been the low budget that the crew had to deal with that ruined the action. Also there are some errors in the film that one can catch if you look hard. There is one obvious error that I cannot believe it was released without anyone noticing was: on the trailer for Tremors 3 they put the names next to the picture of the actors, but Burt's name is misspelled as Bert!",1006387200,5,1578,4.33445945945946

Some of characters from the original return for this one (Melvin, Miguel, Mindy and her mom).
The story, well Graboids are back and this time they mutated to somethings that have wings so they can fly. The DVD is OK for straight to video materials. The picture is bright and clear and the sound is about average.
Now if Universal can re-unite all original casts from Tremors (Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward) and make another sequel with bigger budget, I am sure fans will be lining up to buy tickets.

 In the latest, Tremors 3 : Back to Perfection, we are taken back to Perfection, Nevada where the first movie takes place. Burt (Michael Gross) is the main star in this entry, and we first see him shooting down a herd of Shriekers in front of a frightened tv crew. This was a great opener for Tremors 3. We are then introduced to new characters (Shawn Christian & Susan Chaung) and some familiar faces from the first Tremors. Tony Genaro (Miquel), Charlotte Stewart (Nancy), Bobby Jacoby (Melvin), and Ariana Richards (Mindy) all return. And this makes this movie more at home than the second, and gives a great feeling to it. And also many references to the first. From Walter Chang's store which is now ran by his granddaughter Jodi Chang to the infamous Perfection Valley water tower.

P.S.  One minor quibble: I think most of the special effects shots would have been better if they'd skipped the CGI and gone back to the puppetry and miniatures of the original.

When I found out that Stampede Entertainment was making a third one, I'll admit my hope's shot through the roof.  If they used the same care and understanding they used to make Tremor's 2, the completion of the trilogy could only meet with success, alas this was not the case.  Don't get me wrong the film was watchable, but unfortunatly, lacking that special something that made the first two films true classics.  Maybe it was the obvious cheap CGI graboids, or the characters that you just didn't seem to want to care for, or possibly the proposterous 3rd generation creatures, that were laughingly unfrightning.

The film is set 11 years after the initial graboid attacks in the first film, and returns to where it all started: Perfection. Burt Gummer is back, joined by many of the cast from the original movie, including Mindy and her mother, Melvin, and Miguel. They are joined by two new faces...Jack (who runs a seedy `Graboid safari` complete with simulation attacks), and Jodi Chang who runs the store. (A relative of Walter Chang from the first movie).
The plot is straight forward. Burt returns from a Shrieker exterminating mission in Argentina, to his home valley of Perfection. When a simulation Graboid attack turns out to be the real thing, Burt steps up to do what he does best! Take them out!
You have a lot of monster for your money in this movie. Graboids, Shriekers, and yes...a whole new Graboid evolution, which all tie neatly together, and more is explained about the Graboids. Some are the classic model stuff, and some are some CGI. I won`t ruin the surprise of the new evoltion, but like me, you can probably figure it out from the trailer ;)
There are some great set pieces and action scenes in this movie, and a few shocks besides...Including one fairly early on involving one of the main characters..Which turns out to be one of the comedy highlights of the movie. The dialogue is as snappy as ever, and the movie is as strong as any in the franchise...I wasn`t disappointed for a minute, bar one moment, which I`d semi-expected, but was still sad to see.
This movie doesn`t let up for a moment...Comedy, action, and some great `in-stuff` for the diehard fans of the franchise, including information about some of the previous fave characters; and indeed, the legacy of one of the past characters, actually helps our usual suspects out in the last reel. Well paced, directed, and acted... I`d recommend it in a heartbeat. I`m certainly not ashamed to have it sitting in my collection.
Michael Gross is fantastic (as always), as Burt...This has to be one of the greatest ever characters...He is the star of this movie, and shines even brighter now he has the full attention of the spotlight. What this character doesn`t go through in this movie! :))
The DVD includes some great behind the scenes stuff, and trailers for all three Tremors films.  I only wish the behind the scenes stuff was longer.
A must buy...If you loved the first two movies, then hopefully this one won`t let you down. I just hope the creators don`t make us wait another five years for the next one!

Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) returns to Perfection Valley after extinguishing Argentina's Shrieker (the Graboids second mutation stage) population, to find that his home town has been transformed into a tourist trap.
Worst of all, Perfections newest resident, Desert Jack (Shawn Christian) set up a universal studios style attraction, in which he takes paying customers around a fake graboid spotting tour.
He gets more than he bargained for, when the tour becomes more than a set-up...
Once again the Graboids are on the loose, metomorphosing into their smaller forms, the Shriekers, and into a totally new stage in their life cycle. Its now up to Burt, Jack and the local store owner Jodi (Susan Chuang), to stop the beasts from over running Perfection, and spreading further afield...
With class B acting (although the actors do have their moments when they shine), and some minor flaws in the special effects (hole 'appears' for CGI Graboid to leap from), these are the only bad points to this fun flick, which was created to be exactly that.

I loved that they had the original townspeople (at least those that survived :) all back with the original actors, including a now grown Melvin and Mindy. Like the first two, this is more comedy than horror and the body count in this one is the lowest of the three as well. The ""Behind-the-Scenes"" bonus material is pretty good too. Hope they make a fourth!",1002585600,,571,4.607843137254902
