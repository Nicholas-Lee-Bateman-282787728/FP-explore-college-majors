This pan of the DVD has nothing to do with Clay Connor or any other artists mentioned as being on this DVD.  They are  legitimate and fine  entertainers so if you are interested in their music, please look for it elsewhere.  I wish I could say as much for the legitimacy of the director.",1211414400,3,424,4.2375
8261655,1,B001693O70,"Does this video actually exist?  Nobody at the so-called ""Convention"" saw any camera operators.  Is that runtime correct?  2 minutes?  Is that what they are calling ""an extended jam session"" these days?

30 dollars for a two-minute video that may or may not exist.  Yup.  Sounds like a good deal to me.",1211068800,4,302,4.6923076923076925
