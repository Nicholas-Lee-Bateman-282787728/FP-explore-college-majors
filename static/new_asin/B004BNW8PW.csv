8422088,5,B004BNW8PW,"i appreciate Kino's contribution for helpless ashtanga yoga practitioners who has lived in isolated rural area cannot find any moderate teachers.
Her guidance is very cool.
I recommend the sincere practitioners who always consider inner voice and routine self practice, Kino guidance always clear voice which can easily caught by Jaanese intermediate English level.
Kino has pointed out how to focus our consciousness during the practice, and relationship between each postures.
The challenging pose is quite difficult for solo practice but she show the preparation in standard postures in primary series and how to enhance the body movement to beyond our weak points step by step.
Kino's guidance speed is very trustable for aspirants, when the hard posture I didn't, she changed voice vibration more encourage and naturally I was pushed and achieved my high targets.
She has showed American style's attitude having self confidence friendly minds, and teach exactly without emotional negativeness.
I have learnt American style education is considering how the people need to join the society positively.
The country admires the liberty, freedom under the gods.
We are equal under the gods.",1458864000,2,1190,5.437837837837838

8422093,5,B004BNW8PW,"The introduction is very detailed as well as the demonstrations.  Kino doesn't leave anything out.  Basically your ear and brain picks up what she's explaining when you're body is ready for it...you gotta try it...follow it...repeat...then things start to make sense.
One of the best yoga dvd's I've purchased.",1364774400,2,310,5.3061224489795915
8422094,5,B004BNW8PW,"I've never practiced with Kino directly.  However, I found this DVD to be very good.  Kino breaks the DVD into two segments: one with the natural flow and the latter part as a deeper dive into select poses.  The first helps me understand the rhythm of the sequence; the latter helps me on the poses I get stuck on.  For instance, on the kapotasana pose, I have been practicing it consistently and watching the DVD segment of it once a month to make sure I'm picking up certain tips.  This really helps because it's easy for me and others to get stuck in the way we approach things.  Her tips help",1356134400,7,596,4.324324324324325
8422095,2,B004BNW8PW,"Pros:

- Fantastic information offered, and lots of useful information for how to approach some of the difficult asanas in this series.

- Thoughtful format, offering both a practice DVD (less detailed, more emphasis on the flow of the practice) and a workshop DVD (specific instruction on how to work towards each asana)

Cons:
- The narration is frankly awful.  Wordy and superfluous barely stopping to pause in her narration, which has an effect that's the opposite of meditative.  The DVD would be greatly improved if she were more thoughtful and economical with words.  So.. despite the fact that the David Swenson and Richard Freeman DVDs contain less information, I use them more often because they are more pleasant to listen to. I've practiced with this DVD about 6 times since I bought it 18 months ago. Each time I notice I turn it off before it finishes resorting to silence instead, because the incessant chitter chatter is so mentally busying.

- The way Kino speaks is unfortunately unnatural and affected in this DVD. Like she's is trying too hard to sound sage-like.  On You-tube, she has a wonderful casual and friendly manner about her which is far more likeable.  Perhaps she sounds more like her natural self in more recent DVDs.  Fingers crossed.",1351900800,12,1268,4.883177570093458
