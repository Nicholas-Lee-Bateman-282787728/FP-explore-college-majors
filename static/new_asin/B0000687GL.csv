8275770,5,B0000687GL,"This was a great movie.  I loved it.  The movie focuses on a family livin' the ghetto life, showing the struggles they went through.  This 17 year old black girl gets caught up in some drama with an older white guy that she fell in love with.  Like most ""ghetto drama"" movies, it ended tragically.  Unlike 99% of the big budget movies, this movie doesn't end almost right after the tragedy.  This movie rolls on for another few minutes, showing some things that happened after the tragedy, etc.  In big movies, the action ends and the movie over.  In this movie, along with other lower budget movies, the story continues on after the action(or tragedy).  Throughout a movie you get to know the characters, and then tragedy occurs, which attacks your emotions.  Then 99% of the movies end, right after the emotions you feel after a tragedy.  In this movie the emotions are still attacked after the tragedy because the movie shows the after effects that the family has to go through.  Y'all know what I mean?  This was a great movie, and I recommend it to people that don't discriminate movies by the size of their budget.",1029283200,3,1120,4.595959595959596
8275771,5,B0000687GL,I love this movie and I strongly suggest the director to write another story and make me one of the characters. I could definitely bring the character to life.,1028937600,,159,4.517241379310345
