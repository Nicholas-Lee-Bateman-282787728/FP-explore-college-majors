7834361,4,6303025617,"""The Body in Question"" (First aired November 4, 1991) is one of several episodes of ""Northern Exposure"" that suggests famous people have found there way to the remote Alaskan town of Cicely.  What happens is that Chris in the Morning (John Corbett) discovers a body frozen in a block of ice.  The figure appears to be dressed in the manner of the 18th century, so Maurice (Barry Corbin) decides to keep the body on ice at the Brick until they can figure out what to do with it (there has to be a money making opportunity here for Minnifield Communications).  Holling (John Cullum) and Maggie (Janine Turner) translate the French writing in the journal found with the body and then learn that Pierre Le Moulin was fishing in Alaska with his bon ami Napoleon Bonaparte during the Battle of Waterloo.  You certainly did not see that coming, did you?

If that is not enough to get your interest, how about the diary's suggestion that Napoleon had a child by an Indian woman, because Marilyn (Elaine Miles) knows about a local tribe of French-speaking Indians called the Tellakutans (Did Napoleon stay long enough to teach them French?).  In due time the Tellakutans show up to claim the body, which does not set well with Maurice at all.  Meanwhile, Hollin and Shelly (Cynthia Geary) are at odds, he because he has discovered some unsavory aspects to his French ancestors and she because she is worried that she is infertile.  At the store Ruth-Anne (Peg Phillips) has to tell Ed (Darren E. Burrows) to follow his heart when the would-be filmmaker starts to question his talent.

This is a solid episode from the third season of ""Northern Exposure,"" but not a classic.  Mainly because it terms of unveiling Cicely's past it immediately gets compared to the classic episode ""Cicely,"" which means it has to suffer in comparison.  The episode was written by Henry Bromell, who also wrote ""The Big Kiss,"" and includes Chris reading from Marcel Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" so it does end on the following deep thought: ""When from a long distant past nothing persists, after the people are dead, after things are broken and scattered, still alone, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long, long time like souls, ready to remind us, waiting, hoping for their moment amid the ruins of all the rest, and bear unfaltering in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence the vast structure of recollection.""",1134950400,3,2453,4.816666666666666
7834362,5,6303025617,"Wow, it's refreshing to read other reviews from people who are still watching Northern Exposure in 2001.  I thought I was the only one who religiously watches the reruns on cable. I am adding the videos to my collection. The writers were brilliant when creating this show; they developed characters who were memorable and had something meaningful to say. You don't see that very much in TV anymore.",988416000,6,398,4.852941176470588
7834363,5,6303025617,",This is one of the best shows of all time. This episode received a glowing and detailed review on the CBS sunday morning show with Charles Kurault in 1990. I am thrilled that it is now available on vhs since my own taped copy was destroyed by poor storage conditions. the scope the story is grand.the individual characters are used to great effect.if you are familiar with the series but have not seen this episode I recomend without reservation",987033600,3,446,4.658227848101266
7834364,5,6303025617,"This episode grabbed me by the throat and never let go.  I saw it when it initially aired, and waited religiously for it to air again so I could tape it.  I have always been a Northern Exposure fan, but this episode was at the same time the epitome of NE, and far beyond it.  There are so many outstanding scenes and such an overwhelming gestalt, that this episode is quite likey one of the top ten episodes of ANY show in television broadcast history  Yes, that includes the Newhart series finale and The Simpsons ""Homer the Heretic"". (For the unititiated, there have been ALOT of shows in television broadcast history.)  The best scenes are 1) the town meeting where Chris and Joel debate the esoteric nature of truth vs fact as the plaid shirted townspeople cheer them on 2) Joel's hypothermically induced dream of his ancestors' (whom he has never met) passover seder in the old country where he meets elijah the prophet and 3)Holling's explanation to Joel why his bloodline is cursed and so he ""desires no heirs"".  If by any chance the author of this sublime script ever checks in here to look at the reviews, pls email me so that I can write you a proper fan mail.",984441600,25,1170,4.495283018867925
