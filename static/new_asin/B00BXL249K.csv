With her unconventional attitude, Shaz gleefully sets to work transforming the girls into proudly unique individuals.  But when a mysterious shark hunter (Liev Schreiber) throws a twist in her plans, its up to the girls to change their destiny and find their own happy ending. This is one of those funny/.sad/strange movies. Toni Collette, Live Schreiber and Anthony Lapaglia are terrific, as is the entire cast especially the 5 girls. I was disappointed when it went, very suddenly, from a cute and funny movie to a much more serious and grim one. But it was good I hung in a did enjoy it.

5680744,4,B00BXL249K,"Considering the amount of over the top comedies that get great reviews, I don't know why ""Mental"" is getting bad reviews. Oh, I know! Neither Collete, LaPaglia or Schreiber are in the spotlight when it comes to fashion or looks. ""Mental"" is an Australian film written and directed by the same person responsible for ""My Best Friend's Wedding"".

LaPaglia is the mayor of an unimportant town in Australia running up to be reelected. His problem? He is part of a very disfunctional family. His wife goes ""on vacation"" and this is where Collete and Schreiber enter the film. Who is Collete? She brings sanity to the five unconventional daughters of the couple, although Collete and Schreiber have a story of madness of their own.

The film is a comedy as it is a drama. It has a message as it is over the top, and ultimately it is like having a conversation with an insane person: funny and exasperating, thought-provoking, moving and irritating. I am not saying it is a life changing experience kind of film, but it is interesting to know that there are other comedies out there to choose from the same Sandler, Ferrell and Stiller options we are constantly offered.",1406246400,,1163,4.724137931034483

The greatest gift, along with Judy Davis, that Australia has given us!
Anthony LaPaglia, who is never afraid to tackle any kind of role, and Liev Schreiber who gives us an over-the-top performance. I haven't seen anyone chew the scenery like this since the days of Bette Davis! Plus, the frosting on the cake, it's from P. J. Hogan who gave us ""Muriel's Wedding"". A shady politician. An owner of a shark-tank side show. And a kookie woman with her dog, picked up on a street, and hired by the politician to look after his five
unruly daughters. Put it all together and you have a brew that's definitely someone's cup of tea and someone's bitter drink. Not for the general population at all, but strictly for the select few who like their vice---well---versa.[...]",1379203200,5,1147,4.627450980392157

5680763,2,B00BXL249K,"I'm beginning to worry about Toni Collette. While I realize that she is an actor (and a fine one) who is only playing a seriously unhinged character in P.J. Hogan's ""Mental"", it's just that she's played these seriously unhinged characters so frequently, and with such unflagging gusto, I am starting to wonder if this woman really is off her rocker. And if she is, know that I'm not judging.

In this outing, Collette (who made her bones as Hogan's leading lady in his 1994 hit ""Muriel's Wedding"") plays a Nanny from Hell named Shaz (think Mary Poppins meets Courtney Love). She hitchhikes into a New South Wales burg, accompanied by her trusty dog, Ripper. She's picked up by Barry Moochmore (Anthony LaPaglia), an exasperated father of five daughters. He is at wit's end, because his wife Shirley (Rebecca Gibney) who has a history of mental issues, believes that she is Maria von Trapp. Consequently, Barry, an ambitious politician, has sent his wife ""on holiday"" (the laughing house) on the eve of a campaign. What to do about his daughters?

For unfathomable reasons beyond the ken of any halfway responsible parent, Barry offers the off-the-wall Shaz a gig as the family nanny. With his wife tucked away under psychiatric observation and his children under possibly psychotic supervision by a total stranger, Barry can now get back on track with his true passions: philandering and politicking. Needless to say, this highly dysfunctional home environment has imbued the Moochmore sisters with assorted neuroses of their own; but as we've learned from similar (and superior) films like Bill Forsyth's ""Housekeeping"" and Eugene Corr's ""Desert Bloom"", it's nothing that the Kooky Free Spirited Auntie can't cure with a few wacky bonding escapades and ""just between us girls"" heart-to-heart sessions.

A wild pastiche of general hysteria, screeching actors, busy sets and loud colors, ""Mental"" is a cacophonous, anxiety-inducing assault on the senses. Hogan told an interviewer that the story is loosely autobiographical, that there really was a ""Shaz"" who played a similar role in his childhood. That's nice to know, but why turn such a potentially interesting personal memoir into what amounts to a live action Saturday morning cartoon?  Now that I think about it, it is not unlike a Pedro Almodovar film; except Almodovar seems to know when to put a sock in it and allow his narrative to breathe a bit. While there's something to be said for quirk, ebullience and verve (of which this film certainly has no shortage), Hogan refuses to let viewers up for air, leaving us to drown in his enthusiasm.",1375056000,,2602,5.03016241299304
5680764,4,B00BXL249K,"This movie should give you a stitch in your side.  Sometimes, the truth is truly stranger than fiction as it is based on the writer's own experience.  ""Mental"" is soon to be classic for lover's of off beat humor.  If you liked ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Stranger than Fiction"" and other a little off center humor, this movie should be in your library.
The wife of a small town mayor is a little too happy for those around her, thus labeled crazy by those who find her joie de vivre (keen or buoyant enjoyment of life) to irritating.  Soon she is in a mental hospital and her numerous daughters are under the care of Toni Collette as their nanny.  Toni is truly the one in need of medication but because she functions in such an unusual manner people are a tad to afraid to challenge her.  Thus the laughs ensue.  The gem of this movie is that valuable truths surfaces about what matters in life.  Soon the wife is released from the ""unit"".  The wayward mayor is forced to examine his lack of connection and involvement to his children; and face his failure to appreciate his wife.
Other character's are also forced to see their own shortcomings and face a choice to change or remain in their self-created prisons.

At the end of the day even with great actors like Toni Collette (a pure joy to watch in her goofy, mental guise) and Liev Schreiber (is he an Aussie?), even great acting can't save poorly conceived scripts. There is just enough dark humor to keep you entertained and the opening scene with the family matriarch hanging her laundry in her subdivision backyard while singing the opening to Julie Andrew's Sound of Music (as if the matriarch was really in the alps and not in podunk suburbia), is delightful. In fact there is a lot in this movie which is delightful, but the ending is where the whole narrative implodes and becomes a bit of a generic yawn.

Barry, their absentee father (Anthony LaPaglia), is also the mayor of the town. He decides to solve the issue by having Shirley committed and provides for the girls by putting Shaz (Toni Collette) in charge of them. He picked her up hitch hiking.

Shaz has her own way of doing things and explains that all of Australia is crazy. Her antics have an ulterior motive which we discover late in the film. Shaz has a refreshing brutal honesty to her approach.

The movie is a bit long. The first hour is zany and will have you laughing out loud. The film then shifts into a more serious mode, imitating a dark comedy up to the heart warming ending that brings it home from the opening. Good one P.J. Hogan.

The film is a must for quirky indie lovers.

5680779,4,B00BXL249K,"It's a story too weird to be true -- after his wife is committed to a mental hospital, a neglectful politician hires a hitchhiker to care for his kids.

But it actually was true, and it happened to the family of Australian director P. J. Hogan when he was a child. Years later, he sculpted this too-weird-even-for-sitcoms story into a delightfully peculiar, over-the-top comedy with potty humor, musical numbers and the occasional pickled shark. But it has a bittersweet core about loss, disappointment and mental illness.

Sweet Shirley Moochmoore (Rebecca Gibney) is treated badly by everybody -- her cheating, neglectful husband Barry (Anthony Lapaglia), her snobby neighbor Nancy (Kerry Fox), her doll-obsessed sister Doris (Caroline Goodall) and even the girls at a local coffee shop. So she eventually has a nervous breakdown, and ends up in a mental institution.

Barry demands that his five daughters claim she's ""on holiday in Wollongong,"" mainly because he's up for reelection and doesn't want the bad press. But he quickly discovers that they can't run the house themselves -- especially since all five are convinced that they suffer from various mental illnesses. So he hires a random hitchhiker named Shaz (Toni Collette) to look after them, and goes back to ignoring his family.

At first Shaz terrifies the girls, but she quickly converts them to her life philosophy: the ""normal"" world (especially Australia) is insane, and the ""crazy"" unconventional people are normal. She teaches the girls to mess with the bullies in their lives, and even encourages teenage Coral (Lily Sullivan) to pursue her first romance. But what does Shaz have to do with a mysterious shark hunter (Liev Schreiber) and what is her real goal?

""Mental"" is one of those ""heartwarming"" comedies that would feel corny if it was just churned out of Hollywood. But since the story comes from someone who actually lived it, it has a very genuine feeling -- especially since it tackles some heavy issues, such as mental illness. Not only does poor Shirley have a nervous breakdown after years of being treated horribly, but one of her daughters suffers from full-blown schizophrenia.

And despite that, it's still uproariously funny. Hogan makes the whole thing just a little too colorful, zany and over-the-top. It's a live-action cartoon. He careens us through the over-the-top antics of Shaz and the girls --they trash their neighbor's all-white house in a really gross way, Shaz beats up the donut girls, and attempt a commando-style infiltration of a shark exhibit. But Hogan never loses sight of the bittersweetness of a messed-up family, and never stops making you want to see things turn out all right.

If there's a complaint, it's that the movie sometimes doesn't seem to draw a distinction between real mental illness and being beaten down by life. Perhaps that's the point, but that's sort of like saying that Crohn's disease isn't too different from being pressured to go on a diet.

Toni Colette is absolutely brilliant as Shaz -- a surly, wild woman with a pitbull and knife in her boot, who never hesitates to kick normalcy in the face. But we get glimpses of a very troubled, sometimes ""mental"" woman underneath it all, and it leaves you wondering if she wants the Moochmore girls to replace something missing in her own life.

And the rest of the cast is quite good also -- Sullivan, Bethany Whitmore, Chelsea Bennett and Nicole Freeman are simply delightful as the girls, especially Malorie O'Neill's heartbreaking depiction of a schizophrenic child who isn't getting the help she needs. Gibney is heartbreaking as a sweet, gentle woman who has been beaten down by life, and finally gains some strength on her own. And... well, Liev Schrieber is just hilarious when he's being tortured by an acoustic guitar.

""Mental"" is one of those rare comedies that can tackle heavy subjects without losing its wacky, wild attitude -- and Toni Colette's Shaz is worth the price of admission alone. Bring us the mechanical man!",1366416000,9,4016,5.016516516516517

I had to use the subtitle feature because the Aussie dialect is sometimes hard to understand. But that didn't hurt the film. Great stuff.",1530230400,,742,4.628787878787879

8575108,5,B00BXL249K,Toni Collette shines as usual. Wonderfully oddball offbeat comedy.,1524960000,,66,6.444444444444445
8575109,1,B00BXL249K,"Perversions forced upon children and another attempt to ruin young minds.
The tales have been told and we find the good ones repeated over and over. So here we have another attempt by academic know-it-all's to turn their self-indulgent religion of Cultural Marxism into an enticing fable for bored and spoiled children.
Maybe the world becomes too big and crowded, and people only get so far before they cut each other down to size. Then, after rivers of blood and memories denied, can humans merely survive and be satisfied? Does that destructive cycle need to be repeated? Maybe.
So you didn't really believe there was a Tower of Babel and ignored the equation of warning in Romans 1:16-32 ?
""There is nothing new under the sun.""
And this movie, though starting with the bait of a fine song quickly makes the switch to another tiresome, very annoying pretentious effort to impress a warped conventional ""modern"" (vomit) mindset upon bored and impressionable minds. Oh well, another liberal type plays God in an effort to deny Him and the divine humble agreement of Christianity made with the more common ""brutish"" crowd.
Academic liberals look easily down their noses to blame those merchant Brits and Yanks who marched around this world doing what humans do to survive. They blame those of the past for the disease that bothers them inside. They feel the need to impress the other children in the room.and ward off an attack from bullies.
I detest this kind of movie. There is the standard Liberal Agenda ""Lesbos are everywhere"", and the focus on women as the heroes. Standard and typical liberal media hype.
Why should I pick up every piece of garbage in the pile to declare that it's foul? This movie is offal.
This is fair warning to others like me who aren't willing to play along as if it doesn't matter.",1508716800,,1812,4.773885350318471
8575110,5,B00BXL249K,"I always look for Toni Collette movies. She intrigues me. In this, she plays a woman who helps out a family that really needs some help, while something lurks in her background. Funny, sad, completely mental, and in the end life affirming and hopeful. I thoroughly enjoy this movie ... enjoy because I've watched it three times and expect I'll watch it again sometime.",1500681600,,368,4.765625

8575114,5,B00BXL249K,"It's possible that this resonated because of my terrible day but it has all the things that I didn't know I wanted in a comedy. And, it actually pays homage to mental illness and the fact that it is all around us. So glad I watched this, and bravo to the director, cast and staging crew.",1463616000,,287,4.142857142857143
