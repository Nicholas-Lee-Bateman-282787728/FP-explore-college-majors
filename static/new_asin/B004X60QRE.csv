4492077,5,B004X60QRE,This documentary has great footage and presents detailed information on a very important topic. I recommend this video to everyone.,1366588800,4,131,5.6
4492078,5,B004X60QRE,"My Husband is a retired Army Helicopter pilot, & a Vietnam Vet, I got this for him,He really enjoyed this DVD.",1366502400,8,110,4.285714285714286
4492079,5,B004X60QRE,This only contains how we started a new type of warfare with the helicopter.  We had scout or just transport helicopters since the Korean War.  This is an excellent documentary of how we developed and used more advanced aircraft to start an air mobile force.  From troop transport to gunship to medivac it helps for anyone who has never served (or didn't serve during the Vietnam conflict)to understand how invaluable the helicopter was to the troops in Vietnam and how that aircraft help to transform the military into the future aircraft we have now. Very good history lesson and obviousley not a G rated DVD with the content but could be used for teaching 13 year old and above as it is not a Hollywood production and the footage is not centered on violence but on how the helicopter was used.,1363219200,14,796,4.631205673758865
4492080,5,B004X60QRE,"This is a collection of short feature films dealing with various parts of the Army Aviation story in Viet Nam.  None are new, but are Army public information releases gathered together and packaged.  There are nice memories of the First Cav, medevac and gun ships.  It is light watching and somewhat blatant propaganda, but has the tone and flavor of the period.  I was there flying UH-1 and OH-6 helicopters and enjoyed a glance through the window of days past.",1355270400,18,462,4.7375
4492081,5,B004X60QRE,"War was over many years ago, but in this DVD you can see the liberal idea of to ""win"" the war with all the military power of the USA, but reality was another thing. All that people died for nothing.",1332028800,2,198,3.975

Has thanked me several times, and has shared with some of his old buddies who also served in armed forces.",1408147200,,294,4.84

4492086,3,B004X60QRE,About the same as the Air War: Vietnam. It dosen't tell you enough about what was really going on from the beginning to the end of the Vietnam War and the full story of the Helicopter and the logistics support it required.,1406332800,,222,4.309523809523809

4492088,3,B004X60QRE,"Somewhat disappointing! I expected more indepth reporting on the machines and their crews; how the choppers and crew coped with combat conditions...this includes the slicks, gunships and Dustoffs - but they were only mentioned in passing if at all. If you expect to see anything on Australia's combat troops in the war, you'll be disappointed - Australia doesn't get a mention!!!
 However, this series of the Vietnam war is better than nothing.",1398643200,3,444,5.166666666666667
4492089,1,B004X60QRE,"Pathetic and laughable.  An assembly of poor to average quality free-to-the-public film and video clips, set to a very poor (and free) soundtrack which is totally inappropriate to the content and spoils the viewing experience. - review by Matt Ardaiz",1381968000,,250,5.25
