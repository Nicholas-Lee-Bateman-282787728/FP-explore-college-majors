8674188,2,B00MR9HN8E,"Ordered this last week with excitement and anticipation for it's arrival. The cover and description suggest it to be some kind of award winning well-filmed documentary. I was expecting to see a storied narrative of their rise to success. Unfortunately it's nothing more than cobbled together you tube videos of interviews you've probably already seen if you are a fan. Worst part is, not even the interviews really truly tell the in-depth story of the band. Very disappointed. Nothing new to see here. Probably best if you don't waste your $, or better yet, wait till someone uploads this movie to YouTube.",1420416000,10,606,4.950980392156863
