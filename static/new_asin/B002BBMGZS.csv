Unfortunately the director and publisher don't seem to understand that, if you make a documentary for educational purposes it's useless without closed captioning.

8360968,5,B002BBMGZS,I bought this video for my dad because he lived in South Africa 30 years ago and knows a lot about the Bushmen. He really enjoyed it and thought it captured the Bushmen life well. It brought back memories for him.,1339545600,4,213,4.219512195121951
