8115075,1,B000EWC57A,"When I bought this DVD it had a nice true color pinup on the cover, which of course is NOT included in the how to.  You have to have there stencils to get any use out of the video and even then it is limiting.  I do not recommend it.",1217116800,,233,3.64
8115076,2,B000EWC57A,"The DVD inside the ""Pinups Made Easy"" box has the title screen ""Pin-ups With Stencils"", and in fact this is a DVD focused on helping buyers use the Mahon pinup stencil set. Without the (rather pricey) stencils, the material is not nearly as helpful, and you may not learn as much as you had hoped from this video. Deborah Mahon shows how to use the two pinup stencils included in the set, Girlie Girl and Little Girlie. As a user manual for her stencils, this is a good presentation and will help you make either of two pinup images using her stencils and an airbrush. If you had hoped to learn more about the general techniques for pinup art, though, I think you'll be disappointed.",1199145600,3,683,4.472
