4499683,1,B004YJRZQ0,"Paying too much money for this... you can buy the SEVEN seasons (US versions) individually on BluRay for cheaper than this set. Not to mention, these are the UK versions...  If you go to the UK version of Amazon, you can buy this exact set for the equivalent of 90 US dollars. No free shipping because it's international... but I know it's not gonna add up to 50 dollars to ship that internationally.",1353628800,14,400,4.47945205479452
4499684,5,B004YJRZQ0,I caught some of the episodes in the morning when getting ready for work on TNT.  I was curious to see how it all began.  I have not stopped and and up to season 7!  Really well written and exciting.  Great purchase.,1353456000,,216,4.071428571428571

4499687,5,B004YJRZQ0,"This is a great series, even for a made for television show. I've watched it for a while now. I picked this up for my 15 year old son to watch (me too). He and I both really enjoy watching Supernatural. It's got a little bit of a dark edge to it, but really good storylines.",1345680000,2,274,3.9107142857142856

4499692,1,B004YJRZQ0,"this was a 6 season package brand new but from season 3-6 every cd froze/skipped/broke up only 2-3 shows per cd would work.  So basiclly couldn't watch over 1/2 of those seasons.  By the time got to season 3 where they froze, my 30 days was up.  was a real bummer..",1366675200,,265,4.1568627450980395

4499694,5,B004YJRZQ0,"Very Quick Delivery! item in Perfect Condition!
We love this series!! Great music, stories and I want that Black car!
Very good story lines and unexpected turns and twists in the series!
A must see!!! Definitely not a chick flick. We did not get to see Dean and Sam on TV very often
so I got the series all together and spent a whole weekend glued to the TV!
I am on season 5 right now... and loving it!!
I have already got the rest of the series on preorder!!",1365465600,,460,4.122222222222222
4499695,5,B004YJRZQ0,I am so in love with this show. Just watched all 7 seasons. And now I'm starting over again. I just love the show. It's so good. Season six and seven were a little rough but from what I hear season eight is just as good as seasons four and five.,1362700800,,245,3.823529411764706
4499696,5,B004YJRZQ0,"i have been a Supernatural fan since it first aired. however, working most of the time i missed huge chunks of the story & missed quite a bit. so when i seen this set i jumped at the chance & grabbed it! i thought it was a pretty good deal especially for seasons 1-6.

when the package arrived it was packed really well so that nothing would happen to them. all the cases & boxes were surprisingly in excellent condtion & not ruined or torn.

so over all i am pretty pleased with it.  i can now watch the adventures of my fave hunters & angel anytime i want now, without worrying about what is going on in the storyline. cant wait for season 8!",1361404800,,644,4.136

Season 1-6 It was a great season, arrived in good shape.  Our family really likes supernatural.  We watch it together. Thank you",1359936000,,153,5.08
4499701,4,B004YJRZQ0,Disks themselves are in stellar condition. Some of the outer sleeves were damaged. My disks have all of the special features (another commenter said theirs didn't?). It took FOREVER for them to get here (several weeks from GoHastings) but I'll deal since the price was so awesome. Good way to get the whole thing without spending $20 per season.,1357603200,,345,4.864406779661017
4499702,5,B004YJRZQ0,"It's meeting every expectation.  However, what's not to like: perfect casting, things that go bump in the night, damsels (of both sexes) in distress, rollicking apocalpse and the battle between good and evil, and the seen and unseen.

Season one is entertaining.  Season two through 6, down right interesting, and dare I say it, educational.",1356652800,,341,5.163636363636364
4499703,5,B004YJRZQ0,"This series gets VERY interesting once it gets into the angels and demons section, it has a dark feel to it most of the time. Very talented actors and actresses throughout, If you like ghosts, vampires, spirits, werewolves, or anything of the sort then this is a show for you.",1356393600,,276,4.54
4499704,5,B004YJRZQ0,"I picked up this show blindly after so many people had recommended it to me. It is worth the money. A fun show, but a little slow starting.",1356134400,,139,4.0

4499706,5,B004YJRZQ0,"Husband asked for this for Christmas.  It's a surprise.  I think he'll love it.  The box in the picture made me think it's a big box, but it's not, which I was glas b/c I don't like big bulky things!  It's a great set for a great price.",1355270400,,236,3.8541666666666665
4499707,4,B004YJRZQ0,"I never watched this series on commercial tv because I do not enjoy waiting for the next episode.
Also continuity is broken with so many commercials.

The series is great, even though some of the things in the series are a direct affront to Christianity (I know it is fantasy,
but some language and action - a bit too much).

Also, some plots go on too long, such as the whole angels and demons apocalypse episodes. Sometimes series ""too dark.""",1355011200,,444,4.5375

8448379,5,B004YJRZQ0,"This show is so well done, both in acting, scripts and production.  I started watching during the 5th season and decided to purchase all seasons available (6). I recently purchased Season 7 and am considering a T-shirt.  The relationship between the boys and other family members is realistic and impressionable.  Each episode is intense. I'm in my late 40's and a huge fan - so there's no 'idol crush' going on.  Just an appreciation for a superbly produced, directed and acted show with great story lines, special effects and actors.  Can't wait for Season 8 to become available and counting the days till Season 9 begins!",1374537600,,624,4.849056603773585
