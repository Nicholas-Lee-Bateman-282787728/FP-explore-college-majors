8337221,4,B001R23HEG,"- Remarks the bumbling police sergeant: ""Well, you're a good detective, too, Mr. Vance.""

Basil Rathbone made his bones playing dastardly villains on the silver screen. But, now and then, he had opportunity to play the hero. Most memorably, he was Sherlock Holmes in fourteen feature films. And, once, in 1930, he was Philo Vance, never mind that around that same time William Powell was also Philo Vance and on multiple occasions. Powell's Vance whodunits fell under the Paramount banner, except that Paramount failed to lock in exclusive rights to all of S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance stories, and so MGM was able to spirit away THE BISHOP MURDER CASE. And THE BISHOP MURDER CASE happens to be one of the most interesting whodunits Van Dine had ever penned.

When a corpse is found with an arrow pierced thru his chest, our dapper gentleman sleuth is pressed into service by his old friend, District Attorney Markham (this time played by Clarence Geldart). Except that this bit of murder serves only as the opening gambit in a deadly cat-and-mouse game between the bumbling police and a diabolical killer called ""the Bishop"" who delights in leaving behind cryptic clues inspired by Mother Goose nursery rhymes. Oooh, the news media is practically salivating. But never fear. Philo Vance is on the case, quickly taking the reins of the investigation away from perennial clueless foil Sgt. Heath (James Donlan).

From jump Vance has got the wind up, and he ominously observes: ""It is the beginning of a series of murders, ghastly and inhuman."" He's not wrong. It's a decent mystery that holds up today and is cleverly staged and atmospheric. It's got a whiff of that Old Dark House vibe. Rathbone's interpretation was well received, even though, ultimately, it paled when compared to Powell's more polished and charismatic turn. Still, Rathbone excels at poshing it up and I've always loved his diction. It's fun watching Rathbone smoothly negotiate a gauntlet of enigmatic clues, half-wit policemen, and peculiar suspects (that skulking hunchback is a prime candidate). Vance proves that he's not beyond resorting to bluff and dramatic license to pin down a murderer. It's a nice twist ending. This is a 1930 joint, so there's a decided creakiness to it all. You only have to glance at the clunky heart monitor that reverberates loudly with the patient's heartbeats to realize how dated the film is. It's a peek into a lost era. It's worth noting that this picture reflects a period in which Hollywood was transitioning to talkies. Accordingly, MGM released THE BISHOP MURDER CASE in both silent and sound. I wish they'd also release it on DVD. Heck, or even on VHS.

****Edited an hour later*** So, I'm an idiot. I'd already posted this, and then I just got a look at the product description and realized this item is actually a DVD book (NOT an audio book) meant to be read over your computer or iPad screen or you can pop it in your DVD player and read it on the telly. I'd actually read the book but it was so long ago I can't tell nowadays how closely the movie stuck to the original material. I thought about deleting the post, but what the heck, maybe it'll add color to the DVD book and help you decide whether to purchase the thing or not.",1476662400,,3248,4.763765541740675
