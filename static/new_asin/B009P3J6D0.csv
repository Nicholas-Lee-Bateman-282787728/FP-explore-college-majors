5360271,5,B009P3J6D0,"This is truly one of the best tv shows of all time and it stands the test of time. Excellent stories, acting and dialogue with each episode teaching you something about the characters and sometimes about yourself.
Can't wait until the third and final season is available.  I highly recommend this series to anyone. It is a good, wholesome family show.",1358640000,11,351,4.754098360655738
5360272,4,B009P3J6D0,"I will be able to provide a better review of this second season of Eddie's Father once I have received the DVD's as the are estimated to arrive tomorrow.  Season one was like a huge step back in time when I watched this program in Canada as a child and only remember the odd scene and the basic characters, but it is a good show and hopefully the last seaon (season 3) will come available in 2013 and be availble to purchase from Amazon.ca?",1357430400,2,440,4.238095238095238
5360273,4,B009P3J6D0,"I had received this on those ""made on demand"" DVD-R discs, and my disc #2 was faulty - had scratches. Amazon were great and replaced my set free of charge. I was surprised when I received my replacement set that the discs this time were the normal silver ""pressed"" discs, and not the DVD-R discs which look a slight purple color. I can't figure this out. Anyone have any idea of why I might have got DVD-R media, then several weeks later Amazon sent me the silver pressed ones?

Anyway, great content though.",1356825600,2,508,4.462365591397849

5360284,5,B009P3J6D0,"I grew up watching this cute and funny show. A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.

The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.

Season2 is very good, but I personally like season 1 the best because I think the show works best when Eddie is younger, but that's not to say this season doesn't has some great episodes.

If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get. WB has released the other two seasons and they are a bit expensive, but I really enjoyed seeing this again. ......people let me tell ya 'bout my best friend!",1399593600,5,1303,4.420833333333333

5360288,5,B009P3J6D0,"I haven't gotten around to watching this season yet as I am still watching season 1. I do it one episode a week. But I do remember liking this show so very much when it was new. A man getting up in years and my own kids full grown and giving me grandchildren, I like to watch it because sometimes it's just good to be able to back a little in time for a brief moment.",1388793600,5,367,3.8421052631578947
5360289,5,B009P3J6D0,"This 60's series was a real game-changer in terms of father/son dynamics in tv sitcoms: a far cry from the ""Leave It To Beaver""/""Father Knows Best"" paradigm, this show felt real, not a ""situation"" comedy - the humor came from real experiences, told with grace and style. Its innocence, unflinching honesty, and above all, stellar acting from the entire ensemble made this a standout then, and it remains as timeless, enjoyable and frequently poignant as anything comparable on television today - although you'd be hard-pressed to find anything on tv today that even comes close. I related to this show as a child, and as an adult, I find even more to enjoy here - so much so, that I'll even forgive the perfunctory laugh-track (which this show probably could've done without - and would have made it even more groundbreaking.) But that's a minor quibble. Those opening dialogues between Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz were priceless - what kid (me included) could watch this show and not wish for such a loving, beautiful relationship. And the incidental music by Harry Nilsson was the icing on the cake. Highly, highly, highly recommended. A television milestone along the lines of ""Julia.""",1386979200,6,1188,4.945
5360290,5,B009P3J6D0,"This is a well made series that really captured an outstanding relationship between a father and his son. This season seems to shift the focus from Tom's work to his personal relationships. Not that the first season didn't but there is far less about him balancing his job and being a father. He seems to have licked that issue so he doesn't have to make decisions on what is important.

When told he was good with kids the very humble Tom Corbett replies, ""Kids are good with me, I'm just lucky."" Wow! I don't remember my dad or any of my friend's saying that. In the late 60's, early 70's this wasn't a normal attitude. It was still nurturing mom and working dad so COEF was ahead of it's time. While the movie ended with Eddie getting a mom, the series did not see that as a means to an end. Tom's romantic failures bring him closer to Eddie and make him realize how tough a job his wife had.

The first season was an MOD and the discs were typical DVD-R. These appear to be pressed discs so maybe the 1st season showed Warner the should be made en masse. The price is the same, however.

No complaints here. All the episodes look very good for their age. I would have liked some extras like a commentary from Brandon Cruz but maybe that will come with the third season.",1382140800,5,1273,4.295833333333333
5360291,5,B009P3J6D0,This was a great show back in the day. I remember watching this as a kid but now I can watch it to remember what they were really saying. I am looking forward to getting season three to see how it all ended. This was a find on Amazon!!,1374710400,,235,3.816326530612245

5360295,5,B009P3J6D0,"The Courtship of Eddie's Father was my favorite television show growing up.  I loved its charm and innocence, and Bill Bixby seemed to be America's favorite dad at the time.  I remember it wasn't too long ago if you looked for information about this television series on DVD you would only see bootleg websites.  I am very thankful this adorable television series was released to DVD and I hope that eventually we will see Season 3 available for purchase to complete the collection.  Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz were a magical combination.  This is television in a simpler time.  Good quality family television.",1363651200,9,611,4.883495145631068
