The monster scenes must have taken months and months to animate- which is why there are so few in the movie.  It's typical 1950's monster movie stuff and was fun to watch.",1469318400,,323,4.35

612864,5,6303257372,"I first saw IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA in 1957.  At that time, I was in second grade.  A group of kids on school trip were being taken to see OLD YELLER.  However, when we got to the theater it was sold out.  And so, as fate would have it, the mother in charge of the trip took us to see IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA.  It was Bobby Moore's mother.  The Moore family ran a clothing store in New Haven, Connecticut.  A few decades later, I managed to find a DVD with OLD YELLER, and found it boring and depressing, and was very, very pleased with the fact that it had been sold out and that, as a consequence we saw IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA (exciting and thrilling) instead.

The film starts with a tense episode in a submarine, and introduces kids to all sorts of interesting gizmos, such as sonar, Geiger counters, and periscopes. The film gets off to a humorous start, as there is a slight disagreement among submarine personnel as to whether the music played on board should be Hawaiian music or big band.

ROMANCE AND INNUENDOS.  Then, the film dwells extensively on light banter in a marine biology laboratory. The goal of the Navy submarine captain is to recruit the marine biologists to help the Navy predict where the octopus will strike next. But the captain is able to multi-task. His second task is to get cozy with the female marine biologist. The captain is not really subtle about this goal, which is understandable, in view of the fact that his career path requires him to spend years and years in a cramped submarine (in this context, there are few opportunities to learn tactics in courtship behavior). At 20 minutes into this movie, there is a shocking innuendo.  Actress Faith Domergue is holding a standard piece of lab equipment.  It is a graduated cylinder.  Basically, it is a glass cylinder about ten inches long and two inches wide.  She is holding it, and toying with it, so that it is positioned directly in front of actor Kenneth Tobey's belt.  There is no question in my mind what the director and cinematographer were thinking when they filmed this scene.  I am shocked that the censors did not catch it.  The film director is to be commended for infusing the romantic episodes with ambiguity. The calculated ambiguity is this: is the woman involved with the male marine biologist or or with the captain (Kenneth Tobey)? Hints of a love triangle continue, from time to time, throughout the entire movie. In fact, the conclusion of the movie seems to be that the captain lost out. There is not enough romance to dampen a kid's enthusiasm for the plot. And there is hardly any kissing. Therefore, your kids won't be covering their eyes while exclaiming, ""EWWWWWWWWW!""

In a scene in the marine biology lab, there is a prominent sign reading NO SMOKING. But the submarine captain, in speaking with the marine biologists, proves to be a chain smoker. Kids will love observing this discrepancy on their own, as the contradiction is not discussed by any of the actors.

""Woman's liberation"" plays a surprisingly prominent role in this film, the female marine biologist is a university professor, a Ph. D. Other films from this era would not have done this and would have instead given the woman a master's degree, at most.

SCENE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA.  Then we are introduced to the giant octopus. The giant octopus ensnares a ship and takes it down. What follows is an excellent course in psychology, where a surviving sailor is so shocked that he cannot describe the octopus, but merely points to the rubber tubing of the examining physician's stethoscope. The doctor makes some subtle pronouncements, indicating that he believes the sailor to be nuts. The other sailors, waiting their examination, agree among each other to pretend that they saw nothing (to avoid being diagnosed as nuts).  I first saw this movie in 1957, and when I finally got around to buying the DVD version of the movie in 2009, the only thing that I remembered was the scene in the doctor's office where the traumatized sailor stated that the monster looked like the rubber tubes of the stethoscope.

As if the film was not dramatic enough, the octopus attacks San Francisco, tears down the Golden Gate Bridge, and extends its tentacles along the Embarcadero, near an area of San Francisco now named after journalist Herb Caen.

COMMENT ABOUT RADIATION.  The special effects are more than adequate and the dialogue refrains from bogging down in scientific nonsense.  I have only one tiny complaint about the ""science."" The film discloses that the giant octopus is RADIOACTIVE. However, the script-writer may have been a little confused. The way radiation works, is that it induces a mutation in the chromosome, where the result is over-active growth hormone, where the result is a giant monster. If the mutation is in a germ cell, the mutation will be inherited, and the children will be giant monsters.  Thus, it is the case that radiation initially causes a mutation that generates the monstrous octopus, but it is NOT the case that the giant octopus itself can possibly be radioactive.  However, most people won't be bothered by this apparent inaccuracy, about the octopus itself being RADIOACTIVE. (The radioactivity is from an atomic bomb, and it makes no sense to suggest that the octopus itself would acquire the same property). I do want to recommend another excellent movie that concerns radiation-induced giant ants. This is the movie, THEM. The science talk is reasonably accurate and is kept to a minimum, in THEM.

In the colorized version, the colorization is excellent. The color looks about like that in an old color movie, such as Gone With The Wind. The flesh tones, interior of the submarine, sky, Golden Gate Bridge, are all convincingly colored. The colorizing company is identified at the end of the film. I am glad that they did not take liberties, and try to color things to look gaudy or more splendid.",1462752000,,5937,4.764878048780488

However, this is a unique mutant octopus. It only has six tentacles! On his excellent audio commentary for the restored original King Kong, Ray Harryhausen admits that he didn't have the B-movie budget to create eight tentacles, so he only created six!

613027,3,6303257372,"Less a `monster' flick, more a `problem solving' drama.  This sci-fi film manages to balance its thrills with an interesting romantic sub-plot.  Director Robert Gordon does a solid job of giving the movie a large-scale feel considering its low budget.  There are a few moments of silliness, which seem to be unavoidable in B-movie productions like this, but these items are easily overlooked by the strength of the bond between the three main characters.  Special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen recreates the Golden Gate Bridge quite convincingly when the huge sea creature attacks San Francisco.  Also, noteworthy is the pro-feminist theme that gives this project substance.  Overall, this movie is better than it had a right to be.  {The blu-ray has a good amount of bonus material.

""Since the coming of the atomic age, man's knowledge has so increased that an upheaval of nature would not be beyond his belief.""

It is 1955 and the atom sub looks just like a ww2 diesel (at least it does not look like a cardboard mockup.) The latest sub is being chased by thing or things unknown; let's just say that ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"".

Standard sci-fi for the time we have the obligatory romance between the captain, Cmdr. Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey) from ""The Thing From Another World"" (1951), and Prof. Lesleyl Joyce (Faith Domergue) from ""This Island Earth"" (1955). What a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trios and Prof. John Carter (Donald Curtis) from several ""Science Fiction Theater"" (1955-1957) TV episodes.

I just love sci-fi from this time because they inevitably depend of flame throwers to do the trick as in ""The deadly Mantis"" and ""Them!""

Naturally no one believes them until they get eaten. Others think they have the situation in hand. Will we be able to handle ""IT""? And will there be a next time?

Six tentacle monster by Ray Harryhausen; ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981).

IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is the second film to feature the amazing special effects of Ray Harryhausen. Although the plot is little more than a rehash of earlier Atomic Age horrors like THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, it is still competently played and never ceases to impress with Harryhausen's stop-motion animation. The film's signature scene involves the creature's attack on the Golden Gate Bridge. It has also become infamously well-known for Harryhausen's cost-saving techniques in giving the octopus only six arms instead of eight. Scripted by THEM's George Worthing Yates and starring Kenneth Tobey from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA has all of the right elements for a successful Sci-Fi adventure!

To evade it, you dive but then the sub becomes ensnared on the bottom; fortunately, you break free.  Later, an inspection of the sub's exterior finds a highly radioactive mass stuck to its surface.  You order the substance to be sealed in a box and taken to a lab in Hawaii.  Two prominent marine biologist are brought in to determine what ""it"" is.  To be safe, you and the two scientists wear protective suits while examining the specimen.  But when Dr. Joyce removes her radiation suit, you are dazzled by the flash of her sultry dark eyes and momentarily forget about the specimen . . . .

If you are Dr. Leslie Joyce you find the specimen interesting but you've got other duties back at the institute.  Besides, Dr. Carter is tops in his field; he can handle the analysis without you.  You doff your radiation suit and catch sight of Commander Mathews - a good-looking man.  Your interest in him is quickly extinguished, when this man has the audacity to order you to stay!  You grudgingly agree and join Carter in the weeks long testing to discover what ""it"" is . . . .

If you are ""it"", you have been driven from your home in the dark ocean depths.  You were happy there, but then some time ago a strange thing happened: your world shook with a long slow rumble and ever since nothing has been the same; time to move on.  You jet up and up to where the light filters down from above.  You reach up into that light and suddenly you feel no resistance, your arm feels oddly heavy.  You grope around, move on, try again, and then, every once in a while, you find and grab onto peculiar things just above, and yes, sometimes you even find some pretty tasty things - just within reach . . . .

Note: At the beginning, there is footage of the launch of the first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus.

Picture (DVD): 3, grainy.  Colorization: 4 to 5.  Most scenes have a multitude of colors.

Of course when it has been that long,it is the outstanding moments you recall only,like the giant octopus itself and it grabbing on to the Golden gate bridge,etc. But watching it after all those years I kind of re-discovered the film all over again. It actually has a decent plot for a B picture,which stars lead Kenneth Toby(The Thing) and Faith Domergue(This Island Earth).There is a sub plot that is strictly adult(that I didn't recall),as when the submariner says to the captain that he was concerned about the effect of radiation and ones ability to have children,or the Captains own battle of the sexes with this""new breed of woman"".Even so the movie still remains stuck in its' B picture roots,despite Harryhausens wonderful background work.
The plot is relatively simple. An atomic powered sub commanded by Capt. Pete Matthews(Toby) is patrolling the western Pacific area when it is suddenly followed by a huge object unknown. Eventually the unknown locks the sub in a vice like grip. After more than a few tries to get the sub going backwards and/or forwards,the Captain calls for them to surface. It does the trick and a diving crew upon inspection of the hull finds a huge mass stuck in one of the steering vents. They head to Pearl Harbour for repairs and the piece of material is examined by two experts,one being marine biologist Lesley Joyce(Domergue).
The conclusion  seems to be that the substance jammed in the sub belongs to a much bigger creature,a giant octopus. It is theorized that this creature grew to such immense proportions due to Atomic testing around the Marshall Islands. The theory is expounded in detail to the military who have a hard time believing what they have heard. Meanwhile other ships have come in contact with this thing and have met some nasty consequences as a result. And the creature seems to be slowly heading towards the U.S.west coast.
When the creature comes ashore in Oregon,it is not long after that it heads south and arrives in San Francisco Bay. An electrical netting has been spread underwater to protect the Golden Gate bridge and when it is turned on the creature immediately grabs onto the bridge to lift itself out of the water and away from the current. They get the power switched off and it slides back into the water. There Capt. Matthews sub is waiting and they fire a special atomic torpedo into the creature. The plan is to drive it out and then detonate it,but nothing is dislodging the creature. Then Capt. Matthews dons some diving gear,swims to the creature and pushes an explosive device towards it. The creature sees it,moves and it detonates prematurely.
The captain has to be rescued and when he is safely inside the ship they detonate the bomb which eliminates the octo-threat once and for all.
This film has the cold war era stamped all over it in its references to Atomic testings(a staple topic in 1950s Sci-Fi flicks),the ""new"" atomic submarine and all the modern gadgetry seen;all meant to convey the subtle,or not so subtle message,of the might of the US forces at work and on the job. The plot is the old boy meets girl,boy pushes too hard,girl gets testy and backs off,and in the end all is forgiven. Much of the returns for this flick came from the good old fashioned Drive-In,where I can still smell the fresh popcorn and see the young boys and girls out in their parents cars,cuddling during the scary parts and necking at will at other times. Ahhh,the good old days*sigh* ;-)
Technically speaking the film is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1. The film has been remastered and it looks crisp alright,but it is still quite grainy;as most ALL of Harryhausen's Columbia product
shamefully is,with the one exception being the 50th anniversary remastered 7th Voyage of Sinbad edition,which looks beautiful. Columbia attaches a high price to Harryhausen's works but doesn't deliver pristine prints to justify the charge. What is up with that?
This edition comes with the original b&w version along with a colourized copy. Now if you're like me you might be rolling your eyes at the very mention of colourization. I can think back to the 80s when they experimented with some Laurel and Hardy product and the results were,to put it mildly,pathetic. I have always railed against the process because it goes against the original vision of the artists involved. But I listened to a featurette with this set and it seems Harryhausen himself helped to colourize this movie. In fact it was only due to budget restraints way back when,that prevented them from shooting in colour in the first place,which he would have preferred. So with that in mind,and going against my better judgement,I actually sat and watched the colourized version. I must say I was impressed. They have certainly come a long way since the 80s with this process. This version looks very life like and if one didn't know better one could easily be fooled into thinking this WAS originally shot in colour.
The colour,however,did nothing to improve the picture other than its looks,but it is certainly interesting to see the two side by side. Extras include:commentary,a featurette on the film and the music man for the film,an interview by Tim Burton with Harryhausen,photo galleries,original artwork and more.
in conclusion,Columbia has come up with a single sided two disc set of Harryhausen's S/Fx 50s B flick,with lots of interviews and other extras,along with a colourized version of the film which I must admit looks pretty darn good. However the colour and remastered version here does nothing to improve the typical 50s plot. It may have been remastered but it didn't eliminate a good portion of the graininess,and for the high price this set commands(at least in Canada),I don't think it's worth it.",1323734400,2,5865,4.882647943831494

613197,4,6303257372,"It Came From Beneath the Sea, 1955 film

The horror movies of the 1950s used the fear of new science for these stories. They represented people's fears of the dangers of atomic and nuclear war. [""Frankenstein"" represented the man-made horror of the world-wide Great Depression that damaged and destroyed people's lives. The 1975-76 recession saw the most popular horror film that represented a danger from the ocean.] The ""great recession"" in the early 21st century saw movie and television shows about vampires, another threat to people. Entertainment is a distraction from the realities of life, like ""Dancing With the Actors"". Strange phenomena are observed in the Pacific ocean. The scientists study these reports. One scientist is Professor Joyce, a beautiful young woman with a Ph. D.

There is drama from interpersonal actions. The effects of radiation are said to create a giant octopus, which now seeks its prey from larger animals like seals. It seems to come from the Marshall Islands, where a test H-bomb was exploded. Could other mammals be attacked? [Note the styles of clothes, men wearing hats.] People smoke cigarettes (product placement when the brand is shown). When the Navy learns about this threat they search for the giant octopus to kill it. You see examples of ships, helicopters, and airplanes (F9F?) from that era. Recognize them or the automobiles from the early 1950s? They try to find where this monster is hiding. Fishermen report a poor catch. Why did a family disappear near the beach? What made those strange round spots in the sand? We see a tentacle reach out and touch someone. What is the Navy doing to keep the monster out of San Francisco? Can they use dead sharks as bait? A jet-propelled torpedo that will pierce the octopus and explode inside of its head will kill it. Sonar identifies a fast-moving object.

There are explosions, but no effects. ""Red Alert!"" A high-voltage wire creates a reaction by the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects Frisco to Contra Costa county. The octopus is driven out of the water, climbs the bridge, and damages the roadway! The Federal authorities advise people to stay in their homes, but go about their normal business. [Contrary advice?] The Embarcadero is evacuated, and Alameda is warned. Can a submarine attack the monster? Can flame throwers drive it back to the sea? A clock tower by the ferry terminals is destroyed. The monster grabs the submarine! Can anyone attack this monster? In the end the Navy launches its torpedoes to destroy the monster. The heroic volunteers survived for a happy ending.
This story is presented as a documentary. There is no humor here (except from fifty years of hindsight). The actors are typical of what you would expect from a low-budget production.",1322006400,,2766,4.995661605206074

Today, unless a movie's effects make you think the event is actually happening, people will criticize and complain.  It Came From Beneath the Sea has no pretenses to live up to.  The effects are bad and that is what makes this film so appealing.  1955 had no real labs where such effects were made.  The giant octopus actually only had six legs due to the film's limited budget.  But no matter, the film director pulls off his movie without batting an eyelash.

Aside from the bad effects, the acting is really not that bad for a bunch of B movie actors.  The love story is believable and the search for the creature shows a remarkable degree of calmness amongst navy officers and reporters that we could learn from in today's real world.  The reporters wanted the story, not something they could sensationalize.  The Navy believed the accounts of the giant octopus without falling to hysteria or unbelief.

All in all this is a good movie to watch on a rainy night when there is nothing else to do.",1268611200,,1117,4.535
613333,3,6303257372,"""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" should be taken at face value. It was one of the first of the 1950's ""Blame the Atom Bomb for the Giant Monster"" films.

Other movies of the time (i.e. ""Godzilla"" and ""Them"") were better written, better acted, and much more cautionary in tone, warning us about the dangers of mankind's tampering with the laws of nature.

That said, there are some misconceptions about the plot of ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"".

The octopus itself was NOT mutated to it's gigantic size by radiation. It was already gigantic. The hydrogen bomb testing in the Pacific Ocean drove away its natual food supply (how much food would a ceature that size need to eat every day?). So the octopus had to stray from its natural habitat (35,000 feet or so under the surface) to find food. Why the scientists (marine biologists) stated that the octopus's food supply have their own ""internal Geiger Counter"" was never explained, and doesn't make any real scientific sense. The hydrogen bomb tests themselves would have killed off a LOT of marine life from the explosions and massive radiation!

Anyway, the movie itself was / is captivating, as we have the built-in primal fear of gigantic sea monsters that come from the extreme depths of the ocean to eat us humans. (""Jaws"" is the perfect example of this). And with eight tentacles (now simply called arms), the creepy-looking octopus made a perfect choice for the most frightening of giant sea monsters.

Looking past the nonsense of the macho navy man woos the attractive female scientist plot, the movie provides some highly entertaining scenes with the giant octopus. 1) Our first glimpse of the monster grabbing a merchant ship and pulling it under the sea. 2) A poor schlub of a sheriff's deputy (armed with a rifle that may as well have been a peashooter) getting crushed on the beach by a giant tentacle. 3) The octopus ripping apart the Golden Gate Bridge (a sci-fi classic scene).
4) The octopus appearing in San Francisco Harbour, crushing a frieght train boxcar, and pulling itself partially out of the water by grabbing onto a tall clocktower. 5) [my personal favorite scene] a team of Army flamethrower-equipped soldiers firing at the weaving tentacle, trying to drive the octopus back under water. 6) [perhaps the most eery scene] when the male marine biologist confronts the octopus's giant eye, firing an explosive-tipped harpoon into the monster's eye, so it will release the ensnared submarine sent to blow up the beast with a flesh-piercing torpedo.

Forget most of the romantic nonsense. We all watch the movie to see the giant creepy-fleshed, multi-tentacled menace (even if it only has six tentacles, due to a lack of money Ray Harryhausen needed to give the monster his natural eight tentacles).

The scenes with the octopus are extremely well done...especially with the lack of money and help Mr. Ray ""sci-fi legend"" Harryhausen had to work with.

I can only imagine what the classic 1950's ""nuclear bomb created / angered giant creatures"" monster movies would look like if remade today, with loving attention to detail, good plots / writing / acting and scientific facts (see ""Them""...possibly the best of the 1950's ""atomic monster movies"").",1241740800,,3223,4.9335793357933575
613334,5,6303257372,"I am a huge fan of FX master Ray Harryhausen and I love all of his films! I've seen all of the films between 50 and 100 times and I was leery of a colorized version of any of his classic black and white movies. The first one I watch was '20 Million Miles To Earth' which I thought was amazing! the color (which was over seen by Harryhausen) only enhanced the film.

This film is also a treat, but the color does show the imperfections of the print more than in the previous picture I mentioned. What's great about this edition is that you get both black and white and color versions and they can be switched back and forth while viewing.

The DVD also has some excellent features including commentary with Ray Harryhausen and a couple of feature-ettes, stills gallery, etc. Some of these feature are carried over from the other new color DVD's, but it's a nice set regardless. It would have been smart if they included the features from the older editions of these film so we could discard them, but those features appear on a number of Harryhausen DVDs, so I guess it's not too big a deal.

There are some who feel these films aren't classics, but please remember that Mr. Harryhausen did all of the effects himself! He created and built the figures, the sets, did the story boards, the lighting, the back plates, the photography and much more.

Yes! what would take a 100 or more people to do in films now, was done by one man and he did it on a very small budget, so small they could only afford a six armed Octopus! Not only that, there was very little known back then about these effects, so Ray had no where or anyone to turn to when presented with a technical problem. He also invented some film processes that are still used today.

Every person who is making or doing effects in films now was inspired by Ray and his fabulous creations! OK, I know Willis O'Brian invented the stop motion technique, but Ray certainly advanced it to another level.",1240358400,,1955,4.404432132963989

613336,4,6303257372,"Yet another Ray Harryhausen film from the 1950's has just been released on DVD in a two disc special edition.  It Came from Beneath the Sea comes in between The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers.  It's probably the least of those three films but I always liked this one even more than ""Earth Vs...""  This is such a product of the 1950's when the paranoia over nuclear testing was at its highest.  The result was a plethora of films featuring all manner of radioactive-spawned giant monsters: spiders, ants, grasshoppers, and other beasties.  In this film the threat comes from a giant octopus, driven out of its deep sea home by atomic bombs tested at sea.

The first to encounter the creature is a U.S. Navy nuclear sub, commanded by Pete Matthews (Tobey).  The sub doesn't know exactly what they've encountered but a piece of the creature was caught in the Sub's propellers.  The hunk of octopus is taken to be analyzed by two marine biologists, Prof. Lesley Joyce (Domergue) and Prof. John Carter (Curtis).  They determine that the piece belongs to an octopus but one that has grown to enormous proportions.

The creature soon makes attacks on other vessels, sinking an entire merchant ship, and leaving only a handful of shocked survivors.  While the Navy at first dismisses the professor's findings, they soon cannot deny the truth and decide to take action.  The film's climax comes with the memorable octopus attack destroying the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

Like all of these films, it's the masterful stop-motion effects that are the real star.  While the film itself took only a few weeks to shoot, Harryhausen worked on the effects for months afterwards, painstakingly filming the creature's movement's one frame at a time.  Yes, perhaps it looks dated next to today's slick CGI effects but there's a certain admiration you have to have for Harryhausen's work.  He knew these were low-budget B features but that never stopped him from delivering 100% effort.

It Came from Beneath the Sea is slower than the other films I mentioned.  It takes a good 25 minutes or so before we even get a good look at the creature for the first time and the film only runs about 79 minutes.  There is a melodramatic love triangle going on between the three leads.  Matthews is the tough captain while Carter is the somewhat sheepish scientist.  When Professor Joyce tells carter that Matthews kissed her, all he can manage is, ""Did you enjoy it?""

That said, I enjoyed the cast.  Tobey was a great character actor who made over 300 film and TV appearances in his fifty year career.  He was a regular in the 1950's TV show ""Whirlybirds"" and also appeared in such shows as I Spy, Lassie, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Ironside, and Emergency, usually playing some sort of authority figure.  His final role was in an episode of Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine in 1994.  He was a strong, macho leading man.  Domergue's Prof. Joyce was every bit as tough as Matthews.  Domergue was no stranger to Sci-Fi roles, seemingly always playing the role of a scientist.  She also starred in This Island Earth and Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.

Extras: The film comes in either the original black & white or new colorized format. This new Chroma-Color process is vastly improved over the old colorizing process of 10 or 20 years ago and while purists might object, Harryhausen himself approves of the look.

613419,3,6303257372,"By the time IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA was released in 1955, the Second World War had been over only for 10 years, and America had not forgotten the lessons so harshly learned--find the enemy, engage the enemy, and destroy the enemy. Hollywood was in the early phases of releasing a series of films that dealt with Bug Eyed Monsters of various sorts, and this one is typical of the genre.  H bomb explosions cause an oversized octopus to rise from the deepest recesses of the Marianas Trench to seek the food that its now radioactive body render impossible.  Since its normal marine diet of fish are warned away by its radioactivity (the film does not explain how fish can sense X-ray radiation), the huge creature seeks human nourishment.  There are scenes that introduce the creature in a manner that was soon to become familiar to fans of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, RODAN, and GODZILLA. Innocent victims usually vessels are attacked while the world panics and calls for help.  Enter Kenneth Tobey and Faith Domergue as this help, with Tobey as a sub skipper and Domergue as a world reknown marine biologist.  One of the film's more interesting but less publicized aspects has less to do with the creature and more to do with the sociological subtext that dealt with the changing vision of women During Moments of Crisis.  Tobey is attracted to Domergue (Howard Hughes' real life one time girlfriend) and she to him, with the clearly understood subtext that all gorgeous women regardless of their brains were supposed to fall for handsome uniformed macho types like Tobey.  As much as he lusts after her in a manner that must be painful to view to politically correct feminist types today, he still can't view her as little more than eye candy that must be dispensed with when The Going Gets Tough.  Most of the latter part of the film shows the magic that FX magician Ray Harryhausen created with his stop-action camera work even if the background effects also evince the cheesiness and phoniness that result when even geniuses like Harryhausen had to operate on a shoe string budget.  Behind the forced romance of Tobey/Domergue and the FX of Harryhausen lies yet another subtext--this time political.  Much of ICFBTS consists of various scenes of the military reacting to the menace of the creature.  You see soldiers in trucks, destroyers dropping depth charges, and jets searching for survivors.  It is pretty clear that the America of 1955 was a pre-politically correct nation that still retained a world view that the United States was a force for good and when an enemy were to appear (creatures from the sea, aliens from space, human terrorists), it would be patriotic types like Kenneth Tobey we would call upon to save us--even if he still managed to find time for romance with Faith Domergue.",1206144000,2,2811,4.809128630705394

613422,3,6303257372,"Excellent DVD for Harryhausen fans, monster geeks and film historians that treats us to a great example of how far colorization technology has come  since its introduction years ago, and not on a washed-out public domain title.  Supervised by R.H. himself - as are 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH and EARTH VS. FLYING SAUCERS - IT CAME benefits from a more interesting and LIVING color spectrum for its monster, instead of the constant, solid green of the Ymir in the new version of 20 MILLION.  The Golden Gate bridge sequence looks especially good, with the hues of the tentacles contrasted with the red of the bridge, as well as the water tones. Another terrific highlight is the flamethrowers vs. the octopus scene, which again, really sparks in its colorized form. A few of the optical mattes are more noticeable in the color transfer, but there is always the beautiful, crisp black and white version to go back to. Both are included in this package, and you can even toggle between the two for comparisons.  The extras are solid, with R.H. revealing more details about this film than he has previously.  IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA has always been a 50's monster staple, thanks to its wonderfully animated star (and Ken Tobey!), and with this new, finely rendered color version it looks better than ever.",1203897600,8,1305,4.782222222222222

613425,5,6303257372,"OPENING SCENES.  The film starts with an episode in a submarine, and introduces kids to all sorts of interesting gizmos, such as sonar, Geiger counters, and periscopes.  Actor Kenneth Tobey is the submarine captain, and he appears in the opening episode, as well as throughout the entire movie.  The film gets off to a humorous start, as there is a slight disagreement among submarine personnel as to whether the music played on board should be Hawaiian music or big band.  Then, a huge object appears on the sonar screen, where this is followed shortly thereafter by immobilization of the submarine.  Two divers exit the submarine to identify the problem, and they report that they saw something resembling a ""barrel"" but could not identify it.  When the submarine returns to port, it is found that a chunk of biological tissue was stuck in the steering mechanism.

MARINE LABORATORY EPISODE.  Navy brass visits a marine biology laboratory, where the goal is to persuade scientists to identify the origin of the tissue sample that was caught in the steering mechanism.  Then, the film dwells extensively on light banter in a marine biology laboratory.  The goal of the Navy submarine captain is to recruit the marine biologists to help the Navy predict where the octopus will strike next.  But the captain is able to multi-task.  His second task is to get cozy with the female marine biologist, who happens to be a university professor.  ""Woman's liberation"" plays a surprisingly prominent role in this film, the female marine biologist has a Ph. D. Other films from this era rarely or never did this, and instead the female character had a master's degree, at most. Navy brass learns that she is the second most prominent marine biologist in the world, and that the most prominent marine biologist is a man.  Navy brass then demands that the male marine biologist take over the needed analysis.  But then, Navy brass is informed that the male marine biologist had died.  (I was glad to see part of the film, as it does a good job at promoting the careers of female PhD-level scientists, and it also does a good job at putting egg on the face of the male chauvinist Navy brass.)

ROMANTIC OVERTURES.  The captain is not really subtle about his romantic intentions, which is understandable, in view of the fact that his career path requires him to spend years and years in a cramped submarine, without opportunity to learn conventional courtship behavior. At 20 minutes into the film, the submarine captain is making a move on the marine biologist.  This interlude takes place in a marine biology laboratory, and the viewer will see various fish tanks and lab equipment in the background.  The captain stands very close to the marine biologist, and makes continual not-so-subtle remarks about romance.  But the marine biologist does not complain and instead responds with coy remarks that border on being flirtatious.  It should be noted that Hollywood is quite capable of filming scenes where a woman expresses disgust and revulsion, when faced with unwanted romantic overtures.  For example, please see a scene in NO DOWN PAYMENT (1957), where actor Tony Randall dances with actress Patricia Owens at a back yard dinner party.  Both are married to other people who happen to be at the same dinner party.  Patricia Owens cooperates as a dance partner, but it is evident from the pained expression on her face that she feels disgusted.  However, in IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, actress Faith Domergue does not show one trace of disgust.

At the 20-minute point, the viewer will be exposed to a subtle scene that provides a subliminal message.  The subtle scene involves standard laboratory equipment, namely, a 100 milliliter graduate cylinder.  The graduated cylinder has approximately the same dimensions as a man's private part.  In this scene, Kenneth Tobey's private part resides about one foot directly in back of the graduate cylinder that is being held in position by Faith Domergue.  I am not sure how this scene survived the censors, but there you have it.  I have watched this movie at least ten times since I bought the DVD in the year 2009, but today (May 10, 2016) is the first time that I noticed this off-color innuendo.  Amazing!!!

HUMOR ABOUT SMOKING.  In a scene in the marine biology lab, there is a prominent sign reading NO SMOKING.  But the submarine captain, in speaking with the marine biologists, proves to be a chain smoker. Kids will love observing this discrepancy on their own, because the contradiction is not discussed by any of the actors.

OCTOPUS MAKES ITS ENTRANCE, STETHOSCOPE SCENE.  Then we are introduced to the giant octopus.  The giant octopus ensnares a ship and takes it down. What follows is an excellent course in psychology, where a surviving sailor is so shocked that he cannot describe the octopus, but merely points to the examining physician's stethoscope. The doctor makes some subtle pronouncements, indicating that he believes the sailor to be nuts  The other sailors, waiting their examination, agree amongst each other to pretend that they saw nothing (to avoid being diagnosed as nuts).  As if the film was not dramatic enough, the octopus attacks San Francisco, tears down the Golden Gate Bridge, and extends its tentacles along the Embarcadero, near an area of San Francisco now named after journalist Herb Caen.

SCENE WITH THE STETHOSCOPE, DEJA VU.  I first saw IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA.  My group from school, chaperoned by Bobby Moore's mother, was taking us to see OLD YELLER.  But the seats were sold out.  And so, instead Bobby Moore's mother took us to see IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA.  I am so glad that OLD YELLER was sold out because, about 40 years later I watched it, and found it to be depressing.  Anyway, when I watched IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA on a DVD in the year 2009, the only part that I remembered was the scene with the stethoscope where the sailor is in psychological shock.

AMBIGUOUS DEPICTION OF ROMANCE.  The film director is to be commended for infusing the romantic episode with ambiguity.  The calculated ambiguity is this: is the woman involved with the marine biologist or or with the captain?  Hints of a love triangle continue, from time to time, throughout the entire movie.  In fact, the conclusion of the movie seems to be that the captain lost out.  There is not enough romance to dampen a kid's enthusiasm for the plot. And there is hardly any kissing.  Therefore, your kids won't be covering their eyes while exclaiming, ""EWWWWWWWWW!""

SMALL AMOUNT OF SCIENCE NONSENSE.  The special effects are more than adequate and the dialogue generally refrains from bogging down in scientific nonsense.  Many people will be able to name sci-fi films where the dialogue bogs down in to pseudo-science.  No need to mention any of them here.  I have only one complaint about the ""science.""  The film discloses that the giant octopus is RADIOACTIVE.  However, the script-writer was confused.  The way radiation works, is that it induces a mutation in the chromosome, where the result is over-active growth hormone, where the result is a giant monster.  If the mutation is in a germ cell, the mutation will be inherited, and the children will be giant monsters.  However, most people won't be bothered by this apparent inaccuracy, about the octopus itself being RADIOACTIVE.  (The radioactivity is from an atomic bomb, and it makes no sense to suggest that the octopus itself would acquire the same property).  I do want to recommend another excellent movie that concerns radiation-induced giant ants.  This is the movie, THEM.  In THEM, the science talk is reasonably accurate and is kept to a minimum.

The colorization is excellent.  In the colorized version, the color looks about like that in an old color movie, such as GONE WITH THE WIND.  The flesh tones, interior of the submarine, sky, Golden Gate Bridge, are all convincingly colored. The colorizing company is identified at the end of the film.  I am glad that they did not take liberties, and try to color things to look gaudy or more splendid.",1199750400,,8102,4.882783882783883
613426,5,6303257372,"Ray Harryhausen films have finally made it back!
Two releases from Columbia this month include the classic ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" and ""Earth Vs Flying Saucers"" . Celebrating Ray Harryhausen and his amazing contributions to the film industry is an admirable past-time.
""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" was released in 1955 after the begining of the cold war, and the early development of stop action photography by Harryhausen under the supervision of Willis O'Brien. Combining stop action effects with live action photography, ""It Came"" was a technological triumph. A giant radioactive octopus attacks a United States nuclear submarine causing a deep sea search and rapid weapons development program headed by a beautiful scientist (Dr Lesley Joyce).
Viewed from a 21st century mindset, the film runs slow, is filled with stereotypes, and hopelessly old fashioned. However, as a film afficinado, I loved the film with all of its' style and characterization . The discovery of the octopus and destruction of the monster aby the Golden Gate bridge is pure 1950's idealism. The cast of Donald Curtis, Harry Lauter, Faith Domergue, and Kenneth Tobey works well in their battle against nature.
The DVD is presented in black and white as well as Chromacolor. Tim Burton interviews Ray Harryhausen, and a preview of a digital comic book are included. These special features are very watchable and add much to the presentation.",1199664000,3,1425,5.1731601731601735

But the main film is, like ""20 Million Miles to Earth: 50th Anniversary Edition"", on 1 disk in both a digitally-restored black & white original version and newly colorized version. This is made possible by a process called ""Chromachoice"". This allows you to switch between the color and b/w versions of the film at any time by simply pressing the ""angle"" button on your remote. It's a good idea but some would argue that it's flawed in execution. I'm one of those. On my player the ""angle"" icon comes up every time there is a chapter stop and will NOT go away until I press the ""clear"" button. This is very annoying but at least I can get it off the screen! Based on reports on ""20 Million..."" other players will display this icon the entire film. There may or may not be a way of disabling this on your player. Frankly, I would rather choose from a menu which version to watch as the novelty of switching wears off after a while and the annoyance of the constantly appearing icon does not.

The stop-motion is ok but the monster scenes are too few and far between and the octopus has no personality. Thats an odd thing in a Ray Harryhausen movie.

The final 20 minutes of the movie are done well and keep you on the edge of your seat as the octopus reaches out from the harbor looking for a quick meal. The people getting crushed under one of the tentacles is very convincing.

Everything is presented very matter of fact instead of  being dramatic and this tends to give the film a very dry, almost  unexciting feel in the middle.

The story  is not as good as say Earth vs. the flying saucers or Twenty million miles  to earth, but the special effects are fantastic.

Seeking adequate levels of food supply, not excluding humans, the creature attacks San Francisco.  The real  star of this movie is the razzle-dazzle special effects of Ray Harryhausen.  The quality of the stop-motion animation exceeds the constraints of the  B&W photography and the modest budget.  The first part of the film  tells of the mysterious ship sinking and other unexplained marine mayhem  caused by the great sea beast.  Navy Captain Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey)  and two expert marine-biologists, John Carter (Donald Curtis) and Lesley  Joyce (Faith Domergue), work around the clock tracking down clues to  identify the source of the mysterious events at sea.  The simple plot moves  right along and doesn't waste time.  As seems obligatory in many '50s  sci-fi flicks, the heroes endure the ""I'm telling you, there's a  monster!"" phase followed by the ""Yeah, right!"" response from  the authorities.  Happily, that particular cliche is kept to a minimum.  Things  really start to go snap, crackle, and pop as the monstrous octopus  tries to pull itself up on the Golden Gate Bridge.

The film starts with a tense episode in a submarine, and introduces kids to all sorts of interesting gizmos, such as sonar, Geiger counters, and periscopes. The story gets off to a humorous start, as there is a slight disagreement among submarine personnel as to whether the music played on board should be Hawaiian music or big band.

ROMANCE AND INNUENDOS.  Then, the film dwells extensively on light banter in a marine biology laboratory. The goal of the Navy submarine captain is to recruit the marine biologists to help the Navy predict where the octopus will strike next. But the captain is able to multi-task. His second task is to get cozy with the female marine biologist. The captain is not really subtle about this goal, which is understandable, in view of the fact that his career path requires him to spend years and years in a cramped submarine (in this context, there are few opportunities to learn tactics in courtship behavior). At 20 minutes into this movie, there is a shocking innuendo.  Actress Faith Domergue is holding a standard piece of lab equipment.  It is a graduated cylinder.  This laboratory equipment is a glass cylinder about ten inches long and two inches wide.  She is holding it, and toying with it, so that it is positioned directly in front of actor Kenneth Tobey's belt.  There is no question in my mind what the director and cinematographer were thinking when they filmed this scene.  I am shocked that the censors did not catch it.

The film director is to be commended for infusing the romantic episodes with ambiguity. The calculated ambiguity is this: is the woman (Faith Domergue) involved with the male marine biologist or or with the captain (Kenneth Tobey)? Hints of a love triangle continue, from time to time, throughout the entire movie. In fact, the conclusion of the movie seems to be that the captain lost out. There is not enough romance to dampen a kid's enthusiasm for the plot. And there is hardly any kissing. Therefore, your kids won't be covering their eyes while exclaiming, ""EWWWW!""

In a scene in the marine biology lab, there is a prominent sign reading NO SMOKING. But the submarine captain, in speaking with the marine biologists, proves to be a chain smoker. Kids will love observing this discrepancy on their own, as the contradiction is not discussed by any of the actors.

""Woman's liberation"" plays a surprisingly prominent role in this film, the female marine biologist is a university professor, a Ph. D. Other films from this era would not have done this and would have instead given the woman a master's degree, at most.

SCENE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA.  Then we are introduced to the giant octopus. The giant octopus ensnares a ship and takes it down. What follows is an excellent course in psychology, where a surviving sailor is so shocked that he cannot describe the octopus, but merely points to the rubber tubing of the examining physician's stethoscope. The doctor makes some subtle pronouncements, indicating that he believes the sailor to be nuts. The other sailors, waiting their examination, agree among each other to pretend that they saw nothing (to avoid being diagnosed as nuts).  I first saw this movie in 1957, and when I finally got around to buying the DVD version of the movie in 2009, the only thing that I remembered was the scene in the doctor's office where the traumatized sailor stated that the monster looked like the rubber tubes of the stethoscope.

As if the film was not dramatic enough, the octopus attacks San Francisco, tears down the Golden Gate Bridge, and extends its tentacles along the Embarcadero, near an area of San Francisco now named after journalist Herb Caen.

COMMENT ABOUT RADIATION.  The special effects are more than adequate and the dialogue refrains from bogging down in scientific nonsense.  I have only one tiny complaint about the ""science."" The film discloses that the giant octopus is RADIOACTIVE. However, the script-writer may have been a little confused. The way radiation works, is that it induces a mutation in the chromosome, where the result is over-active growth hormone, where the result is a giant monster. If the mutation is in a germ cell, the mutation will be inherited, and the children will be giant monsters.  Thus, it is the case that radiation initially causes a mutation that generates the monstrous octopus, but it is NOT the case that the giant octopus itself can possibly be radioactive.  However, most people won't be bothered by this apparent inaccuracy, about the octopus itself being RADIOACTIVE. (The radioactivity is from an atomic bomb, and it makes no sense to suggest that the octopus itself would acquire the same property). I do want to recommend another excellent movie that concerns radiation-induced giant ants. This is the movie, THEM. The science talk is reasonably accurate and is kept to a minimum, in THEM.

In the colorized version, the colorization is excellent. The color looks about like that in an old color movie, such as Gone With The Wind. The flesh tones, interior of the submarine, sky, Golden Gate Bridge, are all convincingly colored. The colorizing company is identified at the end of the film. I am glad that they did not take liberties, and try to color things to look gaudy or more splendid.",1481846400,,5454,4.859762675296656
