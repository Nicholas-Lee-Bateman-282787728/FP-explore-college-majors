7930682,5,B0000541XF,"VCI Entertainment and Puritan Pictures present ""Lightning Bill Carson"" (1936) (Dolby

digitally remastered)...relive those thrilling days from the early '30s and '40s

when drama took us down the dusty trails and the plains to exciting

adventures....some of the best B-Westerns ever to grace the Saturday Matinee

Screen......the Native Americans had no better ambassador than Tim McCoy, a

former Indian language translator in real life...as Tim McCoy speaks

passionately about this country's longtime abuse of its native population by

breaking treaty after treaty...just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and

suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss any of the Tim

McCoy features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his

B-Western adventures

Under director Sam Newfield, producer Sigmund Neufeld and Leslie Simmonds, screenplay by Joseph O'Donnell, original short story by Arthur Durlam...the cast include Tim McCoy (U.S. Marshal Lightning Bill Carson), Lois January (Dolores Costillo), Rex Lease (The Pecos Kid), Harry Worth (Tom Rand), Karl Hackett (Stack Stone ), John Merton (Brred Hawkins), Jack Rockwell (Sheriff), Lafe McKee (Don Costillo), Joseph W. Girard (John Mount), Edmund Cobb (Deputy Sam Bates). . . . . . . . our story has one of the best veteran B-Western cast ever assembled with Tim McCoy, Rex Lease, John Merton, Jack Rockwell, Edmund Cobb and Karl Hackett... very touching screenplay by Joseph O'Donnell after an innocent man is hanged for a killing he didn't commit and the vengeance his brother is seeking...Lois January is convincing in a scene with Harry Worth as he empties his gun just before facing Tim McCoy in the final showdown just before the closing film credits....another great B-Western for Tim McCoy under the Puritan Pictures banner for Poverty Row, proves to be one of his most memorable performances.

Special footnote, actor Tim McCoy in real life was a sharpshooter and famed for

his fast draw...was an expert on the Old West also an authority on Indian

folklore could converse in Indian sign language...McCoy was inducted into the

""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage

Museum"" in 1973, also inducted into ""The Cowboy Hall of Fame"" in 1974.
