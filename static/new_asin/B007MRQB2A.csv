8557396,1,B007MRQB2A,"This item is a ""RIP OFF""!!!  The Description leads one to think that there is actually some beginner glass blowing technique shown if not discussed, NOT TRUE!!!  The DVD is 13 minutes long  including the intro and fade out which is about 5 minutes then there is about 5 minutes of glass objects that were made by experts.  This leaves about 3 minutes of unexplained intermediate glass blowing.
