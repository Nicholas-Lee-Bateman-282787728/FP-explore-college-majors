2337850,4,B0009XRZI8,"Good product! Not as good as others I have, but good nonetheless. What idiot requires so many words on a review!",1355788800,,112,4.380952380952381
2337851,3,B0009XRZI8,"The film tells of life on board a submarine and the duties of the submariner. Done like a documentary, with commentaries from Tom Clancey and several old WWII submarine skippers, the flick gives the viewer a feel for life on such a boat.

The submarine is the 360 foot long USS Hyman G. Rickover of the nuclear class, named after the man that did so much to establish a protocol for the careful selection of crewmen. Link trainers are shown as trainees experience the duties of flood and fire control. The loneliness of life aboard and the close living space are reasons for bonding of submariners with submariners.

If one is interested in submarines, this is a good film and worth the watch.",1339200000,,693,4.626016260162602
2337852,2,B0009XRZI8,Was excited to show this to my WW2 submariner father i was mare than a little disappointed on the brief content and details......there must be better books out there,1291248000,,165,4.724137931034483
2337853,3,B0009XRZI8,"The photo used on the cover of this DVD would lead one to believe it covers the Fleet Class subs of WW2. They really should have used a Nuclear Sub photo for the cover as that is the main focus of this DVD. The Nuclear Sub footage was probably filmed in the 1970's I guess so the ""look"" is somewhat dated. Why someone has never obtained the ""Silent Service"" TV Series (true stories of WW2 Sub action) from NBC, restored it and made it available to the public is beyond me. Price was right though for a somewhat dated look into subs.",1273017600,18,532,4.2254901960784315
2337854,4,B0009XRZI8,This short documentary of just under an hour gives you a very brief history of the submarine service and an introduction into what it takes to become and live on a US. Nuclear submarine. There is some filming of the crew and operations with a couple of drills on a SSN. This brief glimpse is amazing considering how the service does not wish to share information on a weapon system that relies on secrecy. Having been on a nuclear submarine I can tell you that they filmed on an actual boat and if you are interested in modern submarines this is worth watching for the brief glimpse into that world.,1247011200,21,599,4.454545454545454
2337855,4,B0009XRZI8,"I am always interested in the history and the workings of mililary operations. The DVD movie is a good representation of submarine history. Many often forget that after Pearl Harbor, the 'Silent Service' was the main means of defense in the Pacific until the fleet could be rebuilt. Or that Rickover was the father of our present nuclear navy. A navy that kept this world safe during the Cold War.

The music CD is a pleasant surprise. My wife enjoys that. We both enjoy Mozart.",1231718400,5,478,4.623529411764705
2337856,2,B0009XRZI8,This video is a basic introduction to life on & in a nuclear submarine. It does touch & I mean touch lightly upon the earlier WW subs & some basic statistics about how they performed such a great part in the war against japan. If you are interested in a light glimpse into the nuclear sub except where only the priveledged are allowed then buy this dvd.,1215907200,7,353,4.2835820895522385

2337877,5,B0009XRZI8,"After reading a few of these comments, I wanted to offer some clarification. I graduated high school in 1989, and joined the Navy. My first tour was on SSN 759 Jefferson City, an LA class attack boat essentially identical to the Rickover. Our Chief-of-the-Boat (COB) was the same man in this documentary, so it has always had a place in my heart. When you see the very young men in this film dealing with submarine school or drills on the Rickover, it is EXACTLY what I experienced during my time in the fleet  I even recognize some of the faces. The LAs are being phased out for the new Virginia class, but the specs are similar, and I assume the life is not very different.

This film offers some brief interviews and coverage of WWII submariners, but the focus is not on that or them. They are offered only as context for the modern duty on a nuclear attack boat. I have seen one or two quality documentaries made SINCE this one (its from 1989, after all), but none that have matched or exceeded it in giving the flavor of life aboard a submarine. For history of the submarine, it is brief and introductory. Good  but there is better available for that. If you want to know what life is like on these machines, especially some of the family issues, or the kind of hard men who thrive on them, this is your film. It is as if someone filmed my life from 1990-1993. I will always love this documentary and look at it fondly.",1422921600,3,1424,4.366037735849057

2337903,5,B0009XRZI8,"Submarines have always fascinated me even though I could never be in the Silent Service. My psychological makeup just would not let me be there. A friend of mine from long ago college did go into the Silent Service. I never would have expected that of him. This DVD is amazing, a camera crew allowed on an active attack boat for a three? six? month cruise. The tight quarters shown. It does _not_ matter how big the boat gets, the quarters and other ""rooms"" on the boat are alway tight (a submarine is always called a boat by the way). Extremely interesting even if the LA class is being retired now and replaced by a newer ""bigger"" class of fast attack boat called the ""Virginia"" class. The Virginia class is only 15 feet longer than the LA class sub and has whopping 34 feet .beam vs a 33 feet beam for the LA class. (Beam is essentially the diameter of the hull.) This cruise took place in 1989. A couple my wife and I are friends with have a son on a Virginia class sub. The husband was able to spend a few days on board the sub with his son as they were returning to port in the Fall of 2013. The wife will never be able to do do so. But maybe this DVD will give her an idea of the experience her son went through during training and goes through during a cruise.",1393718400,2,1268,4.158536585365853
