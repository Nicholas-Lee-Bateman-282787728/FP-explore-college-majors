8494987,2,B0068TRTO2,I love FF movies but this was pretty bad.,1470787200,,41,3.6666666666666665
8494988,1,B0068TRTO2,"I know full well that some people post phony good reviews to get more viewers, so I don't normally read the reviews.  In this case, I should have.  What a stinking pile of bad movie.  Terrible acting, lots of people shouting and threatening each other, endless shaky camera and lots of shots too dark to see anything.  This is the most clich&eacute;d film I have seen in years.  There's not one surprise, but there are a lot of boring moments broken up with bad dialog.  From this time forward, I'm going to read the one star reviews before I pay to stream the video.",1404086400,2,567,4.403846153846154
8494989,1,B0068TRTO2,"Lame,lame,lame oh, did I say lame?
Lame pretty much sums this up. I am sure some will disagree. But, for me, this is just lame.",1369785600,4,127,4.12
8494990,1,B0068TRTO2,"This was the worst documentary we've ever watched. It was so amature and fake, we just rolled our eyes the entire movie. Don't waste your money.",1346889600,5,144,4.576923076923077
8494991,1,B0068TRTO2,"Don't waste your time with this one.  It is an hour and a half of darkness with an occasional
flash of one of the students.  Just a lot of voices in the dark with every other word a four letter word.  Nothing paranormal about this movie.  What a set up.  As for the students, wouldn't want any of them in any of my classes.  Overacted with no point to the movie.",1336435200,5,362,4.028169014084507
8494992,1,B0068TRTO2,"The storyline was not researched, the acting was that of a kindergarden play with the dialogue of a poorly run house of corrections, however the 9 year old operating the camera did quite an impressive job for his age. My favorite part was when the 'senior year college students' were doing their reseach on camera as if to tell the audience: Look, we CAN read. Don't waste your time.",1326672000,7,383,4.565217391304348
8494993,1,B0068TRTO2,"Don't waste your time or money. The whole ""documentary"" was a waste of time. The only thing scary was the acting or lack there of. Alot of cussing and yelling about nothing. Horrible! I will definitely be asking for a full refund.",1325462400,8,230,4.5
8494994,1,B0068TRTO2,"Now it's ""private"" and the author of the FAQ is putting links to the Amazon page on other movies on IMDB claiming either he finds it enjoyable and well done, or he wants to get it banned because of the ""real"" footage and ""yuck"" join him in standing against it.

In any case, asking $19.99 for an unreleased burn-on-demand movie from an unknown director is a bit much, and insinuating (falsely) that there is real footage of dead kids to get people to buy it is just sad.",1321747200,7,470,4.340909090909091
