2245339,5,B0007V6IW6,"About time this finally had a release date. I mean seriously, how hard is it to burn some episodes on a dvd, slap some new music and print it into a box? You would think they would roll this stuff quicker to make way for other shows but nnooooo. Someone at Sony Pics. has to take his/her sweet loving time on these things. Can't wait until Jan 2006 for season 6!",1109548800,6,362,4.112676056338028
2245340,5,B0007V6IW6,"I know there are many disappointed fans out there when it comes to the decline of momentum in the fifth season, but I really loved this season. We have already seen all of Capeside and its inhabitants at this point. We already know the in depth history of each and every one of the main characters. We have already seen the same people thrown into the same situations again and again (Not saying that I didn't love every minute of it). It is just nice to see how they react to a new environment and new people. Also, the fifth season has some of the most heartbreaking storylines of the entire series, including the episode where Mitch dies and the one where Joey gets mugged. For anyone questioning whether or not to buy the disc set, let me just tell you that the previous four were well worth it for me. I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed by the change in music. I understand why certain songs had to be changed, but it just isn't quite the same when you see the opening credits come on and you don't hear ""I don't want to wait"" by Paula Cole along with it. I would certainly pay a little more for the set if it had at least that one song included.",1109376000,7,1163,4.173333333333333
2245341,5,B0007V6IW6,"I know alot of people look back at the fifth and sixth season of Dawson's Creek and frown. But I am not one of them.

To me everything needs to evolve. In season five, Joey is at Worthington with Jen and Jack who are at Boston Bay. All three of them are in Boston along with Gram's and unknowingly Pacey.

Dawson is in California where he is interning as on the set of a movie called Damage INC. directed by a real jerk, Todd. Who fires Dawson on the first day. This sets Season 5 into motion.

With his movie making dreams suffering a severe blow, Dawson goes back to the east coast to find Joey. What he doesn't know is that Joey has come to the conclusion that it was baest for them to move on, and she tells Dawson this on his answering machine. When Joey sees Dawson she thinks that he has come from LA after hearing the message, when in fact he did not.

This creates a huge problem for Joey as she wants Dawson to stay, and in the end he does. But when he tells his parents that he is not going back to USC tragedy strickes. One of the most beloved characters on the show dies in a car crash, Dawson's father Mitch. The entire gangcomes to console Dawson, but have little impact.

Deep down Dawson blames Joey for the Death of his father, and this comes to a boil in further episodes.

Other quirks of the fifth season are Jen and Charlie(Chad Micheal Murray from Gilmore Girls, and One Tree Hill). Jack and the Sigma Eps. Pacey finding his true calling in the culinary arts. And Joey's near death experience that makes her want to mend up the damaed fence between her and her father.

All in all one of the better seasons of Dawson's Creek. IIn my Opinion.",1109030400,9,1664,4.230283911671925

Chad Micheal Murray, who plays the jerk Charlie (who you hate him...but you can't help but love him!)Jack joins a frat, joey deals with college boys, professors, and old loves.

2245378,3,B0007V6IW6,"I am going to copy and paste this in every season of Dawson's Creek. Understand I am a fan of 90210 the originals series, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, NCIS, The 100, Utopia, Bones, Continuum just to name a few. I ordered all 6 seasons of Dawson's Creek and began watching them. I understand this is an old T.V. series and I am playing catch up, but there is a reason I have never heard of this show. Pros I enjoy watching shows with the ins and outs of growing up and all the pain it brings, this show does that to a certain extent. The show also brings into light some of the pains homosexual kids face when growing up. Now for the Cons. At best this show was nothing more than a copy cat of 90210 as a matter of fact 90210 was actually mentioned in the show. You will also notice that you can skip a season or two and never truly miss anything.  You know when you sit down and start watching a bad movie but you force yourself through it hoping that it gets good soon ""I found myself in this very situation on more then one occasion"". The love triangle between the three main characters killed the series for me, much like the first couple of seasons of the Vampire Diaries. However, the Vampire Diaries had a story behind each show outside of the love triangle that somewhat held it together. The story line always came second to the love triangle in Dawson's Creek and for the most part the story lines were garbage. Some more bad news for the show; you would be hard pressed to find one 15 year old in high school with a vocabulary of a 30 year old English professor, but not in this show they all do. If it weren't for the last season 2 stars at best.  I recommend this series only if you have time to waste.",1425081600,,1717,4.2

2245398,4,B0007V6IW6,"I rather enjoyed this season where the main characters are out of high school and starting to live their lives.  But this is Dawson's Creek so things are never so easy.  This is a mostly enjoyable season, though the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is due to how the death of Dawson's father was handled.  We see Dawson attempting therapy but we never find out how that went.  So that seemed somewhat unrealistic to me.  All in all, though, a great season.",1399075200,,461,4.313953488372093
2245399,5,B0007V6IW6,"Dawson's Creek is an all time favorite of mine. I make it a routine to re-watch each season at least once a year. It's full of humor, love, heartache, the joy of good friends and fun and just enough drama to keep it suspenseful and beyond entertaining. The acting is great despite it being a teen soap-type show. If you are looking for something different to watch, give Dawson's a try.",1392681600,,386,4.450704225352113
2245400,1,B0007V6IW6,"I cannot believe any fan of this show would rate this season highly. I have a serious question to pose. Have the writers of season 5 seen the previous 2 seasons of this show? I am going to go with no because this season makes absolutely no sense. I also wonder if the writers have any insight what so ever into human nature. People do not go from madly in love with each other to completely indifferent to each other over the course of a few months (not even teenagers). I am of course referring to Pacey and Joey. It REALLY makes no sense for Pacey to go out with Audrey and REALLY REALLY makes no sense for Joey to encourage Pacey and Audrey to go out. The most troubling thing is that throughout this season Pacey and Joey act like they never had feelings for each other.

If you are viewing DC for the first time, please do yourself a favor and just go straight from season 4 to the last half of season 6. Watching season 5 will probably just make you confused, angry or both.",1389830400,4,980,4.212765957446808

2245403,3,B0007V6IW6,"Finally watched this show, Season 1-5, thanks to being home on extended maternity leave. The only reason I kept watching was because of the love-triangle aspect between Joey & Dawson and Joey & Pacey. Didnt love it, but didn't hate it. Favorite episodes when Mitch dies in Season 4.... I cried like my 3 month old baby. And when Pacey chews off Joey's head and dumps her at the prom. Really enjoyed his acting in that scene...such a jerk. But for the most part, very teeny bopper, except for the advanced vocabulary skills all the kids have.  FYI, the  ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" Series, is great. Go watch that when your done with Dawson's-Teenage-Angst-Soapy Creek.",1383436800,,666,4.782608695652174
2245404,5,B0007V6IW6,"Great series. Nutty, fun banter. Tear jerking at times is well done. I got hooked & wished the series didn't end. Dawson was too personally easy to identify with(boring & all talk). The rest of the cast was awesome & fun.",1375315200,,221,4.414634146341464

2245406,4,B0007V6IW6,"I have really enjoyed watching the Dawson Creek saga.  Season 5 I think the writers lost there zest for the show.  The first several episodes were so slow moving they put me t sleep.  There are a couple of good episodes -I guess the writers awakened from their sleep.  I have several more episodes to watch.  I am confident that the writer funk will have passed and the shows get better.  The story line on most episodes are very good and have a good lesson for those who are interested in learning.

2245424,4,B0007V6IW6,"I came to the conclusion that Dawson's Creek should of been named Joey's Creek instead quite some time ago. It seems like in the last few seasons their focus shifted from Dawson's story to Joey's which in my opinion was much more interesting. The never ending drama between Dawson and Joey continues this season but we get to see both of them focus on different areas of their lives. The whole gang has moved on to bigger better things this season like college, film school but with the exception of Dawson they basically all end up within walking distance of each other although they attend different schools. Jack explores the jock life and joins a fraternity and becomes the typically portrayed frat brother trying to fit in with a group he actually doesn't fit in with at all. Dawson and Jen find romance with each other once again and Dawson looses his virginity! At the beginning of season 5 we meet Audrey, Joey's outspoken roommate that brings a much needed comedic personality to the group. Later in the season Audrey and Pacey hit it off after denying their feelings for one another. Joey experiences feelings for one of her professors and later experiences feelings for a former beau of Jens. Overall this is a great season. All of the characters are growing up and moving on to bigger better things.",1358899200,,1311,4.7043478260869565

2245427,3,B0007V6IW6,"Season five is just all over the board, im on disc #4 as of last nite  (yes this review is not done) and there is nothing exciting going on, i watched 6 episodes and i laughed out loud maybee 3 times, the rest of it was garbage.
Spoiler alert:  Jacks a idiot, Jens a idiot, dawsons still harboring a cry-baby whoo-is-me mentality, Grams who is the Christian anchor starts dating a black man (in some denominations is frowned upon) so it doesnt add up. Pacey is still hands down the most realistic,with Audrey a close second and Joey.. We may as well start calling Dawsons Creek *Joeys Creek* this season five is mostly about her, thats not to say this is a bad thing. AND the episode downtown crossing was brilliant.. I loved it.. everything about season five is bland and pretty played out about mid season and this episode sparked some real thought and tension. I completely see and understand other viewers comments and opinions saying season five is garbage and the show doesnt come back alive till mid way through season six.. Im so tempted to just skip a bunch of this drab, but i know there are plot points being made that will make the world right in season six..  ugg  im just ready for season 5 to be over..  only my will power to watch the entire full series keeps me faithfull..  thank goodness i bought season 5 used on amazon for like #12.00  To be continued when i finish the season.  I want to add that i think its sad, they could have written season five so much better, its the first season away from capeside and a chance to realy pump up the temp and the stakes of the show.. it feels like a half effort in my opinion.  To be Continued...

UPDATE: I finished season 5 last night, and yeah, its garbage.. ugg what a waste of my time !  I started season 6 last nite as well and im upset, WHY ? Becouse its season six and its hardly any different than season 5 a few episodes into it.. i sure hope other reviewers are right when they say the show comes back alive mid seson 6.

2245432,4,B0007V6IW6,"College life is presented as being rather dull here, even with the dorms and some new faces.  This makes some of the episodes drag on in a tiresome fashion.
Otherwise, the hilarious Busy Phillips is a great addition as Pacey's girlfriend Audrey, while Jordan Bridges is very watchable and animated as Dawson's filmmaking partner Oliver.  Jen doesn't do a whole lot this time besides spin records, hang out with Jack, and deal poorly with Dawson.  And the Joey-and-Dawson show continues on its twisted way.  There is a great episode, though, called ""Downtown Crossing,"" in which Joey is faced with a mugger who is then run over.  It's quite emotional but not terribly sappy.
  Jack is the biggest disappointment here, shooting pool and drinking instead of studying.  (In fact...when does anyone in this college ever study? And how do they do on their tests?  This isn't addressed clearly.)
  This season is okay as a bridge to the next one, but it's just okay as a standalone.",1244937600,,975,4.848484848484849

2245444,1,B0007V6IW6,"So now we're not only losing the original music, but much loved scenes as well? Is there any effort going into these DVDs at all? My favourite scene in this season - the one where Jen is debating going on a trip to Costa Rica with Jack or to spend the summer with her parents - was completely ruined by a change in music. The original, ""Teenage Wasteland"" by the Who, was switched out for an upbeat song that did not convey the mood of the scene at all. Yes she was dancing on a chair, but Jen was dealing with angst over a dilemma, not having a pajama party! Then of course the scene where Joey's singing with Charlie's band. Again we can see that the studios just do not care that they're butchering a much loved show. I understand it can be expensive to gain the rights to music, but if it can be done for other shows then why not this one? There is little to no difference in cost between these DVDs and those for other shows. This is just disappointing.",1239148800,,958,4.183783783783784
2245445,5,B0007V6IW6,I watched this show when it first came on but it got a little too soapy for me. But watching it as an adult has been a real eye opener. I can relate to everything and you really feel like you're coming of age with the characters. Season 5 is unblelievable (Congrajulations Dawson)but you have to start the series from the begining to get the full effect.,1231372800,,354,4.298507462686567

The gang have gone their separate ways but ultimately will all find their way back through the tragic death of Dawson's father. Joey is more independent as she starts College but she still finds a couple of losers to date, poor Joey. Dawson is pretty depressing this season, it's both a good and a bad thing.

2245448,4,B0007V6IW6,"After a average fourth season which quickly became dull after the never ending battles to win Joey's affection (Dawson and Pacey), Season 5 of Dawson's Creek was bound to be a breath of fresh air. The characters left Capeside to go to college in California and Boston, and the Joey-Dawson-Pacey problems were finally resolved. The truth is, after reading one too many reviews on how mediocre this Fifth season was, I was definitely reluctant to but it. What I found after watching the first few episodes, was that the Fifth season turned out to be my favourite season in a very long time. Dawson's Creek definitely dried out in Seasons 3 and 4, with random unnecessary character additions and the same old conflict going on and on, which eventually dragged out over the entire season. Season 5 is refreshing. The characters have definitely matured and became more fun to watch. Every character had a story going on which became interesting to watch as the season progressed. The season finale was definitely one of the highlights as you cannot wait to see what happens in the following final season. Of course with every good season, it has its downers.

There are some episodes which have ""unbelievable"" story lines and ones that you don't care for a whole lot, but the good outweighs the bad in this situation.

THE DVD SET:

The music used in the original airings of the show have basically all been deleted for new, possibly less exciting music. Some scenes have been deleted too (only for music rights) involving Joey and Audrey singing live on stage. The DVD picture quality is not anything spectacular, as it often appears grainy and blurry at times. But on my version of the season, they spread all 23 episodes out on to 6 discs, instead of the American version with only 4 discs, which has to be a bit better for the quality.

There are absolutely NO extras to be found on this set, which is a major disappointment because these have some very important episodes which deserve at least one audio commentary! This season is all about change after all! A little background info would be nice.

Overall, despite the disappointing extras snub, the episodes are entertaining and definitely rejuvenate the show, especially after a somewhat boring fourth season. The reason why this season is so appealing to me is because the characters are much more likable, they have a sense of humor this time around and are not afraid to try something new.",1172448000,,2447,4.775413711583925

Second, most of the original music has been taken out and replace with bland songs that don't always fit. Thirdly, episode 17 is actually missing scenes because Katie Holmes sings songs that apparently they couldn't secure the rights to and episode 11 has had the song being sung by the actress switched. Fourthly, all 22 episodes are squished onto 4 disks instead of the standard 6. I wouldn't complain so much, but they were able to let the first season to make it to DVD in almost the same way it air and Buffy the Vampire Slayer managed to keep all of its original music and scenes and is separated out onto 6 disks so there isn't a loss of video quality.",1165795200,,834,4.352564102564102
2245450,2,B0007V6IW6,"The characters were all seperated and it kept the drama and the interesting interaction and dramatic life moments spread out and minimum.

The season was less interesting than the previous, with the exception of some very major moments in Dawson's family. The relationships were less interesting. I mean, Charlie & Joey??? Give me a break.

But the main thing that bugged me was the grasping for straws storytelling and the technical disasters. The writing? First of all. Charlie asks Joey to front his band. Huh? She jumped up on stage one time in a fit of wild inhibition, and in the following episodes, she doesn't sing once. Then she's asked to front his band... she doesn't practice... she just hops up there and knows the songs and has never once worked with the band who's performing before a packed bar. Ridiculous.

Jen (Michelle Williams) bounced around like a jack rabbit for a lot of the season. She is forced to act so corny about Dawson and their relationship it was at times, horribly annoying. This girl must have an identity crisis because she's played so many different personalities in this series, it isn't even funny.

Then there's the writing. So, why is it that all of the people that Dawson, Joey, Pacey & Jen meet... talk the same way they do? With the same sarcasm and pop culture humor. These people are completely random encounters who've never talked to them before... but yet, they talk the same way??

Like, the drug dealing mugger from episode ""Downtown Crossing"". Joey is being held at gunpoint, but she talks to him like he's Pacey annoying her. Meanwhile, the mugger/gunmen is slinging the same, pop culture reference dialogue at her that has been such a fixture with the show. Could the writers not give him another voice? A unique voice? I thought maybe the mugger grew up with them, or was hiding in Dawson's Capeside closet when they were talking.

The same goes for Professor David Wilder. Apparently Pop culture conversation and dialogue is a class that everyone can take.

I guess the show only had one writer.

The ratings plummeted during this season, causing the following season to be the last. I didn't watch the show when it aired, I purchased the DVDs and watched them. There were many times when I felt bad for the actors in the show. Many times they were put in really silly situations and you can obviously see that they had to grin and bare it.

I grew up with this show and I was deeply affected by how they would pick out songs with lyrics that matched the scene that was happening.  The music was a strong focus of mine for this show and to change over most of the catalog was entirely disappointing.  I have also read that they do not intend on ever releasing a collection with all the original music due to legal reasons.  So I have no intention of owning this collection again, which is a shame, since I adored this show.  You can still catch re-runs on TV, though, and I would recommend, if sampling this show, to catch the high school episodes as opposed to the college episodes.  The writing is better in the high school episodes and the characters are more enjoyable, especially Pacey, (my favorite).

If you put as much stock in the music of this show as I have, I would not suggest purchasing these DVD sets.",1151539200,,930,4.4035087719298245

I don't agree, though I recognize that seasons 5 and 6 were not as good at the precedents. Anyway, it's always interesting to find out what happened to the characters after they leave Capeside and have to face new challenges.

When season 4 was over, I was worried about the show and how the creators would manage to keep the characters together, after they all left to college. The solution was good. Jen, Jack and Joey go to a college in Boston. Pacey gets a job at the same city and Dawson, who decided to go to USC, changes his choice, after a tragic accident.

Season 5 surely has its highlights. We are presented to Audrey, the messy roomate of Joey at college, who joins the gang for the last two seasons. Jack decides to join a broterhood, learning not to trust his new ""friends"". Joey becomes more independent and free, learning with Audrey that life can also be fun, and it's not only demanding! On season 5, Dawson finally looses his virginity with his first girlfriend, Jen. I love the season 5 finale, which reminds a romantic comedy, with people arriving and departuring from an airport.

Dawson's Creek is a TV classic, which deserves to be watched several times in your life. Who doesn't like the eternal love triangle Dawson-Joey-Pacey, with great dialogues and drama? I hope SONY/Columbia releases season 6 soon, with lots of extras, please!",1125532800,3,1471,4.6937984496124034

This is certainly the case with Dawson's Creek. I never watched the show when it was on the air until the last few episodes, but I have enjoyed the first four DVD sets and was interested to see how the show changed once the kids left Capeside for college.

As season five begins, we find Dawson at film school in California, Joey at Worthington College in Boston and Jack and Jen close by at Boston Bay College. Pacey, fresh off his summer working on a yacht, is living in a boat in Boston Harbor and as the season begins, only Jen knows he is there.

Things change quickly for everyone as the season gets under way. Dawson realizes that he misses being with Joey and decides he wants to move to Boston to be near her. But the sudden death of his father changes everything, pushing him away from Joey and eventually into a relationship with Jen. Jack quickly joins a fraternity and his brothers soon begin to take priority over school and his high school friends. Pacey realizes that he has a talent for cooking when he gets a job in a restaurant and Joey finds herself attracted to her professor.

James Van Der Beek is again solid as Dawson, though you have a hard time, as in years past, believing that he is the age that he is. The dialogue throughout the series has always been over the top, which is really what makes the show what it is. His emotion at the death of his father, and his need to be there for his mother is heart wrenching at times. He finally confronts his feelings by going to a therapist to sort out his feelings. It is these emotions that lead him to his relationship with Jen, one that ends before the season concludes, but brings back memories for viewers from the original season of the show.

Michelle Williams as Jen really sees a variety of different roles throughout the season. You see her as the girlfriend to Dawson, but as the relationship slowly begins to fade, you see her trying not to hurt his feelings, yet still keep herself somewhat sane. Her friendship with Jack goes from hot to cold to back to hot again and at the end of the season, she is off to spend the summer with her parents.

As Jack, Kerr Smith is again a strong member of the cast. He confronts a lot of emotions when he joins a fraternity and finds out that he is simply being used to fill a quota. Eventually the fact that he is gay leads him to leave the fraternity. While he is there however, he takes to drinking way too much, and falls behind in his schoolwork and also becomes estranged from Jen for a period of time, a relationship that heals by the season's end.

Joshua Jackson's Pacey is the one character of the group that is not in college, but he is living nearby in a friend's boat as the season begins. Eventually he takes a job at a restaurant and finds out that he has a real talent for it and is put in charge of the kitchen when his boss leaves. He also begins a relationship with Audrey (Busy Phillips), Joey's college roomate, a relationship that reminds one of the relationship he had with Joey, something that really makes him happy.

Of course Katie Holmes as Joey Potter was one of the most beautiful women on television at the time and in this season, you get to see her as a college freshman. Her almost affair with a professor and her attraction to a guy who cheated on Jen show a different side to Joey Potter than most people are used to after four years of getting to know her. Perhaps her best episode of the series was the one where she was mugged and helped the mugger after he was hit by a car. This episode featured just this story line and was very powerful.

Busy Phillips, as Audrey, guest starred in almost every episode and was added as a series regular in t he final season. Mary Beth Piel's Grams is still a cast regular, as she moves to Boston and houses Jen, Jack and eventually Dawson. She really is a fantastic character, one that provides that motherly advice that young people always need. Mary Margaret Humes, a cast regular for the first four years, appears sporadically as Dawson's mom Gail. John Wesley Shipp also appears in a few episodes as Mitch Leery, before he dies in a car crash. The third former cast regular Nina Repeta, appears in a few episodes as Joey's sister Bessie.

Of course there is the guest star appearances of a couple of people from other shows. Chad Michael Murray is now the star of One Tree Hill. Sherrilyn Fenn was on a number of shows, including Twin Peaks. Phillips was on Freaks and Geeks.

This set could have easily been rated five stars from this reviewer, but there were no extras at all. Each of the other four sets has at least a commentary track or two for the fans, but this set featured nothing, which was disappointing. Also, the theme song is again replaced, which is what viewers have come to expect over the last few seasons. It would be nice if they brought back Paula Cole for season six, but I kind of doubt it will happen.",1120435200,20,5154,4.369519832985386

I realize my obsession with this show is crazy, and yeah we've all got other things to do in life, but I loved sitting down with the past season's dvd's and watching all the commentary. I, like others I'm sure, sat down with their new dvd's when they got them, and after popping it in the dvd player and getting in a really cozy spot, got ready for great new commentaries (which were promised in the last season's commentaries) and familiar shows. But instead we didn't get anything, not even the theme song. I mean, I have to push mute everytime that horrible song comes on. I think for the money we are spending, we should get what we are promised, especially since we're getting jipped out of the great music. I continue to watch the show on TBS just so I can experience that great original feeling you get from watching Dawsons Creek, since I can't get it from my dvd. The shows are great for ""the collection"", and yeah, if you don't have the music memorized, you won't notice the changes, but I really looked forward to those commentaries, they were great and fun and insightful for DC lover's. I just hope someone takes pity on us, the crazed Dawsons Creek fans, and brings back the good stuff for season 6. And on that note, has anyone heard of a release date? I mean how long does it take? Season 5 appeared to be put together in less than a day. Its not like they are having to do reshoot's on them, just slap it on a dvd, and have Paul Stupin say a few word's on a couple of show's.

Personally, I don't like change ~ i would have preferred all the original songs intact ... alas ...  due to Liscensing $$$ issues this is not possible and i suspect Season Six will fall victim to the same Musical Problems.

The list is actually quite long .. i didn't even realize how much was really altered!

""Dawson's Creek: The Complete Fifth Season

As has been the case with releases of earlier seasons, the Season 5 DVD set contains replacement songs from what was heard during the actual broadcast airings.

Two of the scenes with Katie Holmes singing with the band in episode #517 (""Jessie's Girl"" and ""I Ran"") have been deleted from the episode. This was due to licensing issues.

In episode #511, Busy Phillips' rendition of ""Son Of A Preacher Man"" is replaced with an audio track of her song ""Bad Times"" which was seen/heard in the Season 6 episode #612.

The original theme song ""I Don't Want To Wait"" (Paula Cole) will be replaced with ""Run Like Mad"" by Jann Arden. ""Run Like Mad"" was the song heard during the opening credits of the original Season 1 international airings.

The special opening credits music created by DC composer Adam Fields heard in episode #504 (Mitch's death) was replaced with the DVD release theme song.

The special theme song created by DC music composer Adam Fields for episode #515 will remain as originally aired.

Dawson's Creek executive producer Paul Stupin, with collaboration from co-producer Drew Matich, and music supervisor John McCullough, selected the replacement songs""

This is an exact list of all the musical changes that you will find on this DVD set !!!  So you can decide for yourself if it's a big deal or not !! I will try to review all the other seasons if you are interested in other set changes !",1118880000,10,1922,4.675595238095238

But when I think I'm buying Season 5 of ""Dawson's Creek"" and what I really get is some whacked-out EDITED version of the show, I'm gonna be unhappy!  This is the situation.  I dealt with the theme song change.  I dealt with some horrendous replacement songs.  But I shouldn't have to deal with the decision to edit out some scenes for licensing issues.  I hope I speak for many when I say that I am willing to pay top dollar for the unedited, as they aired versions of each and every episode of ""Dawson's Creek"".  The DVDs as they are do not do the show justice.  Only Season 1 is in its original state.  It's the only set I suggest buying.",1115942400,10,718,4.175182481751825
2245476,4,B0007V6IW6,"The fifth season saw alot of change for Dawson, Joey, Pacey, Jen, and Jack, but it also brought a more ""adult"" and loose feeling to the cast that, otherwise, wasn't there in seasons 1-4. Having said that, I feel that this season isn't as strong as other seasons, but it still worth the watch. I definitely think if you skip this season, then you will not get the season six. The reason I said that is because I quit watching Dawson's Creek around the middle of this season. I quit watching not because I thought it wasn't any good at the time, but rather that I was really busy with work and school.

Anyway, this season as I said, brings forth change, but one thing remains is the Joey-Dawson-Pacey love triangle and the Jen and Jack friendship. College really messes these characters up. They find themselves in a new environment with new characters like Audrey (Joey's college roommate), whom I think isn't that great of a character, but does add a nice break from the five.

People can say what they want to about this season. I like it. I know it's not as good as the other seasons, but it does have an interesting feel that the other seasons didn't. Things change and so do people. This is most comfortable I've seen these characters since their early beginnings in Capeside.

That song was chosen in the Tv series especially for that scene, i just don't get it.

Some of the episodes look very grainy and the 100th episode, in the first flashback between Joey and Dawson, they forgot to mix in Dawson's dialogue so you only hear Joey talking, and Dawson's mouth moving, but no sound...all I have to say to Paul Stupin is..wtf? If he cared enough he might have taken the time to do some commentary, perhaps even get the rights to some of the better songs that they played during this season. For instance, the song in ""Downtown Crossing""...the one Joeys dad used to sing to her, they cut out Joey humming the song and they replaced it with some other song. Mary Beth Meziarz is an awesome pianist and singer and they should have tried to keep her in the soundtracks. All we have here is the 23 episodes of the 5th season with music changes.

I'm not sure if the writer just gave up and stopped caring or if he decided to have his apprentice take over, but the show is losing it's level of credibility and quality right about Season 5.  While you will probably respect the Dawson and Jen hook up in Season 5, that will most likely be the only nostalgic and interesting part.  The rest of it is like a broken record that you have heard a thousand times.  Yes, the film is called ""Dawson's Creek"".  Yes, the writer ruins the finale of the show by hooking up Joey and Pacey.  Yes, the writer also messes things up by putting the characters in this ridiculous ""real-life"" setting.  How is giving all of the characters their miraculous dreams considered ""real life""?

By Season 5, the characters are so shallow and the plot is so trivial.

I'm not a fan of Audrey, and I definitely don't like her with Pacey at all, but it was interesting watching Dawson and Jen get back together for a while and explore the sexual energy that was always between them.  This season also contains my favorite episode ever (tied only with the Anti-Prom) of Joey and the mugger...Some people might have found it not fitting with the series, but if you really look at it, Dawson's Creek becomes more and more about Joey throughout the seasons, and she emerges as a strong, complex character so well-played by Katie Holmes.  That episode is really moving.  I also have to say that Jack looks amazing in this season, and some of his interplays with Pacey are hysterical.  In general, I would definitely recommend this season.  None of the other seasons match 3 in my opinion, but this is certainly a must-have for us Dawson's-lovers.

We don't know if Season Five dvd includes any bonus material (I think the answer is going to be: NONE), but we do know that SOME SCENES ARE GONNA BE CUT!!!! (Katie's, when she sings with the band). So, it's not only that they're not giving, but they're also taking. Not to mention that they're changing the songs once again.

So, here's my advice: Unless you're a real fan of DC and wants to own all the seasons, don't buy this, and neither sixth season, unless it may bring some good extras.
I recommend to buy 1-4 seasons, and the series finale.",1113091200,13,800,4.442176870748299
2245496,5,B0007V6IW6,"Ignore the haters, Season Five is one of the series' best. While nothing will touch the freshman year of Seasons One and Two, Season Five benefits from a welcome change of scenery. Capeside was getting tired by the end of Season Three, and Four seemed like the same old conflicts reiterated again. The series needed to breathe, and it found new wind in sending Dawson off to California and the rest of the clan off to Boston.

Throwing the characters into the new realm of post-secondary adds freshness to the series, as the gang is able to experience new and more age-oriented conflicts, like fraternity angst, career-path uncertainty and the perils of being away from home. The series would even stretch itself creatively with the new location change, with an interesting two-parter with Joey and a life-changing situation.

Not only is the change of scenery rife with interesting new experiences, but the actual subject matter of Season Five has much more dramatic weight than the comparatively lackluster Season Four. Dawson does some real soul searching, Pacey copes with the hardships of being a failure, and there is a death with an emotional impact that makes Abby Morgan's farewell in Season Two seems like small stuff.

We also get a new regular, Audrey, ""Freaks and Geeks"" breakout Busy Phillips, and she adds a feistiness to the series that had been lost after Abby's departure in Season Two. While Audrey's character would become a writing snafu in Season Six (constantly reiterating the same old tired drug/alcohol abuse story), her, Joey and Pacey have some really strong moments in this season. Jack's homosexuality is treated much more comfortably here than it was in any other season, and Jen is surprisingly loveable in Season Five, which is nice considering how grating she was becoming with all her angst throughout Seasons Two to Four.

All the characters really do grow in this season, and some of the entire series' best moments can be found within. Joey's sing-song at the bar is a celebration of her newfound individuality apart from Dawson or Pacey, the funeral service for the death victim and a tender moment between Dawson and Jen after nearly breaking up all rank up there in emotional impact with the Season One finale.

Those who badmouth Season Five are mostly, from what I can gather, Joshua Jackson lovers who just can't get past the fact that the series is called ""Dawson's Creek"" and not ""Pacey and Joey's Creek"". Pacey and Joey share some wonderful moments in Seasons Three, Four and Six, but it is nice that they get a breather in Five. Those looking for the Pacey-Joey drama of previous seasons will be stubbornly disappointed, but those looking for a fresh return to the essence of the show will no doubt appreciate Season Five. It is easily the most underappreciated season in the series, and hopefully this DVD release will allow fans to revisit and reappraise this great season. Enjoy it while you can, because Season Six is a rough ride...

Fans should know a couple things about this 5th Season DVD release.  Firstly, the music is again changed, including the Paula Cole theme song.  While this has been common practice for the last couple seasons, this one takes it a step further.  In the funeral episode, which in the series' original run was the only episode to have entirely different music and credits, has instead been replaced with the Jann Arden opening.  The original opening for this episode had a beautifully somber instrumental version of Paula Cole's theme song (performed by Adam Fields) that was set to images of a cloudy Capeside.  It was beautiful, but on this release it is no longer.  A real shame.

Secondly, the other big change on this release compared to the previous ones is the total lack of extras.  The Paul Stupin commentaries that we have all anticipated and loved each year have now been discontinued.  No trivia games, Capeside map, behind-the-scenes interviews, nothing.  Considering Season 5 was such a big change for the series, you'd think they would have had Paul come in and dish out on his creation.  He even spoke of his excitement to do so on the commentary for Season 4.  Alas, we get a couple previews for other shows on disc one, and the rest of the three discs are completely empty.  Season 5 is a great enough season to warrent purchase on its own, but the lack of extras is a real slap in the face to fans who have stuck by this series so long on both TV and now DVD.  Given that it is Sony I can't say that I am all that surprised, but I hope they rectify their mistakes for the final season.  Please, Sony, bring the commentaries back!",1112400000,91,4631,4.7565543071161045
2245497,2,B0007V6IW6,"A Craptacular Season. The worst, in my opinion. Didn't even bother to watch past a few episodes when they first came out. Now that I have finally watched most of them on tbs...I have to say that the writers didn't know what to do with the show at this point, and it showed. I agree with most of these reviews, that in this season, they basically ignored character development from previous seasons, and also seemed to ignore the fact that Pacey and Joey had a relationship at all. You can't ignore significant events, and significant developments of characters personalitys. Well, you can...but what comes out of that is bad tv. I will never spend my money on season 5. I am awaiting season six, because at least it started to improve around the middle of the season.",1112227200,8,767,4.605839416058394
2245498,3,B0007V6IW6,"This was an interesting season.  The first season is pure gold, great writing, stories etc.  The show becomes like a drug after that, season's two and three were also both great for seperate reasons, both capturing the magic and even though it declined throughout the seasons; the smart writing of the show.  Season 4 is also really good, it starts to lose some of its appeal and you can notice some holes in the show but is still more  addicting than crack.

Which brings us to season 5, the writing took a nose dive and the show kind of went all over the place...literally and figuretivly.  It was interesting to watch for a few reasons, one being it was cool to see the charecters we have grown and love leave capeside and live in the 'real world.'  Another being Dawson and Joey, even though by season three you were sick of them and more than happy to welcome Pacey and Joey with open arms, irrationally bringing back the Dawson/Joey saga and incorporating a Dawson/Jen hookup brought the season a nostalgic feel. Those were the positive points, other than that it was great to see them change some things up a bit but they completely just said screw it with the charecter developtment they had worked up for the past four seasons with some of the charecters, such as Jack & Joey.  Joey just randomly hooking up and Jack becoming massive partier.

Over all it is a good season for fans who have followed the show, but the writing suffered, the charecters suffered, and there were a lot of holes in the show, it was good for a teen drama, but as oppossed to the smart self aware show it was when it first waltzed on the WB it was a shell of its former self, however it still was vastly better than the completely ""hurts to watch"" sixth season (with the exception of the serise finale.)

This series dealt with so much that I can relate to, even as a guy (who gets made fun of constantly for liking this show) I can still say that this was the best show on TV!

My biggest disappointment was the Theme music. Not having Paula Cole's song in the beginning is like not having the ""I'll be there for you"" song on when the Friends credits is rolling!

All in all, season 5 is just as good as the rest, its a must!",1111363200,11,557,4.009009009009009
2245500,4,B0007V6IW6,"i don't know about anyone else, but i'm not to fond of how the dvd sets don't contain the original music from when the episodes aired on tv...even the theme song.  music choice can give a whole different feel to what's going on in an episode...  sometimes i'd hear a song on the radio and it would remind me of a memorable scene in dawson's, but when you watch the dvds, you get something else.  they had some really good songs on the original episodes.  does anyone know if there's a reason why they don't include the original songs?  is it for legal reasons maybe?",1111276800,6,566,4.352380952380952

The whole episode where Joey gets mugged just didn't fit in.  The Dawson/Jen story, to me anyway, went too quickly and didn't develop.  And Pacey wasn't around as much, so there went the comic relief.  I, like most others, can't wait for Season 6.",1110931200,5,364,4.625
2245502,2,B0007V6IW6,"season 5 had its good and bad moments. the tragedy in the Leery household was good drama; whereas the episode with Joey getting mugged was w/o question one of the worst moments in TV history. the writers really sucked it up. first off, after two years of Joey/Pacey drama they suddenly acted like they never even dated. the Dawson/Jen hookup was just plain bizarre,disarming and out of nowhere. instead of taking time to develop plot devices they just threw them out there with no justification or rational. poor Pacey also seemed largely absent, literally and figuratively from all things compelling or interesting.

for me, Dawson's Creek jumped shark this season and didn't regain its footing until the second half of season 6. perhaps they should have Mike and the bots from Mystery Science Theater 3000 do the commentary for the mugging episode!",1109894400,11,850,4.985915492957746

Blame executive producer Paul stupin writer Tom Latinos and kevin Williamson for hiring these people because now we are stuck with this forever!!  2 more things is jen and Dawson get back together and then break up for the dumbest reasons I ever herd!!
