4486746,5,B004WJT5FG,"I just finished watching this on Netflix. We were able to adopt our daughter just a couple of weeks agon on National Adoption day so the summary of the story intrigued me. I found the movie very powerful with excellent performances from Florence Henderson and the young actress playing the foster child, Julia.

Julia is 9 and the movie did a very accurate job of showing what would be common occurances leading up to a child entering foster care. Of coure there are a million different details but the basic scenario of a biological unable and/or unwilling to provide even minimal basic safe care for a child is why children enter the foster system. I do strongly disagree with the existing 1 star review at the time of my writing this. The scenes of Julia's previous life are VERY brief. The filmmakers did their best to keep these brief. But they were completely necessary to the movie. And they could be used as a teaching moment for young children watching that will help them better understand any foster or adoptive children in their schools, and life. How come Julia isn't with her mom? What did her mom do? How come Julia is sad?

From my experiences with foster to adopt most things were portrayed accuretly with the exception of the biological mom going over to the foster home for a visit. This would NOT happen for anyone considering foster to adopt. It also somewhat brought up what might be a big mis-conception about fostering; people doing it for pay. Are there some foster only homes for who this is a consideration, yes? Maybe even a big consideration. But there are many homes like we were who are foster to adopt. We WANTED to adopt. Our fist placement did go back to relatives after we had fallen in love with him. But we were lucky enough to adopt our daughter. In the movie they say Michigan pays $15 a day. Texas pays a little over $20. Ask yourself this. These children are in need, it is not safe for them with biological parents and then relatives are asked and are unable or not suitable as well. They need a home. Would a for profit group home charge the state $20 a day to care for a child? Heck no. You are talking probably at least a $100 a day maybe $200 or more. Foster homes across this country save tax payers billions of dollars a year.

Every foster child is different. Our placements were both very much younger so did not have the same problems at all. And obviously for dramatic purposes Julia was portrayed as I would say on the very much more to more than average problem side. However the filmakers did do their homework or had their own experiences because the ways Julia act out are some of the most common that were related to us that we might see with older children. In the end, surprisingly powerful performances, very accurate, and something worth watching to anyone considering fostering, foster to adopt, or adoption. And of course anyone who wants a much better than average holiday movie that IS something younger kids (say 7 or 8 and up) both can and SHOULD watch with parental guidance.",1323475200,8,3044,4.5510948905109485
4486747,4,B004WJT5FG,"In arguably the performance of her life, Florence Henderson (Brady Bunch) stars as an eccentric, rough-around-the-edges farmwoman who nurses bunnies back to health.

A troubled foster child named Julia has been tossed from home to home, largely because she won't speak and obsessively watches an old videotape of The Velveteen Rabbit. Her foster families don't know what to do with her--and Julia's Mom is a drug addict incapable of caring for her.

Enter a loving but fallen-on-hard-times family that includes an out-of-work engineer for a father, a stay-at-home furniture-painting mom and an adolescent boy who have decided to take on a foster child (doing double duty for additional income and filling a void in the mom's heart).

The caseworkers place Julia with the family, but the transition isn't smooth--especially because of Julia's lack of communication and anti-social behavior.

During the holidays, cousins come over and an uncle gets the boy a BB gun. They run out in the woods and start shooting at birds--and end up injuring a bunny. Julia takes to the bunny and the family rush the animal to the vet.

Barring an expensive operation, the bunny has little chance. However, the vet knows a woman who's a ""Bunny Lady""...a rabbit whisperer, if you will. The family goes to the Bunny Lady's farm and get a chilly reception, but she agrees to keep it and try to mend it.

Unbeknownst to her family, Julia gets off at a different bus stop (which worries them): it's at the Bunny Lady's farm. The Bunny Lady allows Julia to visit every day, and she teaches Julia how to care for the rabbits.

When the bratty boys take the healed bunny and decide to put it in one of their ""sleighs"" to push down a steep snow hill they made, Julia screams--and bites one of the boys...and then runs away deep into the forest on a bitterly cold evening.

The rest of the movie shows how a family's love (and a rabbit's!) breaks through to a sad, mistrustful, lonely little girl--and how a grown man learns humility for the sake of his family and how a bitter widow's heart softens towards humanity.

The Christmas Bunny isn't a saccharine holiday tale (despite receiving Five out of Five Doves from the Dove Foundation), and does have a few unsettling moments. Still, it's a redemptive, well-acted movie likely to elicit more than a few tears, as well as feelings of thankfulness for family and community.

4486748,5,B004WJT5FG,"I laughed, I cried.  It is a very touching story but what I liked most is that it covered a lot of information about rabbits.  People could learn a lot from this movie.  The only thing they didn't get right was the picking up rabbits by the scruff.  That is unacceptable.  But it did show how much goes into the care of a rabbit with facts about diet, grooming, habits, etc.  It also brought to light how people treat rabbits like they are disposable.  Adopting a rabbit is a decision people should not make lightly and hopefully this movie makes more people aware of this.  For that reason alone, I give it 5 stars.",1323302400,9,616,4.342105263157895
4486749,5,B004WJT5FG,"I have read through the other reviews and am a bit surprised at some of the comments. This movie was rather true to life . . . as ugly as that can be. I would probably not allow very young children to see this movie, I would have no problem showing it to children that are old enough to understand that some children have lives in which they are removed from their birth family for their safety and future. The movie does portray a drug addicted mom that slaps her daughter and the mom does pass out while a man is beating on the door . . . many children live this type of life each and every day. My three youngest children were rescued from a bad situation . . . we have since adopted them. Many times, as this movie portrays, there is a beautiful ending to the ""story""! This movie provides parents the opportunity to talk to their kids and to teach them drugs are never a good thing, lives aren't perfect, there is sadness all around. They also could learn compassion, love and thinking of others.",1323216000,3,1000,4.268421052631579
4486750,5,B004WJT5FG,what a pleasant surprise to find such a good message movie.  I like how it showed human weaknesses/mistakes and then they would correct/appoligize about their decision(s).,1322352000,,171,5.576923076923077
4486751,5,B004WJT5FG,I love the movie and my favorite parts of the movie were parts with the bunnies hopping around. It really did look like magical place with all the pretty xmas lights in the barn.,1321747200,3,178,4.264705882352941
4486752,3,B004WJT5FG,"I must first get this comment out of the way: Do not ever, EVER pick up a rabbit by the back of his neck! Rabbits have very delicate skin that tears easily. The producers evidently consulted an ""expert"" near the location that they filmed, but this is not recommended by exotics vets or any other good resource that you can find on the web, of which there are many. Every time the rabbits in the movie were grabbed in that way, I died a little inside. (OK maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.)

!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!
Aside from that, the movie was very entertaining and quite sad, but, of course, there was a happy ending. The storyline was good in a family movie kind of way, but some of the subjects that were raised were pretty heavy for a young audience: The little girl's birth mother was a drug user and physically abusive and the foster family father was unemployed and angry. Additionally, the two little boys were cruel to the rabbit without much admonishment from the parents, first shooting it with a bb gun and then later putting him in a stroller on top of a sled and pushing it down a hill.",1321660800,28,1121,4.389423076923077
4486753,5,B004WJT5FG,"This movie is a winner and true to the spirit of the values and way of life in Western Michigan.  The movie has character, charm, VALUES; a touching story line and wonderful acting. Most highly recommended for those who value true worth of home and family but especially the worth of every human being.  The kind and wholesome treatment of our little animal friends is most evident.

This speaks more than ever to the ready need for family values in this time of economic stress and challenge.  Watch it; it's a keeper.!",1321660800,5,520,4.619565217391305
4486754,5,B004WJT5FG,"My 7 year old daughter (who loves bunnies) and I watched this movie and cried the whole time. It was a great bonding experience but it tells you just how sad this movie is. Very charming but sad.

Story: An abused 9 year old Julia (whose mother is a drug addict and an alcoholic) is placed in a new foster family. Foster dad is stressed because he can't find a job. Foster mom is an artist and very loving. Foster brother is  not a bad boy but has no patience for a ""broken foster sister"".
Julia doesn't talk or otherwise engage in family life, she only watches ""Velveteen Rabbit"" movie over and over again. Some flashbacks show her mother coming late at night drunk and stoned (closing a door in some guy's face) and hitting Julia for not sleeping in a bathtub like she was told. So we know that Julia has a broken heart. When the family finds a hurt rabbit in the woods, Julia gets very attached to it. The only person that can help the hurt bunniy is a weird old lady who lives on the farm with hundreds of abandoned animals. She refuses to return the bunny to Julia until the girl learns to take care of it properly. So Julia spends every afternoon after school at the old woman's farm helping with animals, and in the process of healing the bunny she heals her own heart.

It is a great family movie as long as you are prepared to discuss following issues:
1)adoption/foster families
2) mothers abandoning children/not showing up for visitation appointments (it might bring bad memories in families with divorced parents)
3) mother in jail/giving away parental rights
4) drug/alcohol addiction
5) running away from home
6) parents hurting children (it is only a slap on the face in a movie, so it is not graphic at all but when Julia slaps a doll she receives as a gift from the foster family for Christmas it is clear that she is damaged and has lots of anger).

Please don't let this scare you away from this wonderful movie. It's a lovely movie indeed, but it does deal with some adult topics that might or might not go over kids' heads.

It has a happy ending so it will be happy tears.",1320451200,61,2122,4.430769230769231
4486755,4,B004WJT5FG,"The Christmas Bunny -

This movie is both touching and endearing.  I think both Florence
Henderson and Sophie Bolen (Julia, the little girl) put on Emmy-worthy
performances.  The audiences' heart is immediately captured by Julia's
hardship and is carried throughout to a tear-filled ending.  Florence
Henderson shows a side of herself that ""Brady Bunch"" fans will be
fascinated by.  I believe all families, especially in today's tough
economic times, will be able to relate and will be uplifted by the support
Julia receives from those around her.  I hope this movie goes on to become
a regularly seen Christmas staple.",1310256000,25,619,5.14

4486788,5,B004WJT5FG,"Florence Henderson played Betsy Ross aka the Bunny Lady in this independent film. The story is about a foster girl named Julia who bonds with a lost rabbit around Christmastime in Michigan. The film was shot entirely in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. The cast does a terrific job in depicting a story about a young girl bonding with a rabbit and helping the bunny lady.

The Coopers include the parents and a stepbrother Billy. Julia comes to live with the Coopers before Christmas. They spend the holiday at a relative's house where they find the bunny. But Julia was already enthralled with bunnies and rabbits, she brought the novel, ""The Velveteen Rabbit."" When they find the injured bunny, Julia seems taken with it right away.

Tom Seidman did a terrific job in writing and directing the film without the pretentiousness of family films. This film has a lot of cuteness especially with rabbits. The extras featured a vignette on ""The Real Bunny Lady;"" ""The Rabbit House Society;"" and ""Foster Family"" as well. I loved seeing the film. I love rabbits myself. I loved that the DVD takes time to inform audiences about raising rabbits. Rabbits are the third most relinquished animal in nation's animal shelters.",1506124800,,1215,4.893203883495145
4486789,5,B004WJT5FG,"This is a heart touching story of a little girl who has lost her mother to the world of drugs and jail, and she's lost her voice, as she moves into the foster care system.  A family signs up to give her a foster home, and their hearts and lives are impacted as they work out the intricacies of family lie and love and a pet rabbit.  It is well told story, about a bunny they find and adopt at Christmastime, but this moving story of identity and finding what is lost, is good to watch anytime of the year.  Florence Henderson plays a hermit ""Lady of the Rabbits"", and is lovable as she teaches the little girl to care for her rabbit. There are lots of real life situations, tromping through snowy woods for exercise, to gather branches and other natural foods for the rabbits, school bus rides down snowy country roads and other lovely scenes that give this film an authenticity about life in snow country, and the coziness of a loving home. Both for the ""little girl lost"" finding a family and the strong Christian faith of the mother as she helps the little girl, at Christmas and beyond, I highly recommend it.",1493596800,,1113,4.393203883495145

This movie is so adorable and touching on so many levels. A little girl bounced around from foster home to foster home, searching for a family, wanting to be a real person. When fate shines a glimmer of hope, she comes to a family searching too, searching to be whole.

Her velveteen rabbit movie, telling her about being loved, will make her real. When she gets a real rabbit and bonds with it as a vessel for happiness. Then Florence Henderson, ""Mrs Brady"", helps her heal, more than the rabbit.

Never give up on true love, family, understanding, and unity and you too will be REAL!

4486817,3,B004WJT5FG,"Holiday movie about an addict's daughter and her new foster family and the trials and tribulations they go through.  Those old enough to remember ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" will find that story not only referenced by playing a major, though subtle, role in the movie (pay close attention to the ending if you don't catch the meaning before that - you'll be surprised) in a nice counterpoint to the obvious bunny and his story.  Florence Henderson does such a great job on a character possibly so unlike any you've ever seen her play before that you may not recognize her at first, which is the ultimate test of acting, after all - to nmake the audience forget the person and believe in the character.  The movie ultimately resolves happily for the foster family, however SPOILER ALERT:

what struck me most forcibly about the story resolution was the way Henderson's eccentric older lonely bunny lady got kicked to the curb after saving the child's life.  Rather than thanking her, realizing she was ""difficult"" through loneliness but had a good heart, and finding some way to help with her work and include her in the community to the extent she could tolerate, the other characters essentially walked away from her, denigrated her as a whacko (with no value as a human being) and demanded pay for giving her a hand at her farm. None of that fits with the idea of a ""Christmas movie"" showing ""Christmas spirit"" at all.  In the end, the damaged kid gets held to people's hearts, the bad boys who earlier deliberately shot at a clearly tame rabbit and later deliberately used the rabbit in play in a way almost certain to harm the animal were not disciplined,  and the damaged adult who never hurt anyone but helped them gets name called and dismissed.",1484697600,4,1770,4.5678233438485805

4486936,4,B004WJT5FG,"I don't think I would have watched this at first glance, but when Florence Henderson died I looked her up to see what movies popped up on Prime and this one was listed.
I loved Florence Henderson for everything people knew about her (actress, singer - including broadway, writer, cooking and morning show host, Dancing With the Stars contestant 2010 - come on, at 76?!?) and some things people didn't (i.e., family background), so I clicked 'play' and sat back and watched a decent family flick.  It definitely had its weaknesses in the category of morality play but it had valid lessons to be learned regardless.
Florence Henderson was phenomenal, completely submerged in her character.  You almost didn't like her (or recognize her) as the rough batsh*t lady with a good heart buried inside, but that was the point.  An older person in pain helping a younger person in pain even as their respective walls stayed firmly in place.
My opinion of F.H. has just gone up a couple of notches as the breadth of her acting ability is beyond what even I realized.  She lived a great and full life.  I'd like to be able to say that at the end.

4486937,1,B004WJT5FG,"This is a depressing movie that has NOTHING to do with Christmas or the holidays. I did not enjoy watching this movie, and would never watch it again. Also, I watched it with my kids thinking it was a fun little bunny movie...a scene at the beginning where a drug addicted whore slaps her little girl and then appears to overdose is pretty intense and not the holiday vibe I was shooting for.  That said, the acting was well done and the low budget production wasn't distracting.",1480377600,2,479,4.505747126436781
4486938,2,B004WJT5FG,"I'll start with the title. This movie has nothing to do with Christmas. The beginning of the movie just happens to take place on Christmas Eve and Christmas, but that's it. In fact, the only holiday even mentioned in relation to the bunny is Easter, when another little girl is crying that the boys ""shot the Easter bunny!""

I'm not going to lie, the movie is incredibly slow and boring. A decent portion of the movie is spent just watching this little girl sit in a chair either staring at the TV or staring out the window in silence.

The little girl is very broken and desperately needs therapy, but CPS just hands her off to a family with no income instead. And of course, they think that time will magically cure her and don't get her help, either.

As for the bunny advise thoughout the movie (which I guess is really the only point of it...?), it was mostly okay. I was pretty shocked at how they kept picking up the bunny by the scruff of its neck, which is completely inapproperate. Not only can this rip their skin, but rabbits have very fragile spines and this behavior could easily hurt them.

I guess overall, I am just wondering what the point of this movie is? There didn't even seem to be a ""moral of the story"" type of ending. It just sort of ended.",1480204800,,1266,4.351694915254237

4486940,4,B004WJT5FG,"Despite the title, this has little to do with Christmas.  It's a touching family movie.

The story begins when Cooper Family - Scott, Patti and their son Billy - take in a foster child named Julia.

Julia's mom had been quite neglectful and was also involved with drugs.  She'd had custody of Julia taken away several times. Julia had been in and out of many Foster Homes.  Her only comfort, only stability, was a copy of the velveteen rabbit.  Julia was so withdrawn she never spoke, and didn't see herself as a real person.

Julia started to recover when Billy accidentally shot a rabbit with a BB gun, and had the gun taken away for it.  A local, and somewhat crazy, woman - Betsy Ross - nursed the rabbit back to health, and taught Julia how to care for him. Betsy cared for many abandoned rabbits and other animals at her farm.  A bond forms between them, eventually Julia becomes Betsy's helper.

Near the end it's revealed where the rabbit had come from.  A couple had bought it for their son.  The kid had barely payed attention to rabbit, never named him, and feed him candy.  Finally the kid's Dad had thought a Domestic Rabbit would be better off in the wild than with them, and left him there.  Then the kid and his mom showed up demanding to have him back.  They'd abandoned a pet, and thought they still owned him?!  Julia refused to give him back, and the Coopers agreed with her.

At the finale the Coopers invite Julia to stay with them permanently.  A very touching scene, that finally gives Julia the home she'd needed.",1479772800,,1538,4.471223021582734

4486991,5,B004WJT5FG,I just saw this move on Cable on my on demand on the UP Station. It's a Powerful Christmas Movie for the little girl Julia who gets adopted and takes care of the injured bunny and keeps it as her own when the original owners try to get it back. It has a lot of happy times and a few sad times too but it has a happy ending. Julia feels lost being in an adopted home and the bunny makes her out of her shell and she warms up with her adopted family because of the bunny with a help from there neighbor who takes care of the stray bunnies. The lady tells Julia that she can keep the bunny who got injured because the neighbor was going to keep it but had a heart to have Julia keep the bunny ( even though the neighbor isn't that nice.) I'm glad that it has a happy ending at the end of this movie and I'm glad to own this movie on dvd.:) Behind the scenes was Awesome and Of Course The Bloopers from that little girl. The little girl had a hard time sitting in the chair and Not Laugh so that was Funny to see because she had a hard time keeping a hard and sad face for that sad scene.,1451692800,,1084,3.8654708520179373

4487028,1,B004WJT5FG,"Talk about yanking a kid around emotionally.
(SPOILERS)

A financially strapped foster family with no source of income is somehow allowed to take in an emotionally disturbed girl with a hopeless drug addict for a mom. The Mother is talking adoption, but Dad refuses to take a job offered by by his brother (or brother-in-law? They don't look related but neither do their wives) because of his stubborn pride.

They find a pet lop eared rabbit in the woods. Well, they don't technically find it, per se- their bratty only child and his juvenile delinquent cousin SHOOT the rabbit with the new BB guns they just got for Christmas. By the way, this is the ONLY thing in the movie that actually has to do with Christmas- they open presents. The rest of the movie takes place after the kids go back to school.

Anyway, the bunny requires expensive surgery to repair the delicate broken bones in its leg. But they don't have money, so the vet sends them to the ""crazy bunny lady"" in hopes that, in her care, the bones will somehow pin themselves into the proper position and knit themselves back together. I might add this is NOT REMOTELY possible. But, anyhoo, they do this. The girl, Julia, gets attached to the crotchety bunny lady and the couple of hundred rabbits she feeds, cares for, has spayed and neutered, and keeps spotlessly clean entirely on her own.

Anyway, fast forward and the bunny is well again. Then the a$$hole son and cousin are at it again, harming the bunny. At this point they're both going to grow up to be serial killers. You have to wonder if these parents should even have foster kids. They're doing a terrible job with the one they have.
At any rate, the girl retaliates and bites their son. Good. He deserved it. Later, she hears the dad ranting about how she's dangerous, the rabbit is a nuisance, and they both have to go. This is like, her fourth foster home already. So the kid, rather than be separated from her precious bunny, sets out into the freezing cold night, and probably would have died if the crotchety bunny lady hadn't thought of somewhere she might be. She is found there with bunny (who luckily has a fur coat) and the dad is remorseful. He's so remorseful, he agrees to take a job from the hated brother-in-law.

But that's not the end. The bunny's original owner shows up, a spoiled brat kid who treated it so badly it almost died in the first place. Now, here's the kicker: When the dad found the girl in the cold, he promised her she could keep the bunny FOREVER. Now, very soon after that, both parents tell her she must give up the bunny to the boy, because he had it first! And they don't even have any way to prove it belonged to the boy in the first place!!!

Anyway, she simply refuses, and that's the end. No, I'm not kidding. They have to pay off the mom of the little boy just to get rid of them.
Wait- that's not quite the end. You see, druggie mom has decided from jail that she doesn't want the kid anymore, so the family decides to adopt the girl- on the condition she doesn't bite! Her response? ""I want my Mommy!"" No joke, kid.

The true star of the film is Florence Henderson. Her portrayal of the eccentric (and, dare I say,scary) bunny lady makes the film. She is convincing as a lonely farmer who has withdrawn into her world of animals. A truly amazing performance.

4487072,1,B004WJT5FG,"I don't understand how this can be called a Christmas movie. Just because there was one scene where the family had dinner and opened presents? This movie was very sad and heartbreaking in many ways. The husband is unemployed and unable to get a job (even though his brother keeps offering him a job which he keeps refusing), so they take in a foster child because he wants that check (but the wife claims that she just wants a second child - they have a little boy). The husband is depressed, and the wife tells him that ""the Lord will provide"" but the husband puts it down, acting like he doesn't believe in God. The nine year old foster child (Julia) is so traumatized by her abusive mother that she has become mute. There are scenes where she remembers her drug-addicted prostitute mother coming home (where she was left alone) and slapping her for ""not sleeping in the bathtub as you were told"" and then she passes out in her hooker outfit while a john bangs on the door demanding to be let in, and Julia cries and cannot wake her up and so watches The Velveteen Rabbit movie over and over to calm herself. At the family dinner, everyone holds hands and prays, but Julia refuses to join in the prayers and no one seems to mind. Julia is given a gift, which she refuses to open. The wife opens the gift for her, and it is a beautiful expensive doll. The wife has to force Julia to accept the gift, so Julia walks up to the doll and slaps it really hard and runs out of the house crying. Everyone gasps because it is obvious that Julia is acting out her own abuse. The two little boys are given bb guns as gifts, so they immediately go outside to shoot them, and they accidentally shoot a rabbit, so they run back to the house crying over it. Julia is more upset than anyone, because she has been obsessed with The Velveteen Rabbit movie. Because Julia is so upset, they put the rabbit into a cardboard box and take him to a vet, who tells them that the rabbit needs care which costs up to $1,000 or else the rabbit must be put to sleep. Because they are worried about Julia's attachment to the rabbit, they want to do something, but they can't afford it. The vet recommends a woman in the neighborhood who cares for rabbits, so they drive over there and leave the rabbit with this crazy hermit lady. Later, Julia just gets off of the school bus to see the Bunny Lady and get her rabbit back, and the wife thinks that she has run away. Inside of the lady's house, we see a houseful of rabbits, which she says that she got because children kept giving them with her because they would get them as gifts for birthdays and easters and then did not want them and couldn't care for them and so all of these rabbits were abandoned to her. At one point, the original owner of the rabbit shows up (a little boy and his mother), wanting the rabbit back, admitting that they never even named their pet and didn't take care of him, feeding him poorly and allowing him to run away. Julia refuses to give the rabbit back and the husband throws them out. Later, the two little boys are playing outside, and they put the rabbit into a baby carriage on a sled and shove it down into the snow. Julia sees this through her window, runs outside, and bites the little boy. The husband and wife get angry at Julia for biting the boy, but they do not get angry at the two little boys for trying to kill this rabbit for the second time. Later, the husband and wife are arguing about how they cannot keep Julia because of all of this drama. Julia hears their very loud arguing, and she runs out of the house, running away into the woods at night in sub-zero snow. When they discover that she is gone, they have to get a rescue team to find her, just in time, before she dies from the cold weather. Then the husband and wife suddenly decide that they want to adopt Julia (and her rabbit), and the husband decides that he will take his brother's job offer after all, and there is a very quick wrapped up happy ending, just like that.  With a title of ""Christmas Bunny"" you would expect an enchanted holiday family inspiring movie, but instead, there is animal cruelty, a depressed family, a mute abused child, two heartless little boys, a crazy hermit lady, surrounded by crying and arguing, followed with a one-minute unbelievable happy ending that comes out of nowhere.",1418774400,6,4347,4.360049321824907

4487075,5,B004WJT5FG,"This is a great movie about foster care, adoption and rabbits! As an adoptive mom of a former foster kid, this movie hits home in many ways. It doesn't really gloss over the difficulties for kids in foster care.  There are some things that aren't exactly true to life but for the most part, it is accurate. In addition to being an adoptive mom, I am also mom to 6 rabbits and I love the way this movie shows what wonderful pets they are. The only issue is that they pick the buns up by the scruff of the neck which should not be done as the buns could struggle and their backs are very easily broken. But, they do highlight that rabbits need companionship and can live well in the home with us if you bunny proof. We just love this flick!",1418083200,,738,4.160839160839161

I think it is the very best movie I have ever seen and have watched it several times with family members since it came.

Also, I have a grand daughter who the little girl reminds me so much of. That child is truly talented.",1390780800,,432,4.280487804878049
4487094,5,B004WJT5FG,I saw this on cable television and was so impressed.  It must have been around for years but never shown on the stations I usually watch.  It struck me as being very ideal for the entire family.  I got one copy for me and one for a relative who has 4  grandchildren.  It has been given a number of well-deserved awards.  It is a good movie for adults or a family with children.,1390435200,,377,4.095890410958904

4487096,5,B004WJT5FG,We loved this bittersweet story. It was well written and was very real to how life truly is. Florence Henderson shone through as did most of the actors. The girl that played the lead was perfectly cast. Worth watching. A new Holiday tradition for our family.,1388620800,,258,4.630434782608695
4487097,4,B004WJT5FG,"It is a wonderful story. I just wish for once there didn't have to be a trauma somewhere in the story line. I would have preferred to see more of the bunny and less of the people, but that is my preference in real life as well!",1385424000,,227,3.851063829787234

4487099,5,B004WJT5FG,"The best thing about this movie is Florence Henderson who turns in a bravura performance as the cranky Rabbit Lady. Her ability to convey loneliness, sadness and slowly growing affection are first rate. The rest of the cast is very good and the tension at various points is real -- for once, you're not sure exactly what is going to happen. Unlike a lot of movies, it treats issues like the father's unemployment and its affect on the rest of the family very seriously and respectfully, so that we see how his pain affects the little girl as well as his wife. Similarly, it takes the issue of rabbits discarded after the holidays and quietly shows how negligent adults and their children have created a real problem. I hope this becomes a popular movie as it is well worth watching -- even if you don't love bunnies.",1365897600,,816,4.557823129251701

4487133,4,B004WJT5FG,"Firstly, I have house rabbits. They are the third most popular pet in the USA. I have become rabbit responsible and researched rabbit care. They are an exotic and this needs to be done before you take on a pet any pet.
Like other people a passion sparks the collections. If one likes cats you sometimes collect cat items. My passion is rabbits. I collect rabbit things...like movies. The Christmas Bunny is a good story. I see some flaws...a few things I resent. First the make someone who loves rabbits appear to be a freak or a crazy rabbit person. That is not true. I also see that the boy characters in the movie do something that compromises the safety of the rabbit...AND they are not punished for it or even put straight on what they did and why it was wrong.
Overall a good story and a must have for the rabbit caregiver to own for fun.",1359417600,,844,4.348101265822785
4487134,5,B004WJT5FG,This was a really sweet movie about the adoption of a very hurt little girl and how helping take care of some rabbits at a nearby farm kind of brought her out of herself and helped her to focus on something besides her own pain. She ends up being adopted by her foster family after they finally win her trust. A great family movie and good acting to boot.,1358553600,,355,4.159420289855072
4487135,5,B004WJT5FG,"Although the bunny on the DVD cover looks nothing like the main bunny in the film, the story reveals the variety and habits of bunnies in a remarkable way.  Even deeper are the challenges of needing breakthroughs in looking for a job, standing in faith and hoping for love.  The parallel story of The Velveteen Rabbit video of becoming real through being loved is seen countless times by the forlorn little girl.  This, by the way, is her film debut.  The other characters are well-cast, too, and the film shows beautiful winter scenes in Western Michigan.

Most amazing is the formerly glamorous Florence Henderson who transforms herself into a crotchety, non-social old bunny lady.  Clearly this could be her signature significant role.  The story could be real and everyone I've shown it to was touched though young children won't grasp some issues.  This slow-moving, subtle story is about relationships and how hope, faith and love can change lives. See it.",1356739200,2,962,4.96875
4487136,5,B004WJT5FG,I love love love rabbits. I have two so I will buy anything rabbit related especially a movie. The story about adoption was great for the whole family. I cried at the end.

4487139,5,B004WJT5FG,"Originally we had rented the Christmas Bunny at our local video store. My daughter (3 years old) loved the movie and cried when we had to return it. I gave in to her tears and searched Amazon for the DVD. We are not big movie watchers, but my daughter requests to watch the movie almost every night! She loves the part when the little girl goes to work with Mrs. Ross helping her care for the bunnies. My daughter shouts- look at all of those bunnies- they are all different colors! I would recommend the Christmas Bunny to anyone that has children-",1347494400,2,549,4.392156862745098
4487140,5,B004WJT5FG,I watched this movie today on Netflix and fell in love. I'm going to buy this one for sure. I felt sorry for the sweet little girl knowing there are so many children out there in those conditions. I'm so glad she found an animal (bun bun) to bring her out of her shell. I also love they had Florence as the rescue lady. I love helping wildlife and animal rescues as well as human charities. This was a well rounded little movie but I wanted to beat up the brother and his friend! She took care of that though! :) I highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting a feel good movie.,1346716800,,580,4.1415929203539825

4487144,4,B004WJT5FG,"Nice movie about taking care of rabbits and what family is about.  A little girl in a foster home finds out that family isn't necessarily your birth parents.  She finds friendship in nurturing a rabbit, probably because she missed the nuturing from her own birth mother.

I only gave it 4 stars because they pick the rabbits up by their scruff every time they handle one.  That is NOT the way to pick up a rabbit.  It is mean and unneccesary.",1327363200,,442,4.407407407407407
4487145,5,B004WJT5FG,"I am a rabbit breeder and I was very impressed with the facts, about rabbits, that were mentioned in this movie.  I was also impressed with Florence Henderson's character.  The film's creators didn't make her seem like a ""crazy bunny lady"" and I was half-expecting them to do so.  The character was human and very likeable as the viewer got to know her.  Florence Henderson played the character wonderfully and I will always consider her a terrific actress.  I enjoyed the performance by the little girl and by the mother of the family.  The emphasis on her spirituality was refreshing and made for a heart-warming story.  I have highly recommended this movie to several of my friends and family.  So far, everyone I recommended it to has said they thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I love bunnies...they are my passion.  I feel this movie was well made and very factual about the care of rabbits.",1324857600,2,893,4.740259740259741
4487146,5,B004WJT5FG,"I accidentally found this movie yesterday after it had started.  I loved it!  I have a grand daughter who was diagnosed with Selective Mutism, she couldn't talk in most situations because of a very difficult childhood.  And Sophie looks like her.  So I connected immediately to this little girl.  I thought the movie was great, close to real life in many people's lives.  As far as the boys go, when I was that age my brothers and cousin and I went shooting birds in the woods with a BB gun. We really just wanted to see if we could hit something, and learned a hard lesson that day, we hit a bird and then we all felt very sad and guilty.  We found it, brought it back home and tried to save it. There is no explaining the things kids do , they just do them, and sometimes the punishment is the memory of it, forever.  Anyway the story is about this little girl and her journey away from her abusive and damaging life, being helped by people who are also struggling.  I think it is an incredible story about life.  I am buying it.  I am not sure if I should watch it with my grand daughter.  She is still having a tough time, but improving all the time. I don't know if she would be better off or worse off by watching this movie. Does anyone have an opinion on this?  I am better off.  It reminds me that your life doesn't have to be perfect for you to be a positive force in someone's life.  And in fact none of our lives are perfect, or even close.",1324771200,5,1452,4.135714285714286
4487147,5,B004WJT5FG,"If you have or ever had a bunny or simply ""love"" bunnies, then you are going to love this movie.  To me, the key element of the movie is how a young girl's love for a bunny brings her out of her shell.  She obviously has had several mistrusting events dealing with humans in her young life; but immediately takes to the bunny as she sees a bunny in need of love and caring much the same as she does.  An immediate respect and bonding develops.
Bunnies and most other domestic animals have a way of reaching inside of us that most humans can't. Bunnies want attention , and as my bunny mentor has told me many times, the more you give them the more they want. We can all learn something from that advice.
If you loved this movie for the bunny parts, then I suggest reading the book Rabbits:  Gentle Hearts, Valiant Spirts.  A whole series of short ""true"" bunny stories that will warm your hearts and you will discover what a great pet a bunny can be.
Bunnies make wonderful pets--loving, fiesty, curious, quiet, caring--all things you would want in a friend--whether animal or human.
Warm your heart, warm your home.  Adopt a rescue bunny!!",1324684800,10,1139,4.451923076923077
4487148,4,B004WJT5FG,"I loved this movie!  I live in Grand Rapids, MI  and it was filmed close to where I live.  Florence Henderson was great and so was Sophie Bolen (the little girl).",1324425600,,162,4.161290322580645
4487149,1,B004WJT5FG,"My wife and I streamed this on Netflix because we love animals so much and figured that with a name like ""The Christmas Bunny"", nothing bad should happen to the animals. The problem in this movie are the 2 brat boys. First they shoot the bunny with a bb gun and then seem all upset about it so they go get their parents. What was their excuse for shooting the bunny? Their excuse was they were looking to shoot squirrels! Why is shooting squirrels OK? Of course, uba-religious mom and somewhat passive dad don't seem to care that they were hunting squirrels. I guess the mom figured that God hates squirrels, so that's ok. But he likes bunnies today, so we better do something. Evidently these 2 brats learn nothing as later in the movie they put the bunny in a baby carriage and throw it down a snow bank. Once again, the parents don't see this as a problem, they only care that the little girl (who adopted the bunny) bit one of the brats because he tried to kill the rabbit twice now.
When all is said and done, there is no tie in to Christmas except that the brats got their bb guns for Christmas gifts and then tried to kill animals for fun. The only saving grace of this movie is Florence Henderson as the Bunny Lady and all of the beautiful bunnies. But basically it shows that hunting squirrels, shooting bunnies, and then torturing them for fun is OK. All this does is put ideas in the heads of other little rotten kids of ways to take part in animal cruelty. The Amazon summary states that the little girl ""discovers an injured rabbit"". This is factually incorrect. She actually adopts a rabbit that her foster brother shot while hunting squirrels. Big difference there.",1324080000,11,1680,4.457792207792208

The caseworker was horrible, the Mom threatening to take the rabbit away because Julia didn't want to put on pajamas, I can go on and on...I've been a foster parent for 4 years and been involved with the system since 2005. This is a HORRIBLE example of what fostering is like. Frankly, Scott and Patty should absolutely NOT be foster parents. The fact that they felt the need to add a line about how, after Julia ran away the foster parents ""did everything exactly right"" was insulting. No, no they didn't. The bunny was great, Julia was a pretty ""typical"" foster kid who needed understanding and love not some heavy-handed BS about ""YOU are the parents, don't coddle her""...",1511654400,,791,4.6571428571428575
