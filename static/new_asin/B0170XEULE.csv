7485944,5,B0170XEULE,This is a very watchable film for westerners.  Most of the comedy is timeless (poking fun at women's lib and the gender wars) but there's also a lot to observe in the background such as Polish culture and 1970/80's sci-fi effects and fashion.  Much of the filming was done at the famous Wieliczka salt mine.  There's a big deal made about the nudity but it's mostly casual and there's no sex either.  Imagine Benny Hill meeting Dark Star.,1111017600,22,438,4.576923076923077

It's a funny little film that I don't think had the biggest budget, but the story itself holds up to time!

There's a communistic/fascist female regime that's trying to maintain control over an all female populace, and throw into that mix two relatively smart men that throw a wrench into the monkey works! Men, being men like to do things their way, and throw them into a society who trying to make them into women and have no concept about what men bring to life, or how women affect men, they are only ever told or shown the one way.

At two hours long I was actually wishing this movie was longer, there is so much to be said or could be said and the guys, being guys, could have done so much more in exploring that all female society. I would have loved to see more of that!",1484092800,2,839,4.198757763975156

8737787,5,B0170XEULE,"One of the funniest movies that I have ever seen, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who experienced or understands the realities of life in soviet-controlled eastern europe.

A warning for all of you Americans interested in Polish comedy:
While some of my American friends find the nudity gratuitous and the plot slightly sexist (mostly due to prude and backwards sentiments in this country), the main problem is that much of the humor is lost on people who don't understand the reality of the times - shortages, arbitrary rules, and control of life by an strange and foreign power. I would recommend the movie Testosterone instead, as it still contains classic Polish humor, without requiring as much understanding of the culture.",1296000000,6,739,5.008130081300813
8737788,5,B0170XEULE,I first saw this movie at the San Francisco Film Festival in the mid-1980s and have been looking for it ever since. The version I bought is good and the subtitles are easy to read (although they are often not on the screen long enough). We just watched the movie and it's as funny as I remembered. A very nice film on many levels.,1260316800,,330,4.171875
8737789,4,B0170XEULE,"SEXMISSION is a very funny science fiction film that incorporates numerous themes from the 1980s.  This movie is in Polish with English subtitles but a non-Polish speaker can easily follow the action not so much because of the translations but because of the ability of the actors to communicate via facial expressions and body language.  The plot brings to mind several earlier films and books that have the theme of a sleeper being placed in suspended animation for a very long time, and the comedy that results with the temporal fish out of water allows the director to poke fun at some otherwise serious social subtexts.  Two money hungry volunteers agree to be placed in stasis for three years to test a longevity device.  One is your basic goofy clown type while the other is the straight man.  Think of a Polish Abbott and Costello duo.  Something goes wrong and they do not awaken until fifty four years later.  They discover that while they were asleep, the entire male gender has died, leaving females to reproduce asexually.  SEXMISSION takes satirical barbs toward women's lib, nudity, the quest for freedom in a totalitarian regime, and communal living in an underground sealed environment.  For a film with an admittedly low budget, SEXMISSION has the feel of a higher budget mostly because of the refusal of the actors to take seriously the shattering implications of their temporal dislocation.  Each one sizes up the situation mostly in terms of realizing that as the only men in a world of women, they have a Hefner libidinous lifestyle guaranteed.  SEXMISSION is a funny romp that nevertheless suggests that the very demons of a hated patriarchy may not be so hated after all and that the need for men and women to live together can never go out of style no matter what kind of gender-killing bomb goes off.",1250899200,3,1826,4.82051282051282
8737790,5,B0170XEULE,"This is one of those futuristic comedies that look great even decades later. Granted, their computers are outdated, technology, communications equipment is ancient, but that's not what this movie is about. It's  a light, romantic comedy with a nice twist and as one it will live on for ages to come.",1206921600,4,299,4.862745098039215
8737791,5,B0170XEULE,"This is the holy grail of Polish cinema. talk to any Polish person and Sex Misje is the movie they will laugh and shout about! There is a reason and for the extra enthusiasm, this movie is best watched with a Polish companion, who can provide intermittent bits of trivia.

This movie, is not only superbly funny, the acting and the direction are superb. Of course, this is not the usual blonde or college flick comedy and it would never please fans of that brand of comedy. This is a serious, good hearted, superbly simple movie and its best seen through the Communist\Polish lens of a long long time ago.",1125446400,13,605,4.5
8737792,1,B0170XEULE,"I wouldn't mind Sexmission's sexist conservative message, if the film would have been better made. The script is idiotic, the acting horrible, the art direction clumsy, the camerawork plain ugly and the sound amateuristic and crappy.

Even that I could stand if it was funny. But the jokes are lame and childish. Not a recommendation.",1118448000,4,334,5.072727272727272
