6564908,5,B00M97DM7A,"By far my favorite interpretation of the greatest monarch in the history of the British Isles.  The characterizations were so well played and Ann Marie Duff was just perfect.  Rather than focus on the decorum of the English Rose, this story focuses on her wit and the power of her many personas as she evolved into a supremely competent ruler.  She showed the world that not only could a woman rule, she could reign.  So many memorable scenes.  Tom Hardy was the best casting choice to soften the strong portrayal of Elizabeth.  The scene where they were dancing, both in real time and in remembrance were so touching.  The laugh after she berated her council for relentless pursuing a ""match""/stud for the succession, was probably my very favorite scene.  I laughed out loud!",1505952000,,776,4.7819548872180455
6564909,3,B00M97DM7A,The music was silly and innapropriate. For just three programs they were well done.  Not my choice for an Elizabeth but not atvall poor.,1505692800,,136,4.666666666666667
6564910,1,B00M97DM7A,"This film is confusing and without interest for failing to show necessary background information. King Henry 8th had six wives, and had children by a couple of them, and had a couple marriages annulled and the wives executed; making succession to the throne confusing for the casual viewer. Succession is very precise; from parent to eldest son; (if no sons to eldest daughter); with other relatives getting involved only if there are no children. Foreign governments or factions within Britain would often claim a certain relative was the heir to the throne as a pretense to seize power. King Henry's only son, Edward, at 10-years-old, succeeded him in a regency, but died after only a 6-year reign. This King Edward left a will denying the throne to his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth, to allow the Protestant, his cousin, Lady Jane Grey to ascend to the throne.

However, upon the death of King Henry's son; Lady Jane Grey (Protestant), age 16, who was King Henry's niece, and who had grown up in the same house as Elizabeth, was made queen for 9-days, while her supporters from Scotland sought to capture and kill King Henry's daughter Mary (Catholic) Elizabeth's half-sister. Lady Jane Grey was overthrown, and was executed, because her father led the effort to kill Mary. Mary (Catholic) was made queen. Mary was 37-years-old when she became queen.

Mary and Elizabeth's much younger cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, ruled in Scotland under a regency until 2-years into the reign of Elizabeth, when Mary became 18 and sole ruler of Scotland, and was married to the King of France. There was a history of Scotland rebelling against English rule or against an oppressive English governor, and a history of the French, England's long-time enemy, plotting with the Scots to land troops in Scotland to invade England. Mary Queen of Scots would be executed by Elizabeth 9-years into Elizabeth's reign.

Elizabeth (Protestant) was Mary Queen of England's half sister by a different mother and was 20-years-old when Mary became queen.

Thus as the film opens; Queen Mary (Catholic) has a legitimate fear of being overthrown & executed, not by Elizabeth, but by Protestants, British factions, the Scots, or foreign governments using Elizabeth as a pretense as they had done previously with Elizabeth's cousin, Lady Jane Grey. The much more interesting movie ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett skips this 5-year period and begins on the day Elizabeth is crowned Queen.

Today; the Catholic church has little or no influence in British or American politics. However, in Elizabeth's day; the Catholic-church was very powerful; effecting succession to the throne or coercing the reigning monarch. Spain and France were predominantly Catholic and were enemies of England. The Catholic Pope resided in Italy. The Catholic-church was wealthy and sometimes corrupt.

King Henry 8th had six wives and many mistresses. The Catholic Pope rebuked King Henry for his immorality. King Henry played the Protestant- church against the Catholic-church in order to continue his immoral lifestyle. King Henry took-over the leadership of the Protestant-church of England, because it had rebuked Henry's immoral lifestyle, and because the Pope was meddling in the affairs of the British government.

When this film begins; Elizabeth is a young 20-years-old and likely innocent of all the political intrigues. Elizabeth's mother was executed by King Henry when Elizabeth was 2-years-old. This film does not let us know whether or not Elizabeth is involved in the plot to overthrow Queen Mary. Elizabeth was investigated for treason and held in the Tower of London for a year. Though there is a tower; the phrase ""Tower of London"" means the entire castle complex; not just the tower portion or the dungeons therein. Elizabeth was detained in a nicely furnished apartment in the Tower of London Castle with the ability to walk within the walls of that castle. Queen Mary was known as ""Bloody Mary"", because she had 300 protestant Christians burned alive at the stake only for their religious beliefs. Queen Mary was also known as ""Bloody Mary"" for executing her sweet, 16-year-old cousin, Lady Jane Grey, who everyone knew was an innocent pawn. Thus, Elizabeth was terrified of her older, half-sister. Elizabeth was young at 25-years-old when she became queen upon the natural death of her half-sister.

This movie should have started briskly with the political-intrigues, battles, personal flights for safety, pursuits, and all, which happened before Elizabeth comes on the scene. A younger actress should have portrayed Elizabeth in episode-1. We should first see Elizabeth in her younger years; though Elizabeth's life was always in peril until the day she became queen. Even then; there were enemies, but then Elizabeth had the power to protect herself.

Not only was Elizabeth's cousin, Lady Jane Grey, executed, but also Lady Jane's husband; thus, no young man would want to marry Elizabeth and suffer the same fate during this 5-years when Elizabeth's fate was in doubt. At age 29; Elizabeth suffered Small-pox, which left scars on her face. The make-up Elizabeth used to cover the scars contained lead, which damaged her skin over time, and caused her hairline to recede.

When Elizabeth's father, King Henry 8th died; his son Edward was 10-years-old, so there was a regency of 12 men, who guided (controlled) Edward during his 6-year rule. During this time young Elizabeth was raised in the home of one of the regents, Thomas Seymour, who immediately sexually molested 14-year-old Elizabeth. This seems apparent in Elizabeth's shaky, distressed, handwriting despite Elizabeth being highly educated. Elizabeth was a rich young woman living in sadness and fear prior to becoming queen. ""Truth is stranger than fiction.""

This film is not interesting for a number of other reasons; even if you know the background. If some film producer would write the truth and write it well; the story of Elizabeth would be an interesting movie, but not this one. The movie, ""Lady Jane"" is a good movie about this time period, but I cannot recommend it, only because of a prolonged nudity scene, which was unnecessary.",1505692800,15,6177,5.148554336989033
6564911,2,B00M97DM7A,"The reign of Elizabeth I is one of the most interesting in history so, naturally I was drawn to this series.  It has a great cast so, I expected to be deeply enthralled by the intrigues of the Elizabethan court.  But alas, it was not to be.  The music in the first episode did nothing to enhance the experience.  In fact it did quite the opposite, it just sounded disjointed and out of place.

I don't know what direction the actors were given but wow, I have never seen Elizabeth I portrayed so ill.  It's as if they decided this multifaceted person was too complex, so they chucked all her redeeming qualities to turn her into a one dimensional character.  She's not alone, Robert Dudley suffers the same fate.  This is one of the most exciting, torrid, forgiving, adult love affairs in history but, none of that is apparent here.  They love and argue equally without passion, I can't tell that they have any chemistry at all. I don't know what they like about each other, it seems to be entirely political and calculated on both their parts.  It's disappointing.

The speech that Elizabeth gives to rouse her forces before the Spanish armada is popular in many adaptions.  It's always the same speech because it's historically accurate and it's awesome.  I didn't think it was possible to make that speech sound parroted.  It was barked and rushed without pause or emphasis.  At this point I just couldn't wait for it to end.

Oh but I will say this - the make-up was good.  There was a lovely vein visible on Elizabeth's temple that really made it seem that like she had aged and her skin was thinning.  Well done to the make-up artist(s).",1505606400,5,1643,4.549488054607509
6564912,3,B00M97DM7A,"I enjoyed watching the series for the most part.  Felt some of it was rushed or they didn't explain it very well, especially the last half of her reign.  Also, felt this was made targeting the the female audience. Not sure how much historic truth was actually in the movie. The acting for the most part was good.",1505433600,3,312,4.362068965517241
6564913,3,B00M97DM7A,Not super accurate. Took definite hollywood liberties. But it's fun enough to watch.,1505260800,2,84,5.538461538461538
6564914,1,B00M97DM7A,This portrays Elizabeth as someone not in charge at all.  She does not inspire anyone in this depiction of Queen Elizabeth and left me confused quite often as to what going on.  There are much better versions of the life of Queen Elizabeth.  This one is just sad.,1505260800,4,263,4.4375
6564915,3,B00M97DM7A,I would have given this fine production at least four stars had they not used modern rather than period music thus disallowing for suspension of disbelief.  So disappointed.  It's like they created a beautiful cake then urinated on it.,1504915200,2,235,5.0
6564916,5,B00M97DM7A,Excellent acting from Duff and Tom hardy. Tom hardy was so seductive that I wonder any woman could resist in real life.,1504656000,,119,4.454545454545454
6564917,5,B00M97DM7A,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  THE MUSIC WAS SO GOOD, I HAD TO PURCHASE THE SOUNDTRACK!!!!
Duff has done a superb job as Queen Elizabeth, way better acting than any shiny Hollywood version I have seen before or since.
Tom Harding is delightful as Robbie, fell in love with the actor before he became the well known celebrity he is now.
Love the costumes and all the characters and I felt this was a better portrayal of her life compared to our American versions of Queen Elizabeth's life.  Seen this movie at least 5 times.",1504569600,,512,4.4361702127659575
6564918,2,B00M97DM7A,"The music was way loud and not appropriate to the period. The portrayal of the queen was domineering, shrill and arrogant. I couldn't see why anyone would be inspired to loyalty and love for her.",1504310400,4,195,4.6
6564919,5,B00M97DM7A,"The Virgin Queen is an amazing series.  This program chronicles the life of Elizabeth and her love, but never lover, Robbie and ultimately his son Robbie.

6564920,2,B00M97DM7A,I love historical fiction movies and literature generally. This is rather more soap opera than anything else. If you like soap operas you'll love this massive load of twaddle.,1503964800,7,175,5.068965517241379
6564921,5,B00M97DM7A,"I've seen this special before and before I re-watch, I was excited enough to write this quick note: Anne-Marie Duff is extraordinary in this!!!! You will not be disappointed if you enjoy period pieces.",1503532800,,201,4.9411764705882355
6564922,4,B00M97DM7A,"Wonderful presentation of Queen Elizabeth I.  But, it appears the movie has been cut in recent months.  Several scenes no longer there, including a scene where she dances with envoy of Hanover King. Even cover of movie is different.  Why has this happened?  Original movie was just fine the way it was. I've seen the movie several times so I noticed the changes right away.",1503446400,,373,4.6923076923076925
6564923,5,B00M97DM7A,Well done,1503360000,,9,4.0
6564924,3,B00M97DM7A,"I watched this at a friend's house, and while I enjoyed the first two episodes, I thought the third was rushed and superficial. It was as if the writers had hit the highlights of Elizabeth's reign--the conflict with her sister and Philip II, the marriage controversy, Robin Dudley and the Amy Robsart Affair, etc--until the armada. Then in the middle of episode three, the writers fobbed the audience off with a notice, '32 years later', and hastened to an end.

The actress playing Elizabeth, who reminded me of Bette Davis playing Elizabeth, was more than adequate, but the men left me cold: Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, seemed loutish and charmless, and there was little chemistry between him and Elizabeth, despite the actors doing their best to convince us otherwise. His successor in her favour, Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, whinged and moaned to such an extent that one was almost happy to see him sent to the Tower.

While the costumes were colourful, they presented a hodgepodge of styles between what Elizabeth was wearing and what her female courtiers were wearing. The styles also ran contrary to what we know from her portraiture. For example (according to art historian Roy Strong), when Elizabeth was of marriageable age, she played the part of the Virgin Queen to the hilt with high ruffed necklines, but after the threat of marriage was no longer an issue and she had passed her childbearing years, down came the necklines, up went the sunlike lace standing collars that framed her face. She became the ""Eternal Astraea, the Goddess of Endless Spring."" The costumer ignored the progression of styles apparent in her portraiture.

Despite the rushed third episode, however, I think I would have enjoyed the series as a wholeafter all, Elizabeth's life was both eventful and suspensefulif it hadn't been for that ghastly soundtrack of 21st-century so-named 'Mediaeval Babes' caterwauling with their maddeningly harsh voices. Every time I began to become absorbed in the narrative, the Babes would rupture the fragile barrier between the world of the 16th-century and that of today.

The series is, nevertheless, worth watching, but it really needed a couple of more episodes to develop the characters in what could have been a first-class historical drama.",1503273600,29,2287,5.058355437665782
6564925,5,B00M97DM7A,Outstanding. Anne-Marie Duff is a perfect Elizabeth. Tom Hardy is awesome. So well done.,1503273600,,88,5.357142857142857

6564927,5,B00M97DM7A,Beautiful depiction of her story. Very brief portrayal though..only three episodes .,1503187200,,84,6.083333333333333
6564928,1,B00M97DM7A,Nothing but a modern day soap opera.  Horribly historically inaccurate - I stopped at the end of the second episode.  What a disgraceful production for the amazing woman that she was. Acting was good but not excellent.,1503100800,6,218,4.864864864864865

6564930,5,B00M97DM7A,"Such a sensationally interesting version of Elizabeth.  Anne-Marie Duff is always just amazing in absolutely everything she does, and here - spectacular throughout.  The script, direction, the everything -- so very intimate.  No need to rhapsodize, though I could - more important to tell you to watch it without delay.  It's SO GOOD.",1503014400,,334,5.245283018867925
6564931,5,B00M97DM7A,Ms. Duff was brilliant! I wish this could have been even longer. I wasn't prepared for it to end.,1502755200,2,97,4.157894736842105
6564932,5,B00M97DM7A,"By far and away one of the best historical drama of Elizabeth I. The only rival might be that of Glenda Jackson's Elizabeth series. The word ""drama"" is actually redundant here, as the story is closely told to events as they unfolded with much historical accuracy- meaning the true events in themselves were dramatic enough without need for embellishment. Which thankfully were not done with gratuity here.

I'm amazed I hadn't been aware of this superlative series before! Elizabeth is played with breathtaking commitment and with the complexity and believability  of Elizabeth's personal motivations weaved in with those of duty. Over all fantastic acting by all, complete with subtlety to bravado and at all times .

There was only one distraction for me, and that was the props, Paper that was historically parchment was constantly balled up as if it were flimsy Canon copy paper, and swords of the day which were typically heavy sometimes appeared small and light, almost toylike.

But these considerations are so minor- everything else as mentioned- especially the acting, the makeup for the aging Elizabeth, the editing, the sets, etc-were simply superior. A joy to watch.",1502582400,6,1178,5.151832460732984
6564933,5,B00M97DM7A,"A brilliant depiction of life as it was then, a court full of traitors and whisperers, and a young queen who decided to go it alone and forgo marriage for the sake of her country.  The acting was excellent, most especially that of the queen.",1502582400,2,241,4.355555555555555
6564934,5,B00M97DM7A,"I viewed the series in one sitting. It was powerfully done.
And was reminded that it is a difficult thing to be a monarch, one inherits leadership by Divine Right, and to have this responsibility to God and Kingdom encapsulated in the fragility of human existence.",1502496000,4,264,4.760869565217392

8670834,2,B00M97DM7A,"I'm not a English history expert, so I was lost in some of the story.  For example, Mary Queen of Scots suddenly appeared as a contender for the throne without an explanation.  I also wondered what had happened to Dudley when he suddenly changed appearance in the second episode (I found out later, when reading a biography on Elizabeth I that 30 years had passed).  And the third episode was so bad, with a balding Elizabeth, and a balding Elizabeth I copy (Earl of Essex' mom) I didn't know what the heck was going on, I thought Elizabeth was having another of her bad dreams.  I just quit watching 20 minutes into it and read the Elizabeth I bio online.  They missed a very important part of Elizabeth I's life, she supported the arts during her reign, a very important aspect of the Elizabethan Era.",1512691200,,803,4.510344827586207
