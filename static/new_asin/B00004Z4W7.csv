1383347,5,B00004Z4W7,"I don't see many concerts, so I may be easily impressed.  Oxygene Moscow brings tears to my eyes it is so powerful and beautiful.  I think of what day to day life for Russian people must be like.  With all their trouble it is still their country and they must have pride and hope.  The concert must have brought them great joy.  The visuals were so large and coordinated with the music beyond anything I have ever seen.  I've seen the DVD 4 times and I see something different each time.  I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I cry each time.  The whole thing is so powerful and I feel so good for the Russian people.  I made an audio tape to play in the car.  I'm still hearing different things than I saw and heard before.",1046822400,10,726,4.195652173913044
1383348,5,B00004Z4W7,The title says it all. Why isn't there more of the masters concerts available in this format? His cd's will never be the same after you have seen this.,1024099200,,151,4.241379310344827
1383349,5,B00004Z4W7,"I personally have several Jarre CDs and enjoy the music immensely, but to actually experience his concerts on video/DVD truly brings the music to life.  The incredible mix of music, media screens, lasers, live choirs and orchestras, spectacular stage performances, and mind-blowing pyrotechnics - as well as this particular concert's surprise from above - is absolutely essential to a true understanding of the genius of Jean-Michel Jarre.
Also highly commendable is the beautiful camera choreography throughout the concert.  A spectator in the audience 9especially one close enough to see the stage performance) would be highly overwhelmed because there is so much to look at, but the camerawork both selects the important highlights of the near-perpetual visual blitz while still rendering this same jubilant overwhelming of the senses.
For any Jarre fan, and anyone who enjoys truly spectacular experiences, this is certainly a MUST-HAVE item!!!!!!!!!",1002672000,12,954,5.618055555555555

1383351,5,B00004Z4W7,"The tunes in this dvd are some of the best you'll ever get to hear from the master of the electronic music. Filled with more than 15 songs, it features hits as Oxigene4, oxygene 7 and 10, rendez vous and many other. While the camera director could've shown us more of the general ambiance in Moscow, I'm pretty happy to just get a glimpse of my favorite musician. The 50 minutes documentary with itnerviews and music from JMJ is a must you can't miss.",995587200,,451,4.380952380952381
1383352,3,B00004Z4W7,The fact that I could see JMJ performing is even amazing. However it was hard for me to feel a real concert feel from this dvd. The sound quality is good but the vision is disappointing. I felt like this was rather a movie or documentary than a concert. The camera angle is not precise and do not expect you can see him performing accurately. I saw this dvd only one time fully and now I'm forgetting the existence of it. I do hope I could get a real good (concert) dvd of JMJ before long.,984787200,3,489,4.104166666666667
1383353,3,B00004Z4W7,"For Jean-Michel Jarre fans in the US, this DVD is a must-buy for the simply reason that this is only the second time that there has been an NTSC-formatted Jarre video.  (The Houston concert video from 1987, now out of print, was the last time.)  The video, once again, documents an achievement of enormous scale.
So why the reserved 3-star rating?  Jarre concerts have always been difficult to capture on film - his canvas is nothing less than the skyline.  But this film seems to completely avoid this challenge altogether by focusing on close-ups on stage.  Views of the vast, painted, building-scape are occasional.  This documentation of the concert stands in stark contrast to what the live audience surely experienced - a unique fusion of architecture, music, and pyrotechnics.  And although the Young Bolshoi Dancers are listed as part of the concert, they are not seen on this video.
The soundtrack is solid but unexceptional.  No high-quality PCM audio track is available - only the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 or 2.0.  The balance matches the film, focusing on close-up sound rather than capturing the pyrotechnics-music combination that the audience must have heard.
The documentary will turn out to be far more interesting for many fans.  Again, for US fans, this is the only chance to catch a glimpse, however brief, of footage from other concerts such as Docklands (London) and La Defense (Paris).  This 53-minute piece traces Jarre's entire career, with particular attention placed on the evolution of his ground-breaking concerts.",984614400,25,1545,5.115537848605578
1383354,5,B00004Z4W7,"As a true Jean Michel Jarre fan I was very pleased with this DVD. The behind-the-scene feature gives a great view of not only JMJ in private but also his family, crewmembers, etc.  The picture quality could have been better from time to time but the 5.1 digital audio feature really compensates all of that.",976233600,,307,4.581818181818182
1383355,5,B00004Z4W7,"As one of the fortunate one's to attend this concert, I'd thought I
share my views about the video and soon DVD.
I've been to many of
Jean Michel's concerts, and I think that Moscow has to be one of the
best.  The video goes some way to reflect the atmosphere of ""Oxygen
in Moscow"", but doesn't beat actually being there!
Some of the
tracks have been cut, and cut badly in some places, but the video
still stands as a testament to the whole concert.
The audio /
visual quality on the video is quite good, and the quality of the DVD
should be superb!
A documentary called ""Making The Steamroller
Fly"" is also included on the DVD - this is great insight into
the way Jean Michel's mind works.  If you are a die-hard fan, or you
just saw the ""Rendez-Houston: A City in Concert"" show, buy
it!!

7928260,3,B00004Z4W7,"Jean Michel Jarre's DVD for Oxygene Moscow was well made, and aimed at a young audience with many special effects for his music.
Your service in sending the DVD was excellent.  We received it here in Brazil in perfect shape.",1212105600,,224,4.6
7928261,4,B00004Z4W7,"To truly experience Jean Michel Jarre, you have to be there. However, if you can't, this is not bad at all. They did a decent job capturing the event, but were smart enough to keep the camera mostly on him. He is entertaining all on his own, and his shows are too complex for video. The true goldmine on this DVD, I found, was the extra feature where they chronologically go through his past concerts giving you bits and pieces on how they were made, what went on in his life at the time, and actual footage from the shows. That by itself was worth the purchase. So if you're a fan, this will not disappoint you. Just don't buy it expecting to feel the full Jean Michel Jarre experience.",1187740800,2,687,4.292307692307692

7928263,3,B00004Z4W7,"I bought this DVD back in May 2000, and it became the first one in my actual collection.  I have to say that i am a SUPER FAN of JMJ since 1981 when i listened to a ""Oxigene"" Dreyfuss Tape, but this DVD doesn't capture the real essence and excitement of a JMJ  concert...That's why i give it 3 stars, just for the music, not for the production.  Hey, Mr. Jarre, Where's the ""Concert for Tolerance"", I have it  on a VHS tape, i recorded from HBO back in 1996...This is the BEST CONCERT EVER!!...I Know it is available only in Laserdisc and in PAL system!!",1139270400,,554,4.19811320754717
7928264,3,B00004Z4W7,"I have the complete concert recorded, and even though the sound quality is poor (had to remaster it many times), the concert was superb.
Now for this DVD... what we have here is edited concert, what could be also explained with the word 'Oxygene'. For example, we have about 6 minutes of Rendez-Vous 2, and in the concert a 9-minute edit was played. Since the DVD is Oxygen in Moscow, they have scrapped f.ex. 'Ethnicolor', 'Equinoxe 7' and 'Equinoxe 4', and even more is missing. And many of the other tracks are edited, and like previous reviewer said, the sounds don't sync.
Like previous reviewer also said, the laser harp seems like it hasn't no sensor or no trigger. During the concert, the laser harp was mailfunctioning a little (some notes sounded strange), so it wasn't really fake. But in this DVD, IT SEEMS LIKE ONE!
First I would have given 5 stars to this DVD. Like it first seemed to be. Good music and great performance (althought I would like to see something else than the players since this is a Jarre-concert...). But I take one star out because many of the songs were left out or then edited (excerpt of Chronologie 6 in the end doesn't make me feel better...). Again one star out for not bothering synchronising the drums/laser harp/etc. One star out for not having any extras (like the better Brazilian edition). So 2 stars for the DVD. But I'll add 1 star for the DVD because of 'Making the Steamroller Fly'-document. It is great to view for people who don't know a rats arse about Jarre, nice document.
And this is the only Jarre DVD that exists, what is very sad to me. I would like to see 'Paris La Defense', 'Destination Docklands' etc. via DVD. But then again, we could have the edits of the concerts. However, as this is the only Jarre DVD, it is very nice bonus to Jarre-collection. But it has it's flaws...",1066348800,16,1838,4.539156626506024
7928265,5,B00004Z4W7,"I was present at Jean-Michel Jarres awesome 1988 London Docklands Concert.  Nothing has compared since.
The next best thing however is Oxygene Live in Moscow.  Put simply, this is a wonderful concert.  The tracks all blend in nicely together, the sound quality is excellent for a live event and the lasers, lights and fireworks make for an breathtaking listening experience.
Jarre plays his keyboards and laser harp with is usual panache, and in particular I thought that Oxygene 13 was a great choice of closing song.  Very moving.
- Overall, you'd be quite insane to miss this if you are a Jarre fan.",1051142400,7,602,4.815533980582524
