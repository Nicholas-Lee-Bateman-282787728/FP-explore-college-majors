You think for something made in 2010 they would have atleast had a computer to do the effects rather then vcr movie editing equipment from 1980 They should have just gave the movie over to Troma to produce or Gwar.  alot of it was hard to follow because it's so bad.  I did expect the quality to be bad as it's a b movie but still anybody that owns a computer now a days even a mac could do better movie editing.  Also needs alot of work on the story line with continuity.  There is nothing tying the 3 stories together as a horror film like the first tales from the crypt i think or a few others that had differant stories in them.  They all tied together usally somehow.,1457827200,,809,4.114649681528663

8515431,1,B007EQQATS,"Wow, this movie is pretty bad. I'm an avid troma fan and have seen some bad movies but this one takes the cake. Its confusing, lazy and just terrible. I mean c'mon it looks like no effort was put into this. The one star is for the soundtrack, Calabrese, F.K.U, Ghoul and all the other bands are the only redeeming quality for this",1340150400,3,330,4.253968253968254
8515432,5,B007EQQATS,"i know for a fact dave ""oderus urungus"" brokie(aka a sergent in our us military) has been wanting to make a movie with lloyd kaufmann of troma team for many years now and has finally done it.

apparently brokie has been hessitant to do so because of lloyd kuafmann rep for having to control his actors.

this film better be a classic, because i have been quitely boycotting troma due to their ""shame"" concerning their
1980's catalog(films being re-edited of all the redneck content?).

dave brokie/oderus urungus, you better be great in this, your metal rep depends on it.

your us military status, however? unjudged!!!",1334880000,3,619,4.866666666666666
