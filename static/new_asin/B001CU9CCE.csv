Even more impressive is the fact that all his accomplishments were achieved despite being denied formal education because of his illegitimacy.

The DVD asserts that Da Vinci's war inventions were particularly focused on terrifying opponents.  One was a giant crossbow that spanned 27 yards; armored vehicles (powered by eight soldiers inside turning crankshafts, cannon shells that exploded on impact, a robot knight (extremely limited in its capabilities), mobile bridges, and a mobile cart were others.

Da Vinci's backward writing, very difficult for others to read, is believed to be an early form of patent protection that he used.

Da Vinci also put considerable effort into flight, beginning with the study of birds.  One of his early innovations in this area was to study potential propeller pitches effect on water flow.  While his helicopter design, powered by four men and using pitched rotors was unable to fly (too heavy), it was carefully studied hundreds of years later by Igor Sikorsky as part of his creating the first flyable helicopter.  Another design was for a flying ornithopter with wings that would twist.

Bottom Line:  Da Vinci was a Renaissance Man, par excellence.",1220486400,,1348,5.227906976744186
