2199360,4,B00070HK2Y,"IT HAPPENED TO JANE was up until this DVD release something of a `lost classic', having never been released on video and appearing only rarely on TV and cable.  Doris Day stars in another domestic comedy which suits her wholesome girl-next-door persona to a tee.

She plays Jane Osgood, a young widow in Cape Anne, Maine, who runs a lobster farming business.  When one of her shipments returns with the lobsters dead inside, Jane discovers that it was the fault of the railroad company.  She turns to her old friend George Denham (Jack Lemmon) a young lawyer, and together they take on the tyrannical head of the railways Harry Foster Malone (Ernie Kovacs).  It's a cute, often very funny comedy.  Doris Day and Jack Lemmon are fresh and appealing in the lead roles, and Day gets 2 numbers (""Be Prepared"" and the Title Song).  The movie also features Mary Wickes, Steve Forrest and Jayne Meadows.  Based on a story by Max Wilk and Norman Katkov.

The DVD picture looks great, in a colourful anamorphic print.  Extras consist of trailers for other Columbia classic movie titles.",1111449600,58,1077,4.772972972972973
2199361,4,B00070HK2Y,"Columbia's spring, 1959 release, ""It Happened to Jane"" should have been a box-office smash. It certainly had all the makings of a hit.

Starring Doris Day and Jack Lemmon, two of the screen's most gifted comic performers, featuring a great supporting cast and set amidst some of the most beautiful scenery seen up to that date in wide-screen, it nevertheless opened and closed rather quickly.

Perhaps it was the title or the general lack of enthusiasm the studio seemed to have for the film, but it nevertheless provided more than ample entertainment for audiences who did venture into the theatres where it played and now, beautifully presented on DVD (It was never, oddly enough, given a release on video), it should more than provide ample pleasures for those who purchase or rent this delightful romp.

In short it is the story of a widow, with two children, who raises lobsters in a small Maine town who takes on a mighty railroad whose indifference had caused her to lose a shipment. She is assisted in her battle by smalltown lawyer/boyfriend, Jack Lemmon. This being Hollywood, the outcome may seem rather predictable but getting there is such fun that you can't help but smile throughout and from time to time let out a major guffaw.

The film was released about 6 months before Doris Day began her many year reign as the top box-office star in the world. The film that made that possible was ""Pillow Talk"". She was Oscar-nominated for her turn in that film but she is equally as good as Janie Osgood in this picture.

She beautifully epitomizes the strong willed, determined New England stock she plays and the audience is rooting for her from the first frame. It is a very skilled performance utilizing the natural empathy audiences feel for her and allowing her to display her one of a kind comic timing coupled with the ""heart"" comedy that she does better than anyone else. Miss Day and Lemmon are great together and one can only wish they'd had another chance to work together since they are naturals.

Lemmon does the sometimes neurotic, high-strung portrayal that he did skillfully for decades but it has rarely been funnier and more apt.

Ernie Kovacs has the role of his lifetime as railroad mogul, Harry Foster Malone. He chews the scenery with such skill and his scenes with Day and Lemmon are memorable. You dislike his character but also enjoy the relish with which the actor plays it.

Great supporting performances are contributed by Steve Forrest, Parker Fennelly, who briefly tried to fill Percy Kilbride's shoes in a ""Kettle"" comedy at Universal, and Mary Wickes, making her fourth big screen appearance opposite Miss Day. (She would appear opposite her one more time, ten years later when she guest-starred on Miss Day's hit CBS television series).

Richard Quine, who never achieved major success as a director despite a handful of good films and would forever be known as the man who accidentally shot and paralyzed his one time actress-wife Susan Peters, directs with confidence and capability. As noted by many, there is a Frank Capra-esque quality about the proceedings.

Miss Day sings the title tune and another song during the film in her customary way (i.e. one of the screen's best female singers), and there are surprise appearances by several game show performers of the time.

""It Happened to Jane"" may finally gain the reputation it deserves as one of 1959's happiest surprises.",1109376000,86,3421,4.870912220309811
2199362,5,B00070HK2Y,"I can only confirm the above rave reviews for this movies - it's my favorite Doris Day-movie and I already wrote to Columbia 2 years ago, that they should release it on DVD, since it was not even released on Laserdisc. I read in one of the above reviews that the movie should be titled ""Plain Jane"" - in the 3rd Bear Family-Records-CD-Box (""Que sera"" - recommended as well!) one can read that actually the movie was intended to be titled after the novel it is based upon - ""That Jane from Maine"". That CD-Box also includes 2 versions of the never-before-released recording of the song ""That Jane from Main"", Doris recorded for this movie (in the meantime also available on a Sony-Comilation). It`s the same melody as ""It happened to Jane"" (which had to be recorded after the movie had been re-titeled), but a completely different arrangement, faster, with the drummer imitating a steam engine as intro - the lyrics are totally different as well.

It`s a pity - since DVD and soundtrack-recording belong to Sony (Columbia)- that this different song -and perhaps the original soundtrack- was not put onto the DVD as an extra. If they could not find bonus film material that's one thing, the songs would have been possible. But that of course would have required creative energy...

Enjoy the movie :-)",1109116800,16,1299,4.743362831858407
2199363,5,B00070HK2Y,"Finally, the movie we've been waiting for is out on DVD!  It didn't even get a video release, I have no idea why.  Maybe the rights were tied up in some arcane way.

Richard Quine made many delightful films and in particular he must have been in love with Kim Novak for he made her look divine in many of their pictures together, but here he works the same magic on Doris Day, whose blonde beauty is a very different kettle of fish than Novak's.  Quine's comic genius is evident in every scene in this film, whether it's Doris getting mad at Jack Lemmon, blowing her bangs up over her forehead in her patented double-take, or posing Doris next to a troop of little Boy Scouts and teaching them to ""Be Prepared,"" a number which nowadays smacks of the Mary Kay LeTourneau school of pedagogy.  However it's a great song and the orchestrations for this (and the title number, ""It Happened to Jane"") have that lush Nelson Riddle sound that totally matches Doris Day's creamy, luscious voice.  She's a lovely, determined single mother here, who routinely puts off Jack Lemmon's proposals of marriage in order to get more fishing time in.  Between this movie and the one where Arthur Godfrey runs the GLASS BOTTOM BOAT, Doris and fishing lines are inextricably entangled.

I usually don't like Ernie Kovacs in the movies, thinking that he's more a small screen TV type of star, but he is very effective in JANE, and he plays a good foil for both Doris and for Jack Lemmon.  He's the great railroad tycoon who threatens to tear up the state of Maine in a variation of the old Western theme.

The color is bright and crisp, I just wish they had included some deleted scenes.  My grandmother used to say that this movie used to be called, ""Plain Jane,"" and they changed the title because Melcher didn't want Doris to be featured in a movie that called her ""plain""!  No fear in this movie where she still looks young, and radiant.  One of her best.",1109030400,11,1937,4.515759312320917
2199364,5,B00070HK2Y,"WOW, could not beleive it when I saw this was going to be released. Has been one of my ones on my ""Wish it was on DVD"" list. Doris Day is fantastic along with Jack Lemmon in this delightful comedy on a young woman taking on corporate america in the 50's and winning. Am so glad to see the movie companies finally opening up there vaults and releasing good movies for us all to enjoy. You can be sure I will be getting this the day it is released.",1108771200,9,446,4.022471910112359
2199365,5,B00070HK2Y,"I almost fell of my chair when I saw this.

I have a VHS of this rare movie in my DOris Day Collection since I own all 39/39 of her films. And this is one of my all time favorites. Doris Day plays Jane Osgood, a young widow with 2 young children, and she owns a lobster business. Well her lobsters come back dead in the train and she finds out that they wern't taken to there destination soon enough. Because of the new President of the Railroad Company Harry Foster Malone (Ernie Kovacs). So she and her lawyer/boyfriend/lifetime friend Jack Lemmon. GO to fight against him and at the end she wins, and Harry Foster Malone becomes a new nicer man then he was before. This movie also features a few great Doris Day songs including It Happened To Jane, and Be Prepared. This is a great movie that I highly suggest you buying. I will be buying this dvd the day it comes out.",1103155200,20,872,4.253012048192771

2199427,5,B00070HK2Y,"This is not, as some reviewers would have it, a Great movie. That's simply too grandiose and inflated term to apply. This is a Doris Day-Jack Lemmon film. Who could ask for anything more. Both are relatively young and vibrant, both manifest fully the effervescent yet distinctive qualities which marked them as something special and unique. Qualities necessary for any star as opposed to those required to be an outstanding actor or actress. This is not to say that one cannot  be both a Star and a a superior actor; just that the two qualities often do not go together. Plaudits, too, to Ernie Kovacs as the meanest man in the world, who does a fine  job as the foil against whom the two stars react. He is just right as the nasty guy. Supporting roles are well done as well; I cannot put a name to the guy playing the old railroader, the Jack Lemmon character's  uncle, but he does  deserve special mention.
I know that there are those who find Doris Day too saccharine in most of her films, but for the rest of us, it is almost always a joy to see her at work. While never quite the box-office smash that DD was in her peak years, the same can be said of the work of Lemmon. Whatever he did, he did well.

Doris Day and Jack Lemon take on a town and a tycoon, the stuff America was built on in my generation.  Helps me remember my roots  and keeps hope alive. Relationships were important during this era, so was integrity and dreams. Today's young people should watch this. Preserving history is essential to our future, and this is a period piece.

This lesser known Doris Day film is just as sweet & innocent as many of her others. I'm not sure why this one is somewhat forgotten. It has all the charm of ""The Thrill Of It All"" & ""With Six, You Get Eggroll"". Doris even sings 2 songs! And don't get me started on that nifty wood-paneled station wagon. I want one!",1367280000,3,460,4.488095238095238

Maine lobsters are her livelihood, she's a widow in a small town where they still have town meetings to make all important decisions. Through in a railroad and lawyers and you get lots of fun.

Doris Day and Jack Lemmon were so cute together. They naturally looked like old friends  when they had a conversation about their childhood on-screen. There are some funny scenes- George was often running very hard to save a pet lobster, Sam's life. When Jane proposed to George, he was getting all covered with coal smoke.

2199481,5,B00070HK2Y,"This movie is an absolutely delightful time warp. It was filmed almost entirely in the small Connecticut River town Of Chester in the late 50s. There were no special effects used and no fake buildings erected. Except for the 5 professional actors almost all of the characters in the film are local people from Chester and the surrounding towns, (Haddam, Deep River and Essex) One of the little boys is Mickey Rooney's son. It was probably Ernie Kovaks last film and one of Jack Lemmon's first. All of the cars seen in the film were rented from locals. The town hall used in the movie is actually the historic Chester Town Hall still in use today. A visitor would recognize the center of town immediately as it has changed little in the last 50+ years. The steam train in the moview was used for decades to give rides up and down the lower part of the Connecticut River.
This movie is about as ""G"" rated as it gets and a great movie for the younger kids. Good triumphs over evil and evil morphs into good by the end of the film. A lot of fun for the grandparents and the grandkids.",1315612800,6,1080,4.378109452736318
2199482,4,B00070HK2Y,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this movie. My 1960 summer job in coastal Maine was working 7 days a week in a hotel kitchen, and our only entertainment that summer was a trip once a week to the local movie theater. For 51 years I have remembered fondly seeing this warm, little movie set in coastal Maine (I now see it was shot in Chester CT, but it makes no difference, it looks like Maine) with beautiful Doris Day (age 35), Jack Lemmon, and the great Ernie Kovacs in an over the top performance, yelling to his advertising man ""more broads, how do you expect to sell anything without broads"".

I just watched it for the first time in 51 years, and while it has a few corny moments, like 3 or 4 times someone runs to throw the kid's 'pet' lobster back into the water, it is still enjoyable. Doris is a delight and Ernie, what can you say.",1315180800,5,844,4.146341463414634

2199491,4,B00070HK2Y,This is another one of those classic movies in which Jack Lemmon underplays his part and puts the attention on his co-star and yet every scene in which he appears become the memorable moments of the picture.  Ernie Kovacs as the comedic villan adds his own special take to the pace of the film.  The authentic townsfolk from Cape Ann in Maine and their town meeting and election of a selectman is a piece of Americanna that bears closer attention by those who have a love for New England and the kind of people it has bred and nurtured that are exemplified in Doris and Jack's characters.,1232236800,2,588,4.485981308411215

We didn't show it because,though clean, 'twas a bit corney, and the plot very slow.  It had a happy ending and right prevailed, but Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday"" was a better choice.

2199498,4,B00070HK2Y,"Richard Quine was an underrated talent and his light and crisp direction of this movie is one reason why it is a fun piece of work. It stars Doris Day as Sara Osgood a young widow in a small Maine town .She has two small children -a boy and a girl-and runs her own business supplying live  lobsters to restaurants and hotels in New Englsnd and environs .She is shocked when a large consignment is returned dead ,having died thanks to swingeing cuts in services ordered by the haed of the railroad ,the avaricious scrooge-like Henry Foster Malone (Ernie Kovacs).Sara takes the railroad to court  aided by her friend  the somewhat diffident and undynamic George Denham(Jack Lemmon) who is devoted to Sara but has nevber gone public with his feelings .She wins but when the railroad resorts to delaying tactics she seizes a train belonging to the railroad and in the process becomes a national celebrity ,the champion of the ""little people"".A newspaperman assigned to do a story on her ,Larry Howe(Steve Forrest)complicates matters by falling in love with her much to the chagrin of George .

As the battle with the railroad escalates stakes are raised and the climax features a race to get the next batch of lobsters to their destination in the face of obstructionism from Malone

This is a bright movie in every respect -the colour is eye catching ,the script is lively and characterful and it presents an essentialy sunny view of people and their inmherent niceness.the town seems almost impossibly friendly and the inhabitants sparky and essentially good ,Its a picture radiating a cock-eyed optimism about human nature and thus very likeable .all the actors are on top form but for my money it is Kovacs who steals the show ,basing his performance on the then head of Columbia Pictures ,Harry Cohn a man noted for being mean and mean spirited .
This is an enjoyable experience that might not make you laugh out loud but it will raise a lot of smiles all round",1197417600,5,1961,4.73900293255132

He was, sort of, he played Pa in the final Ma & Pa after Percy Kilbride passed.
