8706652,5,B00UGQBK8Y,"A foreboding tale of desperation with absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel. Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows is just that... a small wing of the French resistance literally moving around like shadows knowing that the daily gamble they live is the only choice they have to experience their next barely free breath. Cinematography is gorgeous, acting is phenomenal and the direction can only come from someone who has experienced this type of cold harsh existence first hand. A must have for those who appreciate the slow burn of brilliantly subtle cinematic storytelling.",1479686400,,584,5.157894736842105
