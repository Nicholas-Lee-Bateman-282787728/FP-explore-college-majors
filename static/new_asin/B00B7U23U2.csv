5562351,5,B00B7U23U2,"This DVD came out just as interest in Richard of Gloucester was rekindled by the discovery - and the later confirmation - of his mortal remains underneath a Leicester carpark. (To the loopier Ricardians and Henricians out there: Yes, a man with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis most certainly could have been the effective warrior that Richard III was known to be. For one thing the stiffly-made cloth and leather jacks knights typically wore under armor, or even as armor, would have braced him quite nicely. No, he didn't have a withered arm, so he could have swung a sword or axe just fine.  So there. :-)

The DVD shows Middleham as a castle that was both grand yet homey.  One can understand why Richard and his wife Anne Neville loved it so much.  It was a castle when castles were about to be made obsolete by the construction of cannons, so its very homeyness presages this, and the DVD captures this.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more on the outer bailey but I understand that far less is known about that area than the castle proper.

Well done!",1364428800,7,1064,4.544502617801047
5562352,5,B00B7U23U2,"If you are interested in Richard III, Middleham, The Wars of the Roses (The Cousins' War) you will hopefully find this as interesting as I did.  It has been nearly 30 years since I visited Middleham and I was fascinated to see the staircases and walkways that have been added.  The CG gives a very good idea, I believe, of what it must have looked like inside.  You just have to use your imagination to see the busy and active life being led there.  The narrator was knowledgable and the guided tour fairly complete.  I would have liked to see more information about the outer bailey.  I will refer to it every time I read a book that takes me there.  Although informative, interesting and enjoyable, I would have preferred a price of $10 and would not pay more than $14.99 for it.  Thank you to Joseph Fox and friends for brining this fascinating place to life for me - I have always wondered what it looked like.",1363824000,4,914,4.398809523809524
8563741,5,B00B7U23U2,"Very interesting for real students of this period. For the casual viewer the lack of slick presentation may lead some to rate it lower but believe me, this kind of detailed information on castles and castle building is very hard to find in video format. Loved the 3D computer graphics that showed how it used to look vs the rough pile of rocks it appears as today. This is exactly the kind of video I have been looking for for years and I wish there were more like it. Too many medieval histories want to focus on the soap opera drama among the Barons, whereas I love the nuts and bolt of how things were made, why they were made, and the design changes over the years. Fox did a great job on this, don't let some of the bad reviews mislead.",1517529600,,741,4.225352112676056

8563747,2,B00B7U23U2,"Okay, there was some good information in here, but the presenter is an odd individual with a very emotional need to defend Richard III. I get that historically, Richard III was a complex character and it is bizarre the way some historians over-emphasize his negative qualities, but the presenter seems equally bizarre in the other direction. And that bit had nothing really to do with understanding or exploring Middleham Castle.",1393372800,3,429,5.142857142857143
8563748,5,B00B7U23U2,I've always wondered about the layout of Middleham Castle.  As a typical visitor to the Castle ruins I've never been able to sort out exatly what it was I was seeing.  This video breaks down each room and with the use of technology even suggests what they might have looked like in Richard 3's time.  I'll watch this multiple times but even just once gives us so many pieces to the puzzle.  Very nice!,1390867200,3,401,4.378378378378378
8563749,5,B00B7U23U2,"This show was very well done.  I wish they would do one on every castle.  They did a great recreation of what it looked like during it's hayday, when Richard III lived there with his wife Anne Neville.  They went over where the servant's lived and how the halls and rooms might have looked in the late 1400's.  Very interesting.",1389139200,3,328,4.416666666666667
