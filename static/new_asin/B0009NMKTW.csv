2302094,5,B0009NMKTW,"I just love how they use the real classical music. Not the ones played by keyboard that you can listen on Baby Einstein products. My boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 grew up watching Animal Adventures and A Trip to the San Diego Zoo. They still love to watch them. It's filled with wonderful video clips of all kinds of animals and great music.  I play the music in the car and at night.  My boys actually love to listen to classical music and understand how the composers try to draw images in listeners' minds through music. They also love the songs with baby genius characters.

My boys also love the Favorite songs & rhymes DVD's. They're such a great 'music video' for kids. The CD's also have many bonus songs we love to listen to.

I now have a 5 mo old baby. I just got this 8 pack and love every one of them! He gets to grow up with all 8!!! He already watches few minutes every now and then and he goes to sleep at night with the classical music.

I think the quality of this DVD & CD combo far exceeds other similar products in the market. I wish they had 6 stars!

This 8 pack is such a great deal!

It includes:

Animal Adventures

A trip to the San Diego Zoo

Mozart and Friends

Mozart and Friends Sleepytime

The Four Seasons

Underwater Adventures

Favorite Nursery Rhymes

Favorite Children's Songs",1176854400,25,1305,4.2693877551020405
2302095,4,B0009NMKTW,"My twin toddlers are really enjoying this set of videos, especially 'Favorite Nursery Rhymes' and 'Favorite Children's Songs.'  At first we were all disappointed because the reviews had described them as being like Baby Einstein videos ""but much cheaper"".  Well we only own 1 Baby Einstein video, but my twins LOVE it: it has talking, puppets, sign language, kids, adults, etc.  With this Baby Genius set, 6 of the 8 videos do not have any talking/singing, but only the visuals and classical music in the background.  It took my twins awhile to adjust to that difference, but now they are really enjoying all the videos.  The two ""Favorite"" videos have singing & dancing and it completely engages them!  I would definately recommend this as a good bang-for-your-buck purchase.",1175558400,,776,5.0234375
2302096,2,B0009NMKTW,"Baby Einstein is much better! The only CD which is good is the one with fav. kids songs... the rest have beautiful images, but they are boring for toddlers.",1174953600,,156,4.413793103448276
2302097,5,B0009NMKTW,"Economically speaking, I wish I had bought the Baby Genius 8-pack first thing.  We only bought the 3-pack.  Our daughter (now 19mos) learns and responds more to Baby Genius than Baby Einstein, so now we are ending up buying the rest anyway.  The Baby Genius audio is mostly classical music (whole pieces from start to finish).  And the video is more of the real thing -- images of real animals or kids -- not as much puppetry or animated characters like in Baby Einstein.  So we think she gets more out of BG.  When we sit and watch with her, (which is the best way for her to learn) it allows us more quality interaction with her .  But when we can't sit down with her, we feel better knowing that she is seeing more real-life images instead of so much puppetry or animation that is on Baby Einstein.  Not that there's anything wrong with animation, and BG does have it, but I think Baby Genius is more thoughtful about using it.  For instance, only a few months into her life in this world, our daughter doesn't know what a cow looks like.  If you put in BE's ""Neighborhood Animals,"" her first intro to cow will be to see a pink, wooden puppet cow that flies!  Or, before she knows what a cabbage is, she will see one move across the screen, as its on the head of a puppet...funny perhaps for us, but does she get it?  Baby Genius introduces her to the world with beautiful shots of real-life animals just doing their thing, and with real kids who see them at the Zoo or play with them.  She names all the animals and squeals with delight to see them play.  Then, just when we thought she was only responding to the animals, she is trying to say ""numbers are friends"" and counts to 6.  (!!)  (There is an occasional animated counting song, or the like, that comes on).  We highly recommend ""A Trip to the San Diego Zoo.""  It will be fun for you too (esp if, like us, you've never been there ; )  Enjoy!",1174348800,19,1904,4.268156424581005
2302098,5,B0009NMKTW,"I just have to say how much I love these videos. I have a 4 month old son who absolutely loves the nursery rhymes and children's songs dvds. He can be in a crying fit and as soon as he hears his dvd start up he quites down and his eyes are glued to the tv. He was never interested in the baby einstein dvds, but he has taken to the baby genius series really quickly.",1173916800,2,366,3.8289473684210527
2302099,5,B0009NMKTW,"I think this is a great buy for the dollar.  The CDs alone are wonderful, I can sing along with my baby to all the songs from my day!",1173312000,2,133,3.586206896551724
2302100,5,B0009NMKTW,"My son is now 15 mon. old. He got the nursery rhymes dvd as a gift last christmas.  We would play it for him everyday!! He just loves it. He will sit and watch the whole thing over and over again. Also an added plus is that i can then get my ""chores"" done around the house.  He now trys to sing along and he dances to the music, it is very cute.  Anytime he is upset or bored we put in the dvd and he gets soooo excited. He has watched it so many times i am worried it might stop working, then we would be in real trouble, haha. Anyway great learning tool for babies of all ages!!!",1163635200,5,581,3.825
2302101,5,B0009NMKTW,"I was looking for CDs of sing-along songs for my son when he was really little -- maybe three months.  We found two of the Baby Genius DVDs with the bonus CDs and have been absolutely thrilled!  These are by far his favorite DVDs.  We play Baby Einstein when we're trying to calm him down, but most of the time, we play Baby Genius to laugh and dance and sing.  There are pictures of other kids, the animation is fun, and the songs are all great sing-along songs for kids.

You can't go wrong with these Baby Genius DVDs!",1125705600,3,521,4.222222222222222
2302102,5,B0009NMKTW,"My daughter loves Baby Genius!  And it's a great deal at $5.00 for each 30+ minute DVD and there's the bonus CD.  Haven't had a chance to listen to the CD but that shouldn't matter.  Unfortunately I bought 6 of the this 8 pack disc at Wal-mart which had them at $6.50 ea.  Still a great deal but here you save $1.50 ea disc! That's a total of a $12.00 saving, no shipping charges (if you choose the free shipping), and no tax.  Again, what a great deal.

And I believe that each disc has the alphabet and numbers scattered here and there which my daughter gets so excited about.  She says the letters and the numbers, calls out the animal names, dances to the songs - she loves these discs.

My daughter grew up (ok, so she's only 2 now) watching Baby Einstein.  Baby Einstein is great too but Baby Genius is a much better deal esp. with the free CD.  You can't go wrong with this.",1125705600,2,881,4.190476190476191
2302103,5,B0009NMKTW,"I have all the Baby Einsteins.  I found this at Sam's and thought it looked similar.  It was half the price of my Einstein collection AND it includes music CD's as well.

I am very surprised more people have not reviewed these.  That could be they are just not advertised as well.  These are similar to the Einstein videos but with a bit more action.  Same concept.  My babies ages 9 months and 2 love them.  The best part is that the music CD's come with them for free!!  For example Baby Einstein videos DO have music soundtracks but you must buy them seperately for the same price.  OUCH!  My babies love to hear the music in the car from their favorite videos but with Einstein you must buy them seperately.

Baby Genius has 2 in each pack.  One is a DVD and the other is a CD soundtrack.  So the babies recognize the music in the car as being from their video at home.  It is really an incredible deal.  Honestly this package is well worth 200 dollars and they are just giving them away at this price.

THese also have a wider variety of music than Baby EInstein.  They have classical plus nursery rhymes and others.  It is fabulous.  One of my greatest finds as a mother of babies/toddlers.",1118880000,17,1196,4.32579185520362

2302145,5,B0009NMKTW,"I am glad I decided to buy this Dvd set, My son can't get enough of these Dvd's, having the ability to have the cds helps a lot too that way he can listen to the songs whenever he wants. I highly recommend, my son enjoys these Dvds more than the Baby Einstein movies. He is 20 months old so if your child is in that age range I am sure they will love it too",1305676800,,357,3.710526315789474

2302150,5,B0009NMKTW,"I purchased this pack, after our VHS tapes wore out! All 3 kids have watched these. The classical music is wonderful. It's a symphony, NOT a KEYBOARD!  Children playing at the zoo, or the aquarium.  I enjoy listening to the music myself!",1193529600,,237,4.619047619047619
2302151,1,B0009NMKTW,"I was given several baby genius dvds as a gift for my granddaughter.  The actual children are OK in them, and the animal footage is great.  The series creators manage to ruin it all with their awful cgi characters, who insert themselves into every scene, completely ruining your child's appreciation of nature, other children singing songs, or whatever is going on.  If you like obnoxious, intrusive ego trippers like Jim Carrey or Robin Williams, you might like this series.  I hate it.  I will be trying to point out to my grandchild how lovely a giraffe is, or get her to clap along with a song, and a huge purple monkey or idiot bear suddenly appears, waving and interupting.  Does ""genius"" mean giving your child mild attention deficit disorder?  Also the music is often overly cute or overly pompous.  Awful.  My whole set is going to the donation box.",1191888000,,858,4.704697986577181
2302152,4,B0009NMKTW,"I bought this set because I needed some supplemental exposure to Spanish (other than myself and a few friends from South America) for my four-month-old son. I had bought the numbers dvd earlier, and it is excellent. My 4-month-old son loves all the videos and gets a huge grin when the DJ and Vinko characters in their big puffy suits come on the screen.  I like the real action and animals and video - It shows him parts of the real world that he doesn't get to see every day.  The Spanish is very good, native speakers and/or imperceptible accents.  A few of the translations could be better (more clever or rhyming), but that is really difficult when you are trying to translate English children's songs that rhyme or have a rhythm.  All in all, they are a great buy, and for a great price.",1179187200,,793,4.448275862068965

8063554,1,B0009NMKTW,"Completely useless waste of DVD material, my money, and whatever resources went into the production of these.  Simple mashup of super low-quality computer animation, footage of zoo animals from someone's handycam, and crappy covers of some classical music I'm sure only used because it's license-free and somehow echoes of the popular Baby Einstein trend these guys are trying to profit off of (not that I'm in any way suggesting you should throw good money at those either, listening to midi versions of songs by dead composers doesn't make anyone a genius, though making millions of dollars off of selling it to misled parents does.)  This is really useless stuff with no standard for educational content.  My kid likes to put 4 of them on the floor and slide around the hardwood on them, but I wouldn't recommend buying them for that, I don't think they're good for the floor.  Much better use of your money: take your kid to the zoo, record everything with your cell phone video, then anytime you want to sit the kid in front of the TV just put on some good tunes and play your home movie.  I guarantee it's higher quality and more educational.",1366243200,2,1148,4.72
