8517086,5,B007I1Q4E0,"If you love animals, you know how hard it is to find a decent Hollywood movie about an animal, especially from the time period in which ""Fearless Fagan"" was produced. But this one is special.

While the movie is somewhat fictionalized, the basic story is true, and what's special is that Fagan the lion plays himself in the movie. He had been so well socialized by his owner, Floyd Humeston, that Fagan's scenes are unlike those in other Hollywood movies. He gets to act naturally. (It also helped that Humeston was present as technical advisor during the making of the movie.)

Also special is Carleton Carpenter's performance as Fagan's owner. He really interacts with Fagan, and really seems to enjoy him. How often do you see that in a movie?

When the wonderful story of Christian the lion was revived as an internet sensation a couple of years ago, Fagan's story should have received at least a little collateral attention. Admittedly, the 1972 film of Christian is a filmed-as-it-happened documentary while ""Fearless Fagan"" is a fictionalized account of true story, but having Fagan himself in the film makes it worthwhile. (And if you're wondering if the movie is suitable for children, there are no Disney-esque villains to give them nightmares, no shocking death scenes. In fact, the movie received a second theatrical release years ago as a children's matinee feature.)

Grab the disc while you can.",1333929600,2,1410,4.961864406779661
