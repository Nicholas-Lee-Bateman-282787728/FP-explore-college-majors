2712197,5,B000LPR6CO,"I really enjoyed this video.  Fred and his group did a fantastic job singing his newest songs, and he also incorporated several of his older songs into the mix.  He rocked the MGM house with his creative twists on his songs for the concert.  Not only did I enjoy the singing and music, but what made this video better than most gospel videos were the camera shots of not only Fred, but also of the musicians and singers.  You get to see everyone who contributes to the songs.  There is also behind-the-scenes footage of Fred and his group (he has a good-looking motorcycle and a nice boat), plus a music video.  I could have watched Fred and his group sing all night long and was disappointed when it ended, but a video must end some time.  :)  Also in the video, Fred ministers to the people in the audience and keeps them on their feet throughout the video.  You have to buy this video.  It's worth the money and remember, when you buy his CDs/tapes/videos, you're supporing his anointed, spirit-filled ministry so that he can continue spreading the gospel through song and music.  It's a plus all the way around.  Fred is so talented because he not only sings the songs, but he writes the songs, produces the songs, writes the music and plays the bass guitar.  I'm happy to see that he's using ALL of his talents to glorify God.  He is a true example for Christians to see that they can still be Christians, use their talents for God and have fun doing it too.  I pray that Fred will go higher and higher in the Lord and will continue to write songs that encourage Christians and uplifts God.",975369600,3,1595,4.43298969072165
2712198,5,B000LPR6CO,Fred Hammond keeps it flowing with another Annointed performance.  The  music is blessed and an appearance by The Colorado Mass Choir just adds to  the blessing. God continues to bless me through the music of Fred Hammond.,969148800,4,222,4.945945945945946
2712199,5,B000LPR6CO,"All I have to say this product is all GOD!!!!!!
This is one fred's  greatest stuff You're gonna love it
FRED Keep working for God!!!",968198400,,132,4.28
2712201,5,B000LPR6CO,This is one of my favorites.  His music is absolutely awesome.  So expertly and well orchestrated and performed.  It's the best.,1360281600,,128,5.0
2712202,5,B000LPR6CO,fred Hammomd is on point from beginning to the end of this concert. His stage presentation and preference is excellent what a man of god .,1351036800,,138,4.346153846153846
2712203,4,B000LPR6CO,This DVD is one of the best concert DVD's I've ever seen regardless of music style. I had no idea Fred had DVD's of his concerts and once I found out about them I couldn't wait to order. This is the first one that I've ordered and will not be the last. Fred has never let me down with his musical ability. This DVD re-confirmed my views of his talents.,1337644800,,352,4.042857142857143
2712204,5,B000LPR6CO,This is not a new dvd but it is still so very relevant and powerful!  The entire dvd is great!,1309996800,,94,3.7
2712205,5,B000LPR6CO,"The cd was absolutely fantastic, so naturally the dvd had to be also. Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed ;-)",1219881600,,113,4.181818181818182
2712206,5,B000LPR6CO,"Wow! I'm only half way into the first song/medley and was compelled to write this review. Wow! Many bands will scale it down for a tour versus the studio but Fred seems to have added musicians: two drummers, full horn section and full choir! Wow! I enjoy the funky stuff more than the ballads but that's just my taste. I'm not even a Christian, I just like good music. I rented this but will surely buy it and gift it many times over. It's so good I want to cry. You can't find popular music this good anywhere.",1196726400,2,511,4.224489795918367
2712207,5,B000LPR6CO,"Folks! i've been a fan of Fred's for years.  Now, when this was originally released on VHS, i loved the video, it's one of his best concerts to date, and my personal favorite.  Through the years, they released other concerts on DVD format, but for some odd reason didn't release this one.  Finally getting my hands on the DVD was all worth it.  Any Fred Hammond fan must have this DVD in their library, next to the ""Pages of Life"" concert and ""Speak Those Things"" which are also out on DVD.  You won't be dissapointed.",1194307200,,518,4.410526315789474
2712208,4,B000LPR6CO,Had the vhs to this and finally have the DVD.  Remember back in the day when a bunch of us youths came to ma house to watch the video man!  Sweet!,1193702400,,146,3.6774193548387095
2712209,5,B000LPR6CO,"I grew up listening to Commissioned and was very disappointed when Fred Hammond went out on his own.  Recently, I was looking for a DVD to include in my worship time, I gravitated toward ""Purpose by Design"".  The spirit was in Las Vegas on that night and, as I continue to watch this DVD, I am blessed more and more.  Many of Fred's favorites are contained w/in this DVD and there are also many exciting 'twists' in the songs that I really enjoyed.  My son, who is 13 yrs. old, loves this also and now knows the words to a lot of the songs.  What a blessing to have Praise and Worship music such as this, to prepare your heart and mind!",1188691200,3,636,4.180327868852459
2712210,3,B000LPR6CO,"I received 2 copies of this DVD which were both defective, the picture freezing intermitently and the sound dropping out now & again which makes watching very frustrating. No extra's on the disc but the concert is very slick with the first 20 mins high energy. Not sure I get the whole Fred on a bike, or Fred in a boat thing - do we really need to see that?",1185840000,,358,4.128571428571429
2712221,5,B000LPR6CO,"This DVD is a MUST have!  Purpose by Design is one of the most powerful life-changing albums you will find.  Most of the songs Fred performs on this DVD are from that album.  Although he throws in a few of his classics from ""Spirit of David"" and other albums.

The spirit of God is very present in the Las Vegas MGM crowd as Fred ushers them into an amazing worship time.  You will wish you were there live.

My favorite part of the DVD is when Fred shares about how we should be thanking God every day.  ""Thank you God for a bran-new mercy, for a new day, Thank you for a day I've never seen.""  It's SO powerful.

Get this DVD for your private worship times.  Get it for those you love also.  It's awesome and you will literally feel the presence of God as it plays on your TV.",1182470400,,778,4.086092715231788
2712222,5,B000LPR6CO,This is a must have for your library if you are a worship leader. If you are a worshipper this is a must have. This is an excellent template if you are a beginner in praise and worship. Highly recommended.,1179100800,,205,4.15
2712223,4,B000LPR6CO,I love this concert it is so fabulous.  But the sound is not synchronized (on my dvd) and it throws off the total effect.  If not for that I would have rated it 5 stars.,1173657600,,169,3.8
2712224,5,B000LPR6CO,"I'm a long time fan of Fred Hammond.  I have all of his Cds and DVDs, this one I think is a tie with Live from Chicago which is my favorite of Fred's productions.  You can't go wrong here, anything Fred does is great.  Big Mo (Maurice Fitzgerald) kills the bass, he's the best bassplayer out there right now.  Stop reading this and order yours already!!!!",1170633600,,355,4.333333333333333
2712225,5,B000LPR6CO,I have this on VHS and the worship & praise is awesome. The medley mix at the beginning is great also. It gives you a taste of Fred & RFC thru the years. I like having a DVD because it gives the ability to skip and review quickly.,1169164800,,230,3.8125
2712226,5,B000LPR6CO,"I love Fred's music, and this is my favorite dvd from him.  If you love ""real gospel"" music, then you need to pick this one up!  The songs and performances are POWERFUL!!!  I was frantically searching for this dvd during Christmas for my mom, but to no avail.  I am glad that it is being rereleased so she can have ""Christmas in January!""",1169078400,,338,4.317460317460317
2712227,5,B000LPR6CO,"I had this on VHS several years ago and loaned it out and never got it back.  This Concert is one of Fred Hammond's best ever.  Including Commissioned Live Reunion Tour.  ""Please don't pass me by"" is as powerful of an experience that you will encounter live or otherwise.  It's my all time favorite Concert of Fred and RFC.",1168905600,,323,4.423728813559322
2712228,5,B000LPR6CO,"I've had the VHS of this for several years.  So, I'm going to order this DVD too.  The performers on this are amazing, and the worship experience is even better.  This is my very favorite music video is any genre.  You even get to see Fred Hammond playing bass at the beginning.  We saw them live at the Ohio State Fair and they were just as good; with 10,000 people in aerobic worship.",1167264000,,386,4.232876712328767
2712229,5,B000LPR6CO,"this is just fabulous. i can not explain this. i live in south africa and we don't get much of these stuff( so bad),but i knew about this cause i'd checked it out on the net. i am so much blessed by all of freds work, that i'm a much better person. i'm also involved in a group and this has just inspired me so much. fred hammond and radical for christ must be the best group ever",1029801600,3,380,3.8846153846153846
2712230,5,B000LPR6CO,"This is an inspiring tape full of great music and praise.  Fred has such a tremendous gift and ability to spread God's love through music. His band and singer's have to be the tightest and one of the most talented collection of artists I've ever heard. I was first exposed to his music when I attended his play, Been There, Done That.  Looking for inspiration with a little humor, you'll enjoy this, but most importantly, I was touched by the message in his music. It has helped me renew my faith and I can't go a day without listening to his music.  I've even bought every sibling in my family and several friends this CD.  Songs like ""Please don't pass me by"", ""When we praise"" and ""Give Me a Clean Heart"" are my favorites and the message is strong and motivational.  Get anointed and blessed and spread love. This is a +10!!!  A must see!!!",992217600,9,843,4.406451612903226

8163332,4,B000LPR6CO,It was a little scratched had to skip 2 songs but other then that it played well. I guess they didn't have the inside jacket with all the credits either.,1441929600,,153,4.133333333333334
8163333,5,B000LPR6CO,Absolutely fabulous. Fred is definitely a worshipper with a dynamic style.,1433203200,,74,5.818181818181818

8163340,2,B000LPR6CO,"The sound quality is awful as well as the picture.  I thought that it was a bootleg copy.  It's dark and the picture messes up throughout the dvd.  I had to turn the volume up as high as possible on my TV in order to hear the musical selections.  Had I not heard Fred Hammonds music before I would never make another purchase of his again.  I'm not sure if t's the studio, the seller, or what, but I do not recommend anyone spending money to purchase this dvd.",1376179200,2,460,4.123595505617978
