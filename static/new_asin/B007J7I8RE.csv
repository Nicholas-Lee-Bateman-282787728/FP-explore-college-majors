8518287,4,B007J7I8RE,"Stage performer Ken Murray began filming home movies of hollywood stars in 1928.  In this 1960 TV special, Ken narrates his home movies for the TV audience.  Fortunately while his segments are kinescoped, the home movies are copied directly from his films and not fuzzy kinescopes.  To add interest, Ken informs us of what movie the star was working on when he took the home movies.

This is not a ""who's who"" of hollywood stars, Ken didn't get to meet everyone, so some of your favorites may not be here.  I was pleased to see Charlie & Sydney Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Clark Gable, The Three Stooges and Jayne Mansfield to name a few.

Ken Murray admits that he may have gotten a few dates wrong as he was working off of memory, and I questioned a few dates as I was watching this.  That is why I give it only 4 stars.",1499817600,,837,4.396103896103896
