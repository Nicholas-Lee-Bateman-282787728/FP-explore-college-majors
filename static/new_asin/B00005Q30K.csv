Not much in the way of a story, acting, costumes, sets... in other words... a real money pit... even for that  time frame! I'm gonna go out in the back yard and dig a pit they can throw money in to next time someone has a really idiotic idea like this one!",1385164800,3,358,3.7733333333333334
7949465,2,B00005Q30K,"Nurse Sherri (Al Adamson, 1978)

Al Adamson, responsible for such timeless classics of cinema history as Hell's Bloody Devils and Cinderella 2000, decided to combine his affinities for bad horror and bad softcore in Nurse Sherri, which is the story of a horny young thing who gets possessed by an evil spirit and then, well, stays a horny young thing. Except that the evil spirit takes over every once in a while and drives Sherri to kill people. (Never mind that, when the evil spirit's agenda is revealed, the murder in which she's been caught in the act has nothing to do with said agenda.) While there's certainly something to be said for seeing the gorgeous Jill Jacobson (in her second onscreen appearance; she has since gone on to be a famous television character actress) alternating between poolside dalliances and running around wielding a pair of cleavers like some sort of butcher ninja, this is about what you'd expect from an Al Adamson joint. The acting ranges from bad to horrible, the direction is barely coherent (an aspect the script lacks), the lighting and sound are pedestrian at best, and the music sounds like it's straight out of the Scooby-Doo fakebook.

I should probably note that not just horror and softcore make their way in here; this is a conglomeration of just about everything Independent International ever tried their hands at. There's a bit of sci-fi (and that section contains some of the funniest effects you will ever see), a bit of blaxploitation, a bit of romance. Really, it's got just about everything. It makes absolutely no sense, but then, does burgoo? It's silly fun, and taken as silly fun, it's immensely satisfying. **",1233964800,5,1670,4.876760563380282
7949466,1,B00005Q30K,"Al Adamson made some truly awful movies (Blood of Ghastly Horror) and some that provides decent entertainment (Brain of Blood, Blood of Dracula's Castle). ""Nurse Sherri"" falls somewhere in between but closer to the awful section. It starts out about some cult and after that it's about some nurse that gets possessed by a demon and starts killing patients. Like several other Adamson movies, I guess this must be one of those movies that were patched together using pieces of other unfinished movies. It is not worth spending money on nor spending the time to watch.",1148774400,,566,4.90625
