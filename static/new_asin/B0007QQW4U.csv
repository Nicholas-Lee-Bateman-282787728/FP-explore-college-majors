8050805,5,B0007QQW4U,"I love David Wilcox's stuff.
This DVD goes into his open tunings and shows you how to play many of my favorite songs from him.

If you can get past the 90's look of the whole thing the content is great.",1362614400,,202,3.926829268292683
8050806,5,B0007QQW4U,"This is a great conversational DVD about open tunings and how to incorporate them into song arranging. It delivers far more than it advertises.

He promises three keys/tunings and delivers 4 or 5, plus the 'asides' and dialogue is full of very helpful hints.",1324166400,2,258,4.863636363636363
8050807,4,B0007QQW4U,"If you enjoy David Wilcox music and you are an intermediate guitar player yourself, you will get a lot out of this dvd.  It is filmed like a personal session with David Wilcox showing you how to tune and finger a few of his songs.  I enjoyed it very much just watching it the first time.  Now I am in the process of learning some of the fingerings for some of my favorite songs.",1206835200,3,378,4.081081081081081
8050808,4,B0007QQW4U,THis is probably one of the most approachable title you'll find if you're trying to learn about alternate tunings.,1188950400,,114,5.052631578947368
8050809,5,B0007QQW4U,"This is a great DVD for those interested in Wilcox's playing. He is an excellent guitarist and teacher. He breaks down his songs very well, and has alot of interesting things to say. Well worth the money!",1142380800,3,204,4.54054054054054
