8675539,1,B00N1957PA,"The Laurel & Hardy ""amazing silent film era"" dvd (actually it's a dvd-r) seems to be a pirated rip off of the now out of print ""Lost Films of L&H"" dvd's. I can tell because even the newly made soundtrack (these are silent films) is exactly the same, and Habeas Corpus features the recently found long lost ""sound on disc"" music and effects soundtrack that was recently discovered, and that one has only been issued by Image Entertainment on those ""Lost Films"" dvd's. I'm surprised that 3rd parties can just sell their pirated copies through amazon!",1419811200,16,548,4.71875
