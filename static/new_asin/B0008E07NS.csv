The way that he can make me laugh with physical comedie is amazing. His timing is always perfect and the quality of these films is very high, considering they are from 1917. I also liked the music they choose to use with the shorts.",1148428800,,402,4.302631578947368
8055649,5,B0008E07NS,"''After watching this delightful mosaic (Charlie Chaplin Film Fest) of Chaplin's best feature films, feel inspired to tell you that one of India's most famous actors - Raj Kapoor - based almost his entire career on the portrayed characters. The Film Fest accurately captures Charlie Chaplin's comic genius. A2ZCDS - a big thank you""",1146528000,,332,5.166666666666667
8055650,5,B0008E07NS,"The best clip on this set is Chaplin as ""The Immigrant."" He is hysterical and you can see him developing into the huge star that he would later become.

Please note - these are early chaplin films and not the later ones that most people have seen. I loved them because they let me see how Chaplin developed as a comic persona. Obviously if you are looking for the classic Chaplin you will be surprised.

His talent is obvious in the clips and it's like watching a sketch being drawn of one of your favorite paintings.",1146441600,,517,4.375
8055651,4,B0008E07NS,"Chaplin only did 4 films in 1917, all for Mutual.  And these as well as others can be found on another DVD set called THE CHAPLIN MUTUALS from Image Entertainment.  I recommend that set as it is restored from 35mm nitrate originals.  This set is questionable.

(The following description came from the distributor)

This compilation of four magnificent Charlie Chaplin films from 1917 has Charlie at his hilarious best as he plays
1) an immigrant,  (THE IMMIGRANT - my guess)
2) an escaped convict,  (THE ADVENTURER - my guess)
3) an incurable inebriate  (THE CURE - my guess)
4) and a hopeless derelict.  (EASY STREET - my guess)

His regular co-stars Edna Purviance , Eric Campbell and Henry Bergman fill in with various supporting roles.
Charlie's portrayal of bumbling characters that are seldom out of trouble has the audience in splits. His inimitable acting style and trademark attire - undersized hat, inseparable walking stick, oversized shoes and a suit that all tailors would readily disown - have created a special place for Charlie in the minds of millions of fans the world over.",1128902400,2,1093,4.923497267759563
