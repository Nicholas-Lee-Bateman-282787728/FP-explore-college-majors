5697474,5,B00C888PB8,"In my opinion, The Retirement Gamble is one of Frontline's most interesting documentaries, as well as one of it's most useful.  It's useful because it discusses investment wisdom, in contrast to market hype. So you can consider it a primer on stable, retirement funding. It  argues, persuasively, that low cost index funds as the long term best bet.

It also digs into the retirement systems of most Americans, specifically the larger than expected fees of 401(k)s and mutual funds by many in the financial services industry.  It discusses the incentives of many ""financial advisers"", a title that doesn't have a concrete definition.  It compares those with a fiduciary duty (fee based) to those who work on portfolio sales (commission).  This raises the important question, ""Is this person compensated in a way that motivates them to look after 'my' interests?""

While not sensationalist, it's eye opening in its reporting that so many Americans are not property preparing retirement.  And of those that are saving well, many aren't aware of the array of fees and costs imposed on their retirement plans. It's not easy to find these costs.  As of my writing of this review, the retirement system is far from transparent.",1398470400,3,1221,5.065
5697475,5,B00C888PB8,"I have ordered this DVD as I am a Baby Boomer myself and am curious. I am acquiring as much information as I possibly can but if what is implied in this DVD there very well become a revolution of sorts in the US and in other Western Countries. There seems to be  a danger implied that perhaps some of the funds will be taken to run a broken economy. If that transpires we may very well have the very first uprising in Modern History against against a free new world Govt. So sad but possible, for the sake of out Grandchildren let's hope this does not transpire.",1388275200,,562,4.203703703703703
5697476,5,B00C888PB8,"Journalist tries to find the fees charged to his retirement savings, and is unable to tally the amounts due to hidden monthly charges: administrative, transaction (posting interest, dividends earned from savings), RMD required minimum distribution fees, charges for each stock bond fund each time a withdrawal is posted as it is spread across the entire account.

He discovers many others' retirement accounts are gutted by fees because they did not LOOK at their statements carefully. And the did not ask the important questions ""are you my fiduciary?"" meaning ""is the advice you give me for MY financial benefit, are there legal repercussions if the advice benefits YOU financially and NOT me?"" hidden charges, fees, bonuses paid to the broker for pushing funds being sold by the brokerage. Many individuals interviewed for this documentary discovered that their savings was decimated by fees and they did not have what they thought they did for retirement.

1992 hardback, 1993 paperback [ASIN:B0040IDAB4 Your Money Or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship With Money And Achieving Financial Independence] is Joe Dominguez' account of twice gaining and losing fortunes in the stock market, then inheriting $30,000 in the 1960s and deciding never to work again. He became financially independent by tracking every penny he spent, marking it on a graph each month. And tracking how much INCOME he received from his savings (interest, dividends, found penny on sidewalk). Over 5 years the two curves crossed, his expenditures equaled his income from savings.

Others wanted to know how he accomplished this feat. Dominguez was not wealthy but he didn't need to work unless he wanted to. He gave lectures, always paying his own travel expenses, and donating his fees to a foundation which donated all profits each year to charitable organizations which he supported. Since he didn't want to work, and speaking is work, he wrote Your Money or Your Life and donated the profits to the foundation as well. PBS followed up with two specials&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Affluenza/dp/B0009X3IDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Affluenza</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Affluenza/dp/B0009WYVUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Affluenza</a>&nbsp;about the infectious quality of spending on unneeded, unwanted gazingus pins (stuff which doesn't contribute to quality of life, and subtracts from savings for retirement).

One of my professors has a son and wife who are documented in Dominguez' book. Sadly Dominguez died of cancer. His book has been updated by someone else and I do not know that the profits of the new version of the book continue to flow to the charitable foundation Dominguez established as was true of the original 1992 hardback. I recommend the 1992 hardback or 1993 paperback first edition only.

My question: are 401(k) fees justified? Does the advice improve my decision making? Improve the investment income on retirement savings? or just deplete the savings from my work?

There is a saying that the health of the Japanese economy depends on the frugality of the Japanese housewife. In America 80% of spending decisions are made by the wife. What about the savings decisions?
