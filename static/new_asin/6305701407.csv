8148255,1,6305701407,"I reveiwed this dvd tonight to show to my children's Sunday School class. As others have said, it is inaccurate. I'm all for creative liberty as long as it does not depart from Scripture, but this is way off base. During the entire story, Moses' half brother, pharoah, is never in charge--their grandfather is. It shows Moses going out and his half-brother following him in disguise and sees Moses talking to God in a burning bush with a staff that turns to a snake. In Exodus, this does not happen until after Moses flees Egypt for killing an Egyptian (which it does not show). God gives Moses power and says for him to use it wisely. So throughout the plaques, Moses waves his magical staff to start and stop plaques. Many of the plaques are not mention and mold infestation is not one of them. Moses is placed on house arrest by his Pharoah grandfather, and Moses recants the killing of the first born (actually its portrayed as a fever is some of the children). As already mentioned, Moses and his half-brother partner together to lead the ""30-50"" slaves out of Egypt, which we know were thousands upon thousands. There is sarcasm, lots of use of the word ""stupid"" and sometimes ""idiot."" My kids were saying to throw the dvd away too! I do not recommend this dvd.",1313798400,,1267,4.56140350877193
8148256,1,6305701407,"The real story is found in the book of Exodus, the first 14 chapters. The story portrayed on this video/DVD has the same central human figure (Moses) and the same setting (Egypt) but the rest of it is quite imaginative and does not agree with the truth.
While I always encourage students to use their imaginations, it is hard to understand how someone could write a story like this and still market it as the story of Moses. Although it's told well and is interesting, it's not simply adding creative material to the story as written.
I will be joining those who are throwing away their copies. If you've already bought this, take a good look before letting your children watch it. If you're looking for a good Moses movie, the Prince of Egypt one is much more accurate.",1043193600,2,770,4.546762589928058
8148257,1,6305701407,"I bought this movie for my children, just to have a similar story told in a different way.  Well, it was more than different - it was WAY off base.  The story totally departs from the Biblical account of the life of Moses - some of the plagues are different, the Egyptian ""brother"" (named Amun?) joins him and becomes repentant, finally helping Moses to lead the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt.  This is directly opposite of the Hebrew brother of Moses, named Aaron, joining Moses and working with him.  The use of the ""burning bush"" becomes very ""magical"" instead of a once in a lifetime encounter with God, and is used repeatedly throughout the movie, including the bush coming to Moses while he and Amun are in prison.
I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone else.  My 3rd grader said, ""Mom, we need to get rid of this movie.""  I guess that sums up the review right there, as we will be getting rid of this one!",1030060800,2,924,4.437869822485207
