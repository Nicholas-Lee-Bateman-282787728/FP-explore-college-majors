8082640,4,B000B73HFC,"I think we've heard all the positive things you can say about this album, so how about some negative? First of all, I find it interesting that the magazine that gave this album 3 stars and basically overlooked it (Rolling Stone) now has the biggest boner of any magazine. Give it a rest! ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" does not have the best solo ever, in fact, it's one of the worst Nirvana solos ever, just repeating the chorus again. Not to mention that this album is so overproduced Kurt Cobain couldn't even listen to it. There are some awesome songs on here and it was my introduction to grunge (well, this and Ednaswap) but there was much better grunge and a lot of it was done by Nirvana.",1229126400,2,691,4.40625
