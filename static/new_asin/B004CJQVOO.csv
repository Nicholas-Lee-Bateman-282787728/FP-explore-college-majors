4327611,4,B004CJQVOO,"A real surprise to me because it was far better than I expected.  Charlie Sheen (younger) as a friend and hero seemed hard to believe, yet he pulls it off.  Juliette Caton is a gem.  Her eyes and facial expressions speak volumes where no lines are needed.  You find yourself drawn to her and rooting for her, especially against the bully girls in the orphanage.  Yes, hard to believe at times, but overall I would say a very good story and engaging movie.  Not just for kids, this movie has a message for adults as well.  I hope Ms. Caton does more acting in the states.  She has some foreign movies to her credit that I've not seen.",1381104000,2,633,4.305084745762712

8423115,5,B004CJQVOO,"I bought this mainly for Courage Mountain, which I love.  I have watched both movies and although Escape to Grizzly Mountain is good, Courage Mountain is much better.",1487808000,,166,4.928571428571429
8423116,5,B004CJQVOO,"I can thank Jan Michael Vincent for me purchasing the dvd. He was in ""Escape to Grizzly Mountain"" briefly at the beginning. I enjoy watching Dan Haggerty (not as Grizzzly Adams in this story), Jack the bear and how they weave a time travel story from Native Americans.  The other movie ""Courage Mountain"" is a different story about Heidi (not played by Shirley Temple in this movie). I can say that some adult themes were included in the film which was a bit upsetting. I did however enjoy the little love story between Heidi and (an older) Peter. This is one of Charlie Sheen's better acting, he convinced me as the Peter character that there was a change in Peter's feelings about Heidi when she transforms into a beautiful young woman.",1482796800,,738,4.633587786259542

8423122,2,B004CJQVOO,"Escape To Grizzly Mountain:  Could definitely do without all the references to the spirit world and traveling through time.  That notwithstanding, the whole thing is pretty lame and not very believable.

Courage Mountain:  This wasn't terrible per se, but it has very little to do with any original Heidi movie.  She's older now and off to a boarding school.  Charlie Sheen as the now older sheep herd just isn't believable.  He was about 25 when this was made, but his character is supposed to be more like 17.  On the other hand, the Heidi character (and actress) is more like 14.  In addition to their being much closer in age in the original Heidi movies, any sort of love interest between a 25 year old and a 14 year old just doesn't come off--other than as perhaps a crush on her part, which I don't think is the movie's intention.  It's just awkward.",1441238400,2,857,4.542483660130719
