7801697,5,1933233036,"Nicely done documentary about the immigration movement from Europe. What people and families had to go through to find what they hoped was a better life in America. Emphasized the role Ellis Island played as new immigrants came. The screening process did sometimes split up families and ""un-acceptables"" were sent back. It is entirely in black and white, but the pictures are sharp and compelling. I bought it for our school library and I think it is appropriate for fourth grade and older.",1494460800,,490,4.9156626506024095

7801703,5,1933233036,"This documentary was used in conjunction with a Smithsonian traveling exhibit called, ""Journey Stories"" that was on display  at the Erickson Center for the Arts in the small Upper Peninsula community of Curtis, Michigan.  The story is told with real footage showing the hardships many of our ancestors faced to come to this country.  It is expertly narrated by Gene Hackman whose sensitive telling made me feel that he was in the room, sitting next to me, recounting the difficult journey these people made to come to America.  The video was shown to the students and adults who made their own journey field trips to visit the exhibit in our tiny town.  For the many, it was the first time they had heard the story, but for others, they shared poignant stories of relatives who had made the journey to America through Ellis Island.  ""Island of Hope Island of Tears"" was viewed by over 1200 visitors.  It is a profoundly moving account of an integral part of our county's history.",1394323200,9,979,4.723529411764706
