8631448,5,B00HB36ALC,"I don't have any idea why there are one star reviews on this.  It shows nature in its stunning beauty and glorifies God, who is the author of that beauty.  I suppose to the one who wants to be offended by God, anything that mentions him should get a one star review.",1438905600,,266,4.096153846153846

8631450,5,B00HB36ALC,"Its difficult to understand how customers could mistake this production of The Metamorphosis as a movie and/or a christian musical concert when the blu-ray/dvd cover, clearly shown on Amazon's website, states ""Royal Ballet"".

This is grotesque, unique, repellently brilliant original dance theater from Britain's Royal Ballet, based on Kafka's novella.  With a faultless cast and starring the Royal Ballet's incomparable Edward Watson as a very ordinary man transformed before our eyes into an extraordinary insect.  For his outstanding performance in The Metamorphosis, Watson received the coveted Olivier Award.  Bizarre but brilliant.",1421539200,5,637,5.967032967032967

8631453,1,B00HB36ALC,"This is not the movie you think it is. I purchased this to show to my students after reading the novel, and it is a christian musical concert! Definitely not anything remotely close to Kafka's novella. EXTREMELY disappointed with amazon.com",1412640000,6,240,5.025
