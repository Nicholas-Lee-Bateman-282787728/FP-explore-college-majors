7956587,4,B00005Y758,"Given the fact that Pedro Infante is still coming up as an actor, his part in this movie-although he is in most of the movie-lack the characteristics and charisma we've all learned to love from him.  The movie is still pretty decent, and I would still recommend it to anyone who is a true fan of the Mexican Cinema and Pedro Infante",1158537600,2,332,4.354838709677419
