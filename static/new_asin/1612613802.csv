7800424,4,1612613802,"Fr. Albert is a humorous, but very intelligent Franciscan. He explains simple habits to progress your prayer life in an entertaining style with real life expectations.  One woman in my group commented it was the best instructions on how to prayer she had ever heard. I love it and look forward to his presentation every week. It's perfect for small group study:  the video is 6 thirty minute presentations and the corresponding book is a super easy read. 33 short chapters (10 minute read)  with reflection questions after each.",1461456000,,528,4.910112359550562
7800425,2,1612613802,I am appalled that I paid 89.95 for Catching Fire Becoming Flame DVD and it didn't come with a book! My fault for assuming that the book was included. I wouldn't have purchased this item if I had realized that the book wasn't included.,1390521600,4,235,4.363636363636363
