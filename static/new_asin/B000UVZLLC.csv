8364282,1,B000UVZLLC,"I purchased this DVD because it had good reviews. Now I know that this DVD is a not the one for me. I am a visual learner and her live presentation consisted from her talk made me extremely bored.
I never expected learning feng shui from just presenter's talk. This DVD is cheaply made, like I said just plain talk. I really don't understand why so many good reviews for this; there were far more useful feng shui DVD out there compared to this (!)

I would never buy any products based on their reviews for now on.",1257984000,4,515,4.255102040816326

I have read numerous books on the subject, but have found nothing that is as clear and concise as this video.  The information is broken down into usable portions that are much easier to digest than some of the other media on the subject.  Alice's ""pillars of feng shui"" are easy to apply, and I must say I have felt the energy shift in my home!",1193270400,,413,4.269230769230769
