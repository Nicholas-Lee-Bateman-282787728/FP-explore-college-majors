6248460,5,B00I3RHVLS,"""Wild"" Bill Elliott has always been my second favorite western star after Charles Starrett. My favorite Wild Bill westerns were his first four under Larry Darmour productions done for Columbia Studios, followed by the equally excellent ""Wild Bill Saunders"" group of Westerns. The series he did partnering withTex Ritter were also a favorite. After leaving Columbia in the early 1940s to do the Wild Bill Elliott series with sidekick Gabby Hayes at Republic Studios, he really took off as an even bigger Saturday matinee favorite when he began portraying the famed ""Red Ryder"" character with sidekick, Robert Blake as ""Little Beaver"". I can still see Bill Elliott emerging from within the Oversized Red Ryder hardback with both guns blazing, and quickly reholstered. When Bill Elliott began casting in a series of detective movies with Allied Artists in the late 1950s, I found it to be an interesting transition trading his horse for an unmarked patrol car, investigating murder mysteries. This is a very nice set of Bill Elliott Detective movies which I found quite entertaining. Highly http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-AG811_HARLEM_G_20100609193223.jpgRecommended.",1408752000,10,1178,5.661016949152542

6248462,5,B00I3RHVLS,"In this Mysteries series from Allied Artists Pictures, Bill Elliott is rough as ever, but instead of looking like the cowboy with boots and spurs, he is a well-dressed, comparatively sophisticated-looking man in the large twentieth-century Los Angeles County. In some ways, the physical attributes in the movies of this mystery series are similar: there are fist-fights and gun fights. On the other hand, there are some differences. Again, Bill Elliott (as Lt. Andy Flynn in the first movie and then as Lt. Andy Doyle in the subsequent films) is nicely and professionally dressed in dark suit, dark necktie, and white shirt. Character-wise, he is as rough, low-keyed, and awe-inspiring as in any of his previous westerns. In the last three films of this series. The short and stocky tough-guy character actor Dan Haggerty gives strong  support as his partner Sgt. Mike Duncan in the last three of these films. And in all the films he is also given support by cast members Helene Stanley, Keith Larsen, James Best, and Lyle Talbot, just to name a few. The films are attention-maintaining and exciting, and thus are worth the time to see them.",1405728000,13,1141,4.942708333333333
6248463,4,B00I3RHVLS,Great B run noir detective stories. 5 movies for the price of 2. Lotsa fun.and action.  Nice transfer.,1405123200,2,102,4.666666666666667
6248464,5,B00I3RHVLS,"As a faan of Bill Elliott films generally, I have been keen to get these 5 films for many years. Now, courtesy Warner Archive, these nice little films are available at last in great print quality.",1403654400,3,196,4.472222222222222
6248465,4,B00I3RHVLS,"For the reason stated above I bought this set to see how ""Wild Bill"" fared having swapped his western garb for ""civvies"". The set, as with others purchased, arrived in good condition and picture and sound quality were both first class. Now these films are almost 60 years old and were shot with a minimal budget so, with running times of 65 minutes or less, don't expect complicated plots or in depth characterisations. Nor should you look for CSI forensics, these films were made in the days whereby the case was solved by the heroes instinct and hunches. Having said all that, I enjoyed sitting back and watching this undemanding fare. A good exercise in seeing how you don't need to spend lots of cash to make little thrillers like these",1402617600,5,740,4.656488549618321
6248466,4,B00I3RHVLS,In some ways reminded me of the old black and white Dragnet episodes. If you enjoy B-Movies this is worth it.,1402531200,,109,4.238095238095238
6248467,5,B00I3RHVLS,"Actually good detective movies of the time.  Elliott did a great job and so different from the Westerns he had done previously.  If you are a Wild Bill Elliott fan, this is a must have for your collection.",1399334400,5,205,4.368421052631579
6248468,5,B00I3RHVLS,"This set of five detective stories from the 1950s starring western star Bill Elliott ,is a little gem in so many ways, and is beautifully
packaged and presented. Elliott is a very nice surprise as a lieutenant in the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department solving
interesting crimes in a laid back, no nonsense manner. Nice to watch him work in his slow and confident  style without all the modern
wham bam frenzy of movement and noise that dominate modern day police shows.
Some nice supporting actors do their thing and the direction is tight and unfussy. Marlin Skiles music plays a big part in moving each
show along.
I enjoyed every minute of this DVD and have just ordered an Elliott western to watch him in action out from behind a desk and on a horse !
Top marks to Warners for this release. More of the same please.....",1395360000,31,828,4.557046979865772
6248469,4,B00I3RHVLS,"Wild Bill Elliott as he was known in his western films ended his career at Monogram Pictures with five mystery films in modern day adventures.  These films were made in the mid to late 1950'S.  It seemed strange to see Bill driving a car rather chasing down the bad guys astride his horse ""Stormy"".  His real name was Gordon Nance but changed it to Elliott for films.  These five entries were well produced and Bill did an excellent acting job.  I would recommend this five DVD collection for your collection.",1394755200,20,509,4.611111111111111
6248470,5,B00I3RHVLS,"Bought these after reading some reviews and was not disappointed. These are very enjoyable movies to watch and Bill Elliot shines in them. One thing I like about many of these old detective shows is the outside locations they shot them in. In many cases, you get to see the cities and towns as they looked back then, along with the classic cars. That aside, though, these are very well made movies and worth the price.",1420070400,5,418,4.5131578947368425
6248471,5,B00I3RHVLS,These are solid police/mystery films. Enjoyed them very much.,1416873600,,61,5.888888888888889
6248472,4,B00I3RHVLS,"I never knew Wild Bill Elliott did a police procedural series for Allied Artists during the late 1950s. Wild Bill was a peaceable man, which he would tell you in many Westerns  just before he slugged you senseless. Wild Bill wore often wore his guns backwards in their holsters, as Guy Madison did in the early 1950s television series Wild Bill Hickok.

I get the impression that if your name was Bill you were naturally nicknamed Wild, and you wore guns backwards, which really looked pretty cool, if not practical.

Warner Archive Collection has preserved the five Bill Elliot Detective Mysteries (which I never knew existed) in sharp clear, black and white, widescreen prints.

The company is doing an impeccable job of preserving these small films that might have been lost forever.

Some of you are asking by now what in the hell the title of this piece has to do with these police procedurals.

You may be thinking: Don suckered us in here, but I don't see hide nor hare of Sam Peckinpah.

The manhunt takes characters to a Nays burger stand that I wish I could stop by today. Its picturesque and unique, and hopefully a few of these places still exist.

Who should be dishing out the dialogue and the fast food intake?

Thats right. Sam Peckinpah.

I love this movie poster ad line for Bill Elliott's Police Detective series:
THE RACKET THE COPS MAY NEVER BEAT...
AS LONG AS WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL
AND MEN ARE WEAK.

You can read the entire piece, with many Links and photos,
on my RIDING SHOTGUN column on the DVD release.
Hope you enjoy it.

6248473,3,B00I3RHVLS,I purchased this set because I am a fan of Bill Elliott in his western years and didn't recall him as a detective in the early years of TV. I found them to be mildly entertaining and interesting because of the people in the cast who were just beginning their careers and went on to achieve varying degrees of success in later years.,1415750400,,332,4.285714285714286
6248474,3,B00I3RHVLS,"Bill Elliott went through a character metamorphosis during his film career. He began in the 1930s billed (when it happened) as Gordon Elliott and seen mostly as inconsequential characters in tuxedos in lesser Warner Bros fare. Moving on to Columbia Pictures later in the 30's, he became Bill Elliott co-starring with Tex Ritter in Saturday matinee westerns. Without Ritter he was starred in two Columbia western serials, one as Wild Bill Hickok. Then Republic contracted him for a western series billed as Wild Bill Elliott. He was still Wild Bill Elliott in a series of Red Ryder westerns. Next Republic renamed him William Elliott and starred him in a series of big budget color westerns. Moving next in the 1950s to Allied Artists (read cheap Monogram Pictures) for a short-lived series of westerns and modern day police tales. Warner Bros. released what they call Bill Elliott Mysteries, four 65-minute and less in length. Less mystery than procedural in tone, Elliott portrays a lieutenant in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. In the first he is Andy Flynn, then in next three for some unexplained reason he is Andy Doyle, but always the same character. Filmed in 1954-57, content-wise, the films, though well-acted, are tame compared to what was happening in bigger budget films and on TV in those days. However, these films were designed to play in small town theaters across America and back then there were prolific racking up studio profits. Call these Guilty Pleasure movies and enjoy.",1412985600,2,1500,5.05241935483871

Low end Allied Artists time-killers but if you like Bill Elliott and you like a lot of familiar faces and, most important of all, if you go in with low expectations you might have a good time. Sometimes they're so lame you might get a few laughs but don't buy them for that reason.",1410566400,,301,4.298245614035087
6248479,3,B00I3RHVLS,"If you liked him as ""Wild Bill Elliot"" in all of those ""hayburners"" then you might like this series.  Elliott in my view is not much of a actor more like actor thrown into westerns because of his looks and they needed a guy who looked a hero.  These movies are at the end of his cowboy career when he and his studio hoped that ""Mysteries"" would keep them going just like all those cowboy movies did.",1409875200,4,399,4.1688311688311686
8638804,5,B00I3RHVLS,"Being a 68 year old Baby Boomer I know who ""Wild Bill Elliott"" is because of seeing his westerns on t.v. as a kid growing up in the 50's. I have been a movie lover from the time that I was a kid. I had no idea that Elliott made a series of detective movies in the 50's. I recently bought the collection of those five crime movies and I must say that he certainly did outshine Jack Webb from Dragnet. This series of movies are a definite must have for all lovers of movies, both old and new. All five are in glorious black and white.",1483574400,3,532,3.9813084112149535

8638806,5,B00I3RHVLS,Wild Bill Eliot as a modern detective was really a switch but it worked. A must to see and definitely worth the money,1450569600,,117,4.130434782608695

If you are looking for the ""I'm just a peaceable guy"" Bill Elliott he isn't here.  These movies were shot on a shoestring budget, with very cheap sets, and not such a great supporting cast.  The stories are just okay at best, and Elliott does what he can with the material he has been given.

However, in his early period the thirties under Gordon Elliott he was in drama plays until the 1940's when he play Red Ryder that he was billed as ""Wild Bill"".  After he stopped doing westerns in 1953 and was asked to do a detective series.  I was strange for me to see Wild Bill Elliott change from western duds to regular street clothes for a series of five crime dramas.
