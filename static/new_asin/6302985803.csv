I can't stand Soap Operas or anything similar. low rating for the horrible ""serious"" acting. 4-5 for the sleazy stuff.",1267920000,,265,5.045454545454546

7835699,3,6302985803,"I was never a huge fan of the first ""Body Chemistry""  and this made me not want to see the first sequel.  However, I was intrigued by this entry into the already rather bland series (as erotic thrillers go, they're a tease at best, since they don't come in UNRATED editions), not only for the presences of Andrew Stevens (the hottie king of erotic smut) and Morgan Fairchild, but for the plot.
For those who don't know (and there are probably a lot who fit that category), ""Point of Seduction's"" plot revolves around a TV Producer named Alan Clay (Stevens) and his wife Beth Chaney (Fairchild), a soap star on a trashy nighttime soap called ""Empire.""  Beth is looking for a magnum opus role for TV that her fans will truly remember her for, while Alan wants a production he can really sink his teeth into.
Alan hires an aspiring writer named Freddie(?) to write a script about the story of Dr. Clare Archer, a possible sociopathic radio psychiatrist who has been stalked by two of her former lovers.  These supposed stalkings resulted in both their deaths.  Of course, these are the two previous entries in the series.
Clare (this time played by Sherri Sattuck) objects at first, but after a night of steamy lovemaking with Alan in a hotel room after the power goes out, she gives into his ideas.  And the usual trouble ensues.  Is she a temptress in distress, or a heartless, bitchy murderess (gasp!)
It was SO much fun watching this corny flick, because the actors try to be so serious, but instead are wooden, melodramatic, and ultimately unconvincing.  But it was intentional, to an extent, I'm sure.  Also, the film was made by classic smut jockey Jim ""Remove Your Tops, Please, Ladies!"" Wynorski, who gave the late-night direct-to-video crowd other ""gems""  such as ""Sorceress,""  and ""Sins of Desire.""
Soap fans will undoubtedly enjoy this, as it is a tighter 90-minute version with a LOT of flesh you'll never see on TV!
Overall rating:  *** out of *****.",1016323200,22,1961,4.701754385964913
