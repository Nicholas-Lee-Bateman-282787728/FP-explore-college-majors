I applaud this film because it dares to be different. I'm tired of the high-concept low IQ drivel that Hollywood churns out. Who wants to go to a movie where you know the whole story and how its going to end after the first five minutes! The Dragon Gate with all its imperfections is still an engrossing cinematic ko'an. With each scene you're never sure what's going to happen next. Each obstacle that the hero encounters is symbolic of our modern life. In this sense the film resonates Joseph Campbell's mono-myth.
For those of you who found The Empire Strikes Back to have more meaning than Star Wars, The Return Of The Jedi, or The Phantom Menace, you will find much to enjoy about The Dragon Gate.
The photography is gorgeous. In fact the images are very imaginative, the film has a strong after-life, you just keep thinking about it!
If you're looking for a film that challenges you, I would recommend The Dragon Gate.",1013558400,,945,4.597633136094674
