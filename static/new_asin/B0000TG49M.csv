Chobits is a story that went form an interest to an addiction and finally an obsession for me in a matter of a week.  The series gives the viewer plenty of time to enjoy each character for their own traits.  Many of the middle episodes could be seen as fluff and filler.  But somehow in this story, all of the vacations, errands, idle chit-chat, and meals together create a broad snapshot of everyone's life together.  The viewer doesn't just get told that certain characters care for each other, it all gets acted out.  In doing so, the audience virtually becomes a member in this group of friends.
The series creates a delicate social environment between the main characters (Chi & Hideki) and all their friends.  The constant threat of destruction of this environment has kept me hooked from the beginning.  As the story nears it's end, the threat becomes more real.  Even Chi's ability to stay functioning has been at the mercy of the simple flick of a ""secret switch"".  What started as a simple perverted joke at the beginning, became the strongest example of the fragile nature of love and life.
The final episodes add a level of intensity above any typical love story.  Science-fiction aside, the love theme becomes very human and could be thought of as an allegory to many interracial relationships in our own world.  Anyone who has had a difficult time with family/friends accepting a relationship with differences (i.e. age, race, culture, language (personally, mine fits'em all)) could easily relate with Hideki.  Watching him deal with his conflicted feelings toward Chi hit home way too hard for me.
I've seen many comments on the web complaining about how predictable the ending was.  I admit, it may as well be, but it was still worth it.  Even after watching the entire series a second, third, fourth... time, I still find it impossible to maintain my composure in the end.  There is so much more to this series than knowing the ending.  The story is full of themes just begging to be understood and learned from.
The Chobits series is definitely one to watch together with someone you love.",1073952000,19,2200,4.777777777777778

1943031,5,B0000TG49M,"Volume 6! Could you believe what happened in Volume 5?!
If you thought Volume 5 started to get odd, wait 'til you see this DVD. The charecters you knew - changed. Things you thought could never happen - happened. Just wait, Chobits fans. You're in for a treat. ^___^",1068595200,8,266,4.448979591836735
8002508,5,B0000TG49M,"Chobits was one of the first animes I bought. I fell in love with it. The characters are very lovable. Chobits may be one of the cutest anime series ever. Chi is adorable. The animation is very good and the music fits the mood of the story beautifully. It's fun and very sweet, but it also gets extremely emotional at times. Every CLAMP title is great and Chobits is no exception. If you like Chobits check out these other CLAMP titles: X, Tsubasa, xxxHolic, and Angelic Layer. You would really be missing out if you don't watch Chobits.",1354147200,,537,4.489795918367347
8002509,5,B0000TG49M,"I didn't think I could love a series like this. Watching all the episodes have that had led up to the ending has made me very attatched to all the characters. I'm just glad it was a happy ending even though it breaks my heart to know it's over. But I'm sure Chii and Hideki are doing fine ^_^

sure the ending was predictable

But deep down thats how i wanted it to be

(i feel like a total softy for geting all misty eyed)",1127779200,,423,3.9529411764705884
8002510,4,B0000TG49M,"Chobits: Vol. 6: My Only Person contains the LAST FOUR episodes of the wonderful anime series Chobits produced by CLAMP studios.  I am sad to see this series come to an end, but I loved the ending.  I would SO love to see CLAMP produce a Chobits II: Followup.

Episode 23:  Chi Answers - Minoru, ""Dragonfly"" (Chi's repentant and chastisted kidnapper), and a bevy of Persocoms are hard at work trying to discover Chi's origin once and for all.  It is fairly certain Chi is one of the legendary ""Chobits,"" but in seeking confirmation, Minoru's favorite Persocom, Yuzuki, is damaged in a hacking attempt.  In exploring the nature of Minoru and Yuzuki's relationship, Hideki starts to analyze his true feelings toward Chi.

Episode 24:  Chi Decides - This episode is mostly about Yumi, and her past relationship with Hiroyasu Ueda, the bakery manager where Chi works.  As revealed in a previous episode, Ueda was deep in love with and actually married to a Persocom.

Episode 25:  Chi Puts on and Takes Off - The true origins of Chi and Freya (Dark Chi)are revealed here.  Hideki tries to confess his feelings to Chi.  But the two mysterious Persocoms have decided to act, because Chi poses great danger to all Persocoms.

Episode 26:  The Only Person for Chi - Chi activates, with glowing eyes.  Dita tries to stop Chi.  What will happen to Chi and Hideki?

Note: There IS a volume 7 for the series - but don't get excited!  There is little, if any new material on it.  The volume, called ""Chat Room"" consists of three recap episodes.  There is a cute short involving the two mini Persocoms, but if you are looking for new material, there is very little.",1114905600,3,1651,4.643598615916955
8002511,5,B0000TG49M,"I agree with the other reviewers who have said that ""My Only Person"" is *much* different than most of the other Chobits DVDs.  Particularly of note is the tone of urgency that runs through the episodes, and the two new characters Zima and Dita (who have been deep in the backgriound until now).

The characters get a ""makeover""-- a new layer of complexity that adds to their appeal and draws away from the frequent ""cardboardness"" of quite a few anime characters.

These characters have evolved through this series; even Dragonfly (the formerly one-dimensional, opportunistic hacker) has grown to become less ""villainlike"".  Yumi (the young student who helps Hideki get a job at My Pleasure) is less perky and more realistic.  And even Chi literally reveals a definitely ""different"" side of herself, which we have gotten brief hints of even in some of the early episodes.

My only (tiny) complaint is that more of the changes in the episodes of Disk 6 could have been explored a bit earlier;  as it is, the details are rushed over as the story ends, which disturbs the slow, easy pace established early in the series.  Not a huge problem, to be sure, but enough to jar the viewer slightly and make them wonder what's going on.

The ending is very well executed; it will make you cry at first, and then, after a while, you will be happy.

My only regret is, now I'll have to find another addictive series to get into. LOL!",1106438400,4,1421,4.648
8002512,5,B0000TG49M,"wow I'm not the kind of person who cries with a movie or any romantic stuff but I dropped a tear watching the ending of chobits(specially the part where I though chii was going to lose....well i don't want to spoil)...Anyway, what a great series, I didn't want to give chobits a try at the begining cause it didn't have magic or mechas and all that but it was definetely worth it and now is My favorite series of all time....  I want More!!",1094515200,,440,4.238095238095238
8002513,5,B0000TG49M,"The whole DVD just basically wrapped up the whole series and ended. It was a little abrupt, and I thought they could've took more time and made a better ending.
But, it is still the best ending I've ever seen... Hideki finally shows his feelings for Chii and... I'll leave the rest for you to see!
A few notes for the last DVD... yes... there are a few mature stuff... probably 14-16 and up. Other than that, it is pretty decent... I mean... PERFECT!",1083801600,,450,4.369047619047619
8002514,5,B0000TG49M,oh my gosh!  i was so shocked by the ending.  i cried like a little baby.  i was confused at first but then every thing made sense and then i cried even more.  i loved Chobits from the first episode and i love it til the last.,1074643200,3,226,3.74468085106383

The characters have changed so much since the beginning, and its great to see what they've become at the end!!  This is just an all-around great show for anyone who likes romance/comedy.",1074470400,5,362,4.507692307692308
