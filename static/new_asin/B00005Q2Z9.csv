7949525,5,B00005Q2Z9,"I was a devout fan from a young age and Cartoon Network NEVER SHOWED the last three episodes on this DVD. If you are a fan of the American dub or could only watch it on TV, this is perfect. This DVD gave me the answers that I wanted to know for a long time. I also must admit that after one watches the show in the original Japanese, they will never want to go back to the American dub.",1258329600,,386,3.8375
7949526,5,B00005Q2Z9,"What can I say... other then that it is 2008, I am in my mid 20's and I still love everything about Sailor Moon. If you enjoyed watching Sailor Moon in the mornings... early 90's, then you will enjoy all the Edited VHS videos.",1218758400,,226,4.159090909090909
7949527,5,B00005Q2Z9,"I want to watch this so bad, especially if it has Sailor Saturn in it! I haven't seen any SM movies that have SS. I'm a writer and I'm writing a collection of SM books. I've made Dreamcatcher parts 1 and 2 (Dark Moon Circus), The Battle For Earth (Galaxia, Iron Mouse, and Aluminum Siren), and right now I'm writing Bad For Good (Wicked Lady, Wiseman, Diamond, and Rubueaus). I'm planning on writing a book called Decepitation that has Fiore in it. The reason why it's called Decepitation is because if you've seen SM R, Tuxedo Mask is friends with the innocent Fiore but he's actually evil. I'm gonna try to make SS one of the main characters.",1113436800,2,644,4.466101694915254

7949529,4,B00005Q2Z9,"I think the cover of this movie is probley one of the many SM movie covers that I like[considering the fact that sailor saturn is my 100% favorite sailor scout, even more than sailor moon and I just think she looks plain cool on the cover]. And a little note here to sailor moonies:
BEFORE YOU GET THE AWAKENING, PURCHASE THIS MOVIE !! THERE IS SOME VALUBLE INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT AFTER YOU WATCH THIS THAT WILL NOT MAKE YOU CONFUSED IN THE AWAKENING.
In the first episode, the heart snatchers come up with a new idea to steal pure hearts.
In the second episode, the girls to Mugen school so Amy can take an exam, and the girls look around for any work of negative forces.
In the third episode, the sailor scouts defeat the last member of the witches 5. And mistress 9 awakens! I'll let you guess why.",1054684800,2,816,4.339869281045751

7949531,5,B00005Q2Z9,"This video is wonderful.  The Saturn pic on the front is really cool-looking.
This is about the last of the Witches 5 (Uitsuchusu 5)Teruru, Birui, and Shipurin&Pichiroru.  Watch the gradual build-up to the Messiah of Silence's (Chinmoku no Meshiyaa) awakening!
!That's all!",1025913600,2,273,5.476190476190476
7949532,5,B00005Q2Z9,I don't like the Japanese version. It has that sleeping pill song Tuxedo Mirage. Overall Support Sailor Moon! Enjoy the show!,1008979200,,125,5.0
