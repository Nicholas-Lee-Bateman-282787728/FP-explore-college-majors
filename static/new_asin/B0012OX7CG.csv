8247036,4,B0012OX7CG,This was a gift for my lady who loves cats. Just a simple thing but it put a smile on her face. I didn't see it personally but she liked it so it was well worth it!,1389312000,,164,3.4594594594594597
8247037,3,B0012OX7CG,"I bought this DVD along with Science of Cats from National Geographic, which focuses on a program led by geneticists at the University of California at Davis to find the country where cats originated. They concluded that cats originated in Egypt. World of Cats accepts that conclusion, but Science of Cats gives detailed information on the search using DNA analysis. I prefer that DVD, but both are useful.",1365120000,,406,4.985294117647059
8247038,5,B0012OX7CG,I enjoyed this two part video.  The narrator is very well informed on the history of cats and their unique behaviors.,1355875200,,117,4.571428571428571
8247039,1,B0012OX7CG,"I was hoping for more of a documentary style.  Mr. Tabor knows his cats, but not how to present his information in an interesting manner.  Very disappointed in this purchase.",1333756800,4,174,4.766666666666667
8247040,2,B0012OX7CG,"Our son loves cats so I bought this set of DVDs and we watched it together.  Roger Tabor might be an expert on cats but he sure bored the world out of us.  We expected to see cats during his narration but we only saw Mr. Tabor walking, sitting, talking in front the camera... finally we saw a few seconds of a cute cat, then we found ourselves looking at Mr. Tabor again!  His monotone literally put our son to sleep.  After our son went to bed I thought I could watch a bit more but I too lost interest within 10 minutes.  To add insult to injury, the picture quality of the movies is subpar.

This is not a bad DVD set. But you will have to be a die-hard cat lover to endure all four episodes.",1332806400,8,695,4.0
