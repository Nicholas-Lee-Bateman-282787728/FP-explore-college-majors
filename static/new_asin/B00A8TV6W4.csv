Utada Hikaru has always been one of my favorite Japanese artists and I was absolutely ecstatic when discovering that she was going to release a PV of her successful digital hit ""Sakura Nagashi"". And from watching the PV for the first time, I can say it was interesting at least. I mean, if you're looking for an exciting PV that screams awesomeness, I am here to tell you that this PV will not live up to your expectations. To some, this PV will be dreadfully boring; to others it might be the most beautiful PV you're ever witnessed!

For me, it was exceptional. I just love the simple, elegant pictures of nature she presents to her audience. The video focuses on the concepts of motherhood in a ""universal light"". Quite an interesting interpretation if you ask me.

Even though it's a simple video, the lyrics themselves make up for it. I just love how the lyrics focus on the ideas of love and motherhood. A beautiful visualization from Utada.

Although it isn't the best video in the world, I can appreciate the simple message Utada was trying to convey to her audience.",1361664000,3,1209,4.532110091743119
