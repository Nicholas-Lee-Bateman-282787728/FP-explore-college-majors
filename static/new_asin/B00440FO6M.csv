4258340,5,B00440FO6M,"I loved the books and loved the films so am thinking of getting this.
Just want to confirm that these are the extended versions. The total running time given for this boxset appear to indicate it is so.

The Millennium films have been released in Denmark in their original form as TV series. The running times for each tv version indicated as follows:-

The 1st BR is 202 minutes
The 2nd BR is 156 minutes
The 3rd BR is 184 minutes
That equals to 542 minutes - about the same as indicated for this set.

Can anyone confirm this?
Thanks",1291161600,6,535,4.33
4258341,5,B00440FO6M,"If you've read the books you'll LOVE this movie trilogy.  I doubt the Hollywood version currently being made will even come close to the rawness of this movie.  If your favorite character is Lisbeth, then actress Noomi Rapace hits the mark.  The first movie wasn't dubbed, but I'm glad they're dubbed now. It allows you to follow the movie much easier.",1289692800,11,352,4.737704918032787
4258342,5,B00440FO6M,"The late Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy was all about cruelty towards women -- and the movie adaptations don't hold back either. These are bleak, dark thrillers filled with razor-sharp social commentary, bloody action and conspiracies -- and brilliant performances by Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.

In ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstrm.

Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. He's offering evidence on Wennerstrm, so Mikael has no choice but to accept -- and as he investigates the sinister Vanger family, he joins forces with Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), an eccentric, abused computer hacker. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.

""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" finds Mikael investigating sex trafficking in his own country, and young girls who are sold into it. Unknown to him, Lisbeth is keeping very close tabs on his work -- especially since she was abused as a child, and now plots revenge on the sex traffickers. But when she's accused of murder and ends up on the run, Mikael must discover what lies at the core of these crimes...

And finally, ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest"": Lisbeth has been shot in the head, her malevolent father Zalachenko is in the same hospital claiming that she tried to kill him, and some nasty government forces want her locked away, as she was as a child. Her only hope lies in Mikael, who must unravel a government conspiracy formed around the young hacker...

""The Stieg Larsson Trilogy"" takes the usual mystery/thriller plots and promptly turns them on their heads. They take place in a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- and no one more so than the eccentric, angry ""girl with the dragon tattoo.""

And the movies translate Larsson's novels beautifully. Niels Arden Oplev gives a raw, bone-chilling power to the first movie; Daniel Alfredson doesn't have quite the same kinetic touch, but both men do brilliant jobs with their films. And they weave in some horribly disturbing scenes (the ghastly, helpless rape of Lisbeth by her corrupt ""guardian"" -- followed by a gleefully horrific scene where she gets her revenge).

And Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- Nyquist's journalist starts world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, but regains his passion for the truth. And Rapace is absolutely electric as Lisbeth, who is one of the most devastatingly brilliant characters in modern cinema -- she's a wild, bleeding creature hiding her bruises behind a mask of piercings and jet-dyed hair, and whose torn-up heart begins to heal when she meets Mikael.

""The Steig Larsson Trilogy"" is a powerful trio of movies that never stops hitting you in the gut when you least expect it. Absolutely brilliant.",1287878400,122,3116,5.1200787401574805

I have not read the books but let's face it, No one is producing a 30 hour movie to stay absolutely true to the written version, If you want to watch are really good movie, this is the version to watch in my opinion. The US remake is ""good"" but only is the first of the three and it would not appear that the other two will ever be produced. Rooney Mara performs well in the US version but the overall movie really does not hold a candle to Noomi Rapace and the rest of the supporting cast.

I am not a big fan of dubbing but the English dubbing in my opinion was done very well. Of course the lip syncing is off somewhat but I did not detect any noticeable instances where voices continued after the lips stopped moving. I did watch the English subtitled version after the dubbed version and I found both versions done very well.
Unfortunately Stieg Larsson passed away before writing more sequels and his estate did release two more books based on Lizbeth later. I still find this a very well made and executed movie.",1520121600,,660,4.689655172413793

4258423,3,B00440FO6M,"so... not sure where to start here. These are well acted, well made, and interesting movies... shortened TV series made into movies... whatever you want to call them. Noomi Rapace is outstanding as Lisbeth. That said, this series parts from the book in many, many ways. Now, I don't want to be your typical ""the movie isn't as good as the book"" snob, who is really just trying to humble brag that they actually took the time to read the book. But, this series alters aspects of the books plot, or, more specifically, the character development.. in weird ways that don't do anything to add to the plot, don't condense the story to fit the time limit, and seemingly don't serve ANY function other than to make this dark book trilogy more bland.  I'm not sure why they made the changes they did, but quite honestly as someone who has read the book(s), watched this series, and seen the Hollywood movie with Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig, if you aren't going to read the book, get the hollywood version. It doesn't stick to the book either, but IN MY OPINION it develops the characters more accurately and you won't have to read subtitles the whole time.  Now bring on the people telling me I'm crazy...",1484179200,,1198,4.567441860465117

4258438,5,B00440FO6M,"I find the acting in the Swedish series much better than that in the American movie.  Even though you can have the actors 'speak' English, I prefer to play in Swedish and read the subtitles --I am not fond of the movement of the mouth not matching the words.",1475107200,3,258,4.26530612244898
4258439,5,B00440FO6M,"This is the impressive made-for-Swedish-TV series of three films dating from 2011 and in the original language with subtitle options. These offer the full length films seen in the TV series and are not the shorter cinema release versions. Consequently they make far greater sense of the complex story-lines of the three substantial, gripping and award-winning books. This is obviously the version to buy.

The title role of Lisbeth Salander is convincingly played by Noomi Rapace and she is supported by Michael Nyqvist in the riole of Mikael Blomkvist. The remainder of the various casts over the three films is, without exception, of the highest quality and the filming delivers on maintaining both drama and atmosphere over the whole extended time span.

In the interest of avoiding 'spoiling' the plot line nothing of that need be added. The books have been absolute best sellers and offer a considerable amount of detail throughout which is unfailingly essential to fully understanding the plot and the characters and their motivations. The films largely keep to the books and offer a deeply satisfying alternative to the books. Nevertheless it is an alternative and reading the complete saga in book form is probably an imperative! The sequence will be a matter of personal choice or opportunity but logically and helpfully, it would seem to make more sense to read the full printed version before watching the films. In this way it will be easier to follow the areas where short-cuts are made within the re-telling.

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this set.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this TV series the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers a technically successful product.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The BD transfers offer firm colours and there is a satisfying perceived depth of imaging. The whole set simply becomes more 'real.' The series, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality. The soundtrack is convincingly 'real' too.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD.

In summary this BD set offers a transfer from good quality 2011 film stock and enthusiasts should find it both essential and rewarding to buy.",1475020800,,3578,5.183708838821491

There are two sets of DVDs reviewed here -- a short one and a long one. As far as I can tell, there's no real way to tell the difference. I bought the short one when it was the only thing available, back when I just got out of the hospital -- I was a computer geek with a brain injury. (Lizbeth recovered a lot faster than I did :-)

I bought the long one when it became available, but I can't find it anymore. So I wanted to replace it. I couldn't tell, from the Amazon web site, which one this is. So I tried one, and I was lucky.

Amazon should delete all the reviews mentioning the short one and/or make it very clear what this is. There are 2 movies on each DVD, not just 1. The unchopped Swedish TV programs.

Larsson's Dragon Trilogy is at the top of that list.

I didn't want to believe anyone could make a film this thoroughly good...  and thoroughly scary... and disturbing too. And you won't fully understand the complexity of each character unless you see the full trilogy - just don't watch them all in one night!  As with many exciting & graphic thriller flicks, personal tragedies eventually lead to national issues and powerful figures get involved.

4258475,1,B00440FO6M,"Although the cast and story deserve 5 stars, this ""extended"" DVD set does NOT. First of all, it is MISSING many sequences that were in the original DVD set. I watched both versions just to be sure. The most critical omission is the escape of Paulo & Muriel from the burning building. You see the building totally engulfed in flames, then Paulo & Muriel magically appear in the hospital. My original DVD set clearly shows their escape. The whole scene with the big brother at the hospital is also missing. Why are scenes missing in an ""extended"" version? That's fraudulent advertising. A MOST ANNOYING flaw in the extended DVD set is that, even with subscripts turned off, certain subscripts remain on the screen long after the applicable event. That's very distracting in the story. On the plus side, the most important material this set ADDS to the story (compared to the original DVD set) is how the Constitutional Defense people were alerted and brought into the case in the first place. This was welcome detail. So, the original DVD set has material NOT in the extended version, the extended version has material NOT in the original DVD set, BOTH sets are incomplete.

4258508,5,B00440FO6M,"Noomi Rapace is an excellent Lisbeth Salander, though perhaps not as good as Rooney Mara in the Daniel Craig version of Dragon Tatoo, and this extended version is an excellent production.  It boosted Ms. Rapace to the top of her profession and her subsequent work has been outstanding as well.  If you only buy this set for the cinematography, it's an excellent value.  The scenery is worth it.  Larson's trilogy is a publishing marvel and this production does it justice.  After reading the books, the visuals really bring the story to life.  Make no mistake, like all European productions, this version does not rise to American production values in staging and scene sequencing, but it does an adequate job of presenting a massive work and keeps the story moving.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend; you'll be glad you did.",1450051200,,833,4.783216783216783
4258509,5,B00440FO6M,"Since it did not appear that there were going to be English version of the 2nd & 3rd books I decided to get the trilogy Swedish
release with all three movies.  After watching all three of the movies using the English dialog alone with closed captions (hearing impaired) I must say that I was very pleased.  The dialog was done in such a way that it did not seem phony although there were a couple of scenes with close up where you could tell the voices were dumbed.

I feel that the three movies pretty much followed the books even though there were some parts of the books that did not appear in the movies.  I think anyone would be hard pressed to find a movie that did not include everything that was included in the book.  Before seeing a movie I try to read the book since I am hearing impaired and sometimes have problems with the dialog.  At least this way I know what the movie is about.

Since Stieg Larsson passed away a few years a go and did not continue the series another author, David Lagercrantz has secured the rights to continue the series and has written ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" which was released this past September.  I look forward to reading this book and hopefully there will be a 4th movie using the same characters that appeared in the three Swedish movies.",1450051200,2,1290,4.368200836820083

4258519,5,B00440FO6M,"Excellent Series. I've seen the Trilogy and they were great, but seeing this extended set is awesome. I tried to like the 2011 movie with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, but having seen the originals before, I just couldn't THE Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. I give this a five star rating. .
I only wish I could understand the original language. I've watched it with subtitles and also the ""english dubbed"" version. Thankfully this Blu-ray has the option of dub over in the english language. It doesn't take away much of the story. Just a tad, that's all. For instance all the on-screen documents, or ""carvings"" are in Swedish so you don't know what they say. Like I said, It only takes a little away being dubbed in English.
The other ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", although it was pretty much exactly the same movie, I can only give it 2.5 stars. Rooney Mara was NOT Lisbeth Salander. Still, Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger was the right choice. Christopher Plummer is awesome anyway.",1448064000,2,1002,4.731428571428571

This was DEFINATELY money well spent! There hasn't been anything like this & this good in a long time!

My problem is while watching the version dubbed in English, often when they show something to read they'll show it translated with English sub titles. Sometimes the last sub just stays on the screen. It'll stay there till the next time the subs pop up. Sometimes up to 45 minutes.
I just figured out towards the end of the 1st movie to hit the rewind for about 3 seconds to clear it. Has anyone else had this problem or did I get a bad set of disks?

4258538,3,B00440FO6M,"It is fun to see all my GWDT fantasy characters come to life in this portrayal, but the excitement is taken down a notch or two by the restrained plotlines of the screenplay and direction. 3 stars tops.  Plus, the 5 interruptions (intermissions?) and previously viewed replays, with 6 credit rolls makes the 9 hrs of viewing borders on marathon viewing insensity.  This story really needs a Tony Mendez/Ridley Scott style direction and editing to match the fast paced storyline.  This screenplay has a lot of faults with lack of tension at the very top. I must also mention that I watched the dubbed version with English subtitles.  Very distracting.  The production may be better without the uninspiring dubbing and conflicting dialogue subtitles, but that is the least of the disappointments I had with the DVD viewing. As a disclaimer, I am into the books and I love me some intense Lisbeth Salander and her truth to power crusader sidekick, Mikael Blomkvist. But, the performances of this screenplay leave plenty to be desired.  Noomi Rapace makes a journeyman attempt at a role that is a little beyond her abilities.  She's great looking in costumes and makeup, but defers to those props too often to do the acting.  In the written trilogy, powerful women characters abound and none can resist seduction, including our heroine, by Blomkvist's charms. That lady killer part was recast and written out almost completely in the screenplay.  Fine, but why would Lisbeth fall for such a lost puppy as portrayed by a pox scared Michael Nyqvist looking for someone, anyone, to take him home for a warm bowl of milk. Salander stopped being a victim at 12 years old and takes control of her life in all aspects, save congeniality, to become a complete, if emotionally lacking, avenger of any who break her moral code.  But, the Swedish 6 part series' screenplay makes you wonder if she could even survive a week without the help of a posse of loving benefactors.  The screenplay shows love and loyalty to the novels with the omission of only a few characters and many of Kalle Blomkvist's carnal adventures, save for some torrid scenes with a horny Lisbeth and one with the needy business partner, Erika Berger, acted with some reserve by Lena Endre.  The best casting, I think, is the plainclothes Stockholm police detectives and DA: Jan Bublanski, Sonja Modig, Hans Faste and Richard Ekstrm played by Johan Kyln,Tanja Lorentzon, Magnus Krepper and Niklas Hjulstrm, respectively.  If you have the time and like a good sophisticated thriller, this is good small screen entertainment.  Not great.",1444694400,,2591,4.926436781609195

Yes, these movies are brilliant.  In Swedish.  I do not speak Swedish, but the dibbed versions, which a friend and I watched together, are not the same.  Perhaps the American actors who dubbed the original movies, did not want to come back and dub all of the material that was shown in ""Millenium.""

4258598,5,B00440FO6M,"Can't add much to the other reviews. Have read all three novels, seen the three Swedish movies and the Daniel Craig not-so-great version.

The novels and original Swedish versions are rivetting. Noomi Rapace is simply a force of nature. Almost impossible to believe the girl in this series is the same incredibly beautiful woman who has been in several so-so movies made since then (Prometheus, The Drop, Dead Man Down, etc.).

Should mention, the Hollywood adaption with Daniel Craig, although watchable, is nowhere near the Swedish original in intensity. In the Hollywood version, Daniel Craig was the big star, while the real heart of the story should have been the girl. Probably will take a pass on the second & third installments w/Daniel Craig and just rewatch the Swedish version again on Netflix.",1432598400,,805,5.045112781954887

N Rapace is superb in all 3 in her difficult role. One interesting aspect of this set is the ability to have them play in English.

4258645,5,B00440FO6M,Second only to the LOTR trilogy. Brilliant film!,1424908800,,48,5.125
4258646,5,B00440FO6M,"For a long time, I owned the first movie (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) and it is one of my favorites Swedish movies and it works quite well as a mystery, the setting, the characters, and the overall atmosphere of the movie is very well-done. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Lisbeth Salander) is a unique female character in the history of cinema, she is like a female hero with intelligence and a dark side. I would give the first movie 5 star.

I would also give the second movie (The Girl Who Played With Fire) 5 star although it is probably not as strong as the first movie. In the second movie, the story is about two journalists investigating a crime ring involved with trafficking females. The journalists naturally cross path with Mikael Blomkvist who is also a journalist and main character from the first movie. As the investigation gets hairy, the movie starts to reveal facts about Lisbeth Salander's past and and the connection between seemingly unrelated events start to build up. Although this second movie doesn't have as much suspense as the first one, it is still a pretty good film.

The third film (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) unfortunately is the weakest in the franchise. It seems to serve as a second part to The Girl Who Played With Fire but it is mostly driven by dialogues between characters that don't seem to progress the story forward. They keep talking about a secret network within Swedish government however the connection of this network to events in The Girl Who Played With Fire is too vague. I felt that the some of the things mentioned in The Girl Who Played With Fire didn't get proper closure, and this movie became a story about something else. This movie is the most personal one in the franchise about Lisbeth Salander's character. I also thought the court drama at the end didn't work well. Accusations against Lisbeth Salander's character went on for too long while all that time Lisbeth and her lawyer had clear evidence to refute all the accusations easily. Other than these flaws, it wrapped up the trilogy nicely.

There is a fourth disc in the box set which is more like a documentary about the trilogy. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, when I do, I will update this review",1424908800,,2244,4.619047619047619
4258647,5,B00440FO6M,One of the best movie trilogies ever. Each movie can stand alone and is excellent in its own right. Happy to have these in my collection.,1424649600,,137,4.3076923076923075
4258648,5,B00440FO6M,This Swedish version followed the book to the letter. The character of Lisbeth is more developed in this version than in the American release but it is also a little more graphic. I watched the dubbed English version and the only problem was that all the signs and the info on the computer screens was in Swedish.,1424563200,,313,4.508771929824562

4258659,5,B00440FO6M,Reallly enjoyed reading this.  It was a thriller and liked the Swedish version of the movie.

4258678,5,B00440FO6M,"The Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, Extended Version is offered in several different language choices.  What is less apparent is that the three movies have been cut in numerous ways as well.  I purchased the Swedish version with English dubbing and found it to be quite a bit shorter than a version I'd previously viewed that was in the original Swedish with both English and French dubbing, as well as English and French subtitles.  I returned the version with English dubbing only and repurchased the version with English and French dubbing.  The latter version (English and French dubbing) has several segments that I found missing from the former (English only dubbed) version which adds significantly to plot development and overall enjoyment of the viewing experience.  Another benefit is that the English/French dubbed version is missing all the trailers advertising soon-to-be-released (now released) movies, which may explain the motivation for some of the movie ending up on the cutting room floor.  This series was so popular that it was released with dubbing in several languages.  I'm aware of another dubbed in Italian as well, though I'm not aware of how complete it may be or if some of it was cut from the original.  In any case, this is an excellent trilogy and, with the above considerations addressed, I'm very happy with my purchase.  It's not so often that movies of this quality end up on the screen.  The Swedes seem to know something about telling a yarn on film.  In my opinion, this is a much better option than the comparable U.S. version starring Daniel Craig, which is only the very first of the three Steig Larsson books, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so it's missing The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

4258710,5,B00440FO6M,"nicely packaged set, phenomenal movies, great price.

I have the books but hadn't read them (I always have to watch the films first) and when I saw that Netflix had these movies available to stream, I was thrilled.  They had the ""right"" edition, too, the extended editions which means each of the movies in the trilogy is in two parts, as it was originally made to be a Swedish miniseries.  The fact that I watched ALL of them for free and THEN bought them speaks volumes.

I haven't seen the English version, so cannot compare them.  I can tell you that if you watch enough Swedish, after a while you barely need the subtitles.  I feel like I could go there and learn the language easily.

The movies themselves are COMPELLING.  Each one within the trilogy is different; in this respect I think Larssen was a genius.  The first movie is a murder mystery, the second is more of a thriller, and the third movie is a courtroom drama.  In this respect, the whole of the movie project stays fresh from beginning to end, because it's none of it redundant, all of it relevant and the actors are FANTASTIC.

I can't wait to watch them again now that I know how it ends, so I can see the things I ""missed"" the first time around.... and I'm so sorry the writer passed away, I'd have love to have had more work by him.

Bottom line is, you won't regret it!",1414281600,,1346,4.34

There are two versions of this trilogy. One is in its original language with English subtitles. The other is dubbed English without English subtitles.

Having read the books and seen the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and being disappointed in how badly it was edited and how much of the book was left out, I took a chance and bought the Swedish trilogy where all 3 books had already been made into movies. Read the description carefully and make sure you get the version that is dubbed in English so you don't have to sit there and read subtitles. Even this set does omit some action and details found in the books, but it is remarkably accurate and true to the books. This is one of those rare times that if you have read and enjoyed the books, you will also enjoy watching these 3 DVDs. This set is well worth the price!!",1401062400,3,834,4.284810126582278

I enjoyed both versions, amazed how similar they both were in regard to story line and plot.  I just finished watching the second Swedish version, and as soon as I finish the 3rd book of the series I will watch the 3rd Swedish production.

Don't get me wrong, Daniel Craig is great, but I just can't take anyone named Rooney seriously, at least not when it's their first name.  Aside from totally over playing the part, she just can't hold a candle to Noomi Rapace, especially if you see her in the original film first.

Of course, if you're one of those people who are mentally taxed by movies like ""Transformers"", you might not enjoy it.  Also there is a rather graphic and disturbing scene, not for the weak of mind or heart, but there is enough forewarning that you can look away if you're not up to it.

All this time wasting really takes you right out of the movie, and almost ruins the enjoyment of them. If they wanted to split the movies into two parts for the sake of not requiring people to sit through a 3-hour movie, then they should have started ""part 2"" right away, instead of doing a recap and credits. If you want ""part 1"" and ""Part 2"" back-to-back, as I'm sure most will, then the recap and opening credits will really take you out of the movie. that's why I'm only rating this three stars.

So many things glossed over or left out entirely...it's bizarre and makes for an uneven and unhappy viewing experience. The only part of any of this I liked was Noomi Rapace.

Since the American film industry is only interested in making money and did such a horrible job with the first story line, again this is my own personal opinion, we (actually me and my other hence the 'we')thought to purchase this Extended Swedish edition to see a better following of the story line. Wrong answer!!! The Swedish story writers did a worse job on the first book (have not wanted to even load the next Blu-ray disc for books two and three) than their American counter-parts which I (we) found to be incredibly . . . . there are no appropriate adjectives to describe how horrible their interpretation was that we would want to print here.

Unlike some other reviewers, I like the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo better because Rooney Mara acted well in it. She is more convincing as a troubled young woman with an attitude than Noomi Rapace. The settings in the American version is also better, e.g. the estate where the Vanger family lives seems to be more appropriate as they are supposed to be a rich family. Also, in the Swedish movie, Blomvist was once babysat by Harriet Vanger, which makes it less credible, considering that both characters were at the same age. Of course, the American version has the benefits of being a major movie with better budget than the Swedish version, which is more like a TV series. With that said, this trilogy provides good entertainment values and contains solid acting. My recommendation: Buy both the Trilogy and the American version of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

I wish they had been able to include more, but time constraints can be a bugger. They pretty much followed the book except when a little reweaving was necessary due to scene cuts. The spirit of the books was faithfully stuck to. A great way to spend 9 hours!",1387756800,,422,4.565789473684211

I read the book before seeing the Swedish edited shortened movie.  Noomi Rapace is the perfect cast for Lisbeth Salander, much much better than Rooney Mara's wooden version.  I'd rate Daniel Craig and Michael Nyqvist as equals in portraying Mikael Blomkvist.  The shorter Swedish edit or US version just don't do credit to the Stieg Larsson's story.",1387756800,,510,4.883720930232558

If you're a purist (and I tend to be) you may like reading these books and watching the Swedish version rather than the Americanized version produced later on.  Also, as much as I like Daniel Craig, Michael Nyqvist was better in the role.  These films led my partner and I into researching and watching Nyqvist's other films.  He's a very good actor.",1386374400,,396,4.695652173913044
4258872,5,B00440FO6M,"This is the definitive movie from the Stieg Larsson books and the American movie version of the first book, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is second even tho they cast it with Movie Stars of real ability. Noomi Repace is, for me, Lisabeth: even as Rooney Mara was really good.

If you loved the books like I did you will appreciate that they really endeavored to stay closer to the text. They did pare away some interesting subplots and consolidate and shift some incident timing. That this has six 90 minute segments for a miniseries on TV gives a real advantage to tell the story of Solander, Blomkvist, the Vanger family, Berger, Neidermann and Zalachenko and include Inspector Bubble and Figuerola and Linder and Armansky and Teleborian with some character development. TV offers this advantage over the feature films--telling the story at a leisurely pace, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters with less stereotyping

When you buy this set you may go back to it enough to get past the fact that you miss some visuals because you have to read the subtitles.

You will also get some insight on Swedish language, its share of english roots and how they borrow from English and American pop culture.",1386028800,,1216,4.753554502369668

This is loong and gross but not rich.  The endings of each of the three feel kind of canned,

The best part is the abusive social worker in charge of the lead character's case.  Like the Pusher films. this trilogy makes the Viking countries look incredibly ominous and ... PAGAN.  There's something raw and kind of different of their nudity that doesn't really jibe with Carl Larssen paintings.  It kind of reminds me of the gross looking kisses in Fanny and Alexander which totally threw me off the lace and doodads in the mise en scene.  Despite their reputation for liberal behavior, French films never have gross kissing scenes but I think the tide has turned for American and perhaps even earlier for Scandinavian films - what's going on?",1383955200,,1015,4.605555555555555

Filmed in Sweden with Swedish actors, it faithfully presents the novels in a complete and understandable way which is saying a lot as the books are quite complex and involved.  Frankly I found it much superior to the Dragon movie starring Daniel Craig, even though he's one of my favorite actors.  The three stories are presented in Swedish with English subtitles or with the original films dubbed in English.  I preferred the subtitled version as it made it more true to the author's vision for the novels.  There are many accomplished actors in this Trilogy and the lead actors were outstanding.  I highly recommend this presentation of Steiger Larson's Trilogy .",1383868800,3,777,4.984496124031008

Some scenes extremely painful to watch, but necessary to the story.  I recommend that parents watch it with their teens, especially daughters (no younger than 13).

There are some very explicit sexual scenes which I could have lived without, but it's easy to fast forward if one is embarrassed or made uneasy.  Otherwise I loved it for all the best reasons, the good guys won, and the bad ones got what they deserved. Another good alternative with this series, you can watch it dubbed in English, for those who have trouble reading the captioning, or in Swedish with English subtitles, which is how I liked it, because I love hearing different languages.",1383696000,,589,4.6

While the version I watched  before seemed to be complete, the extended version adds so much more to the trilogy.  Watching this seems to make the scenes so much more complete and better explains the relationships between the characters.  It also explains, more fully,  how the Millennium comes to remain financially sound.

I RARELY watch the extras for movies or I may just skim through  them.  I watched the entire fourth disc - loving every second of it.  Everyone attached to these movies should be very proud of their work.  At this point in time I read that the second film is still being planned by U.S. to be made.

THIS is the ultimate for any lover of the books (and there are plenty of people who love this series of books) and if you are one of them.... be sure to by this. It rocks. It has decent special features too, which some films really do not. I highly recommend this version to anyone who likes a good mystery and the two car chases were realistic (not many American car chases are what I would call :realistic) and I found the adaptation of these books very well done....much better than in the American film. Don't be afraid of reading subtitles... it's good for you. And what bugged me about the American version was that yes, it was in English, but they had such heavy accents that one needs subtitles too.

My husband did not read the books and he loved watching these films with me. I'm so sad we won't be getting any more of Lisbeth's adventures. She is one of the best characters ever created.",1377648000,,1104,4.380487804878049
4258918,5,B00440FO6M,Absolutely excellent movies.  The Swedish version is much more intelligent than the American.  The lead actors are awesome. Highly recommend watching these movies.,1377475200,,163,6.043478260869565

4258921,5,B00440FO6M,"I don't own any of the DVD/Blu-ray sets yet. However, I have been able to see the extended edition of all three movies. One thing that was a bit difficult was the fact that it was hard to keep up with who was who. But, the technical aspects of the story more than made up for that. I haven't seen the shorter version of the story. But, I found this extended edition to be thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. I particularly identified with the Lisbeth character. Although, not too much due to the overtly Gothic aspect of her character. But, I wouldn't change it.

I've heard that the theatrical release was a different aspect ratio to the TV airing. So, I decided to take a more technical comparison of the two versions. First of all, the first one was shot on Super 35. The other two on Super 16. So, no matter how it gets cropped, the quality of the transfer is going to be the same. (Terminator fans know that T2 will never look any better than the Blu-ray release.) The theatrical release was 2.35:1. The extended edition is 1.78:1 (I read one source that also had 1.85:1, but this is marginal). I have taken sample snapshots of both editions and, while the frame is shrunken in on the sides, it has been extended top to bottom. I don't know what the consistency is of where the framing takes place from scene to scene throughout all three movies. But, considering the fact that 1.78:1 is ample room to contain a large part of the picture (especially in comparison to pan-n-scan home video releases of the 80s and 90s), I don't think we have to worry about missing much in this release.",1377043200,,1597,4.450511945392491
4258922,5,B00440FO6M,"Box is pretty, disks look great. This trilogy is worth watching, it spins off a bit from the american version of the Dragon Tatto but actors are still great and you get to see more cases worked by this duo",1377043200,,205,4.15
4258923,5,B00440FO6M,"You can't find a better foreign film very gritty and graphic. I fell in love with Lisbeth right off.  The foreign version is the only one for me.  I love Noomi Rapace and she plays Lisbeth to a tee.  I love every part and she has found a place in my heart and can not be replaced by other versions.  Also this is a must see in its own language.  I watch in subtitles, something is missing if you watch in English, I think the tone of the movie changes when in English.

Lisbeth has overcome some terrible events and come out as well adjusted as any of us.  She can cope in the world, just leave her alone and play fair.  Be careful, do not get on her bad side cause she can take care of herself.  She has some formidable friends too that do help her. Sometimes you just gotta take the help!

Rent it, buy it, either way watch it!!

4258925,5,B00440FO6M,"I am becoming more of a fan of Swedish filmmaking and I think the three films are a pretty faithful rendition of the books and the acting and direction are consistently excellent.  It's nice that you can watch them either with subtitles or dubbed into English.  I prefer the subtitles and haven't watched the dubbed versions yet - perhaps someone else can respond to the dubbed version.  Not to knock the Daniel Craig version but that one had to shorten everything to the highpoints of the stories. It makes me wonder why American films seem to be relying more and more on visual storytelling than on trusting audiences to follow a story with well-written screenplays and fraught silences. This version has plenty of adrenaline-producing moments and surprising twists, but also is full of the murky darkness which produces so much suspense and doesn't provide easy answers.",1376784000,,873,4.965753424657534

This is one of my all time favorite movies, one cannot but feel for the caustic, anti-social, and horribly abused, heroine!  I; have too watch this movie over and over, people say, that the new version with Danial Craig is better, No, not really, this version, done in Swedish, is from my opinion much truer, The scenes will make one squirm, with tension,  Noomi Repace, is an awesome actress.  I am struck, with her manipulation of the material.  You will probably not see the subtleness of her acting,  but she is one of new favorite actresses.

The producers did have to pick and choose some story threads to eliminate which disappointed me but all three films did hold very true to the books and in the first film did a much better job staying to the story line than the Craig version. The casting was terrific, the editing was just as good, and the directing was truly outstanding. I have mentioned to my wife that she has to watch it very carefully because of various nuances incorporated in the characters. Lastly I want to comment on the art in the background of each film while the actors names are being presented. As I am not a film-maker I do not have the correct name for this part of the offering, but I do want to say the artwork was the best I have ever seen in a film, and in some ways reminded me of a lost art genre in the US which was called WPA art created in the great depression.

Noomi Rapace was well cast as the Lady with the Dragon Tattoo  A disgraced investigative reporter hired to find a dead woman's killer hires a young female hacker to help him and they uncover a string of murders going back several years,  Murders that could not have been committed by the same man.  The answer is surprising.  This begins the trilogy of the girl with the dragon tattoo.. The thing to remember is that the stories are not about all the murders and additional plots, they are about the girl with the dragon tattoo and what she does and who she is.  From her childhood she has come to hate those who exploit or who take advantage of weaker victims.  She is well equipped to defend them as long as she can keep herself safe

4259010,3,B00440FO6M,"I don't understand the hoopla about this Trilogy. The
""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is not what the first episode is called in Sweden where it is known as ""Men Who Hate Women,"" which sort of gives it away. But at least the first episode has an interesting puzzle - what happened to Harriet Vanger? The following two episodes are where the heavy-handed feminism rears its head; no puzzle to work out so it no longer is a detective story but rather some sort of attempted thriller where everyone knows how it will work out coupled with the ""Perils of Pauline"" - will Elizabeth Salander be unjustly convicted? But no where does the viewer get to ask why Elizabeth had the right to set her father on fire because he abused her mother, in the first place? OK I've had my say; you pays your money - you takes your choice. (Please don't jump all over me because I may or may not have taken Elizabet's age in consideration when she torched her father; that  brutal act is clearly psychopathic and is not compensated by her father's abuse of her mother in my opinion.)",1369267200,,1059,4.458762886597938

Once again as everyone always agrees not quite as good as the books but that is because you can get more in depth in the books than you can in a movie of course. But still a truly Amazing movie adaptation of the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy. I have seen the U.S. version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and it was alright just not long enough to satisfy like the books and even these movies which run about 3 hours each could still be longer. But I don't think you could still get as in depth as the books do even if each movie run for 6 hours.

But this set sure gives you a great taste of the books and was done quite well the actors fit the parts perfect and the story follows quite close to the story in the books with only a few minor changes and different interritaions to make them fit in a 9 hour movie set. Like the books you don't want them to end watching them all back top back to back is almost a must. All in all a pretty darn good adaption from the writen word.

Shows some pretty graphic scenes and some intense action and excitement. A true AAA+++ Movie Set.!!! and a Great accompany to the Trilogy Book Set too. Once again AAA+++",1369180800,2,1160,4.083333333333333

It was a little difficult for me to follow at first because of the language and subtiltles etc. However it was a gacinating story of the constant battle of good against evil. It does have a fairytale ending that unfortunately doesn't often happen in real life, but is still comforting to a simpleton like me.

the extended version is 111 minutes longer.
9 hours might sound like a LONG time, but there is a ton of story being told.
it's never boring for a second and the 9 hours are broken into 6 episodes of 90 minutes each.

with the extended version, you can choose subtitles or the English dub track.",1367366400,,563,6.394736842105263

what in the world was i waiting for?
the whole thing is awesome from beginning to end.

i'm really pretty shocked that i wasn't bored one time in 9 hours.  not for one second.
the lady with the dragon tattoo is a major badass!
and trouble seems to find her wherever she goes.
the whole story is captivating.

the subtitles being at the top in the beginning alarmed me a little.
but they moved down to the bottom after the opening credits were finished.
folks that don't care for subtitles can select the English-dubbed track instead.

love that it's divided into 6 episodes with brief recaps of the previous episode at the beginning of 2 thru 6.
i watched it over a couple of days and the recaps got me pumped as the episodes were starting.

never read the books but found this to be an outstanding story.
this extended version is the only version i have seen.

You prob know the storyline - so I won't go into that. However, if you've not seen the movies yet - buy them all together like this because once you finish one, you'll want to see the other ones. If you have seen them and want great quality - this is the set. The extra scenes that they put back in help the story lines a little but not much.

I only wish they had sent out the extended versions. I watched these on netflix, its a mini-series type w/ 6- almost 2 hour parts. Had a lot of good fill, and helped to follow the book more.

If you have yet to experience these movies or know them already and would like to add this set to your collection, you will do well with this purchase.

Sadly, the Daniel Craig/David Fincher English version is a two star version of this story. After seeing both, this Neil's Oplev version is totally mesmerizing and I don't normally relish reading subtitles. This movie disturbingly is a no holds barred portrayal of a psychopath and rape, so be prepared. I have to give the trilogy five stars without hesitation.",1359590400,,461,4.987012987012987

I have read all three books recently and I found the Millennium Trilogy followed the books closely and was immensely entertaining.

4259117,5,B00440FO6M,"This is basically an extended version of the original foreign film trilogy. The additional material is true to the novels and makes the story line much more clear for those who have not read the books. The comic-like opening sequences for each episode seem a bit odd at first, but they too contain important story elements that help bring clarity to the plot line. Casting is great. There are a few more graphic scenes that make this even more inappropriate for children than it was to begin with.",1357776000,,497,4.659090909090909

The dubbing almost matched what each character was saying to the point that I forgot I was listening and watching a movie in Swedish with English dubbing. I can't follow a movie with subtitles as I can not read that fast and soon lose interest in the movie.
The story line and acting were great.
I really enjoyed the bonus dvd about the books and the movies. Sorry to learn of the author's death and that this is the end of his work.
I shared the dvds with my neighbor and she loved them too.

The next two, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" continue the drama, intrigue and pathos.  The Swedish-language track with subtitles, I think, adds to the authenticity of the film.  After watching all three, I was left craving for a fourth.

I think there is less emphasis in the Swedish version on the violence and of course, it follows through on the complete story, which makes it more satisfying.  I enjoyed seeing actors who look more like everyday human beings, not pretty faces and bodies.  The English version takes one to the edge with the violence and menace but really, I couldn't say either was better than the other, just different.",1355097600,,548,4.797872340425532

The first volume, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"",  is at once a great mystery story and an introduction to a fascinating character of modern fiction.  The follow up in the next two books , expanding on who the ""Girl"" is, and on all who know her and become her loyal friends, puts this trilogy in a towering category.

4259154,5,B00440FO6M,"At 3 hours apiece, it would be easy to think that this collection was filled with unnecessary scenes which only served to slow the pace.  NOT SO!  The extra footage helps greatly in the development of the characters and their relationships.  The secondary actors become more than just walk-in roles and create a richer tapestry when you take all 3 films as a whole.  For those who find 9 hours to be too daunting, the series is broken into 6 easily digest able parts.  I can't speak for the quality of the dubbing (I much prefer watching foreign movies in their native language with subtitles). The extra disc provides an interesting documentary on the author and the tumultuous legacy his untimely death left behind.  For those who've only seen the American version, you owe yourself to see this grittier, more accurate version.",1354233600,,829,4.802816901408451

It says ""Part 1/Part2"" on each disc, but each movie has its own disc and will prompt you to choose to play the next part halfway through each. I was hoping for deleted scenes but don't have any (they're included in the movie, but some original scenes are completely missing and replaced).

I felt that the first film was better the American version.  I loved the next two and I wanted more.  I watch all of the special features.

My best friend and I are still speaking in a made up ""Swedish"" language as we play that we are in the lives of these characters.  It is acted so well.  You will love this even if you have not read the books.  Keep it in Swedish so that you can get the nuances of the language.",1352678400,2,582,4.125

I also took the option of listening to this in Swedish with subtitles, simply to hear the real voices of the actors--which was a treat.  The nuance was definitely better in the Swedish version voices, but still, the dubbed edition was fine.

The characters came to life and this version seems grittier and somehow more true to life, no real beauties or hunks, few toned in the gym bodies with lots of plastic surgery for perfect noses or boobs, or overly whitened teeth.  It's a small thing, but it added greatly to the story, looking at people that seemed sliced from your own neighborhood or city, instead of Hollywood ""stars.""

I loved having all 3 books in these 3 movies as well. It's a gritty story and may not be for everyone, a glimpse into another world and culture that I enjoyed.",1350604800,4,865,4.597402597402597

4259171,5,B00440FO6M,"Enough has been said about the movies, comparing the Swedish and US versions.  Now that we've seen both, we have no favorite.  Each is exceptional in their own way.  I'll comment on the subtitles, dubbing, and the video transfer.

Subtitles: I always watch foreign movies first in their original language and read the English subtitles.  I get a better feel for the actor's portrayal of the role by doing so, hearing their own voice.  In some films the subtitles disappear so quickly you don't have the chance to finish reading the text, and I'm a fast reader.  The subtitles in the Trilogy, Extended Edition are easy to read and nicely timed.

Dubbing: I'll always watch the movie again in the dubbed version.  In some foreign films the dubbing is so distracting I can't finish the movie.  Memories of ""What's Up, Tiger Lily"" flash through my mind (Woody Allen's comedy dialogue dubbed over a B-grad Japanese crime movie).  In the Trilogy though, the dubbing is actually pretty good and the translations more complete.  Here is one brief example.  In the subtitled version Lisbeth is told her ""guardian"" has had a stroke.  When she sees him in the hospital the subtitle says ""You idiot.""  In the dubbed version she is told her ""parole officer"" has had a stroke.  When she see him in the hospital she says ""Go ahead and die you idiot.""  Watching the movie the second time in the dubbed version was almost like watching another movie entirely.

Video Transfer:  I have not seen the Blu-ray version, but the DVD transfer is exceptional.  The DVD transfer is as close to Blu-ray perfect as I've seen in any movie.  Because the transfer is in a 1.85:1 widescreen format (non-letterbox), it fills an HDTV screen.  I cannot imagine that the Blu-ray is enough of an improvement to justify the more than double price difference for the Trilogy.  Hey, if money is no concern, get the Blu-ray.  If you want to save a few bucks and still get a great movie transfer though, the DVD will definitely satisfy you.",1348099200,9,1998,4.708092485549133
4259172,4,B00440FO6M,"I enjoyed the movie.  I thought the Lisbeth character not as good as in the Daniel Craig version, and the Mikael Blomquist character not nearly as good looking.  But I enjoyed this version, and really wanted to see the additional books.  I watched in the English version and was surprised to find I was not bothered at all by the words spoken not matching the lips of the actors.",1347840000,,379,4.463768115942029

4259175,3,B00440FO6M,"First of all, the 1st disc arrived damaged and I've returned the whole package, but did watch what wasn't damaged.

The guy who played Blomqvist was not good, not well cast at all.  Everyone else was pretty spot on.  The picture quality in some sections was sketchy and (for me) the whole thing had the look and feel of a made for TV special.

I watched in Swedish with English subtitles because I liked it better that way, the English 'dubbed' sountrack was passable, but not great.

For all the stuff about Erica they included, they never really payed off her character in the end, kinda puzzling.",1347235200,,599,4.5607476635514015

I totally enjoyed the Swedish version with Noomi and frankly couldn't stop watching it until I had seen all nine hours two times.

4259178,4,B00440FO6M,"Whilst I found the books long winded and difficult to retain interest due to their overly political nature and long winded descriptions, the television miniseries was reasonably well paced and more intrigueing. As the story lines stayed close to the book, the variances helped to create a more engaging story. The temptation to follow the American philosophy of romantic endings was, thankfully, not indulged and the thoughtfulness of the Wallander series (Swedish version) was evident. Although I would recommend to see Wallander, this is also an excellent story.",1346112000,,564,5.420454545454546

4259181,5,B00440FO6M,"If you are a Millennium Trilogy fan, this is a must-have.

I have read all 3 books and first saw this when it came in the original theatrical Swedish version.

The film makers started off with an objective to make this as true to the book as they could. This extended edition with the additional footage and run time is a pure joy to watch.

The only amusing thing to watch out for is that if you play this in the English language version and turn on the English subtitles (I do this as some movies' dialogue can be rather muffled), you will find that the spoken and written text will be somewhat different - but the meaning is more or less the same. Having said this, the English translation is clear and very well done.

Excellent!",1345334400,,733,4.328467153284672
4259182,5,B00440FO6M,"The Trilogy is well done and follows the plots of all three books very closely leaving out little if anything! I was very satisfied as to the authenticity of the background and the characters, who fit the book very well. Dubbing is extremely well done and follows smoothly... The only drawback was the letters and papers, books and such were all shown in Swedish but most had English subtitles shown however briefly.

Overall a very true screen representation of the three books ... well worth the prce and the time to watch them! Extremely pleased here!",1345248000,,554,4.770833333333333
4259183,5,B00440FO6M,"Although I ordered both the third book and the Millenium Trilogy DVDs via Amazon, the DVD arrived from a different location (which Amazon had referred me to when the screen said Amazon was temporarily out of stock) and when I opened it there was some slight damage to the case where it had been bent and the plastic containing two of the DVDs broken on the edge, so instead of waiting I watched through all discs in case I had to write to get a replacement.  I'm happy to report the DVD discs made it through unscathed.  I taped the plastic otherwise so I can still store the DVDs without any problem.  [The secondary retailer should have sent the movie inside a sturdy cardboard box, not an envelope with minimal bubble wrap.]

The Millenium Trilogy with Swedish subtitles is FANTASTIC, IMHO.  I had watched the shorter version on YouTube before it was pulled for copyright violation so I knew the acting was good, but the full-length version is SO much better because it includes the parts of the book that were not in the shorter version (but watching the shorter version is what prompted me to spend the money to buy the longer version and hope the missing parts were included; I was thrilled that the longer version is the more complete story as found in the book).  I have not tried to watch the English-dubbed version because I suspect it would detract from the Swedish language version.  I do understand some of the Swedish words and location names anyway (I do genealogy research so have had to learn a few words of Swedish).  Maybe later I'll watch the dubbed version, but not now.

I read the first book quite a while ago and am nearly done reading the second book.  I ordered and received the third book the same time as I ordered the DVD, and my original plan was to wait to watch the movies until after I'd completed the last two books, but the cracked packaging is the reason I decided I'd better find out if the DVDs needed replacing, so I watched all of them.

Stieg Larsson is a wonderful author who writes with considerable clarity and vivid descriptions, and the producers and director of the film version have done the books justice.

Both books and the movie trilogy are SO worth the money!  Anyone who loves a good mystery would probably like both the books and the movies, especially since the movies are faithful to the books.",1345248000,,2351,4.542654028436019

So we were excited to find out this year the trilogy was available. It comes in 4 DVDs but it is actually 6 average length movies on 3 of them with a bonus feature making up the 4th DVD. We chose to watch it with the English Dub language which is pretty close. The acting is really good and the characters are believable. We watched it over 3 nights and it was better than watching a mini-series. Our only disappointment was when it ended we had were left wanting to watch more. All of the movies seem to flow pretty good and the carry over to the next movie is exactly where it left off in the previous one. Not a whole lot of guessing or speculation as to what happened last. Even if you take more time between watching's, each movie starts out with a recap of the prior movie. We are now looking for other movies that are multiple movies that allow us to watch over a series of night. the quality and clarity of the movie ws also very good. Compared to other dubbed movies I have seen this is very good and keeps you engaged with the plot and characters. Note: This is so much better than the American version with Daniel Craig!!!(we snuck a peek but never finished watching). We will probably watch again when we have guest over.

Maybe just too controversial even for today's audience??

4259208,5,B00440FO6M,"The extended version is nothing short of fabulous. My wife and I were two of the millions who fell in love with the three individual movies from Sweden. We just finished watching the extended version trilogy, which added back in a lot of the scenes that didn't make the final cut of the films. We are people who often check out the special features of DVDs. A sometimes animated conversation goes back and forth between us as whether or not the deleted scenes would've improved the movies. There was no disagreement about the scenes that were added back in here. They improved the films by giving more background material. In the original releases there was some choppiness which was corrected in the extended version.

I checked some of the one star reviews on the original films. They were apparently written by idiots. The movie carried an appropriate rating. For someone to complain that the film was too graphic for them, as they were into family films, well . . . , sometimes words fail me. For those who bitched about the films not having as much information as the books, Wait, What! How do you expect a movie to convey as much information as a book? Do you want to see 6-8 hour movies like the Russians have? Or to put it on a simpler level, have you EVER seen a movie which conveyed all the information of the book it was based on?

Bought this, and over the course of a couple weeks I have watched all three movies first in English (dubbed) and then again in the original Swedish (with subtitles).  The subtitles certainly take some extra energy to follow, but it is a lot of fun.  Without going into detail, these movies have some areas where the story line differs from the books, but that is to be expected with every movie-based-on-a-book.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who has read and enjoyed the Millennium Trilogy from Stieg Larsson.",1338681600,,693,4.702479338842975

I planned to see the American version, and literally stumbled into the Netflix offering because of a blueray disc player connected to the internet. I watched the 'dragon tattoo'segment first, not knowing it was part 1 and 2 of 6 parts. I watched it on Netflix, which loaded quickly and played flawlessly. The only problem I notice is that the dark scenes are somewhat posterized, meaning I could see levels of dark colors. The story is a bit hard to follow, because of the subtitles and the Swedish names. Still, this is one of the most engrossing, disturbing, and eventually satisfying 9 hour stories I will ever experience. I am curious as to if the storyline caused any backlash in Sweden, because the story shows massive governmental and institutional corruption, low-level murders for hire, incompetent police work, etc. My only disbelief with the storyline as presented in the Swedish films is: Why are the 4 reporters-writer-journalists and their little office NEVER attacked or bombed by any of the bad guys??? Was this explained in any way in the books? or are we to just believe that journalists are just off-limits to even the totally corrupt?",1338076800,,1331,4.816593886462882

I liked the Swedish version much more. The actors are more like every-day people. The settings are pretty stark and straight-forward. Just like (HEY!) a Swedish movie.

The English dubbing is great.

The movies were made for Swedish TV, so they have breaks. It may just be my Blu-Ray player, but I recall moving between segments could be smoother.

There are some English subtitles to translate Swedish text on signs and whatnot. Some of these subtitles hang around for quite a while. Not a big deal on HD displays, but they ARE there.

Your blu ray will do the best with either and it will still come out well. The edited version did not leave out any graphic parts, however what it did leave out was characters and minor story lines. It gave you ah hah monments where you see why certain story lines played out they way they did. You get to see background information and you also see where the american version connects to the swedish version. I have been obsessed with this movie for weeks now, getting the extended version was a treat. I love movies like this especially foreign mini series. Sherlock Holmes on the BBC is a great example.

My approach was quite skeptical. Did a lot of research, checked some available video clips online that were very intriguing. The set has a very nice box. The overall quality of the picture is DVD at best, and is far from a real HD Blue Ray experience. I can imagine in good old Europe the movie was not shot in HD and it was not re-mastered to improve the quality. The movie is done fine, the acting is good. The stories in both versions are different, but they a both good. Comparing to the Hollywood version I must say that the European movie makers have a lot to learn from Hollywood.
However, considering the extremely interesting and intense story, the quality, even the acting doesn't really matter. It is a great movie experience! We have already seen it several times and I would definitely recommend it!

4259218,3,B00440FO6M,"Absolutely loved this film series in it's original non-extended release and was eager to see it in an uncut version. Not very happy with this particular DVD compilation. Each of the first 3 discs contains two parts, but there is no way to 'play all' in the bare-bones menu options, so the action is interrupted somewhat by having to select and setup twice for each disc. There is a lot of graininess and/or pixelation, much more akin to a streaming video than what one might expect in a physical disc. Also, the video on the third disc, containing parts 5 and 6, is choppy and the disc will not play *at all* in my laptop player. (Disc not recognized.) So much for portability. I had hoped to be able to watch this while on a long road trip (I won't be in the driver's seat). I do appreciate the use of subtitles rather than voice-over (never a fan of dubbing).

Overall, the quality of this set is very disappointing. Very poor, substandard transfer to DVD. Hope a better set of discs is released soon.

UPDATE 5.19.12:
Sent the set back for a replacement. Replacement set had same issues. Again, the third disc, Hornet's Nest, will not play in my laptop. However, I did manage to get it to play in a much older (at least 10 yr) stand-alone DVD player.

Just want to add that, while this particular set is below par in quality (despite its hefty price tag) the *content* of the extended series is great. This is a first-rate trio of thrillers. Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are amazing, with characters who are compellingly and convincingly fleshed out. Rapace's portrayal of the darkly brilliant, quirky, and bitterly disenfranchised Lisbeth Salander is breathtaking. Nyqvist plays perfect counterpoint as Mikael Blomqvist, the calm, dogged, community-minded activist-cum-sleuth. Together, they are explosive. The Millennium Trilogy, as conceptualized for the Swedish screen, is a long, wild, gasp of a ride, and a very satisfying cinematic experience. I have also seen the English version of Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, and Christopher Plummer. Unlike the original Swedish, the English version falls flat and fails to engage. The characters, unfortunately, get lost behind the actors, and their back stories - so seamlessly woven into the original - feel jumbled, rushed and incomplete in the Craig/Mara film. Not awful, by any means, but somehow generic by comparison. Nothing in the genre quite holds a candle to the Oplev/Alfredson rendition of the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy. Too bad I can only give this particular release of this 5-star series a 3-star rating.

For those who are hard-of-hearing like myself, using the subtitles is very helpful, but in this dubbed version the subtitles translate the original Swedish, which doesn't match the dubbing.

We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.

So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.

Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. And we are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.",1333152000,,2466,5.209068010075566
4259239,5,B00440FO6M,"I recently bought the Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara version, I found the story to be excellent and I did not want to wait for the other movies of this series; so I bought the swedish version.  The movies are broken into two parts per disk.  The fouth disc is extras which I found to be interseting, but I doubt they are for repeated viewings.  There are some differences between US and Swedish version, but I think they are minor after first viewing.  The dialogue has been dubbed if you choose the english version, but various bits of e-mails and other signage is in swedish, so get get used to it.",1332892800,,594,4.422018348623853
4259240,5,B00440FO6M,"First, the problem:  The 3rd DVD disc skipped/stalled/froze/jumped in several places, with each place malfunctioning maybe 20 to 50 times.  The DVD did not look damaged, so this is probably a manufacturer's defect.  I read the reviews beforehand, and I did not see this problem in any of the reviews I read.

This extended edition of the three movies on DVD was sold on Amazon by Marco Labs Inc., on March 14th, 2012.  Maybe they had a bad batch?  Maybe it was just this one set?  I returned it for a refund, but wished I could have gotten a replacement instead.  I will buy it again, and hope for a flawless set.

The good part:  Discs 1 and 2 played without error.  I loved these movies.  In this extended edition, the movies are split into six total parts, two parts on each of the 3 movie discs.  I did not view the 4th bonus DVD disc.

I have not seen the American movie.  I have not read the books.  I watched the foreign extended edition movies in just the English subtitles with the foreign voice track. My eye sight is not great, and I do not read very fast, but I had no problem reading the subtitles on a 60 inch screen, while I walked on my treadmill.  The movies made the time fly by, an hour at a time for about 9 hours total (540 minutes.)

I do not recommend this movie for children under the age of 18.  There is a lot of nudity, sex and violence that would make me uncomfortable if I was watching this movie with my teenage kids.  And I am very liberal about sex and violence in movies.",1332892800,3,1504,4.2105263157894735

Although the characters carry the difficult script perfectly through the three films we are treated to more and more elements of the mystery of Lisbeth Salander and The Section.

4259262,5,B00440FO6M,"I call this the perfect poor man's gift.  I have ""gifted"" this video three times to rousing reviews.  My wife and I first watched the trilogy ""On Demand"" cable TV because she, an avid mystery reader, had already devoured the Steg Larson Trilogy and insisted we watch the first installment.  At that time it was ""sub title"" only and I am not real big on that concept.  However, once started it really drew me into the story and I started asking my wife to offer running commentary due to having previously read the series.  After the first video we had to wait a period of time for the second book (each one a movie length adaptation). The wait was rewarded each time.  Amazon has made this video series a bargin that anyone can afford.  I paid as much or more for the three book series (hardback).  In my opinion, the Swedish movie was head and shoulders over the Americanized version to hit the theaters.  They say the other two movie versions of the books are in the can.  Why wait.  Buy the real deal now and do your own comparing when the Americanized versions hit the screen (if ever).

4259263,5,B00440FO6M,This is such an incredible story of a young woman working through a really crappy situation. Do yourself a favor and watch it in Swedish. Don't do the whole dubbed thing unless you absolutely can't stand it. I watch a lot of subtitled movies myself so it's not a biggie to me. The series just seems to get better and better with each movie. I will admit that there are some scenes in the first movie that will make you cringe a little but it really develops the characters and either makes you love or hate them. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/ thriller or just looking for a good movie to keep you on your toes!,1329696000,,640,4.254098360655738

What was so great about this movie, it kept you guessing through out its' entirety.  I thought I had parts of the story figuered out only to be wrong.  The acting was also great by all, not to mention the female lead.  I would highly recommend this to all who are looking for drama, action and suspense.  I saw all episodes in one day, and enjoyed every minute of it.  Can't wait to see it over and over again!!!",1329696000,,557,4.009090909090909
4259265,5,B00440FO6M,"I bought the Swedish version for two reasons:  It was available and, frankly, I believed they would do a better job with the books than Hollywood would do.
The films artfully follow the books, carefully leaving out some details (Erika's marriage) or only alluding to lesser story lines, (the Vanger involvement with Millenium after Harriet returns from Australia). Their omission does not hinder the progression of the story line and the story line remains true to Stieg Larsson's books. Other incidents are condensed (e.g., Mikael Blomkvist being shot at in the woods outside of Hedestad and Erika Berger being threatened in her own home) in comparison to the books, nevertheless the terror these incidents provoked is clearly communicated.
Aside from the superb script adaptation of the book, the casting was flawless.  Stieg Larsson's characters were no longer descriptions on a page or visions in my mind's eye, but alive, credible and visible in front of me.  Each actor epitomized his/her character and made him/her real, with real flaws and real gifts.
Because of the perfect marriage between the script and the casting/acting, these films are totally entrancing.  The six episode TV series format broke the story up into reasonable viewing time frames.
The only glitch I encountered was technical.  Subtitles for the Swedish only showed up on one episode.  They also showed up on one episode of the English dubbed version (go figure!).  I thought the English dubbing had a flatter overall tone to it than listening to Swedish intonation.

The Bottom Line Is: If you loved Stieg Larsson's book trilogy, you must get the Swedish production of The Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, Extended Version!",1329523200,2,1693,5.153284671532846

You can select either the (original) Swedish soundtrack or the English dubbed soundtrack. I don't have any knowledge of Swedish! The English dubbed soundtrack is done so masterfully that I usually forgot the actors were speaking Swedish ... until some piece of printed material was shown.
Each 'volume' of the trilogy is presented in two 90-minute (give or take a couple of minutes) segments. After watching the first segment of the first volume, I returned to the book and devoured the remaining part. Then watched the second segment. As many directors have said (about other movies), it is not practical for the screenplay to exactly follow the book; and this one doesn't either. However, if you have not read the book, then the movie makes a very captivating mystery! And, if you have read the book, then the fundamental story line is evident and chronologically correct; but presented differently.
Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth, as far as I'm concerned!
The sex-oriented scenes are not as explicit as the book describes; but I didn't want them to be!

Seeing the new American version of the film rekindled my interest in the story and prompted me to purchase the trilogy edition.  At first I was a bit worried that the dubbing would be what I call ""hokey,"" but let me tell you...it's fantastic.  Don't get me wrong...I enjoy subtitles when it comes to foreign films.  However, this time, I wanted to concentrate on the action and nuances first.  I will view all three movies again using the original soundtrack with subtitles.  If you are looking for top-notch entertainment in films, this dvd set is for you.  I highly recommend this set for those seeking a unique and unforgettable gift.

4259274,5,B00440FO6M,"I loved the theatrical versions of the Millenium trilogy but felt that something was definitely missing.  I knew that the trilogy was originally conceived for Swedish television as three 3-hour dramas, but I wasn't about to spend the money for a Swedish import without English subtitles! This American release of the complete Swedish trilogy rectifies that problems and adds the bonus of a superbly dubbed English language version that should please all but purists who insist on the subtitled original.

I generally prefer films in their original language, but suggest you give the English track a try. I found that if I watched the actor's eyes instead of their lips, I quickly forgot that the voices were dubbed. In fact, I've seen English language films where the lip syncronization was less perfect than in this set. Oddly enough, I became so accustomed to the English voices that I was a bit surprised to hear the stars' real voices speaking in Swedish in the bonus interviews.

As pointed out by another reviewer, there is a brief sequence of Miriam and Paolo escaping from the burning barn that was inexplicably left off of Disc Two, but that one flaw should not affect your overall pleasure in seeing this perfectly paced nine-hour marathon (broken into six approximately 90 minute segments).  My wife and I watched on three consecutive nights and were reluctant to go to sleep each night.

This complete set (especially when viewed in English) makes an American version seem all the more superfluous, but Rooney Mara's excellent performance as Lizbeth in the new version is every bit as remarkable as that of Noomi Rapace. Noomi is tougher and fiercer, but Rooney adds an appealing vulnerability to what is, essentially, a damaged child. I think there is room for both interpretations.

One thing is clear, though.  After watching this extended version, you will probably never want to watch the frustratingly edited theatrical versions again. It's that much better.",1328572800,7,1976,5.042944785276074

The original trilogy I purchased was inexpensive AND very well done.  Although it was English dubbed, they did an excellent job. The dragon tatoo movie (1 of 3 in the package), although somewhat different than the American movie version, is quite good and would have been even better had I not seen the American version at the theater.

Though an English-dubbed version is available, I recommend watching it in Swedish and enduring the subtitles.  The acting is great, the story gripping, and the production values high even though, as I understand, the second two films were essentially ""made for TV.""

The disc includes some ""extra"" features, including a decent, not exceptional, documentary on the life of the Millenium series author, Stieg Larsson.  It wasn't all that enlightening, but for those unfamiliar with his background, it makes for worthwhile viewing.  There were also interviews with the cast including Noomi Rapace.  Shot while she was getting made-up for a scene, the interview is actually quite interesting as Ms. Rapace talks about how she developed her performance.

4259298,4,B00440FO6M,"I read the Stieg Larsson Trilogy last year and loved the books. I enjoyed the movies just as much. I thought they did a great job following the books and keeping the stories real! Although dark, the story lines keep you hooked. I could definitely watch and enjoy these all over again!",1327276800,,284,4.480769230769231
4259299,5,B00440FO6M,"I saw the three Swedish movies when they were released in the theatres in 2010, and while I loved the first one (I had not read the book), I was less than pleased (or put more correctly: frustrated) with the second and third movies (by which time I had read the books), as there was simply way too much material cut out from the books, and without having read the book it would've been impossible to understand what was happening. Now, after much rumors and delays, finally come the ""extended"" versions of the three movies, plus a bonus DVD with extras (in totals 4 DVDs; 635 min).

I'm not going into any plot discussion or performance assessments of each of these movies, as others have done it already, so let me just comment on the new elements you'll find on here. As to the extended versions: TGWPWF benefitted by far the most, as an additional FIFTY minutes were added to the existing movie, and thanksfully so, as the original movie was truly given the ""short"" thrift and as a consequence pretty much made no sense. The other movies each got about an extra 30 minutes. It cannot be emphasized enough how the additional footage has made these movies so much better! Also done nicely is that each of the three movies is divided into two 90 min. segments. I watched the entire set of 6 segments over 6 consecutive evenings just recently, and I have to say I haven't watched anything better in the comfort of my house in a long time! (Please note that you have the option of watching this in their original Swedish version with subtitles, or in an English dubbed version. Why anyone would want to watch the dubbed version is beyond me.)

As to the bonus DVD: by far the best feature is the 45 min. documentary ""Millenium - The Story', which is really a look back on the life of author Stieg Larsson. We get a sense of the small town where he grew up near the Arctic Circle, far away from the hustle and bustle of Stockholm. Amazingly, Stieg's father (only 17 when Stieg was born) and younger brother are interviewed extensively. We also follow a group of tourists on the ""Millenium"" walking tour that is the rage these days in Stockholm. Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are interviewed, and I have to say Noomi looked shocking different (far more beautiful) than she did in the movies. Last but not least, we meet the editor of the publishing house who decided to publish this (and shows us the original manuscripts of the first 2 books to boot, telling us along the way that Larsson wrote and submitted indeed the first two volumes at the same time, just amazing!). Other features are not quite as interesting: there is another 15 min. so-so interview with Noomi Rapace, done ""on the fly"" while she is on the set of the third movie while getting make-up applied, as well another interview with Michael Nyqvist and some other cast members. The bonus DVD is rounded out with a collection of the various trailers and teasers that were shown in US theaters.

In all, what a fantastic movie package! I bought this basically as a Christmas present to myself, and then because of circumstances beyond my control didn't get a chance to see this until just now. One of the best movie box collections I have ever bought! Highly recommended.",1327276800,4,3236,4.566265060240964

4259301,4,B00440FO6M,"Movie review: The movie is cool. There are 3 main story with each split to 2 parts. Each part runs for around 90 minutes. In total the movie is actually like a mini series.

Bluray review: Part 1 and 2 (girl with dragon tattoo) video and audio quality is superb. Part 3 on the other hand, video is very grainy. In some scenes it is not so obvious but in most of them, it is. I am not sure whether they purposely did it in the name of some kind of ""art"". Not sure about the rest of the movies (part 4, 5 and 6) but since one of them is quite grainy, does it matter anymore how the rest looks like?

Nonetheless, I do not regret buying this. Totally worth it...unless part 4, 5 and 6 are worse and grainier than part 3.

Dear God, please send a miracle and make my Sony Bluray Player, Sony Amp and Sony Bravia filter out the grain and make it crisp clear. Amin.",1327276800,,859,4.011695906432749

There are no words to describe this Swedish mini-series. Why weren't these available to begin with!? Each film is divided into two parts on the three blu rays. I wouldn't want to try to watch this on DVD with the compressing of over three hours of material on one DVD (over nine hours for all three movies). Blu ray is made for these longer series. The video quality is amazing! Cannot get over the detail in the picture. Yeah, there is some grain. But this is evident in the film itself and the high resolution of blu ray format just brings it out. Glad they didn't try removing the grain, it adds to the atmosphere. And boy howdy, does this show have atmosphere! This is a four disc set (three for the series and one for special features) and the video is presented in a 1.78 format filling the 16:9 screen of your television. The audio is presented in Swedish 5.1 DTS-HD and the old Dolby Digital (from DVD years) for the English dubbed. Either one sounds really good and adds to the excitement in surround sound!
My only complaint is there should have been more special features. I know there were still scenes not added into this extended edition. They could have put more deleted scenes on each disc. Maybe a commentary of some sort from the stars or the director. This is one fascinating show, would like to know and see more...
Even if you have the older theatrical cuts, get this newer version. If you are a fan of the series do yourself the favor. It is a blast!!",1325030400,33,1642,4.422442244224422

Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace were well cast and very believable as Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Rapace's transformatin into Salander is amazing. I think it is best to have read the books before seeing the films in order to better follow the plot. I was disappointed that several major plot lines explored in the books were either altered or eliminated from the movies, but at the same time realized that the books are too far reaching to ever be done well in movie form. I have heard that the original TV series was closer to the books and I would also buy that if it ever became available in its entirety. I am also planning to see the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo next week to see how that stacks up. In summery: Worth watching if you have read the books.

It gave it more of the background what was happening around Lisbeth and Mikel(sorry about the spelling).  And the bonus disc with the documentary of the creation of the series was very interesting.

If you are a fan of this series pick this version up before seeing what the US version does to it.  I only hope they do the same justice to it that Sweden did.

Because of inclusions of new material, and yes, the removals of unnecessary scenes, it is much clearer and easier to understand the continuity of the narrative. The seven hour release had huge holes that were filled nicely. Lizbeth was torture raped by her new guardian, her mother was beaten by her sadistic father. But in the end she gets some very satisfying revenge on her new guardian, her father who shot her and even her half brother who buried her. Not to mention defending herself very handily against two motor cycle gang members hired to kill her. Plus sending the psychiatrist who mistreated her to prison. She saves Micke's life when he is tortured and nearly hung to death. Then she is shown walking with Holger Palmgren, her former guardian, the only person in her world she completely trusts and likes. He was the father figure she never had. Not even Micke filled that role, even though she liked and might have given herself to him, but he liked Erika more, disappointing her. I really like the fact that in the end she won and lived. I gave it five stars, but it should be a little lower. Say 4 1/2. Nevertheless, this is a great story. I loved the audio and the 16/9 ratio which fills the entire screen. I have had a 16/9 TV since 2003, but American film makers still insist on odd ratios that do not fill the screen. Who cares about all that stuff in the back ground? If it must shown do it as a panning shot while following the characters out of the scene.

4259331,5,B00440FO6M,"Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict --Now this is certainly different. When one hears that a film clocking in at 152 minutes is getting an additional 30 minutes added to its runtime, it can be off-putting, no matter how good the original may have been. When that same extension is applied to an entire trilogy, it can become a somewhat daunting task. The simple fact is that most people just don't have three hours to sit and watch a movie all that often. So with that in mind, it is both refreshing and reassuring to find The Dragon Tattoo Trilogy reconfigured as a TV miniseries, with each film broken into two 90-minute episodes.

First of all, this change of format not only doesn't harm the material, it actually enhances it. Given the extra room to breathe, the films are both richer and a much more palatable proposition. Whether by chance or design, each of the films also has a natural break-off point, where each episode can draw to a close; this allows the viewer to take in each story in easily digestible chunks whilst ensuring they are left desperate to find out what happens next. It's also important to stress that the story still maintains its cinematic feel.

Presented as one long six-part series, the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition is broken down into three distinct sections, thus allowing the viewer to watch each film independently of the rest.

Each film in the trilogy is presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer, which obviously means the The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been cropped to fit with the aspect ratio of its sequels. This really makes little difference, however, and still delivers a fine-looking picture, with natural colors, high levels of detail, and solid blacks. The viewer has the choice of playing the movie in either its native Swedish, or, for those with an aversion to subtitles, English. Both options provide a clean, nicely balanced 5.1 mix.

This four-DVD set contains each film on separate discs, with the fourth disc reserved for supplemental materials. The bonus disc delivers two hours of features, and begins with ""Millennium: The Story."" Clocking in at 48 minutes, this documentary actually focuses on author Steig Larsson, and is an excellent insight into his work. Both Noomi Rapace, and her co-star Michael Nyqvist are each interviewed in separate featurettes, whilst notable members of the cast and crew also get to discuss the film in a further set of interviews. ""Nidermann vs. Roberto"" focuses on a fight scene from The Girl who Played with Fire. Finally there is a selection of trailers for each of the films.

4259332,5,B00440FO6M,"Received the blu-ray extended edition from Amazon.ca (Canada) on Nov. 25th.  Pre ordered in September.  This is likely the same product that will be shipped in the States as the sticker on the front mentions over 2 hours of additional footage not seen in the US.  The back of the box states that ""this complete version of the international hit series restores notable characters and subplots, most significantly in the portrayal of Erika Berger"".

Each movie is on its own disc, and split between Part 1 and 2 for each movie.  I assume that is how it was shown on Swedish TV.  I've never seen the movie versions so I can't tell what the differences are in content.

All 3 features are available with the original Swedish language with English subtitles or an English language version.

The fourth disc has the special features and is 2 hrs, 2 minutes long.  It includes a 53 minute documentary detailing the phenomenon of the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and the personal history of Stieg Larsson.

I've only watched the first disc and enjoyed it very much.  Can't wait to watch the rest!",1322352000,131,1081,4.696808510638298

Understand English version 'Dragon Tattoo' is in the works, don't see how any actors will quite match Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth Salander and Michael Nyqvist's Mikael Blomkvist character portrayals in the title roles . . . but I'll go see. A bit disappointed that there's no news of filming for the other two books, as the same actors must be used for the main characters to maintain the Trilogy's continuity.

I even went to Google Earth and saw some location tours that people who like the books created for that program.  But seeing all the scenery on the DVD's made the whole trilogy experience as complete as it can get without going to Sweden.  As is the case with mose movie adaptations, much of the story in the book was left out, some of the events changed but overall it is pretty close to what happens in the books.

All the disks are dubbed into English, so non-Swedish speakers won't have to spend the whole movie reading subtitles.  Since all three books are being turned into movies by Hollywood, which I probably will also go see, it was nice to see the whole trilogy on film without waiting the years it will take to get the US ""remakes"" released.

I think anyone who liked the books will also like this miniseries.",1318377600,,942,4.385057471264368

The two main characters, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist were superbly cast, exactly as I pictured  in the books. I had the option of selecting english subtitles or voiceovers. The first dvd (Dragon Tattoo), I watched with subtitles, the next two with english voiceovers. Both were very effective in portraying the emotional content when needed. I highly recommend purchasing the dvd set whether you have read the books or not.",1314576000,2,571,5.010526315789473
4259357,2,B00440FO6M,"These books were so gripping and entertaining, I was really excited to see that the Swedish version of the movies was available and ordered the set of movies with my last book of the series. As both my husband and I had read the first two books at this point, we watched the first two movies while reading the last book. What a major disappointment that whole story lines were omitted and events changed, presumably to accommodate the reduced time necessary for a movie. The casting was another let-down. Noomi Rapace, to me, was wooden and sullen, though I found many more emotions in Lisbeth Salander's character. The whole thing was apparently produced with a budget for a made-for-tv movie, so out of the country scenes were eliminated or ignored.
I would have been much happier watching the movies if I hadn't read and had no intention of reading the books. I also would have sat through a mini-series based on each book that followed the storyline more faithfully. We are fans of foreign films and routinely watch sub-titled films, but did opt for the dubbed version with the last two of the series. Ordinarily I would expect the Swedish version to be truer to the subject matter, but now will see at least the American version of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' to see it they've done it better.",1314489600,5,1304,4.64935064935065

I loved the character of Lisbeth Salander and to me, Noomi Rapace captured her very well. Watching them dubbed may have taken a little away from the movie, but reading subtitles was worse because it kept me from really seeing the movie. My biggest complaint about dubbing is that you don't get the actor's real emotions like you would if you were watching the originals. I would recommend the books read too, they have so much more than could have ever been put into each movie.

LOVED the books, and probably would have been fine with out these except I rented the first one thru iTunes to watch on a plane trip. I don't really buy many movies. I usually get them on demand, ppv, or rent online.

That was about a year ago, and at the time the second two weren't available on iTunes, so I just forgot about them.

When I saw the new trailer for the American version, I decided that the first of the Swedish productions was so good that I better get all three.

I'm so happy I did.  These are fantastic movies.  I like to watch them in Swedish with English subtitles, but there is an English dub on them too.  The box set is really nice too. It was really simply designed.

If you've read the books, you know how busy they are. Don't expect these movies to be a direct play-by-play of the books. Instead, appreciate them for how much they actually did manage to get into them.  They did way better than most book-based movies.  I was kind of sad some of the details were left out, but at the same time I know that the movies would be probably 5 hours each if they were able to explain everything.

All in all, very very happy with them.",1312848000,5,1236,4.217021276595744

This movie has subtitles, so get your glasses and settle down to read.  Mercifully, the movie isn't nearly as wordy as the book.  The 'what' of the story is told perfectly well, the 'why' you can only get from the books.

There wasn't a lot of 'emotion' in the movie, just the facts with a little bit o' sex on the side.  Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander) was so perfectly cast, it was amazing.

Anyone who watches this movie, please let me know how the character of Mikael Bloomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) gets the ladies.

Well, I was very disappointed. The plot followed the book fairly closely - too closely, actually.  In a book, the author can jump around to different parts of the story without losing the reader.  That doesn't really work too well with a movie.  A movie needs to flow.  If I hadn't read the books, I would have had a hard time figuring out the plot. Then, add to that the fact that the dubbing was terrible.  The mismatch was distracting, adding to the difficulty in following the story.

I gave the trilogy 3 stars because there was some good action and it was entertaining to a degree.  However, my suggestion is to skip the movies and just read the books.",1311638400,2,832,4.421052631578948

The movies are very well done with amazing acting.  Noomi Rapace is simply perfect in the role of the misfit Lisbeth.

The film completely entranced me from scene one, and I watched all 3 movies in one sitting.  Lisbeth is a most unusual heroine and I loved her immediately.  Watching the documentary about Stieg Larsson will only deepen your appreciation of the films...made from the books he wrote only to garner finances for his true passion, fighting injustice in Sweden and elsewhere.

I also share the same trepidation about the American remakes.  The incredibly powerful subtlety blended with  equally powerful violence will never be as successfully created again, and shouldn't be in my opinion.  Daniel Craig is nowhere close to capable of stepping into the demands of his character.  Watch the originals, it's an experience you will never forget.",1309737600,,858,5.166666666666667

It also seemed that each of the characters were well acted; however, given that I don't speak Swedish, it's difficult to make such an assessment because the language barrier doesn't allow for a true assessment of the authenticism each actor gives to the respective character through the delivery of the diaologue.

Spoiler here so do not read any further if you do not want to know how the first movie ends. I will admit that the raw, graphich, and brutal depictions of the movie had me wondering if it was going to be just another formulaic slasher film.  The depictions of sadism and cruelty really bring to the surface emotions that run deep.  In particular it showed the serial killer in a very realistic way specifically how he would allow his victims one last glimmer of hope just so that he could watch their eyes go black with resignation.  Then as you get caught-up in the injustices in the film and you begin to feel anger and resentment the villian makes his get-away and gets into a wreck.  As a cause of the wreck the villian gets trapped in it and it begins to catch on fire.  At that point the Heroine (such as she is) comes up upon the scene in time to save the guy from a burning death.  She chooses to do nothing and let him burn to death. You justify her decision within yourself then the movie makes you realize that you have just participated vicariously in an act of vigilance by obmission.  The way in which the director achieves that is masterful.

Subtitles were easy to get used to after a short time.  The first DVD was just as I had read from the book.

The second...not so much.  Lots of stuff missing from the book, you would have to fill in the blanks if you knew to do that.

While winter conditions prevaled on the outside, we spent a weekend snuggled up with a blazing fire in the wood stove and a few bottles of red wine engrossed in the story and characters created by Stieg Larsson.  While I am not a great fan of sub-titled or dubbed movies, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We even watched the second movie with sub-titles (even though it was dubbed, as is the third movie)not wanting to break the spell these movies cast over us. The characters of Eisbeth Salander and Mikeal Blomkvist protrayed on screen are the characters as I imagined reading the novels. Noomi Rapace really brings Lisbeth to life with an intriguing and brilliant performance. The DVD package also includes a Bonus Disc of behind-the-scenes footage and the personal history of the author Stieg Larsson.

While the movies were great and added to the excitement and enjoyment of reading the novels, I must tell you that to get the ""full experience"" you just have to read the novels.  If you don't read the novels, you will surely miss alot of the intrigue, sub-plots and characters that will create the anticipation of wanting to see the movies.",1302220800,,1274,4.80365296803653
4259406,2,B00440FO6M,"There are several dozen reviews dealing with the movies (plot, direction, etc...), so I will limit my review to the quality of the Blu-ray transfer for the Trilogy box set alone.

Although the information given here on Amazon implies that all three films are done at 1.85:1 aspect ratio, in reality 'Dragon Tattoo' is transferred at 2.35:1, and the other two are done at 1.85:1. Not that this is an issue for me, but while 'Dragon Tattoo' is clear and razor-sharp, the other two films suffer from much compression artifacts. I suspect that these latter films ('Played with Fire' and 'Hornet's Nest') were shot at 2.35:1 and recomposed to 1.85:1, and the quality of the picture suffered terribly from it. The visible graininess is in your face, and distracting from time to time. I do hope that the release of the uncut Swedish originals (supposedly due sometime in 2011) are an improvement over this set.

I love the stories and the characters, and would have bought these regardless, but not one reviewer here makes mention of the video quality or the disparity of the aspect ratio's from the first film to the next two. For those who, like me, have come to take for granted the high-quality picture of the majority of BD movie releases, the second and third disc of this trilogy will come as a surprise, and as a disappointment.",1302134400,7,1330,4.728448275862069

My friend then advised that the books had been made into movies in Sweden! I had no option but to search for the movies starting obviously with amazon.com.

4259418,5,B00440FO6M,"Having seen all three movies in the original Swedish in theaters and having read all the books prior, I was pleasantly surprised at how effective this version was with dubbing.  Most of the voices suited the characters and despite what a purist might say, I found no distraction of having these in a language other than the one in which it was shot.  If you want the original, it's there.  If you want to hear it in English, it's there too.  Nice.

One criticism would be the special features.  Some are dubbed,some are not, and there should have been more of them for my liking. This series has developed such a huge audience, it has actually changed some of the economics of Swedish tourism. Why not something like that, and perhaps a tour of the locations and places mentioned in the book, preferably in English?

The producers did a great job with an obviously limited budget.  The writing was solid, but book fanatics will be disappointed to see some characters disappear and a number of relationships not developed because of the time constraints.  But these stand alone very well, and can be enjoyed whether there is prior knowledge of the book.

Great job, cast, crew and all. Stieg Larsson would have been proud - if disappointed his heirs are acting like some of the bad guys from his books.

It will be fascinating to see what David Fincher, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara do with the material.  Should be spectacular.",1301011200,,1427,4.664
4259419,4,B00440FO6M,The book trilogy involves a very complex story and I was very interesting in seeing how it would make onto film.

4259422,1,B00440FO6M,"The Stieg Larsson Trilogy, 2010 films

Stieg Larsson, a journalist, wrote three novels before his early death. They were published and then adapted into movies. There was the usual publicity to promote these foreign language films as some kind of entertaining or educational experience. They are not! While you might watch one of these, all three are worse than any one (negative synergy). They promise a story about a muck-raking magazine that exposes fascist sympathizers, serial killers, gun running, dope smuggling, pornography, and prostitution. But nothing about the tax evasion that accompanies these criminal enterprises. There isn't much of a scandal for an ""anything goes"" big metropolitan society. Many scenes are set in a rural small town. I wonder how well these movies did in Sweden?

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" has some X-rated scenes to shock or attract an audience. Parts seems derived from ""The Big Sleep"" (wealthy industrialist seeks a missing person), ""Chinatown"" (wealthy individual exploits a female relative), and ""Roseanne"" (finding the killer of a young woman). Larsson did enhance this combination, but the idea of a serial killer in a small rural village seems incredible. ""The Changeling"" was based on a true story.

""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" makes a heroine out of a violent mentally-ill young woman, who somehow becomes a millionaire swindler through her computer hacking. [Didn't ""The Sting"" have a similar story?] I find this incredible, most hackers are soon caught because of controls. This action movie has the usual scenes (car chase for action, a super-villain like from an Ian Fleming novel, characters who pop up to provide bodies or action). There are no prosecutions for the crimes.

""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is the end of this series. Lisbeth is the main character now, and shows the investigative skills of a private detective (""The Maltese Falcon""). There is a small independent conspiracy who covered up the crimes of a Cold War defector (""Operation Paper Clip""?). Some parts are educational, like planting evidence (drugs and money) to frame an independent journalist. It exposes a paid government expert witness who commits prosecutorial perjury in testifying on Lisbeth's sanity. [Doesn't this happen in other places?] Somehow, Lisbeth remains drug-free in spite of her aberrant lifestyle. Believable?

At the end there are no prosecutions for the crimes alleged to have occurred (gun running, dope smuggling, pornography, prostitution). I thought Sweden was ruled by its aristocracy and big industrialists against the common people (who suffer from the usual high taxes). I remember the books of Per Wahl and Maj Sjwall as being more entertaining and educational.

4259427,5,B00440FO6M,"In the name of ""National Security"" secret groups in any country on this earth have Carte Blanche to power, secrecy, abuse and manipulation.  That is the backdrop of this old fashion crime mystery drama or if you prefer: thriller. Buried deep into the dark past of then political rulers of Sweden, almost everyone who were in power from the Prime Minister to clergy, kept and protected the crimes of a former Russian spy and his gang of thugs involved with sex trade, murder and violence against women.

A secret agent is a dangerous job, even more so if the spy happens to be a sadistic wife-beating husband and your principal enemy is his own daughter who at only 12, did stand up to him and hurt him really, really bad.

The star of the show is Lisbeth Salander the eccentric, antisocial, introverted, abused and very early-matured young girl impeccably played by Noomi Rapace.  Lisbeth is seeking judgment or revenge in her own way, she does not trust anyone except Plague the hacker and Blomkvist, the Millennium investigating journalist.

Written by the amazingly talented and promising late Swedish writer Stieg Larsson who prematurely died in 2004 of a heart attack at only 50.  Sexual violence against women was his theme in this Millennium Series of best selling novels, first published in Europe in 2006.  Unfortunately he could not enjoy the remarkable success of his book publishing and now the sensation of the 3 outstanding films called: The Stieg Larsson Trilogy.

David Fincher is directing (2011) the American version of the first film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I can't think of any reason to re-make this extraordinarily executed and flawlessly acted Swedish-Danish produced film, but since Mr. Fincher is involved, whom I respect, and Scott Rudin producing, it can't go wrong and I can't wait to for the release date to be published.

It is a fantastic crime and punishment film with fascinating characters that have human dimensions, they are almost real and it feels like they could be your co-workers or neighbors.

""There is something rotten in .... Stockholm"" is how I would subtitle the three films and recommend to discover for yourself, what is that rotten thing, by embarking and enjoying this ride that never stops surprising.  Watching all three films one after another, for me it was an unforgettable film experience.",1299196800,10,2356,4.951776649746193
4259428,5,B00440FO6M,"If you have read the ""Girl"" trilogy by Stieg Larsson, then you MUST have this movie set. Although quite graphic for the American viewer, it is really mild for most Europeans. We definitely used the English-dubbed version for simplicity of enjoyment. Some of the original story lines from the books have been omitted, but taken as a whole the final films were not badly chopped. I'm not sure you could get every story line in a movie! Having read the books prior to seeing the film was a certain advantage for understanding the small nuances in my opinion. Salander is magnificent. Understand that when the American version comes out, Blumkvist will be played by Daniel Craig. Can hardly wait! Really enjoyed the films.",1299110400,,718,4.845528455284553
4259429,5,B00440FO6M,"I'm glad I waited for this handsome, slim boxed set of the entire Stieg Larsson trilogy instead of buying each title as it became available. I'd already read the 3 books, and I'd seen the first film (DRAGON TATTOO) in a theater, but then I waited until all 3 films were packaged together on DVD. I cleared my schedule for one long afternoon and evening, and I watched all 7+ hours in uninterrupted bliss. It really is the perfect way to experience this remarkable story.

I won't rehash the plots of the 3 films, but I must mention the fine direction, writing, production design, cinematography, music, and the terrific cast, particularly the two leads. Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are so perfect together that I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. (I wish Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara a lot of luck with the American remake--they have very big shoes to fill.) The scenery alone will have you booking the next flight to Sweden.

These DVDs are beautiful, with your choice of the original Swedish soundtracks with English subtitles or very well executed English-dubbed soundtracks. I prefer the Swedish--there's so much character detail conveyed by the actual actors' voices, even in a foreign language. And the extra DVD has 2 hours of documentaries, interviews and trailers. This trilogy of films (and books) is just about the best mystery series I've found in a long while. My only regret is that Stieg Larsson isn't around to bask in his well-deserved glory--and to continue the saga of Michael Blomqvist and Lisbeth Salander.

There is a question of a more ""complete"" version films later.  With money to be made, that is a real possibility but the definition of ""later"" and how much more film is an open question. An American adaptation of the story is in the works.  I do not think an American version will be able to capture the real feel of the story, as it exists here.
These films are a very hard R, full of nudity, sex and violence.  If that is upsetting, you should not buy this item.  This is an integral part of the story and not tacked on in an attempt to boost sales.  The three movies are independent films, watched together, they tell a single story.  If you buy one, chances are you will want all of them.  Each film has a Swedish language track with English subtitles and an English language track.  Each film is widescreen, preserving the full frame movie presentation.  Each DVD is in a full color illustrated holder housed in a box with a changing picture front.  The two-hour bonus disk contains a documentary, interviews and trailers for each film.  If your decision is to buy the set, this is the best purchase option.
This is an excellent story, well acted presented in a quality production.  The story is compelling and well crafted.  I enjoyed them the first time and will watch them again.",1298678400,27,1643,4.456375838926174
4259431,5,B00440FO6M,"Allow me to give you some advice on how to watch these three films. I've read the trilogy of books and I have watched all three of these films several times.

The first thing to understand is the first movie is its own story arc. It is fitting that it has a different director than the second two movies. This is because the second two movies themselves are a complete story arc in themselves in an important way. The first movie is said to be a little bit more different than the book than the other two which the second director handled in a little bit more of a literal way. Again, this suits the material. The first movie is a methodical police procedural getting to the heart of darkness  found in a corrupt soul. The second two movies reflect two movements that belong together in one symphony.  The first movement is an action adventure in which Lisbeth tracks down a mystery in the world and in herself and the second movement is her subsequent court trial - a trial that arises from  the circumstances that took place in the beginning of the  second film.

I think the first film really stands alone on its own feet. The second two films really should be watched one after another.  Watching the third film makes little dramatic or narrative sense if you come into it cold.  I introduced the series to my friends by playing the first movie. And then after they liked that, we agreed to get together on a Saturday and Sunday night to watch the second and third movie later on.

All three films were originally a good deal longer and were a miniseries on Swedish TV. But this is a great set and all three together tell as much of the story of this hypnotically repellent yet irresistible girl, (no, woman).

The first film is a little like what Hannibal Lecter would've looked like in real life, not pumped up into a fantasy how ever amazing. The second film is like a Socialist Chuck Norris going after the bad guys. And the third movie is like John le Carre taking a hand that writing a Gresham novel. Enjoy. (Have you ever heard of Red Riding?)",1298505600,17,2054,4.424403183023872
4259432,5,B00440FO6M,"I probably should have rated these three films separately, as I buy these films at different times, and not the trilogy that's being sold now; but it would have taken too much time for separate discriptions. And even though films 1 and 3 with a 4, and the 2nd film with a 5, I suppose that the overall rating is 4 1/2 stars. But the 5 stands because altogether, they're more than a 4.

I read the book ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo,"" however, I couldn't finish it. I thought the translation from Swedish to English was poor was too wordy before coming to the point of the story. But I was immediately drawn to the main character, Lizbeth Salander. Because of the first book, I didn't want to read the 2nd and 3rd. Plus, the book and the movie are sometimes so different, with the book usually being better than the movie. However, it's different in the case: I didn't like the book, but I certainly enjoyed the movie.

The second movie in this trilogy was the one I enjoyed the most. It was more exciting and engrossing; more the thrilling I thought. This is the one in which I fell in love with Lizbeth. I was really glued to the action which was not ""actioned out"". Some movies have too much action and no substance. Lizbeth is woman of few words, withdrawn, angry, her own person, and very brilliant. I was with her every step of the way, from the 1st movie to the last.

The third movie, I was very eager to see, and I thought it was better than the first movie. However, I did wish there was more interaction between journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) who was in more scenes with her in the first and second movies, but not in the last one. I missed this because he the only Real friend she had, and he loved her and believed in her innocence.

I truly enjoyed this series, and I hope Noomi Rapace we'll be seeing her in other films in the near future. I would love to see her in other kinds of roles to see how much her talent can be stretched. I'm sure she's a super star in Sweden now. She was terrific!!!",1296691200,9,2036,4.28051948051948
4259433,5,B00440FO6M,"THE STEIG LARSON TRILOGY is NOT the complete, uncut version of the Swedish TV presentation. I E-mailed B. Brown at MUSIC BOX FILMS, and he said that the uncut versions will be released later this year. As for the movies themselves, they are three of the best suspense / mystery / thrillers I've ever seen. Noomi Rapace (as Lisbeth Salander) dominates every scene she's in, from the opening, disappearance mystery of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO through the human-trafficking tale of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, and right through to the government conspiracy finale of THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, Repace is incredible! Her psychological complexity and toughness are fascinating! I can only hope that the US remake stays true to these stories...",1295222400,327,760,4.9921259842519685
4259434,3,B00440FO6M,"Ingmar Bergman meets Kill Bill in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", the first installment of the three films based on Stieg Larsson's posthumously published book trilogy. A brooding, atmospheric Swedish thriller, directed by Niels Arden Oplev, it's an intriguing mash-up of serial killer mystery and political conspiracy yarn. An investigative journalist (Michael Nyqvist) is looking into the decades-old cold case of a young woman (possibly murdered) who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The family involved has powerful political connections and a dubious history (something that frequently goes hand-in-hand). An elusive, enigmatic young computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) with her own tortured, secretive past (and a dragon tattoo) is also looking to investigate the family for personal reasons, and offers to help. Lisbeth's mission to expose the evil and corruption of the rich and powerful, and consequential travails have gained an interesting real world parallel with the ongoing Julian Assange caper. Well, so much for the good news. Unfortunately, something went horribly wrong with the two sequels, and I suspect the fault lies with director Daniel Alfredson, who took over for ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"". Despite the fact that Ms. Rapace's undeniable screen charisma remains intact throughout the trilogy, it cannot cover up the poor pacing, sloppy direction, and pedestrian writing that plagues the second and third parts. Normally, I abhor American remakes of European art house hits, but now I am intrigued to see David Fincher's revamp (the first installment is due out in 2011), because in this case, there is room for improvement.",1294358400,10,1729,5.503759398496241
4259435,3,B00440FO6M,"If you are a real fan of these films then you are probably aware that they were made originally for Swedish television and the versions released to theaters have been shortened to make their running times more palatable for audiences who are forced to keep their butts in their seats viewing these films during their theatrical release.  The films as shown on TV have a run-time closer to 3 hours, whereas the theatrical prints clock-in around the 2 1/2 hour mark.  It would have been nice if they had saw fit to release the unexpurgated versions in this complete box set, rather than the slimmer versions.

This collection is still a good deal...if you want to get all the films of the trilogy in one fell swoop and, though i haven't compared them to the single film editons to see if anything is new, it does appear that the 4th bonus disc has some good extras.  Myself, I'd rather wait until the longer versions get their inevitable release (this story has become too phenomenal for it not to) either on this side of the pond, or in a R2 version.

<UPDATE: Well, it took a year from my above disclaimer but the full-length versions of the films have finally been released here in the U.S. Was really just a matter of time that they'd eventually show up, but I know I'm glad I waited for them so I didn't have to double-dip on releases of these films. 01/12>",1292025600,422,1360,4.467741935483871
