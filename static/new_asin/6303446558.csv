657404,5,6303446558,"Suffice it to say I am a huge fan of this man, an understatement to say the least.

This DVD is a profound document, recorded almost twenty years ago as I write this. There is something particularly intense about this performance of standards; variety in material to be sure- but the detail he brings to these interpretations, whether meditative, bluesy-gospel or straight out swing improv of the highest calibre, is simply amazing. You will encounter much counterpoint in these interpretations, executed with a taste and flair Bach himself would praise.

At some point Jarrett seems to conjure the muse or whatever spririts motivate or infuse his playing in a seemingly comic wave of his hands and no wonder; every moment of this disc is pure inspiration, a joy to watch and an even greater pleasure to listen to. Considering much of his playing at this time (1987) involved his trio, this Tokyo performance reveals just how independent this singular musician/genius is, capable of sustaining the audience's rapt attention throughout the entire program.

A must have- in many ways more satisfying than most of his freer solo improv CDs, certainly more of an academic document for fans casual or devoted.",1174003200,2,1204,5.040201005025126
657405,5,6303446558,"I've listened to Jarrett for 30 years and no musician has meant more to me as a person who loves many genres, including jazz.  This is a gorgeous CD and it would be worth the full price to just for the ""Summertime"" track.

657406,4,6303446558,"Celebrating his 100th concert in Japan, Mr. Jarrett obviously came out with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. But it was the second half of the concert that amazed me so much, with the standard tunes like ""Round About Midnight"", ""Then I'll be Tired of You"", ""The Wind"", and especially ""Solar"", Keith played them more open than they were in the Trio, Motives just came one after another unstoppably. As a fact Keith hiself was amused by the inspiration along the tune and put on some ""magic shows"" after applause.
Comparing with CDs it might not be a perfect night, however, it's one of the best video documents available for Keith Jarrett.",1069372800,12,637,4.696428571428571
657407,5,6303446558,"I have many solo piano recordings, from James P. Johnson to Cecil Taylor. I can listen to Johnson and I can listen to Taylor. But for how long.
To my ear only Keith Jarrett has the ability to play such a variety of musical styles--and all of them so well--that I could listen all night long with no fear of boredom.
And though this solo recording is (for the most part) all standards and ballads, it never mires down like so many in this genre do. Jarrett's mastery of melody, harmony, rhythm, improvisation and ""composition,"" all couple up with--yet are never overwhelmed by--his incredible technique, and together these many facets of his genius take this recording to a level beyond any other recording of similar pieces. His playing here truly runs the gamut from the ethereal and sublime to the ""get-up-off-your-...-and-shake-your-body"" funky!
Listen, for example, to the way ""The Night We Called It A Day"" unfolds in ""novelistic"" fashion. It is as if you are sitting there listening to a beautifully haunting musical book unfold before you. Close your eyes and its beauty washes over you.
Or try ""Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me."" It is at times achingly restrained, simple, and beautiful; your ears will beg you to just sit down and listen. But then it changes, and suddenly his funky and bluesy left hand bumps into his dazzlingly speedy and bluesy right hand and your body is gonna demand that you to get up and boogie! Jarrett's regrettably-not-often-heard-but-amazing (""semi""?) stride piano ability comes to the fore here. You will not be able to erase from your face your grin of amazement. (By the way, I mentioned Jarrett's ability at ""composition"" above. Case in point, though the B section here is not the original--unless I am sorely mistaken--it is gorgeous, and melds perfectly with the rest of the piece.)
And though I am quite sure that the purists and traditionalists in the audience will criticize me with the greatest of gusto for the following comment, I believe Jarrett's solo version of ""'Round Midnight"" is the most beautifully poignant I have ever heard. (Yes, even including the wonderful recording of Monk composing the tune in the studio.)
Interestingly, Jarrett--dare I say it--actually loses it momentarily in ""'Round Midnight."" (Now it's the Jarrett die-hards chance to pounce on me!) The rhythm just falls apart. But, you know what? I could care less. Unlike Glenn Gould's belief that perfection, in part, awaited its creation in the editing room--and I personally believe that he was at least partially correct when one is recording classical music--Jarrett's ""perfection"" is that he will not play it safe, that he will reach and stretch, farther and farther, even to the point that he occassionally stumbles. It would be so easy for a musician of his ability to make a safe, mistake-proof recording. But he doesn't believe that that is what this kind of music is about. More power to him for being willing to fall in front of us unashamed. Thank you, Mr. Jarrett, for always taking that extra chance. It allows us a chance to hear what we otherwise never would. It is a blessing to be alive in a world with your music.",1041897600,22,3157,4.85899814471243
657408,5,6303446558,"The review below may be misleading. This is not the usual Jarrett solo epic. It is approx 100 mins of solo standards (except for one track which is probably an instant improvisation) and is recommended to anyone who is  looking for something else like the wonderful ""The Melody At Night,  With You"". I have only recently bought this video with only the review  below top go by and was surprised by the format as I didn't realise that he  had done the ""standards thing"" solo before.",947548800,10,481,4.558139534883721
7847984,5,6303446558,"Amazing!  Let me state up front that I don't like everything Keith does.  In truth, of the several CDs and vinyl albums I own, I like about 50% of what I hear.  BUT, that 50% is really good, and some of it is simply beyond words because of its beauty and downright awesome nature.  I like several other jazz piano players, but none can touch Keith when he is doing one of his inspired pieces.  This video is not perfectly photographed.  I guess I don't get what they were trying for by showing long stretches of his feet and his head.  Even when they show his hands they are often shot from below the edge of the piano--weird!  The music itself is incredible, and I like almost 90% of the music in this concert.  The man is a true genius, and I pity anyone who really likes music who has not experienced Jarrett when he is really cooking, as he is in most of this concert.  Yes his body language is unique to say the least, but that is apparently part of the creative process for Keith.  I can live with that when it comes with such incredible music.",1522454400,,1050,4.226130653266332
7847985,5,6303446558,"I have more Keith Jarrett recordings on my CD shelf than of any other musician.  I missed this one until recently because it is a DVD rather than an audio CD.  But it is a recording of a concert you won't find on any of his CDs.

It is an excellent set of jazz standards he performs solo.  Now I just need how to figure what's the best way to incorporate a video into my itunes library.

By the way, I hope there is an official recording of the Madrid 88 concert that they will release as a CD at some point- was just watching the bootleg video of that concert and it sounds pretty good.",1491696000,,587,4.025862068965517

7847989,5,6303446558,A great talent in a world where that word is thrown around. He should live forever and play music forever.

7847990,5,6303446558,"Als CD gibt es so etwas nicht - eine Solo-Klavier-Live-Aufnahme von Keith Jarrett, auf der (fast) ausschlielich Standards zu hren sind. Umso toller, dass es zumindest diese DVD von VideoArts Music gibt. Zeit wird's brigens fr eine Neuverffentlichung dieser DVD durch ECM (mit hoffentlich etwas satterem Sound!).
""Solo Tribute"" enthlt 100 Minuten feinste Klaviermusik. Anlsslich seines hundertsten Auftritts in Japan schenkt Jarrett seinem Publikum 14 wunderbare Interpretationen von Standards, hauptschlich aus den 1930er und 1940er Jahren. Gerne spielte und spielt er ja als Zugabe seiner Konzerte Standards und stellt hierbei sein immenses Interpretationsrepertoire unter Beweis. ""Over The Rainbow"" von der ""Last Solo""-DVD oder auch auf ""La Scala"", ""The Wind"" von der ""Paris Concert""-CD oder ""Time On My Hands"" vom ""Carnegie Hall Concert"" sind tolle Beispiele, aber auch das fantastische ""It's All In The Game"" von der Trio-CD ""The Out-of-Towners"".
Auf ""Solo Tribute"", aufgenommen im April 1987 in Tokyo, gibt er also - bis auf das Stck ""Sound"", das an den Stil von ""Dark Intervals"", drei Tage zuvor eingespielt, erinnert - nur Standards zum Besten, und das offensichtlich auch in allerbester Laune. Mehrfach ist zu sehen, wie Jarrett zwischen den Stcken mit dem Publikum scherzt oder Albereien treibt (etwa angedeutete Zaubertricks mit einem blauen Handtchlein). Diese gute Laune bertrgt sich auch auf sein Spiel. Es gibt keinen einzigen ""Ausreier"" nach unten, allesamt sind es groartige Stcke, ob sanft-trumerisch (z. B. in ""I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good""), dster-schwer (z. B. in ""Sound""), fetzig-jazzig (z. B. in ""I Love You"") oder groovig-bluesig (z. B. in ""Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me""). Eine ganz auergewhnliche ""Summertime""-Version mit treibender Grundlinie der Linken rundet das Konzert ab. Mein Highlight ist das Stck ""Solar"", eine spritzige Miles-Davis-Nummer, in der Jarretts stupende Technik ebenso offenbar wird wie seine groartige Spiellaune an jenem Abend.
Fr die Bilder ist Regisseur Kaname Kawachi verantwortlich. Er zeigt uns Jarretts ganzen Krpereinsatz am Piano, sein Gesicht, in dessen wechselndem Ausdruck sich jeweils sein Spiel spiegelt, seine Hnde, wie sie die Tasten streicheln oder heftig bearbeiten - und sein Mitsummen. Wer das bewusst ansieht, wird merken, dass dieses untrennbar mit dem Musikschaffen von Keith Jarrett verbunden ist. Fnf Sterne, logisch!",1332460800,,2396,5.658333333333333
7847991,5,6303446558,"Dear music lovers around the world,
I have been following K. Jarrett since he was a young man with Charles Lloyd. I remember listening to Forest flower sunrise Forest Flower Sunset by that group. As time went on he became my pianist of choice. Then years past and he did the Bremen/Lausanne concert and Koln solo's. Bremen / Lausanne is my favorite as I feel it is more robust and innovative.

As for this Solo in Japan. IT IS SO IMPROVISATIONAL AND FULFILLING TO WATCH!!!
WHAT WILL WE DO WHEN HE IS GONE I DO NOT KNOW. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME JUST BEING ABLE TO PLAY HIS MUSIC WHEN I NEED A LIFT ......or cd's like ""A Melody At Night With You""...so relaxing. He does it all.",1293840000,,678,4.2153846153846155
