7545025,3,B018DSA8ZW,"Hee Haw: Kornfield Klassics features two complete episodes from the early 1970s, seldom seen since their original broadcasts. Episode 45, originally aired on January 11, 1971, is from Season 2 and features Buck Owens and cast performing Loves Gonna Live Here; recording artist Roger Miller singing Dang Me and Thats the Way I Feel;  and Nashville Edition performing Break My Mind. Sketches include several installments of Moonshiners, Kornfield Jokes, KORN News, and Archies Barbershop. Yankees outfielder Bobby Murcer appears in several comedy sketches with Junior Samples.

Episode 48, also from Season 2 (originally aired on February 2, 1971) spotlights country superstar Loretta Lynn performing her signature songs Coal Miners Daughter and Secret Love. Other performances include Buck Owens and cast singing Gonna Roll Out the Red Carpet; country music songwriter Whisperin Bill Anderson performing Wild Week-End and I Love You Drops; and Ray Clark performing January, April and Me.

Hee Haw debuted on TV in 1969 as a summer replacement for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Each week co-hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark and the cast of comedians and musicians would welcome the biggest stars in country music to perform their songs and help deliver the one-liners. Conceived as a rural alternative to Rowan and Martins Laugh-In, Hee Haw ranked in the top 20 nationwide in 1971 when CBS cancelled it in an attempt to steer the networks programming to a more sophisticated demographic. It was quickly picked up for syndication and ran through the early 1990s.",1454803200,12,1562,5.290322580645161
