2054729,1,B0002234I6,Extremely dull and boring. Shows incidents that are not very funny at all. Most of them are just small slips or mistakes while talking..That are not even funny. Dont waste your time or money. Please,1317168000,,198,4.685714285714286
2054730,3,B0002234I6,"The program is funny but I wasn't exactly cracking up through the whole thing.  Some of the footage is priceless like Bush Sr. going down in that bowling alley, Dukakis falling off the platform and everything from Dan Quayle.  I was really hoping for more of the video of Clinton and Yeltsin laughing uncontrollably.  It appeared in the opening credits for about 2 seconds.  It's advertised on the back of the case for cryin out loud!  Some of the footage isn't funny at all.  It's been awhile since I've seen any bloopers video so I completely forgot about the stupid and annoying sound effects they add in.

The technical aspects of the program and DVD are the real let-downs of this.  The volume level of the audio isn't constant and I found myself turning the volume up and down throughout the whole thing.  The video source they used is a dark print, making me almost squint through some of it.  Disappointing it's less than 40 min.  They could have CERTAINLY included an extra feature with bloopers from Dubya (this video was originally made in '99).  They could do a whole program on him alone.  Or just a review of his presidency, the biggest presidential blooper of all time.",1222732800,3,1184,4.634615384615385
2054731,5,B0002234I6,"If you like watching political bloopers and dumb mistakes, then this is absolutely for you.

I love it, I have watched it over and over and still laugh.

A great gift for someone that likes comedy!",1193270400,3,197,4.444444444444445
2054732,1,B0002234I6,"There are a few funny things in this video, but there's only about 3 that you can really see right because the pictures on this video move so quickly that you are always barely glimpsing what might be going on.  Or else it's something that's not even funny.  I would say DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY, because they have the pictures spinning from one setting to the next so fast that you don't even have time to laugh.",1107216000,4,416,4.32051282051282
2054733,3,B0002234I6,I teach government and hoped this would be a fun counterpoint to the course and text.  It was fun for about 10 minutes. The fun quickly gave way to the mundane.  It was educational in it own way:  Nancy Reagan and Margaret Thatcher are spazzes that should wear sensible shoes or combat boots and stay away from high heels. I guess they did have more in common than their affections for Ronnie.,1041206400,3,393,4.430555555555555
2054734,1,B0002234I6,"Pretty much a wast of time.  There is less than 5 mins of funny video on this 40 min tape.  Most of the ""bloopers"" are brief, awful, and with lots of stupid intro, pretty much like the worst of the TV shows.  Barely worth watching once.",975888000,17,236,4.086956521739131
2054735,5,B0002234I6,"Get ready to laugh.  I loved this video.
You will want to watch this one again and again.  From Ike all the way up to Clinton, you'll see Ford falling, Bush bumbling and Reagan mixing it up in this hilarious video.
It has it all... for example... The physical -- falling off podiums and falling down stairs.  Microphone bumps to the head and falling down bowling alleys.  The verbal -- oops, was this microphone on?  ""We're trying to get unemployment to go up, and I think we are going to succeed"" (Reagan)  ""You have to go forward to the past, to go past to the back"" (Quayle).  And just the downright funny -- Cinton and Yeltsin catching a case of the uncontrollable giggles.
You will not be disappointed.",973555200,27,707,4.4765625
2054736,5,B0002234I6,One word descibe this movie HELARIOUS! Seeing different presidents doing funny things is too funny. Plus watching their reaction!,963532800,11,129,5.842105263157895

8020141,1,B0002234I6,An obnoxious host and idiotic sound effects completely ruin this. I picked it up at a thrift store for less than a buck and couldn't even sit through it all.,1435622400,,157,4.266666666666667
8020142,5,B0002234I6,"This was playing in a variety store while we were visiting Washington, D.C.  We couldn't find a copy in the store so was very pleased to be able to find it on-line.  Husband loved it.",1405468800,,183,4.2
8020143,5,B0002234I6,"Excellent DVD about our presidents and their wives.  I did not realize there were so many bloopers from the past.  A few of them were before my time but still very funny.  It was surprising to see how many of them made a klutz of themselves and bounced right back as if nothing happened.  It was a beautiful ending with ""America The Beautiful.""  A very fitting postlude for our presidents and their wives.",1401148800,,405,4.493150684931507
8020144,5,B0002234I6,This gift was purchased for a father's day present for my father.  We watched the whole thing.  Very funny DVD.,1373760000,,111,4.5
8020145,5,B0002234I6,Being president of the U.S. is a larger than life role.  It's also easy to forget that they are human too.  It just seems so much funnier when people of this status make mistakes.  It did contain several repeats.  But overall it was pretty funny.,1355097600,,246,4.4
8020146,2,B0002234I6,I saw a bloopers video in a gift store in washington dc which was very funny.  they were sold out and i thought this was the samen one.  well it's not.,1354579200,,151,3.838709677419355
8020147,3,B0002234I6,The title says it all!  One or two laughs but that's about all I can say.  You will like the jokes about the politicians you did not like to start. But it is not as funny as I had hoped it would be.,1334275200,,198,3.5813953488372094
