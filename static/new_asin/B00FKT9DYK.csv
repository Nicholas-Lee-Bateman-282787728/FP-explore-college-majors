I went in thinking that I probably would not like it, but I love Jane Austen stories so I gave it a try. I am glad that I did. I was laughing the whole time. It's just so goofy that it works. Don't expect it to be historically or even Jane Austen accurate in any way. Just have fun!! I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD or Blue-Ray for so long.",1386460800,36,481,3.7254901960784315
5996254,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Really loved Shannon Hale's original novel ""Austenland"" and was thrilled to hear that they were making a movie! Although the movie deviates from the book in several aspects it didn't make me like it any less. Such a delightfully funny movie full of an eclectic cast that delivers smiles and laughs throughout! A fan already of Keri Russell, Jane Seymore, and JJ Field I was excited to see them all together. Jennifer Coolidge is quotable and keeps you laughing even after the movie is over! For anyone the least bit obsessed with any facet of Jane Austen's world this movie will keep you laughing for days and want to share it with all your girl friends!",1386201600,30,654,4.646551724137931
5996255,1,B00FKT9DYK,"Hmmm... A young American woman is so obsessed with Jane Austen that she has decorated her bedroom with a life-size image of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in the BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" plus she has doilies, pillows, flowers, ribbons, dolls, and other frilly, girly stuff right out of Austen's books. In this PG-13 cringe-worthy calamity, our fixated sweet thing finds a British theme tour devoted to All Things Austen, so thither she goes! In my personal opinion, this dame has a screw loose.

Writer/director Jerusha Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite"") has assembled a sterling cast (numerous awards and honors), then subjected them (and us) to this lame offering.

I blushed for:
  * Keri Russell (""August Rush"") is Jane, ready to spend her life savings just to experience a Jane Austen moment. Problem is, she can't afford the premium tour, so is assigned a small room in the servants' wing at Pemberly.
  * JJ Feild (""Northanger Abbey"") is Mr. Henry Nobley, who immediately starts giving off antagonistic vibes to our heroine (hint, hint). As you can see, Mr. F. already has credibility in an Austen story.
  * Jennifer Coolidge (Lots of TV) is Miss Elizabeth Charming, a daffy, obscenely rich guest at Pemberly. Not even Coolidge with her considerable talent could save this thing.
  * Jane Seymour (""The Family Tree"") is Mrs. Wattlesbrook, the proprietress of this ridiculous venture. She hasn't a benevolent bone in her body.
  * Bret McKenzie (TV series ""Flight of the Conchords"") is Martin, the handsome stable hand who offers Jane a friendly shoulder.
  * Ricky Whittle (Lots of TV) looks for all the world like the guy in the Old Spice commercial; this strapping fellow rips off his shirt at the slightest provocation...and we're glad he does...small blessings. ...smile...

Did I rate it? Yes - WSF (Worst So Far, which I've only used one other time this year) based on script, plot, acting and production design. I realize that all the stuffed chickens, peacocks, lambs, etc., were supposed to look phony, but these were insultingly so! I hated the fake birth of the colt and I cringed at the awkward references to ""Emma,"" ""Persuasion,"" ""Sense & Sensibility,"" etc., etc., etc...

The young, estrogen-stoked women in the screening audience were vocal and upbeat throughout this ordeal; they applauded (!) at the end, while I apologized to my companions for subjecting them to this travesty. I enjoy Chick Flicks, but this one is in a league of its own. YOYO (You're On Your Own) Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can warn my JayFlix.net folks.",1384473600,16,2574,4.909930715935335
5996256,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Comedy is never just black and white. There is a certain talent to getting it ""right."" Some movies go for the classy sort and in turn, earn viewer's gratitude. Others shoot for the wild and crazy, the sort that is lumped into the slaphappy. This Austen-inspired comedy of errors opts for the latter and the question on everyone's mind is, does it work?

Being a 30-something who lives a mundane existence and cannot keep herself from loving Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is not something that endears Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) to the game of dating. Her friend is concerned Jane just wants the fantasy. But really, her love of all things Darcy isn't that bad... okay, so it is a bit obsessive which prompts Jane to strike a bargain with Molly. First she books a trip to Austenland an all-inclusive Jane Austen experience run by Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour), and if, upon her return she realizes regency life is just that, a fantasy, she'll give up her dreams of finding her own Darcy. With ticket in hand, Jane books a flight to London and lands smack dab in the middle of every girl's dream.

Once there, Jane befriends Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) and strikes up a friendship with the groundskeeper, Martin (Bret McKenzie). When she's thrown together with the moody and arrogant, Henry Nobley (JJ Field), Jane sees the faux in her childhood dreams. Ever since she set foot on Austenland's grounds, everything about being the heroine in her own Austen story has been an act... or has it?

Right up front, let me say that I had conflicting thoughts on this book-to-screen adaptation. Only my love of all things Austen-at-the-cinema kept me glued to theater openings related to 'Austenland.' Unfortunately, it didn't open at the most convenient of theaters, however we made a day out of it - and oh, my, what a fun adventure it was. Put thoughts of a proper, regency saga out of your mind; unlike the dialogue Jane Austen would have penned, this comedy is awkward and amusing over how funny it tries to be. Jane wove some subtle albeit wickedly good humor into her stories - satire with class, whereas this contemporary script makes many concessions to adapt to its 21st century characters. You've been warned. With that being said, I can in no way fault 'Austenland' terribly much since it inserts a modern girl into a world she only thought was her ""perfect"" ideal.

While this was setting itself up, one of the first things that stood out was the warp speed at which the script unfolded. We were barely given time to process Jane's addiction before she was jetting off to England. Little explanation is given as to the ""why"" behind neither Jane's shy, comfortable life nor the way she immerses herself in all things 1800s. Secondly, I cannot say how impressed I was with the cast. Initially, it may line up as a mish-mash of talent - veteran actors, unknowns and British talent, it's in the actual watching of the film that we quickly learn how well they work together. The entire cast doesn't just create some fun chemistry none of them seem uncomfortable with the fun dialogue or acting silly to make the audience laugh with glee - something the people in the showing I saw did plenty of! This wouldn't be a complete assessment of thoughts if I was negligent in mentioning the ending; I lovelovelove the ending (preceding the closing titles) of this film. Not because it was unique or any different than the ordinary script, but because it was sweet and the actors played it so charming, it created its own brand of special.

Bottom lining it, 'Austenland' is a delightful film that I look forward to re-visiting on DVD. Between some catchy, terrific music, throwbacks to well-known Austen scenes or dialogue  (like a humorous caught-in-the-rain scene) and its refreshing cast, the movie is hard not to like. It's a refreshing turn after so many end-of-the-world box office picks - its part study in a contemporary woman, part whimsical and outrageous comedy. As I've yet to read the novel of the same name (it has suddenly moved up on my TBR pile), I cannot say how well the screen transfer was, however I quite adored everything about the film. There is more good to it than merely feeding Austen obsessions; the story is also careful to help us realize that even the best-laid fantasy is not necessarily better than reality - and it's admirable to see Jane standing up for herself, distinguishing between fiction and fact is necessary to keep ones sanity and she does it well. When we see the change in Jane at the end - a more confident person, it makes even the silly moments worth it.

From the crazy shenanigans to the absurd playacting and accents (courtesy of Georgia King and Jennifer Coolidge, respectively), 'Austenland' was a joyous journey, from beginning to end!

5996257,5,B00FKT9DYK,"LOVED this movie! Poor Jane Hayes (Kerri Russell) gets to have that dream of getting away from it all and going to her dreams. Just to find out it really isn't a dream but a whole lot of different things. It became a reality she was unprepared for. Imagine going from cars and cellphones to horse and carriage, dressing for the 1800's, trying to adopt the manners of the 1800's. Jane steps into that world with a planned vacation and meets up with a handsome stable man who may or may not be her Mr. Darcy. Meanwhile, the guy who plays the role of Mr. Darcy isn't as he seems either. Actors hired to play characters from Pride and Prejudice. Contrast the actors  in one scene to another involving a swimming pool.  Toss in a raunchy tune and some raunchy reading (Jennifer Coolidge) here and there and you'll wonder if you weren't somehow caught in the twilight zone. Somehow, it all works out. The script is brilliant and all of it is very well played. Be prepared to laugh at yourself if you are a Jane Austen fan. Most women will probably enjoy this movie. Don't worry guys... others of the male gender also found themselves laughing as well.  Congratulations and thank you  to the writer, director, and actors of this brilliant movie. And I should say thank you to Stephanie Meyer for producing this. (Not a big fan of hers but I will give credit where it is due).",1384300800,74,1368,4.46

Yeah, it's definitely silly, but as an actor, what hooked me is the very real chemistry between the Keri Russell and JJ Feild. Feild was perfectly cast as the Mr. Darcy character.

5996278,4,B00FKT9DYK,"Not to be taken seriously under any circumstances.

For fans of Jane Austen books and movies based on them, this is a fun break with more heart than similar modern world-meets-Austen stories (like ""Lost in Austen""). In this movie, a hardcore Jane Austen fan (also called ""Jane"") spends her savings on an immersive Austen vacation, where she plays a role in her own love story complete with English countryside mansion, regency costumes, and actors cast as archetypal Austen mancandy. But since this immersive experience is just as much about wish fulfillment as it is about accuracy, the Captain Wentworth stand-in is played by Ricky Whittle and will take off his shirt with very little provocation. I'm pretty sure none of Austen's heroes ever displayed their six-packs in the original books, but then again, I also don't remember the part in Pride and Prejudice where Darcy went for a swim then ran into Elizabeth while he was still soaking wet. In Austen's time, even seeing a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves would have been scandalous, and yet every Austen movie somehow manages to throw that scene in. Go figure.

Keri Russell is cute and nerdy, while JJ Fields looks great in period garb as ever. The soundtrack takes a leaf out of Sofia Coppola's book and pairs 80s tunes with candy-colored regency vignettes in a way that works oddly well. However, the show is absolutely stolen by Georgia King as Lady Amelia. She goes hilariously overboard with her english-rose character, poking loving fun at how ridiculous courtly manners would actually be to modern sensibilities.",1518566400,2,1576,5.011450381679389

I howl from start to finish and it is a true delight with a stellar cast who really make you fell like you're completely immersed. J.J. Feild was an amazing and adorable male hero, and Keri Russel is well all of us. Jennifer Coolidge's character was hilarious and my favorite! I frequently quote her lines in the film, that's how much I adore it! Jane Seymour's character isn't too likable but she did amazing and there is one scene where it looks like she is trying to keep a straight face but there's a little smirk. Everything is just amazing and it's one of my favorite films! They left out quite a bit from the book but as someone who saw the film first, I didn't mind and enjoyed the film a little more than the book. Oh and the soundtrack is great!",1501459200,,883,4.2

To be honest, I read some of the 1-star reviews and wondered what their mental health history is. I don't mean that in a mean way. I'm just saying that, if someone is offended by this movie, they are taking themselves - and life - way too seriously. I understand caring about injustice in the world, but this is not it. Granted, you have to be able to enter into the concept of parody. But, honestly, for a serious Jane Austen fan (as I am: the BBC adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice is my favorite movie. I write romance novels. I am on historical writer's loops. I love historical mystery), it would be one's fantasy to spend a week on the set of a regency or Victorian re-enactment with some handsome dudes. This just takes that fantasy a step further and turns it into a comedy. A very good comedy with a unique, high concept premise and not the usual cliches. For me, it had the best of everything: historical sets, awesome premise, sweet heroine I could relate to, handsome (and intelligent) hero - and several great villains! And lots of laughs.

It may seem intimidating to those who can't stand Austen or period pieces by the cover, but it mocks the cliches of its own subject with a fresh and clever humour that can be enjoyed by any audience. The amazing acting amplifies the obnoxious characters and bizarre situations without allowing the movie itself to become obnoxious.

It's completely analogous to the Trekkies - really good material for comedy; Galaxy Quest come to mind - one of the funniest movies ever.  I kept looking for parallels, but this movie didn't really have much to do with the Austen stories.  It quickly morphed into a girl-meets-boy, love boat type romance story that was completely corny, predictable, yawn-inducing.  Jennifer Coolidge is a funny character, playing a supporting role as she did in Legally Blond.  There weren't many funny lines in this movie but one was the Coolidge character saying ""I think being creative is a waste of time and money""  I gave it 3 stars out of respect for Jane Austen.",1485475200,,741,4.705426356589148

5996599,3,B00FKT9DYK,"I won't lie. This movie is incredibly cheesy and predictable. However, it is also cute, funny, and has chemistry between the leads. Any fan of Jane Austen will enjoy this as long as you are not expecting an Oscar worthy picture. You get what you get.

Keri Russell plays a Jane Austen addict who compares her love life to that of Austen's famous couples, most notably Elizabeth and Darcy. This has resulted in a lonely life with only a cardboard cut out of Colin Firth. Enter her friend who agrees she should go to Austenland, an expensive resort designed to immerse it's guests in a true Austen experience in hoping it will eventually detox her from her obsession.

I will say the book the film is based on is slightly more believable, although not quite as adorable. Russell is able to humanize the main character who might otherwise cross into an unlikeable character.",1476662400,,871,4.686274509803922
5996600,5,B00FKT9DYK,"If you are a fan of Jane Austen works or of the movies, this is a must-see. There are more than a few parts where I laughed out loud until I cried.

5996617,4,B00FKT9DYK,"OK, this movie is not going to win any awards. That said, our entire family found it hilarious. Initially, we picked it because my daughter and I really enjoy anything to do with Jane Austen. Ultimately we loved it because it was over-the-top ridiculous. So many funny parts - both intended and not - had both sexes around the tv laughing hard.",1476057600,,344,4.564516129032258
5996618,5,B00FKT9DYK,Absolutely loved watching this movie,1475971200,,36,6.4
5996619,5,B00FKT9DYK,"This was a fun movie. As a huge Jane Austen fan, I just really enjoyed the premise - in a way it is a classic Jane Austen romance. Our heroine is basically a Jane Austen out of control fan, reality comes crashing down around her when she spends her life savings on a Jane Austen immersion vacation. Acting was great, and it was very funny. I can honestly say there were parts that had me truly laughing out loud (so hard, tears in my eyes!).  This is a great, light romantic comedy also Jennifer Coolidge and James Callis are a riot.

Update: Movie vs Book.
Okay, I had not realized that this movie was based on a book. So I promptly read the book, it's a quick read and I have to say my review as written stands. Although the book was very nice, the basic story is the same and honestly, if they followed the book too closely, I think the movie would have been a little boring. Often, when you love a book, you are a little disappointed in the movie version, I believe mostly that has to do with the inability to fit in all the details a book can within 90 - 120 minutes. This movie was a great balance and I think a better story,",1475884800,10,1131,4.136363636363637
5996620,1,B00FKT9DYK,So stupid. Not even close to the book and they added a lot of vulgarity.,1475884800,,72,3.8666666666666667

5996759,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. If you are a Jane Austen fan, and don't mind a little fun being had at Austen's expense, you should love this movie.

One thing to understand about the movie, the acting is supposed to be cheesy once she enters Austenland. The other two women are just customers like her, they aren't supposed to be actresses so their ""pretending"" to be British is meant to be BAD. And the men are supposed to be theater actors so of course they would be a little over the top. It makes sense once you get the premise of the whole movie.

If you are a fan of the book (which is also a lot of fun to read), I would say this is more like a movie inspired by the book rather than an actual adaptation of the book, because they changed a lot of plot and history for the movie. There are things that happen in the book represented in the movie though, just don't expect it to be exact. For example, the whole reason and way she ends up in Austenland is completely different in the movie version.

Overall, I love having this movie on in the background to listen to while I do various things or anytime I need an escape myself.",1465948800,,1134,4.192660550458716

5996772,4,B00FKT9DYK,"Many reviews focus on how faithful this adaptation is  to the novel; I haven't read the book, so I can only judge it on its own merit as postmodern pastiche of all the Austen movies that have come before.

Synopsis: Jane Hayes is obsessed with all things Austen. She is in her thirties and has a string of failed relationships behind her because obviously no real man can measure up to wet shirt fantasy Darcy. So she decides to blow her money on an Austen immersion holiday in England. Once arrived in the Austen resort she realizes that the experience doesnt quite live up to her expectations. She learns that she has only booked the copper package, so instead of in a sumptuous bedroom she is stuck in the attic, and the clothes she is provided with look like something Mary Bennet might have worn, instead of the sparkling dresses from the movies. Worst of all, she comes to realize that the other guests have little to no idea of Jane Austens books or about the rules and etiquette of the period. Soon she gets tired of the rigid rules set by Mrs. Wattlesbrook, the manager of the resort, and starts a flirtation with Martin, the stable hand while at the same time becoming intrigued with Henry Nobley, one of the actors, who plays a Darcy-like character. On the eve of the final ball she comes to realize that she has been confusing fantasy with reality and decides to travel home. Alas, this could have been the perfect ending, but instead she ends up with Mr. Right after all, undermining all the questioning of Austen-Mania that film has done.

For me the main pleasure of this movie are all the references, allusions and intertextualities to most any previous Jane Austen adaptions. On the level of actors we have James Callis (Colonel Andrews) who played Tom, one of Bridgets friends in both Bridget Jones movies. Then we have Rupert Vansittart (Mr. Wattlesbrook), who essentially plays the same role as in the BBC version of P&P, where he was the mostly inebriated husband of Mrs. Hurst, one of Bingleys sisters. And last but not least we have JJ Field (Henry Nobley) who was Henry Tilney in the 2007 version of Northanger Abbey. Although he plays the somewhat smoldering figure of Mr. Darcy in Austenland, it turns out that he is much more like Tilney in character in the end than Darcy.
The very first scene, where Jane is shown in college with her friend Molly appears to allude to Clueless, Amy Heckerlings modern reinterpretation of Emma, transplanted to a Californian highschool. The influence of Bridget Jones can be seen in the storyline as well as in scenes: like Bridget, Jane is a thirty something, surrounded by friends who already have a life partner and who have started their own families. She, meanwhile, seems not to have found Mr. Right yet and her past boyfriends seem to be jerks. Later on, when she is already at Austenland, her boat excursion recalls the one Bridget had with Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). And the fight scene at the airport between Henry Nobley and Martin mirrors the one between Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and Daniel Cleaver. Not surprisingly, Martin seems to be a mixture of all the Mr. Wickhams and Daniel Cleaver, with his engaging charm and easy manners.
We have the rescue on a horse (Emma Thompsons and Ang Lees S&S), Lady Emilia Heartwright, who like Lucy Steele imparts an unwanted secret to Jane. Lady Emilia is in love with Captain East who went away as a poor sailor and returns as a rich captain.
We have the theatrical play for which Nobley (like Edmund) can only be reluctantly convinced to participate in the rehearsals; the play is staged in so unconvincing and exaggerated manner, that involuntarily we see before our eyes the comic performance of Pyramus and Thisbe by Shakespeares mechanicals.
The final ball, from which Jane escapes with Martin, seems to hark back to Polanskis The Fearless Vampire Killers, down to the dance moves with the little jump.

Practically every scene seems to contain a textual reference to and/or a visual allusion to one or more filmic adaptations of Jane Austens novels. I receive great pleasure in recognizing all these intertextualities, though I do ask myself how viewers who are not as intimately familiar with the cinematic adaptations of Austens work, experience this movie. But I guess it works as a romantic comedy without having to get all the cultural references, as a sort of post-modern pastiche that no longer needs an original.",1464998400,,4441,4.763636363636364

I read the book after I watched the movie and that's normally never a problem. However, I liked the movie much better than the book in many  regards. I liked the relationship between Jane and Miss Charming much better in the movie. I think their friendship was part of what made it so enjoyable.

5996858,4,B00FKT9DYK,"Cute predictable movie. Not sure if that was the point, since it is trying to be humorous about comparing things to pride and prejudice. The main part I didn't like was the ending. It seemed very cutoff and lacking more depth of character from the main characters. It just felt very unfinished and more like they just didn't know what else to add and where tired of filming.

So I wasn't expecting 21st Century Darcy, as apparently some were (but oddly enough, the main character was exactly that type of person).  I thought, though the script was lacking a bit, it was still pretty good, and I laughed hysterically at the play scene.  The main character learns a lesson and winds up with the person I'd hoped she would.  I like that in a movie.  I do have to say, that I got the disc through Netflix.

And I think I will end up buying it, as I need to laugh more, and it is also sweet and lots of fun and sometimes a bit outlandish!  I am an Austen fan and lover of Mr. Darcy, and this was so fun in its references to P&P at times, but in no way insults the original Austen story, but it is a riot!

Kerri Russell does such a great job of portraying someone totally obsessed but also someone who is so endearing that you are rooting for her throughout her ridiculous adventure.  Watching it again and again you catch more silly things or references. It's great.",1455494400,,432,4.863013698630137

I had read the book and found it entertaining and being a fan of Jane Austen's work I had to see the movie. It was not completely true to the book and I was irritated that they took such liberty in adding crude humor and the like which was not necessary for the story line AT ALL and was completely irrelevant. If you take out those parts it makes for a lovely entertaining movie. JJ. Feild and Keri Russell do a fabulous job of playing their rolls and yes, JJ Field could be a Mr. Darcy.

The Hess's have a special brand of humor and a way of showing the awkward and uncomfortable without deteriorating into gross or raunchy slapstick that keeps us coming back for more of their film creations. This movie is silly, sweet, and gives a clear message to the singleton in want of love, echoing the Jane Austen message, never judge a book by its cover and always choose the real and the deep over the shallow fantasy.

I just happened to catch it on cable one day and fell in love with it, leading me to purchase the DVD so that I can watch it whenever the mood strikes.  Yes, it's a romantic comedy, and it has its fair share of cheesy moments, just like any rom-com does.  But Keri Russell delivers a lovable heroine who lives in a fantasy world but is brave enough to separate the fantasy from reality when it really counts. In many ways, she is an exaggerated version of many of us - holding out for the version of love that we read about in books or watch in movies. And her love of Austen is one that many can relate to as well (although probably not to the same degree as her character!)

5997030,2,B00FKT9DYK,"There were a lot of good reviews for this film, and my wife and I love Jane Austen books and film adaptations, so it was a no-brainer. However, the film failed to live up to its excellent premise.
Jane Austen-enthusiasts deserve a true parody, because their numbers are legion and they truly would at least attempt to speak and act period-appropriate and with the wit with which Austen imbues her characters. However, much ""humor"" in this piece is about how only the main protagonist (and perhaps the Mr. Darcy figure) have even a basic understanding of Austen's world and concerns. The other two guests at Austenland are slobbering for man-flesh. The joke of ""sex-starved unattractive woman hitting on beefcake"" is as old as Aristophanes, but it's not really Austen, is it? The Darcy character is nicely played and Bret of ""Flight Of the Conchords"" is also very good, and I did enjoy the final rom-com ending. I could suspend my disbelief for that because that's what one does in rom-coms, but my disbelief in the ham-handed execution of the main plot points of the film was too great to be suspended. I would give this maybe 3 stars, but I wanted to warn true Austenites away.",1441843200,3,1178,4.723300970873787

5997032,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Loved the book, loved the movie even more. I read the book first, which usually means the film doesn't quite measure up. Not so with Austenland. It's sweet, funny, and breathlessly hilarious. Jennifer Coolidge *almost* steals the show, but Keri Russell's and JJ Field's romance is tender and compelling, and gives a fun, Austenian happy ending.",1441843200,,344,5.160714285714286

5997039,3,B00FKT9DYK,"This is a good, comedy movie for light watching.  Keri Russell plays a sweet, simple girl who has programmed her life to the tune of Jane Austen's novels.  She spends her total savings to attend a Jane Austen-oriented visit to an English manor house where women can dress up in period style clothing and pretend to be in Austen's novels.  Jane Seymour plays the brittle manager of the establishment.  Young male actors play various roles in the novels and they cater to the female guests.

So I enjoyed that aspect of the film, hence the 2 stars, recognizing those Jane Austen parallels, but overall the storyline was lame and predictable.  I don't mind Jennifer Coolidge (the blonde you see everywhere playing the ditz) and while it's not her fault, her character in this was ridiculous and stole away from what could have been a great premise for a screenplay.  Oh well, I had to see for myself.  Certainly not something I'd ever sit through again.",1441152000,,531,4.617021276595745

5997049,2,B00FKT9DYK,"This movie is so bad. I rented it because I've loved anything Keri Russell since Felicity; she's a great little actress and there just isn't enough of her in the entertainment world. I also love Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. There were several times I was just plain embarrassed for her and the silly lines/situations her character was put in, and whoever it was who played Mr. Nobley. There was clearly no chemistry between them, and there wasn't much depth at all to their ""love story"". Oh and I guess we weren't supposed to notice that the stable guy is actually Australian, not British. Jennifer Coolidge is thrown in the mix to play the only character she ever plays in any movie she's in. So glad I only rented and did not buy. If you want to see Keri Russell in something good (besides Felicity), hop on over to Netflix and watch her in the movie Dark Skies.",1441152000,,896,4.537037037037037

5997055,4,B00FKT9DYK,"I can't believe how much I love this show. It keeps me laughing with how ridiculous it is. I do think the character of Martin is too ugly and coarse for her to be messing around with, especially when she's such a Austen-o-phile. And I find myself fast forwarding through the parts with him and Jane together. What can I say: he bores me. If I wanted to watch a smutty looser hit on a girl he obviously isn't interested in, then I'd get some B-rated film to put me to sleep.

Yet, the rest of the film is wonderful! The rest of the actors really do a great job and make the movie very enjoyable. Also, I prefer this version to the actual book, when it comes to Henry Nobley's character. This version of him works better.
Overall I adore the film and think it makes all Jane Austen fans laugh at themselves in a good way.",1440892800,,819,4.1835443037974684

I didn't quite buy Keri Russell as the Austen addict that would be willing to blow her life savings on a fictional ""experience."" She seemed too normal to me - and too mature to be that naive. But I have to admit, as I watched it, the movie grew on me. The whole idea that actors were being paid to make sure every customer experiences romance was pretty intriguing. The lines became blurred. It was hard to tell what was real - and what was fake. Both Martin and Mr. Nobly seemed to have feelings for Keri's character Jane. But was one of them just acting - or were both of them? There was a bit of lewdness - which really showed the contrast between Jane Austen's world of refinement and manners and our world today. But the ending was satisfying - and I have to admit I enjoyed the movie more than I expected to.",1439683200,,883,4.261904761904762

5997114,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I love Jane Austen, but even friends of mine who don't know her works love this movie!  Of course, us Austen fanatics find this story about one of us hilarious. Jennifer Coolidge plays a rather low-brow, rich girl who is all about the men; her performance is a bit slapstick for some, but I think she is fabulous.  JJ Feild as the Darcy-esqe Mr. Nobly is adorable!  Keri Russel is perfect as the wallflower main character who finds her voice and her mojo. All the supporting actors are wonderfully funny, as well (including Jane Seymour as a rather stiff, disapproving matron--an essential Austen character).  I laughed a lot and melted along with ""Jane Erstwhile"" as her suitors wood her. But even my husband liked this movie, and he's not a fan of the ""chick flick.""",1438214400,,768,4.666666666666667

I found this to be well done.  Well scripted. It started out quirky and maintained the humor throughout. I smiled a lot.  Laughed a little.  Maybe wished I were her a TEENY (ok, maybe a little more than that), bit. The ending was a bit jolting, but I'm still smiling so it couldn't be that bad.

I highly recommend this for Austen fans out there.  Make sure you've read (and/or seen) them all as Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility all make appearances. And a note to all of us, be careful for what or whom you wish (although if you know a Mr. Knightly out there, I'm still single....).",1437523200,,786,4.454545454545454

It's the little things about this movie that keeps me watching it over and over again. Staples of Austen fiction like mixed up lovers, witty conversation, and play acting are reinterpreted to comedic effect by the scriptwriters and the hilarious cast. Jennifer Coolidge's Elizabeth Charming spouts of ridiculous non sequiturs left and right while the honored Miss Heartwright cracked me up with her eccentric mannerisms and line delivery. The male characters are almost as funny between the flamboyant Colonel Andrews and the exasperated Darcy-clone Henry Nobley who's frustration with the madness of the plot just made me like him more and more.

Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time and I really enjoyed the idea that this person obsessed with the story gets the chance to experience life in that world becoming both enchanted and disenchanted at the same time. No matter what era you live in life and love can be challenging in many ways and Jane gets to experience it first hand.

5997174,5,B00FKT9DYK,"A hilarious pantomime!
Before watching: Don't expect a film like Lost in Austen, where the heroine is literally transported into the P&P novel, or even a true remake of a modern P&P/Austen novel. Keep in mind, this film is very tongue-in-cheek and over the top ridiculous for a reason!

The reason? Consider your Austen dream (to experience Mr. Darcy) came true in our reality, what would that experience be like? How well can modern people replicate the charm of the past and how well would you behave in that bubble? This film pretty much paints the reality of when our 'dreams' come true in the most hilarious ways. In Austenland, Jane tries to experience her fairy-tale through actors [woah, Actors playing bad actors = mind blown ;) ] and things become a blur of what is real and what isn't. In the most contrived environment possible (which is intended), Jane, Jane's hero, and their growing attraction to one another is what's real.

5997237,4,B00FKT9DYK,"I enjoyed this adaptation of Austenland, even though it was much sillier than the book. I debated between three and four stars, since your enjoyment of the movie will depend on your type of humor.

Personally, I thought the characters were hilarious. It seems like the movie increased their ridiculousness to make the parody more obvious. Martin carts around these horrible stuffed birds for the scenery. Miss Charming is too stupid for her own good. And Captain East can't keep his shirt on to save his life.

The movie has some significant differences from the book. Mr. Nobley isn't an actor, which changes the dynamic of his and Jane's relationship. Jane and her best friend have a bet about her trip ending her obsession with Mr. Darcy. And the girls go ""hunting"" with stuffed partridges for some reason.

If you'd like a laugh, Austenland should do the trick! Just don't expect anything serious.",1426896000,,901,4.875816993464053

5997246,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I am going to be real about this. I have not read the book (though I plan on doing so)
Thus, I will judge this by the film contents. I warn you now, SPOILER ALERT!

Reading other reviews, you either love it, or hate this film. This is what I would like to call a Pride and Prejudice parody.
As a parody, you cannot take it that seriously.

However, that does not mean that there is no moral value in it.

We have Jane Hayes, who some think a obsessed, but I think that what is what it means to have a fandom, you love therefore obsess. You judge the people around you like you would there ones in a book.

She is, what I think to be a combination of the average Jane Austen heroine. Waiting like Anne Elliott (Persuasion), in want of something real like Marrianne Dashwood (Sense and Sensibility), easily contented like Catherine Morland(Northanger Abbey), and her Prejudice like Elizabeth Bennett (Pride and Prejudice).

Then there is Martin aka Stable Hand/Servant. He is like a modern day Wickham.

Henry Nobly is obviously a modern day Darcy, showing hints of the  character Henry Tilney at times, as well as a bit of Colonel Brandon in him.

Mrs Elizabeth Charming, is just a toned down Jennifer Coolidge with a bit of Mrs Jennings in her.

Colonel Andrews who I think is supposed to be doing.... actually I'm not sure what he is supposed to be doing, but he is very much like a modern day John Middleton in the Colonel's clothes with a stereotypical olde time mustache.

Lady Amelia Heartwright is a bit like a toned down Mrs Bingley, and at times like a Lucy Steele

Captain George East is nothing like the Captain Wentworth that I think he is supposed to betray, but is more like a captain Kirk wooing all the ladies with a jamiacan accent and yes, somehow losing his shirt at the first chance he gets and over acts to top it off.

The rest I'm too lazy to describe.

The story:

Did it feel rushed? Not really. It starts with the infomercial of Austenland, cutting back and forth through the short scenes of Jane going through the years and the effect of her obsession. She's in her thirties, looking for her Mr Darcy, and you can see that she's tired of failed relationships and failed life. Thinking a break is what she needs, what could be better then an Jane Austen themed Vacation Aka Real Life Role Playing Aka Choose Your Own Jane Austen Romance for three weeks. Spending her life savings, I would guess to be in the thousands, and for the cheapest Darcy Route, she sets off to Her home away from home. As she waits for the car to Austenland, she meets Lady Charming (Don't know of they ever she her real name) who is not really a fan of Jane Austen but I guess more of the English experience and she is as Stereotypical as a rich middle aged woman who is American as it can get.

Skipping on to when she meets the guys, she meets Andrews, just as hilarious as John Middleton.

Then there is Nobley, who is as Darcy and you can get, but is also like Mr Palmer now that I think about it.

The Romance? It is well played out, only cheesy at the end but in a good way, and keeps you on your toes. Who do you root for? I'll leave it to you. Martin can charm you but it's Nobley whose there when it counts. At one time it seems as though all the guys want Jane. I must admit, if you like reverse Harems, this is for you. Jj fields will win your heart I assure you, and make you wonder is he's Loki's brother. Eat your heart out girls, this is full of fan service.

The action? Well, there are the sissy guy fights. The almost assaulted Jane who is apparently part ninja (Abuse is not funny, but ninjas are)

The Pg 13 Rating? This is barely even. If it was not for Jennifer Coolidge and the shirt ripping George East, then I think this would have been Pg. There is no nudity, no sex, and I don't think I heard swearing. I think this is pretty tame and I prefer it that way.

Comedy? Milk shooting out of your nose funny. Nobley can't lie, he's too rudely honest, kind of reminds me of the sort of characters Alan Rickman plays. When he's not stepping on you, punching you, or complaining, he really is just in love with you. I think he was actually the funniest. We cannot forget George East, who is another captain Kirk when it comes to wooing the ladies and losing his shirt somehow. Then there is Jane's piano playing (Not Regency appropriate and I won't tell you what it is)
Coolidge, may I say more?

Drama? This is as romcon as it gets but there is a sort if sadness to it. I think, a part of her did not want to grow up. She is like the rest of us who go through a life changing experience and realize we were living in our day dreams this whole time and did not even know how cruel reality really is. Just like many others of Austen heroines, she's grows through the slap of disillusion, I must admit, it made me cry.

Conclusion?

This is a film for both Janites and Non Janites. It will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more, and make you yell out loud at how awesome it is. It's about growing up, it's about learning what you want, is about that true straightforward chaste love really exists, and most of all, it reminds you of why you love Mr Darcy so much and why he is truly our fantasy.",1426291200,,5212,4.253036437246964

I have to think that this sounded better in the creator's head as it just didn't come across as entertaining. They peppered it with pop songs from the 80s and 90s. The buxom blond woman from ""Legally Blond"" or whatever wasn't even funny. They wasted her talent.

5997270,2,B00FKT9DYK,"When I explained the premise of this movie with my roommate, he refused to watch it with me.  After the first ten minutes of the show I was fairly sure he'd had the right idea-those ten minutes were horrible.  I'm not typically someone to complain about a movie not being like the book (I can generally keep them pretty separate) but in this case they changed the basis of her character and I didn't like it one bit.  Instead of being the slightly bitter single female she had been in the book, she became this desperate woman who had a teenage like obsession with all things Jane Austen.  It was kind of disgusting how they made her so weak in the movie-and I almost didn't finish it.

However, I wanted to write this review, so after a week of putting it off I opened the film back up and finished it.  Luckily, it got better than those first few moments indicated and I actually enjoyed a few parts.  I feel like the ending was a bit more believable in the movie than the book, but overall it was too cheesy and the characters were unbelievably portrayed and I'll probably never watch it again.

5997317,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I can't say enough about how perfect this movie was, in its casting, its script, its tongue-in-cheek acting and its light-hearted humor. In our liberated and egalitarian age where women are more devalued, dehumanized and unhappy than ever before, the pathological obsession with the fiction of Jane Austen- and with ""Pride and Prejudice"" in particular- is a phenomenon that holds rich promise for study and satire. This movie doesn't quite go that deep, although its conceit centers around a money-making concern that capitalizes on the Regency fantasies of women so obsessed. The Jane Austen theme is just the foundation upon which to construct a very funny romantic comedy about modern romantic disillusionment and popular escapist fantasies.",1420416000,,744,5.422413793103448

It is not deep or thought provoking at all but is completely entertaining and enjoyable.  Some parts are a bit ridiculous and overdone but to me this makes the movie fun and whimsical.  Understandably this movie is not for everyone but if you are interested in it enough to be reading reviews then give it a shot.  You won't regret it.,1418515200,,483,4.393258426966292
5997345,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I bought this only because I enjoyed listening to the music in the movie and the director effectively using portions of the movie as a sort of music video.  The story itself is Austen-esque lite.  But, there are moments that might make you chuckle except maybe the near-eye-gouging scene.  Some may find that bit funny, but I cringed in horror at the very unfunny potential consequences of accident.  Jane Seymour's tremendous talent was wasted on this fluff and some viewers might find the main heroine played by Keri Russell a bit annoying at the beginning.  But, in the end, the heroine redeems herself.  Stay tuned for the cute bits in the end credits.",1418342400,,656,4.761061946902655

I viewed the movie after not getting enough of the book.  Read it cover-to-cover in one sitting.  The actors and actresses chosen are adorable, Miss Charming is soooo charming (I love that actress).  It left me wanting more.  Come on Ms. Shannon, give us more!  :-)

As one who enjoys fun movies, this fit the bill.  I did not watch it with ""expectations"" as in thinking or hoping it would be like the book or not.  I simply enjoyed it because of the theme (Regency) and everything else was icing on top in my opinion.  Someone reviewed and said something to the effect of ""if you lighten up"", chill out and just enjoy the movie you won't be disappointed.  It is a feel good movie.

It was much like a train wreck; so chaotic and filled with disorganized senselessness that your mind screams at you to just look away..yet hard to look away from. I swear I watched this whole movie just waiting for the one point where it started to make some sort of logical sense.
The story line is just painful. Frankly, I would have to pray that if I ever lost my marbles and became obsessed with a romance novelist to such a degree that I created a sort of shrine to her works in my home....at least one of my friends would come to aid and haul me off to the intensive therapy I so desperately needed. Oddly, in this story, nobody did that for the main character.
The cast could not have been more obnoxious, and they did not play well off of each other, making the story even harder to watch. The overall effect made Hanna Montana films seem infinitely deeper than this one.

I was not really excited to see another Austen related movie, but went with her since she was SO excited.  In fact after I got there I was the only male in the theater.

After watching the movie I quite enjoyed it; more so than I was expecting.  There are some laugh out loud moments and though some of it was a bit silly, it was something that I appreciated.  I was never bored by this movie and since I had never read the book I didn't know how it would end.

5997398,3,B00FKT9DYK,I thought it was a four star movie except for the very obvious pregnancy of Keri Russell (until the last scene which was either filmed earlier or after the birth of her child).

This watches like a film by someone who has marveled at the Austen/romcom phenomenon, but never actually fell in love with her novels (or spent anytime engaging with British culture of any century). It's a vision completely uninformed of what it purports to be spoofing. It's tarty and ridiculous, but ultimately joyless. (The actors certainly don't seem like they are enjoying themselves!) If you like stupid comedies, I suppose this is just as bad at the rest. If you are a fan of Jane Austen and like your films smart or at least entertaining, skip this one.

Her acting was as usual unbelievable and overdone, which left Keri Russell no where to go when playing against her. Mrs. Coolidge should stick to characters on the Disney Channel and children's movies were she is much better suited. After 15 minutes it became a children's movie, silly, overacted and extremely predictable. This could and should have been a wonderful movies for Austin fans as well as an introduction for those unfamiliar with her work.

5997439,4,B00FKT9DYK,"There are dozens of different types of comedies out there: dark comedy, gross-out humor, parodies, sitcoms, romantic comedy, and each one can appeal to vastly different people. ""Austenland"" decides to play it safe by appealing to as many types of comedy as possible, resulting in a rather uneven film, but one that will probably get a few chuckles out of any audience member.

Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is a thirty-something woman obsessed with Jane Austen, who leaps at the chance to visit Austenland, a Regency Era themed resort where guests can immerse themselves in beautiful gardens, a gorgeous manner house, authentic period clothes, and a range of actors committed to making their stay as magical as possible. (One can't help but wonder what the real Jane Austen would have thought of this).

Things aren't quite as perfect as Jane had hoped, for not only has she purchased the cheapest package, which puts her in dowdy clothes and a tiny room, but some of the other inhabitants of the house are rather difficult to get along with. The manager Mrs Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour) seems to have it in for her, and her nephew Henry Nobly (JJ Feild) is a classic Mr Darcy snob. There's Miss Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy and brash American who has no idea what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice/dp/0486284735/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice</a>&nbsp;is, and Lady Amelia Heartwright (Georgia King) whose sweet exterior hides a conniving heart.

Still, Jane is determined to enjoy herself, and soon strikes up a friendship/romance with the stable boy Martin (Bret McKenzie). But in a place where everyone is playacting to some degree, there's plenty of confusion over who's sincere and who's not.

Though Keri Russell is suitably sweet and lovely, the highlight for me was Jennifer Coolidge as Elizabeth Charming, a rather ditzy woman who's only there to wear the frocks and meet a man. Utterly clueless as to the world she's meant to be inhabiting, she speaks with a pronounced cockney accent and asks questions like: ""is this the Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang car?"" Determined not to be outdone is James Callis as the foppish Colonel Andrews and Georgia King as a winsome young woman whose voracious lust for a visiting captain can't be contained. The three of them together manage to generate the most laughs.

There are two major weaknesses to the story, the first being that Jane is hardly a well-developed character. That she's unlucky in love and that she loves Jane Austen is literally the only two things we know about her, but even these traits are rather glossed over. We never actually learn WHY she loves Jane Austen so much - is it the writing? The romance? The wit? The characters? The lack of understanding means that Jane remains a sweet but bland character, and I felt no real investment in the resolution of her love triangle (and the fact that one of the men she's interested in turns out to be a cad feels like cheating - up until that point, I actually preferred *him* as Jane's love interest).

It also would have been nice to actually explore the concept of Austenland a bit more. If I was in a place like that, I'd be interested in the history of the house, in learning how to do things as they were done in the 18th century, in cross-checking aspects of Austen's books with the world around me - but the film glosses over all this as well, simply using it as the (admittedly very beautiful) backdrop for romantic comedy shenanigans.

But ""Austenland"" is mostly concerned with making you laugh. The over-the-top characters and the rather absurd scenario are sustained for the duration of the film's run-time, and the broadness of the comedy means that even men (yes, I made a couple of men sit through it) will find it amusing.",1409788800,,3839,4.9890625

5997441,2,B00FKT9DYK,"I'll start right out by saying that I'm a guy, and as such, the whole Jane Austen Mystique totally eludes me. The trailer, however, made the film look promising and so I dared a rental. What we end up with is a movie that can't quite decide what it wants to be-a quirky comedy or a quirky drama/comedy, or... Who knows what? I think if they had played it  straight as a light comedy,  with some touches of drama, it would've worked better. What we get instead is a film the jumps all over the place. ***SPOILERS*** For you Romantics out there (and you know who you are!), how can we take Keri Russell's character's hopes and dreams seriously, when she's surrounded by slightly cracked to straight out wackos in a bizarre pseudo ""Austinique immersion experience"" that is not believable? When you watch a movie like this, you have to have a certain amount of ""suspension of disbelief"", to make the characters actions in the story make sense. A lot of what the characters do just doesn't have any logic, at all. I certainly didn't believe the ""happy ending"".The characters, as presented, just weren't very interesting. A much better Keri Russell movie to check out is WAITRESS. Anyway, I overanalyzed this film and I suppose that I don't have any validation as a film critic, in this situation, beings that I'm not  an Austin fan. One last thing: there is one aspect of the film that I enjoyed, and it was the performance by James Callis as ""Col. Andrews"" - It was hilarious. One other thing: when I originally heard of this film, before seeing the trailer, I was thinking it might of been a science-fiction film along the lines of WESTWORLD. Just imagine all the handsome young ""Mr. Darcy's"" and the members of the staff, turning out to be androids, which end up malfunctioning and killing off the guests!

The story is most definitely chick-lit, but it's a fun one for the Jane Austen loving women of the world and the movie is a pretty good adaptation of the book.

5997505,2,B00FKT9DYK,"Plot

Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is a Jane Austen nut who is in love with Mr. Darcy, the romantic male lead in Jane Austens Pride & Prejudice. She is intimately familiar with this story, for she has read it countless times and has continuously viewed the mini-series with Colin Firth and even has a life sized cardboard cutout of him as Mr. Darcy in her apartment. She believes the next logical step for her is to go to Austenland in England. Once there she becomes familiar with the males actors that she is supposed to form a relationship with, including the actor who is acting a lot like the fictitious Mr. Darcy, but she finds herself sneaking around with the guy who works in the stables. Now she is torn between sticking to the script and being engrossed by her fantasies or should she venture out and break away with this real relationship.

Character Development

The growth that the protagonist goes through is fairly predictable because she is such a Jane Austen fanatic you knew something was about to change, yet the change was more or less symbolic and did anything but dazzle me.

Acting

Keri Russell does a fine job for the most part. This role didn't really showcase her talents, because I have seen a better performance out of her in the feature length cartoon Wonder Woman (2009). As Jane Hayes she didn't have much to say or a great deal to react to. Most of who she encountered were these broad stroke characters that are less lifelike than the ones out of you would find in the average comic book. They were loud and literally get in her face. Jennifer Coolidge played one of these vacuous characters. I don't know if she is supposed to be funny because she is so hopelessly annoying, but for me she was just plain annoying and oh so boring.

Overview

Not as enjoyable as I thought it would be with Keri Russell at the helm. I fault the writing more than anything else. The pace was just too slow and the other actors didn't really do an acceptable job supporting Russell who went along admirably. I thought that there would be more of a connection to Jane Austens books which makes me question if the creators spent much time reading them in the first place. There was just so much material that could have been used and it is a shame it didn't make its way to the screen. The exchange between the characters played more for cheap laughs than anything else. I was hoping for the types of conversations right out of Pride & Prejudice and instead of that there is one guy taking off his shirt and an incredible awful play production that one of the characters wrote. It really felt like amateur hour. Yet there was one nice turn in the end that surprised me and made me think that the writing didn't fall asleep completely at the wheel. But by this time I was so underwhelmed that it almost didn't matter.",1406419200,,2827,4.488326848249027
5997506,3,B00FKT9DYK,"I felt kind of let-down by the book, and was hoping that the movie adaptation would twist it just enough to meet my expectations (the movie of The Jane Austen Book Club achieved this for me -- I was hoping for a similar result). On paper, the story is genius -- I mean, a real-life Austen vacation? YES! But unfortunately, the movie does nothing to improve the book, and very possibly takes something away from it. I love Kerri Russell, but this part didn't do her justice. No one would believe that a natural beauty like Russell would be such an Austen maniac that she obsesses over it 24/7 and it interferes with her love life, and the men she does date are unimpressive. She is sadly two-dimensional as Jane. I don't blame her, but think the material didn't give her enough room to flesh out her character. The other key players are extremely over-the-top, and the love interest seems to come out of nowhere; they weren't given much time to build any chemistry.

This is the kind of movie that I would probably watch again if it was on TV and wanted background noise while I did something else, but it's not one I'd recommend or seek out. It did actually make me want to re-read the book and see if a second chance was due, but I haven't decided whether it's worth my time.",1406419200,,1276,4.406779661016949

5997511,4,B00FKT9DYK,"I really liked this movie. It is not a movie that takes itself too seriously but it still manages to not become completely without substance.  This is not a movie for someone who is actually looking for a straight-up romance.  This is about the Austen fantasy not living up to reality and how difficult it can be to keep reality and fantasy separate.

The characters are more characatures than people and the movie is very silly at times.  Personally, I liked that, but your sense of humor may be different so be aware that that is what you are getting.  I liked the book much better.  The characters were more ""real"" but I don't think it would have translated well to a movie without the amping up of the humor.",1406160000,,712,4.438461538461539

5997518,4,B00FKT9DYK,"It was a while ago that I watched this> I hadn't figured out how to review movies yet. But I remember it was a lighthearted, love story, with an unusual twist.

This woman who LOVES Jane Austin, and has littered her life with everything Jane...including her hope to find a mate similar to a Jane Austin hero; has been begged by her friends to abandon this obsession as she is not able to live her life, while she clings to her fantasy.

BUT the young woman finds an advertisement for an ""Austin World"" in England, where the woman runs an estate as if it were back in Jane Austins time, along with hired actors to help the guests feel like they are there.  The more you pay, the higher class you are, and the heroine doesn't have a lot of money...so she is not very valued in the scenario....or by the hostess. (which makes her more like the REAL Jane Austin heroine). It goes from there, and does a better job of it than I originally thought it would.

She tells her friends that IF she can not finally find what she is looking for at Austin World, she will throw out all her Jane stuff and get on with her life.

It had no deep meanings, or great acting, or gorgeous film artistry...but it was a relaxing fun time, and that is why I gave it a 4 stars because I had a good time.",1405814400,2,1278,4.178861788617886

This ham-handed attempt at contemporary spin for a story of a modern woman in Austen's world is so obnoxious and annoying that I found myself muting and fast-forwarding through whole scenes of the film. It's too bad; the same idea in other hands, with a better screenplay could have been an enjoyable movie.",1402704000,2,584,4.84
5997570,5,B00FKT9DYK,"So the movie is based on the book of the same name by Shannon Hale, which I haven't read as I didn't realize that was the case when I came across the movie. But I want to give credit to the book for being a relatively original concept, which you don't see a lot of these days. So I can't say how true the movie is to the book, but the movie is a sweet, clever story of modern day people living in an Austen-era fantasy resort. Yes, it's still essentially a rom-com, but there's something about all those accents that just makes it feel a little more sophisticated. As an American I am sorry to say I was only familiar with Keri Russell, Jennifer Coolidge, and Jane Seymour as actors prior to watching this, but I am happy to say this movie introduced me to JJ Feild, Bret McKenzie, Georgia King, James Callis, and Ricky Whittle all who bring something unique to their characters and prompted me to research their other work. It's nice too that while there is ultimately a predictable ending, the audience isn't sure at first who to ""root"" for and the main character does have moments of self-actualization throughout the movie. Also it's fun to re-watch for costume and set design features that are just crazy ridiculous (in a good way) at times.",1402617600,,1246,4.469298245614035

I started watching it and without me actually seeing the ending coming, there it was.  And there is a 'bonus' at the end.

This movie's ending really surprised me but also worked really, really well. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who enjoy romantic comedies because it has all of the elements of a fun rom-com, but it's also really unique and surprising.",1401062400,,659,4.739130434782608

One of the best things about this movie is that it co-stars the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge.

5997597,3,B00FKT9DYK,"Keri Russel, JJ Feild, Jennifer Coolidge, Bret McKenzie, and Jane Seymour star in the mildly (and I mean mildly) entertaining movie about an obsessed Jane Austen fan who sets off to England for a dream vacation. Her dream, of course, is to be transported back into time by living in an English manor house, filled with Regency era characters, costumes, and lifestyles.  Unable to find her perfect Mr. Darcy in life, she hopes to at least find him in a short, fantasy-filled vacation.

Unlike the series Lost in Austen, she acclimates fairly well to her surroundings.  Of course, everyone is really in the 21st century, though they are encouraged to live in the early 19th century.  The ladies pay to stay in a house full of actors from the footmen to the other guests, in the hopes that at their last night they have received a proposal of marriage from one of the cast.

Jennifer Coolidge, as usual, plays a rather ditzy blonde.  JJ Feild is the resident snobbish Darcy-type.  Bret McKenzie is the servant help, though he comes across as just another modern employee taking care of the horses and landscape. Keri Russell, who plays Jane (of course) Hayes, is the modern woman looking to fulfill her Austen fantasies.

Even though Jane arrives filled with anticipation, she seems to teeter between reality and fantasy. She has purchased the ""cheap"" package and is relegated to the servant quarters for her room upon arrival. The other guests are lodging in the opulent surroundings. During her stay she becomes attached to what she thinks is the real-life help, rather than being attracted to the snobbish Darcy-type actor.  As the story plays out, each character falls for someone either in their fantasy world or in reality.  However, I won't tell you who is who.

The movie is mildly entertaining and not as good as Lost in Austen.  Probably the best part is when the man she eventually falls in love with declares his feelings. When she balks they are still living a fantasy, he says in his dreamy English accent, ""But Jane, don't you understand. You are my fantasy.""  (Or something along those lines.)  Then the romantic kiss.",1400457600,,2131,4.802739726027397

It started out with some potential but by halfway through was completely asinine that I was just appalled. There were moments when there was music and nice touches that made me almost hope it could work. I had read the reviews but most of those were good. Hmmm, not sure how that happened??? Save your time and money. Reread the books or check out the Masterpiece versions.",1400457600,,458,4.4
5997599,2,B00FKT9DYK,"Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is a 30-something unmarried woman, presumably holding out for a real Mr. Darcy given her unhealthy obsession with Jane Austen and her ""Pride and Prejudice"" novel in particular.  Seizing on an opportunity to travel to England and spend a week at Austenland, off she goes.  Jane who is on a limited budget opts for the ""bronze"" or was it ""copper"" package, which is the lowest price option.

Austenland is acres of 19th century countryside splendor with a large mansion, stables and all the accoutrements of the bygone era.  Mrs. Watt (Jane Seymour) is in charge of the place.  She hires the staff, including the actors who ""attend"" to the guests.  Nothing overtly sexual of course.  In fact guests and staff are not to touch each other except in appropriate ways, such as dancing or help out of a carriage.  Stephanie Meyer (""Twilight"") gets her first producing opportunity and Jerusha Hess directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with Shannon Hale.  And well, it's all terrible.

Billed as a romantic comedy, the movie isn't funny or romantic.  Jennifer Coolidge plays Elizabeth Charming, one of the 3 guests (Georgia King as Lady Amelia is the other), tries to inject some humor into the events but alas she has nothing to work with.  With Jane's bottom of the barrel package she's given dowdy clothes to wear, as if she is one of the servants.  Still, she begins to draw attention from the actors especially the one playing a Darcy-like character (JJ Field).  Jane, often shunned, thanks to Mrs. Watt's obvious displeasure of not going for the ""gold"" package, sneaks off on her own and strikes up a flirtation with Martin (Bret McKenzie), the stable master.  So we have to guess what's real and what is just acting.  And is Jane playing along or getting played.  I'm not sure why I was drawn to this mess.  I guess the idea of Keri Russell playing a character so different from her nasty Russian spy on ""The Americans"" had me interested.  A mistake.

Now the Blu ray disc I watched is not a mistake.  In fact, the picture is gorgeous.  It comes in a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are vibrant, flush with greens, blues and browns, the look is authentic (excellent sets).  Detail is excellent.  I could find nothing wrong with the picture.  The audio is equally as good.  A strong DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is the way to go.  Clarity is very good, surrounds have a natural variety and the sound is solid from beginning to end.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai and Mandarin.  Extras include a commentary track with Meyer and Hess along with a Q & A session with some of the actors, a trailer and some previews.",1400457600,,2724,4.73404255319149

It could have used a little longer to develop the romance, but it's still a new favorite of mine.
However, I only rated it a 3 because of the bluray.  There is nothing special about the bluray. No extras that the DVD doesn't have, no digital copy or anything. I wish I just would have gotten the DVD.",1400457600,,572,4.107142857142857

My mom and I went and saw it in theatre's 3 times just so we could get our fix before it came out on DVD. Some people might call it ridiculous and they would be right, but it's also hilarious if you have ever obsessed over Austen, you will get the smaller jokes as well as the way over the top antics which made this movie so fun and makes it possible to watch again and again. Which now my mom and I do. I still catch little things I missed the first 5 times. That's good stuff. And if you don't know who J.J. Field is please go educate yourself. Oh, and it should go without saying that you should read some the the Lady as well.

Who also hasn't thought about a trip to England just to tour Jane Austen's descriptive details of cities and scenery.  I really liked Kerry Russel's performance in the movie but found the other female lead a bit annoying and lacking.  Having said that, I still enjoyed the movie very much.  I particularly liked the conflict that occurs between people searching for the beauty of true love versus a modern day hookup.  It reveals that Jane Austen knew far more about love than most people even begin to understand today.

The movie is not academy award winning material but the subject is entertaining and fun.  It will go on my shelf next to my other Jane Austen favorite classics.",1399075200,,795,4.635714285714286
5997631,5,B00FKT9DYK,i watched it 3 times. It was another a fun film with Keri Russell. I loved her in Waitress and this film was even better. The characters were great. You know that a movie about a 30-something woman whose obsession with all things Austen spends her life savings to go to an Austen theme vacation it is going to be silly and fairly predictable. Jane Seymour is a great antagonist. You just want to slap her every time she speaks to Jane (yes her name is actually Jane). Jennifer Coolidge plays her usually crazy lovable character you can count on be an ally. There are some great moments like when she is leaving at the airport. Don't expect a Jane Austen novel when you watch it. It's just plan 21st century satire of Austen. Have fun.,1399075200,,734,4.404411764705882
5997632,1,B00FKT9DYK,Obviously it is a spoof but it is entirely over done. Jennifer Coolidge was too much for me to bare. I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes or so. I think I expected something other than a plot driven toward sex. Oh well.,1399075200,2,226,3.9347826086956523
5997633,4,B00FKT9DYK,Cute concept- Jane Austen theme park. Protagonist was likable and involved in humorous situations. It was a good romantic comedy- if you like rom-coms.,1398988800,,151,5.333333333333333
5997634,4,B00FKT9DYK,"I was not one of the many who had read the book prior to seeing the movie. I, in fact, had no idea what the movie was even about, so it had no expectations to live up to. I did, however, enjoy it. I am a fan of Austen's work, and enjoyed that, although it was based on a character visiting an Austen-type ""theme park"", it was completely based in today's world and its interpretation of Austen's time. I think that worked well given that the main character's ideal of a true ""Austen experience"" was never truly to be realized. Yes, she (spoiler alert) got her Mr Darcy in the end, but he was the modern equivalent of it, which was just right for her. Perhaps it was a little predictable and had some silly gags and actors, but I still found it charming. I didn't watch it looking for depth or for a Jane Austen equivalent in storytelling. I watched it purely to be entertained, and I was. It provided just the right amount of escapism to be enjoyable for me.

As for the DVD(s) I purchased here, it was (they were) unfortunately defective. Twice. Part of the video blacked out on the screen while the audio continued to play. Both discs in exactly the same place. Not sure if I should try for a third time (perhaps Amazon got a defective batch of DVDs?) or just purchase it from somewhere else, because, even though it did not follow the book all that well (yes, I have since read it), I still enjoy it and will be adding it to my collection.",1398902400,,1441,4.278388278388278

Each element--locations, props, sets, and costumes are thought out and complete in their sumptuous playful simplicity--the whole film is like sipping Mimosas on a sunny afternoon with nothing to do but read, laugh and dream...For anyone who has no clue what bliss a day like that can bring, forget it, you'll never get the brilliance that is this movie.

But sadly, this was too over the top.  Did not work.  Too weird.  Why is Jane Seymour holding a fake lamb? Very annoyed with the whole ""copper package"" schtick.  Why would Wattlesbrook be so incessantly mean to a paying guest? Would they really put a maid in the carriage and a guest in the back like luggage? Hated all the raunchy jokes. Really?  A woman who truly loves Austen would visit a place like Austenland to look at the crotches of the servants? Aren't we dreaming of the witty, romantic dialogue? And what can I say about a sexy, African-British pirate who keeps tearing off his shirt in a Jane Austen world?  So weird. Frankly, it's insulting to be equated with fans of Fabio or Harlequin Romances. It might have worked if just a couple of characters had been over the top (like Miss Charming and Mr. Wattlesbrook) but everyone was over the top and it flopped.  The book was OK.  Hoped the movie would improve it, not make it worse.  I will say this though.  After watching it the first time, cringing and hating it, I watched it again and found more things to laugh at in a weird Napoleon Dynamite way. The ending at the airport was funny.  So, I gave it another star and I'll probably watch it again with my sisters for a quirky, Napoleon Dynamite type experience.

Mr. Nobley and Elizabeth Charming (two characters in the movie) easily steal the limelight but not the thunder from Keri Russel's character, Jane, the main protagonist.

She buys the ""budget"" package which gets her a room in the servants wing,  exclusion from the fancy carriage as well as some special events like private Whist lessons.  But no matter since the stable man, Martin,  is darn sexy.  Sounds like an entertaining premise, right?  Not. Not witty, not pretty, not visually gorgeous like so many English period movies, not well cast.
Kerry Russell has absolutely no sparkle and seems completely forced in all her ""acting"". Co-attendee, Jennifer Coolidge  is her busty, brash, vulgar self whose voice grates in every scene. (Coolidge is typecast: she plays this same role in many movies.) Jane Seymore as the snooty owner of Austenland is relegated to some barking and mincing with no evidence of her former star power and none of the scene stealing that Judi Dench or Maggie Smith carry off.

Jennifer Coolidge's character in this movie really drove home the ridiculousness of the whole Austenland experience.  Keri Russell made being loveless and pathetic cute.  And JJ Field did a marvelous job of being almost Darcy-like.  Ah....JJ Feild, with his stiff English exterior and soft, longing eyes, made falling in love with everything English easy-peasy!

There are bits of conversation and eye contact that seem insignificant initially but pay attention as they make the story more meaningful as the plot builds.

There are plenty of obvious inside jokes and references for Austen fans, who might also be amused by the Austenesque social commentary on hierarchies, money and the roles we all play. The casting is spot on, especially the supporting characters -- Jennifer Coolidge, Georgia King and James Callis are laugh-out-loud hilarious. The writing is worth noticing, too, since some of the silliest lines are almost tossed aside and easy to miss. True, it's not a deep, serious story. It's fluff.

Compared to something similar such as Jemima Rooper  (Lost in Austen) Ms. Russell was not at all satisfying enough to carry the film for me.  I thought Jennifer Coolidge's acting AND character terribly superfluous.  I became quite agitated when she appeared on screen and not in a good way in which an antagonistic character is supposed to make one feel agitated, afraid, etc.  I turned this off about 10 minutes in and that much I forced myself to watch hoping it would get better!",1395705600,,605,4.714285714285714

5997767,3,B00FKT9DYK,"If Jane Austen and her books are Ghirardelli, then this movie is like a Hershey kiss. Mostly satisfying but leaves you wanting more. The characters aren't too well developed but the plot is mostly well laid out and easy to follow. It's in no way a direct homage to Jane Austen or her sensibilities, but It's a funny fluff of a movie that's almost saccharine sweet and feel-goody. It'll make you laugh if you don't take yourself or your Jane Austen too seriously.

While I enjoyed the novel, I was a little too generally embarassed to derive much enjoyment from it...but the movie takes slight embarassment to the level of the absurd which creates a delightful series of laugh-out-loud moments.  The comedy does not detract from the love story...but rather adds to it. The cast is superb--Russell plays a great ""straight"" to the madness about her, Fields is sufficiently dreamy as a Darcy character. Great comedic performances by Bret Mackenzie, Jane Seymour, James Callis and Georgia King...but Jennifer Coolidge as Miss Charming steals the show.  Excellent movie, and a must-watch!",1395619200,,726,5.350877192982456

The movie looked dumb to me, but I needed a comedy, and I love Jane Austen, so I watched it. And I was pleasantly surprised. I love Jane Seymour and she does not disappoint as the English lady with an attitude. Keri Russell is a cute American with a Jane Austen obsession. Enough for the plot summary. I recommend this movie as a cheery pick-me-up for Jane Austen fans and their loved ones.",1395532800,,522,4.336734693877551
5997781,5,B00FKT9DYK,For the Austen-addict and the Austen-phobe alike. This movie does a delightful job of weaving a myriad of Regency allusions (mostly Austen) with satire about our more modern foibles. There is a delightful balance of tongue-in-cheek and sincerity of story throughout the movie. I think it gets funnier each time I watch it as I catch things the actors 'in the background' are doing. It is such a tightly constructed movie! Enjoy...again and again and again.,1395532800,,456,5.0131578947368425

They would sell out in hours! I highly recommend this to anyone who asks, and maybe to some who don't since I love it that much.",1395532800,,388,3.9240506329113924

I was actually hoping for bloopers or a deleted scene.  Watched the included interviews, which was just ""okay"".

5997792,4,B00FKT9DYK,"Jane (Keri Russell) is a Jane Austen junkie. She opts to spend her life savings to travel to England and go to Austenland where she will be immersed into the period with actors who guarantee love...or at least the false feeling of falling in love with an actor. She has the basic package and gets to be a servant girl orphan. Also on the trip is Miss Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) who has the deluxe package and plays an heiress. She knows nothing about Jane Austin and only crudely wants to meet a man.

Once there Jane falls for the stable help ( Bret McKenzie) while also being courted by Mr. Nobely (JJ Feild).

The film is formulaic chick flick down to the music montage to try on clothes. It is mildly Austen-like but never truly capturing the genius of Jane Austen. It is a film that can be enjoyed without being familiar with the works of Jane Austin (Just in case I took a Wiki crash course before viewing.)

A fun film.",1395360000,,938,4.410404624277457

I never read the book this movie is based on, but if it's half as funny as this movie, it must be hysterical. I can only imagine how much fun it must have been to be IN the movie. Everyone seems to genuinely having a great time, and it really comes through.

It may seem like a chick flick to some, but my husband found it hilarious as well. Jennifer Coolidge...what an underrated actor she is. And what is not to love about Keri Russell? Plus, ever since I saw Jane Seymour in Wedding Crashers, I've come to expect her zany brand of humor in everything she works in. This is no exception. I loved all the male leads, too. I can't decide which scene is funniest, but I'm rooting for the drawing room scene where Keri Russell plays the only song she knows on the piano, ""Hot in Here"" by Nelly. And do NOT miss watching the credits to see a really hilarious cast rendition of that song. I would pay the price of the disc just to see that.

Clearly, I loved this!",1395273600,,1081,4.1923076923076925

It will never win any awards, but it was well performed.  The house they used was lovely; as were the grounds.  Nice costumes.  You can point to who represents which Pride and Prejudice character and there are a few chuckles along the way.  'Lady Amelia Heartwright' was a hoot to watch just because of how she moves (you'll have to see it).  Was it a bit silly?  Yes.  But it was also the secret-don't thing about-not even my best friend knows, fantasy of Darcy fans...and made me smile, sigh, and laugh a bit at myself at the ending.",1395187200,,672,4.253968253968254

None of us have a lifesized cardboard Mr. Darcy, but we certainly would like to know where to get one like the movie version.  Two husbands and a fiance in our group cheered when Keri Russell's date punched ""Mr. Darcy"" in the face and we had a great discussion afterwards on FANDOM.

5997872,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I have seen just about every Jane Austen movie ever made (my mother is kind of obsessed).  Despite the fact that my mother is a purist when it comes to Jane Austen, she loved this movie.  She said that she felt it made fun of Jane Austen fans in a respectful way.  Then, we took my older brother who does not like Jane Austen to see this movie in theaters.  He said that it seemed awful for the first ten minutes or so, but then he loved the rest.
The truth is, if you are looking for substance, this is not your movie.  However, if you just want to watch something to make you laugh, this is great (especially if you have ever known anyone who has been obsessed with Jane Austen).  It's not very serious, but then it was clearly not made to be taken seriously.",1394496000,,761,4.142857142857143
5997873,4,B00FKT9DYK,"This movie does focus on ""Pride and prejudice"", but if you are a period drama aficionado ( guilty as charged !!! )  you will find it  hilarious as it parodies the production of all those mini series we adore so much.

Some critics have ripped this movie to shreds claiming it had huge potential for deep social satire and profound look into the nature of human beings and so on, a potential that was missed with the film being a mere romanic comedy . Perhaps, but when looking on this film as a romantic comedy, and not expecting it to be a ""life changing"" experience, you end up with a delightful, refreshing re-telling of pride and prejudice.
One might claim that Austen's writing is basically the 19 century romantic comedy - we have two people destined to be in love -they may not see it at first, all sorts of osbtacles may delay their happily ever after, but true love and wedding bells are waiting for them at the end of their novel. Is that so deep, insightful and life changing? No, And yet Austen is one of the most popular authors ever, and people still enjoy and appreciate her work. The beginning is a bit slow and awkward, but don't stop watching - it gets better.  And As far as romantic comedy goes there were a  few very surprising plot twists, which I TOTALLY DID NOT SEE COMING.( no spoilers )  Surprise is a sensation one seldom experiences when watching  rom com,  so I was doubly delighted and surprised to the extent that I needed to watch the film again.

Jane Hayes (  the Lovely Keri Russell )  is 30 something single woman, unlucky in love, mainly because she is obsessed with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy from ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Unsatisfied with modern romance, Jane spends her entire savings on a ""life changing"" vacation at an Austen themed resort, complete with the  English Manor house setting,  regency era costumes and manners, and ,of course, trained  actors to play the gentleman for every guest's Austen's fantasy. Jane arrives to Austenland, brimming with excitement, but quickly discovers that the authenticity of her Austen experience is somewhat over what she would have liked - due to the fact that she could afford only the basic package and other guests have paid much more for the deluxe one, she is treated in a snobbish way by the resort proprietor, presented as a poor orphan with no prospects, and is given a rather drab wardrobe while the others wear fabulous gowns.

And Thus - our story begins: we have the poor, yet beautiful and worthy heroine, strolling along beautiful English gardens. We're just missing our Mr. Darcy - This is when the fun begins and we're introduced to the resort's staff and guests, bad actors with outrageously fake upper class manners and accents, pretending to be part of fantasy world of proper ladies and gallant gentleman. I found that part to be so amusing, how they parody OTHER ACTORS in those type of productions. Most Notable is  the dashing Mr. Nobley's ( JJ Field ) over the top boredom and disgust with the human race as he totally ripped off Firth's iconic performance. Bravo :)  A very clever use of Modern soundtrack accentuate the absurd clash between our ordinary world and the pompousness of the fantasy world. Keep watching the closing titles for a last bit of comedy :)",1394496000,,3268,4.653913043478261
5997874,1,B00FKT9DYK,Women making hideous movies for who?!  I love Keri Russell.  What did they have to do to her to get her to submit herself to this humiliation!!

5997878,4,B00FKT9DYK,"For the record, I loathed the book Austenland.  It was smarmy, Jane was shallow and dull, and the author not only had no concept of the reality of people interested in living history, but actively looked down her nose at them.  The same kind of contempt was shown for Austen fans.

That said, I liked the concept, and I love both Jane Seymour and Keri Russell.  I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did.  While this is never going to be a movie I watch over and over, it was funny.  I found myself laughing, and I really enjoyed the performances of Russell, Seymour, Feild, and some of the others.  Jennifer Coolidge was, as she always is, completely over the top ridiculous and really detracted from the movie, but for a few moments when she was allowed to actually act rather than act the buffoon.

The story had slightly more depth thanks to the interactions between the actors that gave nuance to a completely flat script.  The ending felt far more charming (and the airport scene much funnier) than the book version (and how often can you say that?), if you ignored the tag at the end with the ""Miss Charming"" version of Austenland.  All in all, worth watching if you want to fritter away a couple hours.",1394409600,3,1215,4.4324324324324325

5997881,2,B00FKT9DYK,"The movie spends too much time on matters that , ultimately, proved to be tangential. The chemistry between the actors is not there and finally Keri Russell appears tired and distracted.",1394409600,3,186,5.032258064516129
5997882,5,B00FKT9DYK,It was one of those movies that made you laugh out loud.  It even followed the book somewhat which was great to read.  Even my husband liked the movie!,1394409600,,151,4.172413793103448
5997883,5,B00FKT9DYK,"My friends tease me for being overly romantic with a penchant for nostalgia.  This movie satisfied my longing for the days of old when life was simpler, men were chivalrous, and manners were the rule not the exception. (Nevermind that I've never lived in that era, so how do I know that is truly how it was in those days??? But, my imagination says so!)  In short, as mentioned the movie was a delicious dose of Jane Austenism, but it makes just enough fun of itself that my overly practical friends will enjoy it too!

5997884,4,B00FKT9DYK,"If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will love the over-the-top obsession of the main character!  Very funny - Keri Russell does a GREAT job!  Her performance was so great that I had completely forgotten her initial fame through her role as ""Felicity"" on T.V. many years ago.  Jane Seymour also puts on a great performance.  Austenland is like one of Jane Austen's novels on steroids - the colors, the costumes, the acting, the romance - all very surreal - to create the fantasyland that obsessed fans go to to have an ""experience"".  Keri Russell's character, Jane, needs to take this trip, just to wake up and realize how much her life has been on hold because her obsession has de-railed her.  At first, she is a bit sheepish and fumbles her way through the first 24-48 hours of her ""experience"" in Austenland.  She eventually stands up for herself to insure that she has a great journey, and in the end she DOES wake up to reality, with a surprise ending.",1394409600,,955,4.517441860465116

5997886,5,B00FKT9DYK,I loved this movie. I thought the humor was fantastic. Watched it with two guys who didn't like it at all. Might be more for a girl's night in. I think Austen fans will appreciate the mocking-out-of-love attitude of the movie.,1394409600,,226,4.536585365853658

5997888,1,B00FKT9DYK,"It is inconceivable to me that a production with Kerri Russell could turnout so genuinely unlikable. If you labelled this film dreck you would be overrating it. I thought Ms. Russell performance in Adrienne Sheely's 'Waitress,' was absolutely stunning. Again in 'The Upside of Anger,' she was captivating. Her portrayal of Lyla Novacek in 'August Rush' was impressive. But 'Austenland' was the kind of production that can be career ending. Ms. Russell should be more discerning as to how her talents are showcased.",1394323200,3,514,5.204819277108434

I love JJ Feild.  He was the perfect Mr. Henry Tilney in ""Northanger Abbey,"" and does a credible Darcy-type in this movie.  Keri Russell was adorable as the Austen fan girl who spends her life savings on this dubious adventure.

Zany at times, sweet at others, funny throughout.  I do think the direction was a little choppy at times, but overall I enjoyed it.",1394236800,,609,4.392857142857143

I don't remember much about the book so can't compare it to the movie (thankfully), but while the plot is a good concept, the execution is terrible. Keri Russell looked like she was half trying, while Jane Seymour should have gotten more screen time.  Keri also had zero chemistry with the guy playing Mr. Nobley.  Most of the problem I had with the story is, I can't see how the cost to run the mansion, plus pay all the staff, would be less than $30,000 per guest and there were only three women as guests-and it took me till the ending to realize that one of them wasn't part of the ""show"".  And if I'd been Keri's character, I'd have been pretty upset at the ""role"" I'd been given to play, given how much money I'd paid.  My point is, it could have been much better.

It's silly and lighthearted, and all the characters are so over-the-top that you can't help but laugh at the absurd storyline. Jennifer Coolidge was hilarious, as per usual, but for me, it was JJ Field who really stood out. Not only is he insanely attractive, but he plays the Darcy-like character to a T! He and Keri Russell had fabulous chemistry.

5997910,4,B00FKT9DYK,"Based on the novel by Shannon Hale of which I have not read.

Jane Hayes is obsessed with Jane Austen's novels. She is now pushing 30 and realizes that she spent so much time with Jane Austen that she missed out on real life. Her solution is to go on an emersion vacation in which you get to play a Jane Austin like character with a promised romance in the end.

The vacation is not going as planned. So Jane Hayes pulls few strings to make sure she gets what she paid for.

We get to go along on vacation with Jane. We may find ourselves kibitzing a bit. In the end of James get what she seeks? What happens to the other characters in Austinland and. And is everything what it seems?

I found this film to be exactly what it touts to be. This is supposed to be more of a comic satire than a psychological thriller. There are no real surprises here. However it's the great acting and characterization that we enjoy as the story unfolds.

If the viewer just happens to be a Jane Austen fan, they might find this presentation a tad lacking as the only thing related to Jane Austin's a few sound bites here and there now and then without any actual context.

If you're watching the streaming version you have not missed much as the DVD extras are the standard how I made this movie shots. I only saw this in Blu-ray so I cannot comment on any other version; however this is one movie that does lend itself to the Blu-ray treatment.",1394064000,,1428,4.250922509225092

5997913,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Based on the book by Shannon Hale this is a BBC Films adaptation and it is a little corker. We meet Jane Hayes played wonderfully by Keri Russell (`August Rush' and `Mission Impossible III'). She is completely obsessed with Jane Austen and all her works; she even sports a `I Love D'arcy' bag - he is fictional don't ya know. And has a cardboard cut-out of Colin Firth in her flat - dressed as D'arcy.

Well she decides to blow her life savings on a `life changing' trip to theme park extraordinaire, `Austenland'. As the name would indicate this is a total immersion event where you get to live the life of one of Austen's characters for a whole week. This means a trip to England (actually filmed down the road from me in West Wycombe Park). On arrival she discovers that her accompanying guest is fellow American Miss Elizabeth Charming (an Austenland given name) played with over the top brilliance by the excessively talented Jennifer Collidge - `Gentleman Broncos' where she is superb too. She is brash, loud and wants to dress in the costumes so she can have a cleavage to die for - and she steals every scene.

Anyway the week will have its ups and downs - social faux pas and consorting with `the help' from `below stairs' no less. There is also a real live Mr D'arcy and the Mistress of ceremonies is played with measured stuffiness and snobbery by Jane Seymour. Of course all the extras are actors and the lines between reality and fiction are sometimes too blurred to tell apart. As this is based on Jane Austen there is always going to be romance, trouble, heartache and in this case some real gut, laugh humour.

Yes this is a rom com but I absolutely loved it. The soundtrack is Emmy the Great and a great cover of Yazoo's `Only You' is waiting in here to be discovered too. I had better stop before I out `gush' myself. Just can't recommend strongly enough and even the run offs are great - pure quality.",1394064000,,1920,4.48

The last few minutes of the film were better than the rest, but still, no redemption. Part of what I love about the better film adaptations of the original works is that they allow me to slip into a state of mind not dissimilar from reading Austen; ""Austenland"" did the opposite. It was jarring, garish and inane. I knew I wasn't in for a classic, but still, my advice is skip it - or if you just have to see for yourself, wait till you really have nothing better to do.",1393891200,6,647,4.4

In the book she is basically forced to go and learns about herself as she struggles to enjoy herself.  In the movie she spends her entire life savings to go and then still feels out of place, which just makes her frustrated and doesn't really require any development beyond romance.  Way to take a book I love and ruin the movie.  I'm looking at you, Associate Producer Stephanie Meyer.

On a slightly more selfish note, the movie ended by making it impossible to turn the sequel, Midnight in Austenland, into a movie.  I actually loved ""Midnight"" a million times more than the original, and now I'm sad I'll never get to see it on screen.

Even Jennifer Coolidge who I adore was a terrible disappointment. I think the directing just missed the mark. There was no sense of story no particular feeling.

Wonderful if you are in the mood for a romantic comedy with a simple plot. Words like, ""cute"", ""sweet"", ""hilarious"", ""romantic"", and ""feel-good"" come to mind as descriptive for this film.

If you are in the mood for a serious, though-provoking film, this one is not for you. However, if you are tired of stressing out at the office all week and just want to watch something that you don't have to figure out the next move; argue about the ending with a friend; or feel like you've been punched in the stomach when it's over, this is a movie for you.

Save your money and rent Pee Wee's Playhouse because it's very similar. I so wanted to like this movie but I was embarrassed that I rented it from the very first 10 minutes.

5997983,3,B00FKT9DYK,"Face it; the chances of a romantic comedy ever winning an Oscar are almost non-existent. Sure they can be a lot of fun and provide plenty of entertainment (as well as making the choice of a date movie easy) but comedies in general are often overlooked and romantic comedies are considered the red headed step child when it comes to films (no offense to all you redheads or step children out there). The thing is though that some of the most entertaining movies are romantic comedies and such is the case with the DVD release of AUSTENLAND.

Keri Russell stars as Jane Hayes, a young woman obsessed with the books of Jane Austen and all they involve. She dreams of having that one great romance some day where she will be swept off her feet by the perfect gentleman she seeks. The problem is that she is completely over the top with this obsession, so much so that her bedroom is decked out in period pieces and a cardboard cut out of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Then Jane decides she's tired of waiting and takes matters into her own hands. She takes her life savings and goes on a trip to Austenland, a theme park in England based around the author and her books.

When she arrives in England she meets Mrs. Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge), another hopeful going to Austenland. They set out and arrive only for Jane to discover that her vacation package was the copper package and Elizabeth's the platinum. In other words Elizabeth's gets her the best of the best while Jane is sent to the servant's quarters. Run by Mrs. Wattlebrook (Jane Seymour), the ladies are taken to the manor where they seem to have gone back in time. They aren't allowed any modern conveniences (except a toilet) and dress for that time period.

Various events are scheduled and included in the package are several actors portraying men as if they were from one of Austen's novels. Some are forward, some snooty, but all are paid to make the fantasies of these ladies come to life. Along with Elizabeth and Jane is Lady Amelia Heartwright (Georgia King) who seems intent on taking center stage whenever possible.

As the days pass it becomes apparent that Jane is not meeting her expectations of the vacation. Then she meets Martin (Bret McKenzie), the stable hand. They become confidants and grow close, something Jane appreciates since his role is not the same as the actors portraying love interests for the ladies. Has Jane found true love?

The vacation moves forward, the ladies all three become close and the actors do their jobs. Eventually Jane tires of the package she's been assigned and starts flirting with all the actors. One in particular, the stand offish Henry Nobley (JJ Field) begins to change his opinion of Jane. He actually begins to take an interest in her. Just what is going on behind the scenes as much as out front makes for a complicated romance here. Just who will Jane end up with by the final reel, Martin or Henry? Or perhaps no one?

The movie is a delight from start to finish. It moves along at a steady pace and never gets boring. The concept of the theme park and the extent to which they go to bring these ladies dreams to fruition is hilarious at times and sweet at others. There isn't a bad performance in the lot but stand outs are Russell who we don't see enough of these days and Coolidge who is absolutely hilarious in this role. Her butchering of an English accent will bring tears to your eyes.

No, this movie will not win an Oscar. Actually it shouldn't be considered for one. It's not THAT good. But it is quite entertaining and will provide a nice evening's entertainment. So if you're in the mood for a nice romantic comedy that will provide plenty of laughs, give AUSTENLAND a shot. You'll be glad you did.",1393372800,,3740,4.573134328358209

Accomodations and activities depend on which ""package plan"" a visitor chooses.  Keri Russell plays a 30-something single girl who wants to immerse herself in the Regency era through a week's worth of role playing.

I know it is virtually impossible to make a movie exactly like the book, but you can't help but be dissipointed when it is not.

5998016,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Granted I have not read the book! But I love the movie!  The concept seemed to collaborate all the subtle and not so subtle aspects of one's favorite Austen movies mush them together and then introduce a modern woman in search of the Ideal man or shall we say her iconic Mr. Darcy, in a cesspool of modern day dating!  Enter an escape to Austenland, where our heroin can indulge herself in her ideals of a laid back society, of morals, and propriety. With the iconic characters of Austen society. The Avenging Aunt, The Heiress, The doe eyed virgin?, the Bookworm, the Sailor, the Fop, Mr. Wickham aka: the Rake, and of coarse Mr. Darcy aka: Mr. Right.  but wait... our heroin discovers that life in the early eighteen hundreds wasn't all that it's cracked up to be, and starts to rock the boat.  Finding the gumption to rise from the bronze package to become the heroin of her stay at Austenland.  To question who truly is Mr. Right?

Yes there was some aspects that were over the top, but to me in any role playing scenario, it's the people who bring the theatrical, that truly make it memorable. (spoiler) However the end was the most enduring to me, where our hero steps up, becomes the ideal Mr. Darcy and chases her across the pond (Atlantic). If you let something go and it comes back to you, it was meant to be!
On a side note, I enjoyed the morbid humor of the stuffed animals! With a budget that was so modest how else could one afford to have So... many farm and wild life animals with out all the cost incurred for handlers, and rental contracts!

They only took the basic idea and some pieces of the characters. Maybe one day they'll make a tv version of the book- that's verbatim to the novel :)

Once I stopped comparing the movie to the book I was able to appreciate the film and I really like it. The movie basically makes fun of Austen fans but ends up giving us just what we want- an adorable Darcy.

It's a light hearted, clean and easy to watch movie. There's no deep emotional attachment or gripping plot- just a light watch.

The movie is fluffy and campy, but it is not without its charms. It is, however, a very-much fan-centric movie that one kind of has to have read AT LEAST P&P (if not ALL of Austen's works) and know Austen's characters, AND see specifically the 1995 BBC adaptation to get a lot of the material. There are nods to several of the books and the 1995 BBC series, including a cameo that only those who've seen the 1995 series are going to get, throughout the film and if one has not read the material or seen the mini-series, most of the movie is lost in translation. This is NOT a good date movie, which I think got it a lot of early bad reviews, unless your date is ALSO a fan. Watch it with fellow fans only, you'll enjoy it more. Star Ratings: IF you are an Austen fan: 3 1/2 to 4 stars, IF you know next to nothing of Austen: 2 stars. I would strongly suggest RENTING over BUYING.

That being said, the Blu-ray and Special features are minimal for the price of the item. Which sports a commentary, Cast Q&A session and NO DIGITAL COPY. Another reason to RENT first, or just buy on Digital Copy, and the reason for 3 overall stars.",1393113600,2,1263,4.329113924050633

5998024,4,B00FKT9DYK,A different kind of fun. Nice ending to a movie that was starting to drag in the middle. Just happened to run across it by chance being stuck in one afternoon.,1393027200,,159,4.161290322580645
5998025,1,B00FKT9DYK,"I am a HUGE fan of the book - it's such a cute story!!! However, this movie takes Shannon Hale's cute tale of an Austen-esque resort and cheapens it.  It changes the story WAY too much, it is crude, and it is not something I would recommend.  It makes Austenland some resort where people go to get some, in a Regency Era setting.  I honestly wish I hadn't wasted my money on this - I'd much rather read the book.  So if you really were a huge fan of the book, don't waste your money on this.",1393027200,3,491,4.030927835051546

5998027,3,B00FKT9DYK,"This had the potential to be really cute. I should have known when I saw the co-star in the trailer. She tends to be in more slap-stick movies with inappropriate humor. I love the BBC and Austen-style story lines. So, that part was interesting from costumes, etc. I liked the ending. But I could have done without much of the rest: A husband who attempts to assault the female guests. Actors hired to woo the guests. The lead paid for the ""basic"" package so she ended up being treated like a servant, an orphan without a dowry from attire to the actor who mislead her. Some good, but fell short for me. Hence the 3 rating.",1393027200,,622,4.370689655172414

5998033,5,B00FKT9DYK,"First of all, I heard a while back that this movie was coming out but did not get the opportunity to see it in theaters.
Secondly, any woman who has even been interested in Austen, the time in which she wrote about and lived, or has just been looking for their Mr. Darcy would appreciate this movie.
Thirdly, I laughed greatly, was embarrassed for some of the characters, could feel the love of some characters, but overall thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
We all of us, as women, in some point of our lives have been looking for that one person who is going to make everything real for us by showing us who we are as women and how much we mean to someone else.  This is especially important when looking for your Darcy, that when real life comes creeping in through the fantasy we build to protect ourselves, that that special someone is there to help you with their love and support.  This movie not only shows the journey we all face in live regarding who we are and our place in this world, but also shows it through a humorous journey through Austen's world that can often parallel our own world.  I love the ending, especially since I am one of those whom are still seeking their Darcy.
I hope I find my Darcy someday and if it happens to be in a Austen-styled format, that would be great as well.",1392940800,,1301,4.345679012345679

It must have been a roisterous era, back then. The story holds the audience because you never are quite sure who will turn out to be what (in character or real), and that was half of the fun in the film. Russell was having as much fun and Coolidge was a hoot that was not expected.

The men were dreamy and for most of the movie, really had me guessing who was the actual Mr. Darcy of the story.

I would so pay to experience Austenland though!!!! If you want a good laugh and a little romance this is a movie for you. I would suggest any Austen fan watch it.,1392768000,,426,4.023529411764706
5998084,3,B00FKT9DYK,"I have to admit, Im not a Jane Austen aficionado or anything, but I enjoy her stories.  Not all of them, and there is a moment when they all start to blend into one another and I cant tell them apart, but in the hands of a strong directorial voice, they can become something special.  That being said, I know some people who are obsessed with her.  In fact, I know more than some.  I know a couple that has a room in their home dedicated to her work, with paintings of her on the wall, all her books on the shelf (multiple versions and editions, hard and soft, mint condition and tattered) as well as costumes on dress hangers in the corner of the room.  They also attend those Jane Austen festivals every year (I cant remember the name of them) in full garb, and despite being as American as they come, they try their hardest to pull off an English accent while in character.

Ill never get it, but then again, I secretly envy their fearless desire for fun.

Austenland kind of pokes fun at people like them, exposing their cluttered obsessions and then trying to berate their need for a true fantasy romance, and yet at the other end it kind of panders to them as well, providing a happy ending we all saw coming (sort of) and making the obsession kind of rewarding.

When my wife and I saw the preview for this months ago while waiting for Blue Jasmine to start we both knew that we would see it.  I mean, my wife is kind of in love with Jane Seymour, and we both agree that Jennifer Coolidge should be in every comedy.  Besides, the outlandish nature of the subject just seemed ripe for comedy.  Look at Best in Show.  Making fun of human obsessions can really pay off in the end.

This is no Best in Show.

I kind of knew that going in, but a boy can dream.  That isn't to say that Austenland doesnt have some sort of payoff, and it did make me laugh, but the end result isn't as satisfying as I would have wished for.  Instead of taking the risk of actually playing out like a straight up parody of the Austen world, Austenland suffers from turning itself into a modern-day adaptation of her work, and is so concerned with appearing clever in that shift that it winds up deflating its sails a bit and coming across kind of flat.

The film tells the story of Jane Hayes, a desperate woman approaching the end of her child bearing years that is still single and searching for her Mr. Darcy.  The reason she is still single is because her bedroom is a shrine to Jane Austen and shes kind of a freak (more on that in a minute).  So, at the peak of her desperation, she decides to blow her life savings on a trip to Austenland, a place that promises a true Austen experience complete with a fairytale romance and engagement at the end.  Upon arriving, her dreams are crushed by the snobbish Mrs. Wattlesbrook, the owner of Austenland.  She is obviously disgusted with Janes lack of funds (Jane purchased the Copper Package, not the Platinum Package) and because of this she is treated like dirt.  She almost instantly sees the ridiculousness of her personal dreams, finding the antics unfulfilling and seeking solace in her doodling and the arms of the help, Martin, who seems to find the whole thing pretty dumb as well.

But then there is the illusive Mr. Henry Nobley, Janes dream man and the essential Mr. Darcy of the establishment.  Hes handsome, reserved, snarky and strangely charming and he seems to strike up real chemistry with Jane.

But is any of it real?

The knock to reality television and delusional obsessions is obvious, and yet it is never explored deeply enough to be a good character study.  Sadly, the film doesnt do anything well enough to be anything more than confused.  It isn't romantic enough to be a Jane Austen adaptation and it isn't funny enough to be a remarkable comedy or parody.  Instead, it does all things moderately well and becomes an uneven film that could have been something more but settled for being acceptably mediocre.  The supporting cast is pretty great though, with Coolidge, Seymour and Georgia King delivering some hilarious portraits of women caught up in the act.  Coolidge plays the same character in every film, but she does it so well!  Kings whole come hither scene is the best in the film, and that ridiculous outdoor play is a true highlight.  Still, I cant help but feel that the films resolve is a tad obvious in retrospect, and the films inability to decide what it wants to be makes it feel underwhelming.

And I have a serious issue with the normality of Jane Hayes.  Shes far too normal to be portrayed as that obsessive.  It doesnt make sense.  It isn't believable at all.  Her room is utterly ridiculous and all the Austen paraphernalia doesnt jive with who she is, which is nothing more than a shy bookworm.  It was obvious that the screenwriter, Jerusha Hess, was unsure of how far she wanted to go with this.

For me, she didn't go far enough.",1392768000,8,4916,4.4674887892376685

The director, seeing that she is not opulent treats her like a servant, living in servants quarters, she finds even in austenland it is better than her real life.

However, if you're looking for a serious film, this is not the movie for you.  The humor is silly, more Bridget Jones than Pride and Prejudice, but I wonder if all the negative reviews are from people who've forgotten that Jane Austen was herself a pioneer of romantic comedy.  Plus, Austenland is so full of little Easter eggs, like a doll that repeats ""Ten thousand a year!"" when picked up, that I found the movie to be a real delight.

Fun for Elizabeths, but the Darcys out there had best pass on this one.",1392595200,,636,4.410256410256411

It was pleasant. It brought up a few interesting/thoughtful points about immersing oneself in one's fantasy and the blurred lines that go along with that.

It was fun. Some honest giggles. I think this actually could have made an interesting little miniseries and fleshed things out a bit more, because there are some interesting directions it could go.

5998136,1,B00FKT9DYK,"First let me say that I read Austenland and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The characters were well written and the story was engaging.  As an avid fan of Jane Austen I have actually wondered what it would be like to live in that time period.  Following Jane through her very own dream experience was fun.  I liked how her great aunt gave her the trip in hopes that Jane would learn not to judge romance by Jane Austen' s romanticized version.  It was fun to read.

Now on to the movie.  Gone is the interesting meeting with the great Aunt.  Gone is Jane's worried mother. Gone is the chronology of Jane's failed relationships.  Gone is Jane's obvious self discovery that she should be content with herself.  The movie rushed and muddled this point.  Unnecessarily introduced was vulgarity.  The only characters I really recognized from the book were Mr. Nobly  (JJ Field) and Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge).

This was one of the worst movie adaptations of a book that I have seen.  I tried to decide if I didn't like this movie because it was so different from the book or because it wasn't a good movie.  Decision - I didn't think it was a good movie.  VERY disappointing as I really enjoyed the book, waited for the movie as it was not shown near me, and I ADORE Jane Austen.

Jennifer Coolidge was perfectly cast as Miss Charming and JJ Field as Henry Nobley... brilliant. He played another Henry, in Northanger Abbey, so he wears the costume well. The movie was laugh out loud funny and carries the spirit of the book very well. I loved the silliness of the credits too. Initially I rented the movie, but now I have to buy it. Thank you to Shannon Hale and Jerusha Hess for bringing this to my TV screen! You've given me a new favorite bonnet movie. Right next to Lost in Austen.",1392422400,,736,4.37956204379562

Is this film going to be represented at the Academy Awards?  No.  Would SERIOUS Austen scholars have problems with it?  Yes.  Is it a delicious romp through the Regency Era?  Of course!

Now, I love Darcy, I do, but I was always more of a Mr. Tilney fan, so seeing JJ Feild (the ultimate Mr. Tilney in my opinion) was such a plus.  The supporting characters are really silly but laugh out loud fun.  I especially giggled my way through the pool staff area, and the conversations there.  I found myself cheering for Jane, and the ending was very satisfying.  Wish there had been more time for Jane and Mr. Nobley to interact and really build on their attraction; that might have made the happy ending complete.

5998166,2,B00FKT9DYK,"I loved Shannon Hale's novel, ""Austenland"", and was very excited when I learned it was going to be made into a movie.  I waited patiently for the movie to be made, be released in theatres, and then come out on DVD, since it wasn't released in a theatre near enough to my home for me to see it on the big screen.  I read the reviews of those who had seen it on the big screen and was even more excited: the 'regular viewer' crowd was delighted with the movie, and praised it; better and better.  Finally the movie was released, I joyfully opened the package and put in the DVD, and... kept waiting for everything I loved about the novel to appear before me.  It didn't.  I am happy for all those who loved the movie, but it was a terrible disappointment for me.

Beware, mild SPOILERS included.

I am very aware that it is nearly impossible to make a movie that follows a book exactly.  I'm ok with that.  I understand that directors, producers, and screenplay writers take liberties with the original novel, either for practical or artistic reasons; again--ok, fine.  But... when a novel is made into a movie, isn't the basic idea to make the movie so that it follows the book fairly well?  That you want to make a movie that--in the case of Austenland--charms you the way the book did?  That's logical.  My complaint, then, is this: why make a movie where some of the main characters are changed to the point that they are not at all what the book presented them as?  When major plotlines aren't followed?  When sight gags, slapstick, and innuendo take over everything?  It's not at all what I expected, hoped for, and waited for.  As another reviewer suggested, instead of being the eccentric but still relatable girl-next-door or even girl-in-the-mirror type, Jane is presented as crazy obsessed and not at all the girl I laughed with and sympathized with in the book.  Miss Charming is about the only character that translated closely from the novel to the book.  In the movie Captain East is a buffoon and Amelia Heartwright  is as ridiculous as Miss Charming, instead of being the surface-sweet character of the book. And, at the end of the movie, we discover that Mr. Nobley isn't even an actor, which was a big part of the plot of the book, and part of Jane's struggles with liking him.  The movie has Jane spending so much time with Martin that I am surprised she had any time to think of Mr. Nobley at all, in spite of a few pleasant moments and being 'rescued' from the rain (which wasn't much of a rescue, since she was already soaked and then he practically rips her dress off so she can ride astride the horse back to the manor house... which wasn't in the book and wouldn't have been proper for the regency period, AT ALL).

To be fair, there are some nice moments.  The chemistry between Jane and Martin is actually pretty good (although how they meet and how their relationship progresses isn't--again--really as it was presented in the book) and Mrs. Wattlesbrook is played very well.

Bottom line... if you are a big fan of the book, don't expect to see too much of the book in the movie.  If you want to see a movie where a group of pathetic women tries to 'cavort' with male 'escorts'/actors and make fools of themselves in semi-regency dress, this is the one for you.

That being said, I will continue to read Shannon Hale's work but I certainly won't be excited if they turn ""Midnight in Austenland"" or any of her YA fiction into a movie.  I didn't think the group of talented ladies who put the movie together would change the novel so much or stoop to such low-level comedy.",1392422400,67,3599,4.488479262672811

The film did NOT disappoint!

Keri Russell plays Jane, the instantly-likable, easy-to-root-for Jane Austen obsessed 30-something single in search of the perfect gentleman.  Jennifer Coolidge (excellent as the cooky mom in Gentlemen Broncos) delivers much of the film's laughs as Jane's lovably-oblivious-but-supportive Austenland buddy.  (""What are thoooose..."",  ""Tally ho!  A hunting we will go!"")

Really high production value here. Several scenes - particularly the ball - reminded me of the more recent Jane Austen films.  Great attention to detail.  Excellent characters, all the way around.  And - not being familiar with the novel from which the film was based - the ending was unexpectedly good!

To top it off, it's a pretty clean film, which we've come to expect from the Hess crew. (While less tame than Napoleon Dynamite, Gentlemen Broncos and Nacho Libre... Austenland was still REALLY mild compared to modern romantic comedies.)

5998203,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I started reading Shannon Hale's book before watching this movie. But impatient me decided to delay my reading, put the book down and watch the movie instead. If you have read the book, then be prepared for changes. That said, if you go in without expecting this to be exactly like the book, then you won't be disappointed.

As a long time Austen fan, the story line instantly got me hooked. Jane Hayes, a 30-something, is obsessed with ""Pride & Prejudice,"" Jane Austen books and Mr. Darcy. Honestly, to the ladies who have seen the Colin Firth version from 1995, who could blame her? Jane decides to spend her savings on a fantasy-fulfilling vacation to ""Austenland"" - a place where she could transport herself to the Regency era and live like Elizabeth Bennet for a few weeks. She travels to England where she meets her hostess, Mrs. Waddlesbrook (Jane Seymour), and fellow guests Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) and Amelia Heartwright (Georgia King).  Other members of their party are Col. Andrews (James Callis), Henry Nobley (JJ Feild) and Capt. East (Ricky Whittle). As Jane develops friendships with those in her party, she initially forms an attraction to the carefree and easygoing Martin the groomsman (Bret McKenzie). However, she also finds it difficult to avoid the attraction to Henry Nobley, who cuts a dashing and brooding Darcy-like figure. With this fantasy-world then comes a price - what happens when your fantasies become reality? And how do you know if it is real or a pretense?

Fortunately, the movie ""Austenland"" adeptly balances Jane's growing romantic dilemma with some hilarious, laugh-out-loud comedy. There is the ""fish out of water"" element as American newbies Jane and Elizabeth (a nod to P&P, for sure) dive into the pool of British Regency manners and customs, not to mention juggling the accents. This is where Jennifer Coolidge, James Callis and Georgia King often steal the scenes. There are many, many funny moments when any one of them are around.

As the lead, Keri Russell does a great job as Jane. When she first arrives at Austenland, she is a hopeful young woman looking for her Mr. Darcy after one-too-many failed relationships. With the help of Elizabeth and her new friends, her confidence and self-worth grows and she learns to take charge of her fate. The romantic leads, JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie, are equally memorable. I have been a fan of JJ since his supporting role in James D'Arcy's version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" (my favorite version) and he earns extra kudos having played Henry Tilney in ITV's adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey."" Bret will be familiar to ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fans having played one of Elrond's elves and is also a musician. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent and I loved the costumes and beautiful locations with the grand English country house and gorgeous landscapes.

The real draw for me is the story of a die-hard Austen fan having the opportunity to live out that fantasy life. There are those of us out there (who have read the books, seen the film adaptations dozens of times and think Mr. Darcy is dreamy) who probably wouldn't mind having a real ""Austenland"" in England somewhere.  The fact that the movie is also hilarious, well made and well cast is a big bonus. This is a comedy that is at times unapologetically over-the-top (thank you, Jennifer Coolidge). After all, it came from the same people who brought us ""Napoleon Dynamite."" That said, if you like Jane Austen's works and/or want a good laugh, then ""Austenland"" is a must see.",1391644800,3,3571,4.8942148760330575
5998204,3,B00FKT9DYK,"Unlike a lot of women, I don't really hold up Mr. Darcy as the absolute perfect dream guy -- Mr. Tilney is more my speed.

But there's a breed of Austen fans (call them Darcy Fetishists) hold up Darcy and the Regency world as the ultimate standard of romance. One such is the lead of ""Austenland,"" a romcom about a place where people can fulfill their Regency fantasies... and it's too bad the clunky middle section and cartoonishly illogical characters drag it down.

Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is allegedly the biggest Austen freak in existence, although she seems uninterested in everything Austen except romance and Mr. Darcy (as depicted by Colin Firth). Forget the social commentary, proto-feminism and all non-Darcy men! She is so obsessed that every relationship she has comes up short... so unsurprisingly, she jumps at the chance to go to a theme resort known as Austenland.

And at first it seems like a dream come true -- guests wear period clothing, do period activities, and even get a staged romance. Then she becomes the focus of a love triangle with the shy, gruff Mr. Nobley (JJ Feild) and the charming servant Martin (Bret McKenzie). The lines between fantasy and reality begin to blur, and Jane begins to realize that her ideal man must be one in the REAL world.

""Austenland"" has a cute premise, albeit one as light and fluffy as meringue. It's fairly obvious how some parts of it are going to play out -- really, does anyone expect Jane NOT to find her dream guy in this resort? -- but the amusement comes from watching Jane discover that playing at Regency romance is not as satisfying as the real thing, and her bumbles along the way. For instance, she discovers that being a Regency-era lady was kinda boring, since they were expected to sit indoors and sew.

Unfortunately, Jerusha Hess's direction is mediocre. The entire movie grinds to a crawl in the second act, where we're treated to the characters just meandering around, not doing anything. There are a few clever nods to Austen's books (the play, the old naval flame) which seem to go completely over Jane's head (since those books didn't star Mr. Darcy), but the cleverness drowns in a sea of much more obvious, crude humor.

Keri Russell is fairly likable as Jane, and adds an earnest likability to the role... which is good, because Jane herself has the intellectual capacity of a clever cabbage. But JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie are very charming, both as a stern, awkward Darcy-type and as a handsome gardener -- although if you've EVER seen ""Pride and Prejudice,"" you will see the twist coming several miles away.

The problem is, everybody who ISN'T in the love triangle is an idiotic cartoon, devoid of the slightest hint of depth. Jennifer Coolidge is utterly wasted as a crude, man-hungry bimbo who doesn't know the first thing about Austen (raising the question of WHY she came there), and the other characters have exactly one character trait and nothing more -- the closeted gay man, the pervert, the stuck-up owner, the vindictive blonde. It's as if Hess can only make Jane likable if she makes everyone else a blithering moron or a jerk.

""Austenland"" is only saved from being awful by a solid central cast, despite wasting the supporting one -- watch it for JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie in breeches, and try to ignore everyone else.",1391644800,11,3327,4.753899480069324

5998206,4,B00FKT9DYK,"I had to rewatch the movie to enjoy it for what it IS, rather than what it isn't. It's not the book. It's scraps of the book w a LOT of dramatic license. That being said, it's a silly, goofy movie that doesn't take itself seriously. The actors must have had a blast w this because everyone is so over the top in the best possible way. The parts that were recognizable from the book didn't really work because it felt forced into a story that wasn't very true to it. There wasn't enough context for a line to be spoken because you're missing all of lead up to it. Ending was cheesy,  but watch through the credits. Amelia and Lizzie steal every scene they're in, and major props to whoever came up w the soundtrack. I was cracking up.",1391472000,4,733,4.235714285714286

5998208,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Loved this movie!  I am a huge Shannon Hale fan, but surprisingly was left wanting more at the end of the first Austenland novel.  I loved the second novel more than the first.  I was weary of watching a book adaption, as so many fall short, but this movie was wonderful!  It brought aspects from both novels into the movie.  It was produced by Shannon Hale, so you knew her stamp of approval was on the film.  It was hilarious.  It was perfect fun for all those true Jane Austen fans and hopeless romantics like myself.  I really loved it and will probably watch it again and again.",1391472000,5,583,4.333333333333333
5998209,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I truly enjoyed the novel this movie was based on and I was not disappointed by the adaptation to film. Being a bit of an Austen-ophile myself I really hooked into the concept.... nerdy, lonely gal, looking for love in all the wrong places, fantasies fulfilled? Or maybe not.... Austenland -lovingly- pokes fun at all us Regency loving ladies who pine away for our elusive Darcies. It's adorable, cheeky, fun and above all VERY romantic. I was a little disappointed in the running time as I felt another 20 minutes or so to fill in some personal details or dating history for poor Jane and even Henry would have been appropriate... the book did a better job with this, as is usually the case. But even so, the length worked for the most part.

JJ Feild is delicious in his Darciness, Jennifer Coolidge DIVINELY absurd as the comically ridiculous Miss Charming and all in all, this movie was cast very excellently. Spit Spot! ;p  (I actually wish Ms. Coolidge had used even more of her fake British vocabulary!) Prepare yourself to be entertained, don't take this story OR yourself too seriously and you too, can immerse yourself in all things Austen. It's a delight from start to finish. (I purchased the digital copy so I can watch it over and over, alternating with my BBC Pride and Prejudice.)",1391472000,14,1296,4.6798245614035086
5998210,5,B00FKT9DYK,"Sometimes I just have to go against the grain.

I read Austenland by Shannon Hale a while back when a friend recommended it to me. I enjoyed it a lot, thinking it witty, fresh and fun. So, when I heard they were making it into a movie, I was excited.

Then it was released. I waited, hoping our local theater would receive it. After a week or two of it being a no-show, I called the cinema's manager. No. There was no way they were getting it. . . ever!

In the end, my husband and I had to travel three hours to see it at the only theater showing it in Arizona. Can you imagine? (Good thing my sister-in-law was having her surprise 40th birthday party in the same area, the next day.)

So. . .what was my opinion of it you might be asking (after traveling three hours and hitting rush hour traffic in Phoenix/Scottdale area and witnessing a fender bender). Well. . .in two words--LOVED IT!

And that is how I am going against the grain. From what I can tell, Austenland's critical reviews aren't the best. But, I loved it! It was witty, fresh and fun! I belly-laughed so many times I started to cry--literally. Heck, I wasn't the only one belly-laughing. The whole (almost packed) theater was having a great time, including the handful of men that braved the book clubs of the greater Phoenix area. Even my husband (good man that he is for indulging me in this) is scratching his head as to why all the negative reviews.

Sometimes, I want to say, ""People, lighten up! It's supposed to be fun and silly, and a bit of spoof for all of us crazed Jane Austen fanatics. Relax and enjoy the clean humor.""

If you are able to see Austenland, I hope it does for you what it did for me and my husband--a pleasant surprise that was well worth the three hour drive!",1390867200,8,1756,4.303030303030303
5998211,5,B00FKT9DYK,"I adored this movie, and got to see it twice in the theaters (once at Sundance, once in theatres). It's a fun escape, well acted, and just a feel-good movie all around. Can't wait for the Blu-ray!",1390867200,10,196,4.324324324324325
5998212,4,B00FKT9DYK,"This movie is not one that would automatically attract someone who isn't already a fan of Jane Austen books, movies & miniseries.  Therefore it was important that above all else they stay true to it's progenitor, and by that I don't mean the book it's based upon, but the books upon which the book this movie is based upon, was based upon.  Did you follow that?

The comedy may be rough or simple, the production quality may vary in parts, but at it's core this romantic comedy keeps at it's heart the love of simplicity in romance that was in all of Austen's novels.

In the end it's a movie you enjoy so much because you honestly didn't expect so much to come out of it, and I mean that in the best way.",1389916800,6,705,4.2388059701492535

8616424,4,B00FKT9DYK,"The book was amazingly hilarious and there were some key changes from the book to the movie to the point where the main outline is the same but the actual story is different.  Parts of what I really liked in the book: that Austenland was a retreat for wealthy women who would take acting classes to have ""better"" storylines, that the protagonists' main love interest was not actually an actor but subbing in as a favor to his Aunt, and the portrayal of how truly dull life was in Austen's time were cut.  However, this movie replaced these elements with things that work really well on screen and so while missed I felt that it was still a really fun adventure story though may have leaned to the rom-com trope a little too much at times.",1531008000,,738,4.419117647058823
