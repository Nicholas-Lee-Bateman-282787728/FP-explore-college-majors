8717954,5,B00YAZNCT2,"Weird, eerie, atmospheric ... Apocalyptic.
A drugged out End-Times Dracula that hews closer to the original story while at the same time taking completely new angle on it -
Low budget but effective, includes the trephination sequence from the book, the first version I believe to do so.
Dracula compleatists should get it while it's still in print.",1461628800,,348,5.017241379310345
8717955,5,B00YAZNCT2,"I loved it. Action packed,Vampires rule. Please keep up the great work.",1454284800,,71,5.0
8717956,4,B00YAZNCT2,"This was a fun film. Most people these days forget how to be entertained by a film. They are the ones who go see a film and have a great time thru the whole thing then at the end, they turn it off and discover..."" I think I hated that film"". It is so cool to be negative, that if people gave a movie like this a fair shot and did not judge on such lofty goals for a film that had a low budget.",1444435200,,393,3.635294117647059
8717957,1,B00YAZNCT2,"Worst rubbish ever. I can't believe anyone made this and thought it was good enough to watch. I really don't care about the $10 but this is unwatchable. I am a ""B"" movie  and horror/sci-fi fan and I could not get anything out of this. STAY AWAY from this disjointed waste of time.",1444176000,5,280,4.283018867924528
8717958,1,B00YAZNCT2,"Well, I would have given this film a ""zero"" if it were possible.  It's virtually unwatchable, in my opinion.  B&W film with color in spots.  The eerie mood, music and special effects earn at least a ""1"" rating, I suppose.  With most of the settings supposed to occur in London, England one would have thought there might be some attempt at English accents.  None here!  All the actors sound quite American.  I just got it today and discovered I can't resell it for anything.  I'm throwing my copy of this DVD in the garbage right now.",1443830400,2,534,4.489583333333333
