7921063,3,B00004RFAF,"Never having seen Twelvetrees really act before - THE PAINTED DESERT is the only other film in which I've seen her in - I was quite impressed by her believable emoting in this film which is essentially a pre-code soap opera. Soon after her father dies, young Millie Blake leaves college to elope with a businessman named Jack Maitland.  They go to live in NYC where they eventually have a daughter: but soon Millie suspects her husband isn't on the up and up....An interesting curio - with a more lucrative plot than one would suppose, it is a good showcase for the actress - who could actually act.  The supporting cast is interesting: Joan Blondell, Frank McHugh, Lilyan Tashman, Anita Louise and John Halliday.",1041984000,2,713,4.741935483870968
7921064,3,B00004RFAF,"The lovely talented Miss Twelvetrees displays her talent in this pre-code soaper covering 16 years.  Millie (Miss Twelvetrees) marries a New Yorker and moves to the big city.  3 years later Millie finds her husband lunching (and kissing) with another woman.  She divorces but leaves her child with the father.  She has no money but he has the big house and income.
She goes to work at a stationary counter and gradually works her way up, gaining the notice of a big shot business man and a down to earth reporter.  When the Millie finds the reporter spending time at another woman's apartment, she loses hope and takes to drinking and loose morals (prostitution).  Years later, Millie hears how the big business man is after her now 16-year old daughter (the one left behind during her divorce).  Millie rushes to the scene and shoots him.  For the dramatic conclusion........buy the video.
Helen Twelvetrees goes through a very believable transformation from young school girl to burn-out middle age drunk.  The final scenes are very good and dramatic.  I recommend this film to pre-code fans, Helen Twelvetree fans and anyone who enjoys old soap dramas.  Helen is worth watching.",971827200,4,1181,4.944162436548224
