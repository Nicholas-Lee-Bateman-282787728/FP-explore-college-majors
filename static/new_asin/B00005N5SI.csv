1628418,5,B00005N5SI,This is a terrific movie. It was so heartwarming!!! Very Funny!!! Just a all around great movie!!!!,990489600,2,99,4.882352941176471
1628419,1,B00005N5SI,"I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie.  The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!!  I couldn't wait!  Then I saw the movie..........What happened?  How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way?  All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault.  I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer?  Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right?  So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing??????  I can't go on.............",990403200,6,690,4.544715447154472
1628420,5,B00005N5SI,"I really enjoyed this movie. It truly warmed my heart to see the values and struggles of the black family brought to the big-screen in such an endearing way. In fact, I think you'll see how much the actors and actresses enjoyed their roles.  What marvellous performances! What an excellent story line! I really wish that they had put more money into this film though. The cinematography seems a little low-budget, some close-up scenes are blurred. Nevertheless, the story line still shines true. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection... somewhere between ""Gladiator"" and ""The Best Man."" Well done!",988070400,8,607,5.00990099009901

1628436,5,B00005N5SI,"What a great cast and story line and so many laughs!! Really loved the relationship between Loretta Divine & Darius McCrary. Loretta is the over-dramatic, very emotional mother who is disgusted by her son's lifestyle and Darius is the unemployed, laid-back son annoyed by his intrusive mother. Loved all of Loretta's & Darius's scenes in this movie, these characters suited their personality and they played their role very well. 3 of Loretta's & Darius's scenes that I really loved were when 1) Loretta & Darius were in that hot car arguing, 2) when they were arguing as they walked down that road in the heat, 3) when they sat on the rail arguing as they waited for LL to pick them up and Loretta was asking Darius what he was going to do with his life then Darius told her his plans, which included being on welfare which really got her disgusted and fired up. Those scenes were hilarious! I love Cedric the Entertainer, he is so talented, he's a very funny comedienne and he can also sing, act and dance. I loved him in this movie as the minister, I really loved the scene when he was preparing a sermon as the 3 ladies of the choir sang and he said this line, ""call God, don't call me,"" that was hilarious! Loved the dysfunctional family between Jada & Anthony Anderson and their bad kids, loved that scene in the car when Anthony threatened to kill everybody including himself,LOL. Loved the scene when Jada had a breakdown at the funeral after finding out Anthony slept with Bernice Talbert. Loved the scene when LL & Anthony had the fight in the living room. Both Anthony & LL are great actors. I have loved every role Anthony has played, I really love him as the host of award shows, he is fantastic & I love him currently on the tv show, Black-ish. I really love LL, he is so talented, I love how he went from a rapper to the tv then to the big screen, he was a great rapper and he is a great actor. Vivica Fox is a great veteran actor so of course she is great in any role. I loved Vivica as LL's wife who was the calm one and the voice of reason who kept everything together. Character Clyde who was LL's supervisor at the repair shop was very funny. Toni Braxton had 2 scenes and she did a great job. Whoopi's role as the mother was pretty low-key, not really outrageous but she played her character well because she is a great veteran actor. Actually, everybody did a great job and the movie is great and absolutely hilarious!! I had to have it for my collection.",1480896000,,2477,4.375271149674621

1628471,5,B00005N5SI,"This has to be one of my very favorite comedies. Done brilliantly! The mourning of a loved one is the most difficult time for everyone one time or another. Family is who you count on during that process, unless your this family.
This movie is so touching, warm, honest, and tells you not to mourn your loved one but to celebrate the life they lived, even if they were ""MEAN & SURLY""
Your instantly are drawn to all the members of this family. They warm your heart, you feel what they're feeling, and you watch with a smile & and are laughing endlessly.  When the credits go up, you feel good.
Whatever your religious beliefs may or not be, if your white or someone of color, you will find a spirit to this movie, it really will make you feel good. You might even feel differently about that certain family member.
You will remember the cast of this movie, because it will leave you feeling better.
Get this movie, you won't be sending it back",1438214400,,942,4.382857142857143

As the town swelters in the summer heat, family tensions reach a comedic boil as the Slocumb clan comes together to remember their dearly departed. The long-suffering Charisse is sick of her bumbling, unfaithful husband Junior. The scripture-spouting Marguerite prays to save her hard-living son Royce whose chief ambition is a life on welfare. Family peacekeeper Lucille has her hands full with a money hungry funeral director, and her husband, Ray Bud, who would rather bury his family than his father. This is a good movie. Believe it or not, this is a movie that could be viewed by all family members. Little profanity, drug use, or sexual references this movie had everything a family movie could have.

1628545,5,B00005N5SI,"Movie Kingdom Come's great surprise actor was LL Cool J, whose acting was superb.  He is the star of the movie, named Ray Bud, becoming the patriarch in his family at the death of his father.  And, he pulls it off with a class act.  Of course, actress Vivica Fox does an exellently superb acting as his perfect wife, Lucille, who is trying to keep her own problems to herself, namely issues trying to have children.  Loretta Devine is another great actress in every movie she takes on.  In this one, she brings out the comedy of a religious sister-in-law, Aunt Marguerite, burdened with being a widow with two delinguent sons who she tries to whip into action with her religious tongue.  Jada Pinkett plays a comedy part in this movie as the wild & crazy Sharese, a low-class wife of Junior, Ray's brother.  She wanted a singing career before her marriage and kids.  Junior is played by Anthony Anderson, who is great with comedy anyway.  He stars as the penniless brother with wild ideas, no common sense and he and Sharese are saddled with three bratty children.  Darius McCrary does an excellent acting job as Ray's delinquent cousin, Royce, son of Marguerite, who finally matures at the end.  The actor that plays the part of the auto repair shop owner, Clyde, Ray's boss, is so thoroughly hilarious with his scenes from start to finish.  Toni Braxton is the beautiful rich in-law married to a lawyer cousin who shows up to the funeral alone and reveals to Sharese that she should appreciate her husband and her poor life because riches don't always equal happiness.  The movie also stars Cedric-the-Entertainer who plays off his part so well as the lisp-speaking minister, over-burdened but sincere.  It's revealed from the beginning of the movie that Ray Bud's father lived the last years of his life as a grouch with Mrs. Bud, starred by Whoopie Goldberg, choosing not to hide her dislike of her husband's ways.  Whoopie Goldberg shows her excellent acting skills to the hilt with such a beautiful low-key portrayal of a patient quietly intelligent newly-widowed mother of two men, Ray and Junior.  Junior is so caught up in his own crazy hopscotch life, trying to make up to Sharese for his promiscuious affair that he doesn't contemplate overmuch seeing his father's coffin.  Cousin Royce already lost his father to death and shows Ray that its alright to feel hurt over the death of his father.  It's up to Ray to show and reveal how he felt about his father.  Beautifully revealing and also an entertainingly funny movie.",1243641600,,2532,4.76605504587156

1628559,4,B00005N5SI,"Whoopie Goldberg, LL Cool J, Loretta Devine and Jada Pinkett - Smith star in this overlooked little comic gem of a movie. The supporting cast, including Cedric the Entertainer, are also on hand to bring to life a funny farce on death and dying, dysfunction and survival. Admittedly, perhaps a few of the plot devices may be trite, but it's very rare for a movie not to have a few over used plots or farcial moments. This movie is all about family surviving family and life and trying to rise above whatever life has in store - be it fate or human blunder. Goldberg plays Mama Rae, a stoic and strong woman, who does know her own mind. When her husband drops dead at the breakfast table, she continues on - with an assortment of family members and friends who are coming home to "" help "" her. The always amazing Loretta Devine, the bombastic, morally and religiously effusive, bounds onto the screen and doesn't stop chewing the scenery throughout her turn as Aunt Marguerite - the long suffering sister of the recently departed Bud and the mother of two lowdown sons, who try her patience at every turn. LL Cool J is the eldest son of Mama Rae and Bud, who battles his own demons, but seems to bring stability to a very fractured family. Pinkett - Smith is the one person that every family seems to have - The Drama Queen and the Eternal Victim. The rest of the cast deserves to be singled out, but time and space is limited. The bottomline is - this is a movie that can make you laugh - even if you stop laughing and think - "" this reminds me of someone in MY family. "" It ain't brain surgery, folks and not all movies have to be or even should be.

1628562,4,B00005N5SI,"We all have families composed of a great many different
personalities.  Some are crazier than others but deep down if we consider
them family we love them.  Kingdom Come shows up what happens when they are
all forced to get back together for a tragedy.
 Whoopi Goldberg plays the long-suffering matriarch of the family who
watches her mean and nasty husband drop dead at breakfast one morning.  Now
her sister and all of their children, except for...well you know...he's
still in jail, are all coming home for the funeral.  The rest of the movie
details how they all come together as a bunch of crazy, fighting individuals
and end together as a family.
 The story was a little weak.  A lot of it was stereotypical but the
acting more than saved it throughout.  In fact the performances carried the
movie well over the top in quality.  Whoopi played the quiet matriarch
dispensing wisdom as needed.  LL Cool J played her oldest son, the
recovering alcoholic, who is struggling with his own fear of death and the
infertility problems he and his wife seem to be having.  Anthony Anderson
played the younger son as a dreamer stuck with a hot-headed wife and
multiple kids.  Cedric the Entertainer portrays the town preacher as a man
full of advice...and other more shallow problems near the end.

1628563,2,B00005N5SI,"I thought this film was so bad that I wanted to spray my VCR with Lysol when it was over! YECCH! This ""comedy"" deals with a very unlikeable and unappealing family's events surrounding the death of their equally unlikeable father. Sounds like a real knee-slapper, right? Yes folks, it's as funny as it sounds as 99% of the characters are incredibly annoying to watch and are almost to a one without redeeming qualities. Bitter old women, trifling and lazy men, bratty kids, ad nauseum.
BUT- LL Cool J (James Todd Smith)'s character does have a nice moment at the funeral where he tries to make some sense out of all this nonsense and straighten out this ultra-dysfunctional motley crew. Thus it gets two stars instead of one from me. However, the mess that one has to sit through to get to this good part near the end just ain't worth it. Don't waste your time.
However, the one interesting thing about this film is that it is one of the few films of recent times with a Black cast where race isn't even MENTIONED or bears no relevence to the plot. In fact, this could have easily been done with a White cast. I guess that's equality when Blacks have just as much opportunity to make bad films as Whites!",1022025600,5,1203,4.472727272727273

No one in this extended family can really find anything much better to say for him, and yet they're forced to come together for the man's funeral.  Some of them, apparently, haven't spoken in years.  But invariably, as they combine to plan the funeral, they find themselves re-examining their feelings, not only about the departed, but for each other and even about themselves.
Pretty heavy-sounding stuff for a comedy, isn't it?
Trust me on this, it works as a comedy here.  In fact, it works as a wildly -- and at times, wickedly -- funny comedy.  It works for two reasons, primarily: First off, the laughs aren't ""cheap"" or forced; secondly, and equally importantly, there is no ""butt"" of all the jokes . . .  each character, even a marvelously ineffective minister (Cedric the Entertainer), is granted his or her validity as a person.  (The minister, for example, for all his bumbling, serves to redeem the eldest son -- LL CoolJ -- in a moment of personal crisis.)
There is a true universality to this film that, sadly, during its theatrical release, was overlooked by most people due to the fact that it was marketed primarily as a ""black"" film.  It is no such thing.  This family, with its individual members and their individual problems, could be ANY family, virtually ANYwhere.  The love they rediscover, the strengths and the hope they find, is what 'family' is all about.

Viveca Fox (in a surprisingly disappointing performance) and Jada Pinkett Smith (who tries to be charming but ends up going over the top with her role) play their wives. The film's best moments come from the very funny Loretta Devine as the ultra religious and highly exasperated aunt whose dresses always match her Bible; she comes as close as possible to giving this film some good rhythm. Other than that, the film has no real moments of tenderness, no exposition of character depth, nor much payoff in the end.

1628576,5,B00005N5SI,"Wow what a great cast. Movie had some very funny moments and some parts that were very touching and endearing. Great performance from Anthony Anderson, he is on his way to superstardom. Anthony and Jada have real chemistry and I hope they do another film together. Another standout performance from Vivica Fox. Clyde was my favorite character, he had me on the floor with laughter. The only negative thing is sometimes the script kinda made some of the characters look like caricatures instead of real people. Very funny performance from Jada.",1001808000,2,543,4.978021978021978
1628577,5,B00005N5SI,"Well, ladies and gentleman, I too have read the reviews, which give it the aura of movies like the Omega Code (if anyone ever will remember that mess).  But I watched at our inadequate AAFES theatre, and it was great!  Although the big fogiveness thing in the end was a little corny, the movie really showed a disfunctional African American family that had both the Godly side of their culture, and also the 'other' side.  ...",997228800,4,426,4.578947368421052
1628578,5,B00005N5SI,"When this movie was released in theaters, it received bad reviews and I wondered out loud: ""What movie was the critics watching????""  This movie is awesome!  I was completely drawn into the story because I could relate on a very personal level to all the things that happened in the movie, from beginning to end.  The music was wonderful, too.  I couldn't find anything to dislike about ""Kingdom Come.""  It was the southern version of ""Soul Food"" only better.  If you buy this DVD, you won't go wrong!",995932800,5,501,4.636363636363637
1628579,5,B00005N5SI,"I liked Kingdom Come.  Especially, when it had my favorite singer, Toni Braxton in it.  She did a very good job for her first movie.  I thought the movie was heartwarming.  A family type movie. It was full of life.  A down to earth movie.  Just like real life situations.  The movie really meant something to me.  Sometimes it has to take someone to die to bring the family together.  I highly reccommend this movie to all ages.  Full of laughs.  Cedric the Entertainer will have you cracking up all through the movie.  He's so hilarious. This is a gotta see movie.",991785600,4,565,4.431372549019608
