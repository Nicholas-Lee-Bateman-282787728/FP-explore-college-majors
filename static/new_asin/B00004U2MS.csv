1353651,5,B00004U2MS,"I grew up in the space biz, and worked in it for about a decade, so I know a lot of its history - ins and outs that the majority of folks just never hear about or have forgotten.
But this NOVA special had a few surprises even for me, and lots of wonderful details and glimpses into the background - both political and personal - of the players during the early, ""golden"" years of the American space program.
HIGHLY recommended to anyone with an interest in space, or in mid-20th century American history.",1028937600,,504,4.372340425531915
1353652,5,B00004U2MS,"This disc is excellent, tells the whole story with lots of film, interviews and animated graphics. However, just a quick note here to say that it also works across the pond in the UK. I don't believe it has a Region Code at all - just plays on my (unmodified) Playstation 2. It is NTSC, not PAL, but that hasn't been a problem to my Sony TV....and it's the first time I've seen any film of the Soviet moon programme; there's not much but it's very interesting.",1019088000,3,460,4.2988505747126435
1353653,4,B00004U2MS,"As a NASA employee of the (then) Manned Spacecraft Center, I was the rendezvous training instructor for Apollo 11.  I was interested in hearing the history of Apollo before 1965, when I joined, and particularly the genesis of lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR), which became my preoccupation and specialty.  I do regret that in this telling, as in nearly all others (Apollo 13, etc.), there is no indication that there was a separate organization of support engineers for the astronauts (Flight Crew Operations Directorate), which often had issues with the flight controllers,  who were not the sovereign ""Masters of the Universe"" they portray themselves to be in memory. We often found ourselves arguing issues of on-board capability and autonomy vs. ground control with the Flight Operations Directorate (Chris Kraft, Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney, et. al.).  After Apollo, these guys won that argument with the result that both the shuttle and space station are -by design- annexes to the Mission Control Center.",1016755200,6,1004,5.25625
1353654,5,B00004U2MS,"...P>For anyone who is an Apollo or NASA buff, there's really nothing new here.  What I found of particular interest was the focus on the contributions of Apollo 8.  In fact, Apollo 8's story is really the heart of this documentary.  However, the movie never once overlooks the importance of the Gemini program, or the other important events in the race to the moon.  I especially liked the small segment on John Houbolt and his rather aggressive quest to make NASA see that Lunor Orbit Rendevous was the only way to get to the moon.
No two-hour documentary on the moon landings can be comprehensive, but this is an essential documentary for anyone interested in this era of US history.  The interviews alone are worth the price of the disk.",994377600,8,741,4.6692307692307695
1353655,5,B00004U2MS,"This DVD is simply excellent. Even though it is obviously a TV show, and still feels a bit like a TV show, with all the gaps and moments full of suspense right before the (non existent) commercials. It does a bit more than document the struggle to get to the moon, (from a very subjectively American perspective.) What this DVD mainly carries as a message is the struggle that goes into any project. Be it the first Moon landing, be it just a small improvement, like additional handles on a space capsule. The show keeps the story on a very realistic, very personal level. Interviews with astronauts and experts turn the great leap for mankind back into small steps, which make a story a great story. You should watch this DVD if you are working on a complex project and would like to get creative inspiration. You should probably watch this DVD with your team and discuss how you would have solved many of the problems. You will probably miss extensive footage of the first lunar landing. There is hardly any of it on this DVD. There is also no mention of the Russian Lunohod project. But again, this documentary describes something more universal than the race to the moon. It describes the possibility of success in seemingly hopeless situations. It describes the real possibility of success through the synergy of a team even under the most impossible deadlines. It explains that what sometimes looks like a failure, can still be a step toward a much greater achievement. This documentary is very, very inspiring.",984441600,11,1517,4.75
1353656,5,B00004U2MS,"This NOVA documentary, originally aired in July 1999, features two hours of the American efforts to reach the moon at its finest.  The footage of  the famous Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo flights is very riveting, featuring  interviews from astronauts such as Jim Lovell, Tom Stafford, Eugene Cernan,  Buzz Aldrin, David Scott, and Wally Schirra, as well as with Robert  Seamans, Christopher Kraft, and Gene Kranz.  It is hard to accurately  portray through a video the details of the American space program, but this  video comprehensively contains all the candor and excitement of the  American manned moon program.  John Houboult's Lunar Orbit Rendezvous  scheme is detailed, with his efforts to sell the idea to top NASA  management.  Then, it moves on to the Gemini flights, emphasizing the first  rendezvous of manned spacecraft on Gemini 6/7 in 1965, Gene Cernan's EVA  troubles that plagued Gemini 9, and Gemini 12.  Finally, it details the  Apollo program that placed man's footprints on the moon, focusing on the  engineering flights of Apollo 8 and 11, and then the scientific and  geologic flights of the lunar landing missions that followed, ending with  Apollo 17.  All this was very fascinating, and thrilling to watch.",966816000,19,1232,5.152284263959391
1353657,5,B00004U2MS,"Since the death of Neil Armstrong, I have been revisiting all things Apollo.  I purchased this DVD when my wife and I were at the Kennedy Space Center.  It is a very well-produced documentary of all that was involved in putting a man on the moon.

It goes through the history of how we got to the moon.  When the Russians successfully launched Sputnik, the U.S decided to enter the space race.  With the creation of NASA during the Eisenhower Administration, the DVD progresses through the various stages in the nation's quest to reach the moon, namely, the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.  The DVD makes clear how important each step was to the goal of reaching the moon.  While there is no interview of the first man on the moon, the last man on the moon, Eugene Cernan, contributes his thoughts to the documentary.  Hearing of his harrowing space walk, in which he tried to work in space, is very interesting.  That failure to accomplish his assigned tasks caused NASA to reevaluate how they trained their astronauts to work in space.  The DVD is very good at pointing out how failures were something to be learned from, and thereby corrected.

The DVD is two hours long.  There are a lot of great interviews with astronauts in it.  The reunion of the Apollo 13 astronauts is enjoyable.  This is a great documentary! It is worth watching.  It is science applied to human goals.  It is inspiring.  I was eleven years old when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon.  It gave me goose bumps back then.  I get goose bumps watching this DVD today.  What a great human achievement.  It was a great American achievement.  Five stars all the way!",1346284800,,1659,4.609589041095891
1353658,5,B00004U2MS,"This is another excellent documentary video from Nova. In this DVD, the viewer is given a fine overview of the American effort to reach the Moon before the Soviets. In this video, we see the controversies, the risks we were willing to take, the intermediary steps made in which the US learned the lessons needed to reach the moon as well as the triumphs and tragedies.

The movie begins of course with US reaction to Soviet successes in space from the first satellite to the first man in space to the first spacewalk. The DVD covers the Mercury missions only briefly while spending appropriate time on the different theories on how best to design vehicles to get to the Moon and back, finally deciding on lunar rendezvous.

The DVD spends more time on the Gemini missions which were much more important to the project to reach the moon. They were the testing ground for rendezvous and docking, working in space, long-term space flights and space walks. Time is spent on the tragedy of Apollo 1 and the lessons learned. The DVD gives the viewer an understanding of the construction of the Apollo spacecraft as well as the risks taken to speed up the program.

The film covers the Moon missions themselves as well as the desire to use the missions to gain scientific knowledge, setting up devices for measuring the Moon's distance from the earth as well as collecting samples of the Moon's surface. The video spends some time on the training of Astronauts in geology. The last mission was flown with a trained geologist as a member of the crew.

This is a first-rate documentary without a flaw I could detect. The interviews with the astronauts and other NASA personnell are lively, sometimes humorous, enlightening and always interesting. The period film footage of missions is excellent as is the analysis of the scientific and poltical issues that drove the race to the Moon.

This is an excellent documentary that gets five stars from this reviewer and I do recommend it.",1338076800,,1973,4.774193548387097
1353659,5,B00004U2MS,"I'm a space buff with a masters degree in Aero/Astronautical Engineering, and this documentary is by far my favorite of the bunch. I have enjoyed watching it multiple times. The DVD, like many produced by public television entities, lacks bells and whistles, but that should not stop anyone from picking up this fantastic documentary of the US space program from Mercury to Apollo 17 (with a some interesting tidbits of the Soviet program in there too!).",1325635200,,454,4.9868421052631575
1353660,5,B00004U2MS,I love this video!  I've watched it at least four times now (I use it in an astronomy class I teach) and originally had it on VHS.  I decided to get it on DVD so that it would be easier to jump around.  There really isn't any part of this that is boring or repetitive.  Great original footage as well as interviews with the astronauts in present day.  Very eye-opening and highly reccomended!,1288483200,,392,4.315068493150685
1353661,4,B00004U2MS,"A very good presentation beginning with the Mercury missions, through Gemini, and ending with Apollo 17.  Not all the Apollo missions were detailed, but this video presented a nice, though compact, history of Americas race to the moon.  I like the fact that Russia's missions were presented along with some video footage, plus how Apollo changed from simply ""let's beat the Russians there"" to a geological survey, with a good bit of info on how the later Apollo astronauts were given serious geological training.  No extras, but worth the price.",1272153600,,545,5.033333333333333
1353662,4,B00004U2MS,"The one scene where you can clearly see a tall structure like a tower on the moon is worth the price of the movie alone. The rest is just ok,fairly interesting to boring.
 The internet rumours are true,NASA missed editing out that one!
They're watching us,astronaut Mitchell was right.",1259020800,,285,4.816326530612245
1353663,5,B00004U2MS,"This documentary, intended for the 30th anniversary (1999) of the first lunar landing, covers the period from 1957 through 1972. The viewer soon learns that the mission to the moon had less to do with adventure and scientific curiosity, and more to do with Cold War realities--specifically the humiliations of Sputnik and Gagarin.

How to reach the moon? Earlier proposals involved landing a huge craft directly on the moon, and then lifting off again. This made for a difficult--if not impossible--weight problem. A lone scientist kept arguing for the LOR (lunar-orbit rendezvous). This would solve the weight problem, but the prospect of two spacecraft meeting in lunar orbit seemed daunting at the time. By mid-1962, however, LOR was accepted.

The much-neglected Gemini program is included. The challenges of long-duration flight, and of rendezvous and docking, were mastered. EVAs (spacewalks) proved very exhausting for the participants, until it was realized that these astronauts needed firm footholds and handholds to overcome Newton's third law of motion.

The tragic Apollo 1 fire is seen as one that made the eventual lunar-landing possible by uncovering design flaws that otherwise would've been neglected. Constructing the Saturn 5 rocket was a painstaking process, and the lunar module design encountered constant problems with creeping excessive weight.

The Christmas lunar orbit of Apollo 8 occurred because the lunar module wasn't ready yet, and because intelligence indicated an impending Soviet manned circumlunar flight. Reading from the Book of Genesis was entirely the astronauts' idea.

The huge Soviet N-1 rocket kept exploding soon after launch, firmly dooming the Soviets to second place in the moon race. The historic Apollo 11 landing wasn't straightforward. The desired aiming point had been overshot by 4 miles, and the crew almost ran out of fuel before finding a suitable landing spot.

The documentary is full of good visual aids. One of them, for instance, shows how staging in rockets is used to save weight. One minor error involves the assertion that use of the lunar module engine to propel the entire Apollo ""stack"", during the Apollo 13 abort, had never been tried before. Actually, it had--experimentally on Apollo 9.

The later Apollo missions had the debate on whether the moon is better explored by the traditional pilot-astronaut, or by the newer breed of scientist-astronaut. This became moot. The public lost interest and funding for more Apollo missions was denied. 37 years have now passed since man last walked on the moon...",1245542400,,2577,5.316953316953317
1353664,5,B00004U2MS,"Many documentaries have been made about manned missions to the moon. This is one of the best ones. It includes recent interviews made with astronauts who flew on Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions.  The picture quality is good, development of events that led to the moon flights, the challenges and dangers experienced and the modular structure of the rockets etc. are clearly explained. It is a valuable historical document.",1241827200,,426,5.173913043478261
1353665,1,B00004U2MS,"The use of present-tense verbs to describe events from the past is now commonplace in our post-literate age, especially by historians when talking down to lay people. This script does that, and worse. Consider this excerpt: ""In the 1950s, travel to the Moon is about to become possible because of the rocket. Long used as a weapon, the rocket is the only engine that can be used in a vacuum."" That's not true, and it's the kind of falsehood that sometimes happens when adults over-simplify their subject for children.

Or this one: ""But when future generations look back, they may be surprised to learn why men first went to the Moon, because the ancient dream of exploration had almost nothing to do with what was called Project Apollo."" The script reveals that the true motive was to beat the Russians. How typical of Nova to be so condescending to its audience as to assume we have no understanding of the political context. And the truth is that Apollo had a great deal to do with the dream of exploration.

Or this one: ""In 1968 men first left the Earth for the Moon. Millions of people watched their journey on television, but scarcely a handful knew how it really began."" Oh, so fewer than six people knew how Apollo 8 really began. Nonsense.

Or this one: ""For an astronaut to survive there [in space], he'll need the protection of a spacecraft, or capsule. Even a small capsule will need a huge rocket to put it in space."" Sounds like they are talking to small children.

Or this one: ""Lost between the pioneering flights of Mercury and the lunar triumph of Apollo was the program that found the answers. It was called Gemini. Nearly forgotten today, Gemini was the essential step to the Moon."" Lost and forgotten by whom? I sure didn't lose it, and I'll never forget it. I wish Nova would stop making things up and stick to the truth. In what sense was Gemini more essential than the other steps?

Nova has it that few people know the true motive behind Apollo, or the true beginnings of Apollo 8, or even the existence of the Gemini phase. But Nova knows. Nova always has the answers, and we are children sitting at their feet, grateful for any bits of knowledge they deem to hand down.

The DVD includes the commercials that air at the start of every episode of Nova. I would say that's an indicator of the low esteem Nova has for its audience.",1210118400,,2356,4.531764705882353
1353666,5,B00004U2MS,"This documentary gave me exactly what I was looking for.  Born 15 years after the first Moon landing, the whole space race was old news when I learned about it in school.  I knew the major events, but the details were lost.  I wanted to know more about the young space program and the lunar missions, but I didn't want to sit through the hours and hours that some of the other documentaries offer.

Nova has condensed all the basic facts to create an informative summary.  I gained a new perspective regarding the huge and seemingly impossible achievements.  I don't think anyone could do a better job with so many events in a 2 hour DVD.

For me, the interest peaked during the coverage of Apollo 8 and the launch of Apollo 11, but the later missions don't disappoint.  I really liked the addition of the 3D animations, which help to illustrate aspects of the flights not captured on film.  As for the ""bad"" music mentioned in previous reviews, I hardly noticed.  It's not the best quality, but it's far from obtrusive.

If you've already seen everything about the missions, this DVD may not be for you.  But if you're like me and wish to gain some perspective regarding the era, this is a great place to start.",1201651200,,1212,4.509174311926605
1353667,5,B00004U2MS,"This is one of the best shows on the Apollo program and I have seen and read about everything out there.  It has great interviews and information not found any where else.  This is Nova at its greatest, bravo!",1167955200,2,209,4.333333333333333
1353668,5,B00004U2MS,"I am an avid collector of dvds and books on the early space program thru the Apollo program.  This is the dvd that I watch over and over again.  Very well done, and well worth having.",1166054400,2,183,4.055555555555555
1353669,4,B00004U2MS,". . . and this DVD clearly is a celebration of mankind's most daring, technological achievement to date. If it were possible to have filmed a historically accurate documentary about the building of the great pyramids of Egypt, THIS DVD would still be #1 in my collection.

The history of getting ""To the Moon"" is a fascinating subject and my hat goes off to the first generation of Americans who actually did it! This DVD produced by PBS for NOVA is indeed a celebration of that generation's most outstanding achievement.

Other reviewers have already said most that can be told about ""To the Moon"", and I too am tempted to give five stars. But not quite, as I am quite surprised that such a video could have been produced, supposedly in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the first Moon landing, without including ANY interviews with Neil Armstrong, ""the first Man"" not only go ""to the Moon"", but first to set foot on a celestrial body in outer space. My God, Armstrong is practically a national treasure, a real American space hero, and deserving much more than just a passing mention (via archival footage) in this DVD. I don't recall hearing his famous words, ""That's one small step for Man . . . one giant leap for Mankind"" even being mentioned during the segment on Apollo 11.

So, in some respects this documentary is seemingly lacking in certain aspects of the MOST historical events that should be celebrated on the 30th anniversary on the first landing.

This video is actually much more than that; in fact, many other most publicized Moon missions, Apollo 8, 13, 15 and the last, 17, are covered, plus some of the Mercury and Gemini mission as well. Sadly, there was no mention of the earliest and perhaps most noteable U.S. achievement in space, the first Earth orbital fight, yet all three Gemini space walks were included. How could John Glenn's Mercury flight been skipped over?

Nevertheless, this DVD warrants very high praise for what it does cover, all of which were significant contributions to America's venture into space; Apollo 13's ""successful failure"" notwithstanding. This DVD pretty much tells the whole story, from the late 50s, to the last Apollo mission in December 1972, and does so admirably. There is even rare footage of Eisenhower and Kennedy's earliest contributions to the space race that I have never seen before in any other related documentary film.

I would have awarded it five stars if not for the omissions mentioned. Most other space documentary films have their own set of flaws too. Still, ""To the Moon"" rates right up there with the best of them.

If however, one wishes to truly savor each and every important sequentially historical event of the space program, especially during the Apollo era, and one has 12 hours to do so, I whole heartedly recommend the HBO miniseries ""From The Earth To The Moon"". That miniseries is an exceedingly high quality, TV dramatization, yet historically accurate, and provides vastly more in-depth (and memorable) treatment of this subject matter.

Better yet, invest 14 hours of your time and watch both these history of early manned space flight DVDs, as they certainly are well worth watching.",1157846400,4,3183,4.870609981515711

I thought, at best, this film would give me some neat pictures and videos assembled in ways I'd never seen before.

I was amazed.

There were interviews with people and astronauts I'd never seen before, talking about things I'd only read news releases about. For a real space nerd like me, I was absolutely blown away at how detailed and comprehensive this film was.

Sure, they overlooked Apollo missions 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16 - and I'm sure a lot of people will gripe about that. But the point of this film was to explain the Apollo program in its entirety, which it did, and as such is a fantastic introduction to American space history for everyone, and is a fantastic film even for us know-it-all-space nerds.",1136851200,9,909,4.598765432098766
