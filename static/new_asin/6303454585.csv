653582,4,6303454585,"Prom Night 2 - Hello Mary Lou is about a girl named Mary Lou who was killed at her prom on stage accepting the prom queen award sometime during the 1950's. And then the movie takes place 30 years later and the spirit of Mary Lou has come back from the dead to get revenge, wreak havoc and accept her award as prom queen. She possesses a girl to do so and nothing is going to stop her from getting what she wants.

BORE:
When I was a kid I came home one day and my brother had this movie playing, and I saw a seen that scared me back then, but stuck in my mind all these years. And now finally I have tracked down what that movie was and being a horror buff I must say I this is a pretty decent flick that rekindled me with that scene in my head and i also wasn't disappointed with the rest of the film around it.

Tho it didn't scare me at all this time (nothing does anymore) I still think it's a great horror movie. What's interesting about it is it pays tribute to many of the great horror movies made before it. The most noticeable is the prom at the beginning of the movie that resembles the prom from the movie Carrie. It's not a rip-off; it's a tribute to many, many horror movies.

SUMMARY:
This movie has some great scenes... especially in the locker room *squish*. I love the homage stuff, I like the catch phrases and I think this is certainly a terrific horror movie. The ending could have been better, but overall I'm glad I own this one. It's a shame there is no bonus features at all. I'd love to have heard an audio commentary.

NOTE: this film is not entirely a sequel to Prom Night 1. This movie uses the title as part 2, but it's kind of the same thing that was done for Halloween 3... only this movie doesn't suck!!! So keep in mind it's not a continuation of the first movie, but IMO this is the best Prom Night of them all!",1121126400,13,1845,4.074380165289257

653584,5,6303454585,"This is one of those sequels in name only that is actually better then the original. the school slutMary  Lou who becomes prom queen, catches on fire and dies seeking revenge. twenty years later its time for the prom again and Mary Lou si back as an angry demon wanting revenge.

Prom Night 2 came on TV one night and I figured I would watch it due to people teling me that it was better than the first. Well, it is better than the first but the plot is not that great and the only things that really hold your interest are the few action sequences and what little of the film relates to the first Prom Night.

653586,1,6303454585,"One of Jamie Lee Curtis' first films was a little independent Canadian film by the name of ""Prom Night"".  It was amateurish, but indicative of the times with regard to horror films.  That was 1980.  1987 brings us ""Hello Mary Lou, Prom Night 2"" and the amateurishness of this film just seems sad.  Oddly, the first film and this one both have believable acting.  It's just that in this film, the script seems to be a mish-mash of stuff thrown together in an attempt to cash in on the first film's fame in Ms. Curtis' shadow.
Mary Lou Maloney (in one of those 20 years ago sort of sequences) is a major slut (what this has to do with anything is beyond me) and dies a horrible death when chosen as prom queen and her jilted boyfriend seeks to humiliate her, but instead kills her.  Instead of being a slut, she could surely just have jilted her boyfriend and the story would not have been affected.
1987:  Dishwater blond, crimped long hair:  our heroine is up for Prom Queen.  (I don't know how, because this girl is a mousey little thing).  She's dating the principal's son (who, I think we're to assume is a major stud puppy, but it is never really fleshed out).  She comes from a strict Catholic family.  This is a plot point that seems irrelevant until you realize that the overly religious mother and the pasty faced daughter are a sad attempt to have us think of ""Carrie"". In fact, there are several references to ""Carrie"" and ""The Exorcist.""  One boy repeatedly refers to a girl as being ""possessed,"" acting like ""Linda Blair,"" and several other Exorcist references.  It is a real groaner, he is killed and his head turned around croaking out a phrase similar to what Linda Blair's character did in the Exorcist.
This film moves slow, folks.  The story it tells in almost two hours could have been told in 45 minutes.  And it's stupid.
. ...
So, while this film isn't scary - you should be very afraid of it - at least seeing it.",1026172800,3,1936,4.441926345609065

The quality isn't great - but it beats the VHS bootleg I've had all these years.  We need a proper mastering on Blu.

Mary Lou is killed in the 60s while being crowned Prom Queen by a tragic prank gone wrong (don't worry, there is no more Carrie in there).  Fast forward and her boyfriend is the town priest and her OTHER boyfriend is the principal of the school she died in.  Mary Lou's spirit is released from captivity and seeks fun and revenge.

While there are definitely some laughs in here - there is plenty of killing and mayhem.  It is a cut above the horror you're going to see today.  Pick it up.",1447977600,,728,4.262773722627737
653737,4,6303454585,"Confessions of a bad girl, it's 1957 and prom night.  Poor unlucky Mary Lou plays fast and loose one time too many and betrays the wrong boy.  Soon, an almost harmless prank sets Mary Lou on fire.  As she goes up in smoke, she casts a vengeful eye on the firebug who ruined her party dress.  More importantly, she missed being crowned the prom queen!!!  Years later, in time for another prom, as bad plotting would have it, evil Mary Lou is inadvertently unleashed on the unsuspecting members of Hamilton High.  Mary Lou's first victim is a pregnant girl with bad hair who's hung on a light fixture then flung out a window.  Naturally, it's deemed a suicide (although how someone who's hung themselves DEAD, manages to undo the cape that did them in, then jumps their dead body through a window....).  Soon, Mary Lou starts bedeviling a good girl (Wendy Lyon as Vicki Carpenter) with hallucinations.  She quickly possesses Vicki and starts to wreck havoc on anyone who gets in her way.  No one seems to notice any of this until it's far too late.

Moderately better than the unrelated first film in this series, it still suffers from having borrowed too heavily from too many other films.  Originally titled The Haunting of Hamilton High (Alliance Films renamed it to cash in on the success of Prom Night).",1446508800,,1306,4.655021834061135

This one was also good, an R rated form of Poltergeist on Prom Night, not a bad comparison, imo. This film sets the stage for Mary Lou's backstory, and the origins of her revenge. The special effects aren't bad for their time, I do want to see the one with J. L. Curtis, have for a long time. Definately another stand alone film, and name only sequel, and this one works, but unlike some, I also enjoyed Halloween 3, because it was a stand alone film film as well. Yes, I know, I liked John Carpenter and Rob Zombie's take on Michael Myers, but that third part didn't bother me either.

653745,5,6303454585,"Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II surprised me in how graphic and borderline poltergeist-like it was at times!  I wasn't expecting either of these things and actually thought it would focus on cheap ""teens running around and screaming like mad while failing to deliver with the deaths"" but considering the movie came out in 1987 I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.  Those happen to be the glory years of horror films in my opinion.  The violent deaths were usually unpredictable and seemed to have more emotion associated with them which is something I've never really thought about until now.  That's exactly what's missing in today's horrors- oh sure the teenagers cry and feel scared, but they're never authentically pleasing like in this movie for example.  This is because of rushed character development and lack of atmosphere in many of today's horrors.

A good example of authenticity is the lengthy scene showing a girl crying while Wendy Lyon's naked possessed character chases her around in a locker room.  The poor girl actually cries which makes her rather inventive (and gruesome!) death more meaningful and sadder.  Maybe it's sadistic on my part to enjoy these particular moments but come on, it makes the film more hard-hitting and memorable right?  When a girl looks like she's really upset, it makes the scene better.  Shame on me!

Anyway the movie is about a prom queen who gets caught on fire after a prank goes horribly wrong by her ex-boyfriend.  To be fair, the prank was probably intended to be pretty extreme anyway since we're dealing with fire here- the girl cheated on the poor guy and basically stood him up surrounded by their classmates at the dance thus embarrassing him/crushing his dreams.  You'd want revenge too!  Whatever the intention of the prank isn't clear but what IS clear is that this scene leads into a really disturbing part a moment later showing the girl not only catching on fire rather believably might I add, but even turning to LOOK up at the boyfriend.  This means he gets to spend his whole life (as a deeply concerned principal and father) remembering the tragic day his very own ex-girlfriend looked into his eyes while burning to death.

After this... the deceased girl comes back to haunt the school many years later after one curious girl accidentally activates her I guess you could say, and specifically this evil spirit takes over the female classmate character of Wendy Lyon.  Wendy stops being a nice little girl!  The character development is really solid overall regardless who we're discussing however.  You really want to see Wendy's stuck-up mother get what she deserves since she apparently doesn't understand how to let loose and have fun once in a while (and on a side note, I actually often sit and wonder what these people were like when they were younger and what made them turn so angry, heh) and you can't wait to see what kind of disturbing deaths are awaiting these teens!  How about a girl hanging herself off a ceiling light when the invisible spirit reveals itself inside the closet of a school?  Ah man, the girls weight was *almost* heavy enough to cause the light to collapse and spare her life too.  However given the surprisingly persistent means of the spirit, I imagine the girl was going to die soon and graphically anyway.  Loved how the evil spirit did a little finishing touch- threw the dead girls butt outside the window to make it look like a suicide, lol.

The death where a girl gets squashed when a row of lockers close in on her so you see blood oozing is absolutely *awesome* but let's be honest, many of us guys -knowing how our brains fall in the gutter whenever a naked lady appears *points naughty finger at you in disapproval and shame* we were mostly distracted with the full nudity display of Wendy Lyon walking around.  Admit it!  Okay I'll admit it.  However now that I got all that nudity out of my system, I can appreciate the extremely uncomfortable way that poor girl got smashed.  And the boy who got electrocuted through a computer?  Okay that one was entirely for comical reasons because it wasn't very scary, haha.

Overall, tremendous horror.  WAY better than I went in expecting.",1415318400,,4197,4.779472954230235

When you wake a vengeful spirit and give her the opportunity at a second chance to attend the prom where she previously died you simply can't expect that she'll let anything get in her way...and it doesn't.",1382054400,,659,4.945945945945946
653783,4,6303454585,"Marylou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) is a beautiful, popular, and generically bitchy girl who ends up dying a horrible death after being nominated prom queen in 1957. What fate. The movie jumps ahead thirty years, to show us that her prom date Bill Nordham is a principle and another man who had the hots for Marylou is the past has now become a priest of all things. A trunk in the school is opened, unleashing the rebellious spirit of Marylou. She slowly takes over the body of a young and uptight woman, Vicki, before another prom night and crown rolls around. Along the way she gets her taste of revenge by killing others just for the heck of it.
The plot, of course, isn't the point. Body count and fun times are. The acting isn't superb but it's passable and many of the characters have an undeniable sort of charm about them.

The film is obviously low budget but the plot works to accomplish what it set out to do: be a perfect popcorn movie that screams the title ""guilty pleasure."" Something about this film is addictive. Because, while the events are, well...basically stupid, they remained interesting.

The deaths weren't even that good by slasher standards, unless you count the great ""locker squish"", but that's not what won me over. There was a great fun chemistry going down all the way through and I left this one feeling about as chipper as a girl recently asked to the prom.

On a more deeper level, Vicki is in a way more the main character here. You have a girl basically buried beneath the disapproving face of her mother, the strictness of their religion, and trying to be the popular girl in school. She gets ridiculed by some of her peers without classifying as a nerd (although to me her boyfriend may as well be wearing triple thick glasses and spouting pocket protectors), and her mother is about as scary as the spirit of Mary Lou herself. After being drawn to the trunk and research on the past prom queen who died, she gets more than she bargained for but, through Mary Lou's possession, also finally stands up to her bitchy mother, has a near lesbian scene, becomes more friendly with her boyfriend (my guess is they never did much beforehand), and lets her stand up more to her enemies. While this is all accomplished in ""horror fun"" and not in the best way to achieve the end results, maybe there's a message somewhere in here?

Not too much stands out on the acting, although Lisa Schrage as Mary Lou seems made for the part. Vicki (Wendy Lyon) had this look about her that fit, and her acting was stiff but blended in somehow. I remember seeing this years back and wondering how she did her hair in a particular scene. *ends strange side note* We have other good actors, such as Michael Ironside, but all of this are completely off. Whether it's intentional or not, it fits into the general theme of this movie.

Of course there are a multitude of plot holes. I find it hard to believe the man who accidently killed her at the prom would then go on to become the principal there, for instance. But these things can always be overlooked when it comes to offerings like Prom Night 2.

While this B movie may not be the best of the lot, it still can stand proud against some of the stinkers out there. The script isn't so foul it gives only migraines, the acting isn't so low it's reduced to high school play levels, and the humor in it is actually funny in a cute, morbid way.

Don't rent it expected a sequel to the original prom night, or something classy - rent it expecting pure and simple old school slasher fun, and that's what you'll get.",1379635200,,3574,4.480798771121352

Wendy Lyon plays a high school girl who is haunted by the ghost of Mary Lou which occupies the costume closet underneath the Great Hall. There are a lot of bad-tempered jealous characters in this movie, who are fuelled by an overdose of Heineken into unspeakable violence, not rivers of blood though because this is a very controlled SFX team. Locations are various, it's not just the school, and visually there is more than just a touch of the original Omen film.

Michael Ironside rolls through the film straight-faced almost as if he can't wait to cash that paycheck. It's left up to the teens, then, to carry the film. Unfortunately they all appear to be in their mid-20s and, especially in the case of the main character, require much stretching of the imagination to fit the part.

There's some undeniable weirdness at hand (especially concerning two gals in a shower) but the film succeeds at creating its own atmosphere independently of the first film. There are some issues with originality at times, but the film is never boring and doesn't quite turn out the way you expect it to. Also, the `50s nostalgia is a nice touch and helps set the film aside from other horror sequels in the `80s.

Unfortunately, it caught Mary Lou's dress on fire and she died tragically burning up so fast no one could even approach her to try to put the flames out and save her.

653886,4,6303454585,"Hello Mary Lou is a classic rock song originally sung by Ricky Nelson and covered by such classic bands as Queen, CCR, and Led Zeppelin. I love the song and it's not the reason why I bought this dvd. I saw a very, very brief clip of this film over ten years ago and i've always wanted to get it once I learned it was out on dvd.

Mary Lou confesses to her priest that she likes sex and has done alot of guys in her school and craves her name in the confessional saying call for a good time. We cut to prom and she went with her current boyfriend but he is told they broke up. He denies it and catches her cheating on him, apparently the only reason why she dates him is because he treats her right and his father is rich. He accidentally sets Mary Lou on fire and everyone stares, weren't there any fire extinguishers back then? We cut to thirty years later and the boyfriend is the current principal of the school. Mary Lou comes back, enters the body of a girl, and wreaks havoc on peopke that did her wrong. The movie is not really gory and there is some cheap looking effects. The end of the movie was a typical ending to a horror film, leaving room for the next part.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie even though the story was not always clear or maybe I didn't pay to much attention to it. I don't understand why they could not use the song Hello Mary Lou in the film. It should have been public access by the time the film was released and would have been the perfect way to end the movie.",1252627200,,1494,4.09556313993174
653935,4,6303454585,"On Hamilton high's prom night 1957, Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) was killed during a vengeful prank gone horribly wrong. Burned alive in front of the entire senior class, Mary Lou stares out at them w/ eyes full of hate. Fast-forward 30 years, and it's prom season again. This time, Mary Lou will finally have her vengeance. PROM NIGHT 2 is one of those movies I put off watching for years, figuring it would stink. I also wanted Jamie Lee Curtis to be in it (yes, I love her). Well, I just watched it and must say that it stands on it's own as an 80s classic. PN2 includes ghosts, possession, telekinetic powers, and enough supernatural murder and mayhem to please any horror enthusiast. Oh yeah, and there's some gratuitous (though always welcome) nudity as well. Plus, creep-fest icon, Michael Ironside (Scanners, Visiting Hours, Starship Troopers, Total Recall, etc.) is the Hamilton High principal who knew Mary Lou all too well!! With nods to CARRIE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and others, PR2 is a hoot! Watch for the PC electrocution, death-by-neon-lightning-bolt, and girl-turned-into-hamburger-in-a-locker sequences! Also, this movie is like a late 80s fashion disaster show. Check out the tall, stiff hair and ""hip"" clothing for added terror! A must-see...",1235692800,5,1270,5.052380952380952

653939,4,6303454585,"Prom Night II is not exactly a direct sequel to Prom Night I. However I did not like any of the other Prom Night movies, except for this one, and maybe the 3rd one.

As said, it's not a direct sequel, usually when horror movies are a success and they use the name to make another one in hopes the name alone can sell it, they usually get bashed by reviews and dismissed as cheap B-grade movies.

Hello Mary-Lou is not that case. This movie is one people can truly say it's a sequel better then the original.

The movie is about a woman named Mary Lou who is a tramp. Her boyfriend she goes to the prom with becomes very unhappy when he finds she will not do it with him, but he finds her going all the way with someone else backstage of the prom.

Mary-Lou falls victim to a death that pays homage to ""Carrie"". She is burned in a fire and dies. Years later she returns to the school and possesses a young girl to seek revenge on those who killed her, and to finally enjoy her prom queen status, all while the typical things like people finding out and running around after her trying to stop it all.

If anyone tells you this movie is a rip off of Carrie and a few other horror movies, they need to know that, this movie is not a rip off. It was paying homage to classic horror films. It was a collection of different horror flicks rolled into one for this story.

Looking at it now, it's not the worlds greatest horror movie, but it's cool, it's funny and very enjoyable. Tho I first remember coming home one day when I was very young and my older brother was watching this, and the locker room scene scared the hell out of me as a kid, which is why I wanted to see it again a few years back ... and second time around, it was a great movie, and fun.

There is combination available on DVD for Prom Night 2 & 3. There about the only P.N movies I would recommend. 1 & 4 where pretty boring in my opinion.",1216080000,,1904,4.088471849865952
653940,4,6303454585,Glad that now that the remake of the original Prom Night is in theatres that they finally decided to release Prom Night 2 to DVD. It was always one of my favorite Prom night stories with it super natural aspect of a dead prom queen possessing a high school girl and trying to live the dream of being queen she was denied when she died in the school gym fire in 1950s. A lot better concept than a mere serial killer. My only problem is the same as with most 1980s horror movies. That is the DVD box art. I find it weird that 1980s had the most fantastic VHS box cover art and often some of the worst DVD box cover art.,1215475200,15,617,4.024390243902439

653942,3,6303454585,"First, lets get this out of the way, Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2 is not a sequal to Prom Night. It stands alone as its own movie and on top of that is much better than the original Prom Night and the new Prom Night. The only thing it has in common with Prom Night is the fact it takes place at Hamilton High. This 1987 supernatual horror/thriller from director Bruce Pittman got limted realese in the late 80's and was really slept on by most people. It has a solid story and the acting wasn't bad either. On top of that it has Sci-Fi legend Michael Ironside ""Scanners"" in one of the main roles as Billy Nordham, Mary Lou's jeoulous ex-boyfreind. This movie really takes place during two seperate times. The movie starts out in 1957 at the Hamilton High prom. A younger Billy Nordham's date for the prom is Mary Lou, played perfectly by Lisa Schrage. Billy goes to get Mary Lou a drink and then comes back to find her with another guy getting it on behind closed doors. Mary Lou is chosen Prom Queen shortly after. Billy,out of a fit of jeoulousy decides to get back at Mary Lou right before she is to be crowned by climbing the rafters an throwing a giant stink bomb behind her. Well, poor billy should have cut the fuse because it's so long the it catches her gown on  fire and see burns to death in front of the entire senoir class.
  Thirty years later enter Viki Carpenter, this years font runner for prom queen. Vicki( played by Wendy Loyon) is a shy, innocent girl who's going out with Craig,the son of the principal of Hamilton High, who happens to be an older Billy Nordham(Michael Ironside). This to me is one of the only flaws in the story. How could somebody who wittness something so horrific decide to become principal of that same school? Anyway, when Vicki finds and old dress for the prom trouble begins. Mary Lou's spirit slowly begins to possess Vicki's body and she only has one thing on her mind,REVENGE!
  This Movie is alot of fun. It takes alot of old concepts (Exorcist,Carrie) and mixes them up very well. On the scare factor I can only give it a 6 out of 10. But on the fun factor I give it a 8 which brings my total rating to a 3.5 stars out of five. I recommend this movie for anyone who's looking for a fun night at home or happened to miss their prom night and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, AH,AH,AH,AH,AHHHH!!!",1213142400,4,2356,4.309255079006772
653943,5,6303454585,"""NO F*****G WINGS!"".....this is just one line from this movie, which is by far, in my collection as one of the creepiest movies I own. I have seen this movie countless times and I think it was very well done in an era when these kinds of movies ran rampant.............the 80's, I don't know if it would stand up against some of the ones if it were made today the same way but it still gives me chills.

Mary Lou Maloney was Prom Queen of the 1957 prom but unfortunately, a jealous boyfriend decided to play a joke on her a throw a stink bomb on stage from the rafters and ruin the proceedings, but as luck would have it, he ruined a lot more than that, he ruined her dress, her hair, her makeup and pretty much any chance for a life after High School because the stink bomb ignites the dress and turns her into a toasted Marshmallow...........BUT HEY, what kind of a movie would it be if it ended there, eh?.................CIRCA: 1987, 30 years later and strange things are happening at this school and most of them to poor Vicki Carpenter, who is running for Prom Queen, unfortunately for Vicki, someone else wants the crown who missed it by a stink's breath, MARY LOU and nothing is going to stand in her way......or NOBODY so, she does what any self respecting life entity does in a movie like this...she takes over Vicki's body and the fun starts and so does the body count.

Hey, this movie is a slam dunk for anyone's collection who likes horror, it stars great Character actor Michael Ironside, from the TV Mini-series ""V"" and movies like THE NEXT KARATE KID.",1210032000,,1568,4.440972222222222

I haven't been able to see this movie for years and on occasion would go on-line to see if there was a decent version and finally now, MGM has done the movie justice with this DVD version.

It's a fun horror flick from the 80s with decent acting and good cinematography. You can't say that about a lot of recent horror movies lately. I have a soft spot for this movie.

653995,4,6303454585,"Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is a sequel by name only; the only connection between this and the first Prom Night is the high school Hamilton High. Other than that this is a stand-alone movie with nothing from the original carrying over. I suppose that's a good thing; the original Prom Night wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but it's not very good either. The final 30-minutes were fairly decent, but not enough to really salvage it. Prom Night II on the other hand is a far better movie, but not without its fair share of flaws.

There might be more going against Prom Night II rather than for it; there is a low body count, very little in the way of the red stuff, and very little suspense and tension. The basic premise of Prom Night II is a little bit of Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Exorcist. And it also rips off, or you can say homage if you like to other horror movies of the 70s and 80s. But yet despite all these flaws there is just something so much fun about Prom Night II. Despite all those flaws it's damn entertaining.

Writer Ron Oliver delivers the basic script for this kind of movie and borrows elements from other films, but he manages to work them in well and they don't feel out of place. Bottom line is the script won't win any awards, but it works out rather well. It's an entertaining script. It's not bad and it's not good, but again entertaining. Ron Oliver may not go down as one of the horror genres better writers, but his script mostly gets the job done.

Director Bruce Pittman does a fairly good job at keeping the pace moving along nicely, there are a few spots where the pacing does lag, but overall there aren't too many slow moments due to the cheese factor. Most of the deaths are in the final 30-minutes or so, and that does hurt a little bit, but again Bruce Pittman keeps the pace mostly moving and with all the cheesy moments prior you won't lose interest. Prom Night II borderlines seriousness and camp, which was the point; though there are a couple of scenes I wasn't sure if they were meant to be serious or campy and that is the major flaw with the directing. There are certain scenes you know were meant to be campy, but like I said there were a couple that I wasn't quite sure.

Prom Night II could have used a little bit of editing though like I said there are moments where the pace might lag a bit, but the cheese factor helps it from becoming boring. Prom Night II runs at about 97-minutes and could have maybe been edited down to the 90-minute mark, but the movie doesn't get too boring, but a little bit of editing could have greatly helped the pace.

Prom Night II isn't without some bizarre moments one of them being when Vicki played by Wendy Lyon is possessed by Mary Lou she begins to make out with her father played by Wendell Smith. The creepy thing is the father was sort of into it. In fairness Vicki was possessed, but the father wasn't; gotta love movies with the incest theme.

The cast was pretty good as well; Lisa Schrage as Mary Lou Maloney was excellent despite her limited screen time; Most of the time Mary Lou is either doing a haunting and we don't see her or possesses the body of Vicki. Wendy Lyon is highly likeable as the heroine and when possessed by Mary Lou she's really fun as the villain. Michael Ironside also stars and delivers a mostly entertaining performance. The rest of the cast play their roles they way they were meant to. Like I stated before Prom Night II borderlines seriousness and camp and the performances fit the movie.

Overall despite the flaws Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is an effective movie. While the suspense and tension does lack it's very entertaining in a way only an 80s horror flick can be. Though at least there is some full frontal nudity from Wendy Lyon. You rarely see that in movies these days due to the PC police. For a low budget the F/X weren't too bad. After this the Mary Lou plot would continue in Prom Night III and the 4th would go off in a different direction, but go back to the slasher elements of the first one. Of all the Prom Night flicks this is really the only one worth watching. Despite the flaws it manages to entertain and when all is said and done isn't that all that matters?",1207353600,4,4234,4.338383838383838
653996,4,6303454585,"I hadn't seen this in years and recently purchased it again on a great looking new DVD by MGM. There was also a sticker on the case that said ""On DVD for the First Time!"" The picture and sound were both crystal clear. No special features but that is to be expected. It seems the soundtrack is still in tact as well including Ricky Nelson's Hello Mary Lou. Sometimes it is hard licensing music onto old films due to legal/money/rights issues (the replaced music for the 2004 DVD of Happy Birthday to Me comes to mind). I'm assuming this is being re-released to coincide with the 2008 remake of Prom Night due out in theatres next week. I really enjoyed the first Prom Night with Jaime Lee Curtis. People should note that this film has nothing to do with the first one and that's not necessarily a bad thing although the same high school name is used. Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is actually a very entertaining, fun horror flick with some comedic touches thrown in. It is sort of a cross between Carrie and The Exorcist. We open with the 1957 prom queen winner Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) who goes up in a barrell of flames due to her jilted boyfriend being left behind for another guy. Fast forward 30 years later and Vickie Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) has been nominated prom queen. She is also dating the principal's son whose father just happens to be the guy responsible for Mary Lou's death. Suddenly, Mary Lou's unrested spirit is released and she is burning mad! (no pun intended) Vickie begins acting stranger by the day. She is saying things she doesn't normally say. She begins doing things she doesn't nomally do. She even comes to school dressed in clothes fit for 1957. What could be happening? If you are thinking Mary Lou is starting to possess Vickie's body to get revenge on those who wronged her or who stand in her way of becoming the 1987 prom queen, you would be right. There are many enjoyable moments to savor for those who don't mind taking a break from serious horror. There is also some very smart and witty dialogue, and the actors all did a nice job.

653999,5,6303454585,"Released 7 (!!!) years after the original Prom Night, ""Hello Mary-Lou"" is a very well made film and (in my opinion) the last GOOD Prom Night movie (yes, I'm counting the 2008 remake 'cause it's gonna suck).  Though it doesn't directly relate to the first Prom Night, it DOES take place at the same high school ""Hamilton High"" (same as the other two movies in the series).
  This film is awesome because:

  The Makers of this film took their time, and set a very good tone w/ pacing, and how they set up the shots.  The High School and Church is always looming over the characters (repeated in Prom Night 3/4).  The designs of the school, Prom and the ""hell school"" that Vicky sees is amazing.  I remember being scared to death when I was little of the dead lunch lady scooping out soup w/ worms in it.  Gross!

  The acting is very real.  Nobody was overdramatic and everybody seemed to really feel like high school students.  Maybe the Priest was a bit much...but I think he was supposed to be a bit dramatic.
  Wendy Lyon who plays Vicky the unfortunate student who becomes posessed by Mary Lou is one of my all-time favorite horror heroines.  Though she doesn't really do much she played Vicky perfectly.  Though I don't believe her as Prom Queen once she starts loosing it you really start to feel for Vicky.  She was able to balance the line of sane/insane/scared/evil....once she's posessed Wendy Lyon is down right creepy.

  The death scenes are okay....I've seen better.  But my favorite is obviously the locker sequence.  That blood oozing out is perfect and I like that what u don't see is just as gross.  When Mary-Lou bursts out of Vicky at the prom I thought that was really scary (more so when I was little).  Although in one shot you can see the line of the mask she's wearing...I even remember noticing that when I was 11!!!

  People say that this film has nothing to do w/ the Original.....I beg to differ.  Although there's no masked killer, and doesn't involve any of the characters from the original...it still happened at Hamilton High and I like to think that Prom Night and Prom Night 2 exist in the same timeline.  We saw Hamilton High in 1980....Mary Lou burned in 1957....and Prom Night 4 opens up on Prom Night 1957, but we don't see the queen ceremony....so all four movies could have happened in one time-line.  We just didn't hear about Mary-Lou in the first film, and Prom Night 4 didn't even take place at the prom.  Although, Part 4 said ""here's to Jamie Lee Curtis""...so maybe Prom Night 4 happens in real life.  Who knows.  Not to mention they were all produced by the same Peter Simpson.

  Back to this film, it also tackles a very serious teen subject.  Pregnancy.  One of the characters becomes pregnant by (I'm assuming) some popular jock who refuses to call her back.  She dies like, 5 min. later so it's insignificant but still....for them to slip that in a horror movie was pretty intersting.  Perhaps trying to tell teens they weren't alone.

  If you're looking for a good scary movie that takes itself a little seriously but doesn't dumb down the main characters this is for you!!  Though it's slow on the gore 'till the middle/end the setup is worth it.  And there's many elements of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" (my fav) which makes it more that just a simple slasher which is what Prom Night 1 was.  Even if you didn't like the first Prom Night check this one out.  I don't think you'll be dissapointed.",1200528000,,3454,4.536585365853658

Mary Lou has returned to the world. -summary

The only thing Prom Night 2 (1987) has in common with the original Prom Night (1980) that starred Jamie Lee Curtis is the name, and quite frankly, that's just not a bad thing at least in my case. The original movie was a poorly paced, excuse of a slasher that wasn't only cheap with the slashes, but the end results really didn't deliver at all. Now this movie isn't THAT much of an improvement though, however, I can manage to remain focused and not worry about the Z-monster bombarding me with sleep-inducing hay-makers. Directed by Bruce Pittman, Prom Night 2 is somewhat entertaining despite how heavily it apes from other horror films in the same class.

For starters, this movie uses a supernatural theme as it borrows heavily from both A Nightmare on Elm Street and Carrie. It doesn't reach anywhere near the same level of greatness as either film mainly because it takes itself far less seriously; this isn't exactly a flaw to me, since it handles certain elements well enough plus you can tell through various homages its aim was low brow entertainment. The plot follows Vicki whom finds herself suffering from some type of hallucinations with Mary Lou at the center of it all. Her everyday life flips to a darker version and she finds herself quite possibly falling deeper into insanity. During this time, Mary Lou is working her way towards a possession.

If I'll say anything was done well it was developing Vicki's character by making her out to be somewhat sympathetic. The world doing cartwheels in one's face is more than enough to drive anyone insane, but combine that with an overly religious and domineering mother, well, it creates a nice recipe for screwed up young person. I liked her character, especially as she breaks away from the innocent type and lashes out due to her mood swings. The movie works its creep factor decent enough through the hallucinations and other supernatural occurrences. Unfortunately, this is about all it does well.

The film has a low death count, and I really don't have a problem with this in horror flicks as long as the deaths deliver in being something memorable, or if the film does a great job handling its atmosphere. Prom Night 2 comes up short in both of those areas (more the former); with the exception of one cool death, the rest comes off quite lame with some very weak gore. Mary Lou isn't exactly a bad horror villain, if anything, she is by far the least believable. It's completely unclear what made her into such a powerful ghoul in the first place. I get what she came back for and why she was so angry, still though, there should have been an attempt to raise her story above the level of nonsensical. It feels too much like things are happening just because. I will also point out that the events leading to the ending were quite corny, and it felt like the creative team just started getting high when filming that portion.

I thought the acting was decent enough with Michael Ironside turning in a good enough performance, along with Judy Mahbey as Vicki's mother. She definitely effected my feelings towards her character and things like that will always be a plus for me. Another huge plus is definitely the female nudity, I mean wow, Wendy Lyon has one hot bod with the smoothest looking butt cheeks. She's practically a goddess to me. There was also some effort into the set pieces in regards to the dream segments. They were decent in providing that otherworldly feel.

In closing, Prom Night 2 isn't a movie that I totally dislike, but I do like it more than the original due to having slightly better deaths, better pacing and a character I actually liked. I can watch it around Halloween time or if someone comes through and it grabs their interest. It's very far from a truly bad movie. I recommend this as a rental only if you're looking for something you don't have to put much thought into.

Pros: Watchable at the very least

Cons: Issues with story elements, weak death scenes and gore for most part",1451347200,,4393,4.659354838709677
