8031906,4,B0002U39E2,"Nice set of screen versions of 3 O'Henry's stories illustrating different facets of his style: 1 dramatic (""The Roads we Take"")+ 1 slightly melancholy humor (""Makes the Whole World Kin"")+ 1 eccentric (""The Ransom of Red Chief""). Excellent work of a few comedy stars of the 60s - 70s. The example of early work of the most talented Soviet comedy director Leonid Gaidai. The only thing I wish the disc had - English subtitles, though the screen versions are so detailed that one can enjoy them simply right after reading the stories themselves.",1243036800,,542,4.838709677419355
