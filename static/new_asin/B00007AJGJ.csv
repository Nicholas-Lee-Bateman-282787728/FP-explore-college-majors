1805382,4,B00007AJGJ,"I thought White Light, Countdown to Destruction, To the Tenth Power and Forever Red were pretty good choices. I didn't agree much with Trakeena's Revenge though, it wasn't that great of an episode. What about Green w/ Evil, anything from Zeo or Turbo. Also, I was disappointed there were no extra features like outtakes etc. I hope DVD sets for each season are put out.",1051747200,3,369,4.6923076923076925
1805383,3,B00007AJGJ,"Well, I like the episodes that they have chosen but, they should have given the DvD more special features! Like maybe trivia games or actor profiles and even behind the creating of the power Rangers. I thought it was totally awesome to see all the Red Rangers again. Tommy is the coolest to have seen and also Jason the original Red Ranger. I hope make a series Dvd for the Power Rangers because I am a die hard fan and have watched since the beginning. Other wise the Dvd is cool it just needs more special features and I know that could have done better! So we will just have to wait and see what they come up with next! I wish they also could have had an all power ranger reunion show maybe they will after this next season!",1049760000,,727,4.2

EPISODE REVIEWS
1) Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: White Light part 1 & 2 - These episodes occured in the middle of season 2 and were also two of the final real appearences by 3 of the original Rangers (Jason, Zack, & Trini). With the fan-favorite Green Ranger no longer a part of the series, the show introduced the White Ranger and these episodes feature the return of ""the legendary"" Tommy. Good episodes to watch, but I personally would have prefered something involving the Green Ranger.
2) Power Rangers in Space: Countdown to Destruction part 1 & 2 - This was the season finale for ""In Space"" and had a much more serious tone to it than the usual PR episodes. This was certainly the end of an era as we saw the final appearences from many old characters. Everyone from Rita Repulsa to the Gold Ranger to Zordon made final appearences in these episodes. These certainly deserve to be on DVD.
3) Power Rangers Lost Galaxy: To the Tenth Power - This was truly the first team-up special involving 2 different Power Ranger teams. The Psycho Rangers from ""In Space"" return and the Galaxy Rangers unite with the Space Rangers to fend them off. At the time of airing, it was certainly a treat to see Andros and the others back on screen. This was a great episode and the arrival of the Space Rangers accompanied by their old theme music makes the scene ever better. Kudos!
4) Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue: Trakeena's Revenge part 1 & 2 - This was the team-up episode between the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers and the Galaxy Rangers. For the most part, Lightspeed was considered one of the weaker PR series, but these episodes are certainly entertaining.
5) Power Rangers Wild Force: Forever Red - This was the 10th Anniversary special of Power Rangers and featured the Red Rangers of all the previous series. Jason (MMPR), Tommy (Zeo), TJ (Turbo), Andros (Space), Leo (Lost Galaxy), Carter (Lightspeed), Wes & Eric (Time Force), and Cole (Wild Force) all unite to stop the return of the Machine Empire. Very few people have anything negative to say about this episode. It was a wonderful nod to 10 years of history and certainly deserves its place on this DVD collection.
PACKAGING
Much to my disappointment, it seems as though no real thought was put into the creation of this DVD. It seems more like a gimme to the fans from a company that didn't really care. There are several spelling errors on the back of the box. No extras were added to the DVD, but I won't count that against them since that's what they are suppose to be: Extras. One of the most disappointing aspects of the DVD is the lack of chapters in the episodes. If you want to see the White Ranger reveal his identity, you have to fast forward through most of two episodes to get there.
OVERALL
I can't complain too much since I'm just glad to see a new Power Rangers DVD. I was sad to see no Time Force episodes added to the disc since it is my personal favorite series. My hope is that this is merely a test product and we shall see more episodes released on DVD soon. Lets see some Season Box Sets!",1049587200,7,3286,4.543001686340641
1805385,3,B00007AJGJ,"Ok, the following episodes of Power Rangers are on this DVD:-
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers ""White Light(Parts 1 & 2)""
Power Rangers in Space ""Countdown to Destruction(Parts 1 & 2)""
Power Rangers Lost Galaxy ""To The Tenth Power""
Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue ""Trakeena's Revenge(Parts 1 & 2)""
Power Rangers Wild Force ""Forever Red""
Pretty disappointing selection. First of all I think they could have had more episodes with this package. Here's what I think of what they have chosen-
White Light (Parts 1 & 2)- When this episode came out it was a major episode because it introduced the White Ranger so it is quite understandable that it would be chosen for this selection.
Countdown To Destruction (Parts 1 & 2)- Simply the main reason to buy this DVD. It is the best two Power Rangers episodes ever made. It is quite epic in scope and featured the pivotal destruction of Zordon who originated the Power Rangers.
To The Tenth Power- Great choice again and one of the best crossover events in Power Rangers.
Trakeena's Revenge (Parts 1 & 2)- Lightspeed Rescue was probably the weakest Power Rangers series, and this is one of the best episodes of that series. Nice to see a crossover with the Lost Galaxy Power Rangers but it just doesn't live up to its potential. Still, not a bad choice.
Forever Red- The amazing episode that featured various Red Rangers teaming up together.
Now as you can see I've pretty much complimented every episode on the DVD. But my problem isn't with the episodes they have, it's with what they don't have. There also should have been an episode from each series- where are Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Time Force? Another plus would have been to have the very first episode of Ninja Storm. They call this the Best of the Power Rangers, yet they forget to include some of the best episodes such as Ninja Quest (Parts 1, 2, 3 & 4) from Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, as well as the final four episodes of Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and the opening and final episodes of Power Rangers Time Force. That's why I'm disappointed with this DVD.
It probably won't happen, but here's hoping they have a volume 2, or start to bring out the entire series in boxsets.",1046131200,30,2191,4.664082687338501
1805386,5,B00007AJGJ,"I'm so excited that a DVD of the episodes of Power Rangers is coming out. FINALLY!! I have watched PR ever since it first aired in 1993,and I have loved it ever since!

1805402,4,B00007AJGJ,"The Power Rangers franchise is, arguably, the most successful series that has come from Americanised adaptations of Japanese tokusatsu.  Since 1993, Haim Saban has been translating the Japanese superhero series of Super Sentai for an American audience that started with the worldwide phenomenon 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers', and is still going strong to this day.  The company and series has seen its highs and lows, with Buena Vista/Disney taking over production in the early 00's, to Saban Brands buying the company back quite recently in order to give the franchise a well needed turn-around with its nineteenth and twentieth seasons of 'Power Rangers (Super) Samurai'.  Now celebrating its twentieth anniversary, currently airing 'Power Rangers Megaforce' with references to past seasons and rangers, the franchise has definitely reached its high point and is a true success story of intercultural media translation.
This 2003 VHS and DVD release, containing five fan-picked episodes via online voting, was distributed during the period when Saban Entertainment and Disney's Buena Vista division jointly held the rights to the Power Rangers franchise, including its home video library.  There has been some criticism amongst fans regarding the popularity and suitability of the episodes that were picked for inclusion on this release, stating that there are other, more memorable episodes that were not included.  I, however, was happy at the time, just to see a compilation of earlier episodes being released on DVD, digitally mastered, for the first time; plus I believe that the chosen episodes indeed do have merit within the history of the Power Rangers universe, even though I do have my personal favourites that were not included on this release.

The episodes that are included within this compilation are as follows:
* 'White Light' - the two-part second season saga of 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' that marked the debut of the White Ranger (the first and only Dairanger costume to be used within the series).  It also sparked the return of Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver to the main cast listing, providing him with a very loyal fan-base and a lifelong career as one of the greatest veteran rangers of all time.
* 'Countdown to Distraction' - the climactic two-part finale to 'Power Rangers in Space' that marked the end of the original line-up of changing cast members during the Zordon-era and the beginning of self-contained series thereafter.  This was definitely one of the most dramatic and heart-wrenching sagas within Power Rangers history, and is suitably placed within this compilation.
* 'To the Tenth Power' - the first team-up episode of current and past rangers that sparked the annual tradition thereafter, that brought the Space Rangers and the Lost Galaxy Rangers together to combat the return of the treacherous Psycho Rangers.
* 'Trakeena's Revenge' - Another team-up episode, in two parts, consisting of the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers and the Lost Galaxy Rangers joining forces to halt the coming return of a scarred Trakeena, who is stealing life-force energy from the residents of Mariner Bay in order to take revenge against the rangers.
* 'Forever Red' - the appropriately chosen tenth anniversary episode that brings all ten past red rangers together to thwart the plans of the remnants of the Machine Empire to take command of Lord Zedd's hidden personal zord, Serpenterra, in order to invade the Earth, subsequently avenging the destruction of King Mondo and his robotic family and empire.

'White Light Parts 1&2' were originally released on VHS in 1994 as part of Saban's 'All-Time Favourites' range of VHS releases and, subsequently, re-released when Buena Vista re-issued their previous releases via the 'Power Playback' collection.  Bringing it to DVD for the first time, along with other earlier episodes that weren't previously available on VHS format, is certainly a reason to celebrate in the Ranger community.  This collection of episodes gathered from the first ten seasons of Power Rangers, lasting 168 minutes (2 hours 48 minutes) and with an option to view with subtitles for the English hard-of-hearing, is sure to be a staple DVD on any shelf belonging to fans of the show, and to people reminiscing about a more innocent time during their childhood.  Also included are a few trailers from Disney's and Buena Vista Home Entertainment's then upcoming library of VHS and DVD releases for 'Power Rangers: Wild Force', 'X-Men: The Animated Series', 'Pokmon 4ever: The Movie' and 'George of the Jungle 2', along with the 'Best of Power Rangers' Soundtrack Compilation released on CD by Buena Vista Records.  The sheer nature of the collection also makes it an ideal introduction for any person who is relatively new to the Rangers' universe.  Now with Saban Brands having bought back the production and release rights to their Power Rangers line, earlier seasons are being distributed on DVD, via box-set releases, by Shout! Factory.  With the episodes on this 'Best Of' compilation being released within their respective season sets, this DVD could be seen as being made redundant by some.  However, for the hardened collector or for others who enjoy such best-of releases, this release serves as pleasant movie-style and standalone viewing.",1376697600,,5300,5.232311320754717
1805403,5,B00007AJGJ,My kids love The best of power rangers - the ultimate rangers. They can't put this stuff down. They watch it almost everyday.,1373587200,,125,4.478260869565218
1805404,4,B00007AJGJ,"Before we begin, I should talk about my history with Power Rangers.  I will give my past & present opinion for each of the first 8 seasons.  I was 4 when the original Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers came out, & like every other kid I loved the first 3 seasons.  Looking back there were definitely some good episodes, but for the most part the filler is a tad too cheesy for my tastes; the third season's still pretty good though.  But then Zeo came along, & even as a kid I thought it was better, with cooler powers, cooler costumes, cooler Zords & much cooler villains.  I still love it today, & wished I had recorded more than just the one where they destroy King Mondo with the Super Zeo Megazord (which later disappeared, no doubt buried under a recording of Pokemon).  I'm not the only one, on IMDB you can find several reviews for Zeo by people who hated the original show but enjoyed Zeo.  Then Turbo came along.  I still like the movie for it, & think it's the best episode from there next to Chase Into Space, but like many people I thought it was way too silly at times even as a kid, & almost completely dropped it after Tommy & the others left.  But I did tune into Chase Into Space & was hooked once again for the best season of the show, Power Rangers In Space.  To this day it remains an excellent season (I wish I had recorded it instead of stupid Pokemon!), & even as a kid I thought the finale meant that Power Rangers was over for good.  But as we all know it continued with Lost Galaxy.  I didn't watch it that much, but it was honestly pretty good & my 3rd favorite PR series, so far at least (I may end up ranking it fourth, after Might Morphin' season 3, or fifth if I really like Time Force).  Then we come to my final Power Rangers season, Lightspeed Rescue.  I really liked it at the time, but my mother didn't.  She's a Christian, & didn't like how they fought demons, saying ""Only God can fight demons.""  I've been a Christian since before I saw that season, so I thought it was a fair criticism though I continued watching it, but then she saw something on LR that made her want to ban all of Power Rangers from the house (I don't want to talk about it; it was at the beginning of the first episode with the mermaid.  I was looking forward to it, being a mermaid fan & looking for inspiration for my mermaid story; but she saw the woman hiding her lower torso under the water & thought something... naughty.).  I got rid of all my Mighty Morphin' tapes but kept the Turbo movie (Which was eaten by the VCR.  The VCR ate a lot of my other Power Rangers tapes before them too.  I guess that's shows how cheaply some of them were made.).  Looking back, I realize it wasn't the best season.  I wholeheartedly agree with Linkara's opinion of this season (You know, of That Guy With The Glasses fame?  He's doing a video series called the History of Power Rangers, where he recaps each season & discusses how he enjoyed them.  The most current one is Mystic Force.  I've seen every episode except for the one about Time Force.  I stopped watching that one after the intro, because the scene he played before it was so shocking I said to myself that I've got to see this show for myself.  I fast forwarded to the end where he said it was a great ride from start to finish.  If you're a Power Rangers fan, you must watch these videos.  Some of the series looked so good I decided to try them, like SPD & most certainly Dino Thunder; but to be honest I will see them all except for Mystic Force.  That one really didn't look worth my time.):  It's a real mixed bag.  The Rangers are great characters (especially Carter) & the Megazords are awesome, but the villains were just so boring.  I have to admit they look really cool, even today (apart from Jinxer); so I was probably just distracted by their design.  So yeah, I stopped watching PR for a bit, telling myself I'd watch the good seasons again when they were released on DVD.  And by this August Zeo, Turbo, In Space & Lost Galaxy will be released on DVD in one big boxset, & I have a 20% off coupon that won't be good until August (that's when my local FYE reopens after remodeling) with its name on it.  But to appease my appetite for good Power Rangers episodes I ordered this DVD, as it was relatively cheap & had 5 episodes that won't be on the boxset, 3 of which aren't available on any DVDs as far as I know, but since it's going to be a fair bit before I get any of the Mighty Morphin' sets (personally, I hope to someday buy the complete series pack just so I can have them all) it's more like 5.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia, because the ones on the back of the case weren't very good.

77-78.  White Light:  Kimberly announces exciting news...Tommy's coming back!  The Rangers are happy that Tommy's coming home.  They set out to plan a welcome home party for Tommy.  But their joy is cut short when Lord Zedd creates Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, which overpowers them.  To make matters worse, Zordon and Alpha 5 disappear without a word!  Looking back, the original show wasn't at all bad when the episodes actually counted as opposed to the filler.  A tad cheesy, but a lot of fun.  As much as I loved every episode back in the day, significant episodes like this always got my attention, & they hold up very well.  A+

292-293.  Countdown To Destruction:  The Millennium Message has come to pass.  Dark Specter sends the order for all villains in the universe to begin their assault on everything in sight.  The single greatest episode in Power Rangers history.  If this episode hadn't been on here, fans could have legally sued Disney for lying about the title of the DVD.  A+

323.  To the Tenth Power:  When Deviot brings the Psycho Rangers back, the Space Rangers come to Terra Venture to help our heroes defeat these maniacal menaces.  Though I liked Lost Galaxy, I never thought it was as good as In Space or Zeo.  But this episode justified its existence.  A+

367-368.  Trakeena's Revenge:  Trakeena returns to destroy Earth as vengeance for her defeat at the hands of the Lost Galaxy Rangers, but first, she must absorb enough human life force for power.  The Lost Galaxy Rangers travel to Earth to team up with the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers to stop her.  This is the worst episode on here, & why I deducted a star.  To quote Linkara it's not bad, it's just so average.  There is too much focus on the little girl.  If you most of her parts out, this could have been one episode, & I have to admit there is about one episode's worth of good footage here, so it could have been worse.  C+

452.  Forever Red:  Cole and 9 other Red Rangers from previous series unite to destroy the remaining Machine Empire soldiers.  A wonderful 10th anniversary episode.  A+

The only bad thing I have to say about that they chose Trakeena's Revenge when there were several other episodes they should have chosen over it, like Turbo's last episode Chase Into Space, or something from Time Force.  Or if they wanted to show all the post-In Space Rangers, they could have replaced it with the Lightspeed & Time Force team-up.  Or, and this is the #1 choice for me, they could have done the ORIGINAL team-up, not between In Space & Lost Galaxy, but the Zeo episode where they teamed up with the Alien Rangers!  That would have been awesome.  But overall it's a good selection, it just could have been a bit better.  But I'm still happy with it.",1370131200,,7458,4.354136429608127

1805422,5,B00007AJGJ,"When Disney bought Power Rangers there was a year of them just putting out a bunch of the classics on television and from that created the CD soundstrack and this great dvd. It has:

""White Light"" Pts 1 & 2 (MMPR Season 2)
This two part episode has been released over and over again on VHS, it was even on a music casette, figure that out. This episode is famous for getting an extremely high television rating. Great episode.

""Countdown to Destruction Pts 1 & 2 (PR In Space)
This is not only the season finale to Season 6 of Power Rangers, but is also the ending to the entire story arc of seasons 1-6. All of the villians from the seasons team up to take over the univsere. Some say it's the greatest episode of all time.

""To the Tenth Power"" (PR Lost Galaxy)
My personaly favorite episode where the Psycho Rangers (from PR In Space) return to take on the Galaxy Rangers. The Psycho Rangers are known by fans as the best of the villians in Power Rangers period. Love the episode, so glad it's on the dvd

""Trakeena's Revenge Pts 1 & 2 (PR Lightspeed Rescue)
This is the Lightspeed Rescue & Lost Galaxy team up episode, gets cartoony at times but still worth the watch. It's also released on VHS as ""Power Rangers in 3-D"" which if you have the glasses I suggest tossing them out. You'd get a better 3D effect looking through a ziplock bag)

""Forever Red"" (PR Wild Force)
This was a special episode (and believe me Wild Force didn't have too many) where 10 Red Rangers team up to fight an evil. It's a special episode to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Power Rangers. The episode also has voices from other rangers of the past (not counting the red rangers) and we get the beetleborgs recycled for this episode. How many more times you ever going to see the beetleborg suits???

My copy also came with a cool red ranger poster. So definetly a great dvd and now that Haim Saban bought back the franchise this dvd is now rare and a collector's item.",1326931200,,1954,4.383977900552487

1805426,5,B00007AJGJ,"I grew up with the original MMPR and watched on and off until ""Countdown to Destruction"" and have occasionally watched an episode here and there just to see what's happening (more recently tuned in to pretty much the whole season of ""Dino Thunder"" mainly because it featured the return of Tommy and watched the entire season of RPM, which was actually one of the better out of the Disney years). When I found out about this I was excited because I thought it would have several from the original series. I was wrong. I mean, where is the A-list material: there's an excellent evil twin episode in ""Mighty Morphin Mutants"", The Evil Green Ranger storyline, the two-part episodes ""The Green Candle"", ""Doomsday"" and ""Return of an Old Friend"" (season one), ""The Mutiny"", ""Green No More"", ""The Power Transfer"", ""The Wedding"", ""Return of the Green Ranger"" (from season two), ""Ninja Quest"", ""Changing of the Zords"", ""A Different Shade of Pink"", ""Master Vile and the Metallic Armor"", ""Hogday Afternoon"" (from season 3), ""A Zeo Beginning"", ""Revelations of Gold"" and ""Golden Homecoming"" and ""King For a Day"" (Zeo), ""Shift into Turbo"", ""Passing the Torch"" ""Clash of the Megazords"" and ""Chase into Space"" (Turbo), I really can't remember the ""Space"" episodes that well, but still all of these mentioned episodes were groundbreaking for the series many of these are fan-favorites (if not my own personal favorites). From this DVD, the only two episodes I ever recall watching in my lifetime are:

White Light- While the first season will always remain close to my heart, the second was good too. New villains, new Zords and eventually new Ranger replacements. I felt like a kid again and got really excited when the rockin' theme kicked in when they morphed and summoned the Zords. It was great to sit down and watch the original team in action. Lord Zedd truly was a great villain and was such a shame that he was tremendously toned down because parents deemed him ""too evil"". How can a villain be too evil? But despite his marriage to Rita (who makes a cameo), the evil duo did make things harder judging that a lot of episodes, after and including their wedding, were two or three part stories.

Countdown to Destruction- When I saw this back in '98 or '99, I was blown away! Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd, the Machine Empire, Divatox and Astronema are attacking the universe featuring cameos by the Aquatian Rangers (from season 3 of MMPR), the Gold Ranger (Zeo) and the Phantom Ranger and Blue Senturion (Turbo). Sad that Zordon had to die but in doing so, eradicated all evil. This is THE most epic episode that the series has put out and from I've seen, nothing will top it. I mean, these episodes wrapped up six years worth of story, villains and characters. A very emotional episode for most fans of the series, along with me. A part of my childhood ended when this episode aired. And after that was when I stopped watching all together as I literally thought that was the end of the series. A little cliche to say this but CtD is THE best out of the series and my favorite episode from the whole series.

How do the other episodes hold up to these? Except for one, not that well. Save for one episode (which I vaguely remember anyways), I never saw ""Lost Galaxy"" before this and thank God this was a team-up episode (so it stands alone from the rest of the season arc) and I wouldn't have latched on to the very quick and rushed story. And judging from the ending, this DVD should've included the other two parts to this obvious three part episode (UPDATE: have recently been watching the Lost Galaxy season and I must admit that it is one of the best seasons, easily being up there with the first six seasons in terms of story, scope and character development). Prior to this DVD, I also never saw ""Lightspeed Rescue"" and from what I've read, this was the weakest of all Power Ranger incarnations. The Red Ranger was stiff, the Yellow Ranger didn't know how to act and there was no possible way (judging from the flashback to the last episode of ""Lost Galaxy"") that Trakeena could've survived that explosion (UPDATE: also started watching Lightspeed Rescue and it isn't as bad as what I thought. Other than Vypra, the villains are pretty cool and the backstory to Carter was actually pretty good). As for the last episode from ""Wild Force"":

I WAS IMPRESSED! Not with the then-current Red Ranger mind you but the fact that TEN RED RANGERS TEAM UP to fight a long thought defeated enemy. Though this did deserve a two-part story, I was still delighted with Bulk and Skull's cameo and it was great to see Jason and Tommy again. And the fact that they reuse all the old morphing sequences (instead of creating new ones so they match with the current trend [if any old Power Ranger fans read this, look up the second part of the two part episode ""Once a Ranger"" from ""Operation Overdrive"" and you'll get what I mean) It was a great nostalgia factor for me to have so many past people and adventures referenced. And I found this humorous (as I watched the spin-off) that the remaining generals of the Machine Empire are made up of recycled costumes from ""Big Bad Beetleborgs"". Though I will admit, it was a cop-out for Serpenterra to be destroyed (when none of the much larger Thunderzords from season 2 could) by a little rinky dink motorcycle.

To conclude this rather long winded review, despite the cop-out ending of Forever Red, this was a great compiliation. And a shame that, after 2009, the Rangers will meet their match. Not by Rita, Zedd, Mesogog or Venjix, but by the most evil corporation ever; Disney! And I'd say that they're bringing back the original series would be a good thing but for those who have seen these ""brilliant"" re-versioned episodes, it isn't. And for those who haven't seen or heard about the old show returning, be warned! If season sets are released or if they plan on re-airing the rest of the series, I can only hope that Disney hasn't tainted them with Batman-esque effects.",1240444800,2,5998,4.660056657223796

1805442,5,B00007AJGJ,"Out of all the DVD's that were released I have to say this is the best one ever! The dvd is put together with a bunch of great episodes that is not shown on Tv . This dvd includes:

The White Light Pt. 1 and 2 (combined and made into one episode)

This episode is based on the creation of the white ranger and how the mighty morphing power rangers have to face Lord Zedds evil and are nearly taken down, when the new white ranger comes to the rescue.

Countdown To Destruction Pt. 1 and 2 (Again Combined and made into one episode)

This episode is the finale of the Power Rangers In Space. It's about Darkspecter summoning all the evil forces of Rita, Machine Empire, Divatox and any other past evil the power rangers have fought to attack the whole universe. The fate of the universe is in the hands of the Power Rangers In Space.

To The Tenth Power

Deviot(sp) gets these 5 key cards from this unknown alien and he uses them to re-awaken the Physco Rangers. The Physco Rangers Prey on the Galaxy rangers leaving them help less. Andros and the other space rangers are called to the aid of the Galaxy Rangers where both teams join forces to fight the evil of the Physco Rangers.

Trakeena's Revenge Pt. 1 and 2 (combined)

Trakeena ressurects and comes back with this new alien friend and army, she with the help of Olyimpus captures humans and Drains their energy for the use of their evil plan. In order to stop this the Light Speed Rangers must Join forces with the Galaxy Rangers.

Forever Red

Seppenterra has been released from her cosmic Tomb. Together with General Venjix and his new weapon they'll try to incinerate Earth. In order to stop this all Red rangers must come together and form their own team but will this be enough?

Those were the basic Descriptions of each episode. I apologize if some descriptions are unclear. I personally love every single episode on this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I recommend you to get this dvd if you are a fan of Power Rangers.

This DVD comes with a nice Forever Red Poster with all of the red rangers standing side by side in the setting of the moon's surface. On the back a picture of each individual red ranger is shown with their human name underneath it. The DVD also comes with an Extra card showing the 5 random rangers that is on the cover and on the back of the card it includes the titles of each episode.

1805443,5,B00007AJGJ,"I was soo glad when I heard that this DVD was coming out. I am hoping that there have been enough sales, so we can all convince Disney to re-release all of the episodes, not just the new ones. For those of you who were fans from the beginning, like me, this DVD is the one to buy.",1083024000,2,280,3.8448275862068964
1805444,5,B00007AJGJ,"Power Rangers is an amazing show, and has affected many people in very positive ways. Now that many of the original power ranger viewers are entering young adulthood, and taking their love for the power rangers with them, I'm sure this show will only grow bigger in popularity. Their are many good episode choices in this DVD including 'countdown to destruction' and definitly 'Forever Red'. While the dvd is low on extras it is still a pretty good DVD. I highly recommend it!

These are (to me) the best shows ever in the . If anything just get the DVD for ""Forever Red"" where else can you see the Power Ranger beat up Big Bad Beetle Borgs? If you don't know what Im talking about why are you even looking at this page? GO GO POWER RANGERS!!!!!!",1071619200,2,417,4.160493827160494
1805446,3,B00007AJGJ,"I can't comment on the DVD but I have seen these episodes and that's what I am basing my rating on. I think they were all great choices except for ""Trakkena's Revenge."" While it wasn't a bad episode from ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"", it wasn't all that great. I think a better choice would've been ""End Of Time"" from Power Rangers Time Force or, if you had to have another crossover of Ranger teams, ""Reinforcements From The Future"" that had Time Force team with Wild Force.
Still, this doesn't sound like a bad DVD.",1062806400,5,521,4.553191489361702
