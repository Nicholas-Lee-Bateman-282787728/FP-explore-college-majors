The filming was excellent, the music was even good. Actually really good. I've always been a big fan of Malcolm Smith and it was fun to see his son as a person and a rider. What a frikkin hoot!
I'll definitely buy the next one.",1278547200,,356,4.409090909090909

I sent an email to the company and received a response from ""Chris"" saying that they were sorry for the mix up and would send the 08 video as soon as possible.  Well it's now Aug and still no 2008 video.  Poor customer service!",1251590400,,329,4.109375
