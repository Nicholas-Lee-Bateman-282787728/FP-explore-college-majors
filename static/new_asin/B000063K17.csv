Transformers are and will be apart of me. This set brings the kid in me out. Just in time for the new comics and all. If you like transformable robots like Gundam. These are the next best in USA. Transformers are just timless. I will enjoy my DVD's and hope you like them as well. ""Transformers: More Then Meets The Eyes.""",1015372800,3,387,4.243243243243243
1693254,5,B000063K17,"As a kid I loved transformers, however all the episodes were not shown in England. And now I see they are releasing the full first season in this cool box set. All I can say to that is WOW!!!!
Let's hope all the other seasons will get the same treatment, I can't wait!",1015372800,2,268,4.0754716981132075
1693255,5,B000063K17,"While I'll be the first to admit that the animation doesn't quite hold up to my memories (or to more modern fair), the fact is the Transformers dvd's are still great.  It's amazing just setting there and after having not seen them years, being able to recall some of the episodes as you watch.  The old cartoons are also great for some of the newer fans who are only familiar with the more recent ""Beast"" Transformers as the original series ties in directly with it's continuity.  A great series that never seems to deminish in age, and is great for both the older fan and the younger.",1015286400,2,585,4.4485981308411215

I hope this trend continues, and that we can expect to see the whole series on DVD like this eventually.

1693257,5,B000063K17,"Growing up as a die hard Transformers fan, i have been collecting all of the Transformers on DVD and appriciate the fact that they have left them alone and not teched them up.  Watching them on DVD brings back alot of my childhood to me and the same can be said for many others that i have talked to.",1014940800,,300,4.084745762711864
1693351,4,B000063K17,"I saw this show for the first time in 86. Im thinking 'how cool is that?' Seeing cars and planes turn into robots. Even a robot turns into a gun. Honestly that is amazing. Its a story of two factions fighting against each other. The autobots and decepticons. Still its just cool. It was a well produced show. Then later it was aired in japan with the 'Transformers' title The plot being the same as the original american release. i saw both. I thought both versions were good. But thats not the only thing i wanted to talk about.. Its the item itself.
  The case on the front is a shiny silver reflective surface. With the autobot logo and the lettering 'Transformers' engraved on. I could almost see myself off the silver surface. Along the spine it says Transformers. The back has a list of the episodes on the left side. The manner of how this case opens is like a book. One side has an image of optimus prime. The other side has an image of megatron. rumble in the background in battle with wheeljack. Fully  opening the case, It contains four discs. 16 episodes in this set. Disc 1 contains the first 5 episodes. Disc 2 contains 5 episodes and Disc 3 contains 6 episodes. Disc 4 contains the special added features. This is where it gets pretty good. Disc 4 has the japanese show opening themes as one of the special features. An added feature to this set. On the inside of the cover, there is a poclet. Inside it is a booklet explaining each of the episodes and the characters. The real bonus is the cells each one depicting a scene from an episode in the show. Taken from the 35mm film reel.
 For one thing rhino did a good job reproducing the format of the whole series. Digitally putting each one into DVD format. The sound effects and music are like the original but more crisp. And gives more effect. Its still just as good as it was 20 years ago.",1398729600,,1858,4.361271676300578

1693412,5,B000063K17,"I never got into GI Joe as a kid. It was always the Transformers. So of course I had to buy this set.

I don't know if other people liked it, but one of my favorite things about this release is that they did not correct some of the errors in the original production. For example, I know the color discrepancies have been mentioned and complained about. I actually like that Rhino did not fix them. I know that what I'm seeing is the same show that I saw as a little kid. It also lets me appreciate how far animation production has come in the last 25 years.

I'm not going to get into the series, because most people who are looking to buy this set are already Transformers fans and know pretty much what they're getting into. Just be aware that you're getting a cartoon that was produced in the early 1980s.",1291939200,,808,4.240259740259741

1693442,4,B000063K17,"This set a limited tin release of the Transformers Complete first season released by Rhino in 2002. This is a rare commodity since it is no longer made. Sony/BMG is apparently preparing to re-release the Cartoons again this spring, But it will be hard to beat this set with the two limited edition Cells.  Nice quality, excellent package. See how the transformers got to earth and the fight between the autobots and decepticons.  Its funny watching these now as an adult, I am seeing some of small detail flaws, such as episode 7 with Skyfire, starscream is a plane on cybertorn in the past, but that does not coincide with the first episode where he was changed to a jet when repaired on earth, or why does optimus prime get scared of falling from a cliff when he can fly?  Its fun to watch for these inconsitencies, but overall just fun to relive a piece of childhood nastalgia. A great cartoon, storyline ahead of its time. Great action as well.  Must have for the transformers fan.",1167004800,2,985,4.579545454545454
1693443,4,B000063K17,"I am a big Transformers geek. I only had a few episodes on tape, so you can imagine how excited I was to finally see many of these episodes again! Why, then, have I given this a mere 4 stars instead of 5?

 The special features. There aren't many. What is there is pretty good, but there should have been more. More!

 The sound. There are some spots where they've added unnecessary sound effects. It's a minor thing, but it can get distracting and annoying.

 But all that is very little to complain about when you can finally relive some of your favorite old episodes, without the shakey grainyness of worn out old VCR tapes.... often with commercials or such. A MUST HAVE FOR G1 FANS! REQUIRED VIEWING!",1160524800,2,705,4.46875
1693444,4,B000063K17,"I used to love this show as a kid and, now that I have kids of my own, I had to buy this set. Overall, it's still a good show. The poor quality control (transformers colored wrong, wrong voices, transforming in reverse, etc) can get a little tedious at times, as can the bumpers (why were these not removed?). Still, if you were a Transformers fan, and are willing to part with a decend chunk of money, I'd recommend getting this.",1151452800,4,430,4.320987654320987
1693445,3,B000063K17,"Anyone reading this is a fan. And if you're a fan, this is a must have, as others who grew up with the Transformers, have repeatedly said. I'm grateful that this DVD box set was made available and admit that I STILL watch the epsisodes on boring nights when I want to unwind and feel like a kid again. The writing was excellent and made for a superior cartoon.

Like many other childhood fans, I taped the episodes when they were on TV and watched them over and over again as a younster. I just couldn't get enough! I practically had all the dialogue and little glitches memorized. Those tapes are long gone so you can imagine my uncontrollable, child-like excitement when I spotted the box set in the store.

That said, I began to watch the episodes with an ear to ear grin and relive my childhood. My memory was jarred and the dialogue was all coming back to me as I watched. ALSO, I was really looking forward to seeing the episodes truly ""remastered"" with all the improvements of modern technology...not to mention the anticipation of seeing all those annoying little color and voice glitches corrected...or so I thought. I almost felt cheated not only to see all the glitches still there but EVEN MORE glitches than the original! MORE color gaffes and flaws! I couldn't believe they went thru all this trouble and produced a product that had MORE mistakes than back in 1984! How irresponsible and careless! They even added silly sound effects where they were none in some cases! ""Divide and Conquer"" is especially rife with extra (and annoying) sound effects and more color mistakes than the original! I actually still have that episode on VHS and side by side, the VHS version is actually better: fewer flaws than the DVD! I fully expected all the mistakes to fixed. In a remastered DVD, I expected perfection for all of us who cherish the memories. Not only were all the mistakes ignored but they added new ones!! I can't say it enough. I still shake my head. It's like taking the same test twice with the benefit of seeing the answers between attempts and scoring LOWER on the second. Inexcusable! Utterly amazing!

Oh well, I still have them and love them. But, it must be said: Shame on Rhino Video! Shame! You delivered a less than half-hearted effort. Half-hearted would have simply been an exact duplicate. I would glady repurchase a PERFECTLY remastered addition if anyone with the rights to it is listening.",1146268800,11,2422,4.667447306791569
1693446,5,B000063K17,"If you log on Ebay at any random time, you are likely to find literally about 7,000-9,000 Transformers items listed.  Transformers are definitely a major part of American (and worldwide) pop culture, and the original Sunbow Series is what got it all rolling.  Sure, the toys came out at the same time, but without the TV show, they never would have remained so popular for over 20 years now.

Now, as of right now, there are only 3 ways to acquire these episodes.

1) Pick up a tape that has episodes taped off of television.  The drawback here is that some tapes from the mid 1980's have obviously held up a lot better than others and you also have to deal with the commercials (seeing them once or twice can be fun, though.

2) Pick up some of the VHS tapes that were released a few years later.  These are professional tapes, should be fairly durable and this time, no commercials.

3) You're looking right at this one, and that is the DVD version.  The DVD version has a couple of definite advantages over the tapes and that's firat, that you don't have to hunt down all the episodes and secondly, that you can flip through them a lot easier.

A drawback of the DVD series is that Rhino seemed to rush it a bit and made some mistakes in the coloring of characters in some scenes.  But heck, it doesn't bother me because I can tell Starscream apart from Thundercracker and Skywarp just based on how they act, their voices and what they say.  All the errors are minor stuff like that and if you're paying attention, it shouldn't detract from the story much.

It should also be noted that despite these mistakes, the overall look of the shows is much crisper than even the originals were.  Easily the nicest the animation overall has ever looked for these original episodes.

However, Rhino, who produced these DVD's has since been bought out by Sony and this DVD set is no longer being widely sold.  So my advice is pick them up while you still can.",1138924800,4,1951,4.453521126760563
1693447,5,B000063K17,"This show is the best.  I loved it as a kid and love it just as much now.  All the sets of the seasons are great, this one is also a great start if you are new to the series.  The picture quality is damn near perfect and the sound is great too.  The animation of the first season I feel wasn't as good a quality as with season two (though many episodes hear are better than some that would later appear in season 3).  I've had all the collections for awhile now, but felt the need to review them.  The stories are well written (especially for a show that was basically intended to be a half hour commercial for toys.)  If you were or are a Transformers fan, these sets are a must own.  They beat the hell out of the Transformers cartoons that are on today.",1138579200,2,756,4.0608108108108105
1693448,5,B000063K17,"I was a little leery buying this collection.  Several of the shows I watched as a kid haven't held up for me as an adult.  I was plesently surprised by the Trasformers and have become a fan all over again thanks to this set.  While the stories are a bit simplistic, the dialoge and jokes are still entertaining today.  It was great getting to watch the series all over again, and it didn't seem as dumbed down as many cartoons today feel.  If you were a fan as a kid, I recommend it highly, and it just may create a fan of any kids you have as well.",1126224000,4,549,4.046296296296297
1693449,5,B000063K17,""" The Transformers"" is a phenomenal cult animated 80's TV show that is half-American/Half-Japanese based on a toyline of transforming robots about an ancient race of robots that have existed since the dawn of time as two teams of robots known as the good Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the evil Decepticons led by Megatron have wedge a war eons ago as they crashed landed on Earth. Now a million years later, they have reawaken to find only that the Decepticons especially Megatron want Earth's resources to create energon cubes to make a special thing that can take over both the Earth and the universe, only the Autobots joined by two humans ""Spike"" and ""Sparkplug"" can stop them.

This is a masterful show that was often considered as a Toy commercial by some but i think it's an intelligent, action packed and well done half-anime show that still holds up today and it's still as phenomenal as it was in the 80's, it spawned some spin-offs like the notable ""Beast Wars"", video games, lots of toys, an animated movie and a upcoming Michael Bay directed movie, it's a wonderful achievement in animation. The DVD set contains 3 Discs that contain 16 episodes of the first season from 1984-1985 especially the origin of the transformers, the rebirth of a long lost transformer named ""Skyfire"" and the introduction to the dim-witted but lovable Dinobots especially great remastered picture and sound quality that is unbelivable including the original mono. The fourth DVD contains great extras like a look into the 2001 Botcon convention ( A transformers convention), a restoration feature on how they digitally remastered the original tapes to DVD, American & Japanese bumpers, bloopers and false starts, anomalies, Japanese and American alternate sequences, original screenplay to episode 4 "" Transport to Oblivion"" and an interview with the Botcon Organizer Glen Halit.

Highly recommended DVD set and animated series! i also recommend "" He-Man and The masters of the Universe"", "" Thundercats"", ""She-Ra"", ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Danger Mouse"".",1122422400,3,2040,5.068452380952381
1693450,5,B000063K17,"I have been a long time fan of one of the greatest shows ever devised, The Transformers. This box set was well worth the price to relive those classic first season episodes. Classic characters were introduced to us such as OPTIMUS PRIME, JAZZ, BUMBLEBEE, IRON HIDE, RATCHET and WHEELJACK, as well as the Decepticon characters like MEGATRON, STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and THUNDERCRACKER. It was about time they finaly put The Transformers out on glorious DVD 5.1, i was getting tired of crappy VHS cassette tapes!

Rhino did a great job getting these episodes on DVD properly, and i might add that they are of better quality then when they originaly aired! Transformers were my first obsession ever, from the days of watching the show to collecting the toys were good memories. The first season started out with the three pilot episodes of the origins of the Transformers and how they came to Earth. These pilots were basically ment to be glorified toy commecials with no intent of acctualy making a whole series after it. No one knew that this effort to sell toys would gain such popularity and grow in too almost four seasons and a motion picture and become one of the biggest phenomenons ever. Although season 1 is not my favorite of them all (season 2 is) it is close, because it laid the groundwork for all future Transformers episodes. Even though season 1 only has 16 episodes, it establishes the arival of Autobots and Decepticons and their foothold in the world around them, both factions are considered threats by humanity, but that changes as Optimus Prime and the Autobots make it their priority to stop Megatrons attempt to exploit the earth and its resources. Season 1 had tons of great episodes and introduced several sub factions of Transformers such as the Dinobots,the Constructicons and the Insecticons, all who play major roles in the Transformers universe. There are a few thing about the show that do get formulatic and thought provoking though, it always works out that every episode is Megatron/Decepticons trying to generate energon cubes or developing some method to defeat Prime, and always utterly failing horribly at it and getting their @$$es kicked every time. You would think that the Decepticons, being a warrior faction and having an endless supply of weapons and renforcments via Cybertron, could get the job done with out too much trouble, but they always managed to steal defeat from the jaws of victory for some reason. You had classic characters like Grimlock, that while powerful (he could both kick the s h i t out of both Prime and Megatron), had the intelligence of a brick,(""Me Grimlock!"").And who could forget about Starscream? he almost brought a comedic aspect to the show, with his temper tantrums and ego trips. There is the greatest cartoon character ever created, Optimus Prime, who is charismatic and brave, and he is worth this box sets price alone. I thought  Season 1 did it's job of basically introducing all of the charcters well, and the episodes are pretty good, but it would get better,as season 2 really defined the show for me.

This box sets overall qaulity is good and well worth the money, and the extras were a real bonus in addition to it. Most DVD box sets of TV shows are just lacking, but Rhino just went all out with this. If you remember the show at all, you are definatly gonna want this, as well as Season 2 part 1&2 and Season 3 and 4.",1115942400,3,3405,4.7677966101694915
1693481,5,B000063K17,"I was born the same year that this great show came out, but when I was able to read, write, and understand at around 3 or 4yrs old, I fell in love with TRANSFORMERS, and how cool it was to see cars transform into robots and back as ORDINARY CARS. I was told many of years that my Grandpa's 88 Honda Accord and 66 Chevy Pickup, could transform but only at night when I was asleep :P Later to realize my dreams were crushed :(

But I still loved the show, and finally am impressed they came out with the DVD box set season 1. The GOLD OL ANIME DRAWN cartoons. Unfortunatly, the newer cartoons, TRANSFORMERS ARMADA/ENERGON (watch it with my nephews) the animation put into the present day TRANSFORMERS has gotten as lazy as some of the viewers themselves. Not hand-drawn like this good old epic series, just cutpaste computer done now....poorly. Sound quality is good, especially after the timeline its been through of 20+ years.

1693482,5,B000063K17,"I missed this series for years after it went off the air. Just watching these episodes reminds me of my childhood and when I would watch it on Saturday mornings. It's been said before, but this show is from when TV cartoons were actually worth something. I'm big on nostalgia and if you enjoyed this series a child, then I suggest buying even if only for sentimental reasons. Watching this show I can almost get the feeling the 1980's really haven't gone away...",1111881600,,462,4.578313253012048
1693483,5,B000063K17,"I turned 26 today. I started watching Transformers when I was about 6. I used to get Transformers for Christmas and my B-day, so this was always a wonderful time of year. 20 years later I get to have a Transformer for my B-day again. Awesome.

As I child, I didnt't care so much about plot lines or animation quality. These were robots that turned into stuff. How great is that! Now that I am older I recognize that the story's were a little iffy and the animation is pretty weak, but that is not why someone like me enjoys this stuff. I enjoy it simply because it reminds me of a more innocent time. A time when good and evil was black and white...and a time when robots turned into things!

Seriously, the production quality is not bad. Better than I thought after reading a bunch of the reviews on here. I can't comment on the surround sound, but I do have my DVD player running through my stereo and everything sounds awesome. The picture looks fine. No problem. If you were a trans fan in the 80s and want to enjoy a bit of your past, than this collection is a must.",1105056000,3,1071,4.245098039215686
1693484,3,B000063K17,"It's great to see the original series come out for all to enjoy. It allows us to revisit our past as we see characters we once idolized restored for our viewing pleasure. Whether you are new to the series and just want to see how things started off, or if you where there in the beginning and just wanted to be reminded, this DVD set is a must buy for any transformers fan with a DVD player.

The first season shows everything from how the Autobots and Decepticons ended up on Earth to the creation of the Dinobots and the appearance of the first combiners set. Getting to see the original clashes between Optimus Prime and Megatron alone is priceless for a fan of the franchise, but all this classic material adds up to be more then a worthy aquisition.

The first season wasn't the best season overall though. It was a kids show after all, and while a lot of it isn't as bad as some of the newer cartoons (I really annoyed me in Armada and Energon how kids and teenagers constantly had to be the heroes themself and try to fight with the autobots against the decepticons when it was clear they were out of their league) there is still plenty of corny-ness abound. On top of that, the fact that a lot of the G1 transformers looked the same doesn't help much either (colors got confused a lot between Thundercracker, Starscream, and Skywarp for instance). However, flaws and dated material will no doubt not be able to keep most transfans down.",1104883200,,1444,4.445283018867925
1693485,3,B000063K17,"While I will agree with the other reviews on here that this set (along with the rest of the box sets now available) have great features and provide a trip down memory lane, I have to point out that all these sets have one major flaw: poor telecining.

Rhino went back to the original 35mm film masters to create these releases, which was a great gesture on their part.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that they probably spent a pretty penny cleaning the film for the best source possible, they completely screwed it up by using an inferior telecining machine (a telecine transfers film to video).  The transfer suffers from heavy aliasing (jaggies) and cadence that constantly changes from 3/2 pulldown to 2/2.  If you want a really good example, watch the opening pan of Cybertron in the pilot episode.  There's terrible aliasing everywhere.  Because the cadence is irregular, there are also a lot of combing artifacts present, assuming you're trying to watch the show on a progressive scan TV.  Sadly, the only way to partially fix these problems is to get a progressive DVD player with the Faroudja chip (ie. Denon, etc.).  The Faroudja chip successfully fixes the aliasing problem in the opening Cybertron pan, but can't fix the aliasing problem in other shots where the characters stand still.  It's definately the worst on Megatron, where the black lines outlining his light grey body are very easy to spot.

I'm not sure why other people have missed this very blatant flaw.  Maybe they're watching the show on a 20"" or smaller TV.  When I had my 27"" TV I could see the artifacts as clear as day, and now my 43"" progressive TV magnifies them to a very annoying degree.  I'm not the first person to see these artifacts; search the web and you'll find other reviews that mention this problem.

Of course, any TF fan will have no choice but to pick up these sets regardless.  It's either that or pray that HD-DVD versions get released in a few years with hopefully better telecining.",1100131200,3,1987,4.718840579710145
1693486,5,B000063K17,"This season of the Transformers is great.  The animation quality is above and beyond similar series' of the time (Gundam/DBZ) and the storytelling is really fun and very interesting.  The introduction of the main/original Autobots and Decepticons are great, and the random transition from the crashlanding on earth to millions of years later in present day America always makes me laugh.

Optimus Prime was my hero as a kid and he still is.  I just can't get enough of that guy and I look up to him in every way possible.  There isn't a better example of selfless love, compassion, and caring (with the exception of Jesus) in the world today.  Optimus Prime is the truest soul ever created, and watching him save people time and time again is a great experience, especially on these restored DVDs.  The picture quality is great, and the sound quality is much better than when originally aired.  I highly recommend this season.",1099353600,,926,4.8164556962025316
1693487,5,B000063K17,"Ok, there are tons of reviews nit-picking every little detail in this box set. I am not going to do that. If you look for mistakes hard enough you will find them, hell you will spot them easily in this box set. But if you are looking to be entertained, as you were when you were a kid watching this series, then you will feel like a kid again seeing this series come to life again on DVD. This is not your kid's Beast Wars or Beast Machines or Transformers Armada, Energon or whatever other boring, bad-animation, rip-off that spun off of one of the greatest cartoons/toy-lines ever. No, this is the original and best.
From the introduction of the Transformers in the 3-part opening episodes ""More Than Meets The Eye"" to the introduction of Skyfire (Fire In The Sky) & Dinobots (S.O.S Dinobots & War Of The Dinobots) to the introduction of the Constructicons (Heavy Metal War) & the Insecticons (A Plague Of Insecticons). This first season is what started it all. None of us would be writing reviews, or caring about the Transformers all these years later, if not for this first season.
The 2nd season gets better with introductions of Omega Supreme, the Aerialbots and others.
The 4th disk is all Special Features with bumpers, Botcon special and oher extras and outtakes. The first Box Set is definately one of the best.
The animation and characters stand the test of time. This was long before they created Transformers with little or no character. Optimus Prime is one of the best leaders ever in a cartoon, cool characters like Sideswipe, Jazz, Bumblebee and many others in the first season left us fans wanting more and more.
The only problem I have with the Transformers cartoon continuity (not this box set but the overall series) is that there seems to be chunks of story cut out. For example, how did Teletran One get destroyed? What happened to the Ark? Where did Transformers from the Movie come from originally? Was Hot Rod built by the Autobots on Earth or was he a rebuilt Autobot from Cybertron? Same for Sky Lynx. Who created Autobot City aka Metroplex? What happened to Sparkplug (Spike's Dad)?

Personally, I blame the overexposure of many such shows on channels like Cartoon Network and Fox Kids. Somewhere among the syndication of modern, lifeless animation, greats like He-Man, MASK, The Real Ghostbusters and Transformers have slipped away and been forgotten.
Thank heavens for Rhino. Not only have they digitally remastered the entire first season here but they have also given us a cracking Dolby 5.1 track (the bass is strong and it will surely give your whole system a good workout, tho it can be a bit strident at times) but a whole load of extras too.
There is a feature on the animation goofs (two Starscreams in one shot!), a documentary on Botcon (the Transformers convention) which makes me jealous that we don't get anything like that here in the UK, Japanese clips of the show and 2 limited-edition cells. Wow! It's well worth the price.

1693543,5,B000063K17,"The Transformers may be the greatest television advertisement ever for a toy, but it was also a pretty good show, too.  The premise is that there are two groups of transforming robots living on the planet Cybertron.  These two groups, the Autobots and the Decepticons, have been at war with each other for a long time now and their planet is almost out of the energy necessary to keep things running for very much longer.  Both the Autobots and the Decepticons flee Cybertron to seach for another source of energy, but their ships crash on Earth.  4 million years later they awake (which puts them around the present day) and continue their war and search for energy to return to Cybertron and to restore Cybertron to prominence.
The Decepticons, led by Megatron, have one goal: to strip the Earth of its resources to create Energon cubes, and return to Cybertron to rule the Universe.  The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are the good guys, and are trying to stop them and are trying to protect this new planet that they are coming to care for.  This is a simple premise, but one which works over the course of the first season.  Megatron hatches plot after plot to gain the energy he needs, and the Autobots stop him.  In the process, there is a huge amount of destruction and damage to Earth, though we never see all of the human death and suffering that surely must have occurred as a result.  This is a battle of good versus evil.
I watched the Transformers on television as a child, and thinking back, I believe that every episode I saw back then was part of this season.  These are episodes that I remembered even before I purchased this set.  We are introduced to the Autobots, the Decepticons, the Dinobots, the Insecticons, and the Constructicons, and also Skyfire.  That is a whole lot of toys to buy!  Having watched the show again after all these years it is not surprising to find that some things are kind of cheesy now and that some of the dialogue is rather bad.  Despite that, no flaw in the show lessened my enjoyment.  These are the Transformers, a show I loved as a child and a show that I can still enjoy as an adult.",1074643200,5,2139,4.4909560723514215

It brought back a lot of memories and I think this was one of the best purchases I have made all year.

He watched all 16 episodes in one day! I find myself a child again telling him about Bruticus and Menasor aswell as all the great characters like Soundwave. I don't know what's wrong with cartoons these days but at least we have these great dvds to rekindle the faith.
 There maybe some continuity issues with say Sky Fire's emblem changing color every time you see him but you can't beat the voice overs of Megatron, Starscream, Optimus Prime(the Semi, not the tow truck) & Soundwave.

The never ending battle between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons is documented in this 4 DVD collectors set.
I bought the DVD and quickly threw it into my player (you gotta have surround sound) and my journey back in time began.
The Good- The animation cells have been digitally touched up as well as allot of the audio. On the bonus disk, you can see and hear exactly how poor some of the film and audio was prior to digital transfer. The colors are brilliant and probably look even better then they did 15 years ago. The audio in some cases is in surround sound with ripping highs and low bass. Examples of such would be laser fire and explosions.
The Bad- Well of course the Decepticons are bad but besides that, the bad would have to be the dialogue in some cases. Granted I was like 10 years old when this came out originally and it was probably written as such but some of it is just poorly written and mindless. Points of interest here would be, in the first season Megatron is assumed to be dead about a half a dozen different times. Also the Autobots never seem to give up trying to blow the Decepticon up by burying them in a cave with explosions. The Decepticons 1 out of every 3 times seem to go after a power plant. Its like the writers had stories for the first 3 or 4 episodes as well as the last 3 or 4 and just kind of slapped it together in between.
The Ugly- Without being way to critical, the animation and voice work has something to be desired. Mis-colored characters, wrong voices overdubbed, characters are frequently drawn out of perspective to each other and so on. Characters in some cases are transforming down when the should be transforming up and vice versa.
Overall though, I thought that this was very well redone given the medium or lack there of in some cases, that the editors had to work with. I would recommend this to any fan of the transformers both young and dare I say old.",1048809600,,2201,4.464019851116626
1693582,3,B000063K17,"...Ah, the first season at last!...I am going more in-depth into the episodes and why I gave this only three stars.  I'd rather not go into any plot summaries because all you transfans KNOW what they're about.
More Than Meets The Eye, Pts. 1,2,3
A great opening episode for the series, if a bit rough around the edges.  No complaints on any parts of this premiere.
Transport to Oblivion
Again, great episode.
Roll For It
I never really cared much for this episode, but it was still good.
Divide and Conquer
One of the first Transformers episodes I ever watched and one of the best also.
Fire in the Sky
One of my favorites!  This also has the best remastering transfer in the season, and I'm quite pleased with it.  Rhino even fixed some of the errors that were already there.
SOS Dinobots
Who cannot like this episode?  The Dinobots are introduced here (well, 3 of them) and a good episode to showcase them.
Fire on the Mountain
Great episode, but here's where the seams start to show.  Rhino screwed up some parts in this episode, mostly coloration errors.  Weird.
War of the Dinobots
One of my favorites, a definite classic!
The Ultimate Doom Pts. 1,2,3
Good remastering transfer of a good 3-part episode.  No complaints.
Countdown to Extinction
Ok episode, ok transferring.
A Plague of Insecticons
A great episode, but it's another one that Rhino didn't do quite right.
Heavy Metal War
ACK!  My favorite of the season is butchered!  Several messed up and reanimated scenes.  WHY?!
Overall, it's still worthy for your Transformers collection.  But my suggestion is not to buy it for full price ($60).  I suggest getting it used at a pawn shop or somewhere else.  I sure wish Rhino didn't screw up Fire on the Mountain and Heavy Metal War.  Sounds harsh, I'm sorry, but I'm a major fan.

I have my original videotapes from the original broadcast of the series, so I was able to compare, for instance in 'Fire on the Mountain' when the DVD switched Skywarp's colors for Thundercracker and colored Skyfire black...which, for all the mistakes that occurred in the original version, DID NOT occur in the original.  I also noted that the soundtrack throughout this and subsequent collections seems to be missing an entire track, most noticeable in the theme song and the missing bumper music.  Considering that Rhino must have known about the large fandom (something which, for instance, had to be taken into consideration by the writers of Beast Wars and subsequent series, and Hasbro) by the fact they have been spending the money to put out multiple versions of each episode, its inescusable that they didn't use that resource in replacing missing parts, as well as just simply putting out the best quality product that they could.

Picture and sound rendition is excellent! does justice to DVD.
The 3 star rating is because i have seen some errors that have not been there before the advent of transformers on DVD. For example episode ""Heavy Metal Wars"" Starscream notes to Megatron that his boast of defeating the autobots is vaguely familiar. The voice is starscream but the character is Skywarp!
  RHINO what did U do to this season, YES ITS GREAT to see this cartoon series on an excellent medium for viewing video.  But reading other reviews i went back and watched season 1 and sorry to say but errors popped up more as i watched. The before mentioned title, ""Heavy Metal War"" has been BUTCHERED!
A list of errors in ""heavy Metal War""
1.  Beginning of the episode megatron upon landing to issue a challenge the scene changes for an instant to the gladitorial fight near the end of the episode.
2. The dinobots confront the constructions', Snarl whips his tail and a bolt hits Scrappers shoulder, here is the mistkae NO! smoke rises from the impact point? for some time.
3.  During the gladitorial fight Megatron transports out of the way of a flying boulder, but he still remains there after the boulder impacts with the ground & breaks in two.
4. At the end a holgraphic projection gives the Dinobots the upperhand against devatator, they advance and shots of each dinobot is shown firng upon Devastator, but no fire emerges from Slug's nostrils?
These errors are not there on the previously released versions i have and are a result of the work done for the DVD version. there are other errors in other episodes.  But if you haven't seen transformers in years' you probably won't recognise them.  RHINO! for the following seasons show us more dedication to the creative process and don't make obvius mistakes...

1693630,2,B000063K17,"It seems every time I read a review on Rhino's Transformers DVD, it's always as though they did a fantastic job -  this is far from being true. There is always a tremendous amount of quality and motion lost when analog is transferred to digital.
Errors: First off there are many new errors that were not in the original analog masters. In ""Heavy Metal War"" Iron Hide transforming is backwards. There is also a serious digital glitch! There are also scenes which have ""digital pauses"" and even incorrect colors that were not in the original masters that we grew up with.
Colors: Some of the colors like the oranges and greens appear to be crisper, but Rhino overdid it enhancing ""fake"" digital color which results in a quick-buck production. Green water when it was originally blue, yellow-greenish sky's when it was originally whiteish, and orange rocks when they were originally brown -  I cannot understand why people think they did such a wonderful job?
Sound: Amateur mixing and no compression, vocals are at times too loud or sound effects such as explosions, too low or poorly enhanced. They also added in sound effects at parts where there were none originally, such as with the intros and bumpers, and they do NOT sound like anything from the original sound.
Overall this DVD is nice for those who want an inexpensive, digital collection of the original Season One Transformers, but don't expect it to surpass the originals.",1038787200,31,1432,4.840816326530613
1693631,5,B000063K17,"Let me say, the 5.1 mix was a bad idea to begin with, and it was very poorly executed.  Few episodes have a balanced sound mix.  One might assume you can resolve the problem by switching to the stereo track, right?  Wrong.  The stereo track is simply the same 5.1 track down-mixed, so imbalances still exist.  It's horribly unprofessional.  Rhino, get someone who understands how to mix a soundtrack for Season Two... PLEASE.
As for all the mistakes in the animation, people need to seriously lighten up.  New mistakes exist because the source material was NOT the same as the original broadcasts, and these are few and far between.  Old mistakes are still present, just as I remembered them.  Blue Primes, clone Bumblebees, and clone/mis-colored Starscreams, Thundercrackers and Skywarps.  Be forewarned, the animation can range from Sorta Okay to Amazingly Bad.  It's much worse than I remember, and that's not Rhino's fault.
In the end, I'm still glad I bought it.  Much of the cartoon is just as I remember and it's a lot of fun to watch.  If you're going to knock Rhino for anything, make it the sound.

I forgot how good this show really was.  It was incredibly loyal to the each of the characters and everything at this point.  The voice actors are an all star cast as well.
The remastering job was very good when you consider what they had to work with to start.  They cleaned up a lot of noise and dirt off of the film and made the colors a lot more vivid and clear.  There are some occasional sound effects added, but they are not intrustive and not that frequent, really.  A couple of scenes in ""Heavy Metal War"", the last episode on the disc, turned out pretty poor, but otherwise they did an awesome job restoring this first season run, even including the original opening of the show and the commercial bumpers.
I am still annoyed by the constant coloring mistakes made by the original animators of the show.  I guess it's part of the charm, and it's probably best that Rhino left them like they were.  I remember these coloring mistakes in the original series just as well, and it even bothered me back then in 1984-85 that Sunbow couldn't seem to tell the difference between Starscream, Thundercracker, and Skywarp most of the time (though as the series goes on past the first 5 or 6, they DO get better about it...save for the part in Heavy Metal War where there are two Starscreams side by side, one of which was supposed to be Skywarp).
I wish Rhino would take out the stupid cartoon openings on their videos and DVDs, though.  While I know they are mostly a children's video company, with things like Transformers and GI Joe, they are mostly catering to adults...adults who don't want to sit through a cartoon rhino dressed like Elvis at the start of each disc while we wait for the menu to appear.
Overall, if you grew up with this original series of Transformers, as I did, you will very much enjoy this set.  I enjoyed every minute of it, and can hardly wait until late November now, where Rhino releases the first half of Season 2 in a box set.  The second half of Season 2 follows in the Spring.
So if you are waiting like I did, stop waiting now.  After watching this, I felt like a kid again, and you will too.",1035417600,12,2315,4.39344262295082
1693633,5,B000063K17,"This DVD is absolutely AWESOME!!!  It brought back memories of my child  hood and I was so happy to see that the last 2 episodes on the DVD's showed the introduction of the ""Insecticons"" and the ""Constructicons"".  This is an absolute must for all Transformers fans and I can't wait for Season 2 to be released in November!!!  The only problem is I think some of the artists were drunk when they wrote these cartoons because I see many many times where the Decepticon planes are colored wrong.  For example, Starscream colored like Thundercracker or Skywarp or vice-versa but this is errors from when the shows originally where on TV, not from the DVD's.  Overall it was worth every penny!!!!",1033084800,4,691,4.716666666666667
1693634,4,B000063K17,"While not the best production to bear the Marvel Productions or Sunbow Productions banner (that would be Dungeons & Dragons and G.I. Joe, respectively), Transformers is by far the most popular Marvel/Sunbow series. So, of course, Rhino knew they'd make a mint by releasing the first season on DVD in its entirety (*and* uncut, unlike the original FHE releases).
Rhino did one better by restoring the series, going for the 35mm source, and the original vocal/sound effects tracks. While the sound is spot on (and actually better, as the ""changes"" reflect effects unearthed in the new mix), the 35mm masters are from the *first* take that Sunbow ordered. In essence, that source has errors that were corrected (or not, depending on the episode's budget) before airing. For the most part, Rhino has corrected these errors using alternative sources (including the suddenly very horrid-looking broadcast master), but they weren't perfect (and the bonus disc manages to catch them with their pants down)-there are additional moments where Starscream, Skywarp, and Thundercracker are miscolored, for instance, and the disappearance of the Decepticon space cruiser in ""More Than Meets the Eye"", Part III. Rhino wanted the best quality possible, as evidenced by a few feats of digital editing where the 35mm master was only slighty ""wrong"".
However, most have noticed the big issues with ""Heavy Metal War"", which has a huge host of ""new"" errors, while still covering up a lot of problems with the 35mm master (the last minute or so of the ep has a good 4 cuts to the broadcast master in order to cover up missing animation, for instance). However, since the ep features the first appearance of the Constructicons (plus a major battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron), we notice the errors that much more. The fact that the three affected scenes are the ones featuring Megatron's challenge of Prime, the power transfer sequence (which Rhino would have been better served by just using the broadcast master for the entire scene, save the few shots that weren't fixed by Sunbow in 1984), and the battle between Prime and Megatron makes it almost unbearable on some level.
Rhino did a great job with the remastering process, even with their mistakes. Of course, Toei's mistakes in processing the animation (most of which are amazingly dumb, especially for such a high quality studio) and the lack of a 35mm master of the corrected episode don't make it any easier for Rhino. One not only hopes for an even better job from Rhino with season 2, one expects it, largely because the re-take budget dwindled to practically zero from that point on as Sunbow's workload increased almost sixfold (as evidenced by the whopping three distinct styles in the animation in Season 2). Regardless, if you like Transformers, you'll probably enjoy this box set.",1032739200,5,2834,5.031914893617022
1693635,5,B000063K17,"Finally, children of the eighties have what we have always wanted-- a faithfully-preserved version of The Transformers television series that we can keep forever!
Rhino's first season of The Transformers is packaged beautifully in a silver case. This edition is obviously meant to appeal to the discriminating DVD collector, with the case including reporduction cels and a detailed booklet with synopses of each episode, not to mention an entire disc full of special features. Make no mistake about it, this is the definitive Transformers season 1!
All of the episodes, 16 in total, have been digitally remastered to preserve as much quality as possible. Some have complained that the sound effects or animation have been altered, but a few sacrifices had to be made in order to preserve the overall quality of the image. If they had used the same film stock that was played on television, the video as a whole would not be worthy of the DVD format (they would have to call it ""Transformers: Grainy""). As for the audio problems, I think most of that stems from the transfer of the audio to Dolby 5.1. It's a simple matter to switch the audio back to Stereo on the menu screen.
Another complaint I have heard is about the animation errors. Those very same errors were in the original series. Rhino is not to be blamed for incidents such as when there are two Starscreams on-screen at the same time, or when Shockwave talks out of Megatron's mouth-- all of the glory of the original show, including the numerous animation gaffes, are maintained here. I feel it was the right decision on Rhino's part, because if they began to tinker to try to fix these glitches, there would have been even more fan outcry. Watching the discs, I believe they truly had the intention of preserving the show in the most faithful way possible-- mistakes and all.
Aside from the few glitches in the presentation, everything else is preserved here. All the action and excitement that we remember from our youth is here and ready to be rediscovered. If you are someone like me, who never grew out of Transformers and remains a devoted Transfan today, or just someone looking for a way to relive their childhood, you will find it easy to sink back into your chair and let the memories wash over you with these skillfully-produced discs.",1032393600,11,2310,4.763092269326683
1693636,5,B000063K17,"YEAH! Im fifteen and have always been facisnated by the transformers series I love them and am always looking for more classics like this one. Like I said before I love the transformers I had alot of the toys when I was like six or seven and have just always loved them. I guess it was the whole storyline about gigantic robots transforming into cars and planes and stuff that inspired alot of people to keep watching.  The series was great but then they made a new one about the auto-bots transorming into animals and I didn't really care for that. I have always been waiting for a DVD boxed set and I'm thrilled to have found this, I hope they keep pushing on into the series. So to those who are doubting or thinking about buying this collection shouldn't have a second thought about it because this is truly ""more than meets the eye"". Happy to hear the legacy is still alive and keep them coming! See Ya Later!",1032048000,,914,4.376470588235295
1693657,5,B000063K17,"When I first heard that this DVD boxed-set had been released, I instantly planned on purchasing a copy of it.  I was 6 years old when the Transformers first aired on television, and I was fascinated with them.  Well it's been 18 years since I've seen those first episodes, and now I've finally gotten another chance!  This set of DVDs took me on a nostalgic trip back to my childhood, where afternoon after-school television was an essential part of every young boy's life.  I put the first DVD in my player, and after just a few seconds into the intro to the first episode, it felt like it was 1984 all over again.  Good old Optimus Prime and Megatron, Autobots and Decepticons, good and evil, battling it out, just like old times. If you're a fan from back in the mid-80's, then you'll really appreciate this set.  If you're a fan of current-day Transformers television series, like Transformers Armada, or if you like the previous Beast Wars series, Beast Machines series, and Robots In Disguise series, you really need to take a look at the Generation 1 series.  Generation 1 is really what it's all about..it's the REAL Transformers series.  All of the series since then don't even compare to the original.  The episodes and Transformers characters that are part of Generation 1 are by far the best of any Transformers series.  The same goes for the Generation 1 toys, but that's a different matter.  There are some audio and coloring flaws and errors present on the DVDs, which many other people have already pointed out on this site.  In retrospect to many of those other peoples' views on the errors and flaws, I think those mistakes can sometimes be quite amusing (Megatron's voice comes from Optimus Prime at least once, Starscream is colored like Skywarp and Thundercracker numerous times, Optimus Prime colored totally blue at least once).  If you haven't seen these episodes in 18 years like I haven't, you probably won't even notice most of the less noticeable errors, and if you do notice them, you likely won't even care.  It's just great to be able to watch these old episodes once again, and in chronological order.  Go ahead and buy this set, you'll really enjoy it!  Then get ready for the DVD set of the first half of Season 2, coming out on November 12, and the second half, scheduled to be released next April.  Watching Season 1 again was very fun and entertaining, and I'll definitely be in line to buy the next two boxed sets as well!
Another original animation error for you Transformer fans to watch for:
In the episode where Skyfire is first discovered under the ice by the Decepticons, scenes of past events prior to the war are shown in which Skyfire and Starscream are scientists that travel to Earth to explore.  In these scenes, Starscream is already shown in an F-15 jet transformation mode.  This could not be, because Starscream was not changed to a jet until after the Decepticons were revived after they crashed to Earth in the Ark, millions of years later.  Also, should Skyfire resemble an Earth jet as well?  Is this another error?",1031702400,,3073,4.69589552238806

Rhino didn't do a good job of cutting out the ""Now back to the Trans-formers"" commercial notifiers. All negatives aside the sound quality is excellent in dolby 5.1 surround sound.

1693663,5,B000063K17,"OK, I'll be the first to admit it - I am not nearly as in tune with The Transformers TV show as I wanted to be growing up WITHOUT A TELEVISION! (pauses as everyone gasps). I must have driven my parents crazy bugging them to buy every comic book and action figure that I could get my hands on though. When I was near a TV (at a friend's house, on vacation or such), however, this was the one show I was sure not to miss under any circumstances. Sometimes I could rent a VCR and some of the episodes were put on Kids Videotape so I could see a few of them otherwise. The Transformers was, in my opinion, the best animated TV series of the 1980's. To have the entire first season on DVD is a real treat. There are 16 episodes in the first season. Apparently, the relatively small number of episodes is due to the fact that the first season aired once a week and not five times a week. I can only imagine how nuts it drove some kids watching The Ultimate Doom for the first time when it kept giving them the ""To be continued"" treatment for three weeks. ;). The remastered version from a technical standpoint does leave a lot to desire. There are scenes that are completely out of sound-synch (like Megatron saying a whole line and his mouth staying wide open the whole time.) Some of the clips were printed in reverse order (ex: one Autobot transforms into a car after the rest transform to robots). And some glitch errors in coloring and appearance do occur: (Starscream colored like Thundercracker, Optimus Prime turning completely blue and my favorite: Soundwave wearing an Autobot symbol ;) ). And age has taken its toll, unabling a crystal-clean transfer from Rhino. There is a noticeable amount of ""dust"" on the episodes. But it's all nitpick. The point you should care about is that it looks much clearer and sounds a lot better than it ever did on network television, and if you were a die-hard of the original series, you won't even care about the aforementioned issues. Rhino has also released each of the volumes separately for purchase, but trust me: THIS is the purchase you want to make. You save more by buying the whole season at once, and a Special Features disc is included so you can see the remastering process, how the transfers compare to the original broadcast, and information about BotCon. But the real cake in this collection are the episodes themselves. This is a must have for anyone who was a true fan of the Transformers. We can only hope that Rhino will see fit to release all of the seasons on DVD soon!
The episodes contained in this season include: More Than Meets The Eye (3 parts), Transport to Oblivion, Roll For It, Divide And Conquer, Fire In The Sky, SOS Dinobots, Fire on the Mountain, War of the Dinobots, The Ultimate Doom (3 parts), Countdown to Extinction, A Plague of Insecticons, Heavy Metal War.",1029888000,2,2839,4.503875968992248
1693664,5,B000063K17,"I will admit, probably like plenty of other past fans of this amazing show, that when that new version came out on Fox, I was extremely excited.  I didn't even think for a second that it could possibly be as horrible as it was, with cheesy lines, moral lessons drenching every episode, and way less [fighting] than the original series.  By the time I was through with one episode, I was shocked and disappointed.  What had happened to Decepticons like Starscream?  Autobots like Hotshot?  Who the heck are these Predicons?  AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DINOBOTS???
I was sad, but then something magical happened.  This DVD came out, and I felt at peace once again.  These sixteen episodes of the first season are incredible, including the original cut-to-commercial sequences and the theme songs for the beginning and end of the episodes.  I am glad they came out with this DVD, because it brought back to the industry what TV has been missing...good TV shows.  I think the only TV show that has remained popular and undaunted by ""hipness"" is The Simpsons.  Still, so many other shows of the past have been left in the dust: Ren and Stimpy, Ghostbusters, GI Joe...etc.  Granted, we have other good new shows like Invader Zim and The Oblongs to make up for what we lost, but there will never be anything like old-school 80's television, and there never will be.
This DVD brought back a taste of the past, and all that we have lost because of the awkward, awful tastes of today's normal television viewer.  LONG LIVE THE AUTOBOTS!",1029628800,,1524,4.684210526315789

1693720,4,B000063K17,"After watching all three of Sunbow's animated series of the mid-80's, I would have to say the best would be Transformers. I say this not for it's high merchandising growth or increased underground popularity, but because it is a cartoon that is appealing to both the lower age audiance and the intelligent audiance making for one great show.
The show starts off with Autobots being intercepted by the Decipticons on their way to Earth to find a new source of energy to make Energon (you'll catch on). Once they arrive on Earth, the Autobots wage a war against the Decepticons who want to plunder the Earth's energy for Energon. Transformers is most entertaining during the battles. Especially when you have so many robots running around with the great voice acting of Scatman Crothers, Peter Cullens, Chris Latta and the amazing Casey Kasem (He played Mark on Battle of the Planets). I'll list a few.
CHARACTERS:
Optimus Prime: Leader of the Autobots and an honorable warrior.
Wheeljack: The mechanic of the Autobots. Has a lot of inventions.
Ratchet: Repairer of the Autobots. Obviously can transform into an ambulance.
Megatron: Leader of the Decepticons. Transforms into a gun.
Starscream: A former-scientist Decepticon who has dreamed of overpowering Megatron since day one.
Soundwave: The most loyal of Megatron's army.
Shockwave: The Decepticon that stayed behind to guard Cybertron.
The DVD has some great picture quality with the addition of some scenes that weren't included in the original broadcast (for better or worse). There are a few problems with the sound but not many. These are the only problems:
-The last couple of episodes on the first disc has the music louder than the voices.
-The second disc doesn't allow you to listen to the original mono soundtrack, but the rest of the discs do.
-The last two episodes have quieter sound-effects on the mono track.
The extras are quite good. They're basiclly lengthy videos of openings, closings, bumpers, cut-animation, comparisons and much more. Probably the best extra would be the Botcon footage where you can get a good idea of how kids grew up with Transformers. The packaging is the best I've seen on a DVD yet. This compact little package folds out to hold four discs and the manual. That's five DVD packages long if you lay it all out. Nice work, Rhino.
Overall, Rhino did an okay job at brining the original series to DVD. So, in other words, it's the original Transformers, it's on DVD, be happy. That's all I can say.
Side Note: One memorable person on the staff is the storyboarder, Peter Chung, who later directed Aeon Flux.",1026950400,,2601,4.913636363636364

The SOUND MIXING/REMIXING (whatever!) in some of the later episodes (including the last 2!) is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! The Voice vs Music vs Sound Effects Balancing is ABHORRENT!!!  In some episodes the MUSIC IS OVERPOWERING THE VOICES (or the voice component is too quiet, take your pick).  This equals hellish viewing!! Almost as annoying are the episodes (LAST 2 of season) where the SOUND EFFECTS are TOO QUIET!! All you hear is the voice track.  If you turn up the volume in a futile effort to compensate, the speech deafens you as your reward!!!!  What does this mean? It means that while the earlier episodes were sound-mixed/remixed well, some later episodes were either completely botched or TOTALLY IGNORED!!!  This set was VERY EXPENSIVE and they cheaped out in many things!!!
So Mr. Wash98c, the sound isn't distracting???

I got no beef with the animation. Besides multiple Starscreams appearing in several episodes and voice-over mistakes and the like, it's quite live-withable.  But the sound in some episodes is ""to die for"" -- literally.  Blahhhhhhhh.

However, after I ordered it, I began reading all of the other reviews and got somewhat nervous about my purchase.  Complaints seem to appear pretty frequently among the reviews, ranging from poor coloring to bad sound effects to miscolored segments.
  I am writing this to help clarify some of the claims and complaints about this DVD set.  I found most of the complaints about the sound and color to be either unfounded or unnoticable.  The colors are bright, impressive, and the sound is not distracting in the least.  In fact, the sound is probably what will stoke the fires of nostalgia the strongest!
  That being said, there is a lot of truth to the fact that Rhino did not seem to take the necessary time to reproduce these beloved cartoons.  I remember a few coloring mistakes from the original series, but this set has more than quite a few!  At times it can be really distracting and irritating, especially since they seem to have dismissed Thundercracker and Skywarp completely, in favor of one Starscream with multiple voices.  It is not something that only the incredibly die-hardest of fans will notice (I have read some of the other reviews, and I am not at all as equally obsessed, but I do have a spot in my heart for the Transformers).
  Overall, I am really pleased to own the set, although I wish the quality had been improved upon.  It is something that can be kind of irritating, but does not take away from the fact that the art is beautifully drawn, the stories more involved than I remembered, and the characters developed astonishingly well for a children's show.

But I'm not sure if Rhino could help this as the originals were in pretty bad shape not just in quality but some of the animators forgot to include things. For the most part though, Rhino did a pretty decent job and the imperfections are really minor especially if you are a fan of the series and want to relive your child hood favorite. But as for being on DVD it isn't anything really special but gets the job done.
The extras disc isn't anything really special either. It describes the processes taken to improve the originals qaulity and transfer legistics to DVD. It also includes anomolies which is kind of fun but the false starts option is a bit repetitive and may make you notious which it also has some from other seasons. But the really cool thing is the fact that you can check out the original Japanese show opening but it may be confusing as things seem very different. If you want to see a script from ""Transport to Oblivion"" you also have that option.
Another plus is the fact that you recieve two animation cells of Rumble and Star Scream in in-show situations. These are nice for collectors and give this collection a nice boost in appeal. The case appearance is also nice but would have been better if it came with a protective case.
All in all a good choice for Transformer fans. The DVD Collector's Edition isn't perfect, the imperfections are minor, but it is nice to relive the memories and have them preserved on DVD, it was well worth my money especially with the addition of the two animation cells.",1024531200,2,2049,4.647382920110193

The worst part though is on the ""Special Features"" disk, they show you side by side clips of the original broadcast and the DVD, you can see all the detail in the original broadcast, but the DVD has completely lost all the transparencies and turned them into pink blobs.

First off, 18 episodes is a large order for any season, and when you consider the breakthrough japanese anime/american comic book style that transformers pioneered, much less the sheer fan/kid feeling of witnessing these shows again, you have great reasons to check these out.
The extras are odd, probably a 3 or 4 if rated away from the set due to their slightly quirky setup... BUT this is a gem of a set even without extras.

If you are a nit-picker, then this DVD set will drive you crazy.  Even some of the mistakes they showcased as being fixed on the special features disc are left in.  Most of the mistakes are:  Optimus Prime being TOTALLY blue in one scene, miscolored Decepticons (Skywarp / Thundercracker / Starscream color schemes seem to be interchangeable with each other or multiplied), and reversed transformations (i.e. should be in robot form, not automobile form).  I never noticed before but a lot of the sounds were swiped from prominent sources.  For example, the Energon cubes being made by Shockwave are tracked to the sound of the turbo lift doors opening in the original Star Trek series.  Also, when Slag (triceratops Dinobot) shoots his three-horned laser blast it tracked to the sound of a light saber opening in Star Wars, and when it hits it sounds like the clash of two light sabers from Star Wars.  Does George Lucas or Gene Roddenbury's estate know of these lifts? Ironic, considering the prominent FBI warning viewers not to steal ""their"" copywrited Transformers stuff.

It is the entire first season of Transformers on a relativly cheap dvd set.  3 whole disc of episodes and one whole disc of extras.
Rhino has gone top notch by cleaning up the video, when they could have just left it alone and no one would complain.  It's almost so natural you may not notice the diffrence, but take a look at the comparison on the dvd extras for proof.
The Audio has be given its polish as well, which again you can observe the diffrence on the comparission extra.
I must mention the box, the case is simple georgous, sporting a hard plastic shell that almost looks metal, opon opening you're shown artwork from the show with Optimus and Megatron, the backing to the cd trays are clear and on the right is an envelope with two cells from the season along with a booklet with an episode guide and a listing of the scenes and episodes on each disc and whats on the extras disc.
On to the episodes - what can you say when there is just an entire disc of extras.  From bumpers from both the american and japanese series to an over 6 minute look at botcon 2001, see the famous transformers convention and if you attended - maybe even see yourself (I did!).  There is a section on the remastering alone so you can see the work that has been done.

  I was so excited to watch Heavy Metal War (HMW) (one of my favorite episodes)... I popped in my DVD and sat back in elated expectation. It took me a few minutes to notice something was wrong. Then it became obvious. I pulled out my old tapped TV episodes and sure enough, HMW was just fine.
  When Prime throws the boulder Megatron disappears- but not in the DVD. Nope, after he vanishes, why he's still there. And the rock lands on him, but he's okay...Rhino should offer an apology and should remaster the remasterings and allow a trade in for people who bought the first set. Oh well, live and learn.

Its great to see it cleaned up and affordable and to watch how the shop started  and then settled into its groove .
I hope the rest of the series comes out in this affordable format or it wouldnt be worth purchasing.  Its funny to watch the animation go from high quality anime'  and suddenly turn into scooby doo quality.

But for the rest like Animation outtakes and anomalies
 it was ok, but quite irritating! They just keep on playing the same thing over and over again.
Also the frame by frame analyst is the same thing if you Press the PAUSE still button on the dvd remote control

I'm 20 years old and still seem to remember every episode of this TV show I saw when I was 5.  This collector set is great and highly recommended...",1022025600,,350,4.2727272727272725
1693804,3,B000063K17,"To say that I love the Transformers is an understatement.  I have every toy, episodes from their original broadcast all the way back to 1984 when I can remember actually recording them, a complete set of the best quality episodes I could find in SP mode on 22 tapes, statues, busts, and too much more to list.  I wanted the episodes on DVD badly.  I instantly ordered the set and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  When the set finally came I immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch the awesome Transformers and see the work Rhino put into the set.  Then my jaw dropped.
They added extra and really stupid sounds into the intro scene, more stupid sounds were edited into the very first scene (along with many scenes in every episode) with Wheeljack and Bumblebee returning to Iacon with the energy conductors they found - the jets (these jets are also seemingly clones since they are all the same color in at least one instance) attack them with what seems to be puny toy lasers making a ""pew pew"" sound more suited to a GI Joe episode (not saying GI Joe is bad, just an animated human rifle sound is the closest I could think of), not Transformer laser rifles.  They have backward transformations in the very first episode let alone all the rest (it's just plain weird to see everybody transforming to car mode when all of a sudden Prowl or any other Autobot transforms from car mode to robot especially when you just saw him as a robot 2 seconds ago), miscolorations of characters - I think Ratchet was colored as Ironhide once, I know Sideswipe and Sunstreaker were switched once, they were also both yellow at one point.  There were also some miscolorations in the original series broadcast such as Prime being all blue in a few instances, which given the amount of hype of remastering I thought they'd fix.  Again I was disappointed.
The only thing I found better than the original broadcasts and worthy of being called remastered, was the color.  As with their other Transformers DVD's they retouched the color very well and made the scenes look pleasant to look at, that is if you got away from the other problems.
Nobody's perfect, but this isn't the first time these episodes have been shown.  I'd expect on a second showing a good bit if not all the mistakes to be fixed especially with how long they were supposedly working on the set.  The old saying - don't fix it if it isn't broke - would have applied here, I'd rather Rhino have just simply put the episodes on DVD without changing, remastering or doing anything, than all the ""oddities"" their fixing created.  There's a 5th disc all ready to go for this set chock full of oddities and anomalies.
Although there are many downsides to this set, I'd still buy it.  I love the Transformers and probably always will.  I hope it's a first run through and they'll fix and re-release it, or at least do better on subsequent seasons.  Until they release the other seasons or re-release the first, I'll just make my way through this one.

There are soo many mistakes that should have been fixed before recording. That's just my opinion. Below are some which I have spotted.

Iron Hide Shown transforming into car twice when Autoots return home after optimus loses to Megatron.
When ground is broken by Sludge no lava comes up but in old episodes there are.
No smoke comes out of Scrapper when Snarl shoots him with his tail.

1693838,4,B000063K17,"Of course, this is a great set.  Some have complained that the colors aren't wholly accurate and that Rhino took the liberty of recoloring everything. This doesn't seem to make sense; who would go through the trouble of recoloring every single cell and background painting for a DVD collection?  It may seem that Rhino took the original print and oversaturated it a bit with color, but one could argue that this was the animators' original intent.  There are a couple of glitches involving reversed tranformations or post-production effects (Autobots reacting to invisble explosions, or certain energon cubes not ""glowing"".)  But all in all, the video is noticeably improved.
Now, the bad part. Rhino decided to add these really irritating sound effects, with little to no consistency, at that.  It's almost as though they were really enthusiastic about adding these sound effects at the beginning, but this petered off towards the last couple episodes.  They sound as though they were ripped off some cheesy sound effects CD (little surprise, as Rhino also distributes a lot of Cartoon Network/Hanna Barbera stuff), and it all just sounds wholly inapprorpiate.  They're also really loud, which makes you especially conscious of them.  There doesn't appear to be a way to turn them off, either; I would have been satisfied if the Dolby 2.0 channel just didn't include them (after all, they're just part of a ploy to say that they boasted Dolby 5.1), but nope, such was not the case.
The extras are a nice little set - a couple nitpicks about the overlong editing and weird DVD interface, but overall, Rhino did a great job.  I'm curious to see how/if they handle the 2nd season, as it contains quite a few more episodes than the first one.",1021248000,,1739,4.907849829351536

1693840,1,B000063K17,"This relese by Rhino is a total failure, but will do for now.
If you have never watched Transformers, you may not notice that much, but if you are a fan, you'll hate this release.

Rhino has added annoying sound effects which are totally out of place. Colours have been changed, which is pretty stupid, but the thing which gets on my nerves the most is the way Rhino has changed entire scenes, such as the scene in 'The Heavy Metal War'
when Spike says ""they don't call those creeps Decepticons for nothing"" if you have the original VHS tapes(not Rhino's release)check the difference in Spike's face. Another very noticable difference is the way Megatron lands when he has come to talk to Prime in 'The Heavy Metal War'. In the same episode again Ironhide transforms from robot to van, instead of from van to robot, which looks stupid, since he suddenly appears in robot-mode straight after.

If you like the original, don't buy this. I thought that the cybernet space cube was bad enough, but this is terrible.

Having said that, I also think that it is good that Transformers is finally released on DVD in its entirety and you can switch to 2.0  for the original soundtrack without the annoying sound effects. But I still wish the animation wasn't played around with. I'd rather a poor picture quality of something in its original form than perfect picture quality, but been messed up in so many ways.

The best thing about this DVD set is the bonus Japanese bumpers and Japanese show opening.

I suppose this is still worth buying seeing it is the only complete and in chronological order release of the transformers. If you do not nit pick over minor details, then this is a must have. It is still fun to watch.

I only give this item a 1 star because it was not released in its original form, and I hope Rhino doesn't take this personnal, but people want their favourite shows released as they were originally aired. Please no more 5.1 channel on something that was originally in mono or stereo.

and pieces of unused leftover video.

several errors on these DVD's that were not on the original VHS

notice these mistakes, just take a look at the other reviews!
In particular I notice the guy in the wheelchair at the end of Heavy Metal Wars rolls smoothly down a vertical drop !
The picture does not look clean!
it looks like a dirty old cinema reel that hasn't been used
for 20 years! I don't believe this has been restored at all!
As for the sound it just doesn't fit!
The cartoon did have a genuine 80's feel to it originally!
But now Rhino have added loads of random tacky sounds everywhere!
The extra's om Disc 4 are boring, repetitive and just plain bad!

This boxed set is a perfect collection for the male in the mid-20's as it helps you re-live what may have been some of the best times of your life.  It's fun going back and seeing the animation errors (where Starscream changes colors and looks like skywarp or decepticon symbols turning red or Huffer taking Optimus' trailer when he's damaged and 3 seconds later you see Optimus driving off with the trailer etc)  But the eternal battle of good vs. evil is masterfully portrayed.  It is lacking special features, but the fact that they do make use of dolby digital 5.1 (even though it could use some work) is pretty cool.  This is a must-have for any U.S. cartoon collector who liked Thundercats, Robotech, Starblazers, Voltron, and Mask.

Of the extras included in this set, I must praise Rhino for their inclusion of nearly *every* opening sequence for the show, missing only the original second season opening and that of ""The Rebirth"" but I was very pleased to find the inclusion of the rare ""Five Faces of Darkness"" mini-series opening, which even the original FHE VHS release of the episode doesn't contain.
Of course, there are those who won't buy this set because of the fact it isn't presented *exactly* as it was back in 1984, but as a longtime Transformers fan who has eagerly awaited this release, I was *not* disappointed in the least. Should Rhino see fit to release DVD sets for the remaining episodes, I certainly won't hesitate to place an order.

Thundercats gets a slot on Cartoon Network.  G.I. Joe also has some episodes coming out on Rhino with a new comic also out.  But no other show from the 80's has done what the Transformers have done.
Not only have they come back out on video with Rhino, and come out with a new comic series; Transformers also enjoys success with many recent offshoots (Beast Wars and many other Japanese for starters), yearly conventions, and a fan base as large if not larger than what it had in the 80's. If you've been keeping track of this phenomenon, you don't need me telling you how great Transformers are.
For those fans, this set is truly a dream come true.  Not only does this set have 16 original episodes from the 80's (the whole first season) in chronological order (unlike Rhino's previous releases), the extras are fantastic!  The video looks better than ever.  Audio has been upped to Doby 5.1.  The extra disk has all the extra's a TF fan could want (as listed under the Edition Details.
If you're a Transformer fan, you don't need me telling you that this DVD collection is a dream come true.  You already know.  I personally just can't wait until the next season comes out.",1020556800,,1331,4.625531914893617

1693908,3,B000063K17,"I have mixed feelings about Rhino's DVD Set of Transformers Season 1. The colors are vivid, and the audio is enhanced in many areas, to include most of the ""Transformer Bumpers"" throughout the set. Rhino turned mono into stereo. The 4th CD has a lot of goodies, including extensive information on how the episodes were restored from 35 MM film from the 1980's. Rhino did a wonderful job enhancing and cleaning up the images. However, the only downside is that Rhino made noticeable coloring errors in the restorations. I have the ""Family Home Entertainment"" (f.h.e) episodes of the Transformers from the 1980's so I was able to make some comparisons. On the DVD set, you'll notice that Starscream, Thundercracker and Skywarp sometimes interchange their colors, even during the same scene. At one point, for a few seconds, Cliffjumper had Bumblebee's colors. Bumblejumper? These coloring errors are not present in the VHS episodes, so it's my guess that Rhino re-colored the Transformer episodes as part of the restoration, making a few errors. In conclusion, the DVD set is a nice addition, but it won't make you overly happy if you are a video purist.",1020384000,9,1152,4.974093264248705
1693909,2,B000063K17,"Rhino's careless and unworthy handling of the immensly popular ""Transformers"" license is never more apparent than in the Season One box set.
I gave it two stars because they only did two things right.  One was the packaging, which they smartly decided not to do artwork for the covers and went with the plain brushed metal look.  They must have learned something from the horrible packaging from the previous DVDs and videos they produced.  Second they retained the original commercial bumpers.
My main problems with the DVDs is their supposed remastering.  The sound effects they added are distracting, sometimes drowning out what characters are saying.  Plus, anyone who knows the cartoons knows that those sound effects aren't authentically original.  They don't add anything to the presentation and only give Rhino a blurb to put on the packaging.
The biggest mistake Rhino made with this set is the recoloring.
Everyone knows that the first season was already riddled with animation, voice, and color errors, but did Rhino fix any of these things?  No, they added to them!  In one shot they color Trailbreaker (a black pickup) completely red.  In another scene Skyfire(a white jet) is colored with Skywarp's color scheme(a black and purple jet).
It's funny cause in the side by side comparison extra you can see that colors and effects were correct in the original.  Rhino shows that they can change the colors at will, but neglected to fix any of the original errors, i.e. Optimus Prime being blue in a scene from S.O.S. Dinobots.
There are too many mistakes Rhino has engraved into the Transformers video library to name here.  I just emplore Rhino to not take this valuable license for granted and be a little careful and mindful of the material and fans when releasing future seasons.",1020297600,12,1793,4.963210702341137

If you're anything like me, once you see the opening of the first show, you'll instantly be transported back to that 1984 Saturday morning state of mind. Having not seen these shows for years, I was surprised that much of the artwork was as good as I remembered it. The only drawback is the many errors (coloring, voice overs, etc.) present within each episode. Whether the majority were present in the original cells or a result of Rhino's tampering is difficult to tell. Still, it is kind of funny to hear Megatron's voice comming out of Prime's mouth!

I can remember coming home from school to watch the Decepticons beat the [stuffing] out of the Autobots.....you can see which side I prefered! But seriously, if you were a fan of the Transformers and owned many of the toys like I did (mine are still in the garage in perfect condition) then this is the ultimate DVD for you to purchase!
  The sound quality is superb (surround sound) despite the fact that did not exist in the mid 80's. In my opinion, every guy ages 21-30 (who grew up in this time period) should own this set because lets face it....next to GI JOE, the transformers were the ultimate toys to own back then!  Boy, it must [stink] to grow up now a days without good toys such as the transformers!! ha ha

For instance, you'd get two episodes from season with an episode from season 3 on the same tape. Well, they listened to the gripes, and decided instead of releasing the episodes chronologically, they'd release them season by season! This first (and hopefully not last) season DVD boxed set is astonishing. It comes with 4 discs, the first three contain the first 16 episodes, while the 4th contains special features, such as comparisons between the original 35mm and remastered prints, outtakes, frame by frame animation, and more shocking was the opening credits of the Japanese Transformer show VICTORY. It even had a couple of minutes from an episode of Transformers: Super God Masterforce dubbed in English!

Of course, the original episodes were not in surround sound as the technology didn't exist in the mid 80s, but the DVD enhancement is amazing. There are crashes of thunder, claps of sound, and tremendously powerful blasts that make these episodes even more enjoyable to watch, nostalgia not withstanding. The picture enhancement is equally enjoyable. You really do need to watch these in full 5.1 surround sound mode for the ultimate enjoyment of this boxed set!

The overall image quality has definetly been improved: brighter colours, sharp images and heavy remastering (scratch removal, ect.) but WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?? They really made some devastating mistakes! Some scenes are played in reverse (i.e. the infamous Ironhide transformation scene from 'Heavy Metal War'), some visual heat-, smoke- and fire-effects are just missing!! And there is this mistake-documentation which should show the people what errors the original film masters had and that they have been corrected... they found the errors, but forgot(?) to correct many of them.
Sharpness and colour of the image deserve 5 STARS, but in fact of the errors 2 STARS is the proper rating!
SOUND QUALITY (2/5 STARS)
Generally the sound is very clear and free of hiss/crackles but WHAT HAVE THEY DONE...AGAIN?? They have remixed the soundtrack to Dolby Digital 5.1, initially that sounds brilliant but to reach this goal Rhino added some really strange&stupid soundeffects. Ok, the explosions have a great *boom* but gunfire sounds like children toy guns.
The Dolby Stereo soundtrack is another mess, some episodes have the new 5.1 remix simply downmixed to stereo, but others have the original soundtrack with no added effects. I believe every fan of the series demands at least an option to hear the original sountrack!
First a disappointment then you (have to) get used to it. Nothing more and nothing less.
EXTRAS (5/5 STARS)
The extras is the real strenght of this set! I wonder why they have used so much from season 2 and 3. Can it be that they already have used up all their resources?
SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:
- all new transfer from the original 35mm negative
- Dolby Digital 5.1 remix & Dolby Stereo
- extras... more than meets the eye
- 2 limited-edition cels of Transformers characters (limited?? just to the availability of this boxset LOL!)
COMMENT:
I am a great fan of Transformers G1 and I would have loved to see the TFs in its original form, without remastering mistakes and additional soundeffects.
As a Transfan I also bought the UK boxset of season 1 which contains a lot of other worthy extras. The picture quality is not so sharp and brilliant but there are NO MISTAKES and errors. The soundtrack is the 5.1 remix from this US boxset.

Another sad thing is how the Deceptacons were shown in such a negative light. . . they were people too (well at least they were robots). The economic havic wreaked on earth was evident. Metal is expensive and should not be wasted on animated robots. Considering the size of the Autobots compared to the humans in the series, it isn't hard to find that the use of that amount of metal would force the people of earth to use plastic which is bad for the environment because it isn't bio degradable. Buying this series on DVD promotes the destruction of our environment and the release of dangerous greenhouse gasses.

It spawned a few sub series, a massive toyline, and a feature length movie....so this DVD set isn't too much of a surprise.

Joe, Battle of the Planets, etc.), this dvd collection has been well over due. Finally we get to see Transformers, digitally restored and in its glory with extras that will keep you wanting more.

Of course, the Batman cartoon is one exception.

The day has finally come when I can retire my old tapes where I used to sit and tape every episode of TF's.
I have bought every other TF's VHS and DVD that Rhino has made.. along with the G.I. Joe and I just hope that will will allow me to retire those tapes as well.  After 17 years they were starting to get a bit too blury and faded to watch.",1017532800,,379,3.8461538461538463

The Transformer television shows are only vague memories to me and I CAN'T wait to have all those memories rush over me.  Having an entire season at my finger tips is wonderful and the DVD revolution has allowed this to happen without taking up shelves and shelves of space with VHS tapes!

Silverhawks, Transformers, Robotech, Gi-JOE, He-Man, and a few others are the cartoons that molded the children of the late 70's. I am now 25 and all I can say that I am buing this for memories as much as I am buing it for one of the best cartoons ever made! I will agree that transformers is not Robotech quality but so many great stories of courage and friendship what else can you ask for! Now all we need is GI-JOE, and the rest of the ""V"" Series of TV and Movies to come in to DVD!!!!!!",1017014400,2,618,4.115702479338843

I was raised on this stuff (and FLINTSTONES-- hint hint --release this on DVD too please!) My goodness, Transformers was wonderful.  Ah, the memories. The BEAUTIFUL MUSIC played in the background was so uplifting and carried the show to greatness (to Godhood!). The character VOICES, my word, they were UNFORGETTABLE. The sheer HEROSHIP of it all, the BATTLE between GOOD and EVIL at its FINEST.  Wonderfully evil STARSCREAM and the TYRANT MEGATRON that tolerated him. And the GLORIOUS DINOBOTS... they were incredible. GRIMLOCK was OVER-THE-TOP HILARIOUS...I loved him to death.  And let's not forget the whole theme of the show, the TRANSFORMING, the sound effects and the VISUAL SPLENDOR that accompanied it.  GLORY TO RHINO for this creation of ""Big-Bang"" proportions, and GLORY TO YOU who LOVED it as much as anyone could love an animated show based on friendly, talking cars warring with their counterpart talking, morally-challenged and sometimes misunderstood air and jetplanes, and the BIG GUN who led them, while mostly to RETREAT and DEFEAT, still all managed to have the TIME OF THEIR LIVES doing it.",1016841600,6,1220,5.27319587628866
1694065,5,B000063K17,"I've been waiting so long for this day to happen.  The Transformers complete first season on DVD.  This was the most amazing cartoon I had ever seen while growing up.  I was nine years old when the Transformers debuted in 1984 on Saturday mornings. I had my mom set the alarm clock ten minutes before six o'clock to make sure I didn't miss the begining of it.  I only wished I still had all my original toys.  The entire story line is brilliantly written. The heroic Autobots, lead by there leader, Optimus Prime versus the evil Decepticons, lead by there leader, Megatron.  It shows the true meaning of the phrase ""It's good vs. evil"".  I'm hoping that they continue to release all the Transformers seasons on DVD until the very last episode.  Just like the recently released Robotech series.  The Transformers were, and still is, my favorite cartoon and toy ever!!  I have never stop thinking about Transformers even to this day.  It is a must have for everyone!!  Buy this DVD!! It is MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE!!!!!!!!!!",1016668800,90,1021,4.64245810055866

To be honest, I never thought this would happen. Like many others (it appears), I wrote SOOOO MANY E-mails to RHINO asking them to do something like this I could not begin counting them.... And SURPRISE !! Here it is !!! WOW ! I really hope RHINO will also think of finishing the Inhumanoids they started and release the last 4 episodes of the series on 1 DVD. I especially hope they will do ALL of the Transformers SERIES this way and I hope they'll do FULL Jem & G.I. Joe DVD box sets as well,... OH... And Visionaries too ! ;:-)",1016668800,,551,4.3076923076923075

I remember the titanic struggle between the Heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Remembering being wowed by every episode, the way they could change from vehicles and robots and vice versa. The storeies. It was great. I lost count as to how many of the toys I had as a result.
Even now, I still feel a sense of wonder when I watch reruns whenever they appear. So I am happy that they are being released on DVD.",1016236800,,528,4.343434343434343

  Now here we are in the new millenium, and we have the first season of Transformers on DVD which includes 16 episodes of Autobots and those evil Decepticons.  One of the fondest memories I have was the sound of the robots transforming.  Hearing this again brought back some great memories.

To be able to watch Optimus Prime and Megatron battle it out again after all these years. I do not think that there has been a more enjoyable cartoon released to date. I have preordered a couple sets, one for me and one for my brother, and can only hope that Rhino will release the other seasons, and maybe if they have enough success from this might release other cartoons such as GI Joe in a similar format.
