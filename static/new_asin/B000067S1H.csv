1719303,5,B000067S1H,"Bummer!  But somehow, the marketing guru's behind one of the absolute best running dramas in the history of television know what they're doing by keeping us waiting.  The DVD release is timed to coincide with season 4 airing on HBO.  There are some true genius moments in season 3 that are not to be missed.  The episode where Paulie and Christopher get lost in the woods while Tony's girlfriend Gloria is freaking out on him, shows Tony at the brink of truly losing control- of himself, his life, his very identity.  A masterpiece of an episode.  If I'm not mistaken, it was directed by Steve Buscemi. But don't forget, this was also the season that saw the crazy Burt Young character make that unforgettable hit, Dr. Melfi get raped, Ralphie kill his dancer girlfriend, Jackie Jr. get whacked and Carmella finally reconcile her full involvement in Tony's way of life after the shrink she sees in desperation tells her to leave him now. (Of course, she doesn't) WOW! What a season.  Don't miss this DVD collection. I won't.",1024531200,6,1024,4.719101123595506
1719304,5,B000067S1H,"This season really focuses on Tony & Carmela's role as parents. The gangster plotlines take a backseat to Mr. & Mrs. Soprano's slow awareness that the future they hoped to provide for their children is something of a delusion.
Story lines move in unexpected ways, and some episodes really need to be viewed more than once in order to fully comprehend (Univesity, Fortunate Son).  There are some great new characters (Gloria Trillo, Ralph Cifaretto, & Burt Young as a mean old brute, chain-smoking his way through lung cancer), but the main characters have new life breathed into them.  Paulie Walnuts, always great comic relief, begins to show a darker side.  And Christopher, now a Made Man, has grown into a genuine threat.
By the season finale the characters have evolved in ways that leave them at odds in ways they've never been before.
This is my favorite season yet. Very rich, thought provoking, and in the end pretty frightening. My fav. episodes: Army of One (the finale), Pine Barrens (Tony needs to keep an eye on those 2!), & Employee of the Month.",1022371200,22,1061,4.786885245901639
1719305,5,B000067S1H,"The Sopranos broke it's own record! 9 million people saw the Season 2 finale, which was the largest audience for a single show (none sporting event) in cable history... until now. 11.3 million people tuned in to see the Season 3 premier. This is a great accomplishment, since HBO has 33 million subscribers. (I am sure that they did not count all those people with illegal cable)

1719306,3,B000067S1H,"The third season of the Sopranos was a season of searching. I think that the story was basically wrapped up at the end of season 2 and the producers and writers had to come up with new story lines to carry the series. They come up with a new adversary for Tony, who I don't think is as focused or as threatening as Jackie was. They try to increase the focus on Meadow, to limited effectiveness. Christopher, who I think is one of the best characters on the show, gets much less air time and I think that's a mistake. While the first two seasons managed to balance both of Tony's ""families"", I don't think they were as successful at the juxtapositioning of his responsiblities in season 3.
Don't get me wrong, I still think it's the best show on television, but it's not as strong as the previous seasons. I remember thinking that the best thing about the season opening 2 hour episode was how they blended ""Every breath you take"" with ""Peter Gunn"". That should not be the thing that is the most memorable from the show. Unlike the previous seasons, they suffer from a lack of focus. It felt like they were feeling their way around for a story. They left so many loose ends, to be worthy of a soap opera, not a drama.
Anyway, I'll be picking it up anyway and I've got my fingers crossed that season #4 will return the series to its former glory.",1022112000,7,1344,4.337301587301587
1719307,5,B000067S1H,"It's a sad fact of life, but many great things must, by law of averages, become a shadow of their former selves. The Simpsons, Fraiser and many other examples of great TV all have succumb to competition, ratings and a lack of spark and ideas. Fortunately, this does not apply to the Sopranos. It just keeps getting better and better. This may seem impossible, considering the last two season were a perfect blend of dark comedy, affectionate and studied family drama and superb characterisations and plot devices, but, yes, this is about as good as it gets. Instead of losing its dark heart and compelling juxaposition of graphic (but purposeful) violence, family life, character sympathy and graphic sex, this third season goes further, darker and deeper. Plus the creators use the show's popularity and audience's trust as a green light to be more experimental, breaking the structures of normal drama and pushing the moral restains of television. I can go on all day about the great storylines, the convincing and surprising twists and turns, the note perfect performances, the script etc... but I won't - watch this. If you haven't seen one episode, drop everything now and go watch them. As for other fans - I want season four and I want it now.",1021852800,4,1250,4.845794392523365
1719308,5,B000067S1H,"The third series of 'The Sopranos' consolidates the brilliance of the first two, rather than taking it in any radically new directions.  The characters, their relationships and their environment are so strong; the dramatic irony between our sympathy with and enjoyment of these people, and our knowledge of their brutal and unhypocritically presented crimes, is so complex, that any blatant originality merely for the sake of it would be a betrayal.
But, because the central components are so strong, there is plenty of room for play - in the way narratives are set up to encourage then defy expectations; in the interplay with canonical gangster texts, especially 'The Godfather'; in the consistently creative use of music - for mood and to emphasise character, yes, but also to create ironic distance, to add montages of 'commentary' over the stories, to connect apparently disparate scenes, to add a depth of texture.  Because it is in texture that 'The Sopranos' has really developed - the recklessly confident film-making; the layered scripts; the rich dialogue; and the knowing acting combine to create programmes of truly, yes, operatic density.
There are a number of new plot developments in this series - Meadow goes to Columbia University; the FBI (in a supremely funny handful of episodes) attempt to bug the Sopranos; the Russian mafia grow in menacing importance; Janice takes up with a Christian musician; Anthony Jr. becomes increasingly unmanagable at school and at play, but proves an unexpectedly skilful footballer; Ralph (Joe Pantoliano) replaces Richie Aprile as the major made-guy thorn in Tony's side; Carmela feels increasingly guilty about her mob-financed luxury; Tony begins an affair with a beautiful, smart, successful car saleswoman (Anabella Sciorra) who has even more mental problems than he.  Most crucial for the series is the role of Jackie Aprile Jr., college-mitching son of Tony's former mob boss and best friend, who wants to see some of the criminal action, and starts dating Meadow as a spectacularly misjudged entree.  The major weakness of the second series - the tokenistic continuation of the Dr. Melfi framing scenes long after they've outrun their dramtic usefulness - is corrected by both bringing the psychotherapist (dangerously) closer to Tony's life, and by having Carmela join in the sessions, to comic effect.
There is a brooding, elegiac feel to the series, with Tony thinking not just about his mother, but his dead friends, Pussy's actions in the last series, and the future possibilities open to the younger generation.  If nothing else, Series 3 boasts the best-ever episode of 'The Sopranos', directed by one Steve Buscemi, which begins farcically, with Paulie and Christopher accidentally killing an irate Russian, and bungling the disposal of his body in a snow-wasted forest; before turning into a nightmare, as they lose their bearings after the corpse runs off, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere.  Loosened from the secure ties and identity-affirmation of family and Family, the episode brilliantly encapsulates what's at stake in the series, as unforgettably as the immortal 'Seinfeld' episode when the quartet can't find their car in the shopping mall car park.",1021852800,284,3241,5.259187620889748

1719411,4,B000067S1H,"Although this remains one of the best series ever produced in terms of character development and content, this particular season is not as strong as season 1 and 2. Many of the major storylines from the past seemed to have been abandoned or not further developed, leaving gaps. The writing is not as strong, and the pace has slowed a bit. I certainly have not lost interest in the show, but I miss the level of intensity of the past two seasons. Never the less, one of the the best I've watched. I was too young when this originally aired to appreciate the show, but now, as an adult, I understand why the critical acclaim for this was so high.",1484870400,,644,4.375

1719444,5,B000067S1H,This is a clasic now available for streaming from Amazon and I highly recommend that you begin with Season One.  It is a story of organized crime as existed in the final decades of the 20th Century.  It is superbly acted but the violence is quite graphic and not intended for young viewers.  There is considerable nudity and the language is foul but fits the story.  I don't recommend binge viewing as you will begin to think and talk like them!  Three episodes at the time was all we could stand.,1484006400,,497,4.417582417582418

The first episode with the FBI infiltration, complete with hip spy music, takes a look at the series from a different perspective.  Of course, the introduction of Ralphie into the series is vastly important, considering how much influence the character ends up having on many plot lines.  We also see the story of Jackie Aprile, Jr. which has nice ups and downs.  And of course, you have to get to the last episode but Uncle Junior actually sings and man, what a talent, seriously.

But the ONLY way I think Tony S. could have/should have been on the ""sleeping with the fishes"" list would be at the hands of one that had to take him out to claim his wife as his own. NOT by a crazy Sister or Mob Boss....not even prison. BUT if Furio did that it really would have been an epic ending of the show. As it was left we expected a Movie to wrap up loose ends...hell have Carmella go to Italy to find Furio even how great that would be...b/c no matter how likeable Tony is he was a horrible husband....and Carm deserved better.",1471219200,,853,4.175757575757576

1720070,5,B000067S1H,"I'm biased,  I loved the Sopranos when it originally aired,  watching it again is such a guilty pleasure.

I have always liked wise guy movies and this series allows me to see how the underworld lives.

First makes sure you watch seasons 1 and 2 in order to understand what progresses during this season.
A lot of changes occur for the New Jersey crime mob in season 3.  I don't want to give too much away.  The main characters begin to examine the lives they lead, the things they've done and the impact it makes on their families.  Dr. Malfi struggles with her professional balance regarding Tony.

We like it for all of the reasons everyone else does. The actors bring the characters to life, the story line is fascinating, the writing and character development is superb. It is not only entertaining, but on so many levels, the topics it addresses are all conversation starters. Story lines, the flow of everyday life within the main life style, gets the audience to think, question, cry, laugh-relate to our common ""human-ness"".

1720847,4,B000067S1H,This is a very interesting program and very captivating. It is however very violent and makes me uneasy to watch it. I can only take it in small doses. I think it is less fictional than I would like. Then there is the issue of whether watching this numbs a person to the reality of life in this country and allows people to turn a blind eye to corruption and murder. It would seem that the system of the mafia as portrayed here resembles our current corrupt political system. That is scary.,1454284800,,490,4.336956521739131

1721008,5,B000067S1H,"Only a ""Wise Guy"" would rate this anything less than FIVE STARS!  Season three has some great story lines with the Feds pushing harder than ever to wire tap Tony and the ever unpredictable and erratic behavior of Tony's crew.  This season has two notable arcs, the violent and insane behavior of Ralph Cifaretto and the struggle of Christopher to get his feet on the ground as a newly made man.  I could do without the storylines involving Meadow and her college experience but it does serve to round out the aspects of Tony's family aside from the ""Family Business.""",1447977600,,567,4.65

Ralph continues to be a problem that won't go away, forcing the viewer to wonder how Tony will handle him. Tony's decision comes as a surprise to even himself, showing him to be a character with complex strategic skills.

I didn't have the time to watch it when it was originally on, but streaming it has made it possible to savor the show together with my wife on our timeline and enjoy it together.  We are currently half way through season 6 and without knowing how it is going to wind up, the show has held steady in its quality and delivering consistent quality.  I went into the show intent to watch it with my wife thinking it was something she would enjoy more and I would like but not think of as great.  Thankfully I was wrong and we both love it and think it is a great show.  It is intense from season to season and delivers great entertainment.  Some serious stereotypes but overall it is Hollywood not the history channel so all things considered I think it is a great show and am enjoying it and am sure will miss seeing new episodes as I finish up the final season.

The old man's delivery and his voice are simply magnificent, and quite unexpected. Then that little whiny POS Meadow starts throwing bread and half sings ""Oops I did it again.""

The late James Gandolfini is superb in his role as Tony Soprano, with terrific performances also by Edie Falco (as his wife Carmela).

1722287,4,B000067S1H,"What can you say about the Sopranos which hasn't already been said a thousand, thousand times. Now, looking back on it from the perspective of passing time, it is still good, not great but good. Good solid writing. Writers who could hold a show together and keep it going when other writers can't even keep a show going for three or four years. James Gandolfini is the heart of the show and the show itself. I am not taking anything away from the supporting cast because that would false. They all made the show work. However, James Gandolfini possessed the role of a lifetime and created a living, breathing character. He made you care about him even though he was an anti-social, sociopathic and possibly psychotic individual. He could get all maudlin about baby ducks in his swimming pool and yet  kill someone without remorse. And the writers handled it realistically; they made it work in the Gandolfini character. So, for a show with a good story well written and beautifully realised characters, The Sopranos is worth the time to watch.",1414540800,,1043,4.762430939226519

1722523,5,B000067S1H,"In my opinion, this is the best series ever made. Only such great shows as Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones can even come close. The Sopranos shows the life of fictional mob boss Tony Soprano, expertly played by James Gandolfini. It shows Tony the mob boss, but also Tony the family man. With a wife and 2 children he has some of the same problems faced by ordinary people.

My favorite episodes of The Sopranos: Season 3 were:

Pine Barrens - Paulie and Christopher get lost in the woods in an area called Pine Barrens after a collection attempt from a Russian thug goes horribly wrong. Paulie and Christopher try to survive the freezing cold overnight by eating ketchup packets found in a truck. This is a really powerful episode which shows the dangers of dealing with the Russian mob.

Mr. Ruggiero's Neighborhood - this episode deals with the FBI and their ongoing attempt at surveillance of Tony Soprano. While the episode is fictional, it is based on real life tactics used by the FBI. A facinating episode to watch. This is the opening episode of Season 3.

This season was one of my favorites.",1409875200,,1101,4.6020408163265305

1722585,5,B000067S1H,"I wanted to finish the series before rating it.  I had a very mixed experience.  On the one hand, Tony's callous thuggery in the name of ""business"", such a major part of the first two seasons, makes him a very unappealing character, and this remains through season 3.  I watched the whole series over the course of two weeks, and I found my mood suffered as a result.  The writers create a sense of urgency for him to deal with himself through the device of the panic attacks.  So, backwards from Walt White in Breaking Bad, the normal guy science teacher who becomes a drug lord, the theme that kept me watching this despite the discomfort was Tony's periodic confrontations with who he is.  Melfi and Carmella help a lot with this, especially Dr. Melfi.  Overall, the acting is superb.

This series is no mere ""Godfather"" saga, which takes place on the screen.  The Sopranos provides a nuanced, if unappealing mirror in which to consider oneself as a family member and member of society.",1408665600,,989,4.637931034482759

The introduction of Ralph and the development of Jackie Jr. is fantastic.  For a long time this used to be my favorite season of them all, and watching it again I have to agree. It starts with the tension filled yet fun to watch Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood. It has the classic episode 6 - University where Ralph's relationship with a Bada Bing Dancer develops poorly.  There is the great flashback episode (""...To Save us All from Satan's Power"") where Bobby Bacala is enlisted to play Santa Clause.  Plus it has the single best episode of the Sopranos: Pine Barrens. The final episode sees the fate of Jackie Jr. decided and treats us to the amazing singing of Dominic Chianese (who plays Corrado Junior Soprano). Plus, it ends with the introduction of a new friend for Adirana which will develop in the next season. As always, incredible acting, incredible story, and incredible dialogue. After all these years, The Sopranos still stands out as the best TV has to offer.",1406073600,,1161,4.676470588235294

You just know it's coming!  Great writing, great acting, great characters, but still a bit too much of Dr. Melfi's psycho-babble. She knows Tony is a psychopath, realizes she's not going to help him, but she is in denial about it because she has become transfixed with his deep well of dysfunctional psychological water that stimulates her physically and mentally.  Tony has become Dr. Melfi's bad habit that she can't cut loose, despite all around her telling her to do so. Dr. Melfi is in rebellion from her own reality; yeh, yeh, we get it.  So Tony, let's get back to hitting people in creative ways and corrupting elected officials. Great show!",1403136000,,881,4.769736842105263

1723221,3,B000067S1H,It's just a story of the underworld characters. The introduction of the emotional side of people mixed with sanity makes for a lot of confusion and unlikelyhood mixed with reality is not believable. Tough guy movie ....EH.,1403049600,,222,5.027027027027027

The characters are people who would and literally do kill each other and then go to dinner with the survivors. Some are likeable at times but it doesn't last when their true nature comes out. There is a reason this show ran on HBO for six years, it's very well done, I think you will enjoy it as I have.

Don't know what it is that attracts us so to these gangster movies.  All the characters were well developed with major character flaws for the most part.  The only one I could have done without was Tony's sister Janice, such a whining scheming shrew with a remarkably ugly mouth both literally and figuratively.  Didn't much care for the shrink either, zero personality IMO..  Edie Falco, fabulous range of emotion and attitude.

(Apparently I do)

One of the great all time tv shows-- HBOs tale of a messed up modern mob family in New Jersey has made it to Amazon Instant Video- and it's uncut enough to have brief partial nudity.

Lying, stealing, cheating and prone to intense violence, a fast paced show, perfect for binge watching, these likable psychopaths are worth watching.",1401926400,,392,4.6521739130434785

Seasons 1 and 2 have subtitles. Seasons 4, 5, and 6 have subtitles. Also, in the description of the features, on all of these copies at the line ""Languages"" they will state ""Subtitled,"" or add a line and state: ""Subtitles: English, French and Spanish."" Season 3 does not. I returned the package to Amazon and asked for a replacement. They provided a replacement... of the same, without subtitles.  I returned my copy, complained and they sent a replacement... of the same. I complained by phone, they apologized, returned my money and ended the case. I still do not have Season 3 with subtitles. Now I'm waiting for the DVD's to arrive at Walmart. They advertised specifically with subtitles.

Update 14 days later: Went to Walmart to pick up my order. Same DVD, same case, same result. It seems that the powers that be have issue a number of DVDs without subtitles and forgot about the people who need them.

How to identify the copies without subtitles: Nowhere will they have printed the word ""Subtitled."" Look at the back of the box. You will see at the right side the bar code label. On top you will find the numbers 0-7831-1983-6. At the center they have located the box where the languages, aspect ratio, etc. are listed. The little box at the right will show the numbers 99234.

I own every other season so I am able to compare this case to the others.  this one is not even close in quality as compared with the others.  Cant remember if the discs worked at the begining but soon after I purchased the discs did not play in their entirety.  too many scratches.

Bobby's father who is very ill whacks the troublesome Mustang Sally (some of the best television ever). Tracee's story, and Ralphie insures his own demise. Uncle Junior's cancer surgeon meets Furio! Tony meets Gloria. Gigi dies on beesha doo. The tell-tale moozadel episode, a parody of the original Dragnet show in dialogue. Matush gets a trip to the hospital compliments of Furio. Pine barrens episode; best of the Sopranos ever I think, (Chris and Paulie are lost on the woods). Amour fou episode; Jackie and pals pull a heist; Carmella meets Gloria; Gloria meets Patsie Parisi who passes her a message from T.  Jackie gets whacked.

I always thought the Russian would re-surface and create problems for Paulie & Christopher before the series ran its course but maybe that will happen with the full length movie version if, indeed, that project ever comes to fruition?

The series found its footing and hit its stride in season 3 making it the best of all.  Earlier seasons were a set up for '3' while the ones that followed were slowly descending down the other side of the mountain toward extinction.  Every episode in this season has linkage to the broader theme of the series and one anticipates the storyline far more clearly than in any other.  The characters are ALIVE, each knowing their role and comfortable with their character.  No stale acting or writing in '3'.

1723635,5,B000067S1H,"After finishing this Sopranos collection, I feel that the high quality acting and compelling plots that characterized the first two seasons carried through the third. The only weak link I see is the Dr. Melfi character, portrayed by Lorraine Bracco. I feel she is just too formal and stiff. She seems unnatural in a show that shines with entirely believable characters.

One highlight of this season is Tony's affair with Gloria (Annabella Sciorra). I feel Sciorra most convincingly depicts an attractive and emotionally unstable woman who is seduced by Tony's power and wealth. It seems she wants a lot of commitment from a man who has none to offer.

Episode Eleven, Pine Barrens, is an absolute classic. I roared with laughter as Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Christopher (Michael Imperioli) stumbled around in the snow and sought shelter from the bitter cold in an old abandoned truck. They had been trying to kill a man who was fleeing through the woods when they got lost. I found myself hoping that a scene would open showing Paulie and Christopher frozen solid in the truck.

The combination of the Mafia and family drama, along with the heavily symbolic writing, makes for my personal favorite show.  That being said, it is possible to understand why it is that many fans don't like the Third season as much as the previous two.  There is much more of a focus on the family edge of the show and there's less of a show of the Mafia side, at least for the first half of the season.  Don't get me wrong, it is still amazing; the cast is still stellar; the story lines are still engaging; and for those of you who love to see the usual crime sprees of the characters, that is still there, just not as much as in previous seasons.

In this season, the cast and writers alike, SHINE.  Here we really start getting to the meat of things.  And it's nothing if it's not like riding a fast-paced thrilling rollercoaster.  One you will not want to get off of.

I highly recommend the Sopranos series.  I am not a big action or mafia movie goer, nor am I big into the violence...but something within this show is bigger than all of that.  Something about family and a persons will to survive.  Much of what these characters go through, we all experience on some level or other.

1723661,5,B000067S1H,"Again, I struggled with penning these reviews because the series is really just too brilliant for words.  With each passing season `The Sopranos' perfected itself and left us with utter brilliance time and time again.  Each plot twist was so intricately woven into itself, so expertly crafted and engineered and most importantly delivered with such gusto and bravado that it feels so silky smooth against our eyes.  If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times, there is no television show before or after that has ever nor will ever amount to the effortless excellence that was `The Sopranos'.  Now, season three is lauded as one of if not the best season `The Sopranos' has ever experienced, and while I can't say that I wholeheartedly agree (I'm torn really since they were all so good) I can understand why there is so much love for this particular season.  Sadly we lost Nancy Marchand but we gained so much that her absence does not leave the void that could be expected.

With the passing of Livia Soprano some worries are set at ease but some serious inconveniences take their place.  Tony can rest easy that his mother won't flip on him to the feds but with her gone his sister soon moves into her home and starts demanding and expecting things that Tony is not ready to give her.  Janice moves herself into her mothers home all but manually removing Svetlana, the Russian nurse Tony hired to take care of his ailing mother, from the home.  Janice continues to make problems for Tony with her actions, but Tony also has issues a little more close to home to contend with.  His daughter Meadow has a new boyfriend, an African American boy named Noah whom Tony cannot accept.  He has no desire to see his daughter making a life with a non-Italian, especially not an African American (and part Jewish) boy.  Differences of opinion cause Tony and Meadow to clash on more than one occasion and threaten to destroy their relationship.  This also causes Tony to suffer more of his blackouts and a startling discovery is made as to the root cause of them.

There are changes that take place within the business as well.  Christopher finally gets his `made man' status but soon realizes it's not as glamorous as he expected.  He starts butting heads with Paulie and continues to do so throughout the season.  An episode in particular placing Christopher and Paulie lost in the wilderness in pursuit of a botched hit really fleshes out their tense relationship.  His promotion also affects Adriana, who at this point is working for Artie Bucco at his restaurant.  With Christopher prompting her to quit Artie is left to deal with his emotions and true feelings for Adriana.  With the end of his tense and unhealthy marriage he struggles with letting someone like Adriana out of his life.  There's also the issue of Ralph Cifaretto.  Ralph really becomes an essential character throughout this season, mostly because of his temper and his ability to illicit pure unadulterated loathing from the audience.  Ralph begins dating Rosalie Aprile, the late Jackie Aprile's widow.  Ralph's sporadic and uncontrolled actions though cause Tony to distance himself despite the families close relationship to Rosalie and to her son Jackie Jr.  An incident involving Ralph's stripper girlfriend alone nearly brings Tony to the point of murder.

This season also introduces us to Johnny Sack, a New York City mob boss who's moved into town.  As the seasons progress his relationship with Tony will grow, but at his arrival Tony is curious and maybe even skeptical of his presence.

The season brings a lot of turmoil and new revelations throughout the Soprano `family' in every meaning of the word.  Meadow grows as she leaves for collage and her relationships with both Noah and eventually Jackie Jr. are tested.  Jackie Jr. himself becomes the cause of most of Tony's grief as he struggles with a commitment he made to the boys late father and protecting his business and his family.  Jackie Jr. is insistent on being part of what his father helped helm but Tony refuses to allow him to ruin what he has going for him.  He wants him to finish school and get a respectable job and although Jackie Jr. agrees to try he fails to deliver.  Tony's relationships with women outside his marriage also take a turn for the more adventurous.  He finds himself a new girlfriend in Gloria Trillo, a fellow patient of Doctor Mefli's who also happens to be a Mercedes Benz saleswoman.  She's fun and exciting not to mention utterly gorgeous, but she is a little crazy and this puts a strain between her and Tony.  Tony's relationship with Doctor Melfi also takes a turn and this is apparent more in Melfi than it is in Tony.  When she is brutally attacked while leaving her office she becomes introverted and afraid and when given the opportunity to have someone like Tony take care of the problem her eyes say it all.  I won't go into much detail, but when you see it you'll know what I mean.  She is changing, especially in her feelings towards Tony and what he does, and this becomes very apparent.

The acting again this season is beyond brilliant.  James Gandolfini is again at the top of his game delivering Tony to us with such conviction and true vigor.  I swear with each passing year he got better and better.  Why he doesn't have seven Emmys to his name is beyond me.  Edie Falco, Larraine Bracco and Aida Turturro all shine this season, especially Turturro as Tony's meddlesome sister, but its Annabella Sciorra who really takes the cake for me here.  Her performance was just so memorable.  That, and she is unforgettably beautiful.  Jamie-Lynn Sigler ups her game here and only continues to shine as the seasons come and go, and towards the end of this season Robert Iler is also given a chance to grow.  Michael Imperioli is perfect here, as is Dominic Chianese and Tony Sirico, but those are give-ins.  Joe Pantoliano really delves in his character of Ralph, and does so brilliantly, and Sharon Angela is fantastic as Rosalie.  Vincent Curatola's Johnny Sack eventually becomes close to my favorite character on the show, and in this season he has his moments, but his true genius comes in seasons to follow.  John Ventimiglia does a great job as Artie, and I feel I must mention his as I have failed to do so in my previous reviews.  His character keeps growing with each passing season, but it's here that he really begins to flourish.

I could go on and on but who has the time to really read all I have to say.  Just know that season three is a definite high point in the evocative series known as `The Sopranos'.  The get everything right and deliver non-stop thought provoking entertainment that is sure to enjoy just about everyone.  There is really nothing negative to say about this show for from its conception till its death (is it really `dead'?) it has proved to be nothing short of spectacular.

Pine Barrens is of course a classic in the Christopher/Paulie relationship--I don't think is has ever again been presented better.

1723683,5,B000067S1H,"The first three seasons of HBO's ""The Sopranos"" just get better and better.  Too many series get lost after the original premise gets played out and the writers have nowhere for their characters to go after the first big climax.  ""The Sopranos"" is different - as each conflict gets resolved, two new crises emerge, each as dire and entertaining as the last.

But the series never spins out of control.  Tony, Carmela, Dr. Melfi, Meadow, Christopher . . . all of these characters remain true, even where they are over the top.  Season Three features some of the finest writing TV has to offer, and the cast led by James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, and Lorraine Bracco continues to offer stellar performances down the line.

Some of the plot lines that play major roles in Season Three include:

Tony finding peace in the arms of another woman (Annabella Sciorra), only to find that peace shattered;

Carmela struggling with the guilt that comes from living off blood money;

Janice takes on the Russians, finds God, and a narcoleptic boyfriend;

Tony struggles to handle a rebellious, murderous captain (Joe Pantoliano) while also trying to keep the son he wished he had, Jackie Aprile, Jr., in line;

Meadow's off at college and thinks she has found true love, twice;

Dr. Melfi struggles with vengeance and whether to use Tony to exorcise her demons;

The death of Livia (Nancy Marchand) affects everyone;

Uncle Junior struggles with cancer and house arrest;

and the FBI continues its unsuccessful war against the Soprano family, but starts to show some promise.

As you can see, Season Three offers plenty of meat on the bone for its audience - I didn't even mention the best episode of the season, which puts Christopher and Paulie in the New Jersey snowbound countryside chasing a dead Russian.

Fans of the first two seasons need no encouragement to check out Season Three.  If you haven't started this series yet, get to Season One and start watching!",1178841600,4,1955,4.837349397590361

1723685,5,B000067S1H,"The Sopranos, season 3, continues the story of Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mob boss who has to deal with all the hassels of organized crime as well as being the father of two kids and living in a tested marriage lifestyle. The thrid season does have its moments, and there are a lot of twists that made me want to continue on to season 4 and beyond...

Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood: An FBI agent named Agent Harris and his team construct a plan to bug the Soprano's household while everyone inside are away. This requires extensive planning from everyone, including tailing all the members of the Soprano household, even the maid, and planning when the right exact time is to set up a bug in the house. Meanwhile Tony is watching for any suspicious behavior from Patsy Parisi, a brother whose twin was killed and who was an ally of Uncle Junior.

Proshai Livushka: Tony is worried that his mom is going to rat on him to the Feds, but fortunately for him that never happens because Livia passes away. Despite her last wishes to not have a huge reception or funeral, Janice [Tony's sister] returns to throw a giant send-off. Meanwhile Meadow has a new boyfriend named Noah, who is both African American and Jewish, and Tony makes his own feelings for their relationship very clear, and it does not please Meadow one bit.

Fortunate Son: Christopher finally becomes a made man, but soon realizes its not all glamour and glory. Janice moves into her mother's house, but realizes that the Russian nurse, Svetlana, has been given a valuable record collection. Tensions mount after Svetlana refuses to give the collection to Janice. Meanwhile Tony and Dr. Melfi finally began to make headway in figuring out just what is causing Tony's panic attacks.

Employee of the Month: A man named Ralph, who took over the late mob boss Jackie Aprile's garbage business, is dating Jackie's widow and has endeared himself to Jackie's son, Jackie Jr. However he and Tony do not get along very much. However the real story is with Dr. Melfi, who becomes the victim of a very serious crime. Janice and Svetlana's feud comes to head with the introduction of the Russian mafia, and Tony can't help but wonder why a New York City mob boss, Johnny Sack, has come to town.

Another Toothpick: A retired hit man named Bobby ""Bacala"" Baccilieri comes out for one last hit against the wishes of his son and Uncle Junior and ends up in a bloody and violent gunfight. Christopher convinces his girlfriend, Adriana, to quit her job at Artie's restaurant, which leads to some questionable antics by Artie. Carmela is now actually taking Tony's therapy sessions with him, which leads to some awkward moments in Dr. Melfi's office. Also Tony fixes a speeding ticket, but soon regrets his decision.

University: Ralph is having a seriously violent relationship with a stripper that leads to a moment of violence between him and Tony in a parking lot. Meadow's relationship with Noah is put to the test when her needy roommate starts hanging around them all the time as they try to cheer her up.

Second Opinion: Tony wants Uncle Jr. to get a second opinion about him possibly having cancer. Carmela takes Dr. Melfi's advice and starts seeing a shrink. Meanwhile Christopher has to continue to deal with embarrassing situations with Paulie regarding with him being a made man now, and finally Tony has a ""chat' with the wife of the late former friend of the family.

He Is Risen: Tony's feud with Ralph soon starts to escalate after taking Ralph's invitation to come to Thanksgiving away. Ralph, upset at how he is being treated, goes to New York crime boss Johnny Sack for help. Meanwhile Meadow and Jackie Aprile Jr. soon realize they have a lot more in common than they thought and start dating. Also Tony sees a beautiful patient of Dr. Melfi's and generously gives up his appointment so the other patient can see Dr. Melfi instead.

The Telltale Moozadell: Tony has a  new woman, a Mercedes saleswoman, and takes her all over the place in style. Christopher gives Adrianna her own club, while he and Furio are the two partners behind the scenes, but there are problems with drug dealing in the club which Furio takes care of. Also Anthony Jr. is caught vandalizing his school, but the punishment given to him from the school leaves Carmela a little puzzled. And finally Tony gives Jackie Jr. a serious talk about treating Meadow with respect.

To Save Us All from Satan's Power...: Tony catches Jackie Jr. at a club with a woman who is not Meadow, and wants to ""talk"" to Jackie Jr. about it. Its Christmas time and for the first time in a long time there is no Santa to play for the kids coming to visit to get presents, so everyone points the finger at someone else to play Santa. Tony is also haunted by the memory of one of his former best friends, who he took out at the end of season two, and his memories only double after a Christmas present from Meadow.

Pine Barrens: After losing a victim in the South Jersey wilderness, Paulie and Christopher struggle with injuries, hunger, extreme cold, and no idea if they will survive the night. Meadow starts to get a suspicion that Jackie Jr. is cheating on her, which leads to a surprising ending. Also, Tony's new mistress Gloria may have some hidden problems, problems that are surprisingly similar to another woman of Tony's past...

Amour Fou: Jackie Jr. hears a tale from Ralph about how his own father became a made man and decides to rob a local card game. This decision may turn out to be his very last...Meanwhile Tony finds it harder and harder to spend time with Gloria, but after she threatens to tell Carmela all about their secret relationship, Tony has to figure out what to do with her. Meanwhile Carmela has had a huge guilt trip because of how she lives and where the money comes to pay for all her gifts from Tony and decides to confess to a priest.

The Army of One: Anthony Jr. gets in trouble yet again at his school, so the decision is made to send him to military school to put some discipline into him. Also there is another death in the family that results in everything falling apart. Paulie is upset because Ralph owes him money, so they have a sit down to discuss things, and finally the entire family gathers in Artie's restaurant where Uncle Jr. makes his return to the family in full swing...

This is still one of the greatest shows ever made. Each season is worth watching again and again. I will continue to review each season until I have finished the whole series. Season3, much like 1 and 2 that I have already reviewed, is highly recommended...",1171238400,12,6599,4.628205128205129
1723686,5,B000067S1H,"The storylines and acting performances are tremendous.  There were many a night where you want to watch only one episode, and get sucked into watching five.  You will not be disappointed.",1169510400,,187,5.0
1723687,5,B000067S1H,"I have watched through to the sixth season, but I have still not shaken episodes from the third season... ESPECIALLY the one called ""University"" (spoilers ahead)

The episode ""University"" to me, completely pushed home the concept that this was a show more about how some people are underprivileged and others are so well off. But also the concept of ""hawks and sparrows"".  The idea of a mafia ""family"" comes not from opulence, but desperation.  In this particular episode, the daughter of mob boss Tony Soprano begins to date a Columbia University student who happens to be Jewish/African American to which Tony is completely overwrought with anger.  At the same time, a desperate stripper tries to gain Tony's trust in his mafia world, but only finds horror, humiliation,  and eventually death at the hands of one of the ""made guys"".  It is not an accident that she is just around the same age as Tony Soprano's own daughter...

The writers of the show are completely aware of what they are doing, and what it is, is nothing short of trying to reintegrate compassion into our collective psyche.. A noble gesture, I would say..  and using the Kinks ""Living on a Thin Line"" to open and close the episode is just pure genius.",1167350400,5,1223,4.76303317535545
1723688,4,B000067S1H,"By the time ""The Sopranos"" entered its third season, it had solidified its standing as a ""weekly event"".  There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be put into this category.  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  The first two seasons of the show not only established a show of high entertainment value, but a show that also was of high quality.  Season 3,  ""The Sopranos - The Complete Third Season"" does have some very good episodes, it does take a slight notch down from the first two years.

The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony also suffers from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).

The problem I see with Season 3 is that it starts out slow.  While Season 2 started out a bit slow, Season 3 even has a slower start that lasts longer.  The opening episode involving the FBI wiretapping Tony Soprano's house is probably the weakest episode that aired throughout the 2+ seasons the show has been on.  At the same time, three of the strongest episodes to date are also included in this season:  ""...To Save Us All From Satan's Power..."" (The Christmas Episode); ""Pine Barrens"" (a Classic in which Christopher Moltisanti and Paulie Walnuts get lost in the Pine Barrens of South Jersey); and ""Amour Fou"" (the penultimate episode of the season).  The other point is that the Season's final episode is very weak.

Here are some of the key storylines from Season 3:
1-Tony and Carmela's marriage continues to endure great strain.  Things get more complicated during this season when Tony begins a torrid affair with a Mercedes Saleswoman Gloria Trillo (played by Annabella Sciorra).

2- Christopher Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli) becomes a ""Made Man"".  Upon his entrance into the ""inner circle"", he begins to butt heads to the ""Captain"" he reports into - that being Paulie Walnuts (played by Tony Sirico).

3- Joe Pantoliano joins the case as Ralph (Ralphie) Cifaretto.  Ralphie is a sarcastic character who is dating the widow of former DiMeo Crime Boss Jackie Aprile.  Ralphie plays a ""Made Man"" in the family and seeks a promotion to ""Captain"".  At the same time he is causing ""fits"" for Tony Soprano.  At times I found Pantoliano's character irritating.

4-Dr. Jennifer Melfi is raped in Episode 4.  For the first two years, I feel this has been the most misused character on the show.  Although this crime provides an opportunity to expand Melfi's character, the producers once again do not take advantage of this.

5-Tony and Carmela's daughter, Meadow Soprano (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler) goes off to Columbia University.  She begins dating an African American Jewish Student (Noah Tannenbaum) and then the son of the late Jackie Aprile (Jackie Aprile, Jr.).  Both of these situations are going to also cause ""fits"" for Tony Soprano.

6-Jackie Aprile Jr.(played by Jason Cerbone) begins to play a more prominent role on the show.  In addition to dating Meadow, he is also going to be involved with drugs while being influenced by his mother's boyfriend, Ralphie Cifaretto.  Despite causing ""fits"" for Tony, Tony will feel loyal to Jackie Jr. because of the relationship he had with Jackie Sr.

7-As mentioned above, the FBI will start a wiretapping effort on Tony.  While this is the focus of the weak season opener to Season 3, this plot just seems to hit a dead-end as the season goes on. At the end of Season 2, Tony was arrested for counterfeit airline tickets - but this too goes nowhere during this season.

8-Uncle Junior (played by Dominic Chianese) remains under house arrest as he awaits his day in court to battle the Federal Charges he is facing.  His health problems continue as he begins a battle with Stomach Cancer.

9-Actress Nancy Marchand who played Tony's mother Livia passed away before Season 3.  As a result the character of Livia also dies, but not before some creative use of technology to have one more episode with Livia (even after Marchand's death).

10-Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iler) finds success on the Football field, but continues to get himself into trouble.

Here are some other points to consider from Season 3:
- Despite some weaker storylines, James Gandolfini really emerges during this season.  He provides some of his best acting during the season.
- Paulie Walnuts has always been one of the better characters.  Next to Gandolfini's performances, it is Sirico's performance of Paulie that is second best..
- Bobby ""Bacala""'s role expands during this year.  Bacala's portrayal of ""Santa Claus"" is hysterical.  This season also features a guest appearance from Burt Young as Bobby's father.
- Vito Spatafore (played by Joseph R. Gannascoli) also begins to see an expanded role.

As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, I do think ""The Sopranos"" took a step down when comparing it to the previous two years.  However, watching Season 3 is still good enough to be categorized as a ""television event"".  Plus the three episodes mentioned above stack up among the show's best overall.  Overall, this is a very good and entertaining set - highly recommended.",1149897600,3,5925,4.877877877877878
1723689,5,B000067S1H,"The third season of ""The Sopranos"" continued on with its splendid storytelling, brilliant acting, and top-notch directing. Season three had at least one new challenge for writer/creator David Chase: dealing with the character of Tony's evil mother Livia. Chase originally had Livia written into the first several episodes of season three. Then Nancy Marchand, the actress who played Livia, died of lung cancer in June 2000. ""The Sopranos"" lost a dear member of the family, and Chase had to go back and re-write those episodes. In the second episode of season three (titled ""Proshai, Livushka""), Marchand made a cameo appearence as Livia with the help of previous existing footage and special effects. Then she dies, and the entire Soprano clan come together for her funeral. This is a good episode, even though the scene where Livia comes in for one last moment looks awkward. But Chase wanted to give Marchand and her character a fitting tribute to one of their own. ""The Sopranos"" also lost another regular cast member: Vincent Pastore, who played Tony's dear friend Pussy (and got whacked at the end of season two). Season three introduced a couple of new characters. Joe Pantoliano came on to portray unstable mobster Ralph Cifaretto; Annabella Sciorra guest starred in the latter episodes of season three as Gloria Trillo, a car saleswoman who Tony starts having an affair with; and Jason Carbone as Jackie Aprile Jr., son of the late mob boss Jackie Aprile Sr., who was always getting in trouble, which constantly aggravated Tony. Season three of ""The Sopranos"" featured some very strong episodes, including the fourth episode (""Employee of the Month""). This is the episode in which Tony's shrink Dr. Melfi gets raped, and features the best acting that Lorraine Bracco has done on the show. But probably the most talked about episode from season three without a doubt has got to be the eleventh, ""Pine Barrens"". To this day I still keep hearing people talk about this episode, in which two of Tony's wiseguys (Christopher and Paulie) get lost in the woods after unsuccessfully trying to whack a Russian mobster. This is a great episode, and is worth seeing just to watch the great acting by Michael Imperioli (Christopher) and Tony Sirico (Paulie). The third season of ""The Sopranos"" received 22 Emmy nominations, and won James Gandolfini and Edie Falco their second Emmys for Best Actor and Actress in a Drama Series. It also won an Emmy for the second time in the writing category for the episode ""Employee of the Month"".

""The Sopranos"" season three is an absolute winner. Though not up to season one, it's better than season two!",1142294400,,2639,4.957110609480813

So it went until I'd watched the entire season.  I was that ""into it.""  I was on the edge of my seat as I yelled at the TV when Dr. Melfi came close to telling Tony about her rape (""Tell him!  Tell him!"").  I laughed at the hilarious ""Pine Barrens"" entry and watched it again.

I signed up for HBO after watching this season because there was no way I could wait for years to find out what would happen next.  And I bought the first three seasons for my library.

1723703,5,B000067S1H,"Along with Sex And The City, the HBO original series The Sopranos took the world by storm in the late-1990s with its cutting edge drama and acerbic wit. A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...

Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...

The Sopranos (Season 3) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood"" in which the Soprano family continues their daily routine, completely unaware that the FBI is plotting an intricate scheme to bug their house. Meanwhile, Tony begins some plotting of his own when Patsy begins asking too many questions about his brother's death... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Fortunate Son"" in which Tony learns that his panic attacks are partly due to genetics and past events from his childhood, and ""He is Risen"" in which Tony's problems with Ralphie bubble to surface when Ralphie doesn't get the promotion he hoped for...

1723704,5,B000067S1H,"I thought it would be hard to match the absolute brilliance of Season 2, but David Chase has done it again.  Season 3 shows a more personal, darker side of the Sopranos and it works beautifully.  The first two episodes are classic Sopranos, with the ever-pesky FBI trying to bug Tony's house and a hilariously disfunctional wake being held for Livia.  From there, things get much darker with ""Employee Of The Month"" and ""University.""  ""University"" in particular does an amazing job of showcasing the cruel, depressing side of the high life at The Bing.  It's the first Sopranos episode that I can say honestly broke my heart.  Heavy stuff for a show that was originally seen as a jokey, witty continuation of Goodfellas.  That's not to say there isn't a lot of the trademark Sopranos humor here.  In addition to the aforementioned wake-gone-wrong, there's the now-famous ""Pine Barrens"" episode, and Carmella manifests her growing discontent with Tony and her trouble keeping Meadow happy in several classic moments.  Her reaction when Tony complains about the pulp in his orange juice is particularly great.  Edie Falco really proves herself to be an amazingly versatile, amazingly sympathetic, downright AMAZING actress here and she is matched by almost all of the cast, notably the always-impressive Micheal Imperioli and Lorainne Braco, flashy newcomer Joe Pantoliano (of ""Memento"" fame), and of course James Gandolfini.  The writing is just as sharp.  In some ways, Season 3 is a reaction to season 2, as it revists familiar storylines but subverts them in interesting ways.  Ralphie at first seems like Ritchie part II, but things turn out much differently, and Jackie Jr.'s pathetic wannabe aspirations echo those of the two guys responsible for sending Christopher to the hospital, but are complicated by his relationship with Meadow and his position as Jackie Aprile's son.  All this makes for an incredible viewing experience that never fails to be thought-provoking and emotionally engaging.",1111190400,,2001,5.193146417445483
1723705,5,B000067S1H,"I'm a great fan of the series and have all four seasons on DVD and just finishing watching 5 on HBO.  The third season is my favorite by far.  Some reasons why:
The introduction of Ralphie Cifaretto to the show (played outstandingly by Joe Pantoliano), the hilarious and well acted Pine Barrens episode, the great chemistry and high drama between Tony Soprano & Gloria Trullo (Anabella Sciorra), and Jason Cerbone as Jackie Aprile (nice plot line involving him and besides he's great eye candy), the return of Janice, Carmella's scene in the male psychiatrist's office when she briefly confronts the reality of her life.
It's just fantastic and like the entire show so far, it's a must see.  Although some were disappointed with Season 5 and truthfully it could have been better, the Sopranos continues to be complex and quality TV.  It's more than just a mob show, for sure.",1090195200,4,875,4.8133333333333335
1723706,5,B000067S1H,"If you are looking at this review, you probably already have the first and second season. All I can tell you is that the third season is as good, if not better, than the first and second. This is truly one of the best series ever to have graced the television screen. Leave it to HBO to have come up with such an engaging, well-written, well-acted, and totally addictive series.
There are some major plot developments this season. Starting off slowly, the first episode chronicles the synchronized, often comical efforts of the FBI, which is trying to get an electronic surveillance bug in place in the Soprano's household. The season then heats up considerably from thereon.
Livia Soprano, Tony's wicked mother and a canker in her children's lives, dies, bringing daughter Janice back from where she had fled, after she had bumped off her manic boyfriend, Richie Aprile, last season. Janice returns with a narcoleptic, musician boyfriend who is the antithesis of Richie. As always, Janice likes to stir up trouble, and her mother Livia's wake and funeral services are fertile country for her new machinations and self-importance. When she tries to stir up trouble with Livia's one legged, Russian caregiver, which leaves the caregiver searching for her missing prosthetic leg, however, Janice soon discovers that she has gone too far, and her chickens come home to roost with a vengeance.
Meadow, the Soprano's daughter and eldest child, a college student at Ivy League Columbia University, gets a new boyfriend, Noah Tannenbaum. He is handsome, intelligent, and articulate, and Tony hates him on the spot for reasons the viewer will quickly discern, as Tony pulls no punches with Noah. This will create a certain amount of tension between father and daughter, and an estrangement ensues. When Noah breaks her heart, Jackie Aprile, Jr. is waiting in the wings with her parent's blessing, and Meadow goes from the frying pan into the fire.
Anthony Soprano, Jr., the Sopranos' other angst ridden teenager and youngest child, who has turned out to be an unexpected gridiron wonder, is also sowing his wild oats, getting himself in deep trouble at school, much to his parents' anger and dismay. When Anthony, Jr. continues in this vein, there is a big surprise in store for him, causing him to undergo a major life change. He is not, however, the only Soprano family member to do so.
Tony finds himself head over heels with Gloria, another of Dr. Melfi's patients. A Mercedes car salesperson, Gloria, the new light of Tony's life, is gorgeous, passionate, and a totally loose cannon. She will cause quite a bit of conflict for Tony as their affair heats up, as Gloria likes to fight fire with fire. Gloria has to watch out that she, herself, does not get burned.
Carmela, Tony's long suffering and patient wife, being only human, finds her thoughts increasingly absorbed by Tony's henchman, Furio, the sexy, pony tailed Italian. The problem is that Furio, too, is experiencing deep feelings for Tony's wife, a situation that can only become increasingly dangerous for all concerned. How Furio and Carmela handle their feelings and resolve this potentially dangerous development is of great interest.
Dr. Melfi herself undergoes great personal angst this season, following her violent rape at the hands of a stranger. A very conflicted Dr. Melfi finds herself on the edge of taking a path from which there can be no return. This season also finds Dr. Melfi doing husband/wife tag team counseling with both Tony and Carmela, a venture that provides some comic relief and gives rise to potential conflict of interest.
Meanwhile, Jackie Aprile, Jr., Tony's godson and Meadow's new main squeeze, the deceptively soft spoken and good looking son of the late mob boss, Jackie Aprile, Tony's best friend, is up to no good. Lying through his teeth about everything to everyone, he is misguided by his seriously unstable step-father, mob made man Ralph Cifaretto, who is busy plying both sides of the coin. It seems that Ralph, dissatisfied with the role to which he has been relegated within the family, is doing Tony dirty, going against his wishes at every turn, and the situation with Jackie, Jr. is no exception, a situation that will culminate in heartbreak for all concerned.
Back at the ranch, Tony's other henchmen seem to have their own troubles. Corrado ""Uncle Junior"" Soprano, the nominal boss of the family, who is kept in check by his nephew Tony, is busy battling cancer and a federal prosecution. Young Christopher Moltisanti, Tony's nephew, gets his long desired promotion, and is told to report to Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gaultieri. Christopher soon finds out that with Paulie ""Walnuts"" business is business. Meanwhile, Christopher gets involved in a sideline that bodes ill for him and his fiancee.
When Tony sends a resentful Paulie ""Walnuts"", accompanied by Christopher, on a mission that should have been that of another, Christopher sees an unexpected side of Paulie. When the mission, involving a member of the Russian mob, goes bad at the hands of an angry Paulie, Christopher discovers that Paulie may not be as stand up a guy as Christopher thought. While this is a terrific episode, very funny in a macabre sort of way, it also cleverly sets up Paulie in a new light for future developments. This particular episode, one of my favorites, is a feather in the cap of actor Stephen Buscemi, who directed it.
These are just some of the highlights of the third season. There is so much more! The writing continues to be intelligent, and the story lines are as well thought out and engrossing as ever. The performances are uniformly stellar. The late, great actress, Nancy Marchand, whose portrayal of the venomous Livia Soprano was a feather in her cap, left a legacy of memories, having died after creating such a memorable character. She will sorely be missed. This third season's attempt to bridge her death and use existing footage and computer effects to create a dialogue between Livia and Tony, however, was misguided, as its effect is a tad ghoulish, as well as disturbing.  Nonetheless,  I absolutely love this series!",1072915200,41,6130,4.967867575462512
1723707,3,B000067S1H,"If the last episode of Season Two got you hooked, you're going to be on the edge of your seat for Season Three.  The DVD screensaver intro is different than past collections.  Special features are also on Disc 1 which leads to cast and filmmakers,series index and DVD-ROM/Weblink.  If it has been awile since you've seen Sopranos, it also offers you a Season One and Season Two recap.

Tony's mother has passed on--as has the fine actress who played her, sadly--and he's thinking.. O.k. my biggest irritant is gone, right?  I'm done with therapy.  Wrong!
Carmella begins to really come into her own in this season and we see more of Melfi.  The rape of Dr. Melfi and her susbsequent moral battle--whether to utilize the services of Tony Soprano in righting her personal wrong--was just brilliant.  {And, I for one, really wanted her to tell Tony what was going on.. to get that rapist the Adios he deserved.  She is a bigger woman than me!}
Paulie and Christopher out in the snow is one of the funniest episodes I've seen.  They say the actor who plays Paulie is really fussy about his hair and so for him to walk around for most of an episode with his hair mussed was torturous for him!
Annabella Sciorra makes a nice turn here as Gloria, Tony's mistress de jour.  Nice.  She and Tony have some heat and she plays her role very well.
Add to that, the misbehavior of Jackie Jr. and the FBI's attempts to wire the home and you have a great season!",1069113600,10,1276,4.476190476190476
1723709,5,B000067S1H,"As compelling as the first two seasons were, season three is even more compelling, which is at odds with what I'd heard from several different people.  Series creator David Chase obviously had to continue and even further improve on the intriguing and suspenseful saga that is the ""family"" life of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano and he and the rest of the cast and crew did that quite successfully with this particular season.
The entire season is set up quite beautifully with them giving a larger role to the Jackie Aprile Jr. character and them showing what Tony tried to do to keep the kid out of the business and harms way and of course, Joe Pantoliano's role as Ralph is brilliant in the conflict it creates between him and Tony.
Every one of the actors and actresses deserve every award and accolade they've received for their performances in this brilliant season.  The ever beautiful Annabella Sciorra makes a very poignant and compelling guest appearance and her acting skills shine through in this role.
I highly recommend not only this third season DVD set but every one that is available; you will be hard pressed to find a more compelling and intriguing series on television today that covers the material that the Sopranos does with such ease.

1723724,4,B000067S1H,"The third season of HBO's acclaimed Sopranos continues the established tradition of this film-quality television series.  The Sopranos are a fairly normal suburban New Jersey family except that the father, Tony, is the head of an organized crime organization.  In the third season, Tony's mother Livia dies (as did the actress that portrayed her, Nancy Marchand), daughter Meadow goes off to Columbia University, son Anthony, Jr. struggles to stay in high school, and Tony's mobster friends continue with their regular business ventures.  James Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony is always at the heart of the series' success.  He is able to pull off the difficult task of being likeable as a suburban father while simultaneously cheating on his wife and killing people.  People I know who don't usually care for onscreen sex, violence, and foul language are irrestibly drawn to this series because of its compelling performances, professional direction and screenwriting, and long-spanning story arcs.  There is a large cast of supporting characters whose stories progress as the audience becomes more familiar with them, as in a daytime soap opera.  Of course, some of them get whacked.  Actually, the third season has considerably less killing and nudity than the first two.  But the profanity continues in full force.  This is not material suitable for the kiddies.  To me the best aspect of the content of this series is the way it examines the themes of integrity, responsibility, and especially loyalty.  There is a perverse sense of justice when a disloyal mobster is ""disappeared"" by the collective efforts of his mob family.  The DVD extras are very slight.  The featurette is very short but does offer a chance to hear the actor who portrays Furio speak without his Italian accent.  The audio commentaries by actor/screenwriter Michael Imperioli, director (better known as an actor, though not of Sopranos) Steve Buscemi, and creator David Chase are among the least informative I have ever heard.  Buscemi, one of my favorite actors, is entirely too humble and deferential to the set-in-place Sopranos powers-that-be to deliver any sort of authority on his commentary.  But despite the lack of substantive DVD extras, this package is well worth watching to those who like competently delivered episodic television.

1723726,5,B000067S1H,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the third season of THE SOPRANOS.  The first season was brilliant, but the second seemed transitional, at best.  The talking fish, the side trip to Italy, the mini-rise and major fall of Richie Aprile--season II didn't seem to add up to all that much.  It was still better than 90% of whatever else is on television, but the question remained, was the bloom of the rose, had the Sopranos gone flat?
The third season laid all doubts to rest.  In short, it was the best season yet.  Emmy winner Edie Falco got the screen time she unaccountably failed to get in the second season.  The sub-plot involving Melfi's rape and subsequent inner turmoil was much more solid dramatically than anything the writers came up with for Lorraine Bracco in the series' sophomore year.  And while some have complained that the loose cannon storyline involving Ralphie Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano) was a replay of the Richie Aprile storyline, it was actually a much more satisfying plotline (better developed with more twists--didn't Ralphie's doom seem inevitable after he ""disrespected the Bing""? Well, surprise!).  Aida Turturro's Janice is used to better effect this season.  And the storyline involving Meadow and her two profoundly different romances was just about perfect.  And how about Christopher and Paulie lost in the Pine Barrens?  A classic episode.
And of course, James Gandolfini was just great.  Never a false note.  When you consider all the two-bit thug roles Gandolfini was consigned to prior to taking on this master thug role (and role of a lifetime) as Tony Soprano,  well, you're just grateful that this remarkable actor finally found a project that allowed him to demonstrate his full range.
About the only thing Sopranos 3 lacked was Nancy Marchand (except in that awkward digitally generated scene in episode 2).  That couldn't be helped, of course, but her absence was at least somewhat compensated by marvelous turns by all the other female leads (and I would include new comer/special guest star Annabella Sciorra among them).
I stopped getting cable two years ago, so I had to wait until the third season became commercially available to see it.  I had read plenty of good things about year 3 and was looking forward it.  Turns out it was well worth the wait.  Word on the fourth season is that it's a lot weaker.  I've learned to reserve judgment myself, but it does seem possible that the even numbered  years may prove to be, as noted above, ""transitional"" and less powerful dramatically.  If so, the planned fifth and final season, scheduled for 2003 or 2004 may still take the series out with a bang... Or several.",1036713600,4,2669,4.886666666666667

I loved all three seasons, what can I say?
I come from that part of the country and they DO talk like that, they DO look like that, and they DO dress like that. I used to work in a shady office in construction where things did, indeed fall off the back of the truck. All the little verbal tics and slang expressions are geniune.
For Season Three:
The characters grow more complex. In this season, I found Dr. Melfi to be exceptionally compelling as she grew to understand her relationship to her patient and how his role in her life changed.  Tony Soprano is a complicated man - repulsive and cute, amoral and loyal, seemingly unintelligent, yet an avid reader of ""The Art of War"". That's just the tip of the iceberg. All of the characters, even the poor dopey strippers, have complex inner lives, desires and motivations.
A truly gripping series, best watched in huge marathon chunks.

position of the psychiatrist is one of an observer who knows more than the individual characters. In one example, an elderly
psychotherapist refuses to take ""blood money"" from Carmela, who continues on with her life unaffected by his admonition. Tony refuses to listen when his therapist wants to explain the real reasons for his actions.  Much like Oedipus, Tony is doomed to compulsively act out his unconscious destiny.

1723748,5,B000067S1H,"I waited a few months before I finally received my order, and it was well worth it.  The first two seasons had made The Sopranos my favourite television programme ever.  The third installment could have been a let down, it could have just carried on in the same vein or it could have blossomed in all the right areas into almost perfection.  There is less violence, less comedy but the overall package even tops the first two seasons.  The characters are looked at more carefully.  Tony shows his love for Carmella even if it means having an affair to keep them from arguing!  Meadow has grown into a woman and AJ has even more traits of his father.  Is Paulie on the verge of moving away from the family?  Will Ralphie get his comeupance?  These questions and more are thrown into the equation and we will all wait on tenterhooks for Season Four to deliver the answers.  Season Three also gives us the greatest episode ever (Pine Barrens).  Directed by Steve Buscemi, it is hilarious.  Paulie's, ""stop getting ... with me"" and ""mix the relish with the ketchup"" had me in stitches.",1033948800,,1081,4.572916666666667
1723749,5,B000067S1H,"If you want a summary of the plot, read the other reviews, this is a little thought peice on the reasons why viewers have such a ""mo fo"" (Tonese for ""amour fou"") relationship with this series.
First of all, I agree that this season carried on with the best parts of the first two seasons, but its darker and maybe even wearier in tone than the last two. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the great things about this series as TV drama: the characters are on long enough temporal arcs that they can undergo serious changes in character and temprament in a thoroughly convincingly human way. And it is to the writers' directors' and actors lasting credit that they make it convincing, engaging and utterly compelling.  This is ensemble dramatic work at its absolute best.
One example is Tony himself.  In the first two seasons you see his charismatic side at work brilliantly.  He's on his way up and his brutality and ambition are juxtaposed against his native intelligence and charm in a thoroughly captivating manner.
By the third season, the viewer can sense Tone's increasing sense of being burdened by his past actions.  He has gained weight, and is becoming more and more irascible, even as the immediate problems in his life (his mother and the loose cannon Richie Aprile) meet their appropriate fates.
Rather than conflicts between characters (though there is plenty of that, with the grating Ralfie and the N-Syncly boorish Jackie Jr. as major examples), it is really Big Pussy's betrayal and the Family's response to it that stands like a looming ghost over Tony, Paulie and Silvio.  Try as they might in their various ways to bluff and bluster their way past what has happened, its clear that that whole incident has pulled each of these men closer to a psychological abyss.
Silvio is no longer the ever affable ""man about town"". The episode set in the strip club was chilling in its intensity and in its casual revelation of Silvio's ruthless side. Even more disturbing, the formerly poised and level-headed Paulie has become territorial, mean-spirited and querelous perhaps even to the point of defection.  Treachery and despair lurk in the corners of this season of the Sopranos like drunken bigoted relatives at a wedding. Even Christopher (rapidly evolving from youthful idiot to a more stable and likeable character) feels the ripples of this new turn in the series' arc.
On a more human level, Carmela, Meadow and Anthony Jr. also struggle with their own disaffections and problems with their involvement in ""the thing"" leading to confrontations by turns, comic, disturbing and wrenching with Tony's dark side.  Perhaps most pitiable is poor old Artie whose personal life just seems to hit rock after rock with no end in sight. He seems utterly bereft of any of the support the others gain from each other, and thus apparently at least, doomed.
Tony himself is deep in the woods of his own psyche. For my money, one of the most disturbing scenes comes in the Christmas episode where he struggles to show his appreciation for the stolen ""Billy Bass"" innocently given to him by an Meadow while at the same time being overwhelmed by the toy's resemblance to his imagined reincarnation of Big Pussy as a dead fish on a fishmonger's display.  Rage and terror play across his face and writhe into nervous good humor and ""seasonal gratitude"". James Gandolfini deserves every cent he earns as an actor for that one scene alone.
This season has turned the violence of the show inward on its protagonists. By sprinkling levity (as others have noted most obviously during the episode directed by Steve Buscemi - with shades of ""Fargo"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""A Simple Plan""- , but also in slyer moments such as Furio's intimidation of an arrogant doctor -""You gotta bee onna your hat"" is now one of my favorite lines-, the archival footage of the OJ trials, and the appearance of a bland and annoying rock band called ""The Miami Relatives"") through this dark vision, the series maintains its dramatic integrity and its hold on the audience.
I have not experienced any series that has been able to hold my attention and satisfy my taste for intelligent human drama like ""the Sopranos"" and that is why this DVD series gets 5 stars.  Hey I'd give it fifty if I could, but I have to send some of them up the food chain.",1033689600,15,4320,4.764705882352941
1723750,5,B000067S1H,"The third season of The Sopranos is marked by a violent streak throughout the season.  The year starts off slowly with the first episode revolving around the Feds trying to place a bug in the Soprano household.  It really is a wasted hour.  The second episode is also slow, revolving around the death of the family matriarch, Livia (due to the passing of the great Nancy Marchand).  Being that the first season of the show and really the basis of the show are Tony's struggles with the psychological abuse his mother placed on him, the show doesn't really spend much time with the incident.  But after the first two episodes, the season gets on role.  The new year introduces Joe Pantiliano as Ralphie Cifaretto, who has a nasty mean streak, a perverse obsession with the film Gladiator and a big problem with Tony.  The season's violent streak involves powerful episodes revolving around the rape of Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco has never been better in her portrayal of how a rape can scar one both physically and emotionally), Ralphie viscously beating and killing his stripper girlfriend (in the same episode Silvio smacks the girl around for skipping out on work), a man get savagely beat with a golf club, we learn that Tony had his first panic attack after witnessing his father chop off the finger of the butcher, Mr. Satriale and Tony comes to blows with his new girlfriend Gloria (played by Annibella Sciorra) that is one of the most intense and gripping scenes in the show's history.  As usual, James Gandolfini shows why he is the best actor on television right now, with another brilliant season of acting.  The Sopranos is one of the best television programs of all time and the third season adds to its legacy.",1033689600,2,1723,4.735785953177258
1723751,5,B000067S1H,"Yes, when I buy each set of the Sopranos, in the viewing nights ahead it becomes my reason for being. Nothing interferes with my seeing my newly purchased set.  It was true for sets one and two and now three. The first episode is a bit weak as it involves federal agents wiring Tony's house but after that the series takes off with a roar. There is so much good stuff going on that is would take a journal to catalogue them all.  However, here are some of the highlights. Tony's mother's funeral is an incredible study of how death can sanctify even the most vile of people.  However, the wake becomes a festering point where only so much hypocrisy can survive before exploding.

Carmella seeks separate psychiatric help and that is my favorite scene in the whole series.  Her psychiatrist is the one and only person to turn down Soprano money in the series, saying that the reason he won't accept payment is that it is blood money. He says that she has to hear and understand that she is living on blood money and that is the root of her problems. Now she will not be able to say she never heard that truth.  The daughter Meadow becomes involved with a young man also connected to the Soprano crime family but only on the farthest reaches of it.  His stepfather, however, is key to Tony's entire organization.

Tony's sister Janet steals her late mother's caregiver's artificial leg to get some LP records back from her. Janet essentially is coming to replace the mother in the series but she engrafts a West Coast flakiness onto the inner rotten core, a very unusual combination of character traits but it works.  Once again, the Sopranos manages to capture the women in this setting better than any previous crime family saga. These women are not doormats.  There is a lot going on in each and every one of them and I find them even more fascinating than the men in the series.  Tony's psychiatrist is back too with trauma of her own to handle and she is tempted to let Tony handle her problem for her in his usual violent manner.  If you can resist this series, you are a stronger person than I.  I positively wallow in it.

1723763,5,B000067S1H,"Okay, there's a bit of a darker tone in the way Tony's analyst Dr. Melfi is starting to unravel. Her fellow-shrink husband is on her case about treating a gangster. And to top it off, she's attacked in her office building parking garage. Then the scumbag gets busted but walks on an evidence blunder. Although no one ever comes out and says it, she gives off unmistakeable vibes that she'd love to ask Tony to have the slimeball whacked! Which we know he'd do in a New Jersey minute--he idolizes the lady. But there are a lot of good gags in this one, starting with the ongoing Keystone Kops flavor of FBI bugging on the Soprano home. At the risk of sounding like one of those overage petulant adolescents among the anti-government weenie set, I love the way The Bureau plants devices in the basement, then one of the agents in the surveillance van spots the fact that the home's water heater is about to blow (do they teach plumbing at Quantico?) then WHOOOOSSHHH--next scene shows Tony and Carmela wading around in knee deep water trying to save threatened belongings. To add insult to injury, the mike had been stashed in a gooseneck lamp, which daughter Meadow approprates to take back to the dorm. Then there's Richie Aprile Jr., whose papa wanted to do a Michael Corleone on him and keep him out of the Family business. So, despite Tony's best efforts to honor his dead friend's wishes, rookie ""made man"" and veteran airhead Christopher caves into the kid's pleas and uses him as wheel man in a stickup! This stuff gives ""Goodfellas"", ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight"" and ""Johnny Dangerously"" a good run for their money without being as broadly doofy as any of them. It retains enough rough stuff played straight to remind you that it isn't quite a comedy. And the series humanizes The Mob in a way that's never to my knowledge been done before. Yeah yeah, I know that ""The Godfather"" showed that hoods could feel pain and could mourn their dead in a vulnerable rather than tough-guy manner, but when did the Corleone home suffer a flooded basement due to a ruptured water heater?",1032566400,5,2093,4.644204851752021

1723766,4,B000067S1H,"The thing that strikes me most about this season as opposed to the previous two seasons is that the tone is far darker.  One of the big themes is the dark pall cast over the entire family follwing the events of the last episode of the second season.  The absence of some of the more interesting chracters of the previous two seasons; like Big Pussy, Richie and of course, Livia creates a bit of a vacuum that's difficult to get used to.  Fortunately, the series stays afloat by working harder and smarter than the previous two seasons.
While the series has lost a lot of it's humor, it's gained a lot of subtlety and complexity.  A lot of the characters that were window dressing in previous episodes now have something to say and do rather than fill stereotypes.  A lot of the best performances come from unexpected players or walk-ons.  Tony's new love affair provides one of the better twists and the best performance of the season from Annabella Sciorra.  While not ""as funny"" as the previous seasons, there are a few episodes which are absolutely hysterical.  The best single episode of the entire series is ""The Pine Barrens"" directed by Steve Buscemi (directors commentray included).  This one is almost worth the price of the entire set.
I also think one of the big differences between this season and the prvious two is that it's not as self-contained.  By the end of the series, there are a lot of hanging thread and sub-plots that almost guarantee Season 4 will be the most intense season yet.  This is still the best series on TV.  I can't think of anything that's come before or since that even came close. If you've never seen an episode, you don't know what you're missing.",1032134400,2,1688,4.608695652173913
1723767,5,B000067S1H,"Through out television history there have been certain shows that have defined a genre: Law and Order, Seinfeld, etc. But none have come close to the defining television show: The Sopranos. Filled with witty and subtle humor, the Sopranos launches the viewer into a world filled the glamourous and the not so glamourous world of the mafia Family the Sopranos and its counterparts.
The show stars James Gandolfini as panic attack ridden Tony Soprano. What most people don't know about Tony is that he runs two families, his blood family, which consists of daughter Meadow, son Anthony Jr and wife Carmela, and his other Family, worker Paulie Walnuts, nephew Christopher Multisanti, consiligere Silvio Dante and Uncle Junior Corrado Soprano.
Season 3 starts right where season 2 left off, with the F.B.I investigating a murder. Although the feds try to tap their house, they get foiled, as with almost all of the goverments attempts to stop the mafia family. A new character that takes the place of fallen Richie Aprile (may God rest his soul) is the volitile Ralphy Ciffareto who is played by the talented actor Joe Pantaliano of Memento fame.
Lorranie Braco (GoodFellas) plays Tony's sexy psychicatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Tony first came to her about panic attacks, but soon finds out more about himself than he could ever know. Jason Cebranone plays the tough but very dumb son of the great Jackie Aprile, Jackie Jr. Annabela Sciorra plays the all too familiar Gloria Trillo.
Although this season doesn't get into the mafia aspects as much as the other two, it dwells into the differant characters more. Hilarity comes when Carmela joins Tony at therapy and Paulies does a little sniffing around.

This series just keeps getting better and better.  In spite of being involved in a violent lifestyle, each character comes across as very human.  I relate to them all.  And somehow, the writing is so good that I feel I'm right there, a member of the family.  These episodes fit together beautifully, and are part of the great mosaic that has been delighting viewers for the past three years.  I just recently became an HBO subscriber and actually saw only one or two episodes before the season ended.  But I'm all caught up now, after also viewing Seasons One and Two on DVD and can't wait to watch it week by week as the Season Four begins.
One of the things I love most about the series is the depth of understanding the writers have of human nature.  The action of the story is true to the personalities of each character.

I've come to love Carmela with all her soul searching about her role of a Mafia wife.  And of course there is Tony with all his humanity, and some very erotic scenes with a seemingly sophisticated new lady friend.  Their relationship sparks and then disintegrates quite quickly and the attraction followed by repulsion was easy to understand.  Tony's children and his family life keep getting more interesting.  Meadow is at college now and has to deal with new relationships while still tied to the familiar.  And A.J. is showing signs of the same kind of panic attacks that affect his father. Tony's mother dies in the first episode and what follows regarding his sister's Janet's reaction is exactly the kind of scatterbrained nonsense mixed with cruelty that we've all come to expect from her.
Tony's Mafia family is still true to what we've come to expect.  This year it's Ralphie we all love to hate. And then there's Jackie Jr. whose stupidity leads to tragedy. Tony still has feelings of guilt about previous acts of violence.  But I just love the fact that there are flashbacks instead of some of the silly dream sequences that appeared in episodes during the first two years.
As a total package, this third year gets another super high recommendation.  Don't miss it.  But be sure to see the first two years in order to put it all in perspective.",1031270400,5,2747,4.693110647181628

1723792,4,B000067S1H,"We're unable to get cable or satellite where we live, and thus were long anticipating the arrival of season three on DVD. This weekend, we had a Sopranos-Fest and watched the entire season in two sittings. While there were of course some truly exceptional episodes (in both writing and direction,) this season seemed to lack a strong dramatic driving force; there is much vague disgruntlement amongst the troops, and inexplicable actions on many peoples' parts. Still the relationships between the players remain as tangible and compelling as always, and perhaps that's more the point of the season, rather than dramatic developments. The strong relationships between characters is one of my favorite things about this show, but I did feel that there weren't many climactic points in this season. Still, the strength of the show pulls it through.
There is the usual humor (subtle and laugh-out-loud,) and James Gandolfini is absolutely brilliant, as always; we've all come to know Tony so well, and Gandolfini absolutely *lives* in that character. Likewise, the other cast members do an outstanding job.  Meadow's development is particularly interesting this season, as she goes off to college, tries new paths, and even falls in love.
Joey ""Pants"" is a welcome addition to the cast, and does a fabulous job playing the psychotic and manipulative Ralphie.
I particularly enjoyed the episodes remembering Big [word], and tracing back when it was that he first flipped for the FBI, and the one directed by Steve Buscemi (which had a great homage to ""Miller's Crossing."")
The season finale doesn't have any ""cliffhanger"" aspects per se, but there are some interesting questions left open that sort of buzz around in my head like noisy little flies; how will Tony ""save"" Anthony Junior? How far will Paulie's anger take him? Will Meadow seek help for her problem? When and how will Ralphie get his come-uppance? Is Christopher truly as disillusioned as he seems? Sadly, I'll have to wait until season four is released on DVD to find out. Madonne!
The ""special features"" on the set are pretty sad, and the featurette is truly disappointing - about 5 minutes of terribly brief interviews by Karen Duffy. I was really hoping for a longer,  more informative featurette, offering more insight into the series and the people behind it. Alas. The next time we run it through, we'll do the audio commentary, and perhaps that will give me exactly what I'm looking for.
At any rate, Sopranos fans shouldn't be disappointed with this latest batch o'mafia joy - even though I had some minor issues with some of it, we did sit down and watch it all within 24 hours, so obviously it has good entertainment value.",1030838400,3,2694,4.971175166297117
1723793,2,B000067S1H,the third Season had alot of Promise but it was more overall Hype than actual Substance. I think they wacked the wrong people.the show kinda limped a bit minus His Presence last year to me overall.it just seemed a step or two off the past year.the first Season to me was a Solid A.the 2nd Season A- but last Year to Me was very Average in alot of Spots.so when the 15nth comes around it will be interesting to see how it bounces back.the show is well written&Developed but it was missing some fire&passion overall to me.,1030838400,,520,4.371134020618556

1723797,5,B000067S1H,"I'm in the middle of watching the third season at the moment...and from what I seen so far...it's still got the suspense, humor and mafia-style violence that makes The Sopranos' a show worth paying attention from beginning to end.
There's so many parts of the Sopranos' that are still in this third season such as the panic attacks, the determination of the FBI to arrest Tony Soprano, the occasional mob hit and the good looking shrink...it deserves to be watch over and over again and again.",1030665600,,493,4.744186046511628

1723800,5,B000067S1H,"(THE GOOD) I think this season brought out the most interesting and talented part in the actors and actresses. The way the story was written, it was taken from real-life experience, and the problems that were happening in Tony's family, was a problem that each family faces everyday of their life. (THE BAD) I really didn't notice any links to the past series, the series from this season somehow didn't connect with the older seasons & their series. Also, I really thought there was too much violence towards women this season.",1030492800,,528,4.813186813186813
1723801,5,B000067S1H,"In just the first two episodes of Season Three:
Livia dies -- but doesn't stop causing trouble for Tony.
Christopher gets his ""button"" -- but learns that being a bad guy isn't all it's made out to be.
Meadow goes off to college -- and discovers being a mobster's daughter has some advantages.
The Feds plant a bug in Tony's favorite conference room.
Oh, yeah -- and Carmella is now sitting on the couch with Tony, across from Dr. Melfi.
Sound like enough?  You better believe it is, and that's just the start.  The Sopranos was, and remains, the most detailed, luscious, involving drama on TV.  Ever.  Period.
Season Three is a little more straightforward than the lovely meanders and sidestreets we saw in Season Two, and most viewers will probably prefer it that way.
But hurry!  Season Four starts broadcasting on September 15, 2002, so you'll want to get caught up ASAP.",1030406400,2,874,4.686274509803922
1723802,5,B000067S1H,"This is still among the best TV out there.  Why H.B.O. has kept us waiting more than a year is a mystery to me (maybe they were tired of winning so many Oscars?).  This release is timed, it appears to coincide with the new season commencing in November.
The inconsistency felt by the main characters mirrors our feelings about them, and for me it is what makes them so incredibly compelling.  We sympathize (at least, I do) with them on the one hand while disapproving of their choices with the other.  The complexity for me is they key; the lines between good and evil are clear in my mind, but blurred in each of the characters surrounding patriarch Tony.  It does present any number of paths (not just the clear right and wrong) that he, his family and supporters may choose.
Others have discussed the major themes in the season.  Richie Aprile is gone, his Father still wanting to hold onto the reins of power.  Richie's son, meanwhile, eschews a life of college for a life following in the family footsteps.  One bane of Tony's existence is gone but not forgotten (his Mother, who, through the magic of television is with us just one more time), and another, his sister Janice (and somnambulist mooching boyfriend) take her place.  A.J. has become a stud football player but almost overnight becomes a loser in school (almost headed to a Military Academy for the struggling adolescent).  Tony's shrink, Dr. Melfi gets him involved with anther patient who is more in need of an army of shrinks than Tony, his Mother, his sister and all of New Jersey.
What makes the show work as it does is their interplay.  As but one example, the F.B.I. has a huge initiative aimed at taking down the Family.  Meadow, after seeming years of angst decides upon Columbia University.  These two end up hilariously intertwined (when will the suits realize that TV is actually funnier WITHOUT a laugh track?)  when the effort to bug the Soprano household ends up getting her dorm conversations and little else.
But, a couple of the characterizations have run their course for me.  Meadow really tired me out two years ago, and has not improved herself.  Her life is so totally ruined, all because of her mean old Dad.  At least Carmella acknowledges the cognitive dissonance in her life (OK, maybe a priest AND a shrink of her own do help). Meadow is sufficiently self centered to blame him for ruining her high school graduation night because that is also the night when the Feds to come to the house to arrest him!  I kinda wish she had gone off to school in Burma, and we only see her through an occasional post card.  Ditto with Tony's new foil, Ralph Cifaretto.  One more scene with him, and I will want to join the Mob just so that I may blow his brains out.  Actually the best would be for that testosterone and coke-laden Christopher Molasanto to try and whack him, and letting them end up killing reach other!
I may be guilty of expectations too high, but this Season left me a bit underwhelmed.  I think too many loose ends were left.  Given the buildup, we could have had a three hour season finale.  It should have explained what happened to the Russian that Paulie and Christopher ended up trying to kill (and his Boss, who was a Soprano ""ally"").
I would have had Furio Giunta (the young enforcer who came back with Tony from the old country, who has become my favorite character) kill the unkillable Russian and his Boss, and then brutalize the kid who raped Dr. Melfi (how could they EVER leave that thread as they did?).  How about some  realization for either A.J. or Meadow that the life ends for too many folks like it did for Jackie Aprile, and an awful lot of bitter comes with the sweet they have perceived as entitlement?
Great writing, though.  Don't take my word for it: go to the ""memorable quotes"" link (the censors probably would remove most of them from this review anyway.  Given what we did have this season, it would have been great TV for almost any other show (N.Y.P.D.-Blue should be so filled with compelling stories). But for this show, were we have come to expect nothing less, it left me wanting to tie up more.  I am not sure we need a ""Who shot J.R.?"" like another reviewer suggests, but the end of season left too much to be resolved for my particular tastes.  I guess that will make this upcoming season all the better.",1030147200,4,4346,4.548843187660668

Everyone seems to be rating based on the first two seasons or the Entire Show in general and that's just wrong. This particular season was extremely dissappointing to say the least. After every episode it left you wanting so much more out of it, and to PLEASE end the SOLID concentration on Meadow and her Relationship Problems. Once you finally got a few Excellent Plot twists, they ignored them and moved on making you think, ""Oh man, the Season Finale is gonna be HUGE!!"" - But like the whole season, they ignore all the GREAT Possibilities, and stick with giving you an average and dull episode! This Season does boast one Great Episode, the One where Paulie and Christopher get lost in the woods with the Russian. Isn't it Ironic that the Best Episode is the only one where they Concentrate on the GANG the whole time and not Meadow Saprano?? I hope they take a hint with this for Season 4. The finale COULDA had the Russian, COULDA had the Psycho Car-Dealer, SHOULDA had a Cliff-Hanger Death... But alas... it Didn't.",1027641600,20,1089,4.589743589743589

And while I have enthusiastically pre-ordered season III, it is inescapable that there were, to quote Davie Scatino, a few ""studder steps"" in the writing-- most notably in the final episode.  With all the great lead-ins from the season, this finale had the potential to be the two-hour classic-cliffhanger- blockbuster-extravaganza that made you thank the lord above you were an HBO subscriber.
But, alas, it was not to be.  So many things were left unresolved that I thought there just had to be a Sopranos movie in the offing for Summer '02 (plus the fact that season IV would keep us waiting for nearly 18 months--what's up with that?).  And there was no insider nudge, as if to say, ""we didn't forget about Dr. Melfi and the deli worker, but that's next season Bub.""
Straying from the mob genre for a moment, the writers on ""Dallas"" sure knew how to end a season.  Unfortunately, for the writers on The Sopranos, TNN stopped airing it once they bought a Porsche, had a facelift and started dating someone named Suzi.
Bottom line, order this set now!  But feel free to skip the last episode in the series--that hour would best be spent doing something infinitely more exciting, like reading the charter of the International Brotherhood of Waterbuffalo, or trimming the hair on your back (whether you have it or not).",1025136000,6,1508,4.758620689655173
