5008133,3,B006NVU7OY,"Masterpiece Mystery (PBS) has announced that it will air the three episodes of AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE - Series 6 on Sundays in September 2014.  (The season was available for UK television viewers in January 2014). Series 6 may be the final one of Marple on Mystery. After its airing in the UK, BBC announced they had acquired the rights for the production of Agatha Christie adaptations, suggesting that ITV/WGBH would be unable to make a seventh installment. The three episodes starring the robust and often hatless Julia McKenzie as the spinster sleuth are as follows:

First up is an adaptation of the only full-length remaining Marple novel of twelve for Mystery, A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY (1964) filmed in Cape Town, South Africa, with beach scenes shot at Boulders Beach, a sheltered area known for its African penguins. Supporting cast includes Antony Sher as Jason Rafiel, Oliver Ford Davies as Major Palgrave, and Robert Webb and Charity Wakefield as the owners of the hotel. As the Christie plot goes, Miss Marple has suffered a bout of ill health and has been afforded a vacation in a warmer climate by her favorite nephew. Bored and longing for something exciting to happen, she listens to another guest, a retired detective, tell a rather unusual story about a man who got away with murder more than once.  Before he can fish a photo of the man from his wallet, he suddenly stops and changes the subject abruptly. The next day, when one of the maids finds the detective dead in his room, Miss Marple stops her knitting, suspects murder, and interviews the British owners of the hotel and the other guests...including tycoon Jason Rafiel who is suffering from a weak heart and confined to a wheelchair; Jackson, his nurse attendant and valet; and Esther, his secretary.

A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY has been adapted for television two other times. In 1983 Helen Hayes was Miss Marple in a teleplay written by Sue Grafton made for American viewers; Barnard Hughes was Mr Rafiel.  A BBC TV adaptation in 1989 starred Joan Hickson as part of the series, AGATHA CHRISTIE's MISS MARPLE, with Donald Pleasance co-starring as Mr Rafiel. Both Hayes and Hickson wore the traditional elderly spinster costumes of the times including appropriate headwear.

The second episode is ""Greenshaw's Folly,"" the last short story of six in THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS PUDDING, a collection first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in October of 1960. The Folly is a large English estate that was built in the 1860s or 1870s by an eccentric botanist who had made an immense fortune but had little idea of architectural style. Christie's essential story is maintained with some embellishments of characters from an earlier story, ""The Thumb Mark of St. Peter."" Miss Marple sends an old family friend and her son for refuge from an abusive husband to the labyrinth estate for care and employment by the elderly Miss Katherine Greenshaw, the last surviving Greenshaw. Miss Marple uncovers the past and present secrets of the estate and its owners and solves a murder.

And finally in episode three is a dramatization of Dame Agatha's ENDLESS NIGHT, published as a novel in 1967 and one of her favorite tales of psychological suspense. Again, the setting is an English estate, a modern dream house built for a young penniless drifter by his wealthy American wife. Told by the man in first person narrative, Christie's novel contains a most clever plot device that only occurs in one other of her tales. Miss Marple is nowhere to be found in the pages. (Dame Agatha will no doubt roll over in her grave every time this episode is shown.) You may want to prepare for this episode by reading the original novel and considering a viewing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ENDLESS-NIGHT/dp/B000059LGD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ENDLESS NIGHT</a>, a 1972 full-length film starring Hywel Bennett, Hayley Mills, Britt Ekland, and George Sanders (in his last role).

You may have noticed that all three tales of this series were adapted from novels and a story first published in the 1960s...tales written when Christie was her seventies. Directors and screenwriters have been playing with images of Miss Marple and distorting the plots since British stage actress Gracie Fields was the first Miss Marple in a 1956 NBC Goodyear Playhouse production of A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED.  There is some comparison in this latest portrayal to an earlier one: Julia McKenzie is very similar in stature to the quirky 70 year-old Margaret Rutherford who wore her own clothing during filming. She also had her husband inserted as a reoccurring character ""Mr. Springer"" in her four comedic films beginning with MURDER SHE SAID in 1961. Rutherford's films, of course, bore little resemblance to the Christie novels.

If you are a fan of Joan Hickson's portrayal of Christie's beloved character, rest assured that you are in good company. Dame Agatha herself was very vocal in her disapproval of several of Miss Marple's depictions. She had written Jane Marple in the novels as a prim and birdlike elderly woman in tweed suit, hat and sensible shoes: a perfect description of Joan Hickson who played the role for television from 1984 to 1992. (Christie once remarked ""Someday I would like you to play my Miss Marple"" to a young Joan Hickson she had seen on-stage in her play, ""Appointment with Death."") Fortunately for devoted fans, Hickson can be seen on DVD in nine of the Miss Marple novels in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MARPLE-THE-CLASSIC-MYSTERY-COLLECTION/dp/B000CRR36K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MARPLE; THE CLASSIC MYSTERY COLLECTION</a>; a 2012 collection of DVD's for sale on Amazon UK contains all twelve of the Marple novels with Joan Hickson.

My favorite Miss Marple?  The grande dame of American theater, Helen Hayes.  Seeing her in A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY in 1983 is still vivid to me...it was my first viewing of a Miss Marple film adaptation. My goodness, that was thirty-one years ago.",1400889600,58,6051,5.162244897959184
5008134,5,B006NVU7OY,"Does anyone know when Marple 6 will be available to purchase here in the USA?  I'm an avid fan of Christies; I ave collected all the Poirot series, with the exception of series 13, whose release date seems to be causing quite a bit of controversy.  I own all of the independent mysteries and am frankly rather sad that this will be the last Marple series to be produced.  Since they've become so comfortable placing Marple into mysteries that didn't originally include her, I was kinda hoping they may try a hand at making a Marple version of ""N Or M"", ""Crooked House"" or ""Death Comes As the End"". Anyway, if anyone does know of a release date for Marple 6, please share it with me.  Much thanks!!",1400457600,3,697,4.421875
5008135,3,B006NVU7OY,"Julia McKenzie is a wonderful actress, and she could be a terrific Miss Marple if the people who produce the Miss Marple mysteries would
produce AGATHA CHRISTIE'S stories.  McKenzie is better than Geraldine McEwen, who could have been a good  Miss Marple, but the
adaptations done for her were absurd.  For example, in 'At Bertram's Hotel,"" we have a black singer touring Europe with her piano case,
twins, etc.  None of these are in the original story.  This latest series with Julia McKenzie suffers from poor adaptations.  It is worth seeing.
What Julia McKenzie and Geraldine McEwen needed were the writers who adapted Miss Marple for Joan Hickson.  I am sure that the
present day writers/adapters think they have improved Agatha Christie.  Compared to Miss Christie, such people are amateurs.",1397779200,8,797,5.076923076923077
5008136,3,B006NVU7OY,"First, a little bit about what formed my opinion...I love Agatha Christie's books.  I also love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  These two loves have influenced how I feel about the Miss Marple films featuring the talented Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie.  For me, the story is what's important.

As much as I love the Hickson versions, I believed there was room for improvement, minor tweaking, freshening up, but by no means rewrites of Christie's work.  All are really showing their age.  I was looking forward to the remakes.  Christie's work is so great that I was excited about having it brought to the high definition era.  I was not disappointed in the appearance of the remakes.  On the other hand, I was not happy with the content changes in most of the remakes.  Some were good, some were okay, and then there were the bad.

No matter how hard I try to be objective about these remakes and not make comparisons to the books and the Hickson versions, I find I can't. I found myself watching and muttering things like, ""What?! Miss Marple did not have an adulterous affair!"" About other characters, ""they weren't married, an alcoholic, divorced, the murderer, a Nazi..."" to name but a few.

McKenzie is a ""softer"" Miss Marple than Hickson and I like this a lot. She really does shine as Miss Marple.  Where Hickson gave a serious, unsmiling, austere, and flinty portrayal; McKenzie is more approachable, and to me, she added an increased believability of Miss Marple being everyone's Auntie Jane. All in all, I love her as Miss Marple.

In Series Six we see the final remake of the Hickson twelve, A Caribbean Mystery.  While there were alterations galore made to the original, the main plot and characters remained the same, these being; Jason Rafael, his secretary, his physical therapist, Major Palgrave, Molly & Tim Kendall, Greg & Lucky Dyson, Edward & Lynne Hillingdon, and Victoria. If you are not familiar with the story, we see Aunt Jane in Barbados.  Her generous nephew, Raymond, has sent her there to aid in her recovery from a bad bout of arthritis. (In the original, she went there for a ""pig of a bronchitis."")  During her stay, a fellow guest suddenly dies.  Jane has reason to believe it is murder but the local Inspector does not.  She enlists the help of fellow guest, Jason Rafael, a self-made multi-millionaire to try and persuade the police otherwise.  The Inspector practically tosses them out of his office as old crackpots.  When another murder takes place, Jane is convinced that unless the killer is identified, even more will die.  With no help from the police, she sets out on her own, to ascertain the culprit.  How many and who will die?

The differences between the original and the new that bothered me the most are: 1. The attitude of the Police Inspector; in the original he had heard of Miss Marple through Sir Henry Clithering (once head of CID at the Met,) who said, ""She is the best personality analyst in the world and she has a ruthless forensic brain."" When Jason Rafael informed the Barbados Inspector of her presence upon the island, his response was, ""Magnificent!"" In the new version, the Inspector had no use for Miss Marple or the rich and powerful Rafael.  2. There is no mention of Nemesis!  This is integral.  How could they forget this when the mention of Nemesis in A Caribbean Mystery is the basis for the follow-up titled, Nemesis!  I give, A Caribbean Mystery, three stars even though the filming is absolutely stunning and the supporting cast, as always, is brilliant.

Episode Two, Greenshaw's Folly, is not based upon a Marple novel and therefore was completely new to me.  In this offering, Jane comes to the rescue of her ""niece"" Louisa, who is running away from her abusive husband with her young son, Archie.  Auntie Jane finds refuge for them at Greenshaw's Folly, the home of her friend, Katherine Greenshaw, the daughter of the eminent scientist, Decimus Greenshaw.  Luckily for Louisa, Katherine is in need of a secretary.  Louisa can ""hide out"" in Katherine's country home, tagged Greenshaw's Folly by the locals.  The home is shrouded in mystery.  There is a hidden and locked laboratory that holds terrible secrets of Decimus' past. Not long after their arrival, and while Jane is still there, what happens?  Murder.  Yay! It is left to Jane to continue to protect her charges and uncover the killer.  Once again, Jane is on her own while the local Inspector pooh-pooh's all of her ideas and observations.  I loved it; five stars.  Should more Miss Marple films be made, I would be elated if they shadowed Greenshaw's Folly.  I love Jane and I want to see more of her with McKenzie.

The final episode, Endless Night, was a fail for me.  It was dark.  It had a film noir feeling and used narration by the main character, an impoverished young man with big dreams of wealth, to tell the story.  Miss Marple is oddly placed within the story.  She would just pop up here and there, into the life of this man.  Ultimately, she was in the story often enough to figure out whodunit when no one else could.  For me, it didn't work.  Everything revolved around this young man, which in and of itself is okay, but what wasn't okay is the way Miss Marple was fitted into the story.  It was not about Miss Marple.  I was also put off by the darker and sinister tone it just wasn't what I was expecting. I give Endless Night two stars.

Let's add it up...A Caribbean Mystery was okay, I wish it had followed the story and mentioned Nemesis: 3 stars.  I loved Greenshaw's Folly: 5 stars. Endless Night was a bit ""dark"" for me and Miss Marple's part seemed forced and odd: 2 stars.  Overall, 3.33 stars.",1395792000,96,5669,4.672727272727273
5008137,4,B006NVU7OY,"I think Joan Hickson is the sweetest miss marple which is nice. You want Miss Marple to be a good person as well as a smart one. This has always been my favourite portrayal.
Their styling is so wonderful, I love the agatha christies for that alone. It'll be interesting to watch what they've put together for these final episodes. (I hate the seedy stuff but it's a wonderful show).",1395273600,7,382,4.4714285714285715
5008138,3,B006NVU7OY,"Greenshaw's Folly holds one's interest somewhat (a cobbling together of two Christie stories), the Caribbean Mystery was much better-realized with Joan Hickson, and Endless Night, one of Christie's really stupid stories, doesn't even have Miss Marple in it.  So, just add her.  Who cares, right?  Supposedly this is the final entry in the ""Marple"" series.  Pity that it is really disappointing.  As for Julie McKenzie, she provides her usual fuddy-duddy-ness in great detail but the stories are so bad she seems to be an outsider looking in rather than a real participant in the dramas.  Poirot is finished and now, apparently, so is Marple.  This last Marple entry really scrapes the bottom of the barrel.",1393459200,17,706,5.086956521739131
5008139,4,B006NVU7OY,"Watching the Marple series can be a bit confusing since they are often very much adaptations of various Christie mysteries and are not, in other words, strict filmed representations of actual written Agatha Christie works.

Thus `Greenshaw's Folly' was actually a short story and this TV adaptation of it combines the story with another story by the name of The Thumb Mark of St. Peter (from the book The 13 Problems).

Then herein we have `Endless Night' which was a complete novel of Agatha's Christie's, but Miss Marple did not at all appear in that novel.

And finally we have 'A Carribbean Mystery,' which was both a novel of Agatha Christie and one that actually had Miss Marple in it!

Julia McKenzie is fun to watch so it is refreshing that In the included episodes herein at least the identities of the various killers have not been changed like they have in other series episodes of Marple adaptations. It's actually a refreshing treat that in this Marple series, consequently, one can watch Ms. McKenzie be Agatha's Christie's Miss Marple without all the changes of location, characters and identities of various killers that British Television's ITV network has wrought on other 'adaptations' of Agatha Christie's actual work that it produces under the 'Marple' monicker.

5008142,3,B006NVU7OY,The actors and Ms. McKenzie were absolutely splendid. The set and costumes ditto. The writers were at great fault for imagining that they could outdo Agatha Christie! If the plot is written badly there is little that the actors and other contributors can do. If they think that they can write better mysteries than Agatha Christie why did they not write their own stories? In the whole history of the world it has never ever been easier to write and be published in various ways than in this era. Really... if the writers are greater than Agatha Christie let them do exactly what they like with their own work rather than pass it off under someone else's hard won name.,1497657600,2,669,4.583333333333333

I appreciate the extra packaging for protection, but I often enjoy hitting the 'play all' option on disks that have several episodes recorded on them, and letting them play all evening.    Another slight disappointment was entirely my own fault.  I am not always familiar with the titles of the episodes, and when I viewed 'Endless Night,' realized it was an episode I had not liked at all!!  Good actors, well acted, but way too dark for my taste.
On the other hand, I liked this version of 'A Caribbean Mystery' better than the Joan Hickson version, mostly for technical reasons.  The earlier version had loud screeching repeatedly on the soundtrack.  I could never determine if it was supposed to be some sort of tropical bird, or a metal-on-metal awning or shutter flapping in the wind, but it sometimes drowned out the dialogue!
'Greenshaw's Folly' was my favorite of this set, and the real reason I bought the Series 6.  Great story, plenty of interest and suspense in the various story lines, and the actors (lots of favorites in the cast)  had the 50's feel down pat.",1474761600,,1223,4.694835680751174

5008228,5,B006NVU7OY,"Marple was just an amazing series. While I at one time 20 years ago had read Christie's entire Marple works, only during one episode did I recall who the murderer was and spoil it for myself - simply because the names had not been changed.

Season 1-3 with Geraldine McEwan was potentially my favorite simply because I enjoyed several of the episodes more. McEwan brought a smug, un-emotional, unyielding and brilliant side to Miss Marple, whereas Julia McKenzie visually was much more like Gilbert Wilkinson's illustration and brought an emotional empathy McEwan lacked. She also seemed less brilliant female Sherlock Holmes hermit (McEwan) and more friendly and fashionable older knitting circle lady - with her clothing choices making for much more visually appealing episodes. (If I have to see that hat on McEwan Marple again in another color I will plotz).

I personally did not mind the changes since it had been so long I was neither spoiled nor expecting an exact re-telling of the canon. However I was truly disappointed to hear there would be no more episodes so I do hope BBC will bring in their own ""Dr. Who"" Marple to showcase another three seasons.",1468972800,,1163,4.898477157360406

She plays her character as an intelligent spinster rather than a fluffy one ..... as Miss Marple is often depicted in the Christie novels.
""Endless Night"" is the best of the set....it follows very closely to the novel.
""A Caribbean Mystery"" was not very enjoyable...I much preferred the simpler version with Helen Hayes and Barnard Hughes.
""Greenshaw's Folly"" was close to the novel too but I found it a little slow.
If you are a die hard then by all means give it a look but this is one set you may not keep after you watch once.",1464912000,2,695,4.523809523809524

The book was not written as a Marple mystery, nor did it feature Barnard's Robbie Hayman as a character. To be honest, I enjoyed the addition of both, but neither was truly necessary as the book was meaty enough to begin with. Other than these additions, the story follows the book fairly well (from what I can remember) and was superbly done.

5008272,4,B006NVU7OY,"Three final mysteries featuring Jane Marple (Julia McKenzie).  The first is the oft-filmed A Caribbean Mystery.  The second was adapted from two Christie short stories (Greenshaws Folly and The Thumb Mark of St. Peter) and turned into a single episode.  The last movie isn't even one that featured Marple: Endless Night.  They awkwardly shoehorned Jane into the plot, narrated by the main character, and it feels exactly like they just shoved the old lady into place by having her unconvincingly pop up now and again to interrupt the flow of the story (a vain attempt to remind you that she was lurking in the brush, waiting for her cue).  They took an interesting mystery and tampered with it to the point that it was almost laughable.  They took more than their fair share of liberties with this one.
Otherwise, quite entertaining, especially Greenshaws Folly.",1462406400,,862,4.951388888888889

I would return this if I could. or at least dump it in the trash.  Hard to follow the plot, too many actors that run around doing nothing, but that add to the confusion with the story line.  Also, trivial but nevertheless confusing, the actors appear to have been chosen from the same page in the Casting book.  They all look quite similar, so is hard to keep the various characters separate.  Casting is an important part of the production process.  Not all women should be long haired with perfect features and No. 10 bodies.  Is it that real looking character actors cost more???

For me, it was the scrips, production.  As a previous reviewer said, I did not feel as if she (Miss Marple) was a part of the story.  It was as if she was dropped in by parachute and forced into the story.

5008391,4,B006NVU7OY,"Julia McKenzie returns as the spinster sleuth in ""Agatha Christie's Marple"" Series 6 (or Season 7 in the US). This series comprises three 90-minute mysteries: ""A Caribbean Mystery"", based on Christie's 1964 Marple novel. ""Greenshaw's Folly"", based on the 1960 Marple short story. And ""Endless Night"", based on Christie's 1967 novel that does not feature Miss Marple. McKenzie reprises her amiable, practical interpretation of Miss Marple. She doesn't have much personality, so it's left to the supporting cast to generate interest. They do, but the plots were crafted as vehicles for Miss Marple, which leaves these mysteries in the realm of entertaining but not exceptional. ""Greenshaw's Folly"" is padded with superfluous subplots about an abused wife and a mad scientist's gruesome polio research. Both are overtly political, and the writers seem preoccupied with victimhood. Miss Marple is barely present in ""Endless Night"", which would have been better without her. Otherwise, it is a strong film with an impressive performance by Tom Hughes. The mysteries are:

In ""A Caribbean Mystery"", Miss Marple travels to the Island of St. Honoree to improve her rheumatism. At the Golden Palms resort, operated by Molly (Charity Wakefield)  and Tim Kendall (Robert Webb), during an evening of food and live entertainment, fellow guest Maj. Palgrave (Oliver Ford Davies) talks Miss Maple's ear off recounting his adventures and showing photos. He mentions a rumor that a man in the background of one of the photos had murdered two of his wives. Suddenly, he recognizes someone from the photo and breaks off the conversation. Maj. Palgrave dies in the night. Unconvinced of the cause of death, Miss Marple questions the other guests, including the wealthy invalid Mr. Jason Raphiel (Anthony Sher). Together they conclude that there will be another murder. They are unable to convince the local police investigator (Anele Matoti), so they endeavor to find the next victim before the murderer strikes. The colors of the sea, sky, painted buildings and brightly-hued automobiles are striking. The intermittent weird, menacing graphics are not.

""Greenshaw's Folly"" finds Miss Marple trying to help a young friend, Louisa Oxley (Kimberly Nixon), who has fled her abusive husband with their young son Archie (Bobby Smalldridge). Thinking that no one will find them there, Miss Marple asks Katherine Greenshaw (Fiona Shaw), who is compiling a codex of medicinal plants, if she will take Louisa on as a secretary at her home Greenshaw's Folly. Miss Greenshaw agrees, and the Oxleys are installed in the cavernous mansion, also occupied by Miss Greenshaw's nephew Nat Fletcher (Sam Reid), an actor at a local theater. Shortly after, the butler Walter Cracken (Vic Reeves) is killed while changing a light bulb, apparently drunk. Miss Greenshaw finds that odd, as Cracken had not drunk in years. Meanwhile, an architectural historian named Horace Bindler (Rufus Jones) is doing research in the house, but seems to be poking around in the papers of Miss Greenshaw's father Decimus, who was a polio researcher in his time. The addition of the polio research angle doesn't come off well.

""Endless Night"" is narrated by Mike Rogers (Tom Hughes), who relates the story of how he met his wife Ellie (Joanna Vanderham) in Kingston Bishop in 1956. Miss Marple was there visiting a recently widowed friend, Marjorie Phillpot (Wendy Craig). She encounters Mike on the street, as he is looking at a notice for an auction of ""Gipsy's Acre"", a plot of land with a great view, an old dilapidated country home on it, and a gypsy's curse, or so the legend goes. Mike decides to go out and have a look. He falls in love with the view and then with a young woman he meets there. Ellie Goodman is an American heiress, not yet 21 years old, and she is taken with the charming but decidedly working class and restless Mike. Mike dreams of tearing down the old house at Gipsy's Acre and building a striking, airy modern home. His childhood friend Robbie Hayman (Aneurin Barnard) is an accomplished architect willing to design the house for free, but Mike has no means at the moment. Undeterred, he keeps dreaming about  his dream house and about Ellie.",1412467200,,4215,5.076479076479076
5008392,5,B006NVU7OY,"Jane Marple returns with three new adventures, and it's always a delight to see Julia McKenzie bringing the classic sleuth to life. Although the Marple teleplays are based on Christie's novels and short stories, it's pure fun simply to enjoy them as they are without comparing them or fretting over missing details, especially because the locations offer plenty of enjoyment, along with period accuracy.  ""A Caribbean Mystery"" finds Miss Marple in a sunny, vacation locale for a change, while ""Greenshaw's Folly"" and ""Endless Night"" are classic British tales in the countryside. And of course the other fun part of seeing any new Marple mystery is spotting the guest stars. Fiona Shaw, Oliver Ford Davies and Judy Parfitt (hello Sister Monica Joan!) are just a few of the familiar faces. Settle in with a cuppa, and watch Miss Marple work her magic to ace these new cases.",1412121600,5,872,4.972602739726027
5008393,5,B006NVU7OY,"Each actor who plays a fictional character (or even a real person) brings something of themselves to the role and maybe you learn something about that character that you hadn't thought of before. Examples are Jeremy Brett and Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes or David Suchet and Peter Ustinov as Poirot. We all have our favorite versions. Julia McKenzie has the right combination of intelligence and soft fluffiness to play Marple. She is not schoolmarmish like Joan Hickson or quirky like Geraldine McEwan. I think she is perfect for Carribbean Mystery and it is understandable why people underestimate her and then come to respect her in this story. This, plus the scenery, make for my favorite version of this story and one I will want to revisit. Endless Night (spoiler) is too close to Death on the NIle for me. I like Death on the Nile better - closer to the type of Christie I enjoy. I think putting Marple in this one as the avenging angel that she is in Nemesis, makes for a better story - it would be totally depressing otherwise. But today's audience might like this one - closer to modern mysteries and not very 'cozy' by anyone's standard. I have all the versions of Marple, Holmes and Poirot and enjoy each version. The only problem is that the Marples by necessity have to be older women who don't have the energy to keep up the pace of making all these movies - I understand that since I am old myself. But I could watch another 12 episodes with Julia McKenzie and I'm sorry this is to be her last set.",1412121600,8,1525,4.549090909090909

5008396,3,B006NVU7OY,"Most of us who are diehard Christie fans seem to have differing opinions on the 'best' Miss Marple :) Much to my own surprise, I now think I'd nominate Julia McKenzie for that honor. For me (and I totally respect that preferences vary here!), Julia McKenzie's Marple is warmer and more likable than Joan Hickson's, yet truer to Christie's original conception of the character than the more 'bohemian' and eccentric Geraldine McEwan.

The problem here is one that has consistently plagued this series: the uneven scripts. I'm not one of those fans who thinks the film adaptations have to be slavishly faithful to Christie's original work, but somehow the tone of these movies just feels consistently 'off'---too slick, flashy and melodramatic, and filled with flat, unmemorable characters and lackluster dialogue. (Christie's own gifts for creating amusingly vivid characters and writing sharp, witty dialogue were sadly underrated!) Perhaps it's not all the directors' and scriptwriters' fault; in fairness, I've found that the plots of Christie's original Marple novels tend to pale in comparison to many of her Poirot novels, so perhaps they didn't have Christie's very best material to work with. But I find myself more inclined to reread even the most mediocre Marple novels than rewatch most of the Marple series, which proved strangely disappointing even to someone who's not all that picky when it comes to getting my Christie fix. (I'm one of those who loves both Peter Ustinov AND David Suchet as Poirot, for example!) These are moderately entertaining (with Greenshaw's Folly, based on a Christie short story rather than a novel, the weakest of the bunch for me), but I just can't help but feel that the Marple series could and should have been so much better.",1411344000,5,1770,5.103448275862069
5008397,5,B006NVU7OY,"I have always liked miss marple period . I  thought of her as having a slightly crustier personality, but this version looks how I pictured miss marple appearance wise in my head. It's really hard not to like Julie McKenzie who plays miss marple this time around. She has this charming glint in her eyes  and  looks ready for anything. Its easy to convince the audience that she could get people to talk to her and get to the bottom of things. Most of these are loosely based off the books but for once I don't care . The plots are great  are fast paced and are of movie theater quality.",1411344000,4,587,4.261261261261262
5008398,5,B006NVU7OY,"Maybe because I'm aged like Miss Marple, but I do so enjoy Agatha Christie stories of Marple. Poirot too, but Marple seems more a middle class friend. She's laid back, less arrogant than Poirot, but gets the job done in her own easy-pace way. Beautiful 50s period scenes, costumes, props, and trappings. Will there ever be new Marple remakes with a new Miss Marple? Hope so. For now, this is a must own finale series for Julia McKenzie. Viewers get a guest star-gazing time.

SDH SUBTITLES for all three 90 min. episodes and the ""Behind the Mystery of Endless Night"", 33 min. bonus.
A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY
Death of Maj Palgrave (Oliver Ford Davies) sends Marple's tropical island paradise holiday into investigatory mode with the assistance of old crotchety vacationer industrialist Rafiel (Anthony Sher). They are at the Golden Palms run by the Kendals (Robert Webb & Charity Wakefield). Also staying is a birdwatcher (Alistair MacKenzie -`Monarch of the Glen') and wife (Hermione Norris -`MI-5'), Lucky (MyAnna Buring -`Downton Abbey') and Prescott (Daniel Rigby `Lillies'). This is a redo of this Agatha Christie story also filmed years earlier with Joan HIckson as Marple and Donald Pleasence as Rafiel. Jewelry, clothes, and vehicles indicate the 50s era.

GREENSHAW'S FOLLY
Marple assists a girl (Kimberley Nixon) with her young son in securing a secretary job for a botanist (Fiona Shaw -`Harry Potter') at the estate named as the episode. Soon the butler is killed. Suspicious? A guest historical architect goes missing. More suspicious? Another disaster. Revealing secrets, not ghosts, will solve this crime series. Is it the gardener (Martin Compston -`Great Train Robbery')? Housekeeper (Julia Sawalha -`Larkrise to Candleford')? Other guest stars: Father Brophy (Robert Glenister -`Great Train Robbery') and Cicely (Judy Parfitt -`Call the Midwife').

ENDLESS NIGHT
In 1956 Mike Rogers (Tom Hughes) who narrates his story, dreams of a house on beautiful Gypsy's Acre. When he meets and weds rich American Ellie (Joanna Vanderham -`The Paradise') the brother of a friend Mike tried to save from drowning in 1948 shows as an architect offering services for the debt owed. Gypsy Lee (Janet Henfrey -`Les Mis') warns them off, but is the land gypsy-cursed? Events seem so, and even Marple questions her resolve. Wendy Craig ('Reggie Perrin') also guest stars. Agatha Christie offers a bit of a darker finale, and actually didn't originally include Miss Marple--only in this adaptation--a challenge, but it works for Julia McKenzie's final Marple role.",1410480000,3,2556,5.275184275184275
5008399,5,B006NVU7OY,"I am going to order series 6.  I truly love Miss Marple. As a woman, even these days, I am used to my ideas being appropriated by others (meaning men), being ignored, and because I was raised with good manners and am soft-spoken--generally disregarded. Miss Marple was ""fluffy"", very feminine, wore soft sweatery things and was exceedingly well-mannered which allowed the ignorant to treat her, if not with contempt, with impatience. England has the finest actors in the world, which puzzles me greatly--why has not one of those very good actors who have played this part ever played Miss M. as she was written? Hickson, was downright scary, the others were not dressed appropriately or displayed way more confidence than our dear little detective would feel correct. She was a product of her Victorian upbringing after all. Julia McKenzie is the best so far, and unlike some of the others shows not only the brains but a little of the charm of which Christie endowed her heroine.",1410134400,29,980,4.868263473053892
8501473,5,B006NVU7OY,"Joan Hicks will probably always be my favorite Marple with her gentle face and sharp bird-like eyes, but all of them have been wonderful.  What sets this series, with Julia McKenzie, apart is the wonderful production quality.  Gorgeous settings,  wonderful actors, attention to detail, and a bit of whimsy in the Caribbean mystery -- introducing 'real' people who would later become famous, Ian Fleming for one.  Just a great series.",1524700800,,433,5.142857142857143

8501476,2,B006NVU7OY,"To be fair I picked a bad episode by which to judge the series. I had just finished reading _Endless Night_, so I knew Miss Marple wasn't actually in it. I was curious though and a fan of ""Victoria"" so.... I think I would have been okay with the altered cast of characters, but I couldn't get past this assertive, sleuth-like rendition of Miss Marple. In the novels characters seek out Miss Marple and not the other way around. A classic example would be _The Moving Finger_ where she solves the mystery just listening to the narrator give her a brief report. Furthermore, Miss Marple always solved a mystery by just knowing people because they reminded her of other people, and that concept doesn't really apply in _Endless Night_, but to get into why would spoil the mystery.",1517270400,,777,4.63768115942029
