4204848,5,B003UM8T0I,I have and will always be a fan of Morris Chestnut. From his first movie Boyz N Tha Hood he has captured me and to this day anything he is in I will support. This was good and I always love plays. I recommend this to anyone who needs to let go and move on. Love comes when you least expect it and not looking but like God always on time.,1306022400,2,337,3.76056338028169

4204850,2,B003UM8T0I,"The play gets three stars. The singing gets two stars. The price for the dvd should have been lower. Overall, I give this play two stars because of the singing.",1293667200,4,160,4.366666666666666
4204851,5,B003UM8T0I,"This is an excellent play well done by David E Talbert. He is so different from Tyler Perry so don't compare the two. I was fortunate to see this play live on tour when it stopped in Trenton, NJ 2 years ago. Enjoy. You will feel so many emotions while watching but the most important thing is that you will be entertained. Highly recommend. Everything that David E Talbert puts out is excellent",1293408000,11,394,4.410958904109589
4204852,3,B003UM8T0I,I must say that I actually go this DVD because of Morris Chestnut and it was not what I thought it would be. This was the first play that I have seen on DVD so maybe it just did not have to same affect like if I was actually in the audience. The story line was ok. My husband did not like it atol. To each its own.,1288051200,3,314,3.6323529411764706

4204872,4,B003UM8T0I,"SPOILER ALERT: Wow, very great play!  I wish I would have seen it in person, but hey, at least I saw it!  To the Talberts- I can edit if that's what is needed.  Ms. Dee-Dee said she doesn't talk about her men folk and what they do in the bed, but there was a scene with just her and Tyme, and Dee Dee told all her biz about how long her guy was and how she wasn't going to wait on him. Yeah several innuendos about sex and a penis.  I like the concepts of ""there are still good men out there; forgiveness; and don't take your relationship woes out on your child.""  This play is really geared for us ladies IMHO.  There's a few things in here for the fellas, but not much.  Shout out to the ""Naturalistas"" out there.  As Avant could only sing it-keep your cornrows, afros, and stay away from those chemicals.  Please keep Avant in your plays Mr. Talbert-really enjoyed him and Ms. Ellia!  God Bless!",1460246400,,898,4.1988304093567255

4204897,4,B003UM8T0I,"David E. Talbert's Love in the Nick of Tyme is a nice, well put together stage play. The story flows nice and all comes together. However, there were some things I did dislike about the play. The cast didn't seem to have chemistry which messed up the flow. But it was overall a nice play to watch.",1402531200,,297,4.228070175438597

4204899,3,B003UM8T0I,"Thought this play was well done. There were a Few good laughs. I thought that the main point having love and not cherishing that love was well communicated. I gave it three stars because, although it was an enjoyable play there seemed rot be something lacking and couldn't quite figure what that was. You'll get some laughs and David leaves you with something to ponder.",1399766400,,370,4.707692307692308

4204904,5,B003UM8T0I,this was actually pretty good for a stage play. and the fact that morris was in it was just oooh. i don't like all the singing but it was pretty balanced out so it wasn't too bad.,1369267200,,179,3.864864864864865

4204909,5,B003UM8T0I,David Talbert is another one of my favorite playwrights....  When I saw this play I knew that I had to add it to my collection of plays and movies..

Especially with Mr. Fine himself Morris Chestnut!,1363651200,,337,4.25

4204914,1,B003UM8T0I,"Yup , I am only giving this play 1 star because Morris was in it. The characters are so flat and bland, the play lacks a foundation and substantial plot. Eye candy is about the only positive with this movie, found myself fast forwarding throughout just to skip over the overdramatized singing solos. This was a waste of my time. It was wack wack wackitty wack. The end.",1351123200,,369,4.4411764705882355

4204919,4,B003UM8T0I,"Delivery and communication from seller was great. This play was mediocre at best. It had a great meaning and story line, sometimes it just appeared that the actresses weren't into it as much as maybe i wouldve liked. David E. Talbert is a great writer, producer, slash everything. Keep up the good work.",1325030400,2,303,4.735849056603773
4204920,5,B003UM8T0I,"I absolutely Loved this play.. Morris Chestnut is such a good looking Black man and the cast was simply beautiful. There was some good singing in this play!!! Avant and Trenyce should have ""sang more"" but still great. The story line is one all women can identify with and Love the ending!!! Must add this to your collection.",1317859200,,324,4.603448275862069
