8094778,4,B000BZ8MT0,"This two-DVD set, unlike the first two-pack in the series, Mastering the Miter Saw, did not play the audio track on either of my regular DVD players.  I contacted Gary Katz via email and he informed me that the second two disks were produced with a different system.  I discovered that I could play them on an office computer.  Once the audio was available, I found the material to be presented very well and was very pleased with the product.  Were it not for the compatibility problem, I would give the set five stars.",1154649600,3,520,4.5
