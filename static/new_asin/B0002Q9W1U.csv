2115802,5,B0002Q9W1U,"This is anime that is lots of fun to watch.  While not logistically perfect, it has a lot of sound Submarine tactics and is a gas to watch.  Worth a watch if not a purchase.  I felt it was worth a buy..Maybe you will too.",1265932800,,221,3.8666666666666667

inning was top notch.",1254528000,,94,4.277777777777778
2115804,4,B0002Q9W1U,"Submarine 707 is a decent anime movie, apparently taken from the series, that has yet to be released in the US in its entirety... It is a little campy, but still fun to watch...Two missions by the 707 attached to the peace keeping navy fighting their nemesis the UX...The movie leaves you hanging because no more have been released.",1198368000,,332,4.6440677966101696
2115805,1,B0002Q9W1U,"Two one hour OVA style anime episodes with multiple disjointed story lines, cardboard characters, some extremely cheesy moments, and no real ending...  Spend your time on any of the far more interesting animes out there.  This lacked any direction at all.  Its part rivalry story, part coming of age, and even part ""fan service,"" and none of it is worth watching.  Like another reviewer posted, this seems like a pilot that never got developed... just dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Avoid at all costs unless your a submarine nut, then proceed with extreme caution.",1192752000,2,569,5.01063829787234
2115806,2,B0002Q9W1U,"I really wanted to like this one. It gives the refreshing promise of an anime without goofy love triangles, mecha, or crazy fight scenes involving lots of screaming, powerups and little actual fighting. However 707r can't decide wether it is going to be a military drama, a comedy or a suspense thriller. Too many plot devices are introduced without any follow through, and it is over before you know it and you are left feeling empty. The main Bad Guy (TM) is your typical sociopath bent on ridding the sea of violence and war and he goes about this by destroying all other submarines. Makes sense, huh? Plus he has unlimited resources and no explanation for his motives. The Good Guy (R) is out of place because in contrast to all the serious looking characters, he looks like a goofy cartoon character and is seemingly drawn by another anime team. Yet his skills are far more then they seem and outweigh the fact that his sub (even the later improved one) is supposedly not very cutting edge. The fighting scenes between the subs are well animated and gripping and reminded me of my favroite sub movies like Crimson Tide, Hunt for Red October and Das Boot but in the end, too many plot elments are touched upon, but never explored in depth. I have a feeling this was the pilot to a series that was never produced.",1138579200,6,1316,4.556962025316456
2115807,4,B0002Q9W1U,"In the near future, human colonization of the oceans has resulted in an unparalleled era of peace and prosperity.  However, not all is well in this brave new world - a group of undersea eco-terrorists, known as the USR, seek to end the exploitation of the seas by force of arms.  To combat the terrorists, the UN commissions a peace-keeping navy, but when disaster strikes, the only vessel left to face down the USR is the Japanese Navy's advanced sub 707-R, commanded by ""old-school"" submariner Capt. Youhei Hayami.

The animation is outstanding; the submarines look exceptionally realistic, as do the underwater special effects.  (Look for a great scene where the subs dodge in and out of a thermocline.)  Colors are crisp and well defined, and the animation flows smoothly, without any skips or freeze-frame shots during action sequences.  In the sound department, you have your choice of Dolby 5.1 English dub or Japanese with subtitles; the Japanese voice actors sound a bit better in their roles than the English, but the English track does a better job with ambient noise and the ""atmosphere"" of sound in a submarine.  It's your preference as to which you like better.

All in all, ""Submarine 707R"" is a decent genre flick, in the spirit of ""Silent Service"" and ""Run Silent Run Deep,"" and those who remember the first season of ""seaQuest DSV"" will find more than a few parallels.  (Whether the captain of the UX makes a better Max Scully or Marilyn Stark is your call. :))  It's got amazing battle sequences, a decent premise, and a sprinkling of comedy - a little something for everyone.  Cons include a few massive plot holes, a rather flat ending, and the transition from Part 1 to Part 2, which is somewhat jarring.  However, if you like submarine adventure, you could do far worse than to spend your evening with the 707.",1102032000,10,1833,4.784126984126984

8030663,1,B0002Q9W1U,"This DVD was purchased accidentally. I did not realize it was a cartoon. It was cheap enough so I didn't bother to return it. It sat there for  while as i had zero desire to watch a cartoon. As it turns out, my instincts were correct. It's a total waste of time. It is actually 2 cartoons part 1 and part 2 although they cleverly call it mission 1 and mission 2. It is definitely not for children for several reasons I won't go into but in my main objection is foul language. Having said that I found it confusing to say the least, a strange mix of Japanese and American Navy And at times I could not tell who was who nor did I really care enough to bother. From a Naval accuracy view point, it had none but then again to be fair it is after all a cartoon. The only one who might enjoy this DVD is someone into Japanese cartoons. It's so bad you couldn't give it away at a flea market, I tried!  .",1411516800,,897,4.005586592178771

8030665,1,B0002Q9W1U,"This tv show is the waste of money, I bought it cause I was told by a friend that it was an awesome movie. But it turns out to be a tv series and not some movie, on top of that there is no plot on which direction they were heading with this tv show. You can't tell if its supposed to be a comedy, love drama or a Military drama. I've seen better than this tv show, I was honestly disappointed. Full Metal Panic has more military action in it and has a great story line.",1362268800,,469,3.845360824742268
