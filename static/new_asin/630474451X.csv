7876478,3,630474451X,"WU TANG TEMPLE is the Wu Tang Collection's retitled VHS edition of YOUNG TAOISM FIGHTER, a late entry (1986) in the group of taoist magic-and-kung fu movies mixing special effects and slapstick that were made by the famed Yuen clan and included MIRACLE FIGHTERS, SHAOLIN DRUNKARD (aka WU TANG MASTER) and TAOISM DRUNKARD (aka DRUNKEN WU TANG). The wildly meandering plot here has to do with Wicked Woo, a white-haired wizard who goes to pretty extreme means to develop his power, taking on the Yin-Yang School where our hero (played by Yuen Yat Chor) is developing special powers of his own. There are a number of clever scenes, including one in which Yuen confronts his own astral self which, curiously, seeks to humiliate him. A particularly cute sequence involves talking and dancing turtles, all done in the pre-CGI era with real turtles! Finally, in the climactic battle, a character's dismembered limbs and head continue to fight without a break in the action. The effects are not always the smoothest, but they're consistently imaginative and unpredictable.
One of the main reasons, however, for kung fu fans to want to see this film is its spotlighting of fighting femme Liu Hau Yi as she joins the hero in battling Wicked Woo and is featured in almost as many fight scenes as he is. She's a beautiful and strong presence and she fights with great agility and skill, including doing some of her own acrobatic stunts. The only other starring film of hers I can cite is SHAOLIN CHASTITY KUNG FU (1981), in which she had an even bigger fighting role. Star Yuen Yat Chor easily had the most charm of any of the prodigiously talented members of the Yuen clan (sons of Simon Yuen, the beloved ""Drunken Master"" himself) and he's given ample opportunity to display it here, especially in tandem with Miss Liu. Again, this is not the most comprehensible kung fu movie but it's got plenty of good scenes and offers a satisfying mix of fighting and effects.",1057276800,3,1954,4.784023668639053
