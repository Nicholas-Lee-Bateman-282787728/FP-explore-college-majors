2772236,5,B000NNDCS6,"I love Full Moon movies and when I was researching the titles in this collection, Arcade sounded like a fun movie so I decided to buy it based on that. I wasn't disappointed. This collection contains 5 Full Moon movies.

Arcade (1993) starring Megan Ward, Peter Billingsley, Seth Green, and A.J. Langer is worth watching for the actors alone. The movie itself has horrible special effects, that I loved! The acting is good and the story is a lot of fun. Basically, it is about a group of teenagers that start playing a new video game called ARCADE. None of them realize how dangerous the game is until the people who are playing it starts to disappear.

Bad Channels (1992) starring Paul Hipp, Martha Quinn, and Charlie Spradling, ended up being one of my favorite movies from the collection. I saw the trailer and thought the movie was going to be horrible, I was wrong. The acting is good and so are the special effects and creatures. The movie is about a disc jockey who after a six month suspension returns. That night his radio station is taken over by a space alien that transports and shrinks women. I found it really amusing.

Netherworld (1992): A young man inherits his late father's estate and is shocked to discover that his father wants to be resurrected. He meets a woman who seduces him and introduces him to black magic. I didn't love this movie. The problem with it is that it just doesn't flow well.

Seedpeople (1992): Starring Sam Hennings and Andrea Roth.  A man returns to his home town to research a meteorite that landed there. He soon discovers that the town people are acting strangely and realizes he and everyone else is in a lot of trouble. This movie is an average sci-fi movie. I didn't enjoy it as much as Arcade and Bad Channels,  it is just not as fun to watch.

Shadowzone (1990) Starring Louise Fletcher and David Beecroft: After a person dies during a sleep experiment conducted by a group of NASA researchers, Captain Hickock goes to investigate. What he discovers is horrifying. This sci-fi movie takes it self seriously. It's not bad. I liked the actors and the script was pretty good.

Overall, the collection is worth buying if you love Full Moon classics or low budget sci-fi/horror movies. All of the dvds except Shadowzone contains a videozone/behind the scene featurette. The dvds are region free so they should work on all dvd players.",1209513600,32,2382,4.6682577565632455

We'd wait all week for Friday night, when we could watch Full Moon Classics just like these.  Modern, big budget horror is nice, and we certainly own a glut of it, but Full Moon movies fits right in with the stuff we love the most from late 80s-90s horror.

If you like campy, sometimes cheesy, late 80s/early 90s horror, you won't be disappointed with this offering. At $20, you're getting each gem for $4.  How could you go wrong with that, right?

Now go grab some snacks and soda, turn the lights off and transport yourself back to 1990. Good times. Full Moon will help ya remember those good days.",1440460800,,707,4.366412213740458

8179282,4,B000NNDCS6,"I have a feeling that if you're looking at this particular item listing on Amazon, you're probably already mostly sold on it. Full Moon movies appeal to a pretty specific crowd. I ended up finding this DVD pack after watching (and being amazed by) Peter Manoogian's Arena and Eliminators. This got me looking for Seedpeople on DVD. I figured I'd be willing to spend around $10 for it, so to get it plus 4 other ridiculous Full Moon films for $4.60 a piece was an awesome deal. There are trailers for all 5 of these movies on YouTube, so if you're wondering whether these are for you, I'd check that out. These movies are pretty much all (in my opinion) masterpieces of 90s cheese. There are a some surprisingly stars sprinkled through these 5 films, like James Hong, Louise Fletcher, and John DeLancie. Also, just about all the films have the distinction of being ""Based On An Idea By Charles Band"". He's like the real life Garth Marenghi, only more talented and excellent. Also, almost all the films include a post-credits ""stinger"" scene. If you thought Marvel came up with that practice, then THINK AGAIN! Bad Channels has the distinction of having a stinger featuring Doll Man, so if you're a Tim Thomerson fan you'll definitely want to check it out.

Aside from the movies themselves, I figured I'd give some info about the packaging and presentation, since that's part of evaluating this product. This collection comes as a set of 5 full size DVD boxes inside a basic cardboard slipcase. Goofily enough, all 5 have identical cover and disc art, but have a cropped version of the poster for the film on the BACK of each box. I would have preferred individual artwork on each disc and a multi-disc DVD box, but that kind of thing costs more to produce. All discs except for Shadowzone include a ""Making Of"" documentary from Full Moon's ""VideoZone"" series. Yes, that's what they called it. Its as TOTALLY RADICAL and BODACIOUS as the title suggests! In terms of audio & video quality, these are about as good as you're gonna get from such low budget source material. Me and my friends call these kinds of movies ""too good for HD"", which I think is about right. All five films are presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio and with stereo surround in Dolby Digital AC3 format. If you're going to be encoding these for use in a media center, it may be good to know that all five films have video tracks in the standard 640 x 480 display resolution, but all contain a bit of black pixels and / or video noise along the margins, so you really have only about 640 x 466 of picture. All five discs are region free and unencrypted, making them as compatible as possible. The movies were produced specifically for the home video market, which is why they have the 4:3 framing. The video quality is definitely much higher than any previous VHS releases of these films, although you won't be mistaking these for a pristine Scream Factory remastered release.

Overall, I am happy with this release. These movies are classics of the genre, and the packaging & presentation fits with the general cheesiness of Full Moon perfectly. The picture & sound are not amazingly pristine, but they're about as good as you're going to get from these productions, and they look how Full Moon movies ""should"" look, in my opinion. The package is a great value for the money.",1423785600,2,3342,4.634064080944351

8179285,3,B000NNDCS6,"This is a five-disc set. I'll be adding to my review and modifying my rating as I view more of the discs.

Bad Channels:
Oh dear. I really had to stop watching this. Wasn't horror at all, just a bad parody of horror sci-fi. If you like it goofy, you may enjoy it. It was a charming performance, but not at all what I was looking for, and I turned it off halfway through.

Netherworld:
 Much more like it. A voodoo story set right on the Bayou. All sorts of neat bird symbolism, some really pretty girls, a good story, and more tafia than I've ever seen before. Really nice movie, even good special effects! The one thing that ruined it for me (spoiler alert!!!): when we finally see the father's spirit, the makeup just doesn't work.

Arcade:
a) Since my birth, such strides have been made in cancer medicine that it can be said to have improved in every aspect beyond my wildest childhood dreams.
b) Since my birth, such strides have been made in the cause of world peace that it can be said to have improved in ever aspect beyond my wildest childhood dreams.
c) Since my birth, such strides have been made in computer graphics that it can be said to have improved in every aspect beyond my wildest childhood dreams.
Only one of the above statements is true. Can you guess which?
If Arcade had been Medicine Man or Apocalypse Now it might have had a shot at aging well. As it is...oh boy. The little actors here give it their hearts, and they are allowed to swear and get blood splattered on them, but it feels like a movie for kids that never existed. I don't think there was ever anybody who would have been impressed by the effects in this one, not even in the Middle Ages.
Look for Seth Green in a marginal role. Actually don't look. He's not worth it.",1403395200,,1757,4.331306990881459
8179286,5,B000NNDCS6,More Full Moon movies...Charles Band is a master at B horror flicks. Like I have said before Charles Band hes the man!!!,1396051200,,120,4.5
8179287,5,B000NNDCS6,"He's the man of Horror that brought you the cult movie Puppet Master, a thrilling outr&eacute; world of suspenseful films filled with horror and fantasy. Now he brings you five Full Moon Classics in a box set as Vol. 1.

""I remember when I first had seen his film Puppet Master, I loved it from the start!""

From the acclaimed ""should be awarded more"" winning Filmmaker, Charles Robert Band, owner of Full Moon Films and Charles Band Productions as well as his Brother pumped out hundreds such greats as Mansion of the Doomed, Laserblast, The Day Time Ended (which happens to be one of my favorites), Blood Dolls, Re-Animator, Parasite, Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn, Trancers, Subspecies, Shrieker, and alas, the famous Puppet Master and many many more, they were all picked from the top of my head and it helps to lean over and see them on my movie cabinet .

He won a George Pal Memorial Award in 86 and was nominated for International best film in 91. Of course that means he is awesome at Filmmaking and another reason why you should scour the cyber shelves for his films before I get to them. Oh yeah I know his films well let's just say I'm a fan. I also love the puppet animatronics and stop motion animation he employs in his films, another reason why I enjoy watching his works. Brings me back to the days of watching Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen films. Ah... the good ol'days.",1376006400,,1404,4.585657370517929
