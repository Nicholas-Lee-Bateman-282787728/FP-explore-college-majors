7616314,5,B01AZDMOGO,"Azumanga Daioh is easily one of my favorite anime series of all time, I'll spare you the details since most of you already know what you're getting into and just talk about the Sentai release of this show.

As someone who never got the chance to own the original DVD sets, I have to say this one isn't half bad. Sure, it would have been nice to get a bigger box or a slipcase, but it's a great release none the less.

Now, about the problems some people have with the audio/subtitles: I'm not defending Sentai here, but if you've seen any of their previous releases you would already know the only options you have are to watch the English dub (with no subtitles) or the original Japanese voices with subtitles. To my knowledge, every single one of their DVDs/Blu-rays only come with these two options and yes, it sucks. Personally I really don't mind since I always watch english dubs w/o subtitles and japanese voices with english subtitles, but if you really want to see the english voices with subtitles or the original japanese voices without subtitles you can always watch it on your PC with the program MPC-HC, which is completely free to download and can let you choose whichever style you feel like watching any show. I tested it with this DVD set and you can choose whichever style of viewing you prefer.

So I hope this clears up some of the problems some people seem to be having with this release and I hope that Sentai listens, because I too hate the fact they only let you watch their shows in that format. Also, take notes from FUNimation who most of the time release their Blu-ray sets with the DVDs included, have TONS of more extras (this DVD set of Azumanga Daioh doesn't include The Very Short Movie Special nor the ONA Azumanga Web Daioh), sometimes with very nice slipcases AND you can chose whichever style of viewing you prefer as well. C'mon Sentai, get it together.",1463529600,2,1892,4.542521994134898
7616315,5,B01AZDMOGO,"Exactly what I hoped for. Decent video quality, the sound is good. I Was skeptical about buying this because of how cheap it was. I Had bought a few collections on the cheap before from different companies and they either suffer from poor video quality or audio quality. If Sentai Selections other Collections are anything like this, I will definitely be a repeat customer. Amazing, and on a side note, my wife used to hate Anime till I showed her Azumanga Daioh. This is now her favorite anime and one of her all time favorite shows.",1463011200,3,534,4.572916666666667
7616316,5,B01AZDMOGO,"It's really...Well, weird how you can't simply select subtitles and audio options from any standard Blu-ray/DVD-player/PS3's menu.

I guess that requires a little clarification, because this is an odd case. In virtually everything ever, you can select Audio and Subtitle options on the fly, just from the player's menu. But that's not the case here. For reasons I don't really understand (because the video itself doesn't change, which would be the only justification I can think of), you can't do that here. You have to manually select either English 5.1 or Japanese 2.0 w/ subtitles from the options menu on the DVD menu itself. Then you can go back to the main menu, and select where you want to begin.

Normally this wouldn't really be a big deal, because you're going to stay on one or the other. But Azumanga Daioh has the same problem Lucky Star always had: Some of the jokes, particularly Japanese puns and intentionally bad jokes done in English (i.e., I and most viewers' primary language), just are impossible to translate well.

What that means is that you'll sometimes *know* when this is the case, and want to swap over to the original audio with subtitles to see what changed, maybe get the original joke a little better. But, as I mentioned, you can't do that smoothly, and you're required to go to the beginning and find your place again if you wanna do that. It's really sort of irritating, considering that the original release (which I admittedly lost in a relocation, hence my purchase of this) totally let you do that.

Of course, Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, has never let us rate the content separately from the release (note that this is absolutely stupid), so while it's still Azumanga Daioh and hence a pretty easy five stars, the release itself is questionable. Then again, the original release is a little hard to come by and priced far higher, so I guess you don't have much choice in the matter. That being considered, this is still...good, but not great, for the aforementioned reasons.

It's not all a downgrade, though. Some added on-screen text translations were added that would be expected nowadays, and some are even necessary to get it (Osaka's ""Hanshin"" geography-based plush animals come to mind as something that just need a subtitle for non-Japanese viewers to get, and that's added for clarification). The video and audio are totally fine, with not too many artifacts here and there and no noticeably distorted audio a la the unspeakable tragedy of the Chobits re-release.

*Mostly* everything's cool. Meaning everything's still Azumanga Daioh. But it still leaves you wanting to leave the ""mostly"" part out and just say it's all wonderful for a re-release.

When all is said and done, though, despite the downright bizarre audio and subtitle options that inexplicably aren't built-in to the DVD itself as options (I realize that's confusing, but I think I explained it okay, as did other reviewers), it's still Azumanga Daioh, and that's a good thing. Lucky Star might be its quaalude-intoxicated follow-up that definitely had its own charm, but Azumanga just can't really be topped. It never has been. It's had its derivatives, but nothing in the way of a direct competition for this animation.

Besides, let's face it. This is the only place you can get Osaka animated. Osaka's both adorable and terrifying, and the latter somehow enhances the former in her case.",1462752000,16,3413,4.923478260869565
7616317,5,B01AZDMOGO,"This review is for the content of the show itself. We are lucky to see a rerelease for this show, especially since it is an older show. This release isn't perfect, but if story and good subbing matters to you, you'll be satisfied.
I won't give away too much for those who haven't seen the show, because you're in for a fun time! Since the show is based off a four panel comedy manga, it doesn't follow a clear cut plot. Each episode has its own story to enjoy.
The characters that you are indroduced to in the show are each unique and loveable in their own way. Despite the show's silly antics, there is a sense of realism to this show. All of the characters actually look Japanese, there is no whitewashing in this show whatsoever with blonde haired characters and unnatural eye colors. The characters look like real people, which makes them easy to identify with.
This anime would be a great starting point for a younger fan in their teens looking for an appropriate anime. Sure, some of the jokes are risqu in nature, but overall this anime is pretty tame. It's actually got some great moments that show life as it is: completely random and unpredictable.
This anime has a positive vibe and is easy to digest. It isn't too complicated, but sometimes we just need simple in our lives. You're sure to smile while watching Azumanga Daioh.",1462665600,,1338,4.533057851239669
7616318,3,B01AZDMOGO,"Azumanga Daioh continues to hold a special place in my experience as an anime fan. To summarize, it's the character-driven story of 6 girls during their high school years.
Its characters still stand out in my memory, such as:
Miss Yukari is a high school teacher who has the emotional maturity of a typical high school student who's grounded by her former classmate and fellow teacher Miss Kurosawa;
Chiyo, the elementary-school-age wunderkind whose intelligence got her into high school;
the bespectacled Yomi isn't stereotypically shy and nerdy, but rather, she's the one who has to keep her hyperactive friend Tomo in check; Sakaki is intelligent, athletic and beautiful, but all she wants is for the local cats to love her;
Kagura, the super-competitive tomboy athlete;
and Osaka is--well, she's Osaka.
AD's art style is cute and the music soundtrack is minimalist but sets the show's light tone with great success and portions of the soundtrack can easily get stuck in your head. The characters are funny and believable, which is bolstered by some of the finest voice acting and directing that I can recall. The fanservice is also minimal and doesn't subtract from the character development. Best of all, a lot of its jokes survived the translation from Japanese to English!
Also, this is still the only comedy anime whose ending got me, a grown man, misty-eyed.

With that out of the way, let's talk about the Sentai Filmworks re-release.
I've been waiting for the re-release of Azumanga Daioh since ADV went under and my expectations were high. Now that I've examined the discs' content, I've been left with mixed feelings. I pre-ordered and received the re-release, my biggest complaint is that the DVD box set is sorely lacking in subtitle and language options. On ADV's DVD set, they let the viewer have the option to watch the English dub with English translations of the on-screen Kanji! Not only that, but ADV also allowed viewers to mix and match language options while watching the show! The re-release from Sentai Filmworks only gives viewers 2(!) language options: Japanese with English subtitles, and the English dub without any subtitles! And these can only be chosen via the Main Menu!

I wish that this edition of Azumanga Daioh was worthy of a 5 Star rating, but it's not.
Until the issues with the subtitle and language options are addressed, I can only give it 3 Stars.
However, if they do get fixed in another re-issue, I will purchase that and revise my review accordingly. Without hesitation.",1462406400,14,2519,4.952718676122932
7616319,4,B01AZDMOGO,"I've watched this entire show online and it is both cute and funny. I wouldn't recommend this be watched by young boys without parental involvement because a lot of the issues discussed are real-life girl & women issues. Also, the show tends to mainly portray males as perverts. I would highly recommend this to anyone else, though. :)",1460764800,,335,4.793103448275862
7616320,5,B01AZDMOGO,"While this may not be for everyone, Azumanga Daioh is a series essential to anime.  Its quiet, introspective look at high school girl life is endearing, adorable, and fun.  It's not very action driven, and has basically no romance or violence, so it's able to be a character study in the way that no other anime, and indeed movie in general, ever is.  For that uniqueness alone, it's worth a watch.  Not to mention that this is only 26 episodes, making every episode a well-paced, entertaining ride, rather than 100 episodes with about 50 episodes' worth of plot, as it is with some anime.

The manga is good too, so be sure to check out both.",1500508800,,643,4.508620689655173
