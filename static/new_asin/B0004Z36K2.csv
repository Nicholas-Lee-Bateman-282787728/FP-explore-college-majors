Also, the kids don't really move in most of the songs only sway back and forth.  I had bought this DVD to play during Sunday School but have used another one so far as the kids in the DVD are actually doing something.  My last con is that the singing isn't that great - it's fine but not really good.

On the up side, it covers most of the traditional Sunday School songs and is good to have around!",1414368000,,565,4.146788990825688
