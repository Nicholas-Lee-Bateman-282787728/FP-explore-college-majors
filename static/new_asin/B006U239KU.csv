5018648,5,B006U239KU,"I just recently seen this. If you're into the Miyazaki movies such as ""Sprited Away"", then this movie will be up your alley. The animation is great, the Japanese are great, and the story is amazing (my opinion anyways).

 The story centers on Asuna, a girl who spends her solitary days listening to the mysterious music emanating from the crystal radio she received from her father as a memento. However, she embarks on a journey of adventure to meet a boy again, and thus comes to know the cruelty and beauty of the world, as well as loss.

5018649,5,B006U239KU,"If you like movies, you'll like this movie, but if you don't like movies, you won't like this movie. CAUSE IT'S GOOD",1348444800,5,116,4.318181818181818
5018650,5,B006U239KU,"First, I want to comment on the dvd itself.  This dvd was from Malaysia.  Before I ordered, I was concerned about that quality and that it might be a bootleg.  I'm still not 100% sure, but it played without problems on my region 1 player.  The video, audio and english subtitles were all perfect.  So all-in-all I'm satisfied with the product.

Now onto the movie itself.  I purchased this simply due to the fact it is a Makoto Shinkai film.  I'm a big fan of his work.  I wasn't disappointed.  The animation is beautiful and vibrant as expected.  This story is more of a ""fantasy"" film than some of his others.  Without going into detail, it's basically about a girl who embarks on a mysterious journey with many weird, scary, dangerous, touching, happy sad events happening along the way.  It's an interesting journey.  Something along the lines of a Miyazaki film ala Spirited Away.  Will the girl survive the perilous journey and make it home safely?  Better find out for yourself.",1335139200,25,985,4.6725146198830405
5018681,3,B006U239KU,"Meh. If you are a Ghibli fan, this has the strangeness of Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle but it just didn't hit the mark for me. My biggest gripe was the voice over. The voice of main character is unbearable. Instead of selecting a younger actress it sounds like they selected a mature actress who in a very over the top fashion tried to sound like a young girl. 2 hours of listening to that squeaky, desperate squeal of a voice is pretty rough. Graphics were great. Storyline just ok. Rent, don't buy.",1489795200,,509,4.425531914893617

5018683,4,B006U239KU,"A truly stunning fantasy film. Beautiful Animation (In the Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli style) that straddles the modern, real world with a timeless fantasy land of tantalizing wonders and frightening dangers....that does not shy away from real feelings of loss and grief.

5018685,4,B006U239KU,"Cute little movie that is honestly so beautiful.

The story starts unrealistically cliched but the artwork and animation makes up for it. The characters are ok, their motivations are ok, it's an average story. But it's so pretty.",1484611200,,229,5.026315789473684
5018686,5,B006U239KU,I know nothing about this movie or the storyline. But my teen was brought to tears and can't stop saying how beautiful it is. It's been 3 days. Seriously she keeps saying it was sooooo beautiful.,1478649600,,195,4.444444444444445
5018687,5,B006U239KU,"I saw the first installment or disk of this movie on Adult Swim and was so moved by the animation and story line that I had to purchase the set.  The opening scene of this movie is so realistic looking, the cherry blossom tree at the beginning to the animal with the wind blowing through it's fur.  And the night sky, oh my goodness, absolutely breath taking.  The music in this movie nearly brings me to tears it's so beautiful, I'm looking for the music CD.

Of all the animation I have seen and purchased over the years I must say Japanese anime is by far my favorite.  The way they combine fantasy with reality in many of their stories is amazing and sometimes leaves me in tears.

If you are a lover of anime you won't be sorry with the purchase.",1478476800,,751,4.253521126760563

5018689,3,B006U239KU,"Thought this was going to be like Hinkai's other works... and in one aspect it was. The animation for this movie is amazing. I mean utterly stunning.
The story, however, felt like a mishmash of Ghibli characters and world building concepts underutilized and badly put together. It had no pacing, the character development was laughable, and what's in an ending? Won't spoil it, but I recommend streaming this movie legally before purchasing. Don't make the mistake I did and buy before watching... actually this is the only purchase I've ever regretted.
Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all.
Avoid making my mistake: I mistook the stars reflected in a pond at night for those in the heavens. Thinking I'd found more gold amongst the pile when in fact it was fool's gold.",1471046400,,771,4.848484848484849
5018690,5,B006U239KU,"As good as one of the great Ghibli movies, I truly enjoyed this film, and so did my spouse. We laughed, cried, got angry, felt nervous, this movie is a rollercoaster of emotion. The plot is great, the character development done well, and the themes are integrated in such a way that the movie imparts them on the viewer in a tasteful manner. This was my first non Ghibli anime movie, and I am thoroughly impressed.",1468800000,,414,4.4605263157894735

5018703,3,B006U239KU,"Honestly this was a let down. I absolutely love all his other movies but this failed in my opinion. It had potential to be something special but the actual plot just didn't measure up to what it could and should have been. About 70 percent into the movie I found myself thinking ""geez is this almost over yet?"" Which is never a good thing. Once they reached there goal it didn't feel very climatic or anything just like ""oh.."" and that was it. Not gonna go into spoilers but there's alot to criticize with that moment. The animation of course is beautiful and has a very interesting synopsis but it just fell flat. Definitely not worth 22 dollars. He tried to do something different then what all of his other movies have done and it had a great setup and world to be explored yet just left me dissapointed.",1466035200,,807,4.422818791946309

5018736,5,B006U239KU,"My sister randomly found this movie and made me watch it with her--I've seen it over three times within the last couple of weeks, and honestly, it's so gooood!! I really LOVE the characters and the sweet/sad feel of the whole movie. The whole concept was really clear to me as I watched it and it really made an impression on me. This movie stands on it's own for me, and I love how out of the blue it feels, I really don't know what to compare this movie to because it doesn't remind me of anything else I've seen.
The pacing of the movie is strange, but I really don't mind it. I describe it as  ""the fastest slow movie I've ever seen"". There are so many random things that happen in this movie! And I loved it!
I really love this movie and all that it offers!",1443484800,3,762,4.114093959731544
5018737,2,B006U239KU,"The accolades abound for this film, but unfortunately, I found it above all things boring.  It seems to have borrowed the sappy, melodramatic, pseudo-heartwarming scores Studio Ghibli seem to always use in their films, which have never fit better than in this schmaltzy, uninteresting greeting card poem of a film.  I gave it plenty of time, but despite a few hints at excitement, it never went anywhere interesting.  The synopsis sounds intriguing, but the over-romanticized emotional baggage of the story more than canceled out any suspense or conflict.
I was also uncomfortable with the implied love interest between the teenage boy and the pre-teen protagonist, a scenario that seems to show up often in these type of films.  The more I notice it, the more I have to wonder what's behind this tendency to write female child characters falling in love with post-adolescent boys.  Perhaps it's a cultural thing I don't get as an American, but I can't help being a little creeped out by it.
The big anime studios do a great job of building beautiful films, but in the past several years, they've moved more and more in the direction of maudlin stories in which emotional gushing predominates the plot.  Miyazaki's last three or four films, for instance, were completely unremarkable.  This one feels like a Miyazaki film, but like Arriety and Ponyo, it disappointed me.  I don't care how pretty a film is; it needs to keep me interested, and this one utterly failed to do that.",1441411200,,1478,4.884

5018739,4,B006U239KU,"It's a beautifully produced anime. I loved the graphic art, the music and the directing. However, there is not much in the plot though. Don't expect an intense action type of movie or sad love story. It's pretty calm and stays there the whole show.

She hopes she is hearing her father from the other side and to a certain degree she is hearing from beyond.  Thru a series of events, she does make it to this other world but finds it very different than what she thought.

5018775,2,B006U239KU,"This movie was quite the disappointment.  Having watched and loved Wolf Children and Summer Wars, I was expecting wonderful things from this film that was recommended to me shortly after.  The premise was intriguing, the art style appealing, but the follow through, the story, and characters were all strange, not quite believable, which took a lot from your investment in them as a girl and a man who is most certainly her enemy travel through a fantastical land, in which the girl's savior is a boy who looks like another boy that appears in the beginning of the movie, but isn't (and is bitter about it?).  There was a lot of promise in this film, but I feel like how they chose to tell the story was off to one degree or another, and I would not recommend purchasing it unless you have already watched and enjoyed this film.",1429056000,,828,4.543624161073826

5018779,5,B006U239KU,It was a wonderful move very interesting. The artwork was beautiful and the story well thought out. It flowed nicely and you really did grow close and interested in the characters. The start reminded me of my childhood and yet grew into quite the adventure that I wanted to see how it ends. It has its funny parts but it has its sad parts as well. The ending they could have continued but I think where they stopped it was just at the right place. It wrapped everything up yet left you wondering about certain things. I personally liked and will enjoy watching it again and again.,1427414400,3,580,4.429906542056075

If I could describe this movie, it feels like a mix between Spirited Away and the Bridge to Taribithia.
The visuals are beautiful for an animation.
The story almost seems like a two parter- (*spoiler*) with the loss of a friend in the beginning, and fantastical adventures from the middle to end.
The characters are engaging and interesting with great arcs. The story may be a little condensed but the overall feel leaves me with wonder.

For me personally it falls short when compared with the movies of Hayao Miyazaki, which combine artistic brilliance combined with real life stories and deeper insights into humanity than found in Hollywood animated films.

The story is very complex, colorful, and very moving in parts, but some of the plot doesn't come off as cohesive at times as some of Makoto Shinkai's other works. Still, the animation is moving, the settings are wonderfully thought out and full of detail. I've read that this is Shinkai's homage to Miyazaki, and it definitely shows, but not in a way that makes it seem like a carbon copy. Shinkai's style is still there.

Note to those who want to watch this with kids: there are scenes that may definitely upset children if they're not prepared. My niece was fine with it, but your mileage may vary. It's definitely worth a watch if you want to expand your repertoire of Japanese animated movies beyond Miyazaki, but if you're watching with children under ten, enjoy it yourself first, then decide whether or not you want to share with little ones.",1403740800,3,1046,4.529100529100529

Is that cost worth it? In the end, what's really important? These are some serious and poignant spiritual concepts. They're well put together in this, sometimes sad, but beautifully animated movie. Those who have ears will hear. Those who don't won't receive the blessing. In an offhand way you could compare it to Miyazaki, but you can compare a lot of anime with Miyazaki, and Miyazaki with a lot of anime. Sure didn't seem all that much like Miyazaki to me, but my tears may have blurred my vision.",1403740800,,676,4.459677419354839

5018856,1,B006U239KU,"I've never seen a film try so hard to mimic someone else's style, but fail so hard to understand why that director's films worked in the first place.  Scene after scene lifts seemingly random elements out of Miyazaki films, from the fox squirrel to that thing where the female lead's hair raises up a little when she's shocked, to the way the fur on this one monster moves exactly like Totoro's, but these are applied seemingly at random over an incompetently told story.  It's not even clear whether the beginning parts are supposed to be in the real world or not.  It starts off with the personality-less heroine hanging out with a fox squirrel and using a weird piece of technology, but then everything else seems to be part of the real world until a monster attack comes out of nowhere.  She then gets saved by some guy from a fantasy world who you never learn anything about, and from there it's mostly a meandering, poorly paced trek through a generic fantasy world to accomplish ill defined goals.  All of this to the music swelling up dramatically at completely inconsequential events, almost to the point where it feels like it was supposed to be a parody.

The biggest problem comes from the characters.  Only one of them has any personality or drive to do anything.  The heroine has no agency whatsoever.  She's literally dragged by the hand into the other world (hilariously while the guy dragging her goes on about how she has to make a choice here) and just follows along with everyone without showing any desire to accomplish anything there, explore, or try to leave.  The one time she shows an emotion, it's her crying about being lonely, which really doesn't work when the only times you saw her interact with peers were her being invited to hang out (and turning it down for some reason), falling in love with her generic savior guy, and going on a grand adventure with some others.  She's basically the exact opposite of any female character in any Miyazaki film.

I do however have to say that the movie is quite pretty, and if you see a clip or two online, you'll probably be pretty tempted to watch.  Sadly, this is one of those rare movies where context completely ruins the scenes, since you'll find that they have no weight, little connection to each other, and are about characters with less depth than cardboard.

In short, this film is a boring, incoherent mess, and I have no idea how it has any following at all.",1395273600,9,2442,4.609699769053118

5018858,5,B006U239KU,"This is an excellent, action-driven animated movie by the very promising, young, and artistically ambitious anime director Shinkai.
Unlike his previous work, this is a much bigger production and his longest-running film, so far. The DVD transcription is very good, with excellent Japanese and English sound tracks. There is also, in the two-disk version, an interesting and informative documentary on the making of this movie that explains in some detail how a major animation project like this is carried out.
It is a significant departure from his previous work, which has been mostly about the misadventures and agonies of star-crossed (and very young) lovers. For this high-adventure one, while keeping some of his distinctive choice of color palette and drawing style, he has borrowed much of the look and feel, and tempo (particularly the feeling of the passage of time during the day and with the seasons), of the best movies from Studio Ghibli, and even taken some ideas and sequences from ""Castle in the Sky"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", adapting them to fit within his story.
By the way, if you like this movie, but have not seen yet those two, you most likely will enjoy watching them as well. Shinkai is reported to have been inspired by them to try to make a career in animation.
The main story is a retelling of the ancient Greek and Roman myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (and similar ones in various cultures): a hero (and, here, also a heroine) trying to retrieve a dead love from the underworld and bring her (or, in this case, also him) back to the land of the living. As in that story, the search proves ultimately futile. But in Shinkai's version, what really matters is the journey and not the destination.
This is an epic-quest fantasy story with some scary passages (that remind me of some dark ones in Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings""). So it is probably not a good one for young children.
I wholeheartedly recommend it for everyone else, and look forward to seeing more of the future work of Makoto Shinkai.",1390953600,4,2022,4.796561604584527

5018861,3,B006U239KU,"And to be fair, that's what Shinkai said he was going for with this.  But IMO it doesn't suit his strengths as a director, and it's not what I came to expect of him after seeing his wonderful film ""5 Centimeters per Second"", which IMO is second to none when it comes to Anime films.  I'm not going to get in depth about the criteria here, but just say that this film just didn't do it for me.  I found myself losing interest quickly.  It didn't hold my attention.  I just didn't care for it very much.

And while many hail the change in animation this film displayed, to a more Ghibli/universally accepted style... I personally preferred his old style.  5 cm per second was probably the most visually attractive Anime I've ever seen.  The background art was amazing.  To make an analogy, it felt like a quality, hand made product whereas this film would be machine made and mass produced off an assembly line.  This film, and the animation style seems to me an attempt to conform by Shinkai and be just like everyone else... but I don't want him to be.  His own style and individuality is what made him so great to begin with, and what made 5 cm so amazing.  It's what drew the comparisons to Miyazaki... his brilliance.  He shouldn't take the comparison in a literal sense and make his films/animations like his.  I could've sworn when I saw Shin that I was seeing the protagonist from Princess Mononoke...  I hope he hasn't lost sight of what earned him that comparison, and that this was just a hiccup and not the direction he's going to go in now.  IMHO 5 cm was even better than anything Ghibli has ever put out.  He shouldn't be trying to be the next Miyazaki.  He should aspire to be the first Makoto Shinkai.",1388361600,,1716,4.410828025477707

Children Who Chase Lost Voices has 3 main characters (at first it has 4). The 3 main characters got involved in a mission to bring back someone back to life.

5018879,5,B006U239KU,"""Children Who Chase Lost Voices From Deep Below"" is filmmaker Makoto Shinkai's tribute to the great Hayao Miyazaki. Anyone who knows Studio Ghibli films will recognize the many similar images Shinkai uses throughout the film to put the viewer in mind of those wonderful movies.

One example is the way the main character, Asuna, lowers her foot hesitantly onto the first step on a huge rock cliff; the movement of her foot is almost precisely the same as Chihiro's in Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" when she is descending the huge staircase to the boiler room. Another is when Asuna awakes and looks up at the sky above her, and her cat comes up on her shoulder and she reaches up to pet it in exactly the same way as Nausicaa reaches to pet Teto, her foxsquirrel, in ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind."" Viewers can hardly miss the moment when one of the heroes of ""Lost Voices"" reaches back with a knife to cut his hair and then proceeds to ride off with his sister looking worriedly on. If they are anything like me, in fact, they will cry in outrage, ""But that's EXACTLY the same as Ashitaka does it in `Princess Mononoke'! He copied!"" But I was mistaken. Upon further research, I discovered Makoto Shinkai intended all of these moments (and more that I have not listed) to be tributes to the beloved films of Miyazaki. Now that I know, I find it very fun to pick out these moments when I watch the movie.

However, these brief images that catch your eye and suspicion are almost the sole things that are ""borrowed"" from Miyazaki films; it is a lovely, stand-alone movie that, if you can get past the initial surprise at encountering so many references to Studio Ghibli, is well-worth watching and not merely a weaker imitation of Miyazaki's work. True, the movie's epic fantasy plot and struggle with the issue of death could also be echoes of Ghibli, as perhaps the director intended, but the issue of death is a common theme in anime, and Shinkai's take on it is just as fresh and beautiful as that of most Miyazaki films. The characters themselves are Shinkai's own and so is most of the story. Asuna is not much like Chihiro, Nausicaa, San, ect., but a fully original character who must understand and recognize her own pain and longings before she can move on to face them. I also appreciated the characterization of 12-year-old Shin, who, though he does cut his hair and ride out of his village, is not even remotely like Ashitaka or any other Studio Ghibli hero, and proves himself to be a very realistic character. He is often moody and snaps at people for seemingly no reason, which seems to me to be the most realistic thing about him: people do not always act as rationally or sensibly as they often do in movies.

In short, it's a touching story about letting go and moving on, and the animation is quite stunning. 5 stars for Makoto Shinkai's excellent film, none the less for being a tribute to someone else's work.",1382313600,3,2931,4.568441064638783

5018993,3,B006U239KU,"""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" is a 2011 Japanese animated film directed by Makoto Shinkai, (5 Centimeters per Second).  Briefly, it's a fantasy story about a parallel afterlife world within this earth and follows an exploration of that setting.  Tack on a dab of young romance with some small bursts of manicured violence and there's your anime.  It just didn't leave me fully satisfied.

Firstly, my wife and I watched it this evening and she remarked immediately how similar the film looked to Hiyao Miyazaki's works.  Not that this is a reason to bash Shinkai's efforts - I can think of much worse directors to be compared to - but I saw the similarities as well and found it a bit of a distraction.  (Especially after I'd previously defended Shinkai against the critics who panned him for mimicking Miyazaki in the past.)  We'd both seen, ""5 Centimeters per Second"" last year and were exhilarated with its nearly perfect production.  The animation was absolutely incredible and we'd hoped it the future of anime, so our scanning of upcoming titles from Makoto Shinkai was fervent.  Thus, while this current work is clearly well done, it still, in my amateur opinion, was a bit of a letdown.  We were looking forward to something new and, aside from some interesting, ""creature"" developments, that didn't happen.

Moving along, however, I think it's important to air some accolades, here.  The characters are successfully written and easily adhered to.  The main protagonist, Asuna, is a girl in what I'd guess to be her low teens living a quiet life in a small mountain town.  Her father is deceased and her mother is a hard-working woman toiling for two.  I thought Asuna in particular was beautifully drafted, a skill I also found notable in, ""5 Centimeters..."": Shinkai has youth on tap and offers it up flawlessly.  This, to me, is his remarkable gift.  He brings nostalgia to his films and this will keep me loyal to whatever he creates.  And that's big.

Also, the environments are stunning.  I've obviously alluded to them not standing up to the originality of his previous work, but he's still done a painstakingly wonderful job with this and deserves praise.  Once the film crosses over to its underground setting, it wows.  Flat out.

But when the film ended, it didn't feel whole to me.  It took me on a lengthy ride through some stunning scenery but the story only fizzled at its peaks so I walked away hungry.  Again, this isn't meant to detract from the amount of work and skill used to make this movie happen - it's gorgeous and well though out - but I just can't see myself ever watching it again.  Replay value, for me, is paramount, and this just felt like another fantasy quest in the anime armada, albeit one of the upper shelf.

So, I can't fully recommend, ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" but I won't berate it, either.  Even though I don't love what Shinkai's done here, I still recognize that he's a force to be reckoned with in this genre and I will continue to follow his career until he hits the sort of home run that interests me.  And I know it's coming, I just have to wait...

Thank you for your time.

Things went pretty well through much of the video, but it fell apart really bad in the ending.  There really was no ending -  it only stopped.  Nothing was resolved.  It's as if time simply stopped, then resumed sometime later and all but one of the story's characters were simply gone and forgotten.  No explanation.  No reasons.  No resolution.  It just ended without an ending.

Many of the characters (i.e. the drawn figures) seem to have appeared in other movies previously; however, that didn't bother me.  It was as if the cast was made up of actors that had started in other movies.  I'm OK with that because it was still well done.

It is not that I didn't like it.  It is a good movie and I enjoyed it; however, the collapse of the story at the end was highly disappointing and anti-climatic.  It didn't totally spoil the movie, but it surely didn't leave one with a feeling that the story was completed.  Just too many loose ends left dangling.

5018996,4,B006U239KU,"If someone were to imagine ""Lord of the Rings"" combined with ""What Dreams May Come"" in anime format, then Children Who Chase Lost Voices would be the result. Here's an adventure deeply rooted in ancient mythology with modern struggles of life and death. The tagline for the film is roughly translated as ""A Journey to learn to say goodbye"".

Visually, this film is stunning(!) as the writer/director Makoto Shinkai displays a talent for bold and beautiful color palettes reminiscent of masters such as Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli. However, his ability to include lighting effects from the sun and stars is deeply unique and captures the attention in any scene. This is a film done so artistically well that, regardless of plot, it's simply fun to watch for the continuous juxtaposition between light and darkness (life and death).

Shinkai is rightfully compared with Hayao Miyazaki, and for good reason. This is creative and compelling storytelling, even if a little imperfect, and if this is what Shinkai can do as a relatively new director then his work is worth following in the future.",1364601600,,1094,5.0054945054945055

5019023,2,B006U239KU,"If this was for a different director this could be a 4 star piece. If this was from Hiyao Miyazaki I would say he was finally recovering from his slump after having phoned in Ponyo and Arrietty,which have left us wondering if his days of greatness are done.
Unfortunately it is a big let down from the director who created what is one of the greatest anime works, Voices of a Distant Star. This is Makoto Shinkai trying to do Hiyao Miyazaki, it is done well enough that if people told me it was a Miyazaki film I would have said ""not bad!"". But the problem it that with the loss of Satoshi Kon and Hiyao Miyazaki appearing to have run out of ideas there are few great directors on the scene right now. Who knows when Otomo will release again. Hiyao Miyazaki's son has done the utterly abysmal Earthsea. Rintaro is done.
So the let down is for the future of anime and seeing a director with so much potential, put out what feels like another man's work.

While this film is a much closer fit to Hiyao Miyazaki than Origin: Spirits of the Past, it is still just another knock off. If you do not care about directors consider this a 4 star piece and enjoy it; as for the rest of us, we expect greatness from Makoto Shinkai and this was not it.",1361318400,4,1240,4.254237288135593

The GOOD:
-The art/animation is great. It has a Miyazaki feel to it.
-The Story was pretty and a nice idea. I've read/heard allot about mythology stories, and it was nice to see anime take up this idea and make it their own.

The BAD:
-The plot. It was pretty choppy in some places, and you left with a few questions at each main point. (Kind of like in ""Tales from Earth Sea"") I felt like the story could have definitely benefited from having a smother plot.
-Not really a kids film. It's fairly graphic (not graphic like a horror movie), but you see a lot of blood at some points and some detached body parts.",1360713600,3,783,4.213333333333333

The film is very strong visually.  As usual, the animation and backgrounds are amazingly detailed and evocative.  Music by Tenmon is excellent.  The BD boasts strong image quality and sound design. It makes excellent use of the rear channels.

However, this film has themes that are too reminiscent of the work of Hayao Miyazaki.  I could not help but be reminded of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke while watching parts of this film.  With ""Voices"" and ""5 Cm,"" Mr. Shinkai showed he does have a unique voice when it comes to the writing of his own anime.

Which brings me to Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below, a movie with a title almost as long as this review.

The film is beautifully illustrated, both the characters and the scenery, and the story has depth.  Furthermore, Shinkai has woven references from his own films, such as a bird in flight, or a young girl running down a light dappled lane, without just copying previous work.  He's paid homage to Studio Ghibli, both in story style and with characters that blend, in an original way, characters from Ghibli films such as Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away.  This film is striking.  There is another pattern here though, that is found in his other films.  While his characters have personality, they are characteristically understated, and they don't quite pop.  Shinkai's usual themes of melancholy and loss are not as heavily applied here as in his other work, but they would be more fully realized if his characters were too.",1355443200,,1665,4.6169491525423725
5019056,5,B006U239KU,"Makoto Shinkai, the former Falcom graphic designer, who took the anime industry by storm back in 2001 when he released his anime OVA titled ""Voices of a Distant Star"", which he created on his Power Mac G4 and using several software and voice acted by he and his wife Miko and music provided by his friend Tenmon.

The OVA inspired many for the fact it was independent, created on a small budget but looked significantly better than some major anime series by well-known animation studios.

Suffice to say, the person who grew up inspired by Miyazaki films was now given a chance to create more animated films and he would eventually achieve success with ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" (2004) and ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" (2007).

In 2011, Shinkai returned with the animated film ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices (""Hoshi o Ou Kodomo"") which he directed, wrote and produced.

And now the film was released in the U.S. on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" is presented in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen and English and Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 with English subtitles

It's important to note that if you want the best picture quality for this animated film and also the best audio, there is a Blu-ray release for this animated film that will be released on the same day of the DVD.

As far as the DVD is concern, the film has the trademark of a Makoto Shinkai film.  Beautiful, well-detailed clouds.  Characters that almost have a Studio Ghibli look and scenery that is lush and well-detailed with animation design that is shaded, colorful but art backgrounds that are just stunning to look at.

Personally, this is one film that would look amazing via HD on Blu-ray but for DVD, picture quality is very good.

As far as the soundtrack is concerned, the audio is very good. Not only do you hear the ambiance of bugs, outdoor environments such as Asuna running on the grass and the roar of the gatekeepers and izoku, the audio is well-done through the surround channels.  But no doubt, I can't help but think how much more impressive the soundtrack would be via lossless (Blu-ray).  But those who purchase the DVD should be pleased by the overall soundtrack. As for voice acting, both Japanese and English soundtracks are well acted.

As for subtitles, the subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

If experience is a factor of determining a person's ability to create amazing work, with only three major films under his belt, there are still some who claim that Makoto Shinkai has many years to go to prove he is the real deal.

After watching ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", I have to differ.  As filmmaker Jean Vigo had done in France, creating only three films in his career but yet his life was cut short of tuberculosis, cineaste yet consider Vigo as one of the great French filmmakers of all time.

Makoto Shinkai may have gotten into the industry through a different process than other veterans but there is no doubt that his talent is a rarity.  As Shinkai was influenced by the great Hayao Miyazaki, many who have watched Shinkai's work continually grow within the last decade, can't help but be amazed of his accomplishment with three films and the growth as a director, writer and producer.

Shinkai has been a rarity in which he works with the people that he wants to work with, he creates and writes anime the way he wants to do it and so far, many people all over the world have been overjoyed by his work because its not more about creating animated films for the sake of commercialism or the sake of getting something out there to make profit for a major studio.  He creates a film because of his passion for it.

Prior to watching ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", I have always felt that Shinkai's ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" is his true masterpiece.  A gorgeous animated film that was not only heartbreaking but also beautiful and touching.  It was a film about life and love that many people have experienced.  Love, heartbreak but people moving on.

With his latest film ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", you can apply the same idea of love, heartbreak and people moving on but in a context of alternate worlds and one wanting to bring back a deceased loved one.

The film looks absolutely gorgeous from its animation to its art backgrounds.  Each scene can be appreciated for its beauty and for anime fans, Shinkai's films are almost like a painting that you just loved to look at over and over again and sometimes after looking at it, you have a different interpretation.  This is not a film that is commercial or quickly made.  It was well-planned and perfectly executed.

The characters of ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" are all characters who have lost a loved one and no doubt has altered or changed their lives.  Asuna, losing her father and having to grow up in order to prove to her mother that she is old enough to take care of the house while her mother works.  But then seeing that side of her that wants that peace and serenity and take out this radio which reminds her of her father.  It's her time of remembrance but also her time of reflection.

The two other characters outside of the protagonist are quite different.  With Mr. Morisaki determined in bringing his wife back, part of us can't call him an antagonist because we know that a man who found love, lost his one true love, will do all he can to bring his love back to life if he can.  It's hard to dislike a man with those intentions, but at the same time, we know that his actions are against people who live in Agartha.

For Shin, he lost his brother, but he hasn't had the time to mourn.  If anything, he is conflicted of his goals to save the one girl that his brother saved, despite her being a ""top-dweller"".  But knows that by assisting her, he himself can be banished from Agartha.

While the film may seem complex with its concept of hidden worlds, Quetzalcoatls (gatekeepers) and people who are trying to protect their land from the top-dwellers, the storyline is easy to understand.

Like previous Shinkai films, people trying to seek resolve may be disappointed.  There are no easy answers to the storyline of Shinkai's films.  Like in reality, things happen and people must live life by adjusting to their new environments and the new people that they are with.

I'm sure the gate is still open for more stories that involve Asuna, Shin and Mr. Morisaki but similar to ""5 Centimeters Per Second"", I looked at the film as we experience life with the people we love and as we get older or years pass by, some lose those people they were once close with.  Fall outs of relationships or by unfortunate circumstances including death.  There is no going back to the past nor is there reviving the deceased, one must move forward.

As for the DVD release of ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", as mentioned, if you want the best in video and audio, the Blu-ray is the way to go.  But as for the DVD itself, the DVD looks good and fortunately the special features were put on a second DVD disc.

Overall, Makoto Shinkai once again has created a masterpiece and another film added to his oeuvre of magnificent animated films created within the last decade.  ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"" is a gorgeous, touching animated film worth watching, worth owning and is highly recommended!",1354233600,36,8342,4.717346233586731
5019057,5,B006U239KU,"As many critics and reviewers have undoubtedly noticed, this film bears much similarity to many Miyazaki films, most notably Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke.  The creator, Makoto Shinkai, is a self confessed Miyazaki fan and counts Castle in the Sky among his favorite animated films.  So is Shinkai the new Miyazaki?  If this film is any indication, then yes.  And not in a way that emulates the old master, but more in keeping with the tradition of the storytelling style of film.  I'll expand on this.

In 'Children' as I will call this film, we follow Asuna, a pretty average junior high age school girl in what appears to me to be the 1967 to 1973 time frame (judging by the Cobra helicopter which was built in 1967 and by the cars, hair and clothing indicative of the late 60s or early 70s).  Asuna has received a radio with an odd crystal as the receiver as a memento from her father.  This starts a series of events which leads to her meeting with Shun, a mysterious boy who appears to save Asuna from an Otherworld creature.

Asuna eventually discovers that Shun is from a type of 'Middle-Earth' realm known as Agartha.  Her teacher, Morisaki, also describes the place as Shambhala.  Research into the myth of Agartha shows that it was coined by a French occultist in the early 20th century.  There is also belief by the Theosophical society that Shambhala was not the Buddhist realm of peace and happiness, but an underground system of caves under Tibet that housed demons.  Shinkai apparently took these and several other stories of lore and built them into this tale.  In his version the beast guardians are 'Quetzalcoatl' (reference to the Aztec and Mayan god) and they are to keep the 'Topsiders' from entering Agartha.  Well, two and a half hours would be boring if we didn't see Agartha, so very early on Asuna and Morisaki enter Agartha and the viewer is treated to a visual tour de force.

The characters Asuna and Shun remind me of Sheeta and Pazu from Castle in the Sky.  Shin reminds me a LOT of Ashitaka from Mononoke, even riding a steed (a horse in this film instead of a weird gazelle thing) and even to the cutting off of his hair scene.  The denizens of Agartha also remind me of the people in Castle in the Sky with the Quetzalcoatl things similar to the 'gods' from Mononoke.  Even Mimi reminds me a bit of the cat/squirrel from Nausicaa.  But these nods to Miyazaki's films don't really seem to ideas stolen for the nature of the plot or film, instead it seems Shinkai is saying ""Miyazaki, you are great and I want to put this little touch here and there since you influenced me so much.""  Though the similarities abound, Shinkai has made this his own film.

Shinkai loves weaving high quality computer imagery into his backgrounds.  This is actually the first of his films where I felt the characters were rather simply drawn.  It works well.  They all have a plain appearance similar to the characters in Miyazaki films.  Therefore the viewer is drawn to the gorgeous backgrounds and the story.  There is a little action, but it's well integrated.  The part where the helicopter came up over the cliff was pretty awesome (it's early on - no spoiler).  Once the duo enters Agartha, Shinkai turns on his imagination and weaves architecture and sculptures from dozens of ancient civilizations into a believable and dramatic underworld realm.

This is only Shinkai's 3rd full length film.  That's right.  3rd!  Voices of a Distant Star was a short film that Shinkai made almost on his own (and which catapulted him to fame - at least in Japan and in anime circles).  The Place Promised in Our Early Days was an amazing film, and I loved it so much.  The next film, 5 Centimeter Per Second, was equally amazing, though much more subtle.  With 'Children' I think Shinkai might have found his stride.  The weaving of a beautiful story with gorgeous, fantastic imagery is so seamless.  Since Miyazaki is (semi) retired, there is a void in the Japanese anime industry that I don't think Goro Miyazaki (Hiyao's son) can properly fill.  Arietty was evidence of this (good - but not like the old Miyazaki stuff).  Shinkai gets into the fantastic realms that Miyazaki explored with Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Princess Mononoke.

This is one of the best full length anime films I have seen in years.  Probably since Howl's Moving Castle.  I cannot recommend this highly enough for fans of Shinkai, Miyazaki, or just wonderful and rich fantasy storytelling.  Bravo!",1353628800,5,4496,4.687100893997446

The colors are so vivid that they just scream out of the screen, when Shun faces that bear thing with his crystal I was just awe struck.

The ideas behind this create questions that everyone should consider, life and death and what it means to be a human being.

5019060,4,B006U239KU,"This latest work by Makoto Shinkai, the creator of the groundbreaking Voices of a Distant Star and the masterpiece 5 Centimeters per Second, addresses his usual theme of the painful end of relationships - only this time through the ultimate barrier - death.  To give an idea of what to expect, imagine Haibane Renmei as a movie directed by Miyazaki and you might not be that far off.

It begins with Asuna, a young girl who, although cheerful, suffers from lonliness with a single mom who loves her but is largely absent because she has to work night shifts to support her, and has trouble connecting with people although we see at least one girl making overtures of friendship to her.  Before heading home from school, her pregnant teacher, about to go on maternity leave, warns the children in her class to head straight home - preferably not alone - as there have been reports of a bear in the vicinity.  Of course, since there wouldn't be much of a story if nothing happened, Asuna heads to her private hangout instead and is attacked en route not by a bear, but a freaky creature resembling a mutant cross between a bear and an ankylosaurus.  She is rescued by an older boy named Shun who seems to know exactly what to do in such an emergency - a pretty big tip off that he isn't just an ordinary boy.

Asuna connects with gentle, warmhearted Shun hard and fast in the short time she knows him, eagerly coming back to see him the next day.  However, there is obviously something very wrong with him - and after he doesn't show when she goes to see him yet again her mother has the difficult task of informing her that Shun's body has been found.  In spite of his fear, in a final act of kindness he has made sure that she was not present at his death so that she would not have to witness such a thing, and he has tragically died during the previous night.

Asuna finds herself listening intently to her new substitute teacher Morisaki as he tells a myth about the underworld and the possibility of bringing people back from the dead.  Her shock and grief compounded by the appearance of Shun's younger brother Shin, a boy closer to her own age who looks just enough like him to cause her painful confusion and false hope, Asuna finds that the myth might not be as wild as most people would believe.  Going on a surreal journey, Asuna encounters many strange creatures and dangers to find if there is a way to bring Shun back.  The story ends by answering the question: in the event that we could indeed bring our loved ones back, would the price be too high?

There is alot of fantastical imagery, but there are also some very realistic scenes as well.  Anyone who has been on either end of the first conversation a parent has to have with their child about the death of a beloved pet, the first grandparent they lose, or - God forbid - someone younger in their lives will be able to relate with the awkward conversation between Asuna and her Mom about Shun; and although details can't be discussed because they border on spoiler territory, Asuna's slowly developing relationships with both Shin and Mr. Morisaki build to pay offs with emotional dividends.

I don't know if I'd put Children Who Chase Lost Voices in Masterpiece territory, but it's certainly a fine movie which should be watched by anyone ready to give the subject matter a whirl.",1353110400,2,3352,4.508250825082508

5019062,5,B006U239KU,"This is truly one of the best animes I have ever watched,the intensity and emotion behind each of the characters and their actions is overwhelming at times and these emotions certainly won't fail to move any person who has had any relation to love, loss of someone important or simply just a person who has the felt the warmth of motherly love. Story is great and I like the fact that it doesn't beat around the bush but it constantly keeps focusing on the most important aspects of the movie. The development of the main character, Asuna, and her relationship to the other characters as we move forward in the movie.

The art was what was truly amazing about the anime and definitely its selling point. Nearly every scene involving the environment or the atmosphere around our characters was simply breathtaking and almost without comparison. In addition to these scenes being absolutely amazing there weren't just a few of them but this movie was filled with beautiful landscapes and sky sceneries. Especially the night skies are particularly beautiful. The sound was almost as amazing,fitted perfectly with the sceneries and the movements and expressions of the characters.

I was really entertained throughout the whole movie and it kept moving me. Great story, beautiful animation, perfectly fitting soundtracks and very enjoyable characters. Apart from a this, the movie had a lot of touching morals and enlightening views on life and death. Two very heavy subject which were handled with grace.",1348790400,60,1501,5.048387096774194

8504354,4,B006U239KU,"Decent movie. Kinda hard to believe the decision made at the end by one character but whatever, I will let it slide. Didn't really make me all that emotional, and I can get extremely emotional when it comes to movies/shows.",1502409600,,223,4.6
8504355,3,B006U239KU,"Personally for me, I found Children Who Chase Lost Voices to be the on the weaker side of Makoto Shinkai works.

Why?

Because the emotional arc of the main character had little payoff and was never fully fleshed out for it to be satisfying conclusion.

Don't get me wrong this has pieces of a great film with an interesting world, mystery, and plot.

However Makoto films have always stood out because of his excellent portrayal of characters, often times fleshing out relationships that feel real and have emotional weighed behind them.

Unfortunately this is where the film stumbles. As I said before Asuna (main) character arc is where the movies falters. I understood where Makoto was trying to take her inner character, but it just felt rushed and frankly a bit muddled for any sort of emotional payoff.

Which in turn leads to an unsatisfactory conclusion as the story is wrapping up.

I'm seeing all these reviews saying how amazing this film is. Well frankly I'm here to write this review to give a more down to earth voice.

This is a fairly solid film but in comparison to Makoto other works I think it simply doesn't hold up.",1493942400,,1137,4.678391959798995
