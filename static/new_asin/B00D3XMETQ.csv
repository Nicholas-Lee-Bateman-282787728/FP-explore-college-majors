5773129,4,B00D3XMETQ,"This is a very well-acted and written show. The situations are very imaginative. Great humor. The plot-lines are very off-beat, which I usually do not like, but this show is so well done that I recommend it.",1390953600,2,207,4.621621621621622
5773130,5,B00D3XMETQ,this show cracks me up the guys a total jerk but somehow you like him!  dysfunctional family really adds to it,1387497600,,110,4.238095238095238

5773132,5,B00D3XMETQ,Jason priestly finally found something to not over act and pull a captain Kirk in. This show is raunchy lacking any moral fiber and I like it! If you like shows where the main character embraces making the wrong choices constantly;this show is for you.,1383004800,,252,4.622222222222222
5773133,5,B00D3XMETQ,"Jason Priestley and his crew of actors does a fantastic job in this adult comedy. I've loved it since the first episode or the first season. It so different from most shows that are trying to break the next boundary of edgy or adult.  This show is just a self-absorbed used car salesman (screw pre-owned) and all the troubles in his life that a good time Sinatra want-to-be can charm his way through. You really need to watch the first two seasons but it is the kind of show you can enjoy from any episode. I believe you could make a drinking game out of how many times he and the cast tell Larry to ""Shut the F... Up Larry""!  The show is pure fun.",1358985600,,648,4.176
8589231,4,B00D3XMETQ,"Hilarious! I am not going to write a review. But, take my word, if you like somewhat raunchy humor Ala Sunny in Philadelphia, etc. You will love this show!",1529971200,,155,4.379310344827586
8589232,5,B00D3XMETQ,"This third season of the Canadian ""dirtbag"" hit CALL ME FITZ has Fitzie (Jason Priestley) moving into local politics.  What could go wrong?  Well, a lot to anyone who underestimates the competition.  Delightful show, not for little kids -- but if you're new to this see seasons One and Two first.",1510876800,3,296,4.764705882352941
8589233,5,B00D3XMETQ,Fitz is Fitz. You love him or you hate him.,1487894400,,43,3.4
8589234,5,B00D3XMETQ,"I've been a huge fan since the 90s and Beverly  Hills, 90210 and seen a lot of Jason Priestley's work since. He plays the role of Richard  ""Fitz"" Fitzpatrick so well.  It was weird to see him play a character so totally opposite of Brandon Walsh all those years ago, but I'm loving it.  I'm on Season 3, Episode 7.",1464393600,,314,4.183333333333334

8589239,5,B00D3XMETQ,Awesome show! Great writing! Great acting! Very unsuitable for young children and religious families! This show is going to be an Arrested Development in five years. People will discover it and wonder why the hell it never caught on. There will be enough interest to put together another season only available on Netflix. Similar genre to Wilfred. Some of this stuff is just a little bit beyond the reach of your everyday TV watcher.,1398124800,2,433,4.864864864864865
8589240,5,B00D3XMETQ,"I'm surprised this hasn't made it to American TV, but it would have to be on a pay station, since there's more creative vulgarity than can be heard anywhere-- creative and very funny. Jason Priestley is too damn good, and the cast in general has been awesome. I've watched every season, and as soon as season 4 is on DVD, I'll be there with my checkbook (It's playing now in Canada.)",1397952000,2,383,4.408450704225352
