8551637,5,B00AHJLB4I,"This is a very good film to watch about the God given gift of Children. We should return to the Biblical view of children, and should not let the culture dictate to us how we raise them and how many we should have. All parents who are interested in continuing in God's path should watch this movie.",1438128000,,298,4.245614035087719

8551639,5,B00AHJLB4I,"This documentary was very well researched and presented. Many of those who were interviewed and gave their input were well-known figures in the pro-life movement and in other Christian circles, having researched, studied, written articles for widely-circulated magazines, observed the behaviors and practices of the professing Church for many years, etc. The Church is mimicking the world, God's sworn enemy, in so many ways. As indicated in this documentary, in their use and practice of birth control methods, they are denying the many basic truths of the Bible--that children are a blessing, that an all-wise God is in absolute control, that we can trust Him, that the world's philosophies are contrary to God's way of thinking and many other truths.

I would recommend this documentary to any Christian who is really serious about living their life in a God-glorifying manner, particularly, those who are wrestling with the issue of birth control. Is it right to practice birth control? This documentary traces the history of these philosophies and their impact our culture and the Church. It offers many insights to share with younger married couples or those contemplating marriage and is an encouragement to those who already have a foundation in the facts presented.",1376956800,3,1274,5.275862068965517
8551640,5,B00AHJLB4I,"The rest of the populace is more wicked than even the heathen themselves. For most married people do not desire offspring. Indeed, they turn away from it and consider it better to live without children, because they are poor and do not have the means with which to support a household. But this is especially true of those who are devoted to idleness and laziness and shun the sweat and the toil of marriage. But the purpose of marriage is not to have pleasure and to be idle but to procreate and bring up children, to support a household. This, of course, is a huge burden full of great cares and toils. But you have been created by God to be a husband or a wife and that you may learn to bear these troubles. Those who have no love for children are swine, stocks, and logs unworthy of being called men or women; for they despise the blessing of God, the Creator and Author of marriage."" ~ Martin Luther As quoted in 'The Baby War'

This film tackles head on one of the most important issues of our day: the destruction and denial of marriage. Marriage is a picture of Christ and the church and anything that denies that picture is a blasphemy against that image and thus a blasphemy against our Lord.

Marriage is under assault in our day from practically all directions: Sodomy, adultery, divorce, fornication, the denial of sex roles...

""It is impossible to reconcile the doctrine of the divine institution of marriage with any modernistic plan for the mechanical regulation of or suppression of human life. The Church must either reject the plain teachings of the Bible or reject schemes for the ` scientific' production of human souls.

Carried to its logical conclusion, the committee's report, if carried into effect, would sound the death knell of marriage as a holy institution by establishing degrading practices which would encourage indiscriminate immorality. The suggestion that the use of legalized contraceptives would be ` careful and restrained' is preposterous.""

The Washington Post, March 22, 1931

... and so-called birth control and abortion. The recently released film `The Baby War: Defenders and Defectors' tells the important story of the `defection' of two important players from the war. It outlines the story of the battle in the church and the United States government that turned them from being pro-child to being pro-birth control.

Most modern Christians, assuming they are willing to watch this film, will be shocked at the `naivte' of the early Christians and their own government in opposing such a mundane and routine thing as birth control. They will recognize the arguments, first put forth by the eugenecist Margeret Sanger, why birth control is the `Christian' thing to do.

But they will not recognize the logic of the arguments put forward, unanimously, by the church throughout the ages. They will not recognize, and they will certainly not accept, the idea that birth control represents a horrible sin, a direct attack on marriage, a horrible blasphemy against the picture of Christ and the church.

Ezekiel 2:  And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.

This is a film that needed to be made, but I am afraid it is a film that will not be seen. And, if seen, will not be understood. But it needs to be said, anyway. Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, the words of the LORD need to be spoken.

On the purely technical level this film has some issues. The music is very distracting and annoying, especially to people with any kind of hearing issue, at times seeming to overwhelm the speaking track. The introduction (ie first few minutes) of the film are excruciatingly boring (seriously, showing all of the people that will be in the film, their names, their tiles, in little boxes?).
I hate talking head films but this one has a lot less talking headness than most.

But on the philosophical level this film is a `must see' for Christians. Those who already know the truth of these things should watch it to arm themselves for the fight. And those who don't, should. But will they? And, having watched, will they learn? Only God can bring that increase.",1364169600,5,4204,4.782068965517241
8551641,5,B00AHJLB4I,"A POWERFUL documentary! My wife and I had the honor of being the first to preview this documentary. It will open your eyes and break your heart.  It is incredible to see just how far our the US and the church has come from being a defender of procreation as a part of marriage to a defector.  As a result we can no longer truly define marriage.  The videotography, score and production are first rate and the message is powerful.",1357862400,2,429,4.3375
