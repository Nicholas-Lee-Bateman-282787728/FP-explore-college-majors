2270228,4,B00097E6P4,"I don't want to call this a ""Tear Jerker"", but in some ways there has some elements that could have the makings for one. We have a teenage girl who's pretty, talented in writing, and can sing, but she's doomed to death as she's suffering with terminal cancer of the brain. She decides it's best to just cut everyone off from her, but God doesn't have that for her, and then enter Craig on fire for the Lord, or so everyone thinks, but in his heart he feels a lacking as he's doing the Lord's work, but his soul is crying out for passion. Enter Darby Peters the girl with terminal cancer to the brain. She shows toughness, but Craig won't give up on her, and once he starts being her friend her wall starts to crumble, but Craig wants to go the next step further(not sex),and that's to lead her to the Lord, but Craig hits some obstacles, and some of it is from himself. The one scene in this movie is when Craig is talking to his youth minister, and he tells Craig that God will direct a person to him in his own time, but Craig doesn't want to hear that because Darby's nearing the end, and then there's Darby's lack of faith where once she may have believed in God, but because of the illness she blames God, and while it's o.k. to tell God how angry and hurt you are to remember to pray for guidance, wisdom, and strength. There's another scene that I found rather interesting is where after Craig and Darby have an argument, and Craig leaves, and Darby goes home, and reads the Bible, but if you look outside her living room window it looks like Craig's out there jogging back and forth, and while I'm sure that Craig was praying hard for her soul, and so forth it was rather interesting they portrayed it that way. The best scene would have to be at the Youth Revival where Darby sings about seeing the love of Jesus in Craig's eyes. A very beautiful touching song, and if I can find it somewhere on a cd I will buy it; Craig can now be at peace that Darby will be in heaven when she dies, but he prays that he'll have somewhat of a life with her, and that's done up rather well when Darby goes on a family trip, and leaves Craig her memoirs which helps Craig know that Darby wants him too. I say this is geared towards teenagers, but for adults on the rebound whether through divorce, or being widowed like me. This can be still inspiring as it can help ignite your passions again, it can also remind you to seek the Lord. This was a little bit too much at times, but it's still worth watching.",1157932800,9,2500,4.2322175732217575
2270229,5,B00097E6P4,"To quote the film: This is the final edition point of view.  I saw the movie on TV (I'm not sure what station) and absolutely had to get the video.  The film is touching and poignant, very relevant for today's teens who are dealing either with a life-altering condition, such as cancer, or with a personal struggle to understand why life is as it is.  I would strongly recommend this film, not just to teens, but to anyone who needs understanding in their life.  The film is excellently directed and very well-acted; the story comes full circle in just over an hour.  The way Craig shows Darby the way to peace and understanding is very similar to the way that my wife is helping me in my walk with Jesus.  Overall, the movie is outstanding, delivering a purpose while tugging at the viewer's heart strings.",972000000,6,807,4.531034482758621
2270230,4,B00097E6P4,"tense, absorbing, a miracle!  this shows that the love shared by 2 teenagers and their creator does not have to deteriorate into just another love triangle tale.  my only quibble: they obviously sped up Craig's  spinning backfist in the climatic fight to make him seem more formidable",960595200,,284,5.0
2270251,5,B00097E6P4,"A VERY Christian movie, so if you're not at all religious, you'll likely find this a little pushy from the God-side.  But, if you are a Christian, you'll enjoy it.  The plot isn't deep or profound, but it's a satisfying watch--a happily-ever-after sort of movie, in that even though the heroin dies, you are certain she's headed to a better place where she, her new-found love, and even her parents will join her someday.  Leaves you not feeling sad but sort of satisfied.",1462406400,,472,4.662650602409639
2270252,5,B00097E6P4,First movie I cried ever I think. I spent years seeking this movie title. Love it.,1405728000,,82,4.1875
2270253,5,B00097E6P4,A very touching story of true love and sacrifice and dedication and giving oneself for someone you love. I'd watch it again.,1397779200,,124,4.681818181818182
2270254,5,B00097E6P4,Another great video by the Christiano Brothers. Very touching story of a young woman dying of cancer and the young man who falls in love with her and leads her to Christ before her death. Get out the kleenix.,1391126400,,208,4.358974358974359
2270255,5,B00097E6P4,The movie Love Note was very Good.  The movie was really a movie about salvation and accepting Jesus Christ which is not often seen in modern films.  The movie is short and right to the point.  I really love the theme song and I watch this movie allot even though I am not a teenager anymore.  This is a great family film and can be enjoyed for the whole family and especially the folks that don't know Jesus and need salvation.,1374969600,,428,4.246913580246914
2270256,5,B00097E6P4,"I love christian movies, or movies that have a powerful Godly message behind them, and I have seen a lot of christian movies, and this is 1 of the best I have seen so far, granted it was filmed in the 80's or early 90's but it is still AMAZING none the less. I think this movie is a lot like Fireproof- a christian message around a couple in love.

I don't want to give too much away, but the main character Craig is a christian young man that is looking for more in life than just the ordinary. He then meets the girl that will become the love of his life... the story evolves around them. He teaches her things, but the most important the true way to salvation, and encourages her to have a relationship with God.

I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a good Christian love story... and like the other reviews mentioned.. you will probably cry like my friends and I did!",1346284800,,887,4.242603550295858
2270257,5,B00097E6P4,LOVE NOTE is a poignant movie;excellently done. It will hold your interest from beginning to end. I highly recommend it for high school age to adults.,1342310400,,150,4.8076923076923075
2270258,5,B00097E6P4,"What a true example of the Love of Jesus in this teenaged boy.  Even when she seems to be unlovable, unreachable, & untouchable, he reached out to her anyway.  Later, she gave her life to Jesus.",1329091200,,194,4.361111111111111
2270259,5,B00097E6P4,"This is a good movie for to view. It was not a typical tear jerker movie. However, it will touch you deeply as you see this young man who gets to know this new girl in his school little by little. He has good intentions and always asks help from God. He deeply wants to understand what is troubling her and show her that God can help. He doesn't know why see is so bitter and tries to show her that life is not so hopeless. She finds the love of God and believes in his eternal love. This story makes you feel emotinal and you feel that you are not alone and that God loves us and gave his life for us. You will like this movie.",1320537600,,628,3.9140625
2270260,4,B00097E6P4,"It could have been the typical tear jerker movie of the 80's. However, it touch us deeply as the young man who knows the new girl in his school little by little has really good intentions and always asks help to God. He uses to go to church and at the same time falls in love with the girl and makes her change her mind about hopelessness as she is dying of a brain cancer. He makes her love God and believe in his eternal love. This story makes us feel emotinal and feel we are not alone and someone beyond all powers loves us and gave his life for us. Watch it without fear of crying, after all the tears shed are not in vain. I only gave 4 stars as in my opinion the film is very short, around 65 minutes.. otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",1223078400,,747,3.986666666666667
8058241,4,B00097E6P4,"The last ten minutes had me bawling my eyes out. A little fast paced on the whole conversion to Christianity but overall, a good movie.",1510272000,,135,4.44
8058242,5,B00097E6P4,"Maybe by today's standards this movie doesn't rate 5 stars, but it sure caught my attention.  And I was absolutely hooked by the song that Darby sang, called Shining Through Your Eyes of Love, reminding me of my late husband.  I was unable to catch all the words to it, & searched the internet for the music & lyrics to no avail.",1508112000,,329,4.290322580645161
8058243,1,B00097E6P4,"This is not a ""classic"" movie. It's propaganda on behalf of the tax-exempt invisible father god in the sky cult. Couldn't stomach more than a few minutes. Amazon is scraping the bottom of the barrel to run these ""faith films.""",1507334400,,226,4.675

8058245,5,B00097E6P4,"I watched this movie off of the star rating. It did not disappoint! I was surprisingly pleased with all of it. The story itself, the acting, the humor as well as Christian side of it was really really good. I would tell my friends & family about and recommend.",1503705600,,260,4.326530612244898

8058248,5,B00097E6P4,Great movie!,1501286400,,12,5.5
8058249,5,B00097E6P4,This is a Christian movie in every sense of the word.  I like how it was presented from the point of view that you can't force someone to accept Jesus.  You can only show them the way and pray they will make the decision to follow Him.  Without using big name stars and a elegant production the message of this movie is presented very well.,1500163200,,340,4.2
8058250,5,B00097E6P4,I don't know how we missed this wonderful portrayal of leading someone to Christ. I have seen many of Ken Anderson's works and just love this one.,1499731200,2,146,4.444444444444445
