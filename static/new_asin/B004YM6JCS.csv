4500797,2,B004YM6JCS,"The premise is quirky & neat, but doesn't do enough to carry the lackluster plot, and dull scenes.  The stories are just ok, the relationships have cute moments, but ultimately the dialogues begin to feel repetitious very quickly.",1322352000,2,230,5.052631578947368

4500799,4,B004YM6JCS,"Young lawyer Ryan Newman has lost his job and is left feeling depressed and contemplating suicide. Taking up an offer to dogsit his neighbour's pooch, he is bemused to find that he sees Wilfred as a guy in a dog costume, whilst everyone else sees him as a real dog. Wilfred, a pot-smoking connoisseur of movies and TV, befriends Ryan and helps improve his self-confidence...but he also commits random acts seemingly designed to annoy and undermine him. As their relationship develops, Ryan tries to work out who or what Wilfred really is.

Wilfred started life as an Australian TV show before being transplanted to the USA, with co-creator/actor Jason Gann reprising his role as the eponymous man/dog/hallucination/whatever. It is a surreal show mixing elements of relationship dramas with comedy, geek-friendly references and even hints of tragedy. The show's central 'mystery' - who or what is Wilfred? - is kept at a fairly low ebb through most of the first season, only really emerging to the fore in the last episode. The creators gleefully play on the audience's past experiences with such mystery-based shows, with Wilfred eventually revealing to Ryan (Elijah 'Frodo Baggins' Wood) his secret is that he needs to get off the Island and evade the smoke monster (""I've seen Lost!"" ""What did you think of the ending?""), to Ryan's frustration.

The show's comedy is based around the bizarre relationship between Wilfred and Ryan, with Wilfred expressing canine-like behaviour in human terms but still being susceptible to dog foibles (being distracted by a bubble machine, mesmerised by a laser pointer on a wall or forming a lasting sexual relationship with a stuffed toy). From the other direction, Ryan's self-confidence and ability to form friendships has been eroded to the point where he seems to become psychologically dependent on Wilfred. However, as Ryan recovers his self-esteem he reveals a cold and manipulative side which is surprisingly harsh (and masterfully showcased in the season's grand finale).

Whilst there are a few recurring castmembers and some great cameos (My Name is Earl's Ethan Suplee, Malcolm in the Middle's Jane Kaczmarek, The Hangover's Ed Helms and a totally random appearance by Eric Stoltz), the show is mostly a two-hander between Gann and Wood. The two actors are on top form throughout the series, whether it's engaging in a dramatic showdown in the rain on a hospital roof, trying to catch each other out with Dune quotes or assessing Ryan's ability to watch an entire season of The Wire in one sitting (""That stuff is dense!""). Wood undercuts his young clean-cut image through his portrayal of a character who takes drugs and, increasingly as the season progresses, emotionally manipulates those around him, whilst Gann is simply excellent as the morally questionable Wilfred (complete with a slightly surreal English accent he puts on whenever he does anything villainous). Neither character is hugely likable, but they are certainly entertaining.

As the season progresses we get more clues as to what is going on (most notably in an episode involving Mary Steenburgen as Ryan's mother, who is in a home for the emotionally bewildered) before the impressive finale, which takes together a number of very minor and apparently unconnected subplots from throughout the season and ties them together neatly to form an impressive cliffhanger. On the negative side, there is a slight feeling of repetitiveness to the premise (though the writers do a good job of keeping things as fresh as possible) and the un-likability of most of the characters occasionally makes watching the show feel slightly pointless, until the next clever line or nice piece of characterisation comes along. However, the episodes are short, sharp and amusing enough to keep things moving along nicely whenever they do start to flag.

Wilfred: Season 1 (****) is an entertaining show with a nice line in self-awareness. Whether the premise is strong enough to support multiple seasons (a second season is on its way for next year) remains to be seen, but so far it's worth watching. The show will be released in the next few months in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1320537600,3,4187,5.097667638483965
4500800,5,B004YM6JCS,"This show is amazing! Both actors work great together. I've loved this series since its debut. CHeck it out, you won't be disappointed!",1317600000,4,135,4.913043478260869
4500801,5,B004YM6JCS,"It's a simple but bizarre premise -- a suicidal young man encounters a dog that looks (to him) like an Australian man in a dog costume. Yeah, that's the premise, and it didn't sound any less insane in the original Australian sitcom. But somehow ""Wilfred"" works beautifully, mainly from a combination of clever/dark/gross/twisted humor and the chemistry between Elijah Wood and Jason Gann.

Depressed by his joyless life, ex-lawyer Ryan Newman (Wood) tries to commit suicide... and fails miserably, leaving him with no job, a nasty neighbor and an angry pushy sister. Then his beautiful neighbor Jenna (Fiona Gubelmann) asks him to look after her dog Wilfred during the day. Everyone else sees Wilfred as a dog, but Ryan sees him as... well, a pot-smoking Australian man in a dog suit.

Ryan soon finds that Wilfred is everything he's not, and ends up being dragged into a celebration of joie de vivre by the devious canine. What comes next is vet trips, angry neighbors, a horrifying doggy daycare, insane single moms, Jenna's jerk boyfriend, Wilfred's ""gift"" for detecting imminent death, a ghostly dog collar, Ryan's similarly loopy mom, and Ryan wondering if he should continue his friendship with the dog.

It's never made entirely clear if Wilfred (as Ryan sees him) is real, or if Ryan's unbalanced mind is just making him up to cope with reality. And honestly, ""Wilfred"" is as enjoyable as it is because it leaves you wondering --
it's dark, twisted, weird, and gets pretty warped at times (the stories include suicide, drugs, assault, peanut butter, and the molestation of stuffed animals!).

And it's HILARIOUS.

Well, not all of the humor is twisted -- we have fun scenes like Ryan racing through the streets in a cape, or falling into a giant hole Wilfred dug. But there is a lot of wonderfully weird stuff, from dialogue (""Why is the sky grey? Why is the grass grey? Why is a rainbow grey, grey, grey, grey, grey and infra-grey?"") to the main plots (the peanut butter animal-abuse story, which I cannot recount here... but it's R-rated). And lotsa lotsa four-letter words.

However, I also love the pairing of Elijah Wood and Jason Gann. Gann also played Wilfred in the original Aussie series, so this role fits him like a well-worn shoe. He's deadpan, devious and very inappropriate. And Elijah Wood -- an actor who doesn't fit into ""typical"" roles -- is perfectly cast as the wide-eyed, timid, desperate Ryan, whose life quickly turns into a Wilfredcentric hurricane.

""Wilfred"" is weird, wild, warped and sometimes wacky -- a dark comedy with a strange premise, which succeeds thanks to its brilliant cast and dark humor.",1316131200,24,2636,4.910112359550562
4500802,5,B004YM6JCS,"I like many different types of shows, though sitcoms and primetime TV don't usually fall into that list.  I enjoy british comedies such as Coupling, Monty Python, The IT Crowd, and US shows such as Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, etc.  This shows commercials and clips always made it seem bizarre and perhaps a show for the junkies of the world, perhaps it is, but its not JUST for them.  I feel this shows humor ranges from subtle, to feel-good/inspiring, to in-your-face, twisted.  Some might see a cheap laugh, or what they might consider to be one, but I feel everything in the show has thought behind it.  I don't find any of the characters that 2D at all, and there is plenty of character development and relatable feelings throughout.  Theres plenty of shock value, and a feeling that there is a silver lining around the gloom in life. I would suggest this show to anyone that needs a laugh, plus anyone thats an animal lover, or hater, or might have been depressed, someone that loves to express one self, someone that wants to tell of their boss or family member....really, anyone should be able to enjoy this show provided they aren't offended by fiction or cursing.

4500876,5,B004YM6JCS,"The chemistry between Wood and Gann is clear form the first episode and this was something I found lacking in the Australian original. You want to keep watching and see how Ryan, Wood's character, adapts and grows from being a suicidal loner giving up on life, to engaging his neighbors and co-workers because of his unlikely friendship with a talking dog. At times you wonder if Wilfred has Ryan's best interests in mind, but he's always there to pick up the pieces. The way Gann acts like a dog, like when he yells at people and Ryan can hear what he's saying while everybody else hears just barking is funny, and leaves you wondering what dogs are really saying. Although sometimes dark and crude, this is the story of an unlikely friendship between a man who may or may not be insane and his neighbor's pet who Ryan sees as a man in a dog suit.",1455580800,,848,4.4423076923076925

I can understand how some people would be turned off by the premise it is not for everyone but what show is. The ""talking"" dog is only in Ryan's head and once you rationalize that it is hard to stop watching. Some people may not be able to do that but it is ultimately about his mental illness - or is it....It hits on some serious topics for sure and can be raunchy but what you need to realize is that this is his mind and who hasn't had some strange thoughts that if they were heard would cringe. Of course his are crazier that most but its because of the life he has lead up to this point.. All in all I would recommend this piece. Definitely on the dark comedy side - Elijah Wood is excellent.",1445990400,,797,4.018867924528302

4500974,1,B004YM6JCS,"***Spoiler Alert*** I hate to give this show a low rating. It has credible actors like Elijah Wood, Dorian Brown, James Remar, Dwight Yoakum and Rutger Hauer. The show even manages to be occassionally amusing. My biggest gripe is that scary, creepy dog Wilfred. I mean what is he? A manifestation of Ryan's psychosis or something worse? For me, Wilfred gives off a darkly sinister vibe, if not outright SATANIC. The way he acts, behaves and takes over Ryan's life is the way the DEVIL would trick his way onto a helpless victim. He turns Ryan into a drug addict, a jobless bum and worse, an antisocial individual obsessed with a married woman. He encourages incest in Ryan towards his sister. Wilfred states he's happy that his brothers and sisters died inside a bag thrown in the ocean and the memory arouses him, I mean that's just diabolical!  He makes Ryan engage in criminal and sordid behaviors like theft, armed robbery, assault & battery, vandalism, adultery and defecating in public. And when Ryan comes to his senses and tries to get his life back in order, that Demonic Dog Wilfred reels him back into a life of sin using ""Wilfred-Lies"" and ""Wilfred-Manipulation"". Throughout the whole season you have the characters involved in public urination, talking about feces and rubbing their private parts all over everything.  Wilfred engages in atrocities like murder, attempted poisoning and copulating stuffed animals, he even causes the death of Ryan's father.  The Wilfred/Devil makes tea using his owner's panties and commits beastiality with a single mom.  Ruby the Nurse hints to the fact that Wilfred is a hell spawn when she says, ""he makes my bones rattle"" and ""that dog need to go back where he come from, the gates of hell!""  In the next scene she's conveniently killed.  Its actually quite horrifying to watch this show when you understand what's really going on underneath the cute exterior. Most texts on this topic describe SATANISM as involving talking animals, engaging in putrid behavior and other atrocities as portrayed in this show.  Remember, sin is desirable and attractive. Wilfred/Devil uses Ryan's attachment to him to manipulate him into a life of utter deviance. I expect the very last episode to have Wilfred/Devil taking off his dog costume and revealing that he's actually LUCIFER and laughing at Ryan. And then while burning in Hades, Ryan would scream, ""WHY?"" And Wilfred/Devil would say, ""you chose to commit those evil acts, I didn't make you do them, now pay the consequences, burn, HA HA HA HA HA!!!""",1405641600,2,2544,4.943793911007026

I like the storyline, and the mystery of Wilfred, and I can't wait to see how everything unfolds in it's last season (Season 5).  I have purposefully not seen the Australian version so nothing is given away.  I'm sad that the series is ending, but it is sometimes best at five seasons, especially when the creators had a plan that actually has an ending in mind and knew this was going to happen).

I will say that sometimes it is a little too raunchy, but I still love it. People have already said what it's about so I won't go into that, but to me it's definitely a must see. That acting is pretty good, the story plots in season 1 are great, the quotes at the beginning are always interesting and awesome, and it's always hilarious. You should definitely give Wilfred a try!",1363824000,,528,4.237623762376238
4501106,4,B004YM6JCS,"The actor who plays Wilfred is a genius with delivery, timing, expression and behavior. He has doggie style supreme and the show is just brilliant whether you're watching for laughs or for the deeper, psychological meaning.",1363046400,,223,5.222222222222222
4501107,3,B004YM6JCS,"At first glance Wilfred appears to be a ridiculously stupid show, but as a longtime fan and follower of Elijah Wood, I knew he wouldn't agree to do something like that, so I decided to give Wilfred a shot. The show is adapted from a very popular Australian show and if nothing else, it is extremely unique. Wood plays Ryan, a down on his luck man going through some changes. He has a hopeless crush on his new neighbor, Jenna, who to his surprise shows up one day and asks him to watch her dog, Wilfred. The thing about Wilfred is that he is actually a dog, that only Ryan sees as a man in a dog costume. Why does Ryan see Wilfred though, is he an angel, demon, spirit, or is Ryan just hallucinating? That is really the point of the show, Wilfred is there to help and guide Ryan, but what is he and why is Ryan the only one who sees him as human? When I first started watching this show, I thought it was absolutely hysterical. Some of the things Wilfred does and some of the words that come out of his mouth are shocking and hilarious, and how they get away with that on television is beyond me. Unfortunately the initial shock of this nut running around in a dog suit wears off pretty quickly and the episodes seem to blend together. It's a great idea and a unique show, but a lot of the episodes have a very similar storyline and don't really seem to go anywhere. The reason such a weird show works so well is it's extremely talented cast. Elijah Wood has always been a favorite actor of mine and when his quiet, reserved character is matched with Jason Gann and his extreme behavior, it's like watching a whole new take on the Odd Couple. Gann is a newcomer in America and was the one who played Wilfred in the original Australian version of the show. He's been playing Wilfred for years, he's comfortable in the role and none of this is new to him, and that's why he is so terrific. The show Wilfred can be a riot, but it gets old quick, and it's hard listening to moral lessons taught by a pot smoking man in a dog costume. That being said, it might not be the ideal show to watch on DVD as I did, but catching an episode or two on TV can defiantly make your night entertaining.",1362960000,,2184,4.2023809523809526
4501108,3,B004YM6JCS,Very dark humor. Enjoyed thoroughly. I did sit down and watch too many at a time which sometimes takes a good thing and only makes it okay- but all in all good.,1361145600,,160,4.03125
4501109,5,B004YM6JCS,"Wilfred is fantastic. Having seen advertisements for the program with a man in a dog suit, I at first thought it  would just be stupid.

4501145,5,B004YM6JCS,"This is a surreal, dark comedy, but not one void of a heart.  As a dog owner, there are many, many moments watching this series where I must laugh at the honest way they act out dog behaviors as a person would--""LOOK AT ALL THIS WATER! RYAN! IT'S A PELICAN! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!""--it all feels very honest and true.  And while not going into detail since it would be spoilers, there are moments that touched me so deeply that I cried, and I really didn't expect my heartstrings to be pulled in a surrealist black comedy.

It is unusual and most certainly one-of-a-kind. There are drugs, sex and swearing in abundance but not really over the top. If you start to feel uncomfortable at times, fear not! It will quickly change to laughter. The supporting characters are interesting with their many faults, but it is the developing relationship between Frodo and Wilfred that drives the show.

I remember seeing the preview to this show and knowing that it was something I wanted to see.

4501177,2,B004YM6JCS,I dislike this show and find the dog to be too mean. In order to enjoy watching a show I need to like some of the characters but there aren't any. My twenty-something year old niece loves it and finds it hilarious. There are some funny parts but I can't get past  the dog who doesn't fit my image of what  a dog's personality is like.,1350950400,,334,4.045454545454546
4501178,4,B004YM6JCS,"First of all, you probably need a kind of weird, offbeat, twisted, morbid sense of humor like I do to watch this show.  It's seriously unique, that's for sure.  Premise is basic enough, and I'll sum it up in a couple of sentences since you can just look it up yourself.  Ryan (Elijah Wood) is a lost slacker, used-to-be lawyer that tries to commit suicide, and his neighbor who he sort of has a crush on has a dog named Wilfred.  The catch is that only Ryan and the viewers see Wilfred as a grown man in a dog suit; everyone else just sees a dog.

That premise is strange enough, right?  Basically, Wilfred is constantly provoking Ryan and making him think, while being kind of a jerk who sets him up a lot to get him in trouble and in messy situations.  He's also sometimes creepy and a total liar.  Not to mention, this dog loves to smoke marijuana, drink booze and smoke cigarettes.  Yet he still does ""dog-like"" things, like being confused over a laser light, being overprotective of his owner, etc.

They touch on interesting themes, and have a ""feeling"" at the beginning of every episode that comes from a quote (anger, guilt, whatever).  Sometimes it's difficult to tell when this show is just being weird or is actually smart.  It is thought-provoking and like I said, a little creepy.  It's the perfect recipe for a cult classic, which it pretty much became right away.  If you have an open and strange sense of humor, give this show a chance and you might like it.",1350000000,,1474,4.451492537313433
4501179,5,B004YM6JCS,"There honestly isn't another tv show that is like this one. It combines existential philosophy, deep emotional situations, and hilarious comedy. All this combined with Elijah Wood's phenomenal acting has made it my favorite TV show.",1349395200,,232,5.472222222222222

4501182,5,B004YM6JCS,"Another great find on Netflix. The show follows a young man named Ryan (Elijah Wood) and his neighbor's dog Wilfred (Jason Gann). At first Ryan is suicidal, attempting to kill himself several times in the first episode. Ryan's neighbor, Jenna (Fiona Gubelmann), asks him to look after her dog for the day. Ryan is taken aback as he sees Wilfred as an Australian man in a dog suit, while everyone else sees Wilfred as just a dog.

This show is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend this for anyone that likes a good laugh. It has a good plot line, great characters, and the writing is awesome.",1346112000,,599,4.650943396226415

It took me 2 minutes to decide I like it, and that's saying something since I'm pretty critical with shows I hated before. Plus, the season finale is odd and it hangs cliffs.

4501221,5,B004YM6JCS,"When I heard that Frodo was going to be starring in this series, I was less than optimistic, in fact down right ticked. But I have eaten some serious humble pie, because IT WORKS! I cannot believe how different he is in this series, and how well he plays the character. I have to give him serious props.

Now on to the show, it's by far the funniest series I've seen in a long time. However, I don't think it's for everyone. I laugh and laugh, and it's pretty uncommon for me to stop laughing while the show is on. But my wife doesn't laugh at all, and every once in awhile will just smile. So it depends on your taste in humor. Tell me this isn't a funny line: ""Oh man, Wilfred just pooped on your lawn.""  .. ""There's symbolism in that poop Ryan, ... and a little grass ... and half a slipper.""

Another one that took me 3 days to stop laughing ""march right on over there and tell her how you feel.  ..but wait a few minutes, I just dropped my guts over there.""",1334620800,,962,4.101063829787234
