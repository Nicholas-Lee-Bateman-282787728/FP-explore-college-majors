8385972,4,B0030N0LTY,"This 1923 silent spy-adventure film doesn't have the greatest story but the generally high production values, location shooting around the Panama Canal and the appearance of the much-younger Bela Lugosi make it worthwhile. Picture quality is reasonably good and the film is accompanied by an orchestral score from canned sources but quite well edited to match the film.",1444435200,,369,5.379310344827586
8385973,5,B0030N0LTY,"Naturally, Bela Lugosi fans will enjoy this, he is in his usual 'sinister' role,as a foreign spy... Story moves along quite well w/ some subtitles...History buffs will love the early transmitting equipment in regular use,as well as vintage clips of pre WW1 'The Great White Fleet"" Navy ships.,all steam and coal fired. Extra bonus sort is fun, with 'Snub' Pollard,hamming it up as an inventor.... Great price,totally enjoyable,and unusually FINE print...",1396483200,3,454,5.408450704225352
