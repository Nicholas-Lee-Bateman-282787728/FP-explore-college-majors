When this show originally aired, it was a true archetype.  Shades of ""Surfside 6,"" ""Hawaian Eye,"" and maybe even ""Magnum.""  But it stood

on it's own.  Follow the adventures of Nick Slaughter and his trusty - and delectable - sidekick.

Island beauty, the salt air, bevies of bikini babes, and wonderfully outrageous plots abound.

I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

Tune back your brain, crack open a cold one, and wade into the water.",1168300800,3,467,4.75
