4881803,1,B005SDUUWM,This movie basically had no story line along with very poor acting.  The quality of the film was also poor.  Images were not clear.,1389657600,,131,4.416666666666667
4881804,4,B005SDUUWM,The movie is good if you enjoy the telling of it in a theatre sence.  However; the image I think is misleading for many will purchase it for the thought of showing lots of nudity which isn't the case.  I am tired of the gay industry selling movies with misleading content to sell their movies.  I think this could have showed more... skin without it being...a porno.  There is somewhat a plot but it could have been developed more.,1336608000,11,431,4.417721518987341

8484858,5,B005SDUUWM,"I like this film.  It realistically deals with the different aspects of Gay relationships.  May/September ones, past lovers, the Aids generation,etc.  It seems slow at first but gets into the nitty-gritty.",1461801600,4,205,5.548387096774194
8484859,2,B005SDUUWM,It was rather a boring movie. Watching each scene was excruciating. Being terminally ill doesn't mean you can't be totally out of positive interactions.,1454198400,,152,5.375
8484860,1,B005SDUUWM,"Just finished watching ""Phantom Images"" released by Ariztical Entertainment.
Tackling the main character's impending death as cancer rips through his body is never an easy task for the writer, director, and the actor portraying the main character - in this case Rob Moretti bringing the character of dying film maker Darwin King to life.
Director and writer Matthew Doyle isn't afraid to break through the fourth wall and invoke an intimate dialogue between King and the viewers of his visual, art film,  narrative essay.  Though its hard for me to have any sympathy for King - who is a monster, albeit a dying monster, of his own creation.
King has recreated and updated the script which is supposed to portray his life as a gay Jewish man and has recast himself in more contemporary times and the actor portraying him is now a black man on the downlow - perhaps.
King's memory and the parallel world he has created in his screen play  merge and begin to blur, yet King is using his impending death to deny himself any remaining life.
As faithful readers of my reviews know, I deduct points when directors, writers, and yes, even actors want to promote phony political propaganda.  I would have given ""Phantom Images,"" three stars, it's not a great movie; but it has an intriguing concept.  Yet if you want to promote Progressive Democratic Socialist lies about Guantanamo Bay I'm going to deduct two stars for the review.
Neat concepts and Progressive Democratic Socialism propaganda do not mix well.
One Star.",1451174400,,1512,4.844961240310077
