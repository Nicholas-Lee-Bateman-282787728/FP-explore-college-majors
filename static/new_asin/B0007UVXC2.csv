8052179,4,B0007UVXC2,"Of course, I think you'd struggle to make a movie about a naked super hero that wasn't kind of hilarious.
I'm not very familiar with the manga or anime versions of Kekko Kamen so I can't comment on how faithful this is to the source material.  For this version, the story centers on a school for television news readers (there are schools for that?) being run by a villainous school master with odd ideas about discipline, particularly for the young women attending the school.  But when these young women suffer from the ""special lessons"" of their teachers, Kekko Kamen shows up to save the day!  Why is she naked?  No idea, though I guess it would be hard to pull off her finishing move (""Muffication!"") if she were fully clothed....
Everything about this movie screams ""cheap.""  It looks like it was shot with a video camera, and the (thankfully few) special effects, well, let's say that ""Batman""-style Bam!'s and Pow!'s wouldn't be too out of place.  They might have even used the same fight choreographer....  But that just adds to the overall effect of the movie.  Every cheesy fight, every bad SFX scene just adds to the film's humor.
Plot wise, I think the movie could have benefited from a more standard structure - you know, villain #1 menaces a student, Kekko Kamen defeats him, then villain #2 ups the ante and so on.  The film suffers by having three clownish villains who never manage to distinguish themselves.
Overall this movie is easily worth a watch.  If you're still on the fence, here's a litmus test for you:  Kekko Kamen is a naked super heroine who uses the special finishing move of ""Muffication.""  If that makes you giggle, even a little, give it a shot.",1359936000,,1681,4.661016949152542
8052180,1,B0007UVXC2,"As wonderfully funny and silly as the Anime version of Kekko Kamen is, is how pathetic this live action is. All the humor of the original has been replaced by UNFUNNY gags and situations. No Nazi punishment teacher, no highschool students, actually nothing of the original. This is tame and pathetic in every way, not even mentioning the 2 dollar budget and poor video quality that even compared to the worst film at Troma would find unwatchable.",1217894400,,446,4.805194805194805
8052181,3,B0007UVXC2,"First off let me say that I am a Go Nagai freak. I mean I watch and buy anything with his name on it. I love all his animes (Iron Virgin Jun, Cutey Honey, Devil Man, Mazinger Z, etc.) and his live action movies (Cutie Honey, The Nija Dragon, etc.) Too bad most of his good stuff isn't officially available in the US. Anyway, that said keep in mind that I might be a little biased.

I really liked the Kekko Kamen OVAs (I wish that there were more episodes tough) and when i learned that there were live action movies, I was shocked. I mean this is a show about a school full of perverted and sadistic teachers and a heroine who wears nothing, but a mask. Needless to say curiousity forced me to buy the ones I could find. Now as you may know there are four live acion Kekko Kamen movies (the first was a theatrical film and the following three were direct-to-DVD films) This is the first in those direct-to-DVD films (the second overall) and first off as one might expect, the production values aren't as high as in the first film. Sets are re-used often, and the extras seem to be there as little as possible.

As for the plot that's an interesting point. The movies take a departure from the OVA and manga. Gone is the overly-strict co-ed prep school and the strangely costumed, Big Toenail of Satan. What we have here is a school fot girls that trains them to be celebrities (or better yet the wives of celebrities and politicians) The characters of the manga are still here somewhat Big Toenail is now just ""Mysterious School Master"" and there's a few new additions. The plot (Like the manga and OVA) centers around Mayumi, a young girl who is pretty stupid and seems to be the main object for the teacher's punishments. Her friends also go about breaking the many rules of the school (no leaving, no boys, no cell phones, etc.) and end up bringing the attention of the teachers on them. They find help in two people, the new teacher Keiko and the hero Kekko Kamen (who sadly doen't come out as much as you'd think.) One might think they are one and the same (the faculty does) but that's never fully revealed (in the manga Kekko Kamen was actually the sister of the obvious suspect). After Mayumi's friend Chiriko gets discoved bringing a boy into the school the plot picks up. The girls devise a plan to help the boyfriend win a contest in which he can pick whichever girl he wants. He does and... Well let's not give it all away.

There's not much to this movie, at only a little over 70 minutes (and that's including a music video) there's note musch substance. Kekko Kamen makes few appearances, and those she does make aren't as good as the first movie's. That said don't expect too much nuditiy here, just partial nudity here and there (if you're looking for softcore look elsewhere). On another note the subtitles provided are horrible. I know a lot of Japanese and I noticed that there were a lot of mistranslations and some dialogue isn't even translated at all! It's as if the translators didn't know what some phrases meant, or didn't think they were appropiate (most of the untranslated stuff are vulgar jokes) But the movie does have some funny perks, Golden Batman and Oppaidaman provide a few chuckles, and there are some intentional and unintentional funny bits throughout the movie. Overall I would say that unless you're a Go Nagai fan, liked the first movie,liked the original Kekko Kamen anime or if you just like B-movies Japanese or otherwise buy this one. If not, I would suggest picking up the anime, or the first live action movie. If you liked this one try tracking down the Devil Man live action movie, or better yet the Cutie Honey live action movie (my favorite of Go Nagai's movies)",1144627200,3,3717,4.51186943620178
8052182,2,B0007UVXC2,"Kekko Kamen is the live action version of Go! Nagai's manga and anime version of the stripped-down superheroine who exposes her body for the sake of justice.  She is very cool and actually female-empowering. The anime was funny, but this movie is a waste.  Parts of this DVD are funny, such as when the dimbulb main character can't read Kanji in class.  But we don't see enough of Kekko Kamen (no, I don't mean it THAT way!) She doesn't have very much screen time.  Any naughty parts are blacked out by huge blinding stars that cover most of her body!

The end is just embarrassing. They trot out pathetic villians that are not funny and no match for Kekko Kamen.  The actress who plays Kekko has beautiful eyes, can use the nunchakus, and is amazingly confident in the buff.  Too bad her talent was wasted.

There is an extra of a roomful of drooling Japanese men who have come to see the movie.  The three female leads and the director talk about making the film.

Seriously, stick with the anime.  This was a waste of 70 minutes of my life.",1122163200,19,1043,4.436842105263158
