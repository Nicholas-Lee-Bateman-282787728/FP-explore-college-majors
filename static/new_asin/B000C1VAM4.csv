8540841,5,B000C1VAM4,"I am very happy with this instructional step by step  dvd here. I got this today, and I have already learned a whole  lot more of how to exactly make several different types of floral (and also lots of  wedding florals)  arrangements, too. This is probably the very easiest way to learn (and even at your own pace). I recommend this dvd here to every one that wants to learn more about: THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF FLOWERS!!  I also add 4 stars to this dvd.",1221436800,5,452,4.270588235294118
