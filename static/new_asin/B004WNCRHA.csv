8445358,3,B004WNCRHA,"I bought vol1 and vol2 for my son who plays travel soccer U12. He has already started using some of the tricks he picked up from the DVD. This is not for a player younger that 10 years old. It also requires another skilled player/coach to practice or rehearse the move with the player. My son watches a couple of the moves over and over, then practice it in the backyard. I am now considering hiring a private coach to work with my son on some of these moves. If he can master some on these moves it would really build his confidence on the field.

I think the DVD really needs a coach or trainer to practice the moves with the kids.
