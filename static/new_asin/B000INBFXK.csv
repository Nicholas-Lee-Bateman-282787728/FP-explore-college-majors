in Israel.",1289088000,,111,5.588235294117647
8323683,4,B000INBFXK,I loved this film and its subtlety of emotions. The film follows Va'an and her father back to Vietnam to reclaim their ancestral lands and the journey is not exactly what they expected. I would have loved to see more of Va'an and her family's life in Israel and the complexities in their daily lives.,1220832000,,300,4.472727272727273

8323685,5,B000INBFXK,"I can't believe that I'm the first person to write a review for this documentary. This film has not merely touched my heart, it has changed the very way in which I see my own identity. Is Vaan Israeli? She doesn't fall into any of the categories that spring to my mind when I hear 'Israeli'. Vaan isn't Ashkenazi, or Sefardi, or Ethiopian, or Arab... But as I watched this film, my questions dissolved away, and I sat utterly captivated by Vaan's powerfully lyrical description of her situation, her frustrations, and her hopes -- in beautifully worded Hebrew, of course. Is Vaan Vietnamese? She can walk through the streets of Saigon without anyone giving her a second glance, but having been born and raised in Israel where is her home? Even though I feel that I have nothing in common with Vaan -- I am Jewish and American, Buddhist and Chinese -- I also feel as though I have grown up right next door to her. While Vaan's story is unmistakably unique, it is just as much the story of every immigrant, and every child and grandchild of every immigrant, no matter who you are, no matter where you are. When Vaan looks into the camera and says she wants to go home, I see myself on the screen. No documentary has ever touched me so deeply. There are so many questions and parallels that spring from this story, but you really must find them for yourself. It is definitely worth buying your own copy of this documentary without having seen it beforehand. I was so moved that I bought my own copy exactly 20 minutes after the credits rolled.",1163116800,12,1540,4.503571428571429
