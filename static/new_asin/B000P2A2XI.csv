2808484,5,B000P2A2XI,"I'd only done one other kickboxing program before and wasn't crazy about it, but my boyfriend is a huge fan of William CC Chen and wanted to do this with me -- and because I love the other Acacia DVDs I've tried, we gave it a shot.

WOW!  I love the first two workouts -- the interval training style seems to do more for me than other workouts I've tried and I just read an article in Oprah Magazine last month about how you will lose more weight through explosive plyometrics for 30-second intervals in between more measured movement for 30 minutes than you will in a 90 minute steady pace workout.  After trying this, I believe it.

I'm still not coordinated enough to pull off the last workout, but I adore the first one and I'm getting more comfortable with the second one all the time.  Tiffany's coaching is awesome.  And my boyfriend (who follows such things) told me that Max just won another fight and is getting closer to qualifying for the USA Team in the Olympics in kickboxing.

This is SOOO different from an aerobics gym girl teaching a ""cardio-kickboxing class"" -- which I find really annoying.  This is the real thing that real fighters use to get in real shape, broken down into workouts that let you start off at a beginner level and work your way up.

I'm not a fighter, but this has done wonders for me.  I love it!",1190419200,20,1336,4.394308943089431
2808485,5,B000P2A2XI,"This is a real working work-out for the serious martial artist as well as someone who wants to keep in first class shape.  Max and Tiffany Chen, in their own incomparable style, present a conditioning work-out that is accessible to anyone at their own pace, while developing the power-packed punches and kicks for which they are are famous.",1188259200,6,340,4.862068965517241
2808486,5,B000P2A2XI,"I first saw the DVD workout by Tiffany and Max at my friend's house.  She was having so much fun that I wanted to give it a try.

Then I discovered how much fun working out with them that I got my own copy and a few as gifts.  When I gave a copy to a co-worker of mine who, like myself have a desk job, work very long and unpredictable hours which leaves him effete on a daily basis.  He was so happy after trying the workout first on his own, that he suggested we workout together.  We are now workout buddies and best friends.  We don't quite look like Tiffany and Max yet, but with their help, it is our goal to have ""knockout"" bodies like their's by the end of this year.",1185408000,4,675,3.962962962962963
2808487,5,B000P2A2XI,"William Chen should be very proud of his offspring.  They've come up with a system that's well thought out and exicuted.  They have bodies that we all aspire to and make it look easy.  The exercizes go from basic to challanging and the instruction increases in detail.  Tiffany's voice is soothing, encouraging and confident without being intimidating. The short appearance of Master Chen is inspiring.",1184803200,12,402,5.138461538461539
2808488,5,B000P2A2XI,"I just got this dvd thru netflix.  I like to preview before I buy.  Haven't done it yet.  So here are my comments. When I do it tomorrow, I'll add more:

Setting:  Boxing ring
Teachers: Max & Tiffany
DVD layout:  There is too brief stretch and an aerobic warm-up, ie boxers footwork that you would do with a jump rope.  As the previous reviewer said there are 3 20 minute workouts with increasing difficulty. If you have never taken ANY boxing or kickboxing classes before, do not buy this dvd because I don't think they spend enough time on technique.  I know the punches, and kicks from taking boxing classes at Crunch.  If you think, well I've done tae bo and I can do this.  This workout is much harder than tae bo, in a different way.

In addition to standard punches, there are round house kicks, knee kicks, exercises where you puunch, kick, hit the floor (sprawl) jump back up, switch legs and do it again.

Set 1 is 4 rounds of 3 exercises, 30 seconds each, except round 4 which is the hardest and most cardio intensive.  It is fast feet and sprawl about 6 times in a row with 30 second intervals between sets
Set 2 is 4 rounds of 4 exercises, 30 seconds each
Set 3 is 4 rounds of 4(?) exercises done at 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 1 reps whew!!

After each set the dvd automatically goes to the stretch exercises.

Max and Tiffany do the exercises at a fast pace.  Tiffany is in voiceover.  Max is barefoot, Tiffany wears boxing shoes. She tells you to go at your own pace.  The exercises do not match the music.  It appears that the music was added after the exercises were recorded, just as background music.

Production:  Camera work can be a little funky as it switches back between the two teachers in the middle of a move.  Otherwise the production is great.

Personalities:  This really doesn't matter to me, but I'll include it because some people care about that sort of thing.  Tiffany is quite serious.  Max doesn't say much.  Both are cut and fit.

When I actually do set 1.  I will write more.  UPDATE: I did workout 1 this morning and all I have to say is wow!!!!!!!!!! I sweated up a storm in the 20-25 minute set (including warm-up and cool down)  I was gasping for air.  I can't wait to do this again.  Tiffany keeps saying to go at your own pace and not to try to keep up with her and Max. You'll appreciate this advice.  This is so much better than tae bo because you don't have to listen to Billy Blanks!!!

If you like boxing or kickboxing and you know how to NOT hurt yourself, then get this dvd.",1184630400,44,2515,4.267515923566879
2808489,5,B000P2A2XI,"I just rec'd this last week and I can't stop doing it. It's great to add on to a weight workout due to the segments each being 20 minutes. I have been doing weight circuits out of a book that which take me about 45-50 minutes to complete and then I tack on a segment of this to round the workout out to just over an hour.

The production quality is excellent (as is with all Acacia productions I've ever purchased). I love the music on it. It's very different and I recognize some of it from Duncan Wong's Yogic Arts DVD.

I just love Tiffany (she's the is the one that instructs and works out with brother Max). Tiffany has a straightforward ....let's get down to business demeanor. She's really cool. I'd love to see more DVDs from her and Max.
They are both serious in this workout and if you put your ""all"" into it, you will get a good workout. Keep in mind that the cardio effect of this DVD is broken up a bit by going to the floor for different moves for the abs, pushups, etc. Therefore, it has more of an interval effect.

I have A LOT of kickbox and martial arts workouts and nothing compares to this. I really love it. You must try it. I've never written a review for a product on Amazon (and I buy a lot of exercise DVDs). I really hope they come out with more workouts, as this truly is in a class of it's own. Love it!!!",1184371200,73,1334,4.103448275862069

I've only done the ""basics"" portion so i don't know if this actually teaches Kung Fu Kickboxing but it is a great workout for anyone.

2808508,5,B000P2A2XI,I really really love this workout!  I never get bored with it and I like the fact that they don't over talk during it and they actually do the work out with you (Jillian Michaels).

2808523,2,B000P2A2XI,"The old Billy Blanks Basic Tae bo tape is harder than this and more fun.  I did the intermediate workout twice back to back and I still needed a workout.  I like the Chen's but they need to kick it up a notch.

I did the introductory and the intermediate before I abandoned it.  The video is too slow for me.

I am in reasonable shape.  I am capable of completing the Insanity Plyometric workout with some degree of difficulty if I pause from time to time to stave off cardiac arrest.  I would estimate my fitness level is slightly above average for a fella my age.

This is good for 30-40 something beginners and senior citizens.",1363737600,,630,4.3247863247863245
2808524,4,B000P2A2XI,"The workouts, while brief, are nice ""high intensity interval training"" sessions. I find the DVD great for a change up during P90X off-weeks. As no equipment is required, it's also handy while traveling.",1363219200,,202,5.151515151515151

2808526,3,B000P2A2XI,"This is not for the beginner.  And not for anyone who experiences back pain or leg pain.  It is a unique workout.  Some very unusual moves.  Not enough kicking practice.  I would recommend highly the Jeanette Jenkins Hollywood Kickboxing workout.  It is a fast, fun and rewarding workout.",1359244800,,288,4.895833333333333
2808527,5,B000P2A2XI,"I was a little skeptical at trying a DVD for instruction, but I am glad I did.  The workout is pretty intense but easy to follow.  I definately was cursing near the end, but that is a good thing!  I would definately tell others to purchase this :)",1346630400,2,247,4.104166666666667
2808528,5,B000P2A2XI,"I didn't expect much from this dvd, but I was delighted I made the purchase, from the warm up work out I was sweating, then I did the basic and for 20 mins i was dripping with sweat, I must say I love it, once I am sweating I know it is working, also my thighs were burning so yay, once it burning they say its working, so I am very glad I added this to my collection",1343865600,,367,3.717948717948718
2808529,5,B000P2A2XI,"I have been through intense cardio workouts at the gym but this was far better! The most important thing in a high intensity workout is to keep motivated and not set unattainable goals for yourself. The instruction was excellent in this DVD and that is important for safety and motivation. I did 17 minutes of The Basic for the first time and got my but whooped. However, it was so awesome because I have never worked that much in cardio before and was drenched in sweat (I love you CheetahDry clothing). I would highly recoomend this dvd for those who have trained for high intensity cardio and would warn the unprepared that you better be ready for the butt whooping of a lifetime. There is no choice except to buy this for those who want to get their heart pumping and foreheads dripping.",1341878400,2,791,4.538461538461538
2808530,5,B000P2A2XI,"I purchased this workout dvd from Amazon last fall, and I think it deserves a lot of credit for both its presentation and how it works your body. The circuit combinations seem to be perfectly balanced, leaving you just enough energy to complete each round.

First of all, it's not driven by vanity. I believe the ""beach body"" dvd's revolve around the ""look how good I look while wearing next to nothing"" philosophy. Instead, this dvd features two instructors who have a more soulful approach. You respect them because you know that they are fighters who've achieved their fitness level through respect, dignity, and restraint, not body physique obsession.

Forget about how good you look and what jeans you can fit into, and focus more on the internal rewards of working out. That is what this dvd offers that few others do. Thank you brother and sister for leaving room for dignity and virtue in a heart-pumping workout.",1332633600,7,921,4.822784810126582
2808531,5,B000P2A2XI,"I purchased this with the intention of adding variety to my DVD collection. I've practiced Kung Fu (Choi Li Fut style)  many years ago in China Town so I have to admit my expectation was that this DVD was going to be a more masculine version of Tae Bo...I was soooo wrong! These guys definitely know what they are doing. The drills are authentic just like when I was training and their technique is amazing.  I would say it is nearly impossible to learn any kind of martial art at home by yourself...you need a teacher, culture and tradition.  This DVD is perfect for people wanting to get into shape and/or join a martial art school and for existing students looking to reinforce what they have learned in class.  You will have no regrets with this purchase!! For the reviewer who suggested there were too many drills in this DVD...they clearly no nothing about martial arts...you have to build the foundation both mentally and physically before you move onto any other moves. I would spend 1-2 hours every 4 hour Kung Fu class in a horse stance ...and that was the norm.  Enjoy this ..cheerish this DVD...Im thinking about buying a backup just incase I wear the first one out in over usage.  THanks for making such a great product!!!",1330128000,3,1235,4.590909090909091
2808532,5,B000P2A2XI,"If you are using any sort of interval training program (P90X etc.), then I think you will really like this DVD.  I use the KFKBWO in place of P90x's Kenpo training day - it's WAY better.  No dis to Tony Horton (I LOVE P90X), but the Kenpo routine left me wanting more and Tiffany and Max's great DVD more than makes up for it.

A word of advice:  Give this DVD 3 solid sessions before you make your mind up on it.  When I first used it, I liked it, but it is a bit different than P90x.  Tiffany and Max are fighters and they train like fighters.  Their video is not in your face, there is no joking around and there are NO breaks.  Use the instruction sessions the first 2 times to get used to the moves.  I guarantee by the 3rd session you will LOVE it. The DVD has a definite rhythm and pace and if you get in sync with it, you will be soaked after a half hour.  When I do this video, I not only feel like I am doing something healthy and good for my body, I feel like I can also kick someone's butt - ha.  Can't wait for more videos from Tiffany and Max, this one is GREAT!",1329782400,5,1076,3.912442396313364
2808533,1,B000P2A2XI,"Bad filming, poor instruction.  I used this dvd one time and threw it away.  Didn't even bother trying to resell it because I knew it was not worth it to the person that would purchase it.",1318896000,,188,4.194444444444445
2808534,3,B000P2A2XI,"I put myself in the intermediate fitness level category.

Pros: Production value is very good.  Instructor(s) are great.  Straightforward and relaxed.  Tiffany narrates and has a nice lower range voice that is not annoying.  Worked up a good sweat.  Nice to see familiar moves throughout the workout (stretch, warmup, workout) coming from a martial arts background.  This is a pro for me but could be a con for beginners --- they have breakdown segments to show the moves but not a serious step by step how-to i.e., how to do a roundhouse kick or hook punch if you are a completely new to this kind of thing.  Worked up a moderate sweat for some of the harder moves.

Cons:  Would be good to be able to select segments to play in a row rather than having to keep selecting each segment to play.  This is a con for me but probably not for others --- While they do give alternatives for limited space, the more room you have, the better for some moves.  Unfortunately, I am working with an extremely limited space that barely fits maybe a couple large yoga mats.  While I worked up a sweat, I am looking for a little more intensity and burn.  Either the time has to go longer, tougher moves, or more of the tougher moves.  Preferably, all 3.

This is more of a traditional martial arts workout --- with kick/punch drills (no real emphasis on just kicking) and basic situps/pushups, no dance or step-tap-step keep-moving-moves --- rather than a kickbox workout as many cardio exercise videos present them so if you are looking for that you will be disappointed.  This workout is also more of a circuit workout (you're up punching, then down on the mat pushups, then up again) than strict cardio like the P90X kenpo so, again, if you want something like that, you will probably be disappointed.",1286755200,6,1790,4.596214511041009

2808536,5,B000P2A2XI,"the video is sometimes strange to watch.  I do not like how each movement transition happens off screen.  This makes it difficult to get into the proper position, when you are starting out and do not remember what each exercise is.  However, the DVD has it where it counts, a good work out.  At only 20 mins a session, it's very easy to find time.  And for that little amount of time, it does a very efficient job at working out your whole body, even your neck, which was entirely new to me.",1268870400,4,491,4.236559139784946
2808537,5,B000P2A2XI,"This dvd includes 3 workouts; beginner, intermediate, advanced all 20 minutes. I like this set because the workouts are 20 minutes ideal when I'm limited on time. I get a good sweat out of all the workouts even the easy one. If your looking for a good workout in short time this workout is worth the price.",1266624000,,306,4.385964912280702
2808538,5,B000P2A2XI,"I am very impressed with this workout's simplicity, yet in-depth exercises that can leave you gasping. I am into Tai-Chi and love to mix up the mild slow movements of Tai Chi with the energetic pulse pumping Kickboxing Workout.
I have been doing Tiffany/Max Chen's work out for about six weeks and people are already complimenting me on my my broader shoulders. I am flattered, but that's only one of the workout's benefits. One feels stronger and faster very quickly.
The workout is divided into three workouts, each one more taxing that the previous workout. Exercises are run in 30 second increments and nothing is really technically difficult.
This program -- has something to offer any level of Kick boxing, Kung Fu and really just a good aerobic workout something challenging. I highly recomend it. Tiffany and her brother Max hold more than 200 gold medals in Tai Chi and Kick boxing between them and the workouts deserve one too.",1266537600,4,937,4.8625
2808539,5,B000P2A2XI,This was my first workout DVD.  I am getting a great workout from just the first 20 min segment and look forward to adding on the rest.  I have been doing the stationary cycle and simple arm exercises for a few months before starting this and am glad I warmed up a bit.  If you live in an apartment or have people living under you this video is alot of fun...Not all the moves are easy to keep quiet and what I do is either improvise a softer move based on what their doing or go really slow and try to improve coordination..So don't be disappointed if you can't do all the moves at first in your w/o area.  Other than that I love the tone of the actors: intense on focus and strength but easy going and encouraging in a soft insightful way rather than barky or cheesy cheer stuff I have seen in other videos.  A great choice.,1261353600,,826,4.1375
2808550,5,B000P2A2XI,"This is one of the best kockbox workouts that I own, specifically because it gets into other areas of martial arts training.

Add a weighted vest for an excellent, serious martial arts training workout.",1255651200,2,368,4.857142857142857
2808551,5,B000P2A2XI,"First, for those who suspect that 5-star reviews are coming from friends of the Chens, let me state that this is my first time ever hearing of the Chens. They are in NYC and I am in California. I just purchased this DVD on sale at Borders, and must say I am quite impressed.

Now--If you are looking for a bouncy, ""TaeBo""-like or aerobic class type of work out--this is not the DVD for you. Go buy TaeBo or one of the other classlike workouts. If, however, you want a serious kickbox workout--check this one out. WARNING: THIS DVD CONTAINS NO FLUFF, NO FRILLS, AND NO JOKES, just kickboxing drills that will give you a killer, full body workout combining core, strength, and cardio moves. It is well balanced and presented with proper form.

I practiced Kajukenbo and kickboxing for several years. This DVD makes me feel right at home and is much less annoying than some of the videos by instructors who have never set foot in a dojo in their lives. You can definitely see and feel the difference. Billy Blanks is a martial artist, so if that is the style you like, go for it. Personally, I love this DVD as it works me--just like in the good old days back in the dojo.",1238803200,13,1169,4.382488479262673
2808552,5,B000P2A2XI,"I got this video in January, and have been working it into my rotation for almost 2 months.  It's a good short work-out -- each of the 3 sets is 15 minutes of actual exercise, plus some short voice-over transitions, plus warm-up and cool-down stretching (comes close to 20 minutes).  If you want to really get at least 20 minutes of solid burn in, you probably will want to supplement with 5 minutes of extra jumping jacks or aerobics.  This being said, though, this is not really a beginner's exercise video, the burn is fairly intense, and I suspect that most people who like this video will be using it to supplement other types of physical training as well (weight lifting, running, etc.)

Others have talked about the three kick-boxing work-outs in detail.  All of them are a good burn and involve some strength elements, although I find the third (""The Killer"") to be most aerobically demanding.  In my opinion, the biggest difference across the three work-outs is not so much the intensity level, but the complexity of the moves.  The first work-out (""The Basics"") involves only one move at a time -- jumping front kicks may initially be difficult for your endurance or balance, but it's not hard to understand what the instructors are asking you to do.  By the third work-out (""The Killer""), they are having you do 4 or 5 boxing moves in sequenence (e.g., hook, cross, round-house kick, side kick).  Beyond being aerobically challenging, it takes time to learn these sequences, so you can do them without having to think about it.

The one other thing I'd point out is that this video does have a bit of the feel of fight training to it.  They make you do neck exercises, for example -- you certainly won't find that on a typical aerobics video.  Although they do not teach you any complicated kung fu forms, they do expect you already to know the basics of how to do a decent round-house kick, or a thrusting side kick, for example.  They do not coach you on proper form for these kinds of moves -- I guess you can pick them up on the fly, but it's certainly easier to do this video if you've had any martial arts training at all in the past.  (I'm almost 20 years past taking such classes, but even so, it was enough for me to feel reasonably comfortable getting back into kicking form.)",1235433600,9,2297,4.543689320388349
2808553,5,B000P2A2XI,"It's been a great workout for us; definitely challenging, but it's already working after just a few weeks. And it's a lot easier to stick with then something boring like yoga or step aerobics. Most importantly, it's quick, 30 minutes from warm up to cool down.

The first workout is suitable for a pretty small apartment, two of us are able to do it at the same time pretty comfortably in a fairly small living room. Haven't made it to work outs two or three, yet, but it looks like they might require a bit more space.",1233964800,,519,4.350515463917525
2808554,2,B000P2A2XI,"After having actually worked out to people like Billy Blanks' Tae Bo and another kickboxing DVD I was looking to switch things up.  So disappointed that this mainly focuses on training for actual matches instead of kickboxing to music which is what I expected.  The ""headups"" in the first segment...just annoying.  The ""crab crawls"" in the second or third segment...for what?  If you're used to Tae Bo or Cathe Freidrech's Kick Max...skip this DVD.",1227916800,6,448,5.013513513513513
2808555,4,B000P2A2XI,"I am glad this DVD is not a kickboxing aerobic workout.

That being said, this DVD may not help you workout to the point where you will break a sweat.

But, what it will do is help you develop overall, coordination, GPP (general physical preparedness) and provide a means to have a great short workout, when you are crunched on time.

This DVD will get you moving.  People with neck injuries I would say to skip the neck exercises and substitute with something else, shoulder shrugs, arm swings, etc.

Tiffany and Max Chen are good instructors, the set is pleasant and music is very much in the background.

I plan to add this as an extra work out on my recovery days, when I do not feel like going full force, but want to still move around.",1225756800,,741,4.372262773722627

The most advanced 20-min workout on the DVD is aptly titled ""The Killer"" and I am not quite there yet because it takes practice, but I am drenched with sweat after the intermediate workout (""The Kicker""). This is a perfect workout on ""cardio days"" if you like to lift weights as well as do cardio. It will really kick your butt, no matter what your fitness level is. VERY creative, good instruction throughout, great teachers with tons of credentials and super likeable personalities, good background music (not annoying techno, which unfortunately some of my other faves have).",1221264000,3,779,4.735294117647059
2808557,4,B000P2A2XI,"I have kickboxed competitively and I appreciated the legitimacy of the exercises and what they could do for you, whether you want to learn real fighting moves and technique or just want an effective workout. Since my husband and I also worked as film crew on another unrelated workout DVD that was high in quality and aesthetics, as well as a good workout, we were buying this for comparison's sake. We were pleased with the quality of this DVD, the Chens' explanations and tips, the pacing, and the options for choosing the level of difficulty of the workout. It is visually appealing, and feels comfortable and intimate, like you are there having a workout with friends introducing you to their sport. These are likable people, experts in their sport, and very good at guiding you through a workout that may be foreign to you at first. This is better than a typical gym kickboxing workout geared towards people who will never go into martial arts, without being scary or too hardcore for that same audience. It works for people already in martial arts, and beginners as well. Way to go Max! I knew you could fight like the Mad Dog you are, I have seen plenty of your matches, but this really impressed me on a different level!

2808558,2,B000P2A2XI,"I really wanted to like this dvd. This is put out by the kids of William Chen, a famous Tai Chi boxer from Taiwan. For those unfamiliar with real Tai Chi, and have seen the slow dance that is better known, Tai Chi is a boxing method that often places in the bare knuckle matches that were common in Taiwan.
This dvd however is disjointed and lacks focus. Voice over is hard to hear and the breaks in the routine seem odd. I was expecting much more in terms of techniques given the lineage of the creators and more from the dvd technically. A lot of dvds now offer the ability to customize workouts, etc. and given the hip look of teh dvd (which is good) I just expected more.
As far as all the five star reviews...I think that there is some 'viral' marketing at work. Hint: beware of 5 star reviews and...when you click on 'see all my reviews' you realize that this person has only reviewed once on Amazon. Mind you I don't post...I just felt the need as I was underwhelmed by this dvd.",1219449600,6,986,4.25

2808570,4,B000P2A2XI,"This is great exercise. I am in reasonably good shape and the first two workouts always leaves me exhausted. This is great for learning kickboxing at home.

Having said that I will not give them a 5 star rating simply because the production qualities are poor. Max Chen's voice is inaudible. The biggest challenge is that the tempo in the thrird workout is so fast that I can never follow along with the DVD. I really have to pause the DVD at the instruction stage and follow the routine of 8,6,4,2 reps on my own. That takes away the fun of working out along with the instructors.",1212624000,,581,4.429906542056075
2808571,5,B000P2A2XI,"This DVD does a good job of covering most of your muscle groups.  The two main workouts (The Kicker and The Killer) are pretty intense, and definitely keep your heart rate up.

The Kicker
This workout has a number of exercises in 30 second increments, with little to no rest between them.  This is very good for keeping your heart rate up.  Basically, these are calisthenics for kickboxers.  The first time I did this workout, having done Tae Bo and a few Yoga/Martial Arts videos, I had a tough time.  I finished, but had to take a 60 second break.

The Killer
This workout is a series of kickboxing exercises (punches, kicks, etc.).  First you do 10 reps, then repeat the whole set with 8 reps, then 6, 4, and finally 2 reps.  I was unable to get through this workout non-stop until the 3rd attempt.

I typically do several exercises per week (usually, 2 per day), with both of these workouts being part of the rotation.  Today, I did the Killer workout, followed by 30 minutes of weights and core.  On other days, I do inline skating, long distance biking, trail biking, jogging, or Yoga.  I've used this system to slim down quite a bit (30 pounds and 4 inches).  However, even more important (for me) was the added stamina.  The biking and the Killer workout are the two that push me the hardest.

I recommend this video for anyone who is is reasonable shape looking to improve.  This is not a video for beginners.  Warm up and stretch before this workout are critical, to avoid injury.",1211500800,11,1490,4.496268656716418

I feel the kettle bells have improved both my strength and cardio-vascular capacity a lot.  However, I find these workouts can be a little tough on your lower back if you are not careful.  Also, I don't like to lug around a 25 pound kettle bell when I travel, so I am always looking for other videos that don't need any equipment and work the whole body.

 I like this DVD very much.  It works out muscles that don't get worked with my other videos, and the production values are the best I have seen in an exercise video yet. Good music, cool B&W scenes of Max and Tiffany between rounds,and an attractive dimly-lit boxing ring get you in the mood for a good workout. You can't argue with the street cred of this pair; both are very accomplished in san shou.  Tiffany has a very encouraging coaching style, and is fun to look at, too. Max doesn't talk much, and doesn't need to:  he just looks really, really strong.  My only complaint is that they don't tell you if you are supposed to do just one workout (of the three), or combine them. Also, do they supplement this workout with other stuff on the off days?

  I hope they put out more videos.

2808573,2,B000P2A2XI,This is my first time writing reviews. I am just so disapointed with this product. I feel the 5 star reviews were given by friends. The workout as stated by a reviewer before is mostly a bunch of drills of situps and pushups etc.. totally not a kickboxing routine!,1206921600,6,264,4.408163265306122
2808574,5,B000P2A2XI,"I love this workout, as the three 20 minute segments allow it to be easily added on to other workouts or to combine all three for a great complete workout.

As a martial artist, I love the authenticity and practicality of the moves--I can actually apply the drills and training to my martial arts practice--it's not just aerobics and kickboxing. The pair also choose drills I would never do on my own, but target muscles/skills I definitely need--like neck and balance exercises.

Taken alone, each 20 minute segment is a little too easy for me, so I usually combine at least two for a more intense workout.  The stretching is also very short, so I usually add on at least five minutes before starting the workout.  I also change the technique on some of the kicks to match my style of martial arts--but the workouts easily allow you to do so.",1200700800,3,843,4.562913907284768
2808575,3,B000P2A2XI,"I bought this one based upon all of the 5 star reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, it's just not for me.

There are a LOT of variations on pushups (which I am Not a fan of) and quite a bit of plyo (also not a fan).  I was really hoping for a bit more kickboxing type drills (a la P90X Kenpo X) but this workout seems to be mainly drills, drills, drills of all kinds!

Tiffany seems to be a bit stiff and self-conscious in this workout, and there's no mirror cueing unfortunately.  Also, I don't recall hearing any music while doing the drills.

I'm sure this workout is great for building up strength and endurance for better kickboxing, but I didn't find the workout to have any kind of a ""fun"" factor (like Turbo Jam, my personal fav).  If it ain't fun, I just won't do the workout.

If you're looking for high intensity drills/plyos and you don't mind the high impact (or lots of pushups/variations on pushups), then this is the workout for you.

If you like low impact kickboxing with a fun factor and a decent musical beat to workout by, I don't recommend this one.",1197936000,48,1069,4.358585858585859
2808576,5,B000P2A2XI,"I am not a fan of aerobics and most kickboxing workouts , but I do like this one , this is not a choreographed aerobic workout disguised with kickboxing moves ,this is a real kickboxer's workout with different drills and exercises and you don't have to remember complicated moves , but you do need some stamina and core strength as these workouts are tough! there are 3 20 minute workouts in different levels but you can do 2 or all of them together if you'd like  ,there's a short warm up segment and a stretch segment. Honestly I found the ""the basics"" workout harder than ""the kicker"" probably because it is more cardio intensive than the second one which is mainly different exercises that requires more muscle strength (like alligator pushups)now I do both of them together. I haven't tried ""The Killer"" yet , but I can't wait to try it soon. The production quality is excellent like all other Acacia DVD's. Highly recommended.",1196899200,24,932,4.682926829268292

I love the fact that its broken into different segments so you can choose which workout suits you best. I did their workout two days ago and my muscle is still sore (in a good way!) I also like the way how Tiffany encourages you even when you feel like giving up mid-way cos its so tough. I've taken martial arts before and I can say that some of the moves are new to me. Definitely a good purchase!,1196035200,2,550,3.963963963963964
2808579,5,B000P2A2XI,"This is a really great workout.  I try run 3+ miles at least 3 times a week and occasionally do TaeBo on my 'off days'.  As I am a fair-weather runner, I was looking for a new aerobic activity that I could do during cold or inclement weather.  I found it!  In fact, I may never have to run again! Within 10 minutes I had broken the sweat that usually doesn't start until I begin mile 2 during my run.  After the stretching and warm-up, there are three 20 minute workouts.  So far I've only completed first one: The Basics.  I will probably stick to this one until I'm moving through it more easily.  I like how the exercises are broken down into intervals.  You do one exercise for 30 seconds, move to the second exercise of the round, then repeat each 2 more times.  I've always hated exercises that just leave you hanging there, burning one single muscle for a ridiculous amount of time such as Billy Blanks does this in TaeBo with his floor exercises.  He leaves you there repeating the same movement while he's walking around telling you he's watching you and you'd better not quit.  That's the point I normally turn it off.  Anyway, if you enjoy working out and are looking for something new, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.  If the 20 minute workout time isn't enough for you and you're serious about getting 30-50 minutes of activity during your workout, it's a great appetizer to a yoga session.

I bought this because I was impressed by the instructors' background - the sister in Tai Chi push-hands and the brother in San Shou. I was looking for exercises to help make my movements more circular (very important in Kung Fu), help set me up for acrobatic moves like tornado-style jump kicks, or help me with quicker footwork and safer weight shifting. I'm disappointed that I wasn't seeing any Kung Fu moves, Kung-Fu inspired moves or  moves that are designed for helping you perform Kung Fu moves.

You may not find this workout as exhausting as I did. That said, Ten minutes into the basic workout on this video and I was huffing and puffing and had to get my sweatband. Plus there are two more levels increasing in intensity as you become more fit. They take you through a ""watch and Learn"" phase before the workout where they explain what the exercises will be and how they are done. The workouts are set up like boxing rounds with 30 seconds each of two exercise followed by 30 seconds rest. Once you do three sets you go to the next two exercises and repeat the 30 second reps and rest. Everything is explained and presented well. It had my muscles sore in areas that my weight work and jogging don't hit. I am very happy with this video.
