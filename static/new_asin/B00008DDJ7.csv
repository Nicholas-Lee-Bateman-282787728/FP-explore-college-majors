1834644,3,B00008DDJ7,"Cardio Sculpt Blaster is part of the new generation FIRM tapes.  I've been using FIRM videos since the 80's and although I give the FIRM creators snaps for innovative ideas these new tapes just don't bust my butt like the old tapes do.  Cardio Sculpt Blaster is an enjoyable quick workout, but I barely break a sweat.  I'll only recommend this workout if you don't have time to do anything else.  It's only 30 minutes, but it's better than doing nothing. For a killer sweat fest I recommend FIRM tape number one, ""Body Sculpting Basics with Susan Harris"".  My all time favorite butt kicker!!!",1066694400,4,592,4.653846153846154
1834645,4,B00008DDJ7,I love this tape.  I found the choreography easy to follow after the second time. The music isn't bad and I find the instructor motivating.  I like to pair it with an ab tape or an upper body workout.,1061856000,2,200,4.102564102564102
1834646,1,B00008DDJ7,"The early Firm Videos were extraordinarily well done.  This one does not live up to the past excellence of this company.  Cutsey high coordination dance moves may look good being done by women who've taken dance classes but leave me frustrated and angry (I've done aerobics class for over fifteen years this sort of cutsey stuff is NOT NECESSARY) Give me a DVD that proveds a startup menu allowing me to bypass all the slow screen credits for the producer, director, photographer etc. etc etc. this was a deal killer and I returned the DVD for a credit.",1057449600,7,553,4.63265306122449

There are a few moves to learn, but once you learn them, you'll get an excellent workout.  Plus, you can heavy up on the weights (within reason, of course...nothing TOO heavy) to increase the intensity when you're ready.

1834648,3,B00008DDJ7,"I didn't much like this exercise video.  I should preface that by saying that the reason why I didn't like it is that I'm not the most coordinated person.  I found the step moves to be complicated and annoying.  I didn't get my heart rate up because I was constantly trying to figure out how to complete the moves.  I have some other videos that use a step but none of them are this annoying.  I was expecting a program that would allow me to use the ""fanny firmer"" to pinpoint certain problem areas but I didn't expect the video to be mostly used with the step.  I have several The Firm videos but none this annoying.  If you are good at the step, this also might not be good for you because it doesn't really seem to get the heart rate up, even if you knew all the moves.  Based on this experience, I won't purchase any other programs where a step is in use.",1056067200,5,860,4.13855421686747

At first I was so disappointed by this DVD, but once I got all the steps done, this became one of my favorite DVD's to workout to. I loved it so much, that I purchased the DVD.
Give yourself time to learn the steps and it will for sure become one of your favorite workouts to go to. Short and sweet but gets the work done.

********1st Review**********
I bought this tape because I love the Firm tapes I own, the older ones.
This tape was a major disappointment for me. I did not get a sweat out of this tape but, at the same time I could not follow through with them.  They go from one step to another, as if you rehearsed each step with them for six weeks before the shot the tape.
I was totally uncoordinated.  They were doing one step, then another, and another, and I was still trying to figure out the first step. Doing this workout I felt like a chicken with my head cut off.
I will just stick with their streingth training tapes. Those are awesome, and they really do tone you!
For cardio, I would recommend the one hour Tae-Bo's. They are easier to follow. You work out a heavy sweat and he actually explains each step before going to another.",1055030400,8,1160,4.216216216216216
1834650,2,B00008DDJ7,"i found this tape to be very easy. It did not raise my heart
to my target heart rate at all i didn;t even break a sweat i tried it again raising the fanny lifter to 8 inches still not a over all challanging workout. I still pefer the older firm tapes to the newer ones. They are more effective  i find. Since
anna benson has started her own tapes fitprime i find the firm has lost there edge. Anna Benson is the creator of the firm workouts pre 2001.",1054598400,4,450,4.0
1834651,4,B00008DDJ7,If you are short on time and want a good workout then you'll love this workout. Lisa keeps it interesting and the segments aren't long ones. They go from one right into a different sequence keeping it from getting boring. Before you know it the workout is over and your done. Good workout in a short amount of time(30 min.),1054080000,3,323,4.4

1834654,5,B00008DDJ7,Just got through another 30 minute work out - It's easy  to follow and is time efficient!!  Love all my DVDs from the FIRM,1399334400,,122,4.041666666666667
1834655,3,B00008DDJ7,"Typical Firm workout.  I like the 30 minute compact version, but the cueing is sometimes iffy making it hard to keep up the first couple of times.",1383868800,,146,4.407407407407407
1834656,4,B00008DDJ7,"I have been wanting to purchase the add-on workouts from the BSS1 series for some time, and tI purchased this one along with The Firm - Body Sculpting System: Super Body Sculpt (led by Stephanie Corley).

I like Lisa Kay as an instructor.  She is very upbeat, and her cueing was spot on!  I am beginning exercising again after having been away from it for some time, and found this workout's pace to be perfect.  It was challenging without being too strenuous.  And while I don't have the Fanny Lifter, I do own the TransFirmer (the elongated two-part step featured in the BSS4 series) and found that it worked just fine.

This really is a great cardio workout that is very short in duration (around a mere 30 minutes), so the time literally flies by and the workout is over before you know it.",1377216000,3,794,4.479166666666667
1834657,5,B00008DDJ7,I absolutely love the older Firm workouts so this one is a blast for me to do. The older ones seem to work me harder and I enjoy that.  I highly recommend this product.,1375142400,,168,3.9411764705882355
1834658,1,B00008DDJ7,"I'll start by saying that I love the FIRM workouts.  I own dozens and I do them religiously.  I work out 5 or 6 days every week to a rotation of FIRM videos. I've had this one for a while, but have only recently done it.  I was looking for a shorter workout, which this is at about 30 minutes, and I chose this one since I'd never done it.  Well, when I was done, I didn't feel like I'd worked out AT ALL.  The moves were easy ~ I guess because I've done step aerobics and FIRM videos for quite some time now.  I barely even broke a sweat. I really like Lisa Kay as an instructor and she's as good (as always) in this video.  It's just the workout itself that I'm disappointed in.  It is definitely a beginner workout.  I really don't see myself pulling this one out again.  I have other short workouts that actually have me sweating and feeling like I've worked out after doing them.  Beginners should go for this one.",1373241600,,919,4.135593220338983
1834659,5,B00008DDJ7,"I actually disliked this workout very much at first!  The moves were quite complicated.  I gave it a 2nd try, and it was much, much easier.  I am thinking it will just get better.  It is a great workout when you are pressed for time.  It is about 30-35 minutes.  If you do a lot of the workouts in this series with the blue/purple fanny lifter, they are all similar.  I think it helps to do the series together.  Also, if you are finding the stepwork hard, just do the step work without adding the arms.  Once you learn the step routine, add the arms.  I find this helps a lot. Don't judge this workout to quickly....it just gets better and better!  I actually am looking forward to doing it again and mastering it in the future.",1368835200,2,729,4.248175182481752
1834660,2,B00008DDJ7,"If you are an owner of the fanny lifter and hoping to find another good workout DVD this is not the one.  Although I really like Lisa Kay's style, I was hoping for more of a work-out.  The video is a little more than 30 minutes and almost all cardio.  There are a couple of times where you use light weights for arm movements, but there is no sculpting for the lower body.  Also, expect to do the workout a few times before you familiarize yourself with the moves.  It is hard to get your heart rate up before you know the steps.  It does use the fanny lifter but a chair and a normal step would work just as well.",1357689600,2,614,4.033057851239669
1834661,5,B00008DDJ7,"I have this on VHS, but got tired of rewinding it, so I ordered the DVD. It is a short but concentrated workout that works you from head to toe. Not too hard, not too easy. To make it easy, just use the purple box. To make it harder, use the blue box and heavier weights. You won't outgrow it.",1312848000,,293,3.9
1834667,4,B00008DDJ7,"I have quite a few FIRM VHS and DVD workouts.  I like this one because it makes your mind work too, BUT if you are use to doing regular step workouts with a large step - be careful with this one.  I fell off or tripped over the purple part of the Fanny Lifter twice the first time I did this workout and then I was too nervous about falling to really get a good workout.  But when I tried it with one of my regular steps though it was just fine.  Just passing this along with the hopes that it might help someone else enjoy this workout.",1265500800,,537,3.9444444444444446
1834668,5,B00008DDJ7,"After noticing a friend shedding pounds every month I asked her for the secret. She said she is using the firm workouts 3-4 times a week. From her recommendations I have bought the Cardio Overdrive dvd from the Firm, overly optimistic to see similar results. Well...not what took place. After pressing the ""play"" button I was lost from the first 5 minutes of the exercise. The moves too fast and just seemed I could never get the moves, being that I am rhythm-less person. Needless to say I got so discouraged that I just gave up on it and for a whole year just forgot about the Dvd. It was just recently that randomly I found this particular DVD at an amazing discount, and decided to buy it and give The Firm another chance. I found this workout challenging and felt that with just a bit of perseveration I could learn the steps. After using the tape about 5 times I can say that not only I learned the moves but like I said before I absolutelly love it. It gives a great workout and one would definitely work a sweat within the half an hour. It is because of this DVD that I decided to give The Firm another chance and just bought other workouts in the hope that they will resemble this DVD.
I see some mixed reviews here for this Dvd and I can only conclude that each workout is perceived different from person to person. My friend recommending me the Cardio Overdrive absolutely loved it, it was her favorite and she does have an extensive Firm videos library, however that workout DVD was just not for me.

My advice do not get discouraged by some negative reviews when choosing a workout DVD, each person is entitled to personal opinions and each person is different.

If you find the pace a bit to fast don't get discouraged. First time I tried to follow this workout I'm pretty sure I looked ridiculous trying to mirror the movements and steps meanwhile doing it all wrong. It's perfectly ok not to be able to follow the instructors the first time around, but trust me after working out from this DVD 3 times you will be almost a pro.",1262736000,,2043,4.402116402116402
1834669,4,B00008DDJ7,"I bought this way back when it first came out. It's a thirty-minute cardio workout, alternating low- and high-impact floor aerobics, four-limb moves with light dumbbells & step routines (both with & without dumbbells). The whole workout is nicely balanced between those various cardio styles, the moves are pretty easy to learn while still being non-monotonous, and the clean, bright set enhances the uplifting aspect of the workout. I wish the musical track was a little bit louder, compared to her speaking voice, but it's not too big of a deal. As with virtually all FIRM workouts, the moves are precisely timed to the music, which is all non-vocal, and fairly motivating. While Lisa Kay is not my favorite instructor of all time, she does a good job here. She's actually pretty pleasent here (she seems kind of snobby in some other workouts), and manages to make this workout go by really fast. It's a nice workout to add on to a short weight-training workout, once you become more advanced, too. It's the easiest & shortest cardio workout that I've seen The Firm make, and I've viewed all of their workouts made from 1985-2005.

This is the cardio workout that I most often turn to when I'm low on motivation, just getting over an illness, need a lighter cardio day because I worked hard with weights the day before, or when my knees are not up for a complex routine. The step routines are performed on a 6"" platform by their ""beginner"" exerciser, and 8"" by the other exercisers/instructor. If you own a 4"" step platform, then the exercises would certainly work on that, too. Personally, I prefer to do step aerobics on a 4"" platform, as balance & cardio speed/endurance aren't my strong suit. It's still working my heart, no doubt, but it's easier on the knees & back than most workout DVD's, and as I've aged, this means a lot to me. A step shaped like a box is what they use here, but a Transfirmer or Reebox Step can be used instead- just turn it to the side, so you're facing the shorter edge, not the full-length side of the step. There is no abdominal work, there are no lunges, and you won't need to get on the floor at all- important if you're recovering from knee or back issues, I know. The step can be eliminated entirely, with the moves done as a floor aerobic routine instead, if you are a beginner and/or have serious joint issues. There is one segment where you'll do toe touches on a high step (14"" is what they use), but you won't actually have to climb the high step at all. You can always just touch your toes out in front of you, or on a lower step, if the high step is still too much of a challenge. Your arms & legs will get a light-to-medium workout from the DVD, especially once you add dumbbells- but it won't take the place of regular weight-training. A beginner should do the workout without weights at least the first time, just to make sure you get the routine down. But if you exercise regularly, you'll quickly progress into wanting dumbbells for the arm moves, as you'll need them to get the most from the workout cardiovascularly. I've used 8lb. dumbbells, at the most, and for a cardio workout, that's about as high as I'd really even want to go (for joint safety purposes, as much as anything else). The stretch at the end feels good, runs just the right length of time after such a workout, and finishes this off well.

This workout is perfect for those just getting into (or getting back into) a workout program. I won't say it's easy on an absolute beginner who is also out-of-shape, but it's manageable & wouldn't be as intimidating as some longer, tougher workouts can be. The intermediate exerciser may prefer to combine this with another half-hour or forty-five minute workout for further results & more of a challenge, and advanced exercisers may find this workout just too simple for their liking. You can, of course, up the step height, up the dumbbell weight, and do more high-impact as opposed to low as you progress. But the choreography is basic- if you like really complex, dance-y routines, this workout may get on your nerves. My other favorite Firm cardio workouts are Super Cardio Sculpt, Fat Blaster & Super Cardio.",1260057600,4,4176,4.596514745308311
1834670,4,B00008DDJ7,"I was kind of curious what The Firm Cardio videos had to offer. I bought this one as an afterthought, to go with the Cardio Inferno. This one has a lot of mild techniques, but gets the muscles warmed up pretty good. I don't sweat as much with this one as the Infirno.
I'm quick to pick up on the techniques, but also have to slow down at times to get the right form down. These videos are more my pace than anything I've seen in a long time. I've been stuck on one Pilate's video for many years. This is just the switch up I needed for the season.",1249516800,,547,3.981818181818182
1834671,2,B00008DDJ7,"I purchased this dvd in the store and am sadly disappointed.  I had read so many good things about Firm workouts.  I guess if you're familiar with their moves, etc, you'll like this workout.  I'm not--and the instructor went so fast that it was impossible for me to catch on and keep up.  I've done many workouts over the years and have rarely had a problem getting into the routine.  This was an exception.  Wish I could return this product.",1247443200,,442,4.4625
1834672,3,B00008DDJ7,"I am a huge FIRM fan and workout for 40-45 minutes 6-7 mornings a week. All of my videos are from the FIRM series. They feature safe exercises with a efficient and effective warm-up/cool-down segments. The DVDs help me to work out in my target heart rate range. I don't love all of the FIRM videos, though. Some are too fast or too slow. I am a woman who is 5' 9"" and 180 lbs. My heart rate for weight loss/weight maintenance is 120 to 135 beats per minute during the main workout time -- so I try to pick videos that work at that level. My favorite FIRM'videos are: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout, Burn & Shape and Total Body Toner.

This ""Cardio Sculpt Blaster"" is a little too intense for me -- it brings my heart rate up to the 135-140 range which is anaerobic for me. And the workout is only 30 minutes, so there's not enough warm-up and cool-down for my liking. I do like that it uses the Fanny Lifter, which I have and want to use. But the intensity is not right for me and my weight loss/weight maintenance goals. I still workout to this occasionally for variation from my other DVDs, though. So it's not a total loss.",1223337600,,1124,4.252336448598131

1834675,5,B00008DDJ7,I thought this was a pretty good workout for such a short amount of time. I worked up a good sweat too. I think people who do this and don't sweat AT ALL may not be putting a lot of energy into it. Even if the most advanced athletes did something as simple as power-walking for 30 minutes would sweat. But anyway... I think this is a good Firm workout to add to your collection. I don't have a background in dance and I found the steps relatively easy to follow. Usually by the 2nd time doing a tape I know all of the steps. I'd recommend this one!,1187136000,,548,4.036697247706422
1834676,4,B00008DDJ7,"I would have given this great, short cardio workout 5 stars if it wasn't among the workouts in the era that The Firm seemed determined to save us from boredom by making the stepping so complicated it takes many attempts to get the footwork down.

Once I got through the lengthy learning process, the workout has become a regular in my rotation.  With a 34 minute length, you can do it on days you've done a weight workout.  This is one of the few Firm DVD's that doesn't use heavy weights for a complete aerobic weight training workout.  Instead, they recommend 3-5 pound weights for advanced for one section and no more than 3 pounds in another - and some segments use no weights at all.  If you're accustomed to using heavy weights, the 3-5 pound weights and their use in this video wouldn't really qualify for sculpting, but adds to the intensity of the cardio workout.",1185148800,,872,4.528662420382165
1834677,4,B00008DDJ7,"This is an early 2000s Firm video from the series that uses the Fanny Lifter, a tall, square step which is adjustable to three heights.  This unique piece of equipment is effectively used here to provide a short, fun, intense cardio workout.  In addition to the Fanny Lifter (FL), light weights are occasionally added for 4-limbed work, but this is a pure cardio routine with no toning intervals.

Instructor Lisa Kay, who leads a class of 4 other Firm instructors, begins with a basic 4-minute warm-up which combines aerobic moves with dynamic stretches.  The first aerobics segment is performed without the step.  It moves somewhat slowly, with heel digs and back rocks, but my heart rate still got up, especially with the addition of small optional hops.  The first step aerobics portion with weights was a lot of fun, combining heel digs and rocks on and off the short portion of the FL with bicep curls.  Other combos included straddles with upright rows and rear dips.  There was some take it from the top here, but not so much that I found it annoying or overly repetitive.  Squats with hammer curls on the floor conclude this segment.

More step work follows, this time without the weights.  This segment was also fun and included A-steps, hamstring curls, knee lifts, L-steps, and floor jacks.  The next segment is mostly on the floor, but you add taps onto the fully assembled FL.  Here you get a bit more toning work with squats and overhead presses, but you are still moving at an aerobic pace.  Another fun aerobic step series follows, this time with straddles, side leg lifts, squats with 1 leg on the step, and presses onto the step.  This section was also a bit easier to follow than the first step tune.  The final aerobics segment consists of more 4-limb work, with grapevines/rhomboid pinch, step touch/bicep curls, and step knee (adding in a step onto the FL).  The almost 6-minute cool down consisted of many typical Firm moves, including marches, step-touch, hamstring curls, sambas, tri-star, and arm sweeps; a brief stretch series using the FL concludes the workout.

Overall, I enjoyed this short cardio workout, which comes in at just under 30 minutes total.  I found that my HR stayed in my target zone for a good portion of the time (22-23 minutes), plus I enjoyed the moves and was generally able to follow along.  Although this is a cardio-only workout, which is what I wanted, I still would've liked to have seen a set or two of the Firm's signature leg press move; it seems a shame not to use the FL for this.  Still, this is a very solid, enjoyable intermediate-level cardio workout that I'd definitely recommend, particularly for when you are short on time.

The final aerobics segment consists of more 4-limb work, with grapevines/rhomboid pinch, step touch/bicep curls, and step knee (adding in a step onto the FL).  The almost 6-minute cool down consisted of many typical Firm moves, including marches, step-touch, hamstring curls, sambas, tri-star, and arm sweeps; a brief stretch series using the FL concludes the workout.

Overall, I enjoyed this short cardio workout, which comes in at just under 30 minutes total.  I found that my HR stayed in my target zone for a good portion of the time (22-23 minutes), plus I enjoyed the moves and was generally able to follow along.  Although this is a cardio-only workout, which is what I wanted, I still would've liked to have seen a set or two of the Firm's signature leg press move; it seems a shame not to use the FL for this.  Still, this is a very solid, enjoyable intermediate-level cardio workout that I'd definitely recommend, particularly for when you are short on time.

Note:  this same Firm workout was released with at least three different covers, so be careful that you don't already own it when ordering!",1174521600,10,2832,4.746421267893661
1834680,4,B00008DDJ7,"This is an early 2000s Firm video from the series that uses the Fanny Lifter, a tall, square step which is adjustable to three heights.  This unique piece of equipment is effectively used here to provide a short, fun, intense cardio workout.  In addition to the Fanny Lifter (FL), light weights are occasionally added for 4-limbed work, but this is a pure cardio routine with no toning intervals.

Instructor Lisa Kay, who leads a class of 4 other Firm instructors, begins with a basic 4-minute warm-up which combines aerobic moves with dynamic stretches.  The first aerobics segment is performed without the step.  It moves somewhat slowly, with heel digs and back rocks, but my heart rate still got up, especially with the addition of small optional hops.  The first step aerobics portion with weights was a lot of fun, combining heel digs and rocks on and off the short portion of the FL with bicep curls.  Other combos included straddles with upright rows and rear dips.  There was some take it from the top here, but not so much that I found it annoying or overly repetitive.  Squats with hammer curls on the floor conclude this segment.

More step work follows, this time without the weights.  This segment was also fun and included A-steps, hamstring curls, knee lifts, L-steps, and floor jacks.  The next segment is mostly on the floor, but you add taps onto the fully assembled FL.  Here you get a bit more toning work with squats and overhead presses, but you are still moving at an aerobic pace.  Another fun aerobic step series follows, this time with straddles, side leg lifts, squats with 1 leg on the step, and presses onto the step.  This section was also a bit easier to follow than the first step tune.  The final aerobics segment consists of more 4-limb work, with grapevines/rhomboid pinch, step touch/bicep curls, and step knee (adding in a step onto the FL).

1834685,2,B00008DDJ7,"""The Firm: Cardio Sculpt Blaster"" provides 30 minute aerobic workout.  The pace is very fast throughout.  Exercise concentrates on step aerobics and floor aerobics.  Equipment needed:  low step (6"" to 8""), and light weights (2 to 5 lbs).  A tall step (18"" to 22"") is mentioned during the workout, but not really used -- all you do is lift a foot to the height of the step, so anything that height would suit.  The workout includes several twisting movements and standing on the toe movements, which place strain on ankles and knees.  Low impact aternative moves are presented throughout.  The tape provides a good aerobic workout, and a poor muscle building workout.  Instruction quality is fair -- confusing the first time, but you'll catch on fast.

Normally, I love FIRM workout tapes, but not this one.  The pace was too frantic for me, the twisting moves problematic, and I found the overall exercise session pretty borring -- the FIRM usually does a better job at being entertaining.  My two main problems with this exercise video, though, concern the music and the visual appearance.

The music consists of a repetative percussion piece that sounds really awful.  If I could turn off the music, I would.  Maybe it was written to mimic 2002 hard rock hits?  Perhaps it might appeal to teens.

Also, the visual appearance is the ugliest I've ever seen in a workout video, including the really early step aerobic videos with only one person that looked like someone filmed it in their concrete basement.  The walls are plain white, the floor is pale wood, and everyone is wearing identical costumes:  yellow tops and skin tight black pants.  There are about a half dozen women performing the steps, but all look like twins -- identical hair cuts, identical build, identical clothes, identical hair color (dark blond), identical age (around 30), identical skin tone (caucasian), identical gender (female).  All of them face you throughout.  Typically the FIRM does a great job at providing simulating backdrop, but ""Cardio Sculpt Blaster"" did not.",1143676800,3,2050,4.9676470588235295
1834686,4,B00008DDJ7,"I rented this video at the library over a year ago and absolutely hated it, I thought I would give it another try, glad I did.  Lisa Kay leads your through a 30 minute cardio workout along with 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who shows beginner modifications.  You will use the Firm Fanny Lifter for this one, but a normal step will do if you don't have it.  Light weights are also used in some sections.

You will start out with a simple warmup then you go into your first cardio segment which is low impact.  You will see marches, heel digs, step squats, calf pumps, lunges, knee lifts, all with simple arm movements.  Some of the moves are performed with hops or jumps but you can leave those out if you prefer.

The next segment is step aerobics with light dumbells, I used 3 pounders for this.  You will do heel digs and heel rocks with bicep curls, straddles with modified upright rows, lunges with tricep kickbacks, lunges off the back of the step with rhomboid pinches, all on the step.  Squats with hammer curls on the floor finish out this set.

More step follows, this time without weights.  This segment includes basic steps, A-steps, hamstring curls, knee lifts, L-steps, over the tops, and some jacks off the step.

For the next segment you will fully assemble the Fanny Lifter and do some power moves with light weights.  You will do overhead presses while tapping your foot on top of the platform, then you will move into squats with variations, step squats, alternating side to side, pulsing, etc.  Surprisingly I was quite winded by the end of this segment.

The next segment is more step aerobics, this routine includes straddles, side leg lifts, over the tops into squats, lunges off the back, and press steps into tap overs.  I liked this segment.

The final part is more 4 limb aerobics with light weights using the step for part of the routine, though most of it is done on the floor.  You will see grapevines with rhomboid pinches, step touches with bicep curls, knee lifts first on the floor, then the option to move to the step if you want.

Time to start cooling down, in this segment you will see simple moves such as marches, step touches, hamstring curls, tri-stars, sambas and side lunges.

Overall, I really liked this workout, it might take a few tries to get it all down but once you do it is a nice routine with variety.  Lisa Kay is a pleasant instructor who seems to be having fun herself.  It is better suited for beginner/intermediate levels, advanced won't get much of a workout with this one.  I think it's a keeper.",1126396800,17,2574,4.547826086956522

The old tapes w/my old box (now called the fanny lifter) are unsurpassable. The new tapes with those seemingly fake southern accents are a cheap imitation of the originals.  I am presently looking for the tape which features Susan Harris, whom I have always heard was outstanding as well as other original tapes.  For someone who seen the originals, I am NOT at all impressed with the new tapes.  It also seems that the new ""fanny lifter"" is just a way of increasing revenue AKA making more money on an old product. They really should not have fixed what wasn't broken.  They took a perfectly good product and introduced a cheaper quality one of plastic no less. There is one positive aspect of this particular tape as well as the other 3 new  tapes  which I have purchased, the new tapes are ideal if you are pressed for time. You can then get in in a semi-descent work out and I do stress the semi descent part.",1094342400,7,1051,4.442708333333333

This video is really awesome because it is challenging but time will just wiz by.  The steps do take a little time to get used to.  I disagree with one of the other reviewers who said that Lisa (the instructor) does a poor job teaching the steps.  She does not hold your hand and break down each move, but the moves are not complicated.  You can pick it up by watching 1 pass and following along.  Overall, this is one of my favorite FIRM's because it goes by quick and it gives your muscles abreak from the heavy weights.

1834703,4,B00008DDJ7,"This is another Firm Video that I did NOT like the first time I tried it.  Since its name was Cardio Sculpt Blaster, I expected it to be much more like Cardio Sculpt from the Body Sculpting System 1.  It's similar, but it is mostly cardio with some light weights and very little actual weight training.  Since then, I've really seen how this video can help on days when an hour+ long tape just isn't going to fit into your schedule.  It's also great for ""rest"" days when you aren't doing sculpting.
Keep in mind that this video does require the fanny lifter or some sort of step.  It does include some more complicated step movements - if you have trouble, try concentrating just on the foot movements and not arms.  Once you get the feet down, add the arms.
As usual, remember to keep water near you when you work out - the Firm neglects to remind us.",1079481600,5,852,4.327044025157233

I have been easing back into exercising after having a baby and after doing this routine just once, BOY! I could really feel it in my thighs, my buns, and my arms.  The routine is easy to follow and it is safe.  ALot of attention given to your butt and thighs with all of the squats.  The music is ok, but hardly noticeable because the routine is so much fun!! I rarely say that about exercising but I have found the Firm series to be truly fun and I look forward to doing them.  Get this one for sure! For those days when you only have 40 minutes to work out (the routine is 30 min. I am giving time to dress, undress..etc.) And, it is REALLY TRUE what they claim in their ads, You WILL See a noticeable difference in 10 workouts --- after 10 workouts, my family and friends were commenting about my appearance -- especially my butt and legs -- and I didn't think I could see any difference!!

My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,2,1486,4.427007299270073
