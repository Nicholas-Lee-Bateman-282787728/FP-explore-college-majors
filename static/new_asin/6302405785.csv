7826212,4,6302405785,"This talented satirical film is one that Bunuel produced during the ""Mexican Years"" in the 1950's, which is filmed in black and white with English subtitles. At first you begin to think it is like a ""Leave it to Beaver"" soap opera, put the plot develops fast and the characters develop quickly.

Based on Guy de Maupassant's short story Pierre Et Jean, a story about a beautiful young woman that is miserably trapped in a marriage of convenience, has an affair with this man that finds her precious little spoiled boy Carlitos. He is not rich but a romantic, and neither was she before she married this wealthy older sexist, and controlling man. She falls madly in love with this man who is down to earth, loathes the vulgarity of the rich, and not part of her bourgeois circle.

The affair is short, however he wants her to runaway with him to Brazil to live a simple and ""real"" life full of love, but she declines because of her son supposedly.

Twenty some years later, now with two sons that have successfully completed medical school, suddenly a fortune is left to the younger son from a foreigner who dies in Brazil, creating chaos to this well to do family.

The once loving relationship between the brothers begins to get ugly because of the inheritance, and once the obvious reason why the money was left to the younger son is out in the open Carlitos starts questioning the integrity of his own mother and other women for that matter. However there is much more, you have to see it.

Bunuel uses this soap opera technique to brutally reveal the egotistic and bourgeois hypocrisy of the characters in this film.",1106870400,4,1620,4.611111111111111
