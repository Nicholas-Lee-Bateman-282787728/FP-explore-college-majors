7921794,2,B00004S8ZZ,"A little to hard for kids IMHO, but if your kid is a work out freak or something, I guess this would do.",1355788800,,104,3.5652173913043477
7921795,1,B00004S8ZZ,"This video is NOT very good for kids. The movements are very similar, if not the exact same as the adult Tae-Bo video. Kids are kids and they need to be treated & respected as kids. Sure this video has children doing (attempting) to do the movements, but it is not at all children oriented. My families personal favorite is Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, Rich Grogan realizes that kids are kids, and should be treated accordingly.

Sorry Billy, pretty good job with the adult video, POOR job with the children's video.",1101254400,8,519,4.463157894736842
7921796,1,B00004S8ZZ,"There isn't a lot of instruction in this video, so unless kids come to it with a working knowledge of kickboxing, they're not going to benefit. The moves aren't explained, which is essential to prevent injury, and Blanks doesn't cue well, so it's difficult to keep up. The nine year old in our house hates this video and finds it frustrating to try and keep up.",1091750400,5,361,4.484848484848484
7921797,2,B00004S8ZZ,"This video was a little disappointing. It really didn't appear to me to be kid friendly. Billy does a good job with the adult Tae-Bo, but he didn't seem to have it with the kids. Besides I think most of the movements were the same for the kid's Tae-Bo as they were for the adult Tae-Bo. I didn't care for this, I thought he could have been more creative. In my opinion Billy should stick to adult exercise videos. If you want a good kid's exercise video, check out Kick to Get Fit Jr. For Kids, Rich Grogan shows what creativity is all about.",1078963200,10,542,4.221153846153846
7921798,5,B00004S8ZZ,Bought this video spring of 2003 for my 5yr old daughter. We love it ! It's a bit fast for my daughter but she loves it anyway and still does her best. It is not just great for kids but also for anyone interested in starting Tae-Bo. I would definately recommend this video before starting the adult version. When you finish this video you will have a lot more energy and feel great!,1070064000,4,382,4.2465753424657535
7921799,4,B00004S8ZZ,"I use this frequently with second-graders.  We have a weekly exercise class with 3 other classes.  It gets them moving, and the boys really like it.  One word of caution, you have to set ground rules (lots of room around each kid, no touching or hitting or kicking others).  The only problem is that Billy gets quiet at times when he's giving really important information (like how to kick safely without locking your knees).  Most kids can't hear this info in a crowded room.",1021939200,8,476,4.619047619047619
7921800,4,B00004S8ZZ,"I have two children ages 12 & 4.  They both beg me to let them do this video on the weekends.  They think it's very fun & sometimes ask to do it twice.
My only real complaint is the sound quality.  There are times when Billy is giving the kids pointers (which he does frequently to keep the kids safe & give them encouragement) but you can't hear & understand what he's saying.  The camera angles are good showing kids up close.
It's a short workout that makes kids use their muscles in a fun, safe way with easy tae bo moves. The first few times I did it I broke a sweat.",1021766400,10,572,4.035398230088496
7921801,2,B00004S8ZZ,"I bought this one hoping to get some ideas for my martial arts classes I teach children. I found it was just a rehash of other Tae Bo videos with kids working out with Billy instead of adults. The moves are basically the  same. Having taught kids martial arts for 10 + years, I doubt if most kids  would get into this video. After doing it a few times I think most kids  would be back to the video games. IMO, kids would find this boring...I find  it after a few viewings boring. I think Billy could have engaged the kids  in more fun activity while working out. If you're into Tae Bo and want the  kids to do it with you, then try this one. Otherwise if you want the kids  to exercise, get them out of the house and into a fun activity that will be  varied and not bore them.",961545600,43,776,4.026143790849673
7921802,4,B00004S8ZZ,"How many times were you in the middle of your Tae Bo class and thought to yourself ""You know, I love Tae Bo, and I love lifting my knee to my chest over and over and over again. But lately my kids have become distant,  detached. Like they don't love me anymore. What's going on! ""  Well,  maybe they're jealous. Jealous of that sweet Tae Bo action. But now it  doesn't have to be that way anymore. Billy Blanks has made it possible for  you to become re-aquainted with your children and not miss a step of that  boxing/ballet workout. Hear Billy Blanks encourage your child with positive  affirmations like ""Stay in School"" and ""C'mon let's Tae  Bo!"" And in a pinch the video can also act as a babysitter when no  other resources are available. Just put the video on play and watch the  kids be glued to the screen Tae Boing their way to good fitness while you  go out and smoke 20 cigarettes. Also, the video can cure insomnia as Billy  Blanks sweet soothing voice rocks you to a blissful slumber and you dream  of Tae Boing with him personally....on the moon.....and you're both naked.  So why are you still reading this review. Less talk more action! Get off  the couch, get outta bed! Click on your mouse and buy this  video!
Warning: This video is not recommended for midgets or dwarves.",956620800,22,1292,4.43404255319149
