8506895,5,B006ZE9QLO,This DVD combo was very helpful in learning tricks for hula hoop dancing.  The DVDs are instructions for hand placement and proper hooping technique and they are not meant to be used as workout DVDs.  I would highly recommend starting this DVD series with Level 1 because the rest build off of techniques used in the beginning.,1357689600,7,327,4.719298245614035
