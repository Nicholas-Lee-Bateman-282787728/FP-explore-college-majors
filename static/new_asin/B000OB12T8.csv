It was truly a great variety of songs that just touched my heart.  If you aren't able to attend a live concert, this will show you what you've missed.",1519084800,,323,4.095238095238095

8184160,5,B000OB12T8,I have seen them sing at a couple of Gaither concerts and they are great. I am ordering this one myself because it has all my favorite songs they sing on it. I would recommend them to anyone. They sing primarily Bluegrass music but they do a wonderful job on other songs they sing as well.,1253577600,2,289,4.178571428571429
