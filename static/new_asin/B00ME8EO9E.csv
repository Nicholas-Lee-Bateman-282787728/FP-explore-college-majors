8671721,4,B00ME8EO9E,"once again a military action run by bureaucrats in Washington D.C rather than military commanders on the scene. It didn't work for Vietnam and it won't work for Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan or other parts of the middle east or western Asia. Military might is no match for a good negotiator backed by a strong government who supports the negotiator and opposes the foe being negotiated with. I find it unbelievable that the big brains in D.C haven't figured this out yet. It's certainly no help that the Obama Administration has weakened America to the prestige of a weak, third world, corrupt, banana republic run by a regulatory bureaucracy. Where has America gone?",1463702400,,661,4.910714285714286

8671723,5,B00ME8EO9E,"Losing Iraq covers the period from the fall of Baghdad in April 2003 until December 2011. The documentary has a narrow focus and mostly deals with the military situation. The filmmakers talk to soldiers, journalists, and many of the decision makers. They are all refreshingly honest about what happened.

The film suggests that the Bush administration was unsure what to after the Iraqi army had been defeated. No post-war plan had been prepared to run the country. In May 2003, the White House decided to pull the troops out and hand over responsibility to an American civilian, Paul Bremer. The filmmakers believe that things went seriously wrong under Bremer's leadership. Bremer was a Washington insider who was seen as tough and decisive. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about the Middle East and was not good at listening to advice. Bremer made two disastrous decisions: dissolving the Iraqi military and de-Baathifying the government. His policies put 200,000 armed men on the streets with no future.

In August 2003 the Red Cross and UN HQs were attacked, and there appeared to be a coordinated campaign to drive out anyone who could help the US govern the country. With the insurgency underway, it became impossible to withdraw US troops. Chaos reigned and Colin Powell's prediction was proved right: if you break it, you own it. The optimism that American troops would be treated as liberators quickly faded. From this point on the US was reacting to events and trying to maintain order. The military was stuck in a quagmire with no clear idea who it was fighting. The need for intelligence led to Abu Ghraib, which radicalized many ordinary Iraqis. The film claims that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and the administration were in a state of denial about the insurgency. The war was not going well and too many American soldiers were being killed. Bremer left Iraq ignominiously in 2004, and Rumsfeld was replaced in 2006.

In 2007 General Jack Keane proposed a new strategy he called the Surge. David Petraeus was picked to implement it. The biggest change Petraeus made, was to put the Sunni insurgents on the payroll. In the end, 103,000 Sunnis joined Petraeuss army. The cost was $400 million. The Surge seemed to work and by December 2008 Iraq was relatively peaceful and the US had avoided military defeat. However, Iraq was still far from a normal country. In January 2009 Iraq became President Obamas problem. Obama was not interested in Iraq, he thought the war was a mistake and gave it to Joe Biden to manage. The last US troops left the country in December 2011.

In 2006 the US decided that Iraq needed a new prime minister, someone less sectarian. They picked Nouri al-Maliki, an obscure Shiite politician. Maliki was inexperienced but President Bush decided to train him. Unfortunately, Maliki turned out to be a disaster. After the American troops leave, Maliki begins a crackdown on the Sunni population. He stops paying the Sunni tribesmen and becomes increasingly paranoid. He starts to purge the government of Sunnis and Kurds. A civil war begins soon afterwards. Unfortunately, the new Iraqi army, which was trained at great expense by the US taxpayer, was not much use. It ran away from ISIS. There are now calls to send American combat troops back to Iraq to restore order. The film suggests that there is perhaps too much bad blood for Iraq ever to be put back together again.

The US was in Iraq for nearly nine years. Over 4,000 Americans were killed and more than 30,000 were wounded. The estimated cost was $2 trillion. The obvious question, not asked by the filmmakers, is whether it was all worth it. The film ends with the news that American advisors are being sent to Iraq. The film does not explain how the US might extricate itself from this mess, or how long American troops might have to stay. Lt. General Dan Bolger who trained the new Iraqi army concluded in a recent book, that the US should have declared victory in 2003 and left. Losing Iraq is an excellent, if depressing documentary.",1438214400,3,4043,4.86211901306241

It highlighted the step by step process of how incompetence, the lack a vision and the lack of true understanding of the region by two American administrations lead to the near collapse of Iraq and the rise of ISIS........It is a must watch for anyone wanting to gain an ideological-free deeper understanding of the current situation and what lead to it.",1426982400,5,447,4.894736842105263
