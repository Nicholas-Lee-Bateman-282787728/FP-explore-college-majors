8018813,5,B0001ZIORK,"In 1997, I bought this very same VHS directly from PBS.
It's the only single program video that I ever paid thirty dollars for.
That's how much it meant to me.

The two hour 1997 AMERICAN MASTERS episode entitled VAUDEVILLE is narrated by Ben Vereen.
It covers this remarkable form of entertainment from its 19th Century roots
to the modern echoes of vaud, and even makes the point that channel surfing
is a form of private vaudeville where the viewer controls content.

Best thing about this documentary are the dozens of vintage film clips of vaudeville
stars and small circuit nobodies performing the acts it took them years to perfect.

The program is enriched by commentary from a dozen or more survivors, such as
Morey Amsterdam, June Havoc, Joey Faye, Carl Ballantine, the Nicholas brothers,
Rose Marie, Billy Barty, Iron Eyes Cody, June Taylor, Arthur Tracy and Bobby Short.

8018814,5,B0001ZIORK,A lot of the people shown have sinced passed away.  It shows a lot of the lesser known acts and talks about what it took to survive in Vaudville.  The film clips show a time that is unlikely to be replicated.  Unlike YouTube and other similiar venues these artists honed their acts doing shows a dozen times a week (ig they were lucky enough to get a spot) and teh final product had to survive the toughest critics-live audiences who were allowed to throw carbage at the really bad acts.,1280448000,2,487,4.388888888888889
