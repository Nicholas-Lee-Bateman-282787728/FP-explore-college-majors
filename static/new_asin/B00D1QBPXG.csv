The main reason is the orchestra. The West-Eastern Divan is, essentially, an orchestra in its adolescence. The Pastorale and the Choral symphony are high points. The Eighth, with its diaphanous composition, almost always risks suffering most under the romantic spell and does so here as well. Barenboim's Fifth is radically rooted in the German tradition, so dramatically, that it will probably remain a point of debate. The rest of the cycle, like the fifth, is hefty, but rich, idiosyncratic, and never dull.

There is a temptation to ask: ""why?"" of this cycle, after such an excellent traversal in 2005. Well, of course, it's part of a big marketing extravaganza called ""Beethoven for All."" This includes a traversal through the piano sonatas and piano concertos. Both of these, Barenboim has performed and recorded before (to mixed results, but never better than here.)

Part of that package was a filming of the nine symphonies and five concertos, along with the aptly named documentary: ""The Nine Symphonies that changed the world."" The documentary, directed by Michael Waldman, is thorough and revealing as the filmmakers follow Barenboim and musicians (which include Barenboim's son) to China and South Korea. Barenboim's extensive musicology is both metaphorical and analytical. He theorizes as much about music as Mengelberg reportedly did. Even if one does not agree with some of his aesthetic choices, Barenboim is clearly passionate, which can be seen when he takes some of his players to task. That infamous Barenboim ego is no mere legend.

The filmed performances of these symphonies (and concertos)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Barenboim-Staatskapelle-Berlin-Beethoven-Piano-Concertos-1-5-Blu-ray/dp/B002P9K9SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Barenboim/Staatskapelle Berlin: Beethoven - Piano Concertos 1-5 [Blu-ray</a>] , really is the way to go with this cycle (as opposed to the CDs). Yes, they are the same performances, but are so lush and lucid in the visual documentation that ""seeing"" the event, filmed in the splendor of the BBC Proms setting, with committed music-making, and enthusiasm, considerably diminishes reservations to all but those who are already cemented in long-standing ""bandwagon""biases; biases which are overdue in addressing:

The ""general"" rule of thumb in assessing Barenboim's art is to dismiss all the cliched, dull and, yes, inherently lazy ""copying Furtwangler"" crutches/accusations that so many armchair critics unimaginatively lean on and repeat like a broken record. That Barenboim has a lifelong admiration for and identification with Furtwangler's ""better"" performances is well known. Likewise (and less known), Barenboim holds a similarly strong identification with Klemperer, Celibidache, Walter, and Kubelik. In other words, Barenboim jumps from the Romantic diving board. He identifies with much in the German Romantic tradition, as opposed to being influenced by it. Essentially, Barenboim is, on the surface, a bit of an oxymoron: he is a post modern romantic. While his identification plane is clear, it is also eclectic and Barenboim comes up his own man.

Like Klemperer, Barenboim is not adverse to elements of modernism, and this includes his exemplary work with innovative stage directors like Harry Kupfer (Parisfal and the Ring)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Parsifal/dp/B006ZV6YUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Parsifal</a>, Doris Dorrie (Cosi)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Cosi-Fan-Tutte-Barenboim-Roschmann-Kammerloher-Bruera-Gura-Chausson-Berlin-Opera/dp/B0000TSRCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Cosi Fan Tutte / Barenboim, Roschmann, Kammerloher, Bruera, Gura, Chausson, Berlin Opera</a>&nbsp;,the late Patrice Chereau (Wozzeck,Tristan)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wozzeck/dp/B00BK6HQZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wozzeck</a>&nbsp;,and Heiner Muller (another excellent Tristan)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Tristan-und-Isolde-Barenboim-Bayreuth-Festival/dp/B0012NO92O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Tristan und Isolde  (Barenboim, Bayreuth Festival)</a>&nbsp;. Barenboim has also ventured into modern music with generally good results: His recent Schoenberg is superb, ranking with the likes of Karajan and Stokowski. Barenboim probably conducts Boulez better than Boulez (as he conducts Furtwangler better than Furtwangler, his Corigliano is still reference, and his occasional forays into Mahler have, on the whole, proven more interesting and sympathetic than committed Mahlerians, such as Abbado and Rattle. I include Mahler here because some attribute modernistic tenets to that composer (I am less reluctant to these days, with the exception of the 6th and 7th. Btw, Barenboim's 7th may be a reference that can compare to the likes of Scherchen, Gielen, Rosbaud, Kubelik,and Bernstein).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniell-Barenboim-conducts-Mahler-Symphony-No-9/dp/B0044FEZ80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniell Barenboim conducts Mahler: Symphony No. 9</a>

Less consistent is Barenboim's handling of French music, although he is an excellent Debussian, and has long devotion to both tango music&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barenboim-Daniel-Tango-Argentina/dp/B004A42XJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barenboim, Daniel: Tango Argentina</a>and jazz.

In an eclectic repertoire, Barenboim proves himself far more able and versatile than those he is often compared to (always to his disadvantage), but It does not end there. While Barenboim is an inconsistent artist (as all conductors are), his musicianship is consummate. Unevenness aside, in his commonly grounded German repertoire (mainly Beethoven, Wagner, and Bruckner) he proves himself a better conductor and more uniformly inspired than either Furtwangler or Klemperer (although R. Strauss and the Brahms symphonies strangely elude Barenboim).

While Furtwangler's Eroica and Choral are wholly deserving of their reputations, his various Fifths are a wildly uneven lot and the remaining symphonies, while generally good, have been bettered numerous times over, past and present (Barenboim being among those who have bested the master).

Barenboim's Wagner, while occasionally plagued by the dearth of good Wagnerian singers, is excellently conducted and, again, that excellence is far more consistent than Furtwangler (Although Furtwangler's Legge-produced Tristan and the wretched-sounding La Scala Ring are still performance references).

Furtwangler's Bruckner rep is well-deserved, but he had his clunkers (the mostly limpid '54 Eighth and wreck of a '51 Fifth). Additionally, Furtwangler, being a technophobe, immeasurably hurt his recorded legacy, as did Toscanini (and there were other conductors, during the period, who were insightfully committed to better sounding recordings).

Barenboim's excellence in Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Schumann (although, again, uneven) have rendered inefficient and are preferable to the bulk of Furtwangler's way with those composers. Similar comparisons could be made between Barenboim and Klemperer, Celibidache, et al.

The much missed, erudite musicologist Harold C. Schonberg (NY Times) was among those who, early on, rightly called out the ""Copying Furtwangler"" robotic catcalls as ""ill-informed and sloppy listening"" (this being in assessment of both Barenboim's conducting and pianistic skills). David Hurwitz is among the newer crop of critics who echo Schonberg.

Of course, it doesn't matter what Hurwitz or Schonberg write, those married to their pre-exisiting, tedious biases will still choose to pour over Barenboim's idiosyncrasies like a fundamentalist scrutinizes over every single line from their bible. This is their limitation and while I have immense admiration for that priest; Furtwangler, I have not canonized him. It appears to do so obscures and hinders an even-handed embrace of an authentic and original, contemporary, romantic tradition.

* With a plethora of great Beethoven cycles, including Barenboim's earlier one, this CD version of  the 9 symphonies, simply is not competitive. However, the DVD version is a visual standout. Still, it is overpriced and the suggestion would be to wait until that price is reduced. There are many excellent filmed cycles available on DVD or Blue-ray, including The top choice of Karajan's indispensable, innovative DG traversal (avoid the 80's Sony issues). Other, recent, well-filmed cycles would be Abbado's with the BPO (which, as we can see, now has many female members. It appears HVK won the unisex battle posthumously) and Thielemann's with the Wiener Philharmoniker. All of these are far more competitive, price-wise, but as a visual cycle, Barenboim's is second only to Karajan.",1385424000,7,9609,6.71761866452132
5767080,5,B00D1QBPXG,"In 1999 Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said organized the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Seville.  Seville was chosen because here there was a culture where Israel and Arab peoples lived in peace and acceptance.  Yes, there is an overabundance of Beethovan symphonies on cd and dvd, mostly played by seasoned, older musicians who play the notes perfectly, but who have lost the youthful exuberance that Beethovan requires.  Here we have the kind of orchestra that people like Gustavo Dudamel conduct.  I now own everything that Gustavo has recorded because where the older, more seasoned conductors give correctness and facility, Gustavo gives enthusiasm and excitement: a vision that is closer to the excitement that produced the masterworks in the first place. This Beethovan collection gives the ""Dudamel effect"" with a conductor who knew Beethovan piano sonatas from age 8, but who is as excited about Beethovan performance as his youthful performers.  Daniel is a seasoned Beethovan interpreter!!  This Proms performance for the 2012 Olympics is historic and you just need to listen to the excited ovations to know that these performances are unique and historic.  Little did I know that I was getting ""the last word in Beethovan.""  This is a dvd I will return to over and over again.  Beethovan should be required listening for those desirous of remaining youthful.  Thank you, Ludwig!",1379376000,8,1389,5.216216216216216

8588350,4,B00D1QBPXG,"(Note: I also reviewed this album on HDVDarts.com, and there is some duplication between the 2 reviews.)
** Modified to 4 stars ** Although this Blu-ray set is very enjoyable, I feel it lacks the sense of ""event"" (e.g. tension) that is present in the most special Blu-ray/DVD recordings (e.g. Harnoncourt & RCO Beethoven Missa Solemnis; Jansons & Bayerischen Rundfunks Verdi Requiem; P. Jrvi and Orchestre de Paris Faure Requiem, Abbado & Simn Bolvar Tchaikovsky 6, etc.).  However, no serious reservations.  If you've experienced Fischer's Mahler 4 with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, you may be able to imagine his Beethoven - with a hefty dose of transparency & lightness ...but always very beautiful.
-------------------------------
I have found this Fischer-RCO set of Beethoven symphonies on Blu-ray to be immensely gratifying.  Do not expect the drive and ferocity of Paavo Jrvi (with the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen), the period-fizz of Gardiners 90s recordings (with the ORR), or the more sumptuously romantic readings from Barenboim (with the Berliner Staatskapelle).  This Fischer cycle brings to my mind such descriptions as classical and restrained, yet despite their undeniable impression of lightness they generate an excitement of their own and they always represent (to my ears) the highest order of musicianship.

Fischers well-considered tempi never impede forward momentum, while allowing space for the RCO musicians to create beautiful sounds and phrases.  Clean textures and superior sound quality allow all instrumental details to be heard.  As a result of Fischers rhythmic drive and observation of accents, I found a heightened awareness of folk elements in the music (as expected, most prominent in the Symphony No. 6).

Perhaps the most compelling reason I feel drawn to this set is the continual sense of musical conversation.  The melodic lines meander between sections of the orchestra and pass between soloists with such acuity and musicality!

The Blu-ray discs are well organized, with easy to navigate menus and no background menu music.  The audience is not overly intrusive, with the usual cacophony of coughs between movements (perhaps Fischer, in part, allows for this with a total relaxation of tension between movements), and a couple of instances where an overzealous audience member shouts ""Bravo"" before the final sounds of a symphony have faded.  Alas - this seems to be unavoidable in live performances.

In closing, I have confidence that the stunning sounds and imagery of this Beethoven cycle will bear repeated listening and viewing.  Enjoy!",1431216000,7,2599,5.432835820895522
8588351,5,B00D1QBPXG,"In the last while there have been 6 video recordings of Beethovens Nine Symphonies. They followed von Karajans two of which only the first still holds, while the second belongs to the archives. Of the last video recordings, in my opinion, the best are Jansons, Jaervi and now Fischer. Abbado (Ninth), Tielemann and Barenboim reflect practices of past eras (Wagners influence), while the last three attempt at approaching Beethovens fast markings. Each succeeds it with great success. Since there are good reviews of Jansons and Jaervi (alas!, under the latters in Amazon are given mostly Abbados reviews), let me briefly comment on Fischers latest recording. The name of this Hungarian conductor was unknown to me and I hesitated to pre-order his set being very pleased with Jaervi and Jansons. Am I ever glad I got it since I have stopped counting the times I have been listening to and watching this live recording (11 May 2013: 1 2 5; 31 May 2013 : 3 4; 9-10 January 2014: 6 7; 20-21 February 2014: 8 9). The Amsterdam Royal Concertgebouw orchestra and singers acquit themselves with flying colors. There are no weaknesses in any department of the performance, with particularly excellent performances by three women, one playing the French horn, another the flute and the third the bassoon (the last two excel in Symphonies 3, 4, 8, 9. One wishes that somehow the names of the instrument players were posted, but then without their pictures one still would not know who is who?). The approach of Maestro Fischer is not to measure Beethoven against his past or the future but to stare, as it were, into the genius face directly. It is hard to choose which movement reveals so much of Beethovens technique wonderfully described by Berlioz in terms of melody, harmony, rhythm, expression, modulation, instrumentation, situation in regard to the listener and accumulation of sound, but movements two in the Fourth, Sixth and Seventh are of an unsurpassed beauty, interpreted with great accuracy and detail. Berlioz mentions that the second movement of the Seventh was the most requested for encores. I could never understand much why despite listening to 30 different top CD recordings more than once until watching now Fischers (but here one has to add Jansons and Jaervis) interpretations. The Ninth is superbly played with the soloists at their best: Gerald Finlay (Canadian baritone), Bernarda Fink (Argentinian of Slovenian parentage mezzo-soprano), Myrto Papatanasiu (Greek soprano) and Burkhard Fritz (German tenor). It is rather interesting that on the stage they are not placed close to each other, as is usual, but at some distance, which in part affects the reception of their deliveries. The filming and sound recording are excellent, although there are no titles for any of the movements (they appear only if you play the movements separately), no resume function, and, perhaps, the most missed are the subtitles. Still, all in all, this set is the one to add to ones collection and keep enjoying it ever after!",1430006400,9,3024,5.037924151696607
8588352,5,B00D1QBPXG,"Though regarded the greatest of the symphonic pieces, there are some reluctances to release new Beethoven symphony cycle. How can it attract consumers in these too competitive field? Rather Mahler's symphonies are more paid attention to by classical music-lovers around anniversary year in 2010 & 2011. Even Bernard Haitink, renowned Mahler interpreter criticized too frequent Mahler performances & recordings. However, in the 21st century, we can easily observe new releases of Beethoven symphonies. In this context, SACD & blu-ray format are actively chosen since 2000.
Interestingly enough, top-tier orchestras in Europe have presented new Beethoven cycle recently. From the highly respected Abbado/BPO's cycle in Rome (only No. 9 was played in Berlin), Chailly/Leipzig Gewandhaus (Decca CDs), Thilemann/VPO (Cmajor blu-rays) and Tokyo live of Jansons/BRSO (Arhaus blu-rays) have been released.
Jansons chose BRSO instead of RCO as a partner. Obviously RCO has been somewhat remote from Beethoven symphonies since 1990's.

RCO's complete live Mahler recordings in blu-ray format was an important milestone utilizing HD recording technology (24bits/96khz).

RCO's new Beethoven cycle was partnered by Ivan Fischer (conducting Mahler No. 4 in complete cycle!). Ivan Fischer's Beethoven is to some extent affected by Nicolas Harnoncourt, one of the important conductors co-working with RCO.
General thinking with respect to RCO's Beethoven symphony can be summarized as follows.
""RCO's sound is too polished and mellow for Beethoven! Maybe even numbers are well suited to the orchestra's sound. But No. 3, 5, 7 & 9?""
However, this blu-ray capturing live performance in 2013 May & 2014 January, Februay easily betray stereotype perception.
RCO and Fischer successfully presented Beethoven No. 1 to No. 8 combining clean & transparent music-making with silky sound. Beethoven's characteristic fire and tension are also well presented. Especially in No. 5 & 6, you can enjoy very innovative new trial of conductor. And RCO live blu-ray's sound quality is peerless. I can enjoy famous Concertgebouw's luxurious sound in my home. Through both high-end audio systems and buget audio systems, it works so well.
One reservation is symphony No. 9. Though high-calibre sound, the degree of excitement is somewhat weak. A little polite!

In conclusion, welcome addition to Beethoven blu-ray discs. We can cleanly catch the notes from various orchestral sectors even in pianissimo. This cleanly separated sound picture will enhance your understanding of Beethoven symphonies.",1429920000,9,2563,5.68668407310705
