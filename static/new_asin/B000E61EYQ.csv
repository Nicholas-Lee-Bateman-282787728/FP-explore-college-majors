However we purchased the DVD collection because we didn't start watching the show from the beginning, and I am not really pleased with the DVD's.  I think they cut out an extreme amount from the TV series, in fact they cut out so much if you are not really fimilar with the show you wouldn't know whats going on. After all if you are going to release the first season on DVD shouldn't it be the WHOLE first season not just what they could fit into 16 hours?  I would have also liked to have seen subtitles on the DVD.",1145836800,3,582,4.178571428571429

8324268,5,B000E61EYQ,OMG I love Rebelde. On Univision I am watching this novela and I am definately buying this dvd. But when Amazon actually has the dvd!!! I can't wait. I love this Novela so much and I have all their Cd's and dvds. If you want to learn more about their albums. Search RBD on the top of amazon and look at their music. It's awesome. and if you know you have Univision Rebelde is on at 3:00pm or on UnvisonW is on at 6:00pm. I love this Novela!! OMG it's my fav!!,1137283200,3,459,4.0
