8249254,1,B00135TURU,"I'm a HUGE Sons of Provo fan and thought this would be awesome. The only thing I found funny was the 2 minute clip of fake commercials Will Swenson starred in. I would pay 2 bucks for this, MAX. Doesn't have the characters returning, and is basically an interview of other stars talking about them. Not well produced, and just falls flat. Save your money and don't buy this (even if you LOVE Sons of Provo. Not worth it!)",1524182400,,421,4.341772151898734
8249255,4,B00135TURU,"Funny movie, great follow up to the original, but GOTTA see the first one, it was hilarious! Makes me wonder where it will go next.",1326240000,,131,4.28
8249256,3,B00135TURU,"I give this the same three stars as the movie, largely for the same reason:  shot on the cheap, and a fairly skimpy running time.  But if you can get this for a good price and have the SONS OF PROVO ""film"" (art--loosely defined), it's a great and necessary bookend.  The set comes with a ""bonus"" CD which adds to the great, great BAD music (one of my on-going interests: easy listening disco, Pat Boone rocking out, Tony Bennett doing drug rock, Shatner, Nimoy, and Hasselhoff) album that is the soundtrack to the ""film.""  --the additional CD songs being ""The Balad of Marvin P. Jensen,"" ""I Forgive You,"" ""Treasure Beyond Measure,"" and ""Sons of Provo Mega-Mix (Stake Dance Version).""  See you here in Utah at the multi-level marketing conventions with all the other folks who don't/can't afford to tip, have one good suit with cheap shoes annoying the restaurant waiters and bellmen with ""get rich, QUICK!"" desperate networking.

Three apples--recommended!",1325980800,,956,4.94375
8249257,5,B00135TURU,Loved it!  Funny & entertaining!  These guys are a riot!  The music was fun and Kirby Heybourne is always great to watch! It's a must have for every family DVD library!,1317859200,,168,4.354838709677419
8249258,1,B00135TURU,I didn't think this was funny enough to make this documentary.  It was especially disappointing that the main cast of the first movie isn't even in this one!,1282521600,4,157,4.607142857142857
