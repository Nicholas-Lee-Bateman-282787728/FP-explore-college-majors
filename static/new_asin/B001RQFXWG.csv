8338640,4,B001RQFXWG,"Burt was his usual jerk sarcastic self. It really worked for him.
Funny enjoyable movie.  Ending was predictable but that was ok.
Reynolds seems to shine more in movies that he is able to play
a jerk, and I think that is because he does not have to act.",1355443200,,253,4.163265306122449
8338641,4,B001RQFXWG,"This is something that the Brits do well - comedy. 'A Bunch of Amateurs' joins a long list of classic comedies (In the Bleak Mid Winter, Mrs Henderson Presents, et al) that will be around forever. As an amateur performer for more than 40 years I saw myself many times as I watched characterisics that I could easily identify with or recognise from performers in my past. The film possbilbly won't be as funny for non thespians but certainly shows an aspect of theatre that is very true to life. Burt Reynolds was a curious piece of casting but I warmed to him as the story evolved. A load of fun!",1279238400,,596,4.378378378378378
