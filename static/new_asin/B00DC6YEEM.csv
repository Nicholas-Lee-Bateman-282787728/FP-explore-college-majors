5788791,5,B00DC6YEEM,"Got the DVD sooner than expected and the movie was all I thought it would be.
Will pass it along to friends",1397433600,,107,3.909090909090909
5788792,4,B00DC6YEEM,"In response to another review, this is NOT dubbed. The voices and lips are in sync. Barabbas does Not  tell Jesus to shut up. He does tell Judas Iscariot to shut up. This is a work of fiction based on a Nobel Prize winning novel. I dislike the lies portrayed near the end. Peter never went to Rome. Paul did. There is also no record of Mark's ever going to Rome.  Christ did not tell Peter that if Peter did not allow himself to be crucified then Christ would have to die again. Christ's death was a one time sacrifice. In the book and original movie, Barabbas is crucified due to his misguided part in the burning of Rome. He was never portrayed as a martyr.",1396224000,9,659,4.222222222222222
5788793,3,B00DC6YEEM,"This movie was good but not great.  The actors were really good acting out the character, the storyline starts out at the end  or mid way through and then it jumps back to the beginning.  I like how Barabbas was willing and wanting to change his ways finally at towards the end and wanting to be passionate about it.",1394841600,2,316,4.322033898305085
5788794,4,B00DC6YEEM,"All in all, this is an EXCELLENT movie for those who question their identity and their destiny in Christ.

Admittedly the storyline drags in the beginning.  Personally, I feel that this movie would have had a much bigger impact on/for families, with a little less ""action-packed"" violence and sexual-innuendo throughout the movie.

This is probably why it was not rated; and ended up as a 2012 ""lost Christian TV movie""---not readily available through Christian retailers/outlets.  With that said:

Billy Zane was totally believable as Barabbas.  Although a rogue character; Barabbas is intriguing and real when he asks all the really tough questions ---WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW, and most importantly; WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME [eventually he finds the answer to all  of these questions].

Anna Valle's character ""Claudia"" (as Pontius Pilate's wife) was also very intriguing (did she know Jesus personally?).

Although this movie is clearly not entirely factual; who can say for certain, that the real Barabbas mentioned in the Bible, was not used mightily in this way for God's purposes?

The ending was thrilling [I didn't see it coming] and easily believable---it made my heart ""skip a beat""---it made me think about what is really important in this life, and beyond!

SEE IT; and tell your friends!!!",1393372800,22,1306,5.14218009478673
5788795,5,B00DC6YEEM,"This story was nicely done. A wonderful story of redemption. I did not see the other reviews. This is not like todays films filled with and dependent upon high tech distractions. This is like the films that depend upon acting and the scenery. I think Billy Zane did a great job of being Barabbas, and Cristiana Capotondi who played Ester was wonderful. Actually all the actors and actresses made this story seem real and that is what a movie like this is supposed to do. I actually started this on T.V. but could not stay up for all of it as I had to go to work the next day so I bought it. I am very glad I did.",1390780800,8,612,4.108333333333333
5788796,4,B00DC6YEEM,"Good depiction of many happenings written in the bible. Billy Zane did a good job portraying Barrabas; especially the last scene with Peter in the prison and then on the cross. The character of Pilate was well done too.  The character of Jesus didn't have the platonic kindness in the eyes which I've seen in other portrayals, but there was a flirty look I didn't like.  Also the actress who played Esther put on too much of the ""little girl"" voice to be a little overbearing. Claudia's character was great.",1523232000,,507,4.622222222222222
5788797,4,B00DC6YEEM,Great movie !!,1522886400,,14,4.0
5788798,5,B00DC6YEEM,Absolutely well done! I love Billy Zane in this film!,1522713600,,53,4.4
5788799,5,B00DC6YEEM,"A first-class production, that includes a totally believable Jerusalem and Rome. Billy Zane is the perfect Barabbas, fighting his unbelief as fiercely as he attacked the priesthood in Jerusalem and the Roman generals. Soundtrack, photography, costumes and sword fights that didn't play around combined to make a great viewing experience. Binge viewing at its best!",1522540800,,364,5.636363636363637
5788800,2,B00DC6YEEM,"Why does Billy Zane sport an American accent and cowboy mannerisms in an ancient time in the region of the Middle east? Other characters accents vary from Italian, Spanish and Russian. Terrible acting. Unlikely scenarios, such as, Esther, a follower of Jesus, having sex with Barabbas out of wedlock. Really? I painfully limped my way through parts of all three episodes, and couldn't finish. Even the actor portraying Jesus was annoying.",1522281600,,438,5.183098591549296
5788801,1,B00DC6YEEM,"Why try to remake a perfectly good movie?  Barabbas, starring Anthony Quinn, is at the pinnacle of perfection, and will endure as a classic.  This version is slow in the story telling, boring, and filled with actors who appear like they do not enjoy their roles.  If you seek a good movie and a religious, spiritual experience then choose the Barabbas version with Anthony Quinn and avoid this really sucky remake.",1521849600,7,414,4.802816901408451
5788802,5,B00DC6YEEM,Good movie!,1511481600,,11,5.0
5788803,5,B00DC6YEEM,"Billy Zane is still as handsome as ever and really uses it to the advantage of this film. He plays a lost soul, full of the angst of his situation - a bastard or abandoned by his father at infancy, let alone the poverty and primitiveness of the era and locale. Reasonable plot and convincing dialog.",1505952000,5,299,4.357142857142857

5788807,5,B00DC6YEEM,"Billy Zane does an excellent job portraying Barabbas in this movie!  If you love bible story characters buy this movie and if you like watching a handsome well built male movie star you will enjoy watching this movie, lol!  Enjoy",1458172800,3,229,4.7
5788808,5,B00DC6YEEM,"Billy Zane is the greatest, I love to see him in any movie, Barabbas is no exception, great movie",1450137600,4,97,4.157894736842105
5788809,2,B00DC6YEEM,Wow. This is a true B movie. The voices of everyone sound really weird. The acting is wooden. The story is not all that interesting. I am not sure to whom this would appeal. I am shocked by the glowing reviews. I am glad I only paid $4 for this. It's really hard to get through because everything about it is just so cheesy.,1446163200,4,324,4.078125
5788810,3,B00DC6YEEM,This version is not bad at all and seems to follow the book more closely. Zane does a good job as Barabbas production values are decent. I'm a fan of the A. QUINN version which I thought was excellent.  This movie though not up to par with it predecessor is well worth watching.,1428192000,,278,4.245283018867925
5788811,5,B00DC6YEEM,"Anthony Quinn in Barabbas will always be dear to me as the Classic, however, I am very impressed with Billy Zane and the entire cast of the New Barabbas.",1427328000,,153,4.310344827586207
5788812,5,B00DC6YEEM,Great Addition to My Collection of Biblical Movies and a Great Addition as Billy Zane as Barabbas...,1412208000,,100,4.9411764705882355

5788815,5,B00DC6YEEM,Barabbas was fantastic.  Blu ray just made it an instant classic. What a story-told and displayed in aTelivision Epic way,1401321600,,121,5.05
8591606,3,B00DC6YEEM,"An interesting story and enjoyable to watch. It did, however, include some things that are not Biblically accurate. Peter, did not go to Rome. Paul is the one who spent time in Rome and was imprisoned there. Peter stayed mostly in Jerusalem. Several times Barabas asks, ""faith in what"". But the question never gets answered.",1529712000,,324,4.909090909090909
8591607,5,B00DC6YEEM,"It is a good story that deserves a little bit more production value.  Overlooked by many, this story tells us what happened to Barabbas.  Typecast in the 90's as the sleazeball, Billy Zane has spent the rest of his career redeeming himself in increasingly difficult but otherwise authentic and memorable roles.  This is his best.",1529107200,,329,4.945454545454545
8591608,5,B00DC6YEEM,A Great story about the Barabbas Character that was released  when Jesus was crucified. Answered a lot of Mystery about this person.,1528243200,,132,5.0
8591609,4,B00DC6YEEM,Non biblical fiction about a biblical character.  Makes you think about Barrabas' life before and after where he was mentioned in the Bible.,1526342400,,140,5.086956521739131
8591610,1,B00DC6YEEM,"Terrible.  I was mildly amused by the unintentional comedy embedded in cheesy and horrible acting, and the lack of any consistency.  That ended quickly, and I couldn't make it through the first episode.",1525651200,,202,5.090909090909091
8591611,2,B00DC6YEEM,"Maybe it got better. Sorry, but watch this and then watch Anthony Quinn in Barabbas.  Billy Zane is a good looking guy. yes. But how does he stay so well groomed in those days? I can't watch these new takes on great movies. They just don't stand up.",1524960000,,249,4.1875
8591612,5,B00DC6YEEM,This is a 5 star performance from ALL of the actors in this version and the story is great. Zane is AAAAAAAAAA++++++++ as always and I could  watch it over and over. Hard not to enjoy this.,1524873600,,189,4.108108108108108
8591613,4,B00DC6YEEM,"after watching the first episode, i must say it's a well made movie. really surprised me. the film quality , the script, fictionalized story line, casting, acting and sets are done fairly well,and has elements that make a lot of sense to this christian. Set in the time of the ministry of Christ, and interwoven with it, with some scenes of historical Biblical events as imagined by the movie makers.
Barabbas is portrayed as quite a nasty rogue, hard but not incorrigible. other characters such as the pious Judaeans including his bought and paid for pretty little slave girl... arrogant hard hearted Pilate, and his questing wife who is becoming a christian.... well acted. i will watch the rest of the series and so far, time well spent.",1524182400,,740,4.7890625
8591614,5,B00DC6YEEM,"This is my favorite Biblical movie along with The Gospel of John.  Billy Zane does a wonderful job or portraying one who really wants to believe but constantly is letting his human side get in the way.  Each little moment he falls down, but gets up, keeps trying to Strive, to Understand, and eventually comes to his Victory. Billy should do more of these.",1523836800,,356,4.546875
8591615,5,B00DC6YEEM,Excellent movie - not Biblical but excellent nonetheless.,1523577600,,57,6.25
