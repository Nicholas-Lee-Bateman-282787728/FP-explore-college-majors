2638557,5,B000HKCSTY,"Beginning Banjo gives you almost 2 hours of lessons. The instructors

pace was not too fast for me so you should be able to follow him pretty

well. Once he plays the songs for you, he breaks it down for you into

sections with explanations of his techniques. The instructor starts

with the basics of Banjo playing; tuning, scales and basic chords. you

also learn techniques like rolls, hammer-ons and pull-offs. I like the

bonus section the best because that has all of the lessons in a library

sort of format that you can flip through as you need to. This  DVD

reference library feature should be plenty to get you going considering

it was about 60-70 pages long and had many songs such as: Fireball

Mail, Bile Them Cabbage Down, Worried Man's Blues, Liza Jane, Cripple

Creek and more. I would consider the DVD well worth the price.",1176940800,26,842,4.577181208053691
2638558,2,B000HKCSTY,"Luckily I checked this out at the library and didn't spend any real money on it.  I'm a BEGINNING Banjo player and this DVD goes way too fast and assumes way to much for the true beginner.  From the start, Siegel does not explain the various fundamentals he's using in the DVD.  Just trying to follow along in Right Hand Patterns section is aggravating because he doesn't tell you what string numbers he's hitting or even slows it down enough for you to follow along.  I got 15 minutes into this DVD and had to replay it numerous times to try and follow along with what he's doing.  If you've been playing for a year or two and know this stuff up front you might be ok with the fast pace, but for a new beginner this DVD is not for you.  I would recommend the Murphy Method long before I would Siegel's DVD for a beginner.",1393632000,,822,4.203821656050955
2638559,5,B000HKCSTY,My son has played many musical instruments & self taught himself the guitar & wanted to learn to play the banjo. This was very instructive for a beginner,1389571200,,153,4.5
2638560,2,B000HKCSTY,A very good dvd but I could not load down the tabs - when I contacted their website - NO Help and they didn't even know what to do but gave me another web site of theirs to order more material.  You can not load down any of their so called sheet music (tabs which you will need to practice with).  I would suggest that you find another resourse than you can retrieve the tab sheet instead of this dvd..  Good money wasted!,1377820800,,422,4.0602409638554215
2638561,3,B000HKCSTY,Should be a good resource for learning to play the banjo - but will have to see if it really helps,1371513600,,98,3.7142857142857144
2638562,4,B000HKCSTY,I'm a beginning banjo player so the instrument is new to me.  I like the book and it helping me to get better playing the banjo.,1369440000,,128,3.923076923076923
2638563,5,B000HKCSTY,"I first found Avram's instructions online when I bought my first banjo. I really liked his mild manner and the way he broke things down, so I ordered the DVD and I love it.
The only thing that it's missing is a section of Tablature for the high breakdown in Cumberland Gap, but the DVD covers this section nicely so you will still be able to figure it out.
If Avram released a follow up DVD, I would by it in a second flat.
I started playing with ZERO exerience, and still haven't had a lesson from a person, yet I can play 5 or more diddys off this DVD set.
If you're a banjo noob: Get it, you won't regret it!",1368835200,7,611,4.016393442622951
2638564,4,B000HKCSTY,"I think this is a pretty good DVD, however I am not in any way musically gifted, and found it progressed a little fast for me.  I think a person that had an inkling of an ear or had played guitar or banjo before would be well pleased with it.  As for me, I will still play it, just for the music, and maybe someday some of it will seep into my arthritic hands.",1358899200,,360,3.8513513513513513
2638565,4,B000HKCSTY,I received this DVD on time and in good shape.  I gave it as a gift so don't know how helpful or well done it is for instruction.,1262995200,,129,3.607142857142857
2638566,5,B000HKCSTY,I knew someone dead set on playing the banjo. I stressed learning the guitar instead because the banjo seemed a great deal more difficult with the fingerpicking and metal picks on your fingers and all. I figured if this is what they want to learn then I will get them something to get them going. I suggested this DVD and I was surprised with the positive feedback on the gift.  they seemed to pick up some of the techniques pretty good and they liked the amount of content in the DVD compared to another one they picked up. So I would recommend this DVD.,1212796800,16,555,4.336538461538462
2638567,1,B000HKCSTY,"You should get something else, this dvd was done in one take, lot's of use of the word um. There's better free lessons on youtube.",1200441600,5,130,4.24

8140140,3,B000HKCSTY,A bit fast paced for beginners like me.,1460937600,,39,4.0

8140146,1,B000HKCSTY,This is not for beginners. Talks too fast. Needs to repeat what he is trying to teach several times. I could not learn the banjo with this. Very disappointed.,1409961600,,158,4.482758620689655
8140147,5,B000HKCSTY,Well worth the  money.  There are not too many 5string banjo books out there. Thank you for offering this for sale.,1400544000,,115,4.428571428571429
