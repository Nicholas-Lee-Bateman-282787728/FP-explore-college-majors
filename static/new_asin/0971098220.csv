173606,2,0971098220,"This DVD is 30 minute live vinaysa flow class taught by this guy.  That's it. Nothing more - no extras. Nothing.

For me, someone who has practiced yoga for two years I learned absolutely nothing from this DVD.

I have no problem with someone who wants to spend $100 on producing a DVD then sell them for $15 each.  My issue is with the title ""Athletic Power."" The only relation to ""Athletic Power"" is that he calls yogi's athletes in his 30 minute level 1 vinaysa class.

For someone who wants to follow a standard (but short) flow class this DVD is ok (there is nothing challenging but nothing dangerous on this DVD).  Except could have easily fit four 30  minute classes on one DVD ...my guess is that he chooses to put four 30 minute classes on 4 DVDs and give each one of them different misleading titles.

He also does no yoga himself on this DVD so one can't get a sense of the teachers level.",1124150400,19,900,4.315476190476191
173607,4,0971098220,"I have the 2004 ""Journey Into Power Level 2"" and this 2001 DVD seems very similar, albeit a shortened version.  I just got this DVD yesterday and did it for the first time, and that's exactly what it seems like to me.  It's easier than the ""Power Level 2"" one, there are way fewer poses.  I did like it, and I think it will be good for someone pressed for time, or someone who is somewhat fit and just starting Yoga.  But I would recommend the 2004 ""Journey Into Power Level 2"" over this one, for a really challenging workout.  I will do this one when I'm pressed for time, but will reach for the ""Level 2"" DVD on most days.

I was fairly fit before starting Yoga a few months ago, which helps, as Yoga is NOT easy, but do have lower back problems, some lumbar arthritis, but these practices seem to help me a lot with it, not harm it at all.",1116028800,29,842,4.103658536585366
173608,2,0971098220,"Luckily I rented this out on netflix. The title really intrigued me. I am always looking to connect biomechanics in all types of exercise. Let me state I am a beginning to intermediate level yoga practitioner. I teach T'ai Chi and Qi gong, So I am not a newbie in the internal arts by any means. I also teach boxing aerobics and play sports.

I figured this would explain how the yoga moves can ""unlock"" your athletic potential. Not hard to imagine how I came to that idea. There is absolutely NO mention of how yoga can do this. This is an advanced yoga practice for seasoned yoga practitioners. When he says ""athlete"" he doesn't mean an athlete like a baseball player or marathon runner. He means advanced YOGI. My wife is a Yoga instructor. She thought it was a great workout. She has been doing Yoga for 8-9 years. One positive thing I can say is.....it is interesting to watch Baron Baptiste conduct his class. I like how he went around and corrected people in a very encouraging way. Though I thought it was very distracting to try to follow along while he was walking around a class full of students. But that didn't seem to bother my wife.

To sum it up! There are no specific instructions to unlock your athletic power. I would say this title was contrived to sell tapes to a non yoga audience without having the content of the tape communicate effectively to that audience.",1112486400,56,1383,4.50597609561753
173609,5,0971098220,"I have all of Baron Baptiste's vhs and dvd workouts, and this is the best. Although it's too short for my practice, just under 30 minutes, it is demanding. I practice power yoga 6 days a week, and this dvd is in my machine at least half of those days. If you like crow pose, and jumping into plank, this is the dvd for you. For a real workout, I like to do this dvd and then another longer one like Soul of Strength, or Power Yoga: The Ultimate Challenge (Level 3 - last in a series of 3).",1093392000,50,489,3.9494949494949494
173610,4,0971098220,"In general a great tape. It is only 25 minutes, and concentrates on the sun salutaions and a lot of streching for the hips. I use this at the end of a workout, and I feel great afterwards. I don't use this tape as my whole workout. If you are looking for a head to toe workout using Yoga, go for one of Baron's hour long tapes.",1001894400,4,327,3.8955223880597014
173611,5,0971098220,"At about 25 minutes this my favorite tape for days I'm pressed for time or also want to the treadmill.  This tapes packs alot in a short time.  After a few sun salutes, you move to loosening those hips.  I store alot of tension there, from walking, sitting. You name it. These poses really stretches you out.  Then you do a few ""core"" poses and finally a twist and corpse pose.  I do this tape 2-3x's a week.  I never get bored with it and always sweat!  This would be a great addition to your library.",996019200,3,502,4.166666666666667
173612,5,0971098220,This DVD was recommended to me by a friend. I absolutely love the way I feel after I use it. It works as a workout or as a great stretch after a hard run!,1239580800,,154,3.5588235294117645
173613,5,0971098220,This DVD is perfect for a day after a long run!  It stretches every area possible that tightens up after a distance run.  Love it!!,1237161600,,131,4.2
173614,5,0971098220,"I had a chance to take one class with Baron a couple of years ago and it was a great experience, he is very engaging and personable, so I wanted to got a video or two by him. (If you ever have a chance to take a class with him, do so.  He is alot of fun.)

This DVD has a a routine that is one that is leads you through a set of moves that will warm you up and lossening your muscles (Sun Salutation, Warrior) and then continues on with poses that really help develop strength and your abdominals.  Boat Pose is one I love and always find that it is one that really develps my strength.

The routine is just shy of a half hour with some parts a bit more challenging to me than others, but his expert advice and tips help me along.",1230681600,2,730,3.9121621621621623
173615,5,0971098220,Athletic Power is challenging and really opens up your hips. He is easy to listen to. I feel like I've done a workout when I am finished. I have core yoga too and that's fantastic as well.,1200268800,,188,4.108108108108108
173616,5,0971098220,"This is a fantastic form of yoga, which focuses on traditional postures.  This DVD is a fantastic way to become introduced to the practice.  I also purchased Core Power and Unlocking Athletic Power, both of which are great.  Within 3 weeks I felt stronger, thinner, and with less joint and muscle pain.  I've always been a big fan of yoga, but had not considered a practice with DVDs until the Baron Baptiste videos were suggested to me.  I'm glad I gave it a chance, and expect that I will be using these DVDs for years to come.",1179014400,,529,4.412371134020619
173617,5,0971098220,"About myself:

I'm into Yoga since about six years.

I practice dayly.

I also teach Power Vinyasa Yoga at a local Hotal Spa Fitness Studio.

I personally like fluid and complete physically challanging Power Yoga Routines.

Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that!

About the DVD: You can't do a 60 to 80 Minutes Training every day, and this is for the days in between.

It's a great short Workout that leaves you warm and energized. Even though it is short it is still physically demanding.

Baron is a great teacher! He honors every aspect of Yoga and encourages his students in a professionel an gentil way. (Although he seems to overdue it just a little from time to time with sayings like: ""Angels fly because they take themselves lightly"". Come on Baron! But to me that makes him even more sympathic. Obviously he is so much into Yoga that he looses it just a little from time to time ;-))

The routine is fluid and round.

It is suited for all Practicioners from Beginner (meaning you already took some Yoga lessons and know the main poses) to advanced.

I highly recommend it!

I hope this was helpfull for you!

Namast!",1167782400,7,1155,4.548543689320389
173618,5,0971098220,"It is similar to Baron's ""Journey Into Power Level 1"", with the exception of not as much core/ab focus towards the end. This is fine with me because this is not what I am needing in a 30 minute yoga routine. The sequence and pace of the postures is just my type of thing.

I love doing this particular DVD before I have to get ready for work, especially when I'm tired and not feeling up to par this gets me feeling better on so many levels.

I enjoy Baron's style of instruction better than anyone else I've experienced on DVD or real life.",1162080000,7,541,4.1923076923076925
173619,4,0971098220,"Unlocking Athletic Power is one of the three videos from Baron's Live! series. Like in the other two practices in this series, Baron leads a large class through the postures, moving thruogh the participants to make adjustments and offer encouragements. The video is described as being for all levels, and some of the class members do perform modified versions of the postures, but there are also some more advanced postures included as described below.

As with all of his videos, Baron begins with sun salutations, moving from the A to the B series. He ends the latter with crow pose, an arm balance--a surprisingly challenging posture for this early in the practice. Next comes a warrior series with plenty of form pointers for where you should be feeling the work. Baron then moves into a series of hip openers, beginning with crescent pose and proceeding to lunge with forearms on floor, pigeon, and double pigeon; a variation on boat pose follows before moving on to the other side. Then it's down to the floor for bridge and wheel (a full backbend which is optional). Baron then throws in a few moves for the abdominals before moving into the final stretches, including dead bug, cobbler's pose, table, lying twist, and savasana. The actual practice is about 26 minutes long, but the music continues for another 2 minutes, allowing you to easily remain in relaxation pose for a longer period.

Overall, I thought this was a nice intermediate practice. It is longer and more challenging than Baron's Core Power (although obviously not as core-focused) but also shorter and not as advanced as his longer Live practice, Soul of Strength. I would recommend UAP for experienced yogis looking for a strong, powerful vinyasa yoga practice.",1145059200,,1738,4.948630136986301

7794319,5,0971098220,"I developed plantar fascia (severe heel pain) while training for my first marathon. Because I kept up the intense (read insane) training to get ready for the marathon, I let it get so bad I was limping for 1 month before the marathon and 2 months after - even though I had stopped running. All that limping caused bursitis in my hip.

After the marathon, I waited 3 months to see a Sports Specialist. He told me to quit running. I did quit running for 9 months - and my injury did not get any better. Every time I tried to run, I would come back limping. Out of desperation I picked up 'Unlocking Your Athletic Power' and started doing it on a daily basis. It targets all of the trouble spots experienced by many athletes: hips, low back, hamstrings, and calves. It's only 30 min. long which made it easy to fit into my schedule, yet still do a whole lot of good.

I credit doing this DVD and seeing a chiropractor with finally getting me back up and running. I went on to run the marathon 3 more times and am currently training for my 5th. I can't recommend this DVD highly enough!",1290124800,2,1082,4.273170731707317
