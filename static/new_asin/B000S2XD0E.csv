2879437,4,B000S2XD0E,"As stated in other reviews, there should be no expectation from animation fans that this DVD is meant to be a sequel to the original classics. This DVD is what I would call 2 morality/life lesson tales aimed at children, presented in such a way that it is entertaining for them to watch. Disney has done a great job of keeping the characters looking like they did in the originals; however, I really do question the vocal choice for Aurora. Ilene Woods is a tough act to follow, but surely they could have found a girl who matched her better. The current choice has a pleasant enough speaking voice, but when she sings, there is a definite disparity between the two. Still, most children will not notice these things and will be very entertained by the plots that are sprinkled with humor aimed at their age level. Some might miss the addition of a villain or two, but with each of the 2 stories being less than half an hour, it probably would have added to the length of the show. It's actually somewhat heartwarming to have these classic characters presented in such a simple way; the ""you must do things the hard way"" lesson is probably easier for children to relate to when the overall plot is not convoluted with villians. The marketing is also spot-on for this; this DVD is about 2 princesses, so do not expect to see Aladdin at all, or the Genie. Prince Phillip makes a cameo in the Aurora episode, but he has no real place in the plot. The extras are nice (especially the music video with Belle from Beauty and the Beast) and the previews really make one wish that ""Enchanted"" was being released sooner! Bottom line: great video that your children could watch safely alone, or with a parent and then discussed afterwards.",1189123200,7,1729,4.544871794871795
2879438,5,B000S2XD0E,"It is always refreshing and exciting to see your favorite Disney Princesses in a new movie! Sure, some of the direct to DVD movies Disney has put out have had a lack of good animation or writing but since Cinderella III, A Twist In Time the latest direct to DVD Disney releases have been great!
Join Aurora in a new story since the original Sleeping Beauty. In the first movie she practically slept through the whole thing but in this movie we get to know her personality and she is very funny!

In Jasmines story she is almost like a modern day politician!
""I want to build a new wing for the orphanage or a hospital and help the poor!"" Jasmine says. She should run for president yay!

The message in the DVD is great for any Prince or Princess in training, never give up on your dreams!

Filled with old favorites and new songs this Princess DVD will leave you feeling like royalty.

Can't wait for the next DVD of this collection!!",1188950400,5,934,4.381502890173411
2879439,3,B000S2XD0E,"Disney Princess DVDs take a new turn with ""Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams."" This 56 minute program, the first in a new DVD line, does something totally different: it offers entirely new and fully animated content. Finally, people get what they originally wanted and expected from the Disney Princess Collection DVDs. This disc features two all new animated stories starring Princess Aurora from ""Sleeping Beauty"" and Princess Jasmine from ""Aladdin."" What's more, Disney doesn't take advantage of the all-new animation by false advertising. They make no attempt to call this a ""sequel"" or ""Aurora Meets Jasmine,"" (they don't interact, by the way, so don't have a geek-gasm), though ""Tales of Perseverance"" would have made more sense than ""Follow Your Dreams."" I suppose the latter is more appealing to the younger set though.

The program starts rather abruptly, as the closest thing there is to any opening credits are part of the main menu. To explain, as the DVD menu is kicked up for the first time, a proper English narrator introduces you to a magical castle in which a very special book is kept. The book is full of stories of Disney Princesses (and Mulan), sans the lovely Eilonwy (hmph), and when you select Play (or if you are simply entrusting Fast Play with full power), it immediately turns to a page featuring Aurora. The page comes alive, as Aurora greets the viewer and begins to talk about perseverance leading into the first story, ""Keys to the Kingdom.""

In ""Keys to the Kingdom,"" Princess Aurora is left in charge of the land for two days while her parents, along with Prince Phillip and King Hubert, are away at a conference. Left in charge, she is determined to do everything well and on her own, no matter how long it takes. However, when the princess must send the three good fairies away with a speech King Hubert mistakenly left behind, Merryweather leaves her magic wand with Aurora in case she needs help. As the workload of signing papers and hearing villagers' grievances gets out of hand, Aurora finally does turn to the wand with disastrous results. One mistake leads to another, and Aurora soon decides she will have to find a way to solve the problems she has created on her own.

After some closing comments from Aurora, the book turns pages again and we are introduced to Princess Jasmine. She begins her tale, ""More Than a Peacock Princess,"" which is about Jasmine wanting a more important role in the kingdom. Her father sets her up with a teacher's assistant gig, and Jasmine is quite excited about it, but this quickly goes bad as the students simply have no respect. Of course, she turns this around by the end of the story, thanks to the events that follow involving the royal family's beloved horse, Sahara. The horse belonged to Jasmine's mother who was the only one he would allow to ride him, so he is a very special animal to the sultan, if a disagreeable one. Sahara escapes one day though, and his young keeper (a grade-school Aladdin lookalike) is distraught. His family depends on the money he earns by keeping the horse. It's all up to Jasmine to retrieve Sahara before Sultan knows the horse is gone.

Well, enough with the synopsis. Let's talk about how good this program really is. For starters, this is better than expected, in my opinion. Of course, I'm constantly surprised by the complaints of consumer after consumer who is frustrated when they buy a direct to video release that isn't at the same quality level of a theatrical release. I guess I have come to know what to expect. So, when I say this is better than expected, I am comparing it to past releases of the kind. The animation is pretty darn good for a direct-to-video non-feature. I mean, I was expecting something in the vein of the Aladdin TV series, but this was better than that. Not in terms of the writing, but in terms of the animation. And, while the characters weren't always on model to the extent one hopes, they did a fairly decent job, as with the backgrounds. Of course, the bigger shock to the senses throughout is Aurora's story, as this is our first time to see an Aurora story since her feature film back in the 1950's. This makes the drop in art quality more disturbing. In addition to that, none of the voices are the same and Aurora's is extremely different. In Jasmine's case, you have the original voices and we're used to seeing her in varying qualities on the TV series and DVD sequels. As for the writing, and you should really pay attention for this part, this program is really strongly targeted at small children. There are those out there who don't realize how many teen and adult fans these characters have. For those of us in that older category, realize before you buy that these DVDs are made for little kids. That's hardly something to complain about, either. Yes, I wish they made more animated programs aimed at the whole family, in true Disney tradition, but I also wish Disney Channel had this type of stuff running in its Playhouse Disney line-up rather than so many computer animated shows and other stuff. Disney is focusing its direct-to-video content on preschooler titles, and I'm just glad they are able to squeeze a few classic character subjects into that model. Think of this as a modern take on the old Jiminy Cricket shorts. They were made to teach little kids too, and the animation wasn't exactly ""Pinocchio"" quality. The thing that probably makes these a little harder to enjoy is that the princesses are overly sweet throughout and talk down to the audience in the intros since they are intended to be talking to little ones. But, getting on with discussing the writing, the first story is a cutesy story that is about on the level of something from ""Cinderella 2,"" if not a tad better. That's the dreaded 2nd film, not the much loved 3rd. Make what you want out of that. I feel that those stories would have been better received if they had been released in a format more like this one. At least this one doesn't have those horrible pop songs. There ARE songs in these stories though, but they're none too special and in the vein of ""Cinderella 3."" Yeah, that's the better one. There's also a new character in the Aurora story called the Duke, and he is supposed to be comic relief but isn't very successful at it. Perhaps he's funnier to little kids. Still, the Aurora story is tolerable because the visuals are better than TV animation, it's the first animated Aurora story in decades so it's a treat for Aurora fans, and magic wand play is always entertaining. And, of course, Aurora is a hottie. So is Jasmine when she's drawn right though, and her story is the more adventurous one. Not sure I'm going to side with the other opinions I've heard and say I like it better, as I enjoy the magic of the first, but the Jasmine tale is stronger overall with its story and songs, and one Jasmine bath scene, ha. Unfortunately, there is no appearance by Aladdin and the Genie in this one. It's just Jasmine, Abu, Iago, Rajah, Carpet, the Sultan and the guards, plus some new characters. And, while Jasmine's story is more adventurous, it doesn't come close to the material from the ""Aladdin"" animated series.

Naturally, these stories are great for kids, and there's nothing scary in them if you're one of THOSE parents. Not a villain to be seen. It's all kept very cutesy and unthreatening. Definitely, the main reason to buy this is if you have kids or if you're a Disney completist, but please don't buy this expecting a feature film, especially not a theatrical quality one. It's two kid-aimed stories about two Disney princesses meant to teach perseverance. The animation quality is good compared to TV stuff, but it's not feature quality. For the sort of product it is though, it's about right. If you know what to expect, you may be happy with your purchase or know to avoid it, but you can't get them for false advertising this time around.

Extra Features: These are hardly worth mentioning, but I will anyway. In addition to trailers for other stuff, you get two games and a music video. Actually, the music video IS worth mentioning. It's a Belle music video that also features all new animation (from an upcoming release in this line of DVDs). The song is called ""You'll Never Lose This Love,"" and the release is to be called ""Enchanted Tales: Kingdom of Kindness."" That is, if Lasseter doesn't pull the plug on this DVD line, as I heard he was supposed to have done already. As for the games, they are very short and can't have much replay value. One is an Aurora Dress Up game, the other is a Find Sahara game. You probably will only play each of these once, but I don't know how kids would feel about them.",1188864000,61,8716,4.64549578742709
2879440,5,B000S2XD0E,"I had the opportunity to attend a special screening of Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams.  This is the first release in this new Princess series which features Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Jasmine from Aladdin.  The tales are told in two different segments but are linked by the theme of Perseverance.  For those who may have grown up loving these films (or who have children who adore these characters), it was wonderful to see how much care was taken to deliver such detailed and nuanced animation in this direct-to-DVD release.

  Princess Aurora shows the importance of never taking the easy way out and being proud of one's own efforts, while Jasmine asserts that even a princess needs to do something challenging with her life.  Both stories are told in a humorous fashion and the whimsical new songs, Keys To The Kingdom & More Than A Peacock Princess, should not disappoint.  The original singing voice of Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, Lea Solonga, also returns to make this a special treat.

  This truly exceptional entry into the Disney Princess canon sends a very empowering message.  If you can truly believe in your own abilities, GREATNESS CAN BE ACHIEVED!",1186790400,38,1193,4.96969696969697

2879449,4,B000S2XD0E,"I started out searching for a Disney Princess Sing-Along video, but found this video instead. It contains two wonderful stories about perseverance, and not giving up.

The first tale is of Princess Aurora, who is given the responsibility of running the kingdom for the first time. Merriwhether, the fairy, gives her a magic wand for 'just in case' and Princess Aurora learns how important it is not to take shortcuts, but to persevere through it.

The second tale is of Princess Jasmine, and at the beginning her duties are mostly just for show. She wants more important responsibilities around the kingdom. It's not as easy as she thought it would be and must overcome feelings of insecurity.

My daughter and I have watched these two stories many times over. It makes me smile when she is working through something that's frustrating and says, ""I can't give up."" I know she learned it from these fun Disney stories.",1398643200,,917,4.828025477707007

My primary like is the moral encouragement for perseverence in both stories.  From the point of view of a two year old (as much as I can see it), both animated stories were simple but bright and lively with a great message.

I recommend this series as good basic values/wisdom for aspiring princesses in this range (about 2 to 6).  It is a great relief from the glamed-up, sexed-up, worldliness and scarry stuff found in many kids DVDs.",1387065600,,608,4.4818181818181815

2879460,5,B000S2XD0E,"While a lot of Disney animated DTV titles are nothing more than ""sequels and prequels""  this title gives us two heartwarming tales from two of Disney's favorite princesses Aurora and Jasmine.  Aurora makes her first animated appearance since the classic Sleeping Beauty ;  the story follows Aurora as she gets ""the keys to the kingdom"" and performs all the task that her mother and father would do. (everyone went to a royal conference but Aurora) .  Aurora does a great job but when things a little tough for her she uses a little magic provided via left behind fairy wand, will Aurora fix everything before the King and Queen arrive back ?  With charming songs and alluring music this is sure to be a favorite for your little Sleeping Beauty.

In the second half of the movie Princess Jasmine takes the reigns with her story.  The animation in this story is perhaps closer to or better than the original film, but it definitely out shines that of the both Aladdin sequels.  The music is not Alan Menken style  or up to par with the original but the songs are indeed catchy and fun to hear, the music is also a subtle treat if you listen closely .  Jasmine being fed up with her daily duties ( camel shows, cutting ribbons at carpet shops and having paintings of herself done ).  She feels she is ""more than a peacock princess"" and asks her father for a more challenging role to help out with.
The Sultan lets her help her cousin as Royal Assistant Educator.  The day does not go as planned or as well as she would have hoped but she decides to go back.  Elsewhere on the palace grounds we find that the Sultan takes an apple to his beloved wife's horse Sahara , (whom only she could ride, let alone get close to. )  We meet a young boy named Hakeem who is a stable worker, (also he looks ironically identical to a very young Aladdin, who btw is nowhere in this story nor is Genie ! )  The following day Jasmine finds that her mothers favorite horse is missing and goes in search of it. When she sees finds Sahara its a task that will take all of determination as she sings "" I won't give up""  ...  Two refreshing stories that will capture your love for these two leading ladies all over again,  music that is pleasing to the ears, and animation that is just as well done as the originals.

This titles is for young children of all ages and for any older girls who loved being a princess.  The stories teach lessons of never giving up, and perseverance .  The film gets 5 stars because both stories are original and the songs and music are very catchy. The sound and picture are also very nice and we get to see what would have been of the series in a sing along song with Belle from Beauty and the Beast called "" You'll never loose this love""  which was a story that was in development until cancelled by the wonderful John Lassetter .  (2D animation killer MHO)
We also are treated to see what would have become of two stories of two more princesses.  Cinderella and Mulan .
Also we are treated to another preview of the original trailer for this series which was called ""Kingdoms of Caring""
The stories in there focused on Belle and Aurora.

This is a wonderful title and deserves much more respect that it get.  If you have any love for the Disney Princesses you owe it to yourself to at least give this a rental shot,  I don't think you will be left disappointed.",1375747200,,3369,4.357371794871795

2879487,5,B000S2XD0E,"Disney Princess Enchanted Tales is a 2007 Disney DVD and was a proposed series of DVD's starring the widely-popular Disney Princesses. In this animated movie featuring Two of the Princesses, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Jasmine from Aladdin. The first story stars Aurora in her first Disney adventure since the 1959 classic, as Aurora is chosen to rule the castle when her parents go to a royal summit. At first she uses Merryweather's wand to make things easier but soon learns she must stay the course and make things right again. The second story stars Jasmine in her new Disney adventure since Aladdin and the King of Thieves. Jasmine has grown tired of living a life of royalty so she asked her dad, the Sultan, to find a job that means lot to her. And in an instant, Jasmine is a teacher at a Agrabah school but she learns it is not easy, but with some good advice for Aneesa, her personal handmaiden, Jasmine made it work for everyone. The special features includes music videos and sneak peeks of various Disney favourites like Enchanted, My Friends Tigger and Pooh Christmas and Little Einsteins Race to Space. Disney Princess Enchanted Tales is a rare DVD treat your children will enjoy. :)",1339027200,,1203,4.733333333333333
2879488,4,B000S2XD0E,"As another reviewer stated, there are only two 25 minute shorts.  There are songs, the great animation you expect from Disney, and of course, the fantastic voice actors.

Everything is typically Disney.  They are cute little Disney Princess stories, so don't rent or buy it for your child if you're looking for strong female role models.  (Read Robert Munsch's book ""The Paper Bag Princess"" instead.)

The stories are short, fast moving, and just enough to make a toddler happy.

We were pleased with this purchase.  Our two year old is still too young for the full length Disney movies, so this collection is perfect for her.  She gets her princess ""fix"" in two bite sized portions.  Long enough for Mommy to take a shower in peace.  Isn't that all a stay at home parent wants/needs?",1334188800,4,784,4.7407407407407405

Aurora takes the easy way out, then realizes the folly of her mistake. I did have a problem with the song in this one, there is a line that is vain, but it's been a while since I've seen it, so can't quote it. Not sure why the previous reviewer had a problem with Jasmine... maybe cause it has to do with a horse and all little girls are supposed to love horses? Or the fact she attempts to be a school teacher. I thought it was the better of the two, except the whole historically inaccurate thing (not the genie, but the female rights part, but we won't get into that). Anyway, Jasmine has to track down her mother's prize unbreakable horse before the sultan realizes it's gone and does something terrible to the stable boy (Now that's accurate!). By breaking the horse she realizes she can handle anything namely the unruly school children she wants to teach in an attempt to be more than a princess.",1325808000,2,1069,4.376884422110553

2879496,4,B000S2XD0E,"Other reviewers have given the snopsis of the two stories contained on this DVD, so I won't do it again.  I will say my children and I thoroughly enjoyed the stories, and laughed along the way and the animation was great.  That alone makes it better than many others out there.  The theme of this video is perserverance.  the give it's moral vein a lot of weight, so i wanted to dicuss it.  Perserverance is a great moral to have, especially when creating something as entertaining as this dvd, it is a great bonus.  The two stories did a great job explaining what could be a tough concept to children.  Especially in Aurora's story, she even made a mistake before finally succeeding, which is critical in explaing perserverance.  However, my problem lies in Jasmime's story.  I loved the song, very catchy, and the story was funny (the kids running the show at the school is soo true in my life!).  But she needlessly lies to her father at the end of her story. she covers up and concels the good deed she has done (not in an attempt to be humble either).  that negates any affect her persererance had.  i have to discuss this with my children each time they watch it so they know that it is not okay to lie.  i really don't know why disney put that in there.  it serves no purpose, it doesn't further the story in any way.",1291334400,2,1324,4.372950819672131
2879497,5,B000S2XD0E,"My 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter both LOVE this movie. I see a lot of reviews complaining that the DVD is geared for a younger audience but that is exactly what I've been trying to find.

Last summer my daughter saw a princess Sleeping Beauty baby doll in the park and suddenly was obsessed with my Disney classic collection. I let her watch them with me but had to fast forward and skip the scary parts and Cinderella was the only film I could let her sit all the way through! I started buying the princess DVD's so my just turning toddler could indulge her infatuation with pretty princesses and flowing dresses. Unfortunately all of those movies were about Jasmine and Ariel, and not the feisty, brave characters from the movies, but whining, selfish, outspoken, and rude little versions that seemed geared towards bratty teens who share their angst issues with these ""princesses."" Teenagers have the Disney channel, Hannah Montana, Wizards etc. They don't want to see the princesses and I was beginning to realize that the the Disney princess line was being herded toward teenage allowance money in the area of video games, barbie dolls and sexed up concepts.

Luckily for us Disney FINALLY stepped in and saved the Princess legacy. This DVD actually appeals well to the little girls who are loving the new baby princess dolls, the tea sets and the new princess dress up and bath time play lines.

The Animation matches the quality you'll find in Cinderella III, a twist in time. I don't mind it and the babies love the color and attention to detail that was given to the film. Case in point, the animated sequence for the song ""Keys to the Kingdom"" is done impeccably and the artsy feel of the 1951 original is placed secondary to the modern story but it's there just the same. The backgrounds in the first story are beautiful and the princess has been given the leading role this time. The first story opens with the kings, queen and the the prince leaving for a conference and leaving Aurora ""in charge"" for two days. She learns that the job is much more difficult than she first believed but the moral to the story ultimately maintains that by doing a job right the first time and avoiding the easy way out you will succeed. A perfect lesson for girls today and who better to deliver that lesson than Mom with the help of a pretty and graceful princess?
The second story shows Jasmine as a young woman dissatisfied with being a ""Peacock Princess"" which is yet another fun and well produced song sequence. Jasmine convinces her father to give her ""important"" jobs, but learns that perseverance is more important than the job and that anyone can do anything if they believe and try again. I was much happier with this version of Jasmine. Another great song is ""Eyes on the Prize"" (I think that's the name) where Jasmine tries to bring her deceased mother's horse back to her father. She is vivacious and as pretty as she was in Aladdin, she also has a main role. We get to see the same brave and spirited character we learned to love in the film instead of the spoiled, ""arm candy"" of the recent Princess story collections.
The bonus disk includes a ""sneak peak"" of The Princess and the Frog, which is more what we're going to find on the special features portion of the up and coming DVD release. You can find six minutes of actual footage for The Princess and the Frog on the Diamond release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The disk also includes two songs, one by Cinderella and one by Mulan.

Overall I would purchase this again and I'm planning to gift this to other little princesses in my life. I'm looking forward to further installments and highly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a film for young princesses.",1266796800,,3757,4.586309523809524
2879498,5,B000S2XD0E,"My almost 3 yr old and 4 yr old daughters love this movie.  I love it too because it is something I can let them watch while I make dinner - no scary parts (like so many of the Disney movies -- no scary witches here casting evil spells).  I also like that it is much shorter than a regular movie.

Just a nice simply story and cute songs, while they still can adore Princess Aurora -- their favorite princess of all.  And of course Jasmine, too.  It definitely has that dream-like quality to it, as well, which captivates them.

I also really like that it is a more contemporary princess movie -- a stronger female model (not just about a girl falling in love and being whisked away by a prince).  But, for example, the Princess Aurora story is about Aurora taking care of all the responsibilities of the castle while her parents have to go to a conference.  (ie, not that she is just sitting around for prince charming to make her life happily ever after).  And I think my daughters think it is neat because to them, it is like they get an ""inside glimpse"" of ""castle life"" and get to know Aurora and Jasmine more.",1266796800,2,1115,4.29665071770335

This limited edition DVD follows Princess Jasmine and Princess Aurora in a fun, musical filled adventure. Your little girl will learn that when you try to take shortcuts in getting a job done, you will end up with disaster and it will take more time and effort to fix the problems you made. I love the lesson that this teaches our children - something we are already trying to instill in our daughter.

What I do not like about the Princesses is that life is oftentimes centered around them rather than others. I want my daughter to be others centered not self centered. When you are others centered and you come last, you will have a joy and happiness that things can not give you.

2879505,4,B000S2XD0E,"After recently watching Sleeping Beauty for the first time on DVD I was curious to see if Disney ever revisited the story in animated form, which lead me to this Direct-to-DVD release in the Disney Princess DVD line. I avoided previous `Princess' entries which basically recycled episodes of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" animated series, but this Direct-to-DVD release promised all new animated productions.

The opening to Enchanted Tales featured a nice narrative touch that helped connect this Direct-to-DVD release to the storybook films of early Disney canon in which a narrator relates the events of the story by reading them from an actual story book.

Running approximately 56 minutes, this DVD features the first time the events of Sleeping Beauty have been revisited in fully animated form. While the lower-budget visuals of ""Keys to the Kingdom' lack the depth of the original film, this release shows striking effort to recreate the visuals of animator Eyvind Earle using modern techniques. It was great getting to revisit the world of Sleeping Beauty, but ultimatly `Keys to the Kingdon' felt like a segment of Cinderella II in it's simplicity. This may prove to be a good thing though as these new Enchanted Tales allow for more Character growth for Princess Aurora who really was underdeveloped during her original appearance in Sleeping Beauty. Hopefully her next appearance will prove to be a better adventure as Cinderella III was for that stories princess.

The real gem on this DVD for me was revisiting the Aladdin franchise. In ""More Than a Peacock Princess,"" the animators made a succeeding effort to improve the quality of animation. Overall the quality falls somewhere between the original film and its 3rd sequel. The one thing that stood out the most was how the animation for the Magic Carpet returned to its CGI roots. Carpet hasn't looked this good from since the first film. Some scenes also looked like they were lifted from the original film, such as Jasmine's bedroom, and the oasis where she finally tracks down her mother's horse. It felt like `More than a Peacock Princess' was trying to set itself aside from the poor animation seen in the television series.

All-in-all, when you take into consideration that this film was created solely for the Direct-to-DVD market the quality of animation is striking, and the simplicity of the plot is clearly a result of the target audience being that of little girls under the age of 8.

I think if you are aware of this prior to seeing this release you will be able to better appreciate Disney's effort, but if you go into this execting the quality of 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Aladdin' you will be left very dissapointed.",1235260800,,2703,4.971238938053097

These two stories of Aurora(Sleeping Beauty) and Jasmine(from Aladdin)are real cute little stories of what is a day or days in the life of a regular princess. These are their lives in happy ever after, we get to take a peek. There are no villains (no Maleficent, no Jafar).Both stories are cute, funny, simple to understand, have good short songs on them, and a moral or lesson to be learned in each one.

Both were made in the same artistic style of the respective feature films where we first saw these princesses. But I must point out that Jasmine's story is a little bland after seeing her in the Aladdin TV series and two other Aladdin movies where she had more of an action role. Aurora's story fits her like glove.

I highly recommend this DVD to all parents with young daughters who like Disney films (the main target audience for this direct to DVD release), (sorry, but boys won't like it, haha) and for the adults who wanted to see more of what the Disney studios can produce outside their feature film dept.

Some of the Aladdin tales have great stories envolving Jasmine that are just as good. As many of the other reviewer have said, this is a direct to video so I didn't expect the quality of theater released but for me it wasn't up to DVD release.
  Probably because it isn't a feature they ended up with only 55 minutes & 34 seconds of story including over 30 seconds of introduction to each of the 2 stories.  So the actual stories are 25 minutes and 30 minutes long.  In the VHS tapes of PRINCESS Collection you get 44 minutes and 2 stories.  I bought some of these at $9 when they came out and this DVD is comprable in quality and length. You can buy these VHSes still.  Just like this DVD, they are really for the younger crowd unlike the movies.
  As for the direct to video not being of good quality, most might not be theatrical quality but I really think there are some great ones out there like- The Lion King sequels, Patch's London Adventure, BB, the Enchanted Christmas, Aladdin King of Theives (though Jafar stunk, lacking Robin Williams), Winnie the Pooh sequels, Mickey's Once upon a Christmas, Brother Bear 2 (possibly better than the first), etc.. This film is not one of them.  It is up to TV quality, no better.
  For the $26.99 list retail and $20 average, now 17.95 on Amazon, this film should been either better quality, better stories, or more stories.  The extras, like many said, are not worth mentioning. I bought this for $18 and I don't think it is worth $9 unless your little one really likes the princesses.  Wait for price to come down.",1196985600,,1781,4.45679012345679

2879527,2,B000S2XD0E,"I did like both of these stories. They just seemed so quick to me. I paid 5 bucks to rent this movie. I think Disney went kinda cheapo on this one. They spit out two quick little cartoons,slap it in a box and call it a movie. I think they could have at least added  one more princess story in there.",1190332800,6,299,3.901639344262295
2879528,4,B000S2XD0E,"My girls (ages 2.5 and 4) love all the princesses so they love this video also, but we were rather disappointed in the games.  The Jasmine one isn't too bad (though after you've played through the three different paths there isn't any reason to do it again).  The Aurora one is more appealing to my kids - dressing up Princess Aurora, though you can't make a ""bad"" choice, you will be told that isn't a good choice and my biggest complaint is that you get to see the outfit you picked for her to wear for exactly 4 seconds!!!  What's up with that?  My girls want to look at her all dressed up, but she flashes by standing next to the table and that's all you see of her the whole game!  I give is four stars b/c my girls do enjoy the film, but the extras really aren't worth much.",1189555200,6,780,4.139072847682119
8204158,3,B000S2XD0E,"Nothing against Aurora, as I also really like her, but I've had a thing for Jasmine ever since I was 6 years old when I saw the original Aladdin film in theaters, so the few times I have watched this film so far, I have always skipped right to Jasmine's story, and I still haven't seen the first half of the film about Aurora except for two little bits. Compared to most of the other Disney Princesses, Jasmine really stands out. But enough of my fanboying. Her portion of this film is called ""More Than A Peacock Princess"", and it focuses on her trying to prove that she can be more than what she is. The plot was stupid, and the way the story progressed was ridiculous. But it did have a few merits. For one, it was nice that they got Lea Salonga to return as Jasmine's singing voice, and her singing is just as lovely as ever. I especially like the song ""I've Got My Eyes On You"". The animation is pretty decent, and looks very similar to the original 1992 film which is nice, and certainly looks better than that of the two Aladdin sequels. There are also some very beautiful shots of Jasmine that really capture her elegance. And it's great to see Linda Larkin still doing Jasmine's voice after all these years. I don't think I can imagine anybody other than her playing Jasmine as her voice is part of what makes Jasmine so great. Probably worth getting if you find it used for a couple of bucks like I did.",1503792000,,1413,4.315789473684211
