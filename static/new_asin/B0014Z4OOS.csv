3136206,5,B0014Z4OOS,We have been watching this for days now!  Loads of entertainment and full of that silly Pokemon-show fun.  Gotta love Team Rocket's persistence in the face of failure...,1212710400,,169,5.0
3136207,4,B0014Z4OOS,"I just purchased my copy of the set today.  I was glad to finally get my hands on it.  I am a thankful person when DVDs are released for the sole purpose that some shows stop releasing after a while or are not released at all.  So, that in mind, I will critique this on a purely fun point of view and not to seem unthankful in any way.

I'm curious first off about the changes between Discs 1 and Discs 2/3.  It almost seems like disc one was an earlier release.  I mean, there's a Pokemon 4ever trailer on it?  It's just weird.

However, I like the slim case idea.  I am a fan of the slimcases.",1211846400,,595,3.9745762711864407
3136208,4,B0014Z4OOS,"I've loved Pokmon since I was ten years old. And I just graduated college. I was very excited to hear that Viz would be releasing the Orange Islands episodes on one compact boxed set right after my graduation. My pokdar went off, with bells a ringing and those bells tolled ""Graduation Present! =D""

Excitedly I visited my local retailer to pick it up this morning and returned home with excited vigor. I tore open the packaging, which was actually more slimline than the recently released DVD boxed sets of the Indigo League seasons. This is good, more green friendly and space saving on the shelf and all that.

I popped the first DVD into my player and was appalled at what I saw. A simple still shot of Ash and party riding Lapras. That wasn't the problem. The problem was the fact that the image itself looked as if it had been hacked together in five minutes by a first-time Photoshop user. The edges of the image were very poorly done, in fact, parts of the image were cut off--namely Togepi's head and Pikachu's ear. They also felt it necessary to plop a Goldeen in there, which didn't even match the rest of the image.

""Ok,"" I thought, ""Calm Down. Its just the menu.""

No, it wasn't just the menu. The first three episodes of the first DVD were originally a part of the Indigo League seasons, and thus had the original Pokmon opening song attached to them. Most unfortunately, Viz felt it necessary to put the Orange Island opening song before the FIRST episode only, and then leaving the original opening transition screens intact with the first song. After those three episodes, the intros matched.

Then we come to the way that the menus on the DVD are actually set up. Selecting ""Play All"" from the DVD menu typically means that all episodes run in continuous sequence. Nay. Not this DVD set. Every time an episode comes to its end and this is the weird thing, ONLY after the third episode on the disk, the viewer is forced to select to play the next episode to start it.

Then we have the lack of intro and ending songs at each episode. My thought on this is that they cut the opening and ending songs at the beginning and end of each episode because they were trying to address the video compression quality issues that many people had complained about in past boxed sets.

The video quality is quite nice in this set (Note: being viewed on a 42 inch Sharp Aquos HDTV.), But I do miss the openings and endings. My only qualm (and it is being anal, I know but STILL) I wish they had matched the proper opening song to the proper episodes by including both opening and ending songs on the DVD.

One other thing I noticed that was different (not in that good way)is the disk art is exactly the same on every disk, except it says Disc 2 and 3 to differentiate.

Disk 2 so far is faring much better than the first disk. The menu image is MUCH better and looks slightly more like a professional DVD than a pathetic attempt at a Fan-made DVD. I mean, I've made DVD menus before and MINE looked more professional than the first disk's menu. That's pretty pathetic when you can say that about an official product. The issue that the first disk had seems to have been eliminated. Users are free to skip between episodes without being forced back to the episode selection menu. The Play All function works PERFECTLY, the opening and ending songs play at the beginning and ending songs play in their proper places in EVERY episode, and the video (while only SLIGHTLY compromised) looks pretty crisp and clean. Whoever did the second disk did a WAY better job than the hacks who did the first one.

This would have been a 5 star product had it not been for the shoddy DVD menu production and episode setup on the first disk, and as always, the complete and total lack of Japanese language tracks (We're still waiting, Viz.)

If you're trying like me to get Pokmon on DVD in its entirety, pick this up. It's got all 36 episodes of the Orange Islands arc, and the video is good. If weird DVD operations and menu organization on one of the disks and aesthetic properties don't bother you, 5 stars, pick it up NOW. You won't regret it. Its a good solid set, and you'll be that much closer to having all your Pokmon episodes on DVD. Enjoy, all! =)

3136219,5,B0014Z4OOS,I loooveeeee this series and was soooo happy to see it on here for such a decent price!!! I plan to buy alllll of the seasons! They don't all seem to be on here so I'll just have to wait and see but the case is cute. It's really high quality and the disks came in perfect condition so I have no complaints! It shipped pretty quickly too!,1452297600,,337,3.9705882352941178

3136221,5,B0014Z4OOS,"Between this release and the 2015; this one is much better than the two.  Though the menus were just a cut & paste of the Original 3 Separate Volume Releases, it's the same on the 2015.

What makes this set better than VIZ's release in 2015 is that:
This set still contains the episodes ""Stage Fight"" & ""Mandarin Island Miss Match"".  These two episodes were dropped from the 2015 set due to the usage of the Pokemon Jynx, prior to here ""Purple Skin"" change.

So for the Pokemon Fans out there who wish to have a COMPLETE Season 2 Set, this is the version you should get!",1451001600,,570,4.299065420560748

3136226,5,B0014Z4OOS,Great. All discs read well and clear,1437868800,,36,4.285714285714286
3136227,4,B0014Z4OOS,"This is the version of the Orange Island set that people need to buy, as it includes all 36 episodes, as it says on the top banner at the top.

This release from 2009 has the episodes ""Stage Fight"" and ""The Mandarin Island Miss-Match"" which both have been omitted from the recent 2015 re-release, due to the appearance of Jynx in both episodes, where she still has the old ""black-face"" look, instead of her ""purple-face"" look. It never occurred to Viz to use new versions of these episodes where the Japanese would use digital editing to alter the colour, or this practice could be done by Pokmon USA and they would just insert the existing dub, but alas they don't!

So to get all the episodes, including those two episodes, you'll need to get this 36 episode set from 2009. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars though is that the episodes are from the original Viz's releases and so therefore have 12 episodes on each disc, so the bitrate would be the same as some of those early Lionsgate ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" releases. They'll be watchable, but there maybe times where the low bitrate is noticeable.

Despite that though, this is the set to get and the best many of us will get to see the whole Orange Island saga of Pokmon.",1432944000,5,1244,4.447368421052632

3136323,5,B0014Z4OOS,"To anyone hesitating to buy the Pokemon DVDs here in the US, you might as well buy them because the only legal way to watch the original Japanese versions would require taking a citizenship test in Japan (The show is only available for rental in Japan). Regardless of my little quip, 4kids did their best to stay both faithful to the story and be family-friendly to Americans at the same time.

Now, I barely watched the whole first disc, but I'm going to spoil it a little: After receiving an interesting Pokeball that is unopenable, Brock stays behind with Prof. Ivy and Tracey joins the gang for the season. (Don't worry, Brock fans, Tracey does get removed at the end.) Ash competes against the Gym Leaders of the Orange Archipelago. Interesting stuff happens in between, sticking with the continuity of a regular Pokemon story\scenario.

The quality of the picture and sound is great. The stories are written out well for the quality you expect from both the Japanese (regarding visual) and American (regarding translation and synchronization to the pictures) writers.

To be less confused, Seasons 1-5 (Indigo League, Adventures on the Orange Islands, Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions and Master Quest) are what hardcore Pokemon anime enthusiast call the original series. (Back in Japan, the 5 seasons were part of one continuous which were titled ""Pocket Monsters"") I already have the rerelease of the first (Indigo League) and second (Adventures on the Orange Islands) seasons. I'm begging for The Pokemon Company to re-issue the 3rd, 4th and 5th seasons, or rather, I'm asking why there aren't rereleases of the season in question. I have bought nearly every Pokemon DVD since The first Advanced season. Why wouldn't the company rerelease the episodes is beyond me.

For those of you who love Pokmon, but haven't seen this series, I'd recommend picking it up. It's just as fun as the first series, but it does seem a bit hokey. It's more like a parody of Pokmon than an actual new season, with Team Rocket getting even more over-the-top, and Ash becoming a bit more stereotypically anime. It also has a feeling of watching Scooby-Doo, with crazy inane plots, total non-sequiturs and just generally weird stuff. Pikachu and Togepi get much more screen time, it seems like after every line the camera cuts to a close up on one of them, and as Pokmon, they don't have much to say.

That said, it was a very enjoyable season with all the fun and wackiness we've come to expect from Pokmon. Anyone who enjoyed the first series will love this one, and it's a great addition to your collection.",1276473600,,1047,4.309644670050761

It seems the loss of Brock hit the writers hard, and Tracy is sometimes half-Brock, secretly swooning over Super Jenny from Pinkan island (home to the pink pokemon) and Ultra Strong Joy who travels the Orange Islands on kayak. He's a bit more of a creeper, too. Brock was up-front about his love for attractive women, while Tracy mostly just sits back and draws them. He's no Brock, but likable nonetheless.

3136336,5,B0014Z4OOS,"With Pokemon now over 10 season's old, it is hard to imagine that there was a day where there was only just 150 Pokemon.

And Ash Ketchum was traveling with Misty and Tracy.

With Brock gone to live at Professor Ivy, Ash and Misty found themselves tempory alone until they bumped into Tracy, a Pokemon watcher.

Also Pikachu and Togepi are there with them all the way in this DVD series.

The second season of Pokemon was perhaps the shortest and Ash Ketchum was able to just go though 4 unique Pokemon gym battles where the rules apply to more than just battle, Ash also had to surf, build a Bobslead out of ice, and also this was the first time where double battles were used.

Adventures on the Orange Islands is for any old school Pokemon fan who always remembered the old Ash and Misty romance. Episodes like Misty meets her match and Where art thou Pokemon provide a few hints towards an Ash x Misty relationship.

And also even when Brock was not there trying to make his moves on all the girls, Tracy was a good replacement as intead of trying to pull the romantic moves on all the Nurse Joys and Officer Jennys he was instead drawing all the girls in his sketch book.

Tracy of course loves to draw pokemon in his sketch book and that is also the same when he loves to draw all the girls that he meets allong his journey to become a Pokemon Watcher and his ultimate dream is to some day work for the famous Professor Oak.

So for anyone who loves Pokemon but who does not want to watch a whole series of episodes where Ash works so hard to reach a certain Pokemon league competition only to be unlucky to be defeated, then this one is for you as The Orange Island series was short but worth full of good Pokemon nostaliga and Ash finally wins a Pokemon tornument in the Orange Islands in an amazing match against a powerful opponent.

3136337,3,B0014Z4OOS,"****Update for this previous review.  The only point I was trying to make in the past about the individual orange island dvd's is that the individuals provide more options (like captions).  I like dvd's with captions because you can't always tell, word for word, what a character is saying.  I like the older Pokemon dvd releases, such as the Master Quest box sets.  Those have captions.  Plus the dvd menu presentations are nicer.  If you are not picky about those things, then the Kanto (season 1) and Orange Island (Season 2) box sets will probably work out just fine.  Also getting them in bulk ""is"" cheaper and takes up less space on the shelf.  Being a Pokemon fan I am particular about things that other people can do without.*********  Update posted on June 25th 2013.

Ok I'll admit, I haven't seen this particular product.  But I have seen most Pokemon DVD's and I read one of the reviews, so I will say this:

When you compare the Orange Island DVD box sets and the Indigo box sets with the original releases, here is what you get:

1. Ever since the Master Quest box sets where finished Viz has been steering clear of offering English subtitles.  This is one feature the individual volumes almost always have.  Why do we need English subtitles?  Well I for one think that they are very helpful because sometimes we just don't understand what a person is saying and subtitles really clear that up.  I'm not joking!  We are not as nearly as good at understanding our own language as we pretend.  That's not to say that we are dence.

2.  The menu's are much nicer and cuter in the individual volumes than they are in the box sets.

3.  Sometimes in these new box sets the intros, themes, transitions, and endings get mixed up or left out completely.  One reviewer said it was because, the endings for example, somehow messes with the video quality.
That's stupid!  In all the endings I have seen, and I own just about all of the Pokemon DVD's, I have never noticed anything that takes away from the quality of the program.  And besides, if you don't want to watch the ending you can always push the ""Next Chapter"" button on your DVD remote to start the next episode.

Here is my suggestion for the Orange Islands.  Look up ""Pokemon Orange Islands"" in the Amazon search engine.  You will find the new box set and the individual volumes.  Buy the individuals!  Wether it is from Amazon themselves or from Amazon sellers (for a cheaper price).  It is well worth it!  I have the Individual Orange Island volumes myself and they are super fantastic!",1213920000,4,2554,4.567328918322295
3370703,5,B0014Z4OOS,We have been watching this for days now!  Loads of entertainment and full of that silly Pokemon-show fun.  Gotta love Team Rocket's persistence in the face of failure...,1212710400,,169,5.0
3370704,4,B0014Z4OOS,"I just purchased my copy of the set today.  I was glad to finally get my hands on it.  I am a thankful person when DVDs are released for the sole purpose that some shows stop releasing after a while or are not released at all.  So, that in mind, I will critique this on a purely fun point of view and not to seem unthankful in any way.

I'm curious first off about the changes between Discs 1 and Discs 2/3.  It almost seems like disc one was an earlier release.  I mean, there's a Pokemon 4ever trailer on it?  It's just weird.

However, I like the slim case idea.  I am a fan of the slimcases.",1211846400,,595,3.9745762711864407
3370705,4,B0014Z4OOS,"I've loved Pokmon since I was ten years old. And I just graduated college. I was very excited to hear that Viz would be releasing the Orange Islands episodes on one compact boxed set right after my graduation. My pokdar went off, with bells a ringing and those bells tolled ""Graduation Present! =D""

Excitedly I visited my local retailer to pick it up this morning and returned home with excited vigor. I tore open the packaging, which was actually more slimline than the recently released DVD boxed sets of the Indigo League seasons. This is good, more green friendly and space saving on the shelf and all that.

I popped the first DVD into my player and was appalled at what I saw. A simple still shot of Ash and party riding Lapras. That wasn't the problem. The problem was the fact that the image itself looked as if it had been hacked together in five minutes by a first-time Photoshop user. The edges of the image were very poorly done, in fact, parts of the image were cut off--namely Togepi's head and Pikachu's ear. They also felt it necessary to plop a Goldeen in there, which didn't even match the rest of the image.

""Ok,"" I thought, ""Calm Down. Its just the menu.""

No, it wasn't just the menu. The first three episodes of the first DVD were originally a part of the Indigo League seasons, and thus had the original Pokmon opening song attached to them. Most unfortunately, Viz felt it necessary to put the Orange Island opening song before the FIRST episode only, and then leaving the original opening transition screens intact with the first song. After those three episodes, the intros matched.

Then we come to the way that the menus on the DVD are actually set up. Selecting ""Play All"" from the DVD menu typically means that all episodes run in continuous sequence. Nay. Not this DVD set. Every time an episode comes to its end and this is the weird thing, ONLY after the third episode on the disk, the viewer is forced to select to play the next episode to start it.

Then we have the lack of intro and ending songs at each episode. My thought on this is that they cut the opening and ending songs at the beginning and end of each episode because they were trying to address the video compression quality issues that many people had complained about in past boxed sets.

The video quality is quite nice in this set (Note: being viewed on a 42 inch Sharp Aquos HDTV.), But I do miss the openings and endings. My only qualm (and it is being anal, I know but STILL) I wish they had matched the proper opening song to the proper episodes by including both opening and ending songs on the DVD.

One other thing I noticed that was different (not in that good way)is the disk art is exactly the same on every disk, except it says Disc 2 and 3 to differentiate.

Disk 2 so far is faring much better than the first disk. The menu image is MUCH better and looks slightly more like a professional DVD than a pathetic attempt at a Fan-made DVD. I mean, I've made DVD menus before and MINE looked more professional than the first disk's menu. That's pretty pathetic when you can say that about an official product. The issue that the first disk had seems to have been eliminated. Users are free to skip between episodes without being forced back to the episode selection menu. The Play All function works PERFECTLY, the opening and ending songs play at the beginning and ending songs play in their proper places in EVERY episode, and the video (while only SLIGHTLY compromised) looks pretty crisp and clean. Whoever did the second disk did a WAY better job than the hacks who did the first one.

This would have been a 5 star product had it not been for the shoddy DVD menu production and episode setup on the first disk, and as always, the complete and total lack of Japanese language tracks (We're still waiting, Viz.)

If you're trying like me to get Pokmon on DVD in its entirety, pick this up. It's got all 36 episodes of the Orange Islands arc, and the video is good. If weird DVD operations and menu organization on one of the disks and aesthetic properties don't bother you, 5 stars, pick it up NOW. You won't regret it. Its a good solid set, and you'll be that much closer to having all your Pokmon episodes on DVD. Enjoy, all! =)

3370724,4,B0014Z4OOS,"This is the version of the Orange Island set that people need to buy, as it includes all 36 episodes, as it says on the top banner at the top.

This release from 2009 has the episodes ""Stage Fight"" and ""The Mandarin Island Miss-Match"" which both have been omitted from the recent 2015 re-release, due to the appearance of Jynx in both episodes, where she still has the old ""black-face"" look, instead of her ""purple-face"" look. It never occurred to Viz to use new versions of these episodes where the Japanese would use digital editing to alter the colour, or this practice could be done by Pokmon USA and they would just insert the existing dub, but alas they don't!

So to get all the episodes, including those two episodes, you'll need to get this 36 episode set from 2009. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars though is that the episodes are from the original Viz's releases and so therefore have 12 episodes on each disc, so the bitrate would be the same as some of those early Lionsgate ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" releases. They'll be watchable, but there maybe times where the low bitrate is noticeable.

Despite that though, this is the set to get and the best many of us will get to see the whole Orange Island saga of Pokmon.",1432944000,5,1244,4.447368421052632

3370820,5,B0014Z4OOS,"To anyone hesitating to buy the Pokemon DVDs here in the US, you might as well buy them because the only legal way to watch the original Japanese versions would require taking a citizenship test in Japan (The show is only available for rental in Japan). Regardless of my little quip, 4kids did their best to stay both faithful to the story and be family-friendly to Americans at the same time.

Now, I barely watched the whole first disc, but I'm going to spoil it a little: After receiving an interesting Pokeball that is unopenable, Brock stays behind with Prof. Ivy and Tracey joins the gang for the season. (Don't worry, Brock fans, Tracey does get removed at the end.) Ash competes against the Gym Leaders of the Orange Archipelago. Interesting stuff happens in between, sticking with the continuity of a regular Pokemon story\scenario.

The quality of the picture and sound is great. The stories are written out well for the quality you expect from both the Japanese (regarding visual) and American (regarding translation and synchronization to the pictures) writers.

To be less confused, Seasons 1-5 (Indigo League, Adventures on the Orange Islands, Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions and Master Quest) are what hardcore Pokemon anime enthusiast call the original series. (Back in Japan, the 5 seasons were part of one continuous which were titled ""Pocket Monsters"") I already have the rerelease of the first (Indigo League) and second (Adventures on the Orange Islands) seasons. I'm begging for The Pokemon Company to re-issue the 3rd, 4th and 5th seasons, or rather, I'm asking why there aren't rereleases of the season in question. I have bought nearly every Pokemon DVD since The first Advanced season. Why wouldn't the company rerelease the episodes is beyond me.

For those of you who love Pokmon, but haven't seen this series, I'd recommend picking it up. It's just as fun as the first series, but it does seem a bit hokey. It's more like a parody of Pokmon than an actual new season, with Team Rocket getting even more over-the-top, and Ash becoming a bit more stereotypically anime. It also has a feeling of watching Scooby-Doo, with crazy inane plots, total non-sequiturs and just generally weird stuff. Pikachu and Togepi get much more screen time, it seems like after every line the camera cuts to a close up on one of them, and as Pokmon, they don't have much to say.

It seems the loss of Brock hit the writers hard, and Tracy is sometimes half-Brock, secretly swooning over Super Jenny from Pinkan island (home to the pink pokemon) and Ultra Strong Joy who travels the Orange Islands on kayak. He's a bit more of a creeper, too. Brock was up-front about his love for attractive women, while Tracy mostly just sits back and draws them. He's no Brock, but likable nonetheless.

3370833,5,B0014Z4OOS,"With Pokemon now over 10 season's old, it is hard to imagine that there was a day where there was only just 150 Pokemon.

And Ash Ketchum was traveling with Misty and Tracy.

With Brock gone to live at Professor Ivy, Ash and Misty found themselves tempory alone until they bumped into Tracy, a Pokemon watcher.

Also Pikachu and Togepi are there with them all the way in this DVD series.

The second season of Pokemon was perhaps the shortest and Ash Ketchum was able to just go though 4 unique Pokemon gym battles where the rules apply to more than just battle, Ash also had to surf, build a Bobslead out of ice, and also this was the first time where double battles were used.

Adventures on the Orange Islands is for any old school Pokemon fan who always remembered the old Ash and Misty romance. Episodes like Misty meets her match and Where art thou Pokemon provide a few hints towards an Ash x Misty relationship.

And also even when Brock was not there trying to make his moves on all the girls, Tracy was a good replacement as intead of trying to pull the romantic moves on all the Nurse Joys and Officer Jennys he was instead drawing all the girls in his sketch book.

Tracy of course loves to draw pokemon in his sketch book and that is also the same when he loves to draw all the girls that he meets allong his journey to become a Pokemon Watcher and his ultimate dream is to some day work for the famous Professor Oak.

So for anyone who loves Pokemon but who does not want to watch a whole series of episodes where Ash works so hard to reach a certain Pokemon league competition only to be unlucky to be defeated, then this one is for you as The Orange Island series was short but worth full of good Pokemon nostaliga and Ash finally wins a Pokemon tornument in the Orange Islands in an amazing match against a powerful opponent.

3370834,3,B0014Z4OOS,"****Update for this previous review.  The only point I was trying to make in the past about the individual orange island dvd's is that the individuals provide more options (like captions).  I like dvd's with captions because you can't always tell, word for word, what a character is saying.  I like the older Pokemon dvd releases, such as the Master Quest box sets.  Those have captions.  Plus the dvd menu presentations are nicer.  If you are not picky about those things, then the Kanto (season 1) and Orange Island (Season 2) box sets will probably work out just fine.  Also getting them in bulk ""is"" cheaper and takes up less space on the shelf.  Being a Pokemon fan I am particular about things that other people can do without.*********  Update posted on June 25th 2013.

Ok I'll admit, I haven't seen this particular product.  But I have seen most Pokemon DVD's and I read one of the reviews, so I will say this:

When you compare the Orange Island DVD box sets and the Indigo box sets with the original releases, here is what you get:

1. Ever since the Master Quest box sets where finished Viz has been steering clear of offering English subtitles.  This is one feature the individual volumes almost always have.  Why do we need English subtitles?  Well I for one think that they are very helpful because sometimes we just don't understand what a person is saying and subtitles really clear that up.  I'm not joking!  We are not as nearly as good at understanding our own language as we pretend.  That's not to say that we are dence.

2.  The menu's are much nicer and cuter in the individual volumes than they are in the box sets.

3.  Sometimes in these new box sets the intros, themes, transitions, and endings get mixed up or left out completely.  One reviewer said it was because, the endings for example, somehow messes with the video quality.
That's stupid!  In all the endings I have seen, and I own just about all of the Pokemon DVD's, I have never noticed anything that takes away from the quality of the program.  And besides, if you don't want to watch the ending you can always push the ""Next Chapter"" button on your DVD remote to start the next episode.

Here is my suggestion for the Orange Islands.  Look up ""Pokemon Orange Islands"" in the Amazon search engine.  You will find the new box set and the individual volumes.  Buy the individuals!  Wether it is from Amazon themselves or from Amazon sellers (for a cheaper price).  It is well worth it!  I have the Individual Orange Island volumes myself and they are super fantastic!",1213920000,4,2554,4.567328918322295
