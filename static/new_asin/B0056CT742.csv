8459417,5,B0056CT742,"Greetings;

For those of you who have been perhaps looking around for a cheaper copy of the hot anime, Cat Planet Cuties-as it is known in the United States, there could perhaps be a way to go. This however, for those of you who have been considering it, is not the Funimation Release. This is actually a foreign import. 12 episodes on 1 disk and only dubbed in Japanese and only subtitled in English. That is to say, it is not english dubbed and it lacks the 13th additional OVA episode.

Now, you should ask yourself if you want to spend what-around $42 for the Funimation dvd/blu-ray release or would you like to spend a wee bit less for a foreign import. Now mind you, I have myself bought a number of foreign import anime programs and have found that they can be a bit buggy. High end and low end dvd players can have different problems playing them in some cases, whole sections of shows can start to crap out on you. Thought whats more, there are a number of websites that can sell this self same set for only $20. Which is not so bad if you are only looking to test it out without spending more than $40.

Anyway, loved the show, though have only watched it in English Dubbed so far. Thank you and take care...",1338508800,,1218,4.28695652173913
