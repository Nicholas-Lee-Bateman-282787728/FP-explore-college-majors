7894208,1,6305759928,"Special Effects
There is one bullet wound special effect in this picture on the back of the head of a falling gangster.  Maybe about 12 frames.  Enjoy that special effect, because the rest of this picture is blood-free. Even though the lead gangsters shoot many people at point blank range, the shooters remain untainted.  All of the gun fire is layered on with post-production compositing.

The granularity of the color grade filter they put on the entire movie is beyond amateurish.  It looks like it was color graded by a pointillist in a Mt. Saint Helens ash cloud.

Script
Surely gangsters have more going on in their minds than this.  Firefight in a warehouse, argument over their resolve to kill the opposition.  Firefight in the warehouse again, argument over their resolve.  Firefight... etc. So tedious and repetitive, so clearly improvised by amateurs, so many arguments, so little variance in emotion, so little depth or complexity.  So little surprise.

Music
Classic rap music is the featured lead character in this piece, and its mind-numbing repetition on the theme of violence becomes almost funny.  I never realized that rap lyrics say only one thing: ""Here's a list of violent things.""

This is a great movie to do your own subtitles to.  ""Hey, man. It's dark in here. I think my eyes are going.""  ""No, man that's the way this movie is shot.""  ""Can I borrow your glasses?"" ""Yeah, but I'm telling you, it's no better with glasses on.""",1346716800,,1452,4.841463414634147

snoop dog is the best actor in this movie, he gets shot before the film begins. and he makes it to the cover of the movie!?
the rest of the movie is so bad and unprofessional that you ask yourself many times, is this possible?
how can a guy like ice-t live with an impression of that this is a movie to release all over the world
get a life.
okey.
but this moive is a classic now, i love to think of it.
it is halerious. i give it 5 stars, just because it is great to think of.
rent it or buy it, either way, watch it!

7894210,1,6305759928,"Urban Menace, The Corrupt & this one: The Wrecking crew are all three similar films...
This is becouse almost the same crew of actors appears in everyone of them & also Al Pyun is the director of all.
First of all SNOOP DOGG is not in the movie, they have taken interview footage of him speaking about his music and then pretended that this is suppose to be the character Dra-man a gangster & rapper.
They took old footage from the movie ""Urban Menace"" and pretended that Ice-t killed him off in the beginning of the movie.
Even though this movie is longer than ""Urban Menace"" , Wrecking Crew's 78 minutes has about 13 minutes of start-credits and 13 minutes of end-credtis, while Urban Menace is 72 minutes with only the half runningtime of the credits. (which means that Urban Menace is longer, and also a whole lot better storywise).
I was interrested in the dvd-version becouse u get the ""soundtrack"" so I expected at least one Ice-T song, but NO only ""spooky music"" seems to be the feature.
The movie itself is really bad, It's like URBAN MENACE but 10 times worse",1074384000,2,1069,4.544041450777202

THE MOST C**P FILM I'VE EVER SEEN!!!",1064448000,2,369,4.138888888888889
7894212,1,6305759928,"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is barely noticable, the actors do even worse. Snoop, who is heavily announced on the cover is only a part of the intro, then he is not to be seen throughout the rest of the movie. To be brief: Do not buy this DVD, it's a waste of money!",973036800,7,295,3.933333333333333
