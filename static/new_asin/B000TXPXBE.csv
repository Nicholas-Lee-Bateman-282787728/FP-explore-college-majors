8211381,5,B000TXPXBE,I gave this product the highest rating because I have been looking all over for this movie for over six months. When I ordered the movie I received it very fast and I've watched with by daughters about 5 times already. Thank You So Much,1363996800,,236,4.266666666666667
8211382,3,B000TXPXBE,"Holla was a mildly entertaining Urban slasher that has some faces people will recognize and some that people will not. It's heavy on the urban slang and very funny in parts. The story line was good enough even though we've seen it before and it's very formulaic. I love the idea of Urban slashers because let's be real,if you were Black wouldn't you get tired of seeing a bunch of white people saying ""Like That's so Awesome Dude"" Etc.
The gore factor was low but the special effects were good enough. There really weren't that many effects  except for gunshot wounds a few stabs here and there and an axe in a back. One of the main reasons I love Slasher flicks is because I love the Gore and seeing how well the effects are done so for that reason I only give it 3 stars.
All in all I had fun watching it but would not watch it again say like my Favorite Urban Slasher ""Somebody Help Me'which I have watched many times.",1363046400,,921,4.293103448275862
8211383,5,B000TXPXBE,"Finally saw this flick.  I can see why some don't like it but, me and the fam laughed a lot and it even had some cool scares.  This is a very cool movie for the genre and budget.  Highly recommended.",1301788800,,199,3.925
8211384,1,B000TXPXBE,this is one of the sorriest attempts at horror i've ever seen! you have good b movies... well this one is a F,1206835200,2,109,3.782608695652174
8211385,3,B000TXPXBE,"This was not just black people replacing white people in the same old ""youths up in the cabin"" slasher flick. This was a good movie. It was character driven and well acted. A surprise ending in this genre is always a surprise. I must say, I was surprised by the ending. As a major slasher fan, I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is no Friday the 13th or Halloween, but it is a very good movie. The black people acted as we black people woule expect them to act in this situation. As a matter of fact, that is one of the things that was so appealing in the movie; so many of the characters  reminded me of people I actually know, which provided for some comical moments. While this movie may not beg for a sequel, it is well worth what I paid for it.",1198800000,11,757,4.114864864864865
