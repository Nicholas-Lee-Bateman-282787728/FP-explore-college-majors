2155993,5,B0003OXEE2,"This DVD is great for beginners and experienced users.  I like having the modifications so I can work my way into some of the more advanced poses.  I am challenging myself with each session.  And I feel better overall.  Monica's approach to Fertility Yoga has helped me get my thyroid stabilized, which is so important to fertility and pregnancy. Monica, thanks for sharing your experience and giving us hope.",1101081600,5,409,4.884057971014493
2155994,5,B0003OXEE2,I had never done yoga before and the modifications suggested throughout this tape really helped me feel comfortable doing yoga.  I found it to be very relaxing and afterwards I felt so much better.  My husband even commented on how relaxed I looked!  I will recommend this DVD to everyone!,1100563200,3,289,4.74
2155995,5,B0003OXEE2,"I am an avid yoga fan, and have spent many hours working out from home.  This dvd is by far the best I have found.  The workout is perfect for me and the stretches are just what I was looking for. Many of the yoga videos on the market do not compare to this one, and I would recommend this video to anyone who wants a complete workout, regardless of fertility issues.  Thanks Monica for a WONDERFUL video!",1100563200,7,405,4.166666666666667
2155996,2,B0003OXEE2,"Some women might really enjoy this DVD; however, I was not one of them.  I've been practicing yoga for about three months by taking some classes and using the AM/PM tapes successfully every day.  This tape required balance and flexibility that I just don't have.  In addition, Monica Morell is big on stretches for the ""thyroid"" which means a lot of back and neck bending.  These did very little for me and actually made me feel sick.  As I said, some folks might really love this tape; it just wasn't for me.",1100563200,6,509,4.489130434782608
2155997,5,B0003OXEE2,"I have tried other fertility yoga videos but this is the one!  It was fantastic.  Monica is heart and soul for fertility and for yoga.  The video is effective, imformative, and great for all levels.  I felt so wonderful after just my first try with this video. Like I could handle anything.  There is no glam to this video, just a grassroots work from the heart.  I bet it works too.  I am counting on it.  I HIGHLY recommend this one.",1254960000,,435,4.283950617283951
2155998,2,B0003OXEE2,"The video wasn't a complete waste of time, but if you're a person that does yoga at studios or more professional videos then you will not like this DVD.
The instructor doesn't even do the poses, and when she does she looks like she can't even get in them all the way. I would think that if you've practiced for so many years that you would be at least somewhat more flexable.... At least so we can see what the pose is supposed to look like.
It does not flow well through quite a few poses. You'll be in one position and then she'll have you move to another that doesn't flow with the first.
She skips a side of your body half way through warrior poses - I'm shocked that no one has mentioned this in other reviews.
She chants at the end....what is that?",1249516800,2,754,4.171232876712328
2155999,3,B0003OXEE2,"First of all, I will admit that I got pregnant the same cycle I started using this DVD, but I don't credit it solely for my success.  It's pretty pricey, so if you can get is used, try that.  It's not very ""professional"" quality - looks more homemade, but the yoga moves are basic and feel safe for TTC.  I think this can be helpful in RELAXING you physically and mentally for TTC, but I don't see anything necessarily special about this compared to other yoga dvds. The one part I had a really hard time with was the CHANTING that they advise you to do during the workout.  It felt a little cultish, so being a Christian, I was praying out loud to open my womb instead of chanting ""Ommmmmm"".",1230681600,2,692,4.259541984732825
2156000,4,B0003OXEE2,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews, her accent is a little annoying, but it can be overlooked.  The poses could be held for a little longer to deepen the stretch more, but overall I really like it.  I have not done yoga before, but I am pretty athletic and have really gotten into it.  Once you get the poses figured out, she does a great job walking you through them.  I don't even need to watch the screen much anymore and I have only done it 4+ times.",1210809600,,472,4.043010752688172
2156001,5,B0003OXEE2,This is a great DVD for both those who have experience with yoga and those who haven't done it before. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow and the instructor is especially pleasant and unpretentious. The series of moves is well organized and she gives you different variations you can do with several poses. Doing this series always leaves me feeling relaxed and has helped me deal with the stress of infertility. I recommend it most highly!,1208390400,4,456,4.784810126582278
2156002,5,B0003OXEE2,"If I could rate this more than five stars, I would.  I highly recommend this fertility yoga video - it worked for me!  This yoga is great for anyone who is trying to get pregnant.  I have practiced yoga for a while now and like how Monica chose traditional yoga poses from all the thousands of yoga poses that seem to help most with our reproductive and hormonal balance, as she says.  Anyone can do this video and feel comfortable doing it.  Her style is very natural - and, dare I say, healing!  I also like how Monica explains the benefits of the poses for fertility.  It is the real deal.",1208217600,5,592,4.2792792792792795
2156003,4,B0003OXEE2,Monica's DVD is a good way to relax and to focus on your breathing. The DVD is soothing even though you are exercising and focusing on releasing toxins. Adding this DVD to your routine also adds to the piece of mind that you are doing one more thing to be pro active in addressing issues of fertility.,1206576000,,301,4.298245614035087
2156004,5,B0003OXEE2,"I stumbled across this video when I was searching for help with my secondary infertility struggles. This video has helped me with enduring fertility treatments and has opened my mind, body and spirit. I love
to do it at home when my son is napping and I feel so relaxed. I already
got pregnant right after doing this video, unfortunately it ended in miscarriage, however, I am hopeful that I will prevail again. I never was a yoga person before I started doing this now I love it. I also have a chronicle hip problem and these poses are wonderful to open up and stretch out my hip. A perfect companion to anyone who is experiencing infertility.",1206576000,3,644,4.512820512820513
2156005,1,B0003OXEE2,"Like another reviewer said this is really a trap for desperate women. She was clever to name it ""Fertility Yoga"" because otherwise she would not have sold a single copy!! Her voice is annoying and her cueing is awful. There is nothing calming about this and come on she uses ""Crack open your chest"" for chest opening instruction, and ""Snoring with your mouth closed"" is not the best explaination of Ujayi breath!! There was nothing in this DVD that would make it specifically beneficial for fertility as opposed to other Yoga DVDs. You would be much better off with Barbara Benagh's ""Yoga for Stress Relief"". At least she is a quality instructor and the DVD is well made.  Don't waste your money on this one! All those positive reviews must have been from friends of hers. Oh Yeah, at one point I think she actually burped while she was talking.",1204675200,9,845,4.633333333333334
2156006,1,B0003OXEE2,"I've been doing yoga for about 10 years and found this dvd because I thought it would be nice to do a practice specifically oriented toward fertility.  I was disappointed in the teaching and the asanas (postures) the teacher uses.  I've been blessed to study yoga from some wonderful teachers, and based on that I saw on this video, this teacher isn't one of them.  I used the video once, and then just decided to resume my regular yoga practice.

She did poses on one side then didn't do the same on the other side of the body before moving on to a different pose, and to me that feels awkward. Why would I want to open up one hip and not the other?

I also wished for more information about why these poses are supposed to be good for fertility.  Basically I didn't see any difference between this series and any other basic yoga flow series, except that this series really didn't seem to flow very well.

Also for me, I didn't find the teacher's voice inspiring or soothing...she seemed sort of grating, redundant, and her instruction seemed very flat.  Specifically, her instruction of the Ujjayi breath -which is the basic breath used throughout the practice seemed very lacking... I don't think if I hadn't already used this breath I would have ""gotten it"" from her description.

Basically I didn't learn anything, and from what I've studied in yoga, this isn't a very good video.",1203984000,8,1386,4.6016260162601625
2156007,4,B0003OXEE2,"Love it!  I've never experienced yoga before this.  I've always been afraid it would be very uncomfortable and awkward.  This one doesn't.  I've been using it at the end of everyday to help relieve stiff muscles and stress.  Mostly stress.  I bought to help with fertility, but found it did so many other things for me.  I'm thoroughly thrilled with it as a beginner yoga student.",1196899200,3,380,4.666666666666667
2156008,5,B0003OXEE2,"I am new to yoga, so I find the workout to be challenging. I did find the instructions for doing the poses relatively easy to follow. I have not attempted to become pregnant again, so I cannot comment on that. I'm using these excersies more as a pre-conception overall health approach more so than for infertility.",1196208000,,314,4.625
2156009,5,B0003OXEE2,"I Love this DVD. I never practiced yoga before and bought the DVD because I heard about how yoga can help me with my fertility. This DVD makes me feel great after doing it I feel so at peace, positive, and relaxed. I strongly recommend this DVD for anyone trying to get pregnant.",1191974400,2,279,4.283018867924528
2156010,5,B0003OXEE2,"I am so happy to have this DVD.  I never practiced yoga before and bought the DVD because I heard about how yoga can help me with my fertility.  It is really good because anyone can do it first of all.  And secondly, I think it really works because I just found out I am pregnant.
I do know that  I learned to be so relaxed and calm through doing Fertility Yoga.  It helped to strengthen and tone not only my body but it seems like my mind too.  I always felt comfortable doing Fertility Yoga and I think that is because Monica gently guides a person through the yoga poses--often times showing modifications that best suit anyone's level.  At any rate, I highly, highly recommend this DVD.",1191196800,3,690,4.34375
2156011,5,B0003OXEE2,Wow!  I am so happy I found this DVD.  My friend recommended it to me after she got pregnant.  I was skeptical at first  but Monica makes the whole  fertility yoga sequence seem so easy and natural.  I had not practiced yoga before but there are different modified poses you can do so I always feel comfortable.  And my husband does the DVD with me too.  He loves it -- we love it.  I highly recommend this fertility yoga DVD for women and couples who are trying to conceive.,1190592000,3,475,4.247191011235955
2156012,1,B0003OXEE2,The video seems home-made. It's is hard to trust its content if the quality is so amateur. I would like to have my money back.,1190332800,2,126,4.08
2156013,5,B0003OXEE2,"My first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, and I found myself very stressed out about trying to conceive again.  I loved Fertility Yoga video with Monica the first time I tried it, as it helped me find balance and relaxation.  Yoga typically bores me, but this video has a lot of different poses and moves quickly enough to keep me engaged.  I would highly recommend it for any woman.",1182124800,10,384,4.536231884057971
2156014,5,B0003OXEE2,"I did this dvd for the first time today and found it really wonderful.  Monica is sweet and right on but not too ""out"" there for everyone to get the concept.  I liked the flow, the stretches were great and I feel like I did something really good for my body.  Its nice to have our fertility issues addressed and encouraging to be able to participate in healing our bodies!!

Love it!",1179273600,3,383,4.277777777777778
2156015,5,B0003OXEE2,"This is the first time that I have ever been able to follow a yoga DVD start to finish. Usually the instructor moves too quickly or does poses that I am not able to do or modify on my own. This is a wonderful instructional presentation that left me feeling relaxed and strong. I have been able to use this DVD repeatedly (also a first) because while it is easy to follow, I have been continuing to improve my flexibility, strength and breathing.",1179187200,3,445,4.373493975903615
2156016,5,B0003OXEE2,"I really have enjoyed Monica's DVD.  I find it relaxing, inspiring, I feel great after the session.  There are a lot of hip openers, great for fertility.  And her words are so encouraging and gentle, just what is needed while going through the difficult time that infertility can be.  I would highly recommend this tape for anyone trying to become pregnant at any stage or if you just want to relax and feel great!!",1179014400,4,415,4.5675675675675675
2156017,5,B0003OXEE2,"I have tried three other video yoga routines, and while i have enjoyed all of them, they tend to make me smirk.  The instructors, to me, take themselves a bit too seriously for an at-home yoga routine.  But Monica Morell comes across as a friend, someone I could actually know and like.  She seems very accessible.  She has a realistic body, and the four women practicing the routine behind her also have realistic bodies (no carved-out triceps here).  Monica is not the most flexible woman, nor am I, so it is comforting to know it's okay if I cannot sit cross-legged, lean forward, and plant my face on the floor.  She assures the viewer that it is okay to modify the poses for comfort.  I have only just started practicing with this DVD, so I don't yet know whether it will have an effect on my fertility, but at the very least it is a very calm, friendly video that allows me about 40 minutes of peaceful movement.",1178928000,3,918,4.428571428571429
2156018,5,B0003OXEE2,"I highly recommend this yoga DVD to everyone.  Dr. Morell brings a great deal of experience and insight into this yoga program.  She has a great introduction where she explains how this yoga program will help and she even has real testimonials at the end of the tape with women who have practiced her fertility yoga program and were either pregnant or had a baby.  It really is inspirational.  The practice itself has a great flow with many poses, most have variations so that anyone (experienced and novice) can practice.  Her narration brings me through step-by-step yet I feel empowered like it is my own practice.  This is a grass roots type of DVD.  It seems to be made more from the heart than anything. How else could she have so much insight into what I needed?  I liked it a great deal because it made me feel comfortable, and I truly saw some results in just a short time.  Oh and did I mention the background music?  It is right on point.",1178841600,3,949,4.433526011560693
2156019,1,B0003OXEE2,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I have been practising Yoga for 8 years and so I have some idea of a good yoga session.  The instructors voice is extremely annoying, there isn't a flow to the class and it is way too fast.  She has you moving from sitting to standing to laying, absolutely no flow.  She doesn't even join in on most of the movements and the other participants on the tape are obviously struggling to keep up.  The dvd appears to have been filmed by an novice, so the quality is poor.

I believe she has used the Fertility title to entice people into buying, don't be fooled as I was.  If you are looking for a yoga tape for fertility, I would personally recommend Yoga 4 Fertility, which has been professionally recorded, the instructors voice is soothing and clear, the session flows together at a slow comfortable pace.  You actually feel that you have benefited from it.",1178150400,9,895,4.515527950310559
2156020,4,B0003OXEE2,"I don't know if this really works for fertility, but it has definitely helped me calm my nerves.  I focus more on relaxed breathing throughout the day, and my body feels much better.

It is easy to follow, tons of options for people (like me) who aren't as flexible.  I definitely recommend it.  I rarely do the whole thing, but it is easy to jump from one section to another.  The host's breathing is a little dramatic, but not too bad.",1173830400,3,437,4.345679012345679
2156021,5,B0003OXEE2,"My husband and myself have been trying for over three years to get pregnant, and I've tried alot of yoga dvd's to help deal with the overall stress.  Fertility Yoga is great for this purpose.  I only just recently started using it, but I'm really enjoying the format and the way I feel after I've done it.  Monica guides you through all the poses with clear instruction and talks about how certain poses help fertility.  I don't know if it will get us pregnant, but it's certainly helping with the journey.",1173312000,3,506,4.527472527472527
2156022,4,B0003OXEE2,"I've had this DVD for a month now and I find it's a great way to relax and unwind at the end of the day. I haven't tried it in the mornings yet but I will soon, I think it sets a positive mindset and helps me feel grounded. Monica has a slight upstate NY accent...sounds like Watertown, NY. But she's genuine and encouraging, doesn't talk too much. She gives just enough information for you to understand why these poses help with fertility, but really anyone can do it. My fiance wants to do it with me to stretch, breathe, and relax.

I will have to mention that there's one participant on the video who's kind of distracting, she looks into the camera awkwardly rather than just doing the poses as though the camera isn't there. But when you're focusing on doing the poses you hardly notice her.

The DVD also contains some testimonials from women who now have babies!! So that's inspiring, and each of them did Fertility yoga to support their efforts to conceive. It's a wise purchase if you're looking for some hope and a sense that you're doing one more thing in support of your fertility.

Update as of November 2010: I became pregnant shortly after using this DVD. Prior to using it I had been trying for a good 10 months. Our daughter is turning 3 next week! Working on baby #2 now. Good luck to all!!",1171065600,5,1314,4.399176954732511
2156023,5,B0003OXEE2,"I have never written a review before but I had to post one here because I was really blown away by this fertility yoga video.  I ordered it a couple of months ago and fell in love with it instantly.  Monica has a dynamite fertility yoga session for women who are trying to get pregnant.  She sets a really nice pace using women in her video that are all very different so that you can relate well to at least one of them.  She gently leads through a sequence of traditional yoga poses that seem to be carefully sequenced to enhance fertility.  I could actually feel a difference after the first time.  I practiced this yoga regularly.  I began to experience some unbelievable physical and emotional results.  I became stronger and had some of the best cycles ever.  I know that there aren't any silver bullets but I really believe that it was this fertility yoga tape that helped me become pregnant. All I know is that I was having all sorts of trouble getting pregnant before this yoga, then once I started doing this yoga I felt a real change in me - both physical and mental and now I am pregnant.  So I believe that it really, really helped me.  I think that here we have a qualified yoga instructor who is also a psychologist who also understands the condition of fertility.  The net result is a very effective yoga therapy.  I did try other yoga videos but they did not seem to work mostly because I felt like a guest in someone's house.  With Monica's yoga, I felt completely comfortable and at home.",1169164800,8,1507,4.413043478260869
2156024,5,B0003OXEE2,"This is a great DVD for anyone trying to get pregnant.  It has really helped me to relax and deal with the stress associated with fertility treatments and life in general.  It's also great to be able to get exercise in a way that does not interfere with my efforts to get pregnant.  Since most doctors and books warn you not to do any strenuous exercise, I was starting to feel out-of-shape and lethargic.  Monica Morell's fertility yoga routine is geared specifically toward women trying to conceive, so it's not only safe, it also enhances fertility.

The DVD is easy to follow, with clear instructions and modifications for beginners like me.  I am not very flexible, but after doing this routine, I always feel a lot more limber.  It has even helped get rid of some of my aches and pains!

Good luck - I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me.",1168300800,7,854,4.42948717948718
2156025,5,B0003OXEE2,This yoga routine is very special.  I am amazed as how good I feel after I practice this yoga.  I have been using the tape for a few weeks now and I have already notice a physical difference as well as I feel more calm and centered.  I have been practicing yoga on/off for several years so I feel I know the difference.  What I really like is that the tape works for beginners as well as more experienced folks--modifications are offered throughout.  Monica is a gem.  She knows her stuff and has a very intuitive way of guiding us through the class.  I know that this fertility yoga video is going to help me.  I am grateful that I found it.,1167868800,3,642,4.204918032786885
2156026,4,B0003OXEE2,"I always feel really good after this CD.  The previous poster is confused, the narrator has a Rhode Island accent, and it is a bit nasal, but it doesn't bother me.  Production values are low--it's kind of a low-budget seeming production but I think the routine is really nice. Who knows if it will help but it can't hurt, and I have read of a study in Sweden that showed that yoga did help fertility.",1158883200,,400,4.32
2156027,3,B0003OXEE2,"This lady is effective but her voice sounds very nasal, uber New Yawk. She also does weird things like encouraging your breathing to be like ""snoring through your noise,"" then she makes this irritating noise several times. Also her microphone picks up every noise she makes, and she makes a lot of annoying ones. Other than the annoying, and not very relaxing method of the instructor, the yoga is great and makes you feel wonderful. Its pretty easy to follow and includes modifications. How this lady became a yoga instructor with a less-than-calming voice is beyond me, but once you get past your ""Downward Dawgs"" and general voice, its pretty good.",1133395200,6,651,4.873873873873874
2156028,4,B0003OXEE2,"some of the reviews below sound so enthusiastic it makes me wonder if they are friends of the DVD's author.  some of the reviews below seem overly harsh.  I land somewhere in between, but closer to the positive side.

I like the flow of the poses.  I've done challenging yoga in the past, but since then I've had injuries, so I needed a medium-level practice.  this dvd fit my needs well, and I imagine if you are a beginner, as long as you aren't adverse to trying new things, you could make it work for you (she offers easier versions of some of the more difficult poses).

the biggest criticism i have was mentioned below:  two poses are left out; they are done on one side but she skips them on the other.  (The poses are bent-leg triangle and reverse triangle.)  it's unfortunate that they didn't catch that problem.  however, the fix is simple -- pause the DVD and do them on your own; you've already heard the instructions for the first side so it's pretty easy to do.

some people mentioned problems with her tone of voice but i had no problems with it.  most of the yoga instructors i know have a vocal quality like that.  she seemed very direct, straightforward, and gave me the info I needed to get the pose done.

what i really liked is that the series does seem well-tailored to fertility.  as far as I can tell, it was not only relaxing in general, but really helped with blood flow and relaxation-energy to that area of the body.  I rather liked the chanting -- it seemed to send vibrations right where you wanted them -- although i'm too embarrassed to do it if my husband is at home!

i haven't used the other fertility yoga dvd's so I can't compare.  but i chose this one based on comparing amazon's customer reviews, and as far as I can tell so far, I made a good choice.  I've only been using it 3 weeks, so it's too soon to tell if it has made a difference, fertility-wise.  But it has really helped my relaxation and my attitude towards ttc, and I know that can only be good.",1130889600,32,1997,4.317204301075269
2156029,5,B0003OXEE2,"is the 50 minutes I spend doing Fertility Yoga!!  I LOVE FERTILITY YOGA!!!  I am no ""yoga pro"" (I have had very limited exposure to yoga poses), but I enjoy this DVD so much!!

The modifications allow you to slowly ease into the more difficult positions...and trust me--regardless of your flexibility, after a little practice you will be able to do the harder poses!

Monica's voice paired with the peaceful music is very soothing, and I have found that this DVD has also helped me to relax before going to bed.

Let's face it, whether you are facing the stresses of Assisted Reproduction (like me) or just trying to conceive naturally--it's tough to stay positive...and sometimes you just need a little ""Me Time'.  Fertility Yoga has helped me to unwind and loosen up during this trying time!!!",1130803200,5,795,4.766423357664234
2156030,5,B0003OXEE2,"I would highly recommend Monica Morell's Fertility Yoga DVD.  Her breathing exercises were invaluable in getting me through the stressful rollercoaster ride of infertility.  Every time I practiced I felt a deeper connection with my mind and body.  The poses are good, her tone is soothing, and she offers various pose modifications so I always felt comfortable doing this yoga from beginning to end and everywhere in between.  I hope that folks catch on to Monica Morell's Fertility Yoga because she certainly gives us yoga from the heart.

I am so glad to have come across this video, I look forward to ""breathing"" with monica every night. She makes you feel like she knows what you are going through and wants to do all that she can for you. 2 of my friends borrowed it and now are buying it. They are just as hooked as i am.

I had owned other yoga videos that focused on fertility and I could never really relax with them.  Then, I found Monica Morell's video and was thrilled.  Fertility Yoga is simply the BEST video I have seen to supplement fertility treatments. I have recommended it to a couple of my friends who are trying to get pregnant and they LOVE it too.  I like the poses and the style and Monica is very  likable and down to earth.  Her instruction and gentle coaching is really helpful too.  Sometimes when I am doing the tape, I feel like I am in an oasis.  I can't BELIEVE how relaxed and wonderful I feel every single time I go through the routine.  It is exactly what the doctor has ordered for me ... in all aspects of my life, really.  I find this entire video an absolute pleasure and I really look so forward to my yoga session each night now. Relaxation doesn't have to be boring!  (P.S. Even my husband likes doing this video with me ... he finds it to be a wonderful compliment to his stressful job and it has even alleviated his back problems!)",1125705600,3,1258,4.430434782608696
2156033,5,B0003OXEE2,"Now that I am preparing myself for pregnancy, a friend of mine recommended I try  ""Fertility Yoga with Monica Morell"".  I have been following Ms. Morell's DVD in the privacy of my home 3 times a week for over two months.  I can honestly say, I have experienced the ""completeness"" I was looking for.  Monica Morell's routine of breathing techniques combined with her understanding of the higher spirit, power of the mind and the importance of caring for the body has helped me emotionally and physically in my preparation for motherhood.

The techniques and stretches in this DVD are very easy to do and Ms. Morell walks you through each step as if she was right there with you.  She is able to make you feel comfortable and relaxed through the entire routine.  I highly recommend this DVD for any woman that is in the family planning stages of her life.",1125705600,,853,4.6092715231788075
2156034,4,B0003OXEE2,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD. I have tried yoga in the past and decided it wasn't for me. However, when my husband and I started trying to conceive after a loss, I decided to give Fertility Yoga a try. And I LOVE IT! The DVD is put together wonderfully - as a beginner, I found it easy to keep up with and very relaxing. It gave me the means to spend time focusing on myself and relaxing my whole body. Monica's calming voice is soothing and she explains the poses perfectly. I highly recommend it! I am now 10 weeks pregnant after using the DVD for one month. Best wishes!",1121644800,6,573,4.171171171171171
2156035,4,B0003OXEE2,"I own several other yoga videos and have been practicing yoga off and on for 3 years, and thought I'd turn to yoga to help with my chances of conception.  I found this sequence to flow very well, but Monica is a little more ""perky"" than what I'm typically used to. (My favorite yoga DVD is Hemalaya Behl's ""Yoga for Urban Living"".)  However, once you are several minutes into it, you get used to Monica's tone and can enjoy the practice.",1116892800,3,437,4.382716049382716
2156036,5,B0003OXEE2,"I absolutely love this video. It's a great combination of stretching, toning and working on my balance which really helps me focus and be calm. It also feels great. The instruction is clear and I like how she offers modifications if you are not ready for a particular pose. She does a great job of focusing you on your deep breathing which really helps to elicit the relaxation response.

My husband begs me to do my yoga as often as possible as he loves to see my happy and relaxed. (I'm sure I'm a nicer wife after my practice!)",1110499200,6,530,4.353535353535354
8035979,2,B0003OXEE2,"I ordered this dvd hoping that there were some different poses that are not found in most yoga programs. Quality of the product was great but all the poses are the same in your basic yoga program. Don't waste the money on this dvd when all the poses are the same as in any yoga program, particularly the p90x yoga dvd.",1380758400,,318,4.229508196721311
8035980,4,B0003OXEE2,"I've done yoga for years prior to this video, and I know it has some flaws (as mentioned in some of the other reviews regarding the bent-knee triangle), but for some reason, I really love this video.  I find it to be so relaxing and I've been doing it about 5 times a week for three weeks now, and I have noticed a big difference in my flexibility already.  I couldn't even come close to getting my toes to touch the floor in ""plow"" when I first got the DVD, and now I'm able to easily flow into that posture. I actually like Monica's voice and her accent, and feel like this video is helping me get the relaxation and blood flow I need to help us conceive our first baby.  Worth buying for sure!",1371600000,,696,4.140740740740741
8035981,4,B0003OXEE2,I am having a good time with this DVD. It is slowly helping me get back into shape. It has helped me to feel more positive about my journey to motherhood. I am still hoping it does help me to conceive.,1344556800,,201,3.926829268292683
8035982,4,B0003OXEE2,"I enjoy this 50 minute yoga practice, and feel that doing it provides me with a sense of peace and calm during an extremely stressful time. I would definitely recommend it to other women going through fertility treatments.",1299196800,,222,4.868421052631579
8035983,2,B0003OXEE2,"I expected a longer video with much more variety of poses,
but the video was not satisfactory. It is just an ordinary yoga session",1294963200,,130,4.458333333333333
8035984,5,B0003OXEE2,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of becoming healthier and more balanced to help avoid a 4th consecutive miscarriage. I have been doing this DVD nightly as part of a relaxation routine before bed. I find this DVD VERY soothing. Its very calming for the mind and body. It really seems to release all the stress and tension that has built up throughout the day. The poses are not at all difficult, which is great as I am a total beginner. I found the modifications very helpful, as are the explainations as to why the poses are beneficial for fertility. I am very hopeful that it will help me overcome the pregnancy challenges I am facing. I HIGHLY recommend this yoga DVD!",1280534400,,668,4.483606557377049
8035985,4,B0003OXEE2,"I have been practicing yoga regularly for three years, and I found that this DVD matched my yoga ability pretty closely. I admit that I already know how to do all of the poses in the DVD, and I'm not sure that I would recommend it for beginners. It is fairly challenging, but Monica Morell follows a sequence of hip opening poses that felt effective. I can't say whether it will help me get pregnant, but I did feel uplifted by the yogis at the end holding their babies and talking about using the DVD; it was a nice touch.",1274313600,,523,4.24
8035986,5,B0003OXEE2,"This yoga video is great, It helps in making me feel relaxed, and I like the breathing exercises.  She gives  clear and concise instructions and, she gives you variations when you think a pose is difficult for you.  Not a bad video.",1257724800,,232,4.476190476190476
8035987,5,B0003OXEE2,"The exercises are not so easy but she make it easy, her explications are excellents, and she propose also differents positions if you have difficult to do someone.  Really you feel different since begin, but you find everything is necesary to love you, feel you and wait the spirit baby is around you to come to our family.  I'm very happy and satisfaction feeling, is the most i was expected.  Thanks Monica.",1256515200,,409,4.652777777777778
8035988,5,B0003OXEE2,"I was worrying before I bought this video if I can follow the steps since I have never done yoga before. However, it is very easy to following and about the right length of content (about 30-35 mins). The tone of the instructor is just right, not too annoying. The first time it was a little bit tough to follow the steps without looking at the TV (some pose it is impossible to watch the TV), however, from day 2, you can pretty much memorize the steps and relaxed. Found it very relaxing. Will recommend to friends.",1255564800,2,517,4.34020618556701
