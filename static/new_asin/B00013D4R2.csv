8006094,4,B00013D4R2,Friedman is one of those who should have been given an award for standing up against those who would take our freedom of speech away.  Hollywood and the theatre should bow to this icon for allowing art to speak for itself.,1397606400,,222,4.414634146341464
8006095,5,B00013D4R2,"I enjoy documentaries and this one is a good one on a little side-street Hollywood production house. The founders are here interviewed along with scenes from the weird & wonderful films they produced. Things like this should be done and films preserved where possible as it is part of the whole which is Hollywood as we know it.

Something I would watch more than once.",1359676800,,369,4.676923076923077
8006096,3,B00013D4R2,"This movie is problematic in many ways. Basically, the problem is this: if you want to watch this movie, you probably already know about Friedman and Sonney. However, if you already have watched a few SW commentary tracks, or read the book ""Grindhouse"" or other such works, nothing in this movie will really be new to you at all. It isn't bad, per se, as an overview of the exploitation genre, but it also doesn't break any new ground. What's more, it defies expectations by not really having Friedman or Sonney speak to their movies other than in a general sense. Friedman never mentions HGL, which is annoying to me since they talked about blood feast. I liked this movie more while I was watching it than I did a few days later...",1167091200,,733,4.518796992481203
8006097,3,B00013D4R2,"Pop-Culture is screaming for a quality documentary on the roadshow/exploitation flick/B-Movie phenomenon. This documentary starts off with interesting information, but focuses primarily on roadshow icons Dan Sonney and David Friedman. While they are probably the two prime surviving players from the roadshow days, this film shifts the focus from roadshow films to the personal lives of Sonney and Friedman. It is interesting to hear their firsthand accounts of life on the road, but a film like this needs a little something more.

The occasional ""slice of life"" segments showing Sonney and Friedman as everyday folks at home are charming at first, but become well overdone halfway through the video.

If you have never read up on the ""educational roadshow phenomenon"" before, you might find this DVD informative. Sonney and Friedman do a good job describing how they were able to insert nudity into their films in an age where the silver screen was ultra-puritanical.

In the long run, however, seeing a documentary on a subject primarily through the eyes of those who lived it has its drawbacks. Hearing firsthand accounts can be translated into ""firsthand claims"" from two colorful characters who have a penchant for exaggerating the facts. The roadshows, the nudie films, and the B-Movies need a great documentary by an objective person who has a passion for the subject, but not by a subjective player in the business.",1100390400,4,1424,5.182608695652174
