8109179,5,B000EGDN6I,"I found Kari's Push DVD at a used bookstore, and recognized her name from the workouts I did in the late 90s and early 2000s.

As background, I've been out of shape for quite a few years, and in the last few months have finally reduced my stress levels and increased my sleep enough to be able to add exercise.  For several months, I did Just Dance routines, but finally found them not to be intense or long enough to really build me up.  They ARE great for getting up off the couch and starting a routine, but I needed more.  I started doing My Fitness Coach Wii workouts, and found them to be a great way to build up strength and aerobic conditioning, but the timing of the moves drove me a bit crazy.  (Downbeat means start, not middle of the measure, lady!)

Anyway, back to Kari.  I needed something more -- something that would be fun, challenging, and would really get me moving.  When I found this DVD, I was thrilled and bought it like a kid in a candy store.  She is still the same Kari, with the same absolutely wonderful cuing, the same intensity, and the same ""yes, this choreography IS hard"" way of structuring her routines.  I could not do this workout the first time through -- I made it through 15 minutes before I had to stop.  It has taken me a full month to figure out how to do some of the moves.  Here's a summary of what you'll find in the workout:

The video is two workouts together, followed by a stretching sequence.  The first is a 30 minute step workout.  It is comprised of three separate segments that Kari builds from individual components (normally of 8 counts each).  Moves include kicks on the step, repeaters with a scissors on the step, many turns, T-steps, and similar intermediate-to-advanced level moves.  There are very few simple step moves in the segments themselves, but they are used as fill when she is explaining or building the segment.  You'll do each segment completely before moving on to the next, and then do all of it all the way through twice at the end of the workout.  There are MANY turns of various kinds.  If you (like me) get a little dizzy and lost on the turns, be aware that she always shows the non-turn version first, so you can add them as options.  She is also good about providing options if you have knee or other joint limitations.

The second workout is a 30 minute floor workout.  As with most floor workouts, this is at a faster tempo than the step workout and it speeds up even further about halfway through.  There two segments here, with some quite complex footwork required.  In all cases, Kari builds the footwork from a basic ""alternating right and left, put your feet in these places"" level to a level that includes arms, jumps, turns, and complex direction changes.  The cuing is between good and great.  Here too, you will go through the first segment completely, then learn the second segment, and then do them combined.  There are some tricky transitions.  For example, in one place, the segment comes together in a way that means you don't put your foot down between finishing one thing and starting a kick.  Definitely not a beginning move, but fun if you're looking to learn.

I have thoroughly enjoyed every second of this video, and only this week have I been able to do the whole thing.  I can tell that my conditioning is improving, and I'm just delighted to find that Kari is still making videos and that I can still learn to do them!

This is a purchase I would make again in a heartbeat, and in fact I'm on Amazon right now so that I can order a few more of Kari's more recent videos!

Note on my level:  Before my years of couch-potatohood, I did choreographed workouts starting in the '80s (yes, I'm old).  I have various kinds of movement-based training.  (A little martial arts, a little dance, a lot of aerobics, a lot of synchronized swimming when I was young and my knees worked).  For about seven years in the 90s, I did step and floor aerobics 4-5 times per week.  If you are new to dance-based step and floor aerobic workouts, or are not comfortable with turns, this workout may be very challenging.",1440720000,,4104,4.457718120805369
8109180,3,B000EGDN6I,"Unfortunately, I could not get this DVD to work on my player very well.  I returned it for another, but that one didn't work either.  I love Kari Anderson, but couldn't get to try this work out.",1405209600,,194,4.216216216216216
8109181,5,B000EGDN6I,"I own several of Kari Anderson's videos and love them all.  Push consists of a step workout and a hi/lo workout which can be done as one big workout (over an hour) or separated into two challenging 40-minute workouts.  The instructor teaches the moves by ""layering"", and if a layer is too difficult (or if it involves a turn that will be difficult on carpeting), I continue the workout at the layer I'm comfortable with.  Allow yourself time to learn the choreography by sticking with the easier layers when you first start using the video, and you'll be doing the advanced moves in no time!",1279929600,3,591,4.609523809523809
8109182,1,B000EGDN6I,"I literally popped it in the day I received it and was really disappointed. The moves are very dancy and are hard to keep up with. I tried this one several times, but I just hate it! I'm always skeptical when I buy Dvds by trainers that I've never had before, but since she seemed to have so many I figured a lot of people liked her so might as well try. WRONG!!! This now sits in the dark corner at the back of my t.v. cabinet with all the other rejects!",1262736000,,455,3.9565217391304346
8109183,5,B000EGDN6I,"I absolutely love this workout.  I have been doing the step portion for one year and now decided to try the floor portion.  At first I thought it was too difficult, but now that I mastered the choreography, I love it.  I suggest both workouts.  Warning....intermediate to advanced level....",1231891200,3,290,4.857142857142857
8109184,2,B000EGDN6I,".... I just didn't like this one. I am an upper intermediate to advanced home exerciser, and I tried the step portion several times, but just couldn't get into it.  I got bored and thought that Kari, although very fluid, was just not my kind of instructor.  To me, she just seemed a bit TOO professional - I want to have fun in a cardio workout, and this was just bland for me.  I gave it two stars just for the fact that it has cardio benefits, but for me it just wasn't much fun.  I would rather workout to Michelle Dozios or Keli Roberts - they both pack ultra intense moves that are fun and motivating.  This one just wasn't worth the time.",1190851200,4,644,4.161290322580645
8109185,5,B000EGDN6I,"If you're knew to step aerobics you'll want to start with Kari's excellent ""Go: Step for Beginners"" (which is actually quite challenging) and then move on to this wonderful workout, as the movements here are much more complex. It includes a 30 segment of step aerobics, another 30 minute segment of both atheletic and dance-oriented floor aerobics, and a 5 minute cool-down.

The music is mostly a fast-paced club/techno style, and I recoginzed a few of the tracks from Jari Love's ""Get Ripped: Slim & Lean"" workout. Kari is joined by four female exercisers set against a soft yellow and coral-lit background.

Kari is such a lithe and graceful fitness instructor. Her more choreographed movements offer a pleasing challenge and don't ""look"" stupid like I've seen on some other exercise vidoes - particularly when its obvious that the instructor isn't a dancer yet is leading a dance aerobic video. Kari however, is both, and it shows in all of her artsy yet purposeful movements.

I would label this as an intermediate to advanced aerobic workout (it's especially advanced if you combine both segments) of moderate impact, that not only requires a lot of energy to pull through, but a lot of dedication to master. Not long into the first workout, Kari herself is shining with sweat!

I'd definitely recommend this video to anyone who enjoys both step and floor aerobics that are more complex, well-choreographed and offer a fun cardio challenge.",1168732800,17,1446,4.987551867219917
