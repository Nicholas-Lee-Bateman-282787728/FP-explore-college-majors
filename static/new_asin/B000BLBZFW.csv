2423558,4,B000BLBZFW,"I'm a huge fan of Ronit Elkabetz, having seen her excellent work most recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-s-Visit/dp/B0013HL6ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band's Visit</a>&nbsp;(Bikur Ha-Tizmoret).  One of my favorite movies is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Marriage/dp/B00008H2NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Marriage</a>&nbsp;(Hatuna Meuheret).  She appears brilliantly there, too, as Lior Ashkenazi's love interest, heartbreakingly shunned by his family.  In her homeland, Ms. Elkabetz's signature role is that of downtrodden, sickly prostitute Ruthie in this look at Tel Aviv's seamy side from director Keren Yedaya.

As outstanding as Elkabetz is here, this is Dana Ivgy's movie. She portrays Ruthie's daughter 'Or'.  The review on these pages that nailed it is the one comparing this movie to the Japanese release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nobody-Knows/dp/B000A5044C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nobody Knows</a>&nbsp;- these are two works in which the children are forced in a hurry to become adults.  And, with Ruthie as a role model, you can pretty much guess Or's career path.

Ivgy - an Israeli beauty in the Aya Koren mold - also appeared indelibly in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Wings/dp/B000255L98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Wings</a>&nbsp;(Knafayim Shvurot), a movie that appears near the top of my growing list of recommendations for great Israeli cinema.  This is a country that punches way above its weight when it comes to the quality of its movies.

2423559,3,B000BLBZFW,"Note: Hebrew with English subtitles.

Released in '04 'Or, My Treasure' is a bittersweet tale of Or (Dana Ivgy) a young eighteen year old Israeli girl trying to graduate from high school and earn enough money to support herself and her aililng prostitute Mother. As her repeated efforts to keep her Mom from returning to her chosen profession continue to fail she begins to act out her frustrations in an unhealthy manner all to similar to what she has been fighting against.

Dana Ivgy delivers a sensitive and sensual performance as the troubled Or. Her interior and exterior struggle to be better than her surroundings is thwarted at every turn and the quiet disperation overtaking her once stalwart resolve is sublty and brilliantly displayed in both her facial expressions and body language. The film is a little on the slow side and the storyline and content is definitely adults only. What made this film for me was the heartfelt performance by the talented Miss. Ivgy.

My rating: 3 1/2 Stars.",1185580800,4,1001,4.876470588235295

2423561,3,B000BLBZFW,"Amazingly realistic story that starts out as a grim but heartening story of a young girl's attempt to reform her lazy mother. Having just left the hospital, 'Ruthie' (the mother) wiggles into her hot pants and prepares to go back to turning tricks no the street.

Ruthie is too old to get a 'regular' job in a proper brothel and her street customers frequently give her physical violence in lieu of a tip. These are more than enough reasons for teen daughter 'Or' to step and 'play' parent by locking her mother inside the apartment and forcing mom to start a new job as a cleaning lady.

Both actresses give compelling performances but the more 'Or' does for Ruthie the more she realizes that the 'apple doesn't fall far from the tree' in terms of seeing the opportunities that prostitution can offer a young woman when the alternative is working long hours as a pot scrubber in a restaurant.

This is not a formula movie like ""thirteen"" and has both humor and poignancy galore. Check it out!!!

2423562,4,B000BLBZFW,"Four stars (with flaws) for it's unapologetic exploration of a difficult subject and the real world implications of the choices available to these women. It was well paced, believable and troubling. The only aspect about it that gives me pause was how it glossed over the motivations of the characters without offering any background information as to how they got there. I understand that the girl struggled with self image (a byproduct of being raised by a prostitute) yet she was far more functional, capable and mature than her mother. Her lack of self seemed out of character with what was portrayed otherwise. I accept that perhaps the point of it is to suggest that this trait trumps all others. I just feel like either I missed something or they didn't give enough information. Still, a very solid portrayal of a universal reality of life. The film remains neutral to the issues and respects the viewer enough to let them decide what they should feel about it.",1385337600,2,968,4.802395209580839

2423566,5,B000BLBZFW,"The movie Or (My Treasure), is an Israeli film based on a teenage  girl whose mother's name is Ruthie. Ruthie has been in the oldest  profession known to mankind for 20yrs, prostitution. The film deals with how a mother daughter relationship can either make a daughter, or break a daughter. At first glance, the movie presented itself as a teenage girl who rigorously tried  to keep her mother from turning tricks on the dirty street corners and rats infested alleys in an obviously inner city where mostly poor people resides. There are no other family members whom the girl can turn to, however, she does have a teacher who deeply cares about her well being, and Or confides  in her on a regular basis, until Or also fell prey to her mother's demons, and no longer wants her teacher's advices.

While Or should be enjoying her teenage years hanging out with friends,  instead she is out trying to make ends meet by becoming the mother to her own mother. Or is a student, who is also employed at a local restuarant. The restaurant is owned by her boyfriend's  family. But lets not be blind to the fact that a restuarant job cannot pay all the houshold bills, therefore, this is not the only job Or tries to juggle. Or also collects cans and bottles to help fit the bills. This is the beginning of the film.

As Or ultimately tries to rid her mother of the street walking life by working numerous jobs,  all effort failed. In the middle of the film everything went dowhill when her beloved boyfriends's mother pays Or's mother Ruthie a visit at their apartment. The meeting was for Or to end her relationship with her boyfriend because her boyfriend's mother  foresees that Or would eventually become a prostitute just like her mother, and her  forcast was right on the dime, because right after this intial meeting, Or started turning tricks in order to pay the rent.

This film did not give justice to viewers who were probably seeking a happy ending. Instead, Or manifested a self  fulfilling prophecy, or some would call it irony at its worst. Because in the end, she tried to save her mother by turning to the very sickness that created her mother into a sexual street addict.  The film ended with Or and another young girl at a bachelor party, where they are hired to give a soon to be groom a time of his life. This movie is not for young children, view with cautious.",1357689600,,2375,4.544600938967136

2423568,5,B000BLBZFW,"This story had heart and soul and a real sense of family. The relationship between mother and daughter was well developed in a way. I can see the reasoning behind both characters' actions throughout the story. But it was a little unclear of why they were in the situation they were in, and why they didn't do something to remedy it. I didn't particularly like the choices the characters made near the end of the movie, but not all stories are happy and not everyone makes the right choices. At least, the choices they made in this movie were backed by actions that had occurred. The other two movies I reviewed today there was no real reason or point to the decisions the characters make, and in this one there are. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to a lot of people. Some of the acting is less the stellar but after all it is an indy film. But I can see why it did well at festivals.",1346889600,,895,4.270588235294118

2423570,4,B000BLBZFW,"This is a movie about the sacrifices a young girl has to make in the name of love and the drama in ""Or, my Treasure"" lies in the slow build-up of watching Or, a young girl, care for her prostitute mother Ruthie. This forced reversal of roles takes its inevitable toll on Or. She scurries around doing everything she can to get her mother off the streets, while trying to live as normal a life as possible. From falling in love with the neighbours son to washing piles of filthy dishes in a small cafe, Or struggles against the tide of her mother's legacy: sexual promiscuity.

As Ruthie compulsively walks a path of self destruction, Or fights against the realities of a marginalised life and holds on to her innocent hopes of saving her mother and finding a normal love. But life on the streets is as hard as it is addictive to Ruthie and Or is finally forced to make an impossible choice.

Performances by both Dana Igvy as Or and Ronit Elkabetz as her streetwalker mother, Ruthie, are superb and well-supported by secondary actors. English sub-titles were good. Keren Yedaya's sensitive and fine directing doesn't flinch from the tough reality of the seamier side of life, but also portrays the people who live in those dark shadows with compassion and a lack of moral judgement that is commendable.",1302393600,,1302,4.656521739130435
2423571,4,B000BLBZFW,"""Or: My Treasure"" (originally released in 2004, available on DVD in the US since 1006; 100 min.) is another highly regarded movie out of Israel. I sort of stumbled onto this one, after having watched several other Isralei movies recently and Amazon's useful feature ""if you liked this, we might suggest that"" pointed me in this direction.

""Or: My Treasure"" brings the story of Or, an 18 yr. old high school girl who at the beginning of the movie is seen picking up her mom from the hospital. It's only later that we learn her mom was there to treat depression, and that she is in fact a veteran street prostitute who is now deparately trying to change her life (style). Or finds a job for her mom, and takes care of her in every which way, on top of going to school and keeping a job in the restaurant owned by her boyfriend's dad. Without revealing details, events come unraveling in the last 30-40 min. of the movie. You'll just have to see it for yourself.

I really enjoyed this movie. The movie proceeds at glacial speed, and keeps angle-edits and camera movement to an absolute monimum. What a delight it is to have a scene unfold over several minutes and to let the actors do the acting without interference from overly aggressive editing. The performances of the two lead actresses are outstanding, and it is with good reason that Dana Ivgy (who plays the teenager) won a number of accolades for this, including I believe the Israeli equivalent of an Oscar. Meanwhile ""Or: My Treasure"" is highly recommended!",1295481600,,1517,4.614814814814815
