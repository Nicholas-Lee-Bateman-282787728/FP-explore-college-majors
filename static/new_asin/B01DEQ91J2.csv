8755772,3,B01DEQ91J2,I hope they update the website soon but this is to warn ALL other potential buyers that there IS NOT ANY ENGLISH DUB.  I know you anime purists out there hate dubs but to those that don't it is nice to know for SURE if there is one or not one.  It is better to have the details of these dvds be accurate.  Other than that though the series itself is pretty good.,1504828800,2,362,3.9315068493150687
8755773,5,B01DEQ91J2,More good work from a great artist and author. I feel it matches the manga fairly good. I'm glad I got it:),1485475200,,107,3.909090909090909
8755774,4,B01DEQ91J2,"Kyoukai No Rin-ne is the latest from world renowned manga artist and author Rumiko Takahashi, the mind behind other such amazing works as Urusei Yatsura, Inuyasha and Ranma 1/2. Kyoukai no Rinne is a creative, if not always completely seamless blend of comedy, romance, and a little action. For those familiar with her work you know what to expect although it may seem a little slow and dry to newcomers.

The story of Kyoukai no Rin-ne follows the lives of two high school students, Sakura Mamiya, a girl who's been able to see spirits ever since she was young and Rokudo Rinne, a broke half shinigami who's being forced to pay off his ancestors incredible monetary debts. The set up is amusing enough as the cast is quickly joined by the usual Rumic character archetypes you've come to know and love, Rokumon the plucky side kick, Jumonji the jealous rival, Ageha the other snooty yet largely harmless rival and so on and so forth. Rin-ne is far more subdued that Takahashi's other works and some may find that a bit boring, but the entire show is covered in a healthy dose of trademark Takahashi cynicism as all of the characters efforts end up impeded by celestial bureaucratic red tape or something similar. Fully happy endings rarely happen in the Rumic world and even happy events are usually played for laughs at a characters expense. Thankfully the series is relatively light on filler with only the second half of episode 3 going off course to follow its own plot line. The series is obviously geared towards a somewhat younger audience and the show will deliberately go out of its way to bludgeon you over the head with blatant narration of what's going on, and this can definitely be a bit grating.

The art and sound direction are ok, but not spectacular. There are some tracks, especially the opening theme that will linger in your mind for awhile and a few do really stand out. You'll come recognize a few of them, a few really beautiful tracks for mystical moments, a couple heart pounding ones for action moments and a couple comedic ones. While it's a really solid effort all around it never quite makes the leap into spectacular. The art, while well done does seem to eschew action for slower and more brief cuts and wide shots. Some scenes also briefly reuse footage and while it's not that jarring it does ruin the immersion just a little bit.

This box set contains the first 13 episodes on three disks and that's pretty standard practice. Sentai Filmworks has not included a dub for this show which is a shame, but not necessarily a deal breaker. I do hope that one day we'll get a proper dub for the show though. The extras are also incredibly sparse, clean openness and closings, but that's also standard practice in the industry these days. The picture looks crisp and clear and Sentai has done an excellent job with the bright packaging visuals.

All in all Kyoukai no Rin-ne is definitely not the best that the Rumic World has seen, but it's also not the worst. The story is fun and the characters are still as engaging as ever. If you enjoy Rumiko Takahashi and aren't bothered by the lack of an english dub this one is worth a look.",1475712000,3,3162,4.61101243339254
8755775,1,B01DEQ91J2,Don't feel like reading the show. I prefer to watch the show. When I pre-ordered this nothing in the description said it was Japanese only.,1471478400,4,139,4.6
8755776,3,B01DEQ91J2,"While it is nice enough,it is also very slow,light-weight and a bit of a snooze, not in any way deserving of a 17+ rating, more of a PG. I was so bored it took several tries to finish it. Would be nice for the elementary crowd.",1469836800,,227,3.9565217391304346
8755777,5,B01DEQ91J2,Yes yes yes yes and yes ! If you loved Inu Yasha you will absolutely adore this . Definitely an excellent addition to any anime collector's collection.  I always prefer the original voice cast over English dubs.  It give you that authentic experience.,1468368000,3,251,4.813953488372093
8755778,3,B01DEQ91J2,"Rin-Ne is the new franchise from Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Ranma 1/2 and Inu-Yasha. The manga has been in circulation for some time now, but the Anime only went into production last year, and Sentai Filmworks snagged the licensing rights for the series here in North America.

If you've liked Takahashi's previous franchises, you'll probably enjoy Rin-Ne. The concept is sort of a melding of the plots of her other works -- it revolves around a teenage girl who joins up with a mystical, otherworldly boy and engaging in wacky supernatural shenanigans. Classic Rumiko.

I like what I've seen and read of Rin-Ne, but I'm docking this release points because, quite frankly, I'm fed up with Sentai Filmworks' continuing laziness in the localization department. This is yet another release from the distributor that foregoes hiring an English voice cast in favor of including only the original Japanese audio and English subtitles.

That's fine for some -- maybe even the majority -- of the people who are going to watch this release, but I'm one of those people who have always preferred an English dub to reading subtitles, even if the dub is bad. I want to watch the show, not read the show. And so the fact that Sentai Filmworks can't be bothered to put in the extra time and money to hire an English cast puts me off laying down money to purchase this release, particularly given that the subtitled episodes can be easily accessed, legally, on Crunchyroll.

I think it's a shame that Viz Media opted to sit this franchise out, as they've released most of Takahashi's other franchises for home consumption over the years, and they've always included both an English dub and the original Japanese audio. Why couldn't Sentai FIlmworks be bothered to do the same?

If you're fine with a straight subtitled localization, then by all means purchase this release. But if, like me, you prefer having an optional English dub on your home media collection, vote with your wallet. Give this set a pass.",1464912000,14,1995,4.855882352941176
