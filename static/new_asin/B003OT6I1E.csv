8401701,5,B003OT6I1E,"This is a particularly rewarding concert and contains close to definitive versions of all items.

As regards the actual performances and artists concerned - the conductor, Temirkanov, is a highly experienced Russian conductor and has already appeared on Blu-ray where he conducts most of a gala concert at St. Petersburg. Curiously the Shostakovich Festive Overture is the same opening piece with the Russians playing even faster but not quite so well recorded. Both versions are excellent and exciting. Temirkanov's style is that of a disciplined conductor who knows how to get a dramatic and exciting response from players who very much rise to the occasion. He is also an extremely attentive accompanist. In this case he responds to every nuance in Argerich's definitive performance of the Ravel concerto. You will not hear better. Nor are you likely to hear a more compelling version of the Prokofiev suites. You have to go back 50 years to a famous version on CD of Ancerl conducting an inspired Czech Philharmonic to get a performance of this calibre.

Martha Argerich, of course, is well-respected as one of the outstanding pianists of her generation - some would say the outstanding pianist of almost any generation! Added to this, she has an enviable reputation for her interpretation of this Ravel concerto. Among her rare CD performances is her version of the concerto accompanied by Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic. This current performance is by no means its inferior in terms of execution and in addition it brings an unmistakable 'live occasion' excitement as well as the pleasure of seeing Argerich actually in concert. Her Chopin Mazurka encore is an exercise in perfection.

The imaging is crisp with involving and detailed camera work typical of the experienced Paul Smaczny and his team. The sound is presented in excellent DTS-HD 5.1 as well as stereo.

In summary, in my opinion this is a particularly fine concert with outstanding performances of major repertoire and recorded very well indeed. It is very likely that this will give considerable pleasure and satisfaction to the great majority of purchasers. It seems completely reasonable therefore to rate this as a 5 star issue on any count.",1343520000,4,2220,5.107438016528926
8401702,5,B003OT6I1E,"Let's get the obvious part of this out of the way.  This is a really well shot video of a really well played concert.  The performance of the Shostakovich Festive Overture sparkles.  The Ravel concerto gets one of the finest performances I have ever heard.  The Chopin Mazurka, offered by Argerich as an encore, made me want to rush over to the piano and play it. And the excerpts from the Romeo and Juliet Suites by Prokofiev, well it just doesn't get much better than this.  Wonderful music, great pianist, master conductor and outstanding orchestra.  What more is there to say?

Quite a lot, actually.  There are whys and wherefores.

First the video.  I usually run the other way when presented with a filmed concert.  So often, the director has no understanding of the music and cuts incessantly from a full orchestra shot to a solo, to the conductor making faces only a chimp's mother could love, back to another soloist, to the string section while the woodwinds play the theme, to the audience - why?? - and so on.  It makes me dizzy, it creates rhythms that conflict with those of the music, and I am so distracted by the visual antics that I have no idea what I've heard, or whether I liked it.

Not this one.  The director clearly took great pains to make what he showed me make musical sense.  What is more, he often highlighted musicians who were playing counterpoints and sub-themes as the conductor brought out an interesting inner line in the music.  They must have gone over the score together and planned out the shot sequences very carefully, and very intelligently.  I found the visual aspect added greatly to my appreciation of the music and the performances.

I have heard Argerich play the Ravel G Major Concerto many times over the years.  She just keeps getting better.  She plays the piece on this DVD as someone who knows it so intimately that every phrase is approached like the delighted greeting of an old and dear friend.  Temirkanov conducts the same way, leading, shaping, sculpting, with patience and appreciation at every turn.

Which brings me to the ultimate wherefore.  Both pianist and conductor are mature adults with many years of experience behind them.  The knowledge and understanding of the music, of their craft, and of their purpose are not to be found in the young.  This is not to say that the young cannot make wonderfully beautiful music.  But there is nothing in this world like the playing of someone who is able to draw on a lifetime of acquired wisdom and take the time to smile about it.

This is a DVD to which I will return again and again, not only for the beautiful music and playing, but for lessons in beauty.",1282003200,36,2671,4.627659574468085
8401703,4,B003OT6I1E,"I purchased this recording at the same time as the simultaneously released Helene Grimaud/Jurowski/Chamber Orchestra of Europe DVD recording. They could not be more different, especially the central adagio. Grimaud nails this movement in my opinion. It is simply magical. The first movement belongs to Argerich (much more jazzy) and the last movement is a tie. The Stockholm orchestra is much more ""vulgar"" and the recording is more ""in your face"" than the COOE with Grimaud. But both are worth owning. I disagree with Scott Morrison (whose views I usually agree with) on the CD/DVD comparisons. If ever a DVD is worth it's weight, it's watching a great pianist in action.

I also liked the Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet selection. The slightly slower tempi work well here, I think. The only other version of this is on a 4 disc set with Abbado/BPO (European Concerts).Picture and sound just OK, performance good.

Just let me confess that as a classical music nut for 50 years, the joy of watching the individual musicians play their parts is an absolute revelation, so maybe I'm a little more forgiving about imperfection in performance.

Buy this DVD!!",1281052800,12,1152,4.989583333333333
8401704,3,B003OT6I1E,"Every year the Nobel Prize committee makes arrangements for a gala concert in the Stockholm Concert Hall, the same hall where the prizes are awarded. In 2009 the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic (New York Philharmonic conductor Alan Gilbert's old orchestra of which he is now 'Conductor Laureate') was led by Yuri Temirkanov in a concert that featured the Ravel G Major Piano Concerto with Martha Argerich as soloist. The concert opens with Shostakovich's Festive Overture, in a performance that, although it glittered (that's Shostakovich's orchestration, no doubt), never quite caught fire. Then Ms Argerich came on to play that quintessentially French concerto, the two-handed one by Ravel. Argerich was her usual scintillating self, but there were some oddities. For instance, in the very beginning of the Adagio middle movement, when the right hand comes in, its first note sounds well before the presumably simultaneous left hand bass note is played. And then in that gloriously long lyrical opening passage for the solo piano there are tempo irregularities that, for me, are pointless and irritating. I simply cannot get the sound of Arturo Benedetto Michelangeli's classic recording out of my head;  he played that middle movement with absolute tempo regularity and yet brought to it a plaintive emotionality that Argerich does not manage. In the outer movements, though, Argerich is appropriately flashy and, interestingly, metrically correct. The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic's winds, so important in this concerto, are stellar. So are the important percussion bits.

Argerich ends the first half of the concert ends with a tiny encore -- Chopin's Mazurka in C, Op. 24, 2 -- played with wit and the right kind of rhythmic swagger.

The all-orchestral second half is given over to excerpts from two of Prokofiev's Suites from the Romeo and Juliet ballet: Suite I -- I Montagues and Capulets; II The young Juliet; III Friar Laurence; IV Dance; V Romeo and Juliet before parting; VII Romeo at Juliet's Grave, and Suite II - II Scene; V Masks; VII Death of Tybalt. As you can see no attempt is made to followed the arc of the story of the ballet. I found it to be a little ponderous overall. As a performance I much prefer the CD containing all three Romeo and Juliet suites conducted by Neeme Jrvi&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prokofiev-Romeo-and-Juliet-Suites-Nos-1-3/dp/B002EYBNT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet Suites Nos. 1-3</a>. All of which brings up the whole question of whether a DVD of a orchestral performance is something that has value above an audio-only CD. I have my doubts, although I do love to see really great conductors leading really great orchestras; that is, I fear, not the case here.

A lukewarm recommendation, primarily for those who love to watch (and hear) Argerich play.
