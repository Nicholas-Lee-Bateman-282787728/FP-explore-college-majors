8066264,5,B0009S8UYG,"I bought this because somehow, in my moving I lost this volume. I loved it when I watched it many years go, and was excited to share it my daughter and her husband. They are watching the series and are learning so much about understanding the dynamics of their relationship, and their differences. Gary Smalley's insight into men and women is truly amazing. He uses love, common sense, and humor, to help you understand and strengthen your relationship and marriage.
