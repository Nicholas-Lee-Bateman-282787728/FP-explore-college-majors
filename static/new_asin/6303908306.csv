Even after seeing this film for like the tenth time Im still unsure of exactly who/ what/ where/ how/ why went down the way it did but the film plays with us at every level, and its wonderful. Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey in his breakout role), hauled in by smug Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) who was investigating an alleged drug trafficking operation that left a lot of bodies strewn around a docked ocean vessel, weaves a web of lies and deception with lines of truth to satisfy the cops simplistic line of understanding. Only after Kujan has released Kent back to the world believing that the serpentine street justice of criminals eating their own will swallow up Kent does Kujan realize after looking around his office and seeing bits of info and names strewn around it (like the name of Kobayashi on the bottom of a broken coffee mug that was the name Kent ascribed to nefarious Kaiser Sozes lawyer) that Kent wove a story pulled from all of those little bits, plucked them out of the air as it were, and sold Kujan on it all.

722513,5,6303908306,"Easily my favorite movie for any number of reasons- a swift moving, intricate plot that hides things you can be surprised by well after knowing the final twist, stylish camera work, clever dialogue. But a few decades in I think I will always love the lightning-in-a-bottle aspect to it that epitomizes the possibilities of movies: proof that anyone can knock it out of the park at least once. In retrospect, most of the talent here never quite made A list, behind the camera or in front of it. Really, if you're interested enough to read the behind the scenes stuff, a lot of the best moments here were happy accidents, not planning.
That said, who cares? Everything in this movie somehow clicked in just the right way, from beginning to end. Objectively, there are very few flaws to be found. Subjectively, it remains the one movie I can't make background noise, or ignore, or skip for a few years until I forget about it.",1502582400,,923,4.634146341463414

722696,2,6303908306,"Released in 1995 and directed by Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects is a crime drama/mystery about five thugs who decide to team up and get revenge on the police (Keven Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Baldwin, Keven Pollak and Benicio Del Toro). After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Sze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and hes interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Sze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Szes right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs.

This is a ""twist ending"" flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just ""wait for the twist,"" it isn't actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey's character is somewhat interesting. As such, it's next to impossible to care about them. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn't really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I'm not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren't worth it. The film didn't make me care enough to watch again.

Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination.  And, for me, the convoluted journey in The Usual Suspects is just dull and laborious.  If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but thats not the case. Then theres something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing hip tough-tawkin hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign.

I cant believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; the movie's seriously overrated.

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City.

GRADE: C- (a strong 2/5 Stars or weak 3/5 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT***

I want to emphasize that this review does not criticize the film based on pretending to ""know the twist all along"" (as stated above, I was able to figure out who the mystery man likely was, but not the other details). The problem is that the entire movie is based around listening to a guy make up a bunch of stuff. Gee, so all we really know is there was a ship that got torched and Kevin Spaceys character doesn't really have a limp. Okay, thanks for wasting my time with everything else. Great storytelling (rolling my eyes).",1480377600,,3000,4.613508442776736

722893,4,6303908306,"In my old neighborhood at least among the corner boys of my own generation that I hung around with at the variety store that was our headquarters everybody loved a con man, if, naturally, not being conned. You know we loved guys who could spin up a tale out pure cloth and produce some gold, dinero, moola for their efforts (there may have been female con artists but I don't recall any since they were spending their time leading us a merry chase in a different way and if that was the case then almost every gal around the town was a con artist). So Kevin Spacey as the beautifully characterized Verbal Kint in the film under review, The Usual Suspects, would have been worshipped as a living god back in the day. No false idols need apply as we lighted the candles to one of our own.

Heres why. After a horrendous ships explosion one of the two survivors of what apparently was a gang war one Verbal Kint was being interrogated by the feds, by a customs agent since there was suspicion that the war had been over drugs or some other contraband. Through a series of flashbacks Verbal leads the agent on a verbal merry chase about what had occurred at the docks. He had been among five usual suspects who were in a police line-up in New York who had through a series of adventures, successful adventures in grabbling dough, and had been hired by an unknown master criminal to do some work for him after his agent made a very forceful case for why they should do sos if they valued their lives, and of anybody even remotely related to them. After initially balking at the deal they took it on when the guy who seemed to be the leader of the group, Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrnes, committed to the caper. They went to L.A. to meet their adversaries and consummate the deal. Then all hell broke loose on the ship and everything and everybody went boom boom.

Everybody but Verbal who lived to tell the tale. See here is the beauty of a guy like Verbal. He put himself out in public as a small time con, a crip nobody (that crippled up part as it turned out he was faking, another beautiful move) in the company of serious desperados like Keaton and the other hombres so nobody caught the mis-directions he was feeding everybody from his comrades to the fuzz. He wove a big-time tall tale to the agent about an evil Mister Big who had been manipulating everything and whom when Verbal confessed who it was turned out to the now deceased Keaton. Except, well, except that well-woven tale was all fluff because Mister Big was none other than guess who. Yeah Verbal walked into the sunset with all the dough, with immunity and with all the feds scratching their heads. Hail Verbal.",1465776000,,2683,4.440162271805274

723105,3,6303908306,"This is an 'old' film to me, which I binge watched as part of a with a couple of other 'classics' before the films I'm familiar with (slick graphics and lots of explosions and close up shaky camera) came to be. I heard a lot of hype, and I loved crime/heist type of plots, so I was all in.

The film is pretty straightforward until the end, with alright acting and a simple story with one mystery: who's pulling all the shots? I didn't really care or deffintriate between the characters, but I felt a brief twinge of sadness when one was shot. But even if I was studied in all five of the 'usual suspects' and felt for each of them dearly, I doubt it would have changed my feelings about the ending.

It was crazy disappointing. The thing about a film like the ""usual suspects"" is that how good the entire movie and plot is practically defined by the ending, make or break it style. If the twist ""brought it all together"" and came to some emotionally satisfying conclusion, the movie would have been instantly ten times better. If the twist or ending was lackluster or totally unpredictable and nonsensical, then it was an alright film with a bad ending.

And this ending was entirely unpredictable. There is no way you could simply assume every single scene you had seen up til that point was all imaginary, ""all just a dream"" or elaborately made up lie. It was a pointless twist. If the main character, the villain I suppose, was just spinning a yarn, what was the point?? That means you automatically can't trust any of the scenes to be real, all you know is he got a bunch of criminals in trouble but the how and why is now rendered a complete mystery, because everything you just saw is fibbed, as is proven by the multitude of handy brand name objects lying around telling you nothing he said was true, and in fact, made up the moment he saw ""microsoft"" cross the computer screensaver or whatever.

The other thing about twists is they need to be foreshadowed. It needs to be plausibly foreshadowed where all the characters act in a way that makes sense when the foreshadowing pays off. If EVERYTHING WAS FICTIONAL then you don't even know if the characters were even privy to whatever random piece of information the bad guy made up in his story where he made the good guys react to things. It was impossible to foreshadow, and it DEFINITELY WASNT.

So the entire end scene was scripted like a clever ""gotcha hahaha"" but it was really like a stranger coming up to you in a place you've never been before and saying, ""I'm going to show you where the bathroom is,"" and leading you through some hallways. Then they lead you in front of a broom closet and stop. While you stare at the broom closet door, the stranger gives you an overly self-satisfied smirk before saying ""I TRICKED YOU. THIS ISNT THE BATHROOM, ITS THE BROOM CLOSET.""

What? How on earth was I supposed to know otherwise? It's not clever when there's nothing to be clever about. There was no trick. It was a one way road to a brick wall saying ""I LIED."" The brick wall is not clever.",1458604800,,3053,4.442857142857143

It has splendid acting, an unusual story line; it is filled with suspense and many twists and turns, and a surprise ending. It focuses on a detective who wants to prove that a certain criminal is still alive. He interrogates one of this man's criminal band, supposedly the sole survivor of a supposedly botched-up robbery. The five-man band was supposed to hijack a ship with millions of dollars of dope and steal $91 million. We are told at the beginning that the dope was not there, nor was the money. The sole survivor was able to get political protection and immunity. Why? We watch wondering what happened and who was the strange man who orchestrated this deal, and why did he do so.",1447804800,,770,4.62043795620438

723794,4,6303908306,"Clever and engaging. Not a deep film, but about as thought-provoking as a crime whodunit can be. The elevation of the Spacey character into mythic proportions is very appealing and gives the film an other-worldly quality, unexpected in a crime drama. A few things about the premise are not very credible. The idea that someone could wield immense power, with next to no traceable connections is a bit hard to imagine, given the way humans work. And the way in which the NY detective discovers at the last minute, by noticing things on the bulletin board and the bottom of a broken cup, that he's been told an arabian tale isn't believable. But we're willing to forgive those stretches, because the idea behind the story is so refreshingly different. Worth seeing.",1436486400,,763,4.8320610687022905

724067,4,6303908306,"I watched this movie when it first came out. In those days I had not written any screenplays, therefore, I considered this film an
intricate jewel on par with the graphic novel 'Watchmen'.

In those days I was too young to realize the social commentary in this film, or for that matter any film. I thought it was quality entertainment.

I personally don't like 'The Usual Suspects', yet I've given it four stars. Superb editing, cast, yet despite an Oscar for Kevin Spacey; the
performances wrung out of this ensemble just does not do it for me.

A buy (meh)

724744,3,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects

This film won 2 Academy awards in 1995 (for screenplay, and for Kevin Spacey).  It is a crime drama.  Right off the bat it starts out confusing, with 2 different crimes shown sequentially, and no clear connection between the two.  The remainder of the film explains the connection, as the audience tries to guess what was going on.

Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, Spacey, Benigno del Toro and others star in this film.  If you enjoy films whose characters are mostly criminals, you'll probably like it.  Clearly it has a lot of fans since out of over 1,000 reviews the great majority give it 5 stars and about 0.5% give it only 1 star.  I won't give the plot away, but will say I don't usually enjoy films most of whose characters are criminals though there are exceptons.  I didn't think this was nearly as significant as, say, Pulp Fiction.  I will concede it may be Spacey's best performance, and that it can take several viewings to put everything together.",1417219200,,1016,4.721590909090909

725830,5,6303908306,Great storyline and actors. The story plot flowed very well. It kind of represents today's society in that sometimes things are right in front of us and we missed it completely.,1403308800,,177,4.741935483870968
725831,4,6303908306,"Evergreen thriller with spectacular acting job from Kevin Spacey. One of Spacey's masterpiece. So many friends had asked me the same question over and over again, ""What! You haven't seen the Usual Suspects?"" So finally I watched it ans understood the imperative behind the question.",1402963200,,282,5.288888888888889

725919,5,6303908306,"Written by Ron's wife. I gave the movie 5 stars simply because I ADORE Kevin Spacey and would watch him recite the phone book!! He gives an outstanding performance as always and the rest of the cast is also very good. But the movie, at least for me, was a little hard to follow and somewhat confusing at times. But, as I said, I will watch anything with Kevin in it and his performance as Verbal Kint is quite captivating. Found it interesting that it was one of Bryan (X-Men) Singer's earliest directing jobs.",1402358400,,510,4.4361702127659575
725920,4,6303908306,enjoyed this film I would recommend this to a friend.  I liked all the actors in the film  The plot was exciting,1402185600,,112,4.045454545454546
725921,5,6303908306,"Most people can recall their first ""ah-ha"" moment in a movie and for many of them, it's the Usual Suspects. Twists and turns and amazing story telling from one of the finest actors around (Spacey) fill this movie from start to finish. Be sure not to let anyone spoil you if you haven't seen this yet - and if you have, be sure never to spoil it for anyone else!",1402185600,,361,4.171428571428572

725924,1,6303908306,I tried to watch this movie but it stopped playing every couple minutes so I finally gave up. It would have probably been more stars if I could have actually watched it.,1401753600,,169,4.3125
725925,4,6303908306,"It's a good movie, and they chose an interesting group of mobsters. I know I've seen part of it before, and maybe I just watch too many movies, but I had an idea of who was the mastermind before the end.",1401667200,,203,3.975609756097561
725926,5,6303908306,"The first time through is fun, but rewatching it is even better because you admire the genius and brutality of Soze as played by Spacey",1401580800,,135,4.44
725927,1,6303908306,When a movie has to start with all F words I have no inspiration to see any more of it. It was probably a good movie if they could cut the swear words at least to a minimum. I was looking forward to it too because I liked a few of the actors.,1401494400,2,242,3.5849056603773586
726016,3,6303908306,"Hard to tell exactly what the heck is going on. Maybe other viewers are smarter than I but I truly doubt that most people could, after viewing the movie, tell exactly what the heck it was all about, that is, exactly the true plot. Fine acting, moved along at a fast but confusing pace.",1401235200,,285,4.296296296296297
726017,4,6303908306,"We originally watched this on VHS about 15 years ago, and it is still a great film.  Highly recommended.

Also, the streaming was excellent, and I really appreciate the closed captions.",1401235200,,185,4.935483870967742

726019,5,6303908306,A fast and fun loving tomp. Entertaining with a twist you may just not even know to watch for. A must see.,1401062400,,106,3.8636363636363638
726020,5,6303908306,One of the beat. One of the few movies I can enjoy time after time. Every time there is another facet reveled that makes the story more complete.,1400976000,,145,4.214285714285714
726021,5,6303908306,"Five star for one of the best movies I have seen (again). Loved the story, cast, direction, and plot. Recommend it for all ages and audiences.",1400976000,,142,4.5

726024,1,6303908306,"No exaggeration.  The premise is about a supposedly stupid cripple brought in to a police station to talk about a mysterious criminal named ""Keyser Soze"".  The story is told in flashbacks.

What happens is that five different minor criminals are brought into a police lineup for a crime none of them were involved with.  It turns out the real reason was to bring them into a sort of vigilante group to bring down other criminals.  After a bit of this, they are told about a mystery man named ""Keyser Soze"", a very vicious murderer.  Who is he, and could he be one of their group?

The movie is slow and overlong, the acting is at best mediocre, and the movie's surprise ending suggests that the story told be the supposedly stupid cripple might have been less than honest, or not honest at all.  So what was the whole point?",1400889600,6,824,4.483221476510067
726025,5,6303908306,Suspenseful. Thought provoking and an excellent cast. Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne give stellar performances. This will keep you guessing,1400803200,,139,6.0
726076,5,6303908306,"IF IT HASN""T BEEN SPOILED FOR YOU YET, KEEP IT THAT WAY!  If it has been spoiled, like it was for me, this is still an incredible movie. The way that the movie is done is a worthy set up to one of the great twists in movie history.

This movie is an excellent crime thriller/drama where the viewer is trying to figure out what happened as well as everyone else in the film.  It starts with the round up of a group of 5 career criminals, the ususal suspects, for a line up trying to identify the one who stole a truck of guns.  These men, for various reasons such as anger at the line up and money, join up and pull a job, which leads to another, much more dangerous opportunity.

This story is told by the film's narrator, one of the men from the line up, after the events in the story take place to a cop trying to get the truth.  If you like intrigue, drama, great dialogue and some gratuitous violence then this is the movie for you.",1400803200,,936,4.087431693989071
726077,5,6303908306,This movie is a amazing tale that you leaves one trying to figure it out when it is over. Things are definitely not a they seem. It is a superb show.,1400803200,,149,3.838709677419355
726078,2,6303908306,"The story, would have been very enjoyable, but the language throughout, detracted from my enjoyment of this film. I'm no prude by any means, but the constant use of some words was  a definite turn-off. Most people I know don't speak that way all the time, so it seemed unrealistic to me.",1400803200,,287,4.519230769230769

726080,5,6303908306,"If you can get by the profanity, which is properly used as this movie is about criminals, you will find this movie enjoyable and suspenseful.  One of my favorites.",1400630400,,163,4.620689655172414
726081,5,6303908306,"The entire cast is terrific, but any Kevin Spacey fan who has not see TUS is missing a great point in his career.

Make some popcorn and clear the calendar. Do this now.",1400544000,,169,4.121212121212121
726082,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects is so well done, it is worth watching it twice in a row just to pick up all the subtleties in it. The acting, directing and plot in the film all flow together to make it one of my personal favorites. I never get sick of this movie and seem to get something new each time I see it. If only the run of the mill action films carried this level of quality, the world would be a better place...",1400544000,,408,3.927710843373494
726083,5,6303908306,"This is one of the all time greats, with many classic lines -- ""he devil's best trick was to convince the world he didn't exist -- and like that (poof) . . . he's gone.""",1400544000,,169,3.857142857142857
726084,5,6303908306,"A movie you have to watch two or at least three times to fully appreciate.  Once is not enough.  Excellent movie, and it will keep you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.",1400544000,,182,4.027777777777778
726085,5,6303908306,Have seen this several times still love it. I would always recommended this movie no matter what type of genre your preference is.,1400544000,,130,4.695652173913044
726155,5,6303908306,"Usual Suspects has become a cult classic not only for its trick ending but for the excellent performances given by each of the protagonists, if they can be called that. Highly enjoyable even without Humphrey Bogart.",1400457600,,215,5.0
726156,4,6303908306,"I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch this move. There is a lot of narration and the plot takes many twists and turns, so you really have to be in the mood for a slow starting movie. A couple of the actors tend to mumble their lines which didn't help.  If you can get through the first part of the movie without falling asleep it gets fairly interesting and is worth watching.

It is a wobbler, three or four stars, depending on your mood.",1400457600,,447,4.126436781609195

726160,5,6303908306,I really enjoyed this one.  This was the first time I watched it although it was made about 20 years ago.  There is a nice complex timeline with a lot of flashbacks with really work to enhance the movie.  Highly recommended.,1400025600,,224,4.414634146341464

through out the film you think you know where it's going. Never really knowing who the killer is.........then WHAM!!!  And 24 hours later your mind is still untangling all that it thought it saw. Must watch again.",1399075200,,486,4.282608695652174

726289,5,6303908306,"This was probably the first and only movie I ever had to immediately watch again after it was over.  I remember thinking, Holy Crap!  I need to see that again.  Which I did that very night.  Watching on a VHS as soon as it rewound, I plopped it back in and watched it again.  Ive heard that this movie influenced a great many movies that followed its format of having a twist ending that no one expected.  I felt that this movie was amazing.  Its still one of my favorites.  It was well-acted (Spacey deserved the Oscar for this one), suspenseful, extremely entertaining and thought provoking, and was well paced.  I honestly cant think of anything negative to say about this movie.  If youve never seen it, it is definitely one that you want to check out.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching excellent movies.

The Usual Suspects is a detective story with hints of the supernatural featuring a fine case of character actors. The plot revolves around the efforts of a federal agent to determine who is responsible for the murder of a group of men engaged in a suspected drug deal gone bad at the waterfront port of San Pedro. The men are not only killed but burned beyond recognition during an explosion and fire at the pier. The story is told in retrospect, and through the lens of  federal officers interrogation of the only survivor, Verbal Kint, a small time con man with a deformed right leg, the only survivor of the night in question. The plot twists and turns and is slowly more and more absorbing as the figure of the mysterious and evil ""Keyser Soze"" takes shape as someone connected to the murders. The question is ""Who is Keyser Soze? Is he real, myth or a ruse? The tale builds to an offbeat surprise ending with different potential interpretations. I rarely enjoy a movie this much.

'The Usual Suspects' is a film I have heard about, and I finally got to view it. Now, this is a film that doesn't grab you right out of the box, you have to hang in there, and then decide if it was worth it.

The movie begins in Calif., where an explosion blows up a ship. It will take you awhile to realize that this is really the beginning of the film. There are so many complications, and characters to sort out. The New York based policeman, Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri thinks he knows who was involved, and he wants someone to fess up. He has one witness, a criminal named Verbal, played by Kevin Spacey. Kujan and Verbal stay in the office Kujan borrows. where The story is told in flashback. Five suspects who were picked up by the police, played by Gabriel Byrne, a cop gone bad trying to go good; Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollak, in addition to Spacey. None of these characters is going to give up anyone, ever. However,while in the same hail cell they plot a big crime, and this is where
we find the film.

A more convoluted film will be difficult to find. However, the cast of characters kept me in the game. The addition of Giancarlo Esposito, as the FBI agent, he, of 'Breaking Bad' fame, gave the film it's credence. We learn of a really bad guy, Koso, some sort of Polish mafia guy, who shot his own family to show how bad he is. Keeping up is the name of the game, and by the last give minutes the gig is up. I knew just as the film develops the last blow, what it was that kept us going. Ha Ha!

Some were good and some were bad. But I after seeing it, I could see how it's mixed (but majority was more on the positive side). This is one of those movies where you either hate it or you love it. But if you hated it, my imagination is that either a.) This is not your type of movie. or B.) You didn't see it through till the end (which I believe happened for most). If you find yourself watching this and feeling to waiver, DON'T! Stick it through until the end.

Maybe it was because it stars the always mediocre Stephen Baldwin. But, it seems this movie is enjoying a little bit of a cult following revival right now so I decided to check it out for free with prime.

Here's what I found, this movie is extremely slow moving for the first 45 minutes, and once the story finally starts, at 45 minutes in, it really doesn't pick up the pace. I cut my losses at an hour in and turned it off.

My friend pointed out that it felt very dated and said maybe that (slow) is just how story telling was in the 90s. I reminded her, many of the fairly widely accepted best movies of all time are from the 90s; Forrest Gump, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park; to name just a few.

I saw this on Netflix one day because I hadn't seen it before, and was thoroughly bored to tears. Like other 1 star reviews, I love the actors in this film, but the actual characters in the movie are far from like-able. I didn't care about any of them, and the reveal at the end pissed me off so much, because IMO you didn't know it until they spoon fed it to you. I've looked up on IMDb all the nods to why you should have known who the real killer was, however they are so tiny and minute. They kept showing a flashback to the night in question, but it's not even what really happened, so how are we supposed to figure out who the real killer is when they don't tell you what really happened until the very end. It's not a mystery, its some child telling you a lie the whole movie until the very end when they say, ""JUST KIDDING HE WAS KEYSER SOZE THE WHOLE TIME!""",1390262400,4,983,4.125

Can't say movie was great. As a mater of fact, I fell asleep after 15 miutes & woke up 10 minutes before the end credits. BAD acting, BAD story, VERY, VERY OVER-RATED. NOT worth renting.

The characters were poorly developed, dull and unmemorable. The movie is much too talky and convoluted and the ending is predictable.

The transfer to Blu-Ray is excellent, and clearly better than the very-good-for-DVD transfer on the DVD. However, the Blu-Ray edition does not contain any commentary or any extras except the trailer. I have watched the movie on DVD with the director's commentary, and it really added a lot to my enjoyment of this intricately plotted movie, including the commentary about Kevin Spacey's incredible handling of so many of the great scenes. I would still buy this, but if you are at all a film buff, I would also buy the DVD for the commentary, as well as several other extras. It will really add to your enjoyment of this noir classic, at a not unreasonable cost.

The story of a gang of robbers is told through the voice of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) from the time they form until the ""present"".  The characters are interesting, and there is enough action to keep things going along at an exciting pace.  The group starts out in New York, and end up in California trying to break up a drug deal on a freighter (not giving up any detail here).  Along the way, they become involved with a shadowy crime kingpin (a Moriarty-like character, for Sherlock Holmes fans).

727721,5,6303908306,"I saw The Usual Suspects in the movie theater when it was first released. Now, I watched it several more times courtesy of Amazon. Each time, I discover more subtlety, more intrigue. The plot centers around a group of criminals conned into doing a job for the legendary Keyser Souze (spelling?) who is no one to trifle with. Along with the way, they're caught up in overcoming their own demons even as they encounter new ones. But who's really pulling the strings. It's a challenge to reveal more without blowing the plot. Suffice it to say, the performances in this movie are nothing short of amazing. Then there is the direction. The director captures all the tension without slowing down the pace. He also reveals little things at a time, things you won't notice until you view The Usual Suspects at least two or three times. That's what makes this movie one to own. Watch it with your friends and see who figures it out first, and last. While there is some violence, it's in good taste, and not overdone. Nor are the few action sequences.

727830,5,6303908306,"The ultimate crime mystery there is, this movie is good on every level.

Never have I watched such an intriguing movie. Although the main plot develops slowly, all the sub plots along keep your mind guessing as to what is really happening. You have no idea why they are interrogating Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey).

Without spoiling anything, five thieves find themselves in the same lineup regarding a truck heist in New York. After they are released, they decide to get together for one job, a job that will get back at the cops of New York, and set the sailing off into eternal happiness. To get their payoff they have to go to California. When the person buying the goods offers a few more jobs that are extra juicy, these five thieves can't resist and the jobs that follow make the movie.

This is hands down Kevin Spacey's best performance. Him, along with Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne who also give extraordinary performances make this movie an all time classic as far as crime mysteries are concerned. Superb acting and an even better story line.

  I suppose it must be hard to make a crime show without violence, coarse language or gore but by and large this one did rest on it's storytelling merrits without overdoing it in these areas. But you wouldn't show this to a younger audience. But for this reason alone I had to give it a 4 star. I think a good crime yarn can have these negative aspects absent. Still like I say it was pretty tame in this department and stood very well on the story alone, and when there was this aspect it fit and wasn't gratuitous.. Frankly this aspect was virtualy a non factor, exept in the intrinsic nature of crime itself.
  That said I found this a gripping yarn that was intreaguing and interesting the entire show. I can't wait to watch it again, but don't want to watch it too soon as the way it unfolded was just easy enough to follow, but quick enough to keep you one your toes trying to keep up...and wonder if your were following it as good as you needed to. I can't wait to watch it again knowing what is revealed at the end.
  I suspect upon closer examimnation it's feasability might fall apart. Could the villain really be who he was, or does the story break apart upon closer examination as all too often does in this kind of intricate yarn.

727984,5,6303908306,"Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",1336608000,,1621,4.8768115942028984
727985,5,6303908306,"I first saw this polished gem of a film when I was thirteen. Of course at that age I was blown away by how cool and clever it was. And I think I always will have an affection for it, because despite not being as amazing as I thought, it is a genuinely smart and cool movie, nearly perfect within its own niche.

The 'usual suspects' are a group of career criminals rounded up to take some heat for a truck heist. Notable among them are Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt cop attempting to return to the straight and narrow, and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con-man. To make the best of a bad situation they plan a few jobs together. However, they quickly find themselves falling deeper and deeper into a web of violence woven by the mysterious master criminal Keyser Soze, who demands payment from all of them for past misdoings. Their story is told in flashback by Verbal to a zealous customs agent the morning after a disastrous attack on a ship in the harbour leaves him the only survivor.

I believe that the statutory limitation on spoilers must have been passed by now, but be warned if you continue reading.

A few people seem to see this as a standard crime caper with a twist ending, and one that means that the whole story does not make much sense. But it's not really about the story, it's about the fabrication of the story and what it says about the ego of the one telling the tale. The ending deconstructs the slick pretensions of 'cool' crime movies. The evil of Keyser Soze is revealed in the way he tells his own story. To his mind crime is a flashy world of wit, legendary figures, tragic decisions and ruthless exercise of the will. If you pay attention to the details of the story that must be taken to be accurate, they actually paint a picture of a sociopath who uses people and then brutally kills them. The trick this devil pulls is to make us believe that his actions make him more than a man, make him a mythical figure beyond normal humanity, thus bolstering his self-image.

I bought the The Usual Suspects Blu-ray thinking that all the special features on the Special Edition (standard DVD) would be included on the Blu-ray version. I don't know why I thought that. I guess it just makes sense for the Blu-ray version to include everything on the most advanced edition of the standard DVD plus the feature film on Blu-ray. Evidently, I was wrong because none of the special features on Special Edition of the Usual Suspects is on this Blu-ray version. If you have the Special Edition, you should hold on to it and get this Blu-ray version only for the sake of Blu-ray quality picture and audio. There is also the Blu-ray book version you may want to check out, which is more expensive but may offer special features, extras, etc. missing from this one.

728043,5,6303908306,"I've loved this film ever since it came out, I'm just now getting around to reviewing it. This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades! Bryan Singer, working on a very low budget, delivers a high quality film that stands just as strong now as it did upon release in 1995.

The story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film.

Kevin Spacey, Gabrielle Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Torres, and Chaz Palminteri turn in tour-de-force performances in this stunning crime-caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the ""X-Men"" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and ""Apt Pupil"", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella.

The only other performance(s) from Spacey that I feel come anywhere as close to this is ""Glengary Glenn Ross"" and ""American Beauty"". Another awesome performance by Kevin Spacey is in the Clint Eastwood film classic ""Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil"". Awesome film! But this is his BEST in my opinion.

And, the film is SO unique! I really wished that director Bryan Singer would have stuck with this genre instead of wasting his talent with comic book films.
He could have been the OTHER great director named Bryan alongside the likes of Brian De Palma, but with the small difference in name spelling.
Too bad more films like this don't get made more often!

The story is so twisted and convoluted that at film's end, you're still left wondering WHO IS Keyser Soze?. Even when you think you have a grasp on things and have everything figured out (even after the film's final twist), it still leaves the viewer reeling, not really sure if they have figured out just WHO the real Keyse Soze is or not, if there even is a Keyser Soze.

And, that is how great film noir is supposed to work. Think ""The Big Sleep"", a story so twisted that allegedly the screenwriter didn't even know who 'done it' at the film's end. This is definitely a five star film (I would rate it higher if Amazon allowed such, giving it a ten or higher) that any film buff should add to their collection. I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece. Comparable in some ways to John Carpenter's ""In The Mouth of Madness' in that it spirals and twists into an ending that will leave you utterly breathless.

This film isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me. My cup of tea. This is a film that will still be talked about in another ten years from now.

Subsequent viewings are just as good as the first even though you know what happens, because the characters are so compelling and the story is so enthralling.

The first scene is a line-up for a trumped up charge and as they wait together a plot is hatched to combine forces.

Several crimes are committed successfully, leading up to one big hit for $91 million dollars.  Beyond that there is a sub-plot of Keyser Soze, a terrible, secretive, underworld killer gang leader that no one can prove is real, other than stories of his cold, horrendous temper and killing binges.

Because some of the dialogue is not easily understood, it was hard to keep an interest in most of the movie.  The final thirty minutes make the Usual Suspects worth watching, strange yet fascinating surprise ending.",1268438400,2,832,4.914285714285715

This movie describes in flashbacks how a group of 5 criminals is gently or not so gently persuaded to do a job for the mysterious Keyzer Sse, a master criminal, the great puppet player. Every cut offers some new take on reality, offers yet another look at the interpersonal dynamics between the main characters and always leaves the viewer with the feeling that something is still amiss, like that puzzle piece which nearly but not perfectly fits, this nagging doubt in the back of ones head about a story too perfect to be true.
And thus we follow this gang on their path towards self destruction. Slowly all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, slowly one realizes that each and every move of them had somehow been preordained, that even in their rebellion they were still following the masterplan of Keyzer Sse.

Christopher McQuarrie won a well-deserved Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this stylish, mesmerizing gangster thriller, which demands multiple viewings.

Directed by Bryan Singer, the story, told in flashback, tells of five criminals who meet in a New York police line-up, then form a gang to pull off multiple robberies.  They soon discover, however, that they are being manipulated by Keyser Soze, a much-feared, legendary master criminal who each has unknowingly wronged.

Gabriel Byrne, Best Supporting Actor winner Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak and Benicio Del Toro are the crooks, while Chazz Palminteri is the cop who has to figure out what happened when all but Spacey died while pulling their last job.  Pete Postlethwaite and Suzy Amis are also in the cast.

This 1995 release has one of the most memorable surprise endings in movie history.

MGM/UA's  ""Special Edition"" of THE USUAL SUSPECTS has deleted scenes, several featurettes that include new interviews with the cast and filmmakers and audio commentary by Singer and McQuarrie.

While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",1219190400,,925,4.578313253012048
728230,3,6303908306,"I will say that `The Usual Suspects' is entertaining, because to say otherwise would be a bold faced lie.  I won't say that it was deserving of all the hype it received, because to say that would also be a bold faced lie.  No, `The Usual Suspects' is a decent crime thriller that proves to have a `twist' ending that becomes more and more predictable as you start putting pieces together.  The script is probably the best and worst thing about this movie.  When you look at all the thought that went into constructing the plot (or lack there of) you can't help but be taken aback by the effort put into it, but when all is said and done the twist at the end seems very rudimentary and the overall concept of the film lacks that freshness that could have been achieved had the envelope been pushed a little further.

The film begins with a bang, or an explosion to be more precise.  A cargo ship goes up in flames and next thing you know we are brought back to how it all began, with five men standing in a lineup.  These five men include criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockey as well as one time cop Dean Keaton and small time crook Roger Kint, also known as Verbal (because he talks to much).  After the men meet the wheels are set in motion for something much more complicated (and possibly fabricated) than anything they've been involved with before; all of which boils down to a man named Keyser Soze.

The film is told in flashbacks by Verbal as he is interrogated after the ship explosion, he being the only survivor.  As Verbal weaves a thick web of truth, partial truth and absolutely no truth it is up to Dave Kujan to sort through it all to find out just who Keyser Soze really is.

The acting is truly hit or miss here, and I think the misses really took the overall experience of the film down a few notches.  The only real standout is Kevin Spacey who isn't even delivering his best (his performance in `Se7en' that same year is what should have garnered him the Oscar, not this one).  Among the decent are Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak and Chazz Postlewaite.  Stephen Baldwin is horrendous and Benicio Del Toro (an actor for which I am usually amazed by) is ridiculous here.  I understand creating a `character' and I can generally stand behind that, but his performance was so obnoxious and annoying that I loathed his presence on the screen.  Spacey at least develops a character that is interesting, and even though he has delivered much stronger performances in other films he really carries the bulk of this film on his shoulders, and the moments that do work, work because of him.

The film noir style is also a bit off here.  I love a good film noir, and films like `Chinatown', `The Griffters' and the recent `Brick' really understood the concept and delivered brilliantly.  `The Usually Suspects' doesn't quite get it to the point where whole sequences come off as awkward as apposed to genuine.

So a lot has been made about the `twist' that comes at the end of this film.  Some absolutely love it and stake their everlasting devotion to this film on the last few moments alone.  Others absolutely loathe it and feel that it killed the entire experience up till that point.  I'm personally torn because the `twist' comes in two parts really, and one part I find to be genius, the other I find to be a serious cop out; an easy route to take.

I'm going to yell SPOILER right here so that I can't get yelled at for this and if you have not seen this movie you can stop reading right here.

Having the revelation come about that the entire film up till the last few moments was a complete faade, an exaggerated fabrication of actual events, was genius.  Having the audience come to know that nothing they witnessed was actual and leaving them still scratching their heads, as was Kujan, wondering what `really' happened was just awesome in my opinion.  Having Verbal wind up being Soze was not.  I actually hate that aspect of the film.  It just feels so washed up to me, like they ran out of originality.  I guessed that Verbal was Soze about half way into the film, the moment Soze's name first came up and I was praying that the `twist' would prove me wrong.  Sadly, it didn't.  So I merely like the ending as apposed to hating or loving it.  I would probably still have nominated the screenplay since it was, for the most part, really well done, but I wouldn't have given it the Oscar.

In the end I see `The Usual Suspects' as a decent thriller that entertains as best it can.  Some mediocre acting and one devastating plot blow brings the film down for me, but I can't say that it is a complete waste of time.  It ends up earning a high C, just barely under a low B.  It is good but it is missing a few key elements to reach greatness.",1218758400,5,4778,4.4132420091324205
728231,4,6303908306,"The final climactic moment in The Usual Suspects is the vehicle by which this movie is mostly either worshipped or despised bitterly. Depending on how you see it, we either feel cheated about such a bizarre, seemingly impossible ending, or amazed at the curve ball thrown at us, under our noses the entire time. We may even wonder if this ending is proper etiquette, or ""fair game, for a suspense to employ. Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.

As odd as it may sound, I don't think that you can judge this movie on acting alone. Sure, Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job as Verbal Kint, who is interrogated by Detective Kujan. And Gabriel Byrnne does a commendable performance as Keating, a corrupt cop supposedly trying to steer right, but who gets back into the mix. Some of the performances aren't fantastic, but this is one time where I don't think they have to be. The method of getting to the story's climax is what ""makes"" this suspense fantastic. With the use of going back in forth in time, from the present in the detective's office where Kint is telling his story, to the past, where we not only learn about the five thugs who decide to the take the big job for Keyser Soze, to learning about each one of the five. There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as ""aha"" moments. You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this; a creative job of making this work, which usually doesn't work in movies, or ends up sloppy.

In many respects, the mystery surrounding Keyser Soze is what makes this puzzle a little more than the average mystery. As you watch the film, it is actually this character, real or fake, that derives much of the motivation for actions of the thieves, such as their decision to take the big job on the boat. Soze is one of the worst villains of the film, and yet, much of the film you are trying to figure out if the infamous killer is more man or more myth. The mystery surrounding this diabolical character's whereabouts, and his association with evil, seems to give the film's final moments even more significance and tenseness.

Smart writing carries this film, albeit with a superfluity of profanity spewed about. Its plot is its main strength, and this is the kind of film you can watch again and pick up on things you missed before. Watch this film remembering to take note of all that is seen, and remembering that sometimes things aren't always what they seem.",1216598400,,2484,4.527839643652562
728232,5,6303908306,"It is not a recent film, indeed. The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a boogeyman under the  bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this boogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, dubitative, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.

728269,3,6303908306,"Great suspense but unconvincing twist !

****Spoiler alert*****
I was bit surprised reading lot of positive reviews after seeing the movie. Well the plot is described in many reviews already. It is story of 5 gang men criminals who agree to blow up a ship where cocaine transaction worth 91 million takes place. The gang men do this disheartedly due to threat of someone called 'Keyser' who knows all their criminal history essentially blackmailing them. After the operation, there are only one survivor (Kevin spacey) who is given immunity after the incident.
The police interrogates him about the blowup to get possible clue of the actual assassin 'Keyser Soze'. Who is this Keyser soze ? Most of the movie is flashback narration of Kevin spacey to help police find out the killer. I won't spoil the the plot further !
The suspense is no doubt thrilling but somehow the story building is unconvincing. I felt more manipulated at when suspense unfolds. Why ? There are so many scenes earlier in the movie which don't make sense at all. Yet due to buildup in the beginning, we try to focus on each scene like investigators only to find that pieces don't fit. It is as if the director played a trick on us and this makes suspense uncompelling.
(Moreover flashback storytelling, I was confused about the sequence of scenes in the movie). We wear investigator cap to analyze the plot and we realize most of it is useless. Also, the details leading to revelation of plot suspense is not convincing. No clues revealed at the end have relavance to the earlier plot. It is as if the director played trick by pulling the rug without any clue.
  My comments are probably influenced due to comparision with Sixth sense movie. The movie is probably inspiration to 'twist ending' thrillers like 'Sixth sense' movie. In Sixth sense, the dead man doesn't know he is dead and yet there is scene when suffering boy says 'I see dead people and they don't know they are dead' to the dead man itself. After the suspense, we are compelled to look back the entire plot and it is still convincing. We see many other dead people talking to the boy in many scenes. This makes sixth sense is so bold in storytelling that at the end we don't feel tricked or manipulated (although trick is played on us by Night).
Entire movie seems convincing and we rewind the movie to see again.
This is where 'Usual suspects' fails ! We rather feel manipulated by director. I would prefer to be watch a drama rather than a manipulative thriller.
The movie however has excellent screenplay. The music score by John Ottman is hypnotic and evokes emotion to the plot. Kevin spacey is powerful actor and he does great job as crippled passive criminal !",1188691200,,2708,4.672955974842767
728300,5,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" twists, turns, charms, and delivers a wallop of a twist, making this thriller one of the more memorable films of the 1990s.  Kevin Spacey plays the club-footed, meek con man Verbal who is under intense interrogation by the police for his role in an armed robbery.  As he cracks and begins to reveal the intricacies of what happened, the viewer plunges into the story along with Verbal's interrogators.  What seemed simple to the police is at first is anything but, especially when the mysterious and dangerous Keyser Soze becomes involved.

This stylish, postmodern film is driven by two conflicts:  the complex crime devised by the band of ""usual suspects ((Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Gabriel Byne, and Spacey) and the central mystery: Who is Keyser Soze, and why does everyone fear him?  The acting is superb, with Spacey and Byrne turning in especially fine performances.  Its haunting soundtrack evokes a cinematic atmosphere so particular to the film that even a few bars of it can evoke the entire movie.

The DVD is well worth purchasing, as it is the kind of film that one can watch over and over, even after learning of the twist.  The enjoyment of knowing the end does not diminish the whole, as subsequent viewings reveal intriguing subtleties and details that were likely to have been missed the first, or even the second, time around.  Highly recommended.

728305,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects is a film noir movie set in modern times. I adore film noir movies, and one of the first things you learn about this genre is NOT TO READ PLOT DETAILS! I will not give away ANY plot details in this review. If you get even the inkling of what happens in the plot, it tends to make you ""wait"" through the entire movie for that particular twist or turn to happen. It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds. That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching. The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled. In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way. Where most movies can get boring after a viewing or two, I've seen many of my film noir movies quite a large number of times.

The beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved - Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, and many others. Every one of these actors does a fantastic job. There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story. Again, I don't want to give away the details of the plot for you to ""watch for"". Once you've seen the movie, there will undoubtedly be moments that stand out for you. But don't stop there. Go back and watch it again. Suddenly you'll realize the meaning in the way someone looks at someone else - the way someone reacts to a specific line of dialogue. It's simply brilliant.

There are a number of heavily accented characters here which means the first time through you might not really realize what someone is saying. They do that on purpose.

728307,5,6303908306,"This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades! Bryan Singer, working on a very low budget, delivers a high quality film that stands just as strong now as it did upon release in 1995. The story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film. Kevin Spacey, Gabrielle Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Torres, and Chaz Palminteri turn in tour-de-force performances in this stunning crime-caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the ""X-Men"" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and ""Apt Pupil"", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella. The story is so twisted and convoluted that at film's end, you're still left wondering WHO IS Keyser Soze?. Even when you think you have a grasp on things and have everything figured out (even after the film's final twist), it still leaves the viewer reeling, not really sure if they have figured out just WHO the real Keyse Soze is or not, if there even is a Keyser Soze.
And, that is how great film noir is supposed to work. Think ""The Big Sleep"", a story so twisted that allegedly the screenwriter didn't even know who 'done it' at the film's end. This is definetly a five star film (I would rate it higher if Amazon allowed such, giving it a ten or higher) that any film buff should add to their collection. I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece. Comparable in some ways to John Carpenter's ""In The Mouth of Madness' in that it spirals and twists into an ending that will leave you utterly breathless.
This is a film that will still be talked about in another ten years from now. Thank you.",1174348800,4,1787,4.501538461538462

728309,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects is 1995's fantastic mystery/thriller directed by Brian Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.  It stars Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollack as Todd Hockney, and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, five ex-cons pulled together for a line up for a NY York truck hijacking investigation.  The film won two Oscars, one for McQuarrie's original screenplay and one for Spacey's brilliant performance as a supporting actor in the role of Verbal Kint.

The movie starts at the end with Dean Keaton being shot on a boat in San Pedro, CA, by a mysterious character named Keysor Sose, and from there skips back and forth between the past and present as the police investigate the fire and mayhem that occurred on the boat resulting in the loss of 27 lives.  The only survivors are a badly burned and comatose Hungarian sailor and the crippled Verbal Kint, who has gotten immunity for his testimony in what happened between the line-up and the boat disaster in California six weeks later.

Without ruining the plot, let me just say we are introduced to the idea of Keyser Sose as some sort of mystical uber-criminal who had manipulated the gang from the very beginning to end up dead on the boat in California.  The end of the film is one of the most stunning endings in the history of Hollywood, and there are to this day, huge arguments about it.  I'm not going to spoil it here with my conjectures, you'll just have to watch the movie.

The cinematography was really nothing to write home about, pretty standard stuff for the most part.  The score was unobtrusive.  The story is what drives this film and makes it special.  And the actors were well chosen to run with the story.  The five guys that play the ex-cons do a fantastic job.  Also I really enjoyed Chazz Palminteri's portrayal of US Customs agent Dave Kujan, and Pete Postlewaite's portrayal of Keyser Sose's lawyer Kobayashi.  The acting in this movie was truly first rate.

Although the gang starts out avoiding violence, the film does become very violent.  It's rated R for a reason.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the level of violence in the movie.  But even so, it's one of the best mystery/thrillers I've ever seen.  The ending just can't be adequately described in words.",1170892800,2,2335,4.749379652605459

728356,4,6303908306,"The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in ""Throw Mama from the Train.""  But this is not a comedy.  It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either.  It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.

Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody.  The title is the tip off.

""Round up the usual suspects"" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know.  Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says ""round up the usual suspects"" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order.  It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.

While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but.  The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types.  The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint.  These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film.  In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley).  Consider these similarities:

In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an ""at your throat"" style.  In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane.  In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs.  These guys are not your run of the mill actors.  They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies.  They know how to look and act authentic.

But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue.  In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different.  In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play.  Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody ""Mister"" like an English butler.  And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.""

Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak.  And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois.  That will help to unravel the plot.  The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.

Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics.  But it's a little better than that.  And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem.  While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience.  Personally I thought the movie was a laugh.  I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it.  But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it.  Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology.  They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f-you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world.  And there's some truth to it.

Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified.  He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else.  I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.

Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre.  A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint.  You might want to write one yourself.",1170288000,6,5690,4.869022869022869
728357,5,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" belongs in a league with films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Out of Sight."" Not just because all three films juggle with time, but because they're all smartly written, well acted crime capers that are usually overlooked as being ""great films"" (with the exception of ""Pulp Fiction""). ""The Usual Suspects"" blends everything that makes a good crime film. It's well written, has some twists, is well acted, funny, and is rough around the edges. The Usual Suspects are McNamus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey); The five men are brought together when they're called in for a lineup, after a truck is hijacked. Pretty soon, the men are plotting jobs together. This all takes place in a flashback, because the film begins with the death of Keaton. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a cop, wants to get to the bottom of what happened and wants to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Keaton is dead. To find out this information, he interviews Verbal Kint, a gimp, who has nothing to lose in revealing information sense he has just been granted immunity by the D.A.'s office. This all leads to the brilliant climax that reveals what exactly a dying Hungarian man meant by the name ""Keyser Soze."" Spacey won his first Oscar for his role as Verbal Kint and he deserved it. For a man who never fails to turn in a winning performance, this is one of his best. The film also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, better known as the director of the first two ""X-Men"" movies and ""Superman Returns."" He's a director that doesn't get a lot of respect from critics or audiences (usually because he's dealing with beloved comic book characters), but with this film he proves that he is a talented director. The movie's fast-paced and very entertaining and when I said it was funny, I don't mean ""ha-ha"" funny...I mean very funny. The lineup scene is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. All the performances are good; Baldwin and Del Toro steal the show with their performances though. If you liked any of the movies I mentioned above or just enjoy smart crime films; you should check this film out.

But each minute brings the viewer deeper and deeper into a world in which things are not as they seem. The plot tentacles from the low-life antics of a group of five LA criminals into a global network of criminal enterprise and motivations that is difficult to imagine.

The tale is told mostly from the vantage point of 'Verbal' Kint, a small time criminal who is being interrogated by the police. Kint retells a story that starts when he was unexpectedly included in a lineup that includes the other four - the ""usual suspects"" of the title. There is a police shakedown going on, the unraveling of which becomes the central story line of the entire film.

728363,3,6303908306,"Knowing that I was behind the times I decided to catch up with ""The Usual Suspects,"" the critically acclaimed, Oscar winning film from 1995 that launched Bryan Singer's directorial career. I found it to be decent, but not worth the hype. The intricate plot involves a group of criminals who come together to pull off some kind of job on a boat. We watch, after the fact, as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his version of the story to the detective. What at first appears to be a mind boggling heist turns out to be just that. Writer Christopher McQuarrie seems to want to keep his audience at a distance as the script has a very cold veneer. No characters are given any warmth and there is nothing even resembling a sense of humor. It weighs down the entire film and we are stuck taking this elaborate punking as though it were high art. The script thinks very highly of itself. But with an Oscar on its side who am I to argue?

The film would probably be best enjoyed by those who like nice, intriguing capers, but it is not my cup of tea. All the trappings of an overly complicated plot are here, only it provides no real pay off in the end. Well there is a pay off that is explained in the shocking twist ending, but it is so forced that you will be forgiven for feeling played. There are no hints and no warning signs so that when the rug does get pulled out for under you the only thing that it results in is a sore rear end. If we wanted to we could look at this film and say that it serves as a celebration of storytelling, but if that is what it wanted to be then it should have tried harder at telling its own story.  And it is not just the lack of playfulness that bugged me (though for the record I'll take ""Ocean's 11"" over this any day), but also my inability to be drawn into these characters in this situation. I'm certainly not going to blame the actors, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are especially on target. No, something was missing, and my instincts tell me that it was humanity.

It is interesting that this is what started Singer's career, a career devoted pretty much to men who fly. Take the character Keyser Soze for instance. Here is a man who would fit right in on one of Marvel's pages. He's shadowy and stalks through the night striking terror in the hearts of many. Of course the myth is bigger than the man, but the build up is done quite well. As is a lot of this film, and I really have no intentions of dumping on it. The pacing is smooth in that it keeps everything going but never threatens whiplash. And for all my qualms with the story I was interested to see how it turned out. What story was true? What was on the boat? What were the usual suspects actually doing there? And so it goes and that is the fun to be had. All caper movies have a twist ending, and as I mentioned earlier so does this one. I was just hoping that it would have been a tiny bit more creative than the whole, ""Let's take the least likely ending possible and make that our ending"" bit.

He's kind of coasting on that  in this film which is only sort of rewatchable for the last half hour of the film and even then he doesn't really punch it - he sort of takes his hands off the steering wheel and lets the film coast to its conclusion.

Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.

The story is told in flashback by ""Verbal"" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze.

Bryan Singer is just such a director, in recent years he's become well known among comic book fans as one of the best directors to bring their favorite heroes to life in a long time, this is because of his films ""X-Men"", ""X2:  X-Men United"" and the recent release ""Superman Returns"".  Before Singer became known as the man that rejuvenated the comic book movie genre, he directed an incredibly taut, thriller with so many twists and turns that it still leaves audiences guessing to this day.  Of course, the movie I'm talking about is ""The Usual Suspects"" starring Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Stephen Baldwin.

""The Usual Suspects"" is about a band of small-time criminals who are gathered together one night for a police line-up and while in holding conspire together to pull off a one-time job that requires 5 men to make it a success.  Led by Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and brilliantly planned by Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey) this band of criminals pulls off the job without a hitch, and brings down a ring of corrupt cops in the process.  After the job is finished, Keaton tries to walk away from his life of crime, but the allure of even bigger jobs brings him back in.  Just when things were looking good for this band of criminals a man representing the crime lord Keyser Soze, a crime lord whom many believe to be nothing more than a myth amongst criminals, contacts them.  Keyser wants these criminals to pull off a job for him as payback for crimes they committed in their past, crimes that just so happened to interfere with plans Soze had in place for his own gains.  Now, this band of criminals must decide whether to pay off their debt to Keyser Soze, or refuse him and live out the rest of their lives on the run from death at Keyser Soze's hands.

Boasting an incredibly talented cast of actors, a twisted storyline that will leave you scratching your head as you struggle to understand everything you've just seen, and an excellent first-time director who shocked Hollywood with this impressive thrill ride.  ""The Usual Suspects"" is most definitely one of those rare Hollywood gems that when it comes along you can't help but pay attention.  Many people have said that this is one movie that once you've seen it, you really can't watch it again to just enjoy it because all of the surprise is gone.  I happen to disagree with these people, the fun in watching this movie during repeat viewings is not the shocking ending, it's trying to piece everything together and catching all of the clues that you miss the first time around.

Though the movie sometimes moves slow, though not very often, and these times serve as a nice breather from the mental games being played out in the film, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable movie that is way more than simple eye candy, but will provoke you to think about what you're watching.

Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.

The story is told in flashback by ""Verbal"" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As ""Verbal"" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.

Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance.

728506,5,6303908306,"This movie showcases a pretty solid pool of talent. Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri and especially Kevin Spacey. Spacey truly rises above the crowd in this movie. His performance is convincing (which it has to be for the movie to ""work"") and stirring.

This is an interesting story made up largely of mind games and betrayal. Each character has his own quirks and his own way of dealing with the situation they find themselves mixed up in. Baldwin and Del Toro's characters (who are partners in crime) are reckless, ""balls-to-the-wall"" criminals who like to go in with guns blazing. Gabriel Byrne's character is an ex-cop, so he is calculated and disciplined. Kevin Pollack's character is a Bad@ss who knows and executes his business well - while Kevin Spacey's character comes off as being intelligent, yet somewhat naive...

It is fascinating to watch it all unfold with Verbal Kint's (Kevin Spacey) retelling of the tale in Kujan's office at the precinct. Detective Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. The scenes shared by Spacey and Palminteri in that office are among the best moments in the film. These two actors seem to push each other and it really plays well on-screen.

Then, of course, the famous ending. Not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but this is a twist ending that you probably won't see coming until very late in the movie. It's not your usual, corny cop-out twist ending. This is well written and well done. Highly recommended.

That did not reduce my love for this movie at all.  The beauty comes from the subtle way Verbal manipulates his way through tough situations.  Most of the movie's finer touches, like the way Verbal smokes his cigarette in the American style while in the police station and European style when he is alone do not become obvious until you know the truth.

Rarely have I come across a film that immerses you in another world so completely I get the same feeling from this film that I do from Casablanca.",1147996800,3,759,4.206896551724138

Those of us that saw ""The Usual Suspects"" knew he would go on to make other great movies. Why he wasn't awarded best actor for this is beyond me. This was not a huge hit because of the violence, but nonetheless it is an exceptional movie. When a group of criminals is hired for a heist by an unknown leader, the mystery begins. A methodical plan for their crime and the successful results is expected, what happens to them afterwards is far different than any other crime movie and what makes it unique and excellent. Their unknown leader has a history that intertwines with the whole story and unfolds in a way that will soften even those that like the hardest movies. A twistng plot and almost funny secrets that only we the audience are let in on make it very unusual.  Fans of movies like ""Snatch"" and ""Formula 51"" should enjoy it the most. Any fan of Kevin Spacey should not miss this stellar performance, bloody or not. All the support cast is a powerhouse of talent and could not have been cast better.

I thought it should have gone to Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but the REAL film that should have won wasn't even nominated; Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, which was nominated for only two Academy Awards (best supporting actor and best original screenplay), which it both won.  Here we have a fast paced, confusing ""hall-of-mirrors"" crime-noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw-dropping.  This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.

The film starts off with what looks like five random criminals being brought in because of a bogus truck robbery.  The five men then plan to get back at the cops by uncovering a corrupt service the police were providing to certain high-paying criminals.  These five ""usual suspects"" grow closer to one another, coming together to pull off another job in L.A. which is where things start to get sticky.  They end up getting involved with a sinister crime lord that no one seems to have ever seen or met, named Keyser Soze.  Is Keyser real or is he just a figment of someone's imagination?  The more the jig-saw puzzle pieces seem to be coming together, the more the whole puzzle starts to change and fall apart.

You'll think you're on top of it all, but eventually the rug will be pulled out from beneath your feet.  The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had.  My hats off to director Bryan Singer (who later went on to bigger fame with 2000's X-Men) and writer Christopher McQuarrie for keeping all of this not only surprising, but fun, and exciting, without ever becoming too complicated or too confusing.  But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.

If you haven't already seen The Usual Suspects by now I highly recommend you go out and buy the special edition DVD right now, don't think about renting it, you'll just end up buying it later any way.  It's a complicated, well crafted and nearly flawlessly written thriller that's exciting and puzzling to watch the first time, and fun to watch again and again.  This is one of my top ten favorite films of the nineties, and one of my all-time personal favorites as well.",1145232000,4,2728,4.687631027253669
728511,5,6303908306,"Sometimes what happens with a film is that one thing tends to define it without acknowledgeing the rest of it. Many people remember Usual Suspects but most of them will usually just go ""yeah that ending rocked!"" without saying anything about the rest of them movie. Well before the X-Men and upcoming Superman, Bryan Singer made this film, a film that is better than that one little scene at the end by itself.

Verbal Kint is telling a story about how a boat got attacked and near 30 people were dead. In his story we meet 5 criminals who are called in about a robbery. There in lock up they meet, and decide to team up and take on some jobs. Verbal, McManus, Finster, Keaton and Hockney do some small jobs until a lawyer comes up to them and mentions a difficult job and the one wanting it done is Keyzer Soze, a legendary killer if there ever was one. So the question is who is it and does he even exist.

Usual Suspects was one of those kind of slow burner films where it didn't make much money but it did garner 2 Oscars, one for Kevin Spacey and one for Screenplay. Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films. Most of that was probably due to word of mouth about the twist ending which is as shocking as it is familiar so it's actually been parodied a number of times, including Scary Movie and even Dr Doolittle.

What makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story. Extra attention needs to be paid and in many scenes required repeated viewing to make sense of it. While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context. It's also very fascinating to watch the film; even though the film might have a leisurely pace, it never gets boring or makes you getting antsy.

Currently #16 on IMDB's list, it's one of those films where people will outright hate it because they didn't get it or praise it for its complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.",1142208000,5,2035,4.333333333333333

The acting is as good as it gets. Dealing with criminals on a regular basis as I do (as a lawyer, not as one of them), I can assure you that the characters in this movie speak  just like the real thing.
Those viewers who claim that the ending made them feel as if they  had been cheated have no serendipity.  What the ending actually does is provide endless hours of additional enjoyment as you retrace the movie's steps and ultimately realize that, yes, it all made perfect sense;  you just had no idea until you went back and put it all together.
As pointed out by other reviewers, this film contains a wealth of memorable lines.  One of my favorites is when the cops tell  Todd Hockney that they have placed him in Queens on the date of a recent hijacking  committed there.  Hockney's response:
""Really?  I live in Queens... What? Did you have a team of monkeys working around the clock to figure that out?""

728580,5,6303908306,"Bryan Singer was a young director during the filming of The Usual Suspects, and he was working with some of the biggest egos and some of the most talented dramatic and character actors of the day.

And then there's the controversy with Benicio Del Toro's interpretation of Fred Fenster, which nearly leads to a rebellion by the rest of the cast.

As for the film, almost everything has been said.  This is Pulp Fiction taken to the meta-fictional level; it's aware of its own structure.  Somehow, the film gets away with telling more often than showing the audience the story.  Since information and misinformation are both mixed and hidden in the film, the viewer experiences the rare treat of actual surprise at the film's conclusion.

Running Time:  106 minutes

Rated R for violence and a substantial amount of strong language.

""The Usual Suspects"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece of cinematic intrigue and suspense. At various points throughout its runtime, it is almost disarmingly comic, action-packed and insightful, yet at any given point when the film seems to be conforming to the clichs of its genre, the director is merely toying with the viewer and laying the foundations for one of cinema's most memorable climaxes.  ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist."" So says Kevin Spacey's Verbal Kint to his interrogator Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a US Customs Officer investigating the quayside slaughter of dozens of Argentinian sailors in what looks like the bloody aftermath of a major drugs deal. Mysteriously, Kint has been granted immunity in exchange for evidence, but the story he weaves in Kujan's office just doesn't seem to add up. Just how reliable is Kint's take on events leading up to the massacre, the genesis of which occurred some six weeks earlier when five ex-cons were bizarrely rounded up for an identity parade at a New York police station? Kint, one of the five, and, hampered by physical deformities, definitely the sickliest, appears to be the only survivor. He also appears to be the only witness to the death of the alleged ringleader of the group, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a notoriously corrupt ex-cop. But Kujan has a hard time believing that Keaton is really dead. He knows his form, and had not for one moment bought Keaton's recent line that his criminal days were behind him. Besides, Kint's evasive, slithering persona does not inspire confidence that what he's telling approximates to anything like the truth.  Looming over everything; however, is the unseen presence of Keyser Soze, a near-mythical Turkish crime-lord who embodies the elusive cunning of the devil to whom Kint alludes. Soze appears to be pulling all the strings, yet it's by no means clear that he's not simply a figment of the paranoid imagination of a collective criminal mind.

Spacey and Byrne, a study in contrasts both physical and temperamental, bring actorly gravitas to Bryan Singer's stylish and eloquent crime film. Spacey (who won Best Supporting Actor for the role) seems to shrink within himself as Kint, carrying his wounded, twisted body with the caution of a dog who's expecting a kicking; yet his ever watchful presence betrays a canny awareness that suggests he's not necessarily the weak link he may at first sight appear. Byrne, physically imposing and craggy-featured, is evidently a far more dangerous proposition than Spacey, yet the existential angst that grips him is characterized by a troubled conscience that makes him easily the most complex of the group. Director Bryan Singer and his screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie will be forever thankful for the inspiration that conjured Keyser Soze, for without him ""The Usual Suspects"" would simply be a routine, if gripping thriller, if it existed in any form at all. With him, Singer and McQuarrie have crafted something of a genre classic, complete with a breathtaking climactic twist that's right up there with ""The Crying Game"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" in the gobsmacking movie surprise stakes.  One of the better, most intelligent films of the middle of the decade.",1137369600,2,3562,5.177391304347826

Nowdays everyone talks about how Hollywood unlearned to make movies for smart audience, that all it does now are some stupid, comics-like, PG-13 flicks. I read some review lately and author was saying something like this: ""C'mon Hollywood, wake up, people are not that brainless"". So here's the answer I think - ""The Usual Suspects"" - really clever and shrewd film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown. Later he released ""Apt Pupil"" - also smart movie, and then... ""X-Men"", ""X2"", now he's filming ""Superman returns"" - well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema... But it's not the point here. As I said ""The Usual Suspects"" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now. Screenplay is awesome (and it deserved its Oscar), directing is beyond praise, acting Ensemble is like no other: Spacy (Academy Award too), Byrne, Baldwin, Palminteri, Del Toro, Pollak, Hedaya...

The movie opens with Gabriel Bryn's character getting shot, and the boat he's on gets set to fire. But then, we go back in time with these 5 criminals played by Gabriel Bryne, Stephen Baldwin, the comic but very hard to understand Benicio Del Torro, the marvelous Kevin Pollack, and of course Kevin Spacey whose character is crippled. These criminals are interviewed in prison but never get convicted. You watch them as they hold up cars and so forth. And then comes the scene where the messenger of someone who's either a myth or real called Keiser Soze who arrives. This man tells them that Mr. Soze wants them to hijack a boat and retrieve the cocaine on it. The criminals refuse but he informs them that Mr. Soze knows all of their criminal records. When they try to take this messenger out later, he says that Mr. Soze will kill their love ones if they refuse. You then find out that Soze (which you always don't know if he exists or not) is a madman who killed his own wife and children and killed many other men , women and children. The group of criminals have to now kill many bodyguards and cuban men to retrieve this cocaine. What happens next is amazing and very unpredictable. I won't give away anything else but, besides the bad words, you're in for a treat.",1119484800,2,1931,4.473087818696884
728694,1,6303908306,"Okay, so I heard about how great this movie is. ""It's funny, it's great, it's a classic,"" they all said. So I rented the movie and watched it. Now I just have three words: WTF???

I didn't get this movie. Was it supposed to be fun? Exciting? Thrilling? A mystery? What is it? At the end, I just didn't care.

Let's start with the characters. They are not very likeable at all to me. None of them are. They just like to cuss and yell all the time. Wow. I am amazed by the acting ability. The characters are just plain not very likeable, so when they all die I can't say I really care.

The story was dumb. Or, let me rephrase that. It's not that the story was dumb. The story was very complex. It's just that, who cares? A bunch of guys who we don't like get involved in some deal with some other guy who we don't like, and one survivor who we don't like gets interrogated by a ""tough"" cop who we don't like. Only at the end do we find out that the one ending that we thought we understood but didn't like is replaced by another ending a bit more convoluted but no more likeable. So what's to like?

The movie repeatedly makes a big deal about the lack of drugs on the boat. It has to make the point over and over, like it is something really vital for the audience to know. ""Ohmygosh there is no coke!"" or ""Golly gee, it wasn't a drug deal!"". Okay, scriptwriter. We get it already! And now that we know, who cares?

So the ""Big Mystery"" was that it was a hit rather than a drug deal. Wow. Really. Amazing. And we are supposed to care for WHAT reason?

And Humor? What humor? I've seen several people talk about how hilarious this movie is. When did that happen? I think I was awake the whole movie, and I didn't even take any bathroom breaks. This was supposed to be FUNNY? Where? When? How?

And what about the show's tagline? ""Who is Kieser Soze?"" How about this response: ""Who cares?"" I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in who Kieser Soze was the entire movie, and it wasn't until the movie was over that I finally realized that apparently I was supposed to have been concerned about this. I was supposed to have been thinking about who might be Kieser Soze the entire movie. Only I didn't. I guess the writing was just too sophisticated for a dense guy like me.

So it is a mystery then? Who is Kieser Soze? Okay, so let it be a mystery. Except, this movie ruins that for an audience too. Instead of letting there be any mystery, they rush at the end to explain the entire movie to you and let you know EXACTLY who the guy is. What mystery? What is there to discuss any further about this movie? And why would anybody ever want to watch it again?

This was a waste of time and waste of money. I can't believe this has an Amazon rating of 4-1/2 stars, for crying out loud! What are you people smoking???

If anybody wants to see a GOOD crime movie, with characters we can actually feel for and care about plus a complex and intriguing story, try watching THE GODFATHER again. Now THAT is what good moviemaking is all about.

So are you pissed off yet? Leave me a ""No, this review was not helpful"" rating if you want to folks, but I just didn't get this movie. Highly Unrecommended.",1118016000,41,3189,4.220032840722496

Kevin Spacey stars in this deceptive film about five high-ranking conmen and their last major job before they are all killed in an attempt to blow up a boat with an inordinate amount of cocaine. The payoff: $91 million. To the dismay (or demise i should say) of the five ""usual suspects"" the objective doesn't seem to be there. But somehow the money is.

Anyone who likes this kind of convoluted suspense will definitely appreciate this flick.

The DVD I watched was the original disc (not the fancy new one), and since this movie came out ten years ago the audio and visual quality were pretty bad. But since this is an old-fashioned movie in the sense that it wants to entertain by telling a real story with interesting characters instead of putting all its hopes in flashy special effects, the bad quality of the technology didn't actually matter. The plot is rather confusing, involving the complex lives of five career criminals, strange underground crime deals, and an unseen, mysterious crime boss hovering over all the action. In one sense the film is a traditional whodunit, but as the viewer gets deeper into the story, you not only begin to wonder who did it but what it actually was that he did, since the main story is being told by one of the criminals, and you are never quite sure if he is telling the truth. The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into the story, as this is one of the smartest crime films I've ever seen, and it contains surprises for the viewer on a Shyamalanesque scale. It's a joy to watch filmmaking of this caliber, and now I know why the X-Men series has done so well in Singer's capable hands.",1110758400,,1321,4.485477178423237
728769,3,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a fascinating, convoluted, frustrating, remarkable, confusing mess of a movie.  Its incredibly complex plot is fascinating; the plot is convoluted, frequently going in a number of directions at the same time, leaving holes in the plot and gaps that are too often frustrating; is remarkable because its ending ties up the most troublesome of these; but is confusing because it leaves other questions unanswered.  Ultimately it's a case of buckshot cinema; it sprays all kinds of ideas, clues, red herrings, and misdirection, and doesn't play fair with the audience in that it drops clues and later pretends they didn't exist.  It cheats you.

Oh, not that it's boring.  Not in the least.  ""The Usual Suspects"" is equal parts film noir, Agatha Christie murder mystery, and ""Reservoir Dogs"" wannabe without the great dialogue.  The film won an Oscar for best screenplay and another for Kevin Spacey's ""supporting actor"" role.  Spacey's award was well deserved; the cheating screenplay wasn't.  Check out the physically impossible moments such as putting out a fire in the film's early moments and, later, blood spattering in the wrong direction in an elevator.  Another sin committed here is the showbiz idiocy of an actor firing a handgun while holding it sideways; ask anyone familiar with handgun marksmanship and he/she will tell you that's a sure way to miss your target nearly every time.  Stupid.  Finally, and worst of all, a key character at film's end whose name is revealed as being made up on the spot even though the writers, in the previous scene, show the character's name in court records from the previous day.  Wha?

Personally I don't like being lied to, and the screenplay goes beyond misdirection to out-and-out ripping you off.  Unfair.  Perhaps a more gullible (or less attentive) viewer won't notice.  It's telling that screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has only had one other screenplay produced in the 10 years since this film was made (2000's ""The Way Of the Gun"").

It's worth a look, though, partly because of how well and stylishly the finished production cheats on you.  Obviously it got away with it, for most people.  Also, continuing the obvious parallels to ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this film is far more stunning in terms of cinematography, obviously a higher budget film (I can hear McQuarrie and director Bryan Singer, who were high school buds, pitching this film to prospective producers:  ""It's an upscale 'Reservoir Dogs' with a bigger twist at the end,"" which is essentially what it is).  Also, the cast cannot be faulted, in spite of one actor who thinks he's Marlon Brando with a worse mushmouth than usual.  (Perhaps it's the character who thinks that.)  Any film with Spacey sharing extended screen time with Chazz Palmanteri is worth three stars for that alone, and Kevin Pollak & Gabriel Byrne are bonuses.  One question:  How did Stephen Baldwin sink from this to ""The Surreal Life""?

""The Usual Suspects,"" ultimately, is more frustrating than most films because of how good it could have been.  A little more attention to detail and a little less disingenuousness would have resulted in a far, far more satisfying finished product.  Another reviewer for Amazon asks if this is the perfect film, and the answer is, ""Far from it, but many of the elements are there.""  If you want to see the nearest thing to cinematic perfection, go back and watch ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Local Hero.""",1109548800,2,3449,5.0

It is one of those movies you enjoy more the second and third and fourth time around, always picking up things you missed before.

It has a great villain.  That is very important to a story.  There is no hero, which, come to think of it, is odd.  But the villain is nearly of the magnitude of Tolkein's character Sauron.

728776,5,6303908306,"The film centers around five different criminals in New York that are locked up together, based on a trumped up weapons charge. After their release, they decide to work together and get revenge, by commiting crimes. However, someone else is controlling the events that take place. The five men soon discover that they are connected to each other because they have all pulled jobs where they unknowingly ripped off a man going by the alias of Keiser Sose. The mysterious Keiser Sose is basically thought of as the Devil himself in the criminal underworld. The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose.

Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. If I had to create a list of my five favorite films, it would definately be on that list. When it comes to most mystery films, I can only usually watch them once. Once I know how the film will end, I can never make myself sit through them again because the suprise of what comes next is gone. The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end. In fact, the film only seems to get better after each time that I see it. The film unfolds brilliantly. It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U.S. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time. The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film, is how director Bryan Singer handles the character of Keiser Sose. The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing. You come to believe throughout the course of the movie, that Sose could literally be the Devil himself.

Another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen. The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors. Gabriel Byrne stars as Dan Keaton who is the leader of the group. Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality. On one hand, Keaton is chosen as the leader because of how cold, calculating, and evil he is overall. But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times. Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly. This film also marks the breakout role for actor Kevin Spacey with his portrayal of a crippled con artist named Verbal Kint. Spacey had to do the most work in the film without a doubt because he not only had to perform scenes in the events that unfold, but Verbal Kint is also the man that is forced to sit through the interigation where we learn about the events that unfold and how they went down. Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple. He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal. He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature. The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack.

This highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours. Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece. The DVD is worth the money alone just for the extras. Some of them include never before seen deleted scenes, audio commentaries by director Bryan Singer & writer Christopher McQuarrie, three featurettes, a gag reel , and much more.

It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well-made, entertainingly twisty little mystery. It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role---well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists---with the final twist being the most shocking of all. Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did---it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean. Now, whether it truly stands up upon repeated viewings is a more difficult question.

If he comes up for anything it'll be to get rid of me. After that... my guess is you'll never hear from him again."" Of course, he also says things like ""Back when I was in barbershop quartet in Skokie Illinois"" and ""Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee, right off the trees I mean.""

728920,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects, is, in my mind, one of the most fantastic pieces of film-making ever to grace our screens. That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening. Who knows, maybe this film has no superior.
A lot is made of the film's ending. Not for a moment am I going to let slip what exactly that is. I would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. While not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece ALL the way through, the ending will blow you away.
The cast is, in a word, flawless. Kevin Spacey has, as far as I am concerned, never been better. He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars. But he is not alone. Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.
By all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending EVER in a film made anywhere in the world. I mean that. Just who is Kasier Soseh?",1083542400,7,1233,4.460176991150442
728921,3,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" is perfectly watchable, but far from great. It probably didn't help that I watched this in 2004, well past all the breathless hoopla and the awards. It probably also doesn't help that I'm not a big Kevin Spacey fan-he is a bit histrionic for my taste. Gabrile Bryne was excellent in this movie though, as was Stephen Baldwin. The plot moves reasonably fast, but is ultimately unsatisfactory. Everyone's heard of the plot by  now:  5 random guys (the ""usual suspects') are brought in for questioning on a crime, then get together to plot a new crime. Only one-Spacey-survives at the end and tells his tale of a super bad guy who engineered all of it. The problem with the plot is that it has a lot of holes in it, isn't as clever as it purports to be, and ultimately fails to make sufficient sense. The thing with having a twist at the end is that the whole movie still needs to make perfect sense upon reviewing, which in my opinion, this movie failed to do! The motives of the characters (especially Soze) were far from clear---does a mastermind of that sort need these 2 bit criminals to help him along? How could he ensure that he wouldn't get caught up in it at the end? How does the Steve Baldwin character come up with the plot in the first place? How do the cops even get their hands on Soze if he's so good? Wasn't there a better, less elaborate way for him to off the witness?, etc. etc. There are just way too many questions...and the plot ultimately proves to be dull and contrived. Some of the scenes are just too self-important and not clever enough by half (much in the way that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is not clever enough, to use a recent analogy!). The only redeeming factors are an engaging cast and a quick (if rambling and somewhat pointless) plot. This isn't a bad movie but it doesn't live upto the hype. If you really want a well-crafted movie with a big surprise at the end, watch ""The Sixth Sense"". If you want a clever movie that makes you work to put everything together, watch ""Memento"".",1083283200,3,2032,4.43048128342246
728922,3,6303908306,"Perhaps I am being too critical, but I found this flick to be a bit predictable.  How often does Kevin Spacey play a weak, stupid little pawn in someone else's game?  He's too loved, too big of a name, and I quickly figured out that he must have some plan up his sleeve.  Wise-cracking, clever Spacey would never be cast in the kind of roll that this movie would have its viewers believe.  Not a bad watch for a bit of unchallenging entertainment, though.  But it wasn't entertaining enough to make me want to watch it again or even to recommend it to my friends.  No hard feelings, all right?",1083024000,2,593,4.345454545454546

Five Criminals Are Brought Together In A Police Line-Up...

Because he knows just as everyone else who has seen the film that you are letting yourself in for something special.
And, I guarantee you that the next time you go into your local video store and catch a glimpse of the now 'oh-so-famous' cover of the film out of the corner of your eye you will notice that whereas before the film camouflaged itself against all the other films, it now seems to shine just like a self-assured individual stands out from a crowd.

728924,5,6303908306,"This is the unique story of 5 criminals and an anonymous crime lord. This movie is a masterpiece with an amazing ironic climax.  A few may say the movie is wierd or complicated, but they just didn't understand the thing.  The Usual Suspects is not your usual film, and will probably need a second viewing in order to fill in the gaps in your mind as well as the questions that hit you time after time. This story is great because the plot does nothing but puzzle you for the entire duration of the movie, then in the last 2 minutes most of your questions are answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking ""what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again because there was something I didn't quite understand"". No matter how many times you watch it, you always seem to pickup something you didn't quite understand or catch the last time. The scenes don't get boring, the action doesn't just jump in at the opening scene, the films is filled with those catchy film dialogues that are nothing but great, and the climatic twist will leave most of you banging your heads with frustration because you had no idea what was coming to you. The well-chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction. This movie is ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and most importantly, cool. This film is a classic that we can compare all other movies to.",1082073600,7,1446,4.473484848484849

728926,5,6303908306,"Despite it's 1995 release, I only recently learned of this simply brilliant caper / mystery / thriller film masterpiece.  It is extremely demanding of its audience.
I rank it with the best classic mysteries, such as Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", Welles' ""The Third Man"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"", and similar films, ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The Big Sleep"", ""Farewell, My Lovely"", and ""Laura"".  It compares very favorably to the more recent mystery standouts  ""Chinatown"", ""The Two Jakes"", and ""L.A. Confidential"", in both storyline and production quality. Sets are excellent. Every actor is superb.
However, the film it rivals most closely, in my opinion, is David Mamet's utterly absorbing, and demanding, and brilliant 1987 masterpiece, starring Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, ""House of Games"".  It's surely no accident that con and scam artists play a major part in each!  These are, after all, psychological thrillers, or chessmatches!
I dare anyone to watch both films, back to back, in either order, and not be emotionally and intellectually exhausted.

728983,2,6303908306,"I used to love this movie.  The film's often mentioned final twist seems so devilishly clever the first time you see it.  Then you think about it for a while and you realize how this formulaic whodunit never gave you a chance.

The entire allure of mystery stories for the viewer is to of course try figure them out before the story itself reveals the truth.  As a writer, the trick is to present all the evidence to the viewer in a passing, seemingly inconsequential fashion usually out of order and with twists that throw him or her off and then tie everything up at the finish.  The tease is that everything or at least enough information is presented before you find out the truth.

This film does not do that.  Basically, this film lies to you for two hours and pretends to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end as if you had been standing in the same room in which the trick was performed.  Instead of clarifying, the final scene raises more questions than it answers assuming the only question you care about is the idenity of Soze.

As infuriating as this is, the characters are somewhat fun to watch.  All five usual suspects are characters that have appeared in dozens of streetwise mysteries before but their interaction with one another is appealing.  Del Toro has some great lines as Fenster, (""He'll flip ya, flip ya fo' real"" is a fav of mine) and most of the perforances are well done.  Spacey is of course great and this is my favorite role for Chazz P since A Bronx Tale.  Otherwise, this is a movie that revisits used themes like the internal conflict between good and evil and the mythology of criminal underworlds and since everything is a lie the questions your left with devalue the one truth revealed.",1073606400,11,1729,4.485623003194888
728984,5,6303908306,"Before the dime drops (or should I say the cup of coffee) at the end of the film, I felt that I had already seen a great movie. And then we find out the significance of the name of the manufacturer of bulletin boards. By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement. This is an extraordinary film. A film that asks the old question: How can we be sure about the truth of anything? Are things true because we simply believe the teller, who might be a consummate liar? Or do we believe the teller because he tells us what we want to hear?
I'm going to stop there because this is not an artsy, philosophical film. This is a suspenseful, action-packed, and strangely-funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive--it is not the THEME of the movie. And what a plot device! I can't say any more without giving the story away.
So I'll go on to the performances. Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff. But the other actors were overlooked, at least by the critics. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin all do a great job, but Benicio Del Toro's role as Fenster is nothing less than a tour de force! Pete Postlethwaite turns in his standard excellence. Rouding out the cast are the always surprising Dan Hedaya and Giancarlo Esposito--two actors that I think deserve better recognition than they've gotten so far.
Behind it all is an unbelieveably tight script and Bryan Singer's masterful direction. This is a must see movie for lovers of crime, action, mystery films, and a must see for anyone who enjoys the type of rare film that is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, which is something that is not usual for movies today.",1070841600,6,1765,4.5886075949367084
728985,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects is a very effective movie for several reasons.  One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.  However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending; it works regardless.  In fact, I don't think the ending is all that great, for reasons I will mention later.
The story centers around a supposed drug bust gone bad.  Roughly 90 million dollars worth of narcotics were on a ship and a group of notorious criminals were assembled to get the money.  The very beginning of the film shows that things got out of hand and the boat actually exploded, with practically all people in the vicinity being killed.
The criminals were chosen by a character named Keyser Sose (so-say) who is so renowned for his criminal actions that the mere mention of his name brings panic and fear.  We see a flashback of his cold blooded nature: when thieves took over his house and threatened his family, he walked in calmly, shot his family first, and then shot the bad guys.  The implication is that he will kill instantly and without remorse.  He is almost mythical, no one has ever seen him and lived to tell it, and some don't even believe in his existence.  All five criminals (played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Torro, and Stephen Baldwin) have done something to hurt Sose in the past, and so this is their chance to redeem themselves.  The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.
After the explosion, only Verbal (Spacey) is left.  He is brought in for questioning, given immunity for his information, and on his way out the door, answers a few more questions for Agent Kujay (Chazz Palminteri), where he talks about the whole situation.  We only see what happened through Verbal's eyes.  In this way, the movie is like the classic Rashomon or the more recent and much less effective Basic, where we see information through the eyes of one very closely involved.  How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.
The ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.  In that sense, it almost cheats a little, because it's easy to fool someone when you don't give them a chance to solve the riddle.  Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.",1069200000,2,2447,4.527272727272727

Benicio del Toro is extremely memorable as a mumbling thug, Gabriel Byrne is quiet and intense, Stephen Baldwin is a cannon ready to go off, Kevin Pollock is an egocentric criminal who only maintains alliances for his own selfish gains, and Kevin Spacey sparkles as a crippled confidence man.

He won the first of his 2 Oscars for ""The Usual Suspects,"" the second coming for ""American Beauty"" in 1999.  This film also won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

Even then, it must be seen at least once more to gain a sense of its multiple meanings and then again at least several more times to appreciate its complexity and ambiguity. The viewer's patience is abundantly rewarded with thought-provoking entertainment and yet, the question persists: ""What am I missing?"" Under Brian Singer's crisp direction, all of the cast's performances are first-rate. Kevin Spacey (as Roger Kint, aptly nicknamed ""Verbal"" because he says so much and yet....) received an Academy Award for his performance. Were an Academy Award also given for best ensemble, he and others in the cast would have received it.
At one point, Kint suggests that ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" That comment offers what I consider to be a useful perspective on the film because so much of what happens (or seems to happen) is unconvincing. I began to wonder, which (if any) of the characters can I trust? Was there really a mobster named Keyser Soze? If so, so what? With especially effective use of flashbacks in coordination with Kint's extended interrogation by NYPD detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Singer seems to be guiding us to one conclusion...only to have another occur, one which left me asking ""Has all this been a dream? Or is it a practical joke? What am I to believe?"" Recalling Kint's comment after I saw The Usual Suspects for the first time, I was almost convinced that Singer's ""greatest trick"" was that his film ""didn't exist."" Of course it does...and becomes more and less clear every time I see it. Hence this film's elusive but compelling appeal, one which I, at least, am unable to explain in a brief commentary such as this.",1064275200,,1830,4.8312101910828025
728991,5,6303908306,"Unlike most suspense thrillers,'Usual Suspects' remains interesting even after multiple viewings. Its charm is not dependent on suspense alone. Its true force comes from the acting by the main leads and the narrative technique followed by Bryan Singer. Just when one story thread appears to be in the danger of going limp, there emerges another much tauter. The screenplay is such a deviously contrived maze that almost every character appears to be lost at one point or another.
Some people complain about the contrived ending. But why ending alone? The whole plot is a contrivance. More mportant than the plausibility element, I think it's the entertainment angle that's really taken care of. And it's pretty cerebral at that.
One of the pleasures of this move is that it makes you care about some of the main characters. You wonder what kind of a life Verbal leads in private. Or what would Keaton be doing if he hadn't got hooked? Was there a real Keyser Soze?

729193,5,6303908306,"One of my favorite films of all times, The Usual Suspects is an exeptionally strong ensemble cast work. In particular Gabriel Byrne's cynical and beaten down reformed criminal gone bad role is played so ernestly that you forget you are watching a film. Kevin Spacey's Verbal Gint character is terrific to watch as well. Benicio del Toro steals scenes with his bizzare choice of character in an otherwise nothing role. Even Steven Baldwin turns in a good performance as does Kevin Pollack in a somewhat different role than he usually plays.
All the acting is terrific and more importantly, the script is nearly flawless as is the direction. The plot moves along in it's multi-threaded fashion while keeping viewers entertained and involved enough to pay attention.
The ending will either annoy or delight you depending on how you view films. I loved it and on second viewing the forshadowing of events are right in front of you like a good murder mystery although The Usual Suspects is much more than a mystery film or buddy flick or crime caper film while being a little bit of each.
It's great to see a film that isn't high budget and relies on acting and a good script to move the film along. Although embraced by hollywood this is as independent as you will find in it's easy tone and believable characters.
There is simply nothing worth complaining about. Get this DVD, it's additonal content is a lot of fun to watch and helps understanding The Usuual Suspects as more than a film but a project and labor of love that works on all fronts.",1045872000,3,1543,4.676470588235294

729292,5,6303908306,"What earns a film the characterisation ""classic""? First and foremost a great script. Check, then. The ""Usual Suspects"" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether.
  A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called ""Keyser Sose"", and the story being told in retrospect by ""Verbal"" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.
  As you try to make sense out of what ""verbal"" says (while the ""facts"" keep constantly changing and ""verbal"" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is ""who is Keyser Sose""? And, exactly because ""Keyser"" could be any of a number of ""suspects"", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.
  And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the ""Usual suspects"" or a true fan of cinema.
  But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of ""Verbal"" is sharply inspiring.
  But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.
  The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can ""exist"". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over ""Sose"" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is. The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's ""right hand"" the enigmatic ""Mr. Kobayashi"" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.
Mindblowing film. Puts the ""C"" into classic.",1039910400,4,2546,4.7482993197278915

729297,5,6303908306,"This is, without question, one of the best films of 1995, and one of the best mysteries ever. It feels sort of like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. You'll spend the whole movie wondering who's messing with whom, who the mysterious Keyser Sze is, and what he's after.
A group of mismatched criminals, played to perfection by the cast, are lumped together for a crime apparently none of them were guilty of. Irritated at having their time wasted, they decide to even the score by releaving a few less than honest cops of their less than honest merchandise. This sets into motion a chain of events that will lead them to Keyser's lawyer, Kobayashi. From there, well, I don't want to ruin it for you.
This film opened the same year as SEVEN, in which Kevin Spacey (then a relatively unknown character actor) played an uncredited role. This was a vehicle for Spacey, and he works it like a wind-up watch. (From here, he would go onto the equally great LA CONFIDENTIAL.) Gabriel Burns is his usual talented self, and Benicio Del Toro is hilarious as Fenster.
If you're looking for a good mystery that doesn't treat the audience like idiots, this one is for you. Told in a series of present and flashback story lines, you'll have to think it out a little. It's worth it, though, in the end to know Who Is Keyser Sze?",1035417600,5,1307,4.518987341772152

729390,4,6303908306,"A multi-layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, ""Usual Suspects"" puts together a great cast and a story-within-a-story plot.  The Suspects include Keaton (Byrne) a disgraced ex-cop; Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey), a club-footed petty criminal; Hockney (Pollack) the explosives expert; McManus (Baldwin) who's something of an explosive himself and Fenster (Del Toro).  I'm not sure what Fenster's role is, but given the hushed and marble-mouth tones that he speaks in, nobody else seems to know either.  The story is told in flashback by Verbal after the rest are either dead or presumed dead.  The film begins with the explosive destruction of a freighter in southern California.  Only one other man, the freighter's horrifically burnt passenger, survives.  He knows nothing of our heroes, instead ranting about ""Keyser Soze"".  Recognizing the name of an international criminal who murders almost on whim, and connecting him to the Suspects, a federal agent (Palmintierri) who's made a career of investigating Keaton, puts Verbal on the grill, forcing Spacey's character to recount how the boys came to know each other.  Gathered weeks earlier by the police as suspects or line-up fillers in the hijacking of a police truck carrying guns earmarked for destruction, the suspects (Verbal being one of the ""fillers"") are initially strangers, yet join together and form a plan.  Released when nobody gets pinned for the truck rap, the Suspects go into business - targeting for robbery various high-level smugglers who pay to keep the police at arms length.  Soon their rep brings them to the west coast, but we also learn that they had already come to the attention of Keyser Soze - by virtue of how their crimes have come at his expense.  Blackmailed by Soze through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Posthlethwaite, looking and sounding more Indo-Pak than Japanese), the suspects reluctantly follow his orders and shoot their way into a docked freighter loaded (says Kobayashi) with a fortune in cocaine.  By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze - less a man than a force of nature gone bad; a Hungarian criminal who killed his own family rather than let rivals hold them hostages against him; a mass killer who not only hunts down those who had tried to hold his family hostage, but their friends and families as well.  Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.
Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.  Sure, you'll probably figure out the big secret within the first few minutes (once a police sketch artist is brought in, the secret will practically leap out at you).  Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.  The ultimate trick isn't Keyser Soze secret identity but how the story gets you to root and care for a crew of wretched, murderous and greedy losers who'd be fodder in a more upstanding story.  The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.  I had an idea that it would be some buddy-buddy picture of good-guy criminals - a sort of ""Brinks Job"" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying.",1032393600,3,3162,4.911654135338346

Chilling words from one of the most chilling scenes in this brilliantly written, acted and directed film.  The Usual Suspects is the original Memento, as time is not a factor and the scenes are like a patchwork quilt, pitching you back and forth between what happened and what is happening.  Confusing, yes, but genius to write it as Christopher McQuarrie did.  He deserved the Oscar he received.  As did Kevin Spacey.
The Usual Suspects revolves primarily around Spacey, casting him as Verbal Kint, a gimped man with an odd, pigeon toed like walk.  The walk is brilliantly executed, as it causes the audience to feel sorrow, but at the same time have a deep-seated suspicion that something is going on, primarily because of his monotone voice and his occassional outburst that makes him seem to break from character.  Kint is the only survivor of a harsh firefight and a series of explosions that leave many dead...and one man teetering on the brink of death, repeating the words ""Keyser Soze"" over and over again.  Eventually, the detective heading the investigation (Chazz Palimentri in a flawlessly executed performance) gets the story (or lack thereof) out of Verbal about all the occurred before the fire in the night that left so many charred bodies in its wake.  It is a story involving drugs, deception and a lot of money.
By the end, everything comes together, but your brain is tied up in knots, as one question is hovering overhead...""How?""  The Usual Suspects is a chilling look into the consequences of greed and trust in a situation where no one deserves such a luxury.  It is a brilliantly written film with dynamic performances by Spacey, Palimentri, Kevin Pollak and Stephen Baldwin.

729504,4,6303908306,"Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.
Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.
The story is told in flashback by ""Verbal"" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As ""Verbal"" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.
Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance.

And the only thing they fear is Kaiser Soze.
Yeah right...
Why would anyone be afraid of a guy who killed his own family? Every-time his enemies turn up he kills someone he loves?! Who's gonna work for a moron like that!? The only thing to fear is that you might be related to him!...
All the rest is talk-talk, bang-bang, and not even a kiss-kiss. Light and witless fare at best.

729507,5,6303908306,"Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" is a breathtaking crime thriller that exceeded all expectations after its 1995 release and to me represents the zenith of filmmaking. Singer himself creates the story using complicated and beautiful shots and an uncompromising vision. This man knows what he wants. And this is to bring Christopher McQuarrie's script to life. The script itself is a magnificent twister that leaves all ends loose. It is quite simply sheer brilliance. Kevin Spacey's performance, though, is the key to the movie's success. If Kevin could not pull off the subtleties required of a character of such importance the movie would not have worked at all. His performance is simply amazing in its difficulty and aim. Great supporting roles by Gabriel Byrne and Benicio Del Toro (with one of the funniest movie accents of all time). And the ending literally left me with my mouth open. At the end of this movie, I was simply in awe. It had managed to capture me and fascinate me in a manner few others have.",1024790400,2,1017,4.850574712643678

729509,4,6303908306,"Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.
Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.
The story is told in flashback by ""Verbal"" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As ""Verbal"" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.
Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze?

729510,5,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" is such a phenomenal story, with a great ensemble cast - what could be better than owning it on DVD? Well I'll tell you - owning the special edition on DVD. The special features on here are probably equal to the length of the movie itself, and offer really great insight into the director, editor, and cast. Extensive interviews with the key players reveal inside information that is fascinating. The gag reel is hysterical, and the bit of Del Torro ""getting stuck on words"" as Fenster alone is worth the price of the entire disc. The deleted scenes aren't as interesting as I'd hoped - I think the crew did a great job selecting what got left out.
The plot is wonderful, involving a small crew of big- and small-time criminals and con-men who must work together to repay their individual debts to a mysterious man named Keyser Soze. Soze is a legend (some even say a myth,) whom many people believe to be the devil himself. He is ruthless, brutal, powerful and hugely successful. Pete Postlethewaite plays a wonderful attache for Mr. Soze, carrying off a bizarre combination of careful politeness edged by steely resolve. There aren't enough accolades for this whole cast, though - each actor does an incredible job of getting into his character's skin, and each man makes the viewer believe that he feels each and every little tic and itch his character would feel.
The first time I saw this film, I confess that I was had - I honestly didn't know how it would end until The Big Reveal. I suspect it'll keep most people guessing. Even then, after knowing how it ends, watching it over and over again is still enjoyable, simply because of the details and hints to the truth one picks up. Plus, the characters are so engaging, and the chemistry between all of them works so well, it's just a supremely enjoyable ride every time.

I don't understand why he hasn't had more films.

If you enjoy the film, you'll probably want to watch it again, and you'll be irked that you didn't have an opportunity to put all the pieces together yourself before knowing the ending.
So if you come across the middle of an airing of it on cable some night, and you want to catch a few minutes since you've heard so much about it (like I did), don't!  It would be better to just switch to another channel and rent the movie (or buy it) at another time, so you can sit down and start from the beginning.
Also, the film is doubly entertaining in that it's like one of those jackets that you can turn inside-out and wear either way.  You sit down and watch it and get hit with its raw impact - then you sit down again, and all the scenes have a totally different meaning the second time, which makes it - basically - two movies for the price of one.

The Usual Suspects is an twisting, turning thrill ride into the dark underworld of hardcore criminals. This movies characters are unparalleled. There is Keaton the mastermind of the operation. There is Fenster and Mcmanus who are longtime partners and top notch entry men. There is Todd Hockney who is the explosives expert. The most interesting and prominent character is Verbal Kint. He is the odd man out, he is a cripple so he dosen't really have a place in the crime world.
This story is told through Verbal's eyes as he tells the story of The Usual Suspects. These five men were not supposed to meet. They are an explosive group of hardcore criminals, who if the payoff is right will go into battle. They are the kind of men you would want on your side were you to go into battle. They would even go so far as to march into certain death. Verbal tells this dark yet enthralling story to Dave Kujan. He is investigating Keaton, and wants to find out more about him.
Dave Kujan recruits Verbal to talk to him about his experiences with Keaton and the story of this mans experiences draw the viewer closer and closer to the movies central question and ultimately it's unsolved mystery.

729595,5,6303908306,"The problem with trying to make a good film is that there's so much that can go wrong. No-one starts out to make a bad movie, but keeping control of every aspect of the process would test anyone's strength.
Not only do you have to cope with egotistical actors demanding that the part be played their way, and pretentious cinematographers insisting that the entire film be shot looking at the characters' feet, but you also have to juggle callous studio execs whose only intention is to drain the film of all its creativity so as to make it ""accessible to a wider audience"",... This is why 1995's The Usual Suspects is such an achievement. Everything about it reeks of quality.
Director Bryan Singer had only made one film before The Usual Suspects, 1994's Public Access. Despite only being a mini-budget piece restricted to art house cinemas, it managed to garner the attention of Kevin Spacey, then an accomplished stage actor looking for a break into mainstream cinema. Spacey approached the twenty-six year old and offered his talents, only to find that Singer had already written a part specifically with him in mind. The character was Verbal Kint, enigmatic narrator of The Usual Suspects. There followed a casting executive's dream roll call - Gabriel Byrne, William Baldwin, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollak signed on in short order, making arguably the best ensemble cast since Glengarry Glen Ross (in which Spacey also starred). Special mention needs to be given to Benicio Del Toro, whose hilariously erratic character Fenster steals every scene he's in.
Singer's long-time writing partner Christopher McQuarrie took a simple premise - five hardened cons meet in a New York lineup - and turned it into a stylish crime thriller of labyrinthine complexity with an ending that would become one of the most startling in cinema history, causing the viewer to reassess their opinion of the entire film in a way that would be emulated in later years by The Sixth Sense and Fight Club.
The Usual Suspects was shot in thirty days on a budget of five million dollars, which was a pittance when you consider that most romantic comedies cost at least twenty. Yet here was a film that did not shy from spectacle, with intense gun battles intercutting incredibly dense dialogue, edited together to look like a blockbuster of ten times its budget. The music, too, deserves special mention, with sweeping orchestral movements giving way to Cuban rhythms and delicate piano, echoing the depth and complexities of the story itself.
The film plays out like - and essentially is - a story told by a craftsman. In a nice twist, it begins with the death of the supposed central character (Gabriel Byrne in a wonderfully mysterious portrayal of an ex-con lured back into the game) and the rest of the film takes place almost entirely after the events it depicts. Spacey's character sits in a police office and recounts the story of five criminals thrown together in a lineup, deciding to go into business for themselves, only to learn that their fate is being guided by the hand of a terrifying arch-criminal, Keyser Soze. To reveal more of the plot is to spoil the film; suffice to say, one viewing will not be enough.
The Usual Suspects is that rare thing: A film in which no aspect is found wanting. Most movies involve the odd cringeworthy moment; a chunk of cheesy dialogue, a bad performance here or there, an unsatisfying ending - but Suspects oozes  quality in a way that the majority of modern films are not allowed to do, whether because of production companies clouding the auteur's vision, arsehole actors throwing their weight around, or simply bad luck and lack of funds. Perversely, Suspects' low budget could be the main reason for its success, since the filmmakers were given far more free rein to pursue their goals without studio executives breathing down their necks. And it shows. The Usual Suspects went on to garner two Oscars (Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Kevin Spacey) and assembled a following of committed devotees.

729660,5,6303908306,"I am glad that I waited for the ""Special Edition.""  In all honesty, I'm not really into the ""extras"" that some DVDs contain.  I've purchased or rented several DVDs in the past year, and I can count on one hand the number of times I actually bothered to check out the extra material.  Only Disney's ""Snow White"" had anything that was truly interesting.
THIS ""Special Edition"" had extras that were unique (the profanity-laced Gag Reel), and truly interesting (the featurettes that included interviews with actors, producers, screenwriters, etc.)  My wife and I especially enjoyed the interviews, because they explained how the actors came together to create the chemistry that was needed to drive the plot and keep viewers guessing until the very end.
To summarize, 5 con artists are thrown together in a police line-up, and after getting out, they decide to teach the NYPD a lesson for giving them a hard time.  Their act of revenge (more like a thumbing of the nose, or a flipping of the bird) eventually leads them to more criminal acts.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the mysterious Keyser Soze is pulling the strings and making the quintet dance to his own tune.  Just who is Keyser Soze?  That's the question that keeps viewers glued to the screen, as the plot goes through several twists while leading up to an awesome surprise ending!
Of course, I am truly biased, because this is my FAVORITE movie of all time.  I would have a difficult time understanding how anyone could not appreciate the good acting, fine screenplay, and surprise ending.  Kevin Spacey became a household name with his portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint, and Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri were perfect for their roles (a con man trying to go straight and a customs agent, respectively).  Benicio Del Toro's small part as ""Fenster"" was hilarious - a portrayal he dubs as his ""Mumbles"" (as in the bad guy played by Dustin Hoffman in the ""Dick Tracy"" movie).

729664,5,6303908306,"I was blown away by this film the first time that I watched it. Never before had I seen such a compellingly written crime story that becomes something more: a series of psychological mind games - the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind is
wow
It is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail. The story, so much as can be told, is that a ship caught on fire outside San Pedro, California, and only two people survived: a Hungarian with burns covering over half of his body and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a cripple from New York. The events are told via flashback, Kint describing how he hooked up with hardened criminals such as Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fenster, and his friend Dean Keaton, an ex-cop and ex-con just wanting to play it straight. As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.
This is not a movie for everyone. If in a crime story you need somebody getting whacked every minute and guns and explosives constantly, you might be a bit bored. Sure, there are all those things, but the emphasis of the movie is on its story and most of the film is dialogue. If you resent having your mind challenged and messed with, please do not apply. If you do not want to pay close attention to every scene to try to find out what's happening, some of the enjoyment might be lost. However, the beauty of The Usual Suspects is that nearly every loose end is tied up, except for one: What happened to Keyser Soze?
Excellent camerawork and sound help one get into the film. But more compelling is the acting. Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons. Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role. Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly. Kevin Pollak plays Hockney, a pyrotechnic who is worried about himself only. Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot. Kevin Spacey gives his most complex and mesmerizing role as Verbal, whose brilliance is in that he seems boring and ordinary, when, in fact, he is not. Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.
The extensive extras include deleted scenes (none of which really add anything to the story) a gag reel (the Keyser Soze rap song was hilarious) extensive documentaries and comentaries. Although they go through the processes of making an independent film, the director and screenwriter offer only a few insights into their craft. Alas, the film speaks louder than they could.
This film is genius, pure and simple. It is one of those ""questioning reality"" movies without the laws of physics being broken and machines trying to kill humanity off. This comes highly recommended.",1018483200,,3326,4.696917808219178

Side One has both the widescreen and P/S formated versions (although who still wants to watch a cropped film with pan&scan camera movements the director never made is beyond me). The transfer is high-definition with superb picture quality augmented by 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound. This film on this DVD looks better than when it was on the big screen. This side also features two running commentaries: the one by director Singer and screenwriter McQuarrie is the same one on the first ""Suspects"" DVD which was taken from a special limited edition VHS (Letterboxed film, same plus commentary, and a third box of ""collectables"". I think I was the only one who bought this!) The second commentary of by John Ottman, the editor and composer, and this one is a revelation to anyone who is interested in filmmaking, specifically ""putting the film together after the finished shoot"": editing and scoring. After my initial viewing of the film I really didn't think I could sit through it again right away, especially with the incredible dialogue subdued. But after listening to Ottman for five minutes, his enthusiasm became contagious and I was hooked. There is plenty here that ""Suspects"" fans will appreciate.
Side Two has all of the extras and there are plenty of them. Two half-hour documentaries, (""Pursuing the 'Suspects'"" and ""Doing Time with the 'Suspects'"") with the actors, Singer and Ottman. (I guess McQuarrie felt he did his part with the original commentary.) A twenty-minute documentary on ""Keyser Sose: Lie or Legend"" which is funny and informative.  Five deleted scenes introduced by Ottman (but it is easy to see why they were deleted) totalling ten minutes. Add ten minutes of trailers, TV spots, a seven minute gag reel introduced by Singer and some special ""Easter Eggs"" which I plan look for today (and probably watch the film again!) and you'll know everything you've wanted to know about ""Suspects"" and Mr. Sose.
There is finally some deserved praise for cinematographer, Tom Sigel, who made this ""$4 million dollar production look like a $50 million film."" Ottman, Singer and Gabriel Byrne also lament how this film, basically a rogue, independent production, could not be made today with studios rejecting originality and artists' visions in lieu of boilerplate plotlines, sequel-itis, and adapting films to their perception of what an audience wants after multiple pre-screenings. Byrne justly calls these ""MacMovies"" and I can't think of a more apt term.

Oh yeah, the revelation at the end is a complete surprise, and for a moment, the shock elevates the movie, but once you start to let reason enter in, you realize that everything else that has gone before in this story has been rendered utterly meaningless. You get involved in characters for ninety minutes, then discover you didn't really know them at all. Then my question to the viewer is: what is the point of the story? That a good story-teller can make time pass quickly? Come on. Many films with great surprise endings work within the story to shed new light on what has gone before (Sixth Sense, Memento), but his one completely throws out everything else in the movie, and says, ""Nyah, nyah, fooled you, and you sat there and listened to the whole thing!""

It has a great crime story and strong actors letting it all hang out, especially Gabriel Byrne as the one crook who finally figures out what's going on, but don't pretend that the ending is some brilliant twist. If you want to fall into the world of a story, you have to trust that it's a real world, and not one existing solely in the mind of one character. They could have  just as easily had a space ship swoop in at the end and scoop up Verbal, and it would have made just as much sense.",1017792000,,1574,4.40893470790378

The film marked the breakout of Kevin Spacey and helped him become a big star and win the first of his two Oscars.  The cast is full of superb actors including Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postelwaithe, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Espinosa and elicits a strong performance from the normally cringe inducing Stephen Baldwin.  The interplay between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Palminteri is the centerpiece of the film as the story unfolds in a flashback manner.  Mr. Palminteri is a cop who is grilling Mr. Spacey regarding a drug deal gone bad aboard a ship.  Throughout the story, the name of the mysterious Keyser Soze comes up and it is the identity of Mr. Soze that adds suspense and intrigue to the plot.  The ending is a true surprise and you really don't see coming even the clues are there all along. The Usual Suspects will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1017619200,2,1029,4.688888888888889

729792,5,6303908306,"In 1995 a film was made that not only gained commercial and critical acclaim but also made the career of one of the world's greatest actors, Kevin Spacey. 'The Usual Suspects' is a film like no other, a fabulous story, fantastic characters, a sympathetic protagonist and a twist that cannot be rivaled in modern cinema.
The story follows a group of five guys, all of who are convicted crims who are trying to keep their heads above water and avoid prosecution. However when they are all questioned in relation to the same crime this unlikely group of characters forge a plan to hit 'New York's finest taxi service' a group of corrupt cops who get kickbacks for taxing convicted criminals around the city. Through this job the group retreat to L.A where they continue to do criminal work, this escalates to a point where the five are sent down to the docks to stop a drug deal going down. It is here though that the narrative takes a turn that if mentioned will ruin the film.
The performances in the film are brilliant, as always Spacey's performance is amazing his pure air on camera makes the audience sit up and watch. In playing somewhat of a comic relief role Benicio Del Toro is fabulous and often hilarious. The work of Gabriel Byrne can never be underrated and in 'The Usual Suspects' he shines. Pete Poslethweight is the veteran on screen and plays Kobiashi, the personal lawyer to Kaiser Sozie and represents the antagonist in the piece who takes the five out of their hedonistic dream world and introduces them to the real world.
The direction in the film is masterful as the viewer truly gets a feeling of the nitty, gritty world of crime and is one of the few films where the twist isn't given away prematurely. Bryan Singer has truly created a masterpiece of modern cinema that has not been surpassed on the micro/macro level since. The film is faultless; there is nothing that can really be improved.

729795,5,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" is one of those movies that simply makes you say ""wow."" When I first saw this film in the theater, it was only because the movie that my wife and I wanted to see was sold out. Without knowing anything about it -- not a word -- we bought our tickets and headed into the auditorium. Little did I know that within the next two hours I would be witness to one of the finest pieces of moviemaking ever created.
Bryan Singer's wonderful direction and Chris McQuarrie's story are flawless. The movie engrosses from start to one-whopping-of-a finish and, like you've probably already heard, will make you want to see it again. The characters are memorable, with Benecio del Toro's and Steven Baldwin's roles really standing out. And Kevin Spacey, as in everything he does, is masterful.
When the film was first released on DVD, there were the ""usual"" extras, but now, finally, the masterpiece has been given the treatment it so rightfully deserves, with deleted scenes, better commentary, high-def transfer, and a whole truckload of stuff that fans of the movie -- and film buffs in general -- will cherish. A ""Special Edition"" was in order, and now, it's here.
""The Usual Suspects"" is a movie worthy of your time. This DVD will see to that -- I can guarantee it.",1015977600,28,1276,4.6755555555555555

Soze is depicted as a criminal mastermind who stays in the shadows, using people at every turn to attain his goals, which themselves lack clarity.

Of course, the police force is under his thumb.  Does anyone ever make a picture involving police in which they are not corrupt?  There must be a reason why the usual fare foisted onto the American theatergoer always, ALWAYS shows our paid public servants (police, FBI, CIA, prison officers, etc.) as worse than the criminals we pay them to catch and keep behind bars.

Anyway, this is a convoluted, confusing drama with a lot of explosions, violence and nastiness.  Probably a lot of people will enjoy it.

The Screenplay - without a decent screenplay, you have a bad film.  This is without a doubt an amazingly great screenplay.  It makes the film.  While it does borrow from old films from time to time, it is just so well done.  Good job, screenwriter! You got my vote for Eileen's Oscars as the Academy sometimes doesn't know what they are talking about.
The Acting - Totally awesome acting here.  Kevin Spacey, hands down, is the best actor around right now.  The rest of the cast is excellent.  Kudos to Chazz Palminteiri!! He is very convincing as the cop.  I love when he goes off on Verbal Kent about who Kaiser Sose really is. Little does he know...
The Plot -- This is a great story.  The first time you see it, you will not be sure who Kaiser Sose really is. I knew, but my husband begged to differ.
The ending  -- One of the BEST ENDINGS of a movie ever!! Well, next to Casablanca, it is the second best

729832,5,6303908306,"Wow! Not only does this film have some excellent casual moments of hilarity, some cooly executed violence, some great characters, but it has the finest twist I have EVER seen.
The basic story comes from a cripple, Spacey, as he recounts his story to cop Palminteri. It shows how a number of crooks were pulled together by a mysterious crime lord whose very existence is in dispute. The crew do a couple of jobs before getting taken out on a boat during a drugs money intervention.
Writer Chris Mcquarie spins the twist perfectly and I don't know of anyone that guessed it.
it would have been easy to steer the whole film toward the final revelation, in which case the finale would have, maybe, been expected. Mcquarie manages to wrap the whole film up, conclude with one twist, before pulling the carpet out from under us just as we thought it had finished.
this film is a true calssic and among my top ten. Definitely worth buying. I've seen it nearly ten times and the end still makes me smile. Excellent.

729883,5,6303908306,"San Pedro: the aftermath of what looks like a huge explosion dockside. The burning wreckage of a boat and the charred remains of bodies are being dragged out of the harbour by the authorities. It seems like the classic heist gone wrong scenario: five criminals trigger bloody mayhem in attempting to hijack the exchange of [money amount] worth of cocaine between Argentine and Hungarian gangsters. Only two men escape with their lives, one of the Hungarian gangsters, Arkosh Kovash, and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey in superb form), one of the five hijackers, and a cripple to boot.
In Bryan Singer's masterful directorial debut we learn how, six weeks earlier, the five men (Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Torro and Spacey) came together in the film's most famous scene - the police identity parade. The Usual Suspects line up for what turns out to be a trumped up police charge which none of them will admit to being implicated in. Locked up in the same cell for the night, they proceed to hatch a plot to rob New York's finest taxi service, a ring of corrupt cops who take bribes from criminals in return for immunity. Only Dean Keaton (the ever impressive Byrne) wants nothing to do with this plan. An ex cop turned criminal, with a reputation for absolute ruthlessness, Keaton is under investigation by FBI agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) despite his attempts to go straight. Keaton and Verbal are already acquainted after meeting in prison some years earlier, but Verbal is unknown to the others, and they will only include him in the job if Keaton is on board as well.
Through Kujan's interrogation of Kint we learn of the unfolding events and how he persuaded Keaton to become involved. The one flaw that each man shares is that he is addicted to committing crime, and predictably after the taxi service heist the men take on another job hijacking a consignment of diamonds. Unfortunately for them, they get involved with the wrong people and soon find themselves forced into taking on what seems like another, suicidal, job.
It becomes clear that there is more to the story than Verbal is letting on, but every time Kujan seems to be getting close to the truth, Kint goes off at a tangent. In parallel to this thread is the interrogation of the horrifically maimed Kovash, who is clearly dying, but before lapsing into unconsciousness in hospital manages to utter the name of the man who seems to be responsible for the carnage in San Pedro, ""Keyser Soze"".
The name inspires utter terror in Kovash and when Kujan mentions it to Kint, the same terror seems to take hold of him. Reluctantly, Verbal explains the myth of Keyser Soze - a mysterious underworld figure who every criminal has heard about, but whom nobody knows. Legend has it that back in the days when Soze was a relatively minor criminal in Hungary he butchered his own family rather than surrender to the local mob, proceeded to hunt down and kill his persecutors and their families, and then vanished, becoming a kind of bogey man for other criminals who, if they crossed him, inevitably came to a gruesome end.
A razor sharp script by Christopher McQuarrie (which won an Oscar for best screenplay), brilliantly taut and suspenseful direction and a fine ensemble cast make The Usual Suspects an electrifying experience. It possesses all the components to make it one of the best thrillers in recent memory, and will literally have you on the edge of your seat.

""Expletive laden/language"" - Well, folks, I've got news for some of the sheltered: real people talk like this. It happens every day. And the more violent, or direct, or less socially constrained people use this language. Get over it. It gives the movie an element of realism.
""Didn't feel for the characters"" - I can understand this one. These characters are rough, mean and relatively unforgiving. There is very little mercy in this entire movie, and it's a little disturbing for people used to Mel Gibson-type characters. Live with it. There are parts of the world all around us that exist in exactly this kind of mode. If that scares you, too bad. Realistic, or even kinda not-so-realistic looks at that are important.

""Makes no sense"" - *sigh* There are those who didn't understand the movie. That happens. But rest assured (those of you who haven't seen it) that all will be explained by the time the credits roll. If you saw The Matrix, and were not confused by it, then you should track this just fine. The key, of course, is to free your mind (unintentional, but I'm leaving it in) and be observant. Don't wander off in the middle of this movie without pausing it, or you'll miss some clues. ;)
For those of you who saw it, and thought it made no sense, looking at it this way might help: The entire story is about a story told by Verbal, and what Dave hears and sees, rather than what Verbal says and shows. Consider it.
Hope I didn't ruin it for anyone. I think this is a great movie, and the acting is simply first rate. Kevin Pollak is outstanding, and Spacey is god-like. Just fantastic! Bought it, no regrets at all.",1002585600,,1875,4.533923303834809

730086,3,6303908306,"The script is both the hero and the villaim in this film.  Undoubtedly well-written, with abundant (albeit expletive laden) wit, the script establishes characters of great potential interest but fails to develop them.  Gabriel Byrne's character in particular contains elements that beg to be explored - a former corrupt policeman, now reformed thief, in a relationship with a lawyer, trying to live legitimately, with ties to a club-footed conman: one might expect some complex and conflicting motivations to be played out in the plot - surprisingly, the character quickly becomes one-dimensional.  The fact that Kevin Spacey's conman is largely 'narrating' the film only deepens this problem, since he refuses to complicate his own relationship with any of the characters in the tale - he is an inarticulate 'friend' of Byrne, and simply distant and untouched by any of the others.  Frankly, I don't think the central conceit of the film necessitates this failing.  The convolutions of the plot actually boil down to a fairly straightforward premise, and when one finds this out, one can wonder why all the convolutions were necessary, and, for me, this makes it difficult to care about the film as a whole - it means the plot, while coherent, is poorly motivated, and as already mentioned the movie fails as a character study.  Still, the acting is by turns subtle, convincing and humorous, and the 'myth' of Kaiser Szozy (?spelling)  is a suggestive and cleverly dramatised idea.  The film is a highly polished product.  Yet I'm not sure why anyone would want to see this twice, aside from trying to fit a loose piece here or there into the overall puzzle - there are no illuminating insights into human nature, no compelling relationships, and the visuals while competent are hardly memorable.  It's a bit like seeing a skillful magicain perform a complicated trick - very entertaining, even thrilling, but with little connection to one's emotions.",999820800,7,1952,5.090909090909091
730087,2,6303908306,"Confusion remains the common denominator in ""The Usual Suspects,"" in which director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie are determined to create a fresh and inviting thriller, but come up empty. The star-studded cast is a delight to watch, but the film is so fixated on its own cleverness and originality that it quickly loses interest, deadening the impact of a surprise twist ending that may have worked had it had a better lead-up. Perhaps what makes the film so cumbersome is its shift from past to present, and vice-versa. Beginning with an explosion aboard a ship on which a shootout has just occurred, the movie then shifts back six weeks to the arrest of five men, all accused of stealing a van full of weaponry. Four of the men, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), concoct a plan of revenge against the NYPD, and the hesitant Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) joins in. After a deluge of plot twists and scenarios that seem completely out of place, the group finds themselves on the West Coast, at the mercy of a well-known man by the name of Keyser Soze, whose lawyer gives each of them a file documentation of their lives as watched by Soze. The motive: each of them has wronged Soze at some point in the past, and their chance for repentance comes with the raid on a cocaine deal set to go down in three days. All of this is narrated and seen in the mind of Kint, played with a fiendish glee by Kevin Spacey, who turns in a well-rounded performance. The rest of the cast also leave lasting impressions: Stephen Baldwin makes a great all-around bad boy, Benicio del Toro is increasingly witty, Kevin Pollack is the ideal picture of gruff and uneasy, and Gabriel Byrne instills in his character a growing sense of unease. But their talents are ultimately cast into a lost cause. ""The Usual Suspects"" manipulates its viewers to the end, taking us where only it wants to go, leaving no room for speculation or thought on the events at hand. It does this by throwing so much at the audience at once that the fear of missing out on something intrical to the overall plot becomes unbearable. In trying to think about what was going on, and watching each scene with full concentration, I almost went mad. In effect, the ending to Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay has little impact. You will be surprised at the movie's final turn of events, but the material prior to it lacks enough interest or even coherence to give the twist any logical sense. To me, the ending seems more like a blind leap towards greatness than a satisfying payoff to the film's convoluted script. Many will disagree with my thoughts on ""The Usual Suspects,"" and some may even recommend watching it twice to understand the film's twists. I did, and came up short both times. Aspirations of greatness are evident throughout the plot, but they amount to little more than just aspirations. As much as I wanted to understand the central story, I can't forgive a film that throws so much into the pot that the soup is too thick to thin out again.",999043200,8,3117,4.679417122040073
730088,5,6303908306,"Let me start off this review with a short story. One night, I was flipping around the channels looking for something to watch. I flipped to UPN and saw the final five minutes of ""The Usual Suspects"". Obviously I had no clue what was going on, and that was that for a couple months. Then while at my local video store, I saw that there was one more DVD left of it, so I figured 'what the hell' and I took it home to watch it. Towards the end of the movie, since I knew about how long it was, I thought to myself, they'd better have one hell of an ending for me to understand what happens in the end. Lo and behold it does have one hell of an ending! The action scenes aren't as exciting as say a Terminator movie, but the plot and actual story more than makes up for it. The five actors are great together and really make this movie's name ironic. Look out especially for Benicio del Toro in the criminal lineup, he's hilarious. I don't understand how there CAN be flaws in the movie, considering that the ending changes everything...I've said enough.",998870400,,1050,4.255

An excellent ensemble piece, admittedly with Spacey and Byrne giving standout performances in particular. Visually thrilling, vibrant, and smart...""Suspects"" is still being constantly analysed and discussed with joy by its viewers. The commentary for this DVD is also genuinely interesting and entertaining, with McQuarrie and Singer on fine form.  Incidentally, the reviewer below from Austin, TX, who states that the film is poor (which is utter nonsense!) and urges people to see a good Bryan Singer film such as ""LA Confidential"" instead - don't trust his/her opinion; if they can't spot that LA Confidential was directed by Curtis Hanson, not Bryan Singer, then it kind of casts their reviewing skills into doubt, doesn't it? :)

730165,5,6303908306,"...was making some people think this movie was NOT worth every bit of praise it received, and then some.  This film is a brilliant masterstroke--for director Bryan Singer, for writer Christopher McQuarrie, for all the cast of exceptional actors, and most notably, for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for finally getting it right.
Kevin Spacey steals your mind, logic, and ability to think of anything else than you just sitting back and following his tale of just WHO this Keyser Soze really is.
Some say the final scene kills the film; others say it perfectly caps off a brilliant plot-twister.  However you wish to see it, remember this when you get to that point in the picture:  you have been absolutely glued to this film, almost afraid to blink.  You, too, have fallen into Soze's world, and you, too, have been conned!!!
""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was making the world believe he didn't exist.""  You shall see the greatest trick in this film is Spacey's ability to completely stare straight and tell ""the truth.""  HA HA HA HA
The film's editing was sorely overlooked for awards--the quick motion makes the difficult story easy to follow, and keeps the flow of the crime mystery going.  The tight dialogue is great--filled with one-liners you'll be saying for weeks.  The cinematography is amazing, as is the moving score which evokes the old noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s.  Gabriel Byrne is in top, intense form, as is the unlikely pair of Kevin Pollack and Stephan Baldwin.  At the time, Benicio Del Toro was himself a newcomer, but you wouldn't guess it from his performance.  Theatrical oldtimer Pete Postlethwaite is amazing, as is Chazz Palmintieri...I can't say it enough!  EVERYONE IN THIS FILM IS GREAT!  THIS FILM IS GREAT!  I wish there were more films out there like this.
I won't tell you who Keyser Soze is:  you must discover that on your own.  But I will tell you this...if you haven't seen this, then WHAT the heck are you waiting for?  Even if you do have a ""fried drumstick"" for a leg, hobble on it as you run to get this film!",990576000,3,2091,4.669398907103825
730166,3,6303908306,"There's a cardinal unspoken agreement between a filmmaker and his audience.  The audience agrees to submit to his small world and let him drive for a couple of hours, and he in turn agrees not to abuse their trust in suspending their disbelief.  The Usual Suspects gleefully violates that agreement, and that is ultimately the weakest aspect of this film.  You may have heard this already, but the ending really does negate the entire film thanks to the storytelling device chosen.
Otherwise, it's a very well-crafted, well-acted, entertaining film.  Spacey in particular is continually being given kudos, but his performance has become somewhat overrated...Gabriel Byrne and Stephen Baldwin are easily as good if not better.
If you mind watching a whole film only to have a plot ""twist"" at the end that basically says ""oops...just kidding about all that"" (and lord knows I wouldn't blame you), you won't like this film.  If you're willing to overlook that fact, and just enjoy the journey for its own sake (even knowing that the destination makes the trip moot), then you'll enjoy it.
Oh, and pretending that you need ""higher intelligence"" to ""get"" this film is laughable.  How could anyone not get it...it bludgeons the audience with a plot sledgehammer.  And conversely, it doesn't take a genius to see the gaping black hole in the story by the movie's end either.
Technically, the DVD is a bit disappointing.  The image quality is not the greatest, the sound is poor (Dolby 2.0 only, not 5.1), and the only subtitles are spanish.  Ironically, the trailer included in the ""extras"" is in Dolby 5.1 though.  And one plus is that the filmmaker's commentary track is one of the better ones around.

Director Bryan Singer molds a tight and entertaining tale of five men, falsely brought in on charges of a stolen vehicle, then deciding to join forces and commit more crimes. What transgresses is a story of deceit, corruption and murder. Not only is the tale incredibly gripping, it is also downright hilarious at some points, making it such an enjoyable film. Kevin Spacey delivers an amazing performance as Verbal Kint, a scam artist cripple. Gabriel Byrne is great as the tough but compassionate Dean Keaton. Kevin Pollack delivers a strong and razor sharp comic relief role as Todd Hockney.

It combines incredible acting talent, riveting script, and direction that is remininsce of the classic thrillers of the 40's and 50's. Bryan Singer does a terrific job as the director, and Christopher McQuarrie's script is something all hopeful screenplay writers aspire to accomplish. The script won the Oscar, as well as Kevin Spacey, for Best Supporting Actor.
Kevin Spacey is a crippled ex-con who is brought into the police station after a boat full of 90 million dollars of drugs is blown up, along with several people. He then proceeds to tell the police what happened the past several weeks. A group of felons, including Spacey, is brought together for a lineup one night after a cop truck is hijacked, with all of it's illegal guns aboard missing. With no evidence, the police let them go. But the five men hatch a scheme to get even with the cops, resulting in a payoff for them, and a big ... for the cops. This scene is terrific, with the men taking money from a police ""Taxi"" service, and many officers indicted on transporting criminals in their squad cars for profit. This scheme shows how well the five work together, and sets up the rest of the movie.
Spacy then tells the cops that they went to California to lay low for awhile, until a much bigger caper appealed to them. I won't go into further details, but let me tell you that the intermix of scenes of Spacey's narrative and the story he tells is perfectly done. And you have to see the mind-blowing ending. The Usual Suspects is a great film, and I have high hopes that you'll enjoy it to.

I'll let all those reviews speak for themselves, and instead focus on why you should have this DVD of the movie, even if you know the plot backwards and forwards and quote your favorite lines with an obnoxious frequency.
The DVD is a must-have not only because it offers superb quality and near-perfect sound, but because you can set the audio track to suppress the dialogue and instead play running commentary director Brian Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie. They fill you in on all the clues you've missed (and you have missed some, even if you've seen the movie before), on interesting facts about the characters and locations, on what it took to get the actors to give their performances, and, best of all, amusing anecdotes about filming. In one 30-second driving scene, for example, 28 seconds were shot in LA, while 2 seconds shot in NY (just a view of the front fender of a van) were added to the sequence much later. While the big screen and VHS give you the pictures and sound, only the DVD also provides the very valuable director's commentary.

730263,5,6303908306,"An exceptional movie.  Basically it starts with the end of the movie and works its way back in flashbacks as Kevin Spacey's character Verbal Kint, relays his story to the investigators.
It starts when 5 small time crooks are gathered for a line-up on an arms truck theft.  They note the oddity of their being gathered for this line up, as it is rare they gather all felons for this type of thing,  but go on to consider this fortuitous, as they have a future heist that could use their combined skills. Verbal Kint the least capable of the group is only except after he talks Gabriel Byrne's character Dean Keaton, a former cop and felon, to return to his life of crime.
They have some successes which embolden them to go on to some more but wind up realizing their initial pairing up, is not as innocent as it seems.
A ""mystery"" figure in crimes circles Keyser Soze, through a middleman has asked them to do ""one final job"" with an incredible payoff.  It is very dangerous and not all of them are expected to survive.  Their cooperation is insured by demonstrating what happens when one of them tries to flee.  Additionally, not only they but the people important to them are in this net, to insure their cooperation.
I can't provide more details without ruining the story, but it was masterful.  Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal Kint was wonderful.  As he recounts the events to the police investigator, and pulls in inanities, you can see the mounting frustration the officers face in trying to figure out who the mysterious Mr. Keyser Soze is.  The police investigator is intent on proving Dean Keaton was the mastermind of these high jinxs and is not entirely convinced Keyser Soze exists.
This in my opinion was a facinating weave of a movie.  In the end you will find out if Keyser Soze exists.",978825600,,1800,4.579439252336448

I put my DVD player on ""shuffle play"" and let the scenes come up in any order - you'll see what I mean. One of my main measures for buying a DVD is how often I watch it, and you have to watch this a number of times just to appreciate all that goes on. It also takes a few passes to figure out what the heck Benicio del Toro's character is even saying in the semi-intelligible voice he has chosen. It's throwaway humor, but you've go to dig to find it. I loved it.
It's an exciting thiller and it's so FUNNY without breaking the mood. Many of the jokes are only understood in retrospect, though, making repeat viewing mandatory. Kevin Spacey is always aces, but he earns his Oscar as he introduces us to the story of Keyser Soze - a new name that everyone will know. Second best movie of the 90's - right behind LA Confidential.
Okay - that was the old review - I've since bought the special edition, and I highly recommend it. Deleted scenes and the blooper reel are so-so, but the discussions with the actors are fascinating, as is the trip to the Cannes film festival. Best bits were the discussions of the infamous lineup and the other actors' comments about Benicio's intentionally unintelligible dialogue.

Now, don't get me wrong, I found a lot of the plot quite entertaining, but pulling the rug out from under the viewer and wiping away 2 hours of movie in doing so doesn't instantly put me to my knees praising it.
Also, it tries to be a little too stylish at points, making the protagonists of the story pull off these wild heists and stunts, yet never showing set-up, and giving them the ability to do this just because they're ""really good"" at what they do.

Sometimes you get a film which people say is great because it has a wonderful car chase or there is a nice big explosion or the main character gets to say some wonderful one-liners. This film was being praised because it had a good story.
This caught my attention so I went to see it and have watched it many times since. Not because I didn't get it, quite the opposite in fact. I understood the film but I just loved the experience of watching a brilliant story unfold so mcuh that I wanted that experience again and again.
Can there be anyone out there who hasn't heard about this excellent film? How can I convince you to rent this, to buy it or just to plain sit down and watct it? Simple - if you like to watch a good film that is far more than car chases, explosions and witty one-liners then this is it.
From the intriguing opening scene as we watch a ship go up in flames, the film slowly unfolds a story of how weeks before five men were brought together for a police line-up. Not just any five men, but five criminals who should not have been brought together at all. Plotting revenge against the NYPD for this harrasment is only the beginning and slowly but surely we begin to hear about this underworld myth - Keyser Soze. A powerful underworld lord who may or may not exist. Could it because of him that these five men were brought together? If so, what does he want from them and will they be willing to help him achieve that goal?
Watch it and find out, I just hope that the arms of your chair are strong enough because you will be gripping them!
The DVD is generally quite good, there is minor digital noise at the start but it is not distracting. The film is not enhanced so you will either have to enlarge your screen or put up with it in 2.23:1.

730345,5,6303908306,"""The Usual Suspects"" certainly defies pigeon holing or labeling. Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Pschodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!)
But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from  viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.
On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried beliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.
Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, stategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.
What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmititgated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out,""I piss on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!
""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another Amazon reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching  ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!
Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with  a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre becuase of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO JOHN WOO FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...GET IT AND SEE IT!",969926400,22,3602,5.228373702422146

Like when a band covers a song, everybody thinks they  wrote it. But I shouldn't be too hard on it, all good ideas come from  somewhere, the author of this screenplay, Christopher MacQuarrie, just got  to it first is all.  In this case, in order for a complex idea to appeal  to a mass audience, they had to dummy it down into a crime picture full of  empty hoodlums. Gabriel Byrne would have been a believable Keiser Soze  simply because he was the only interesting character, the natural leader of  the group; for that he made the least likely Soze. I should have figured  out the ending sooner, I just didn't expect that this wonderful idea would  be wasted on this shallow, unnecessarily violent film. I don't cringe at  movie violence, but when it's done ""well"", like in Goodfellas or  Pulp Fiction, I do get a little shiver down my spine, thankful that I'm  only watching it and not in the room with these people. This film has none  of the tension, just one bloody scene after another.  People who are  amazed at the ending probably don't realize that it's been done before.  Years after reading Foundation, I still feel a sense of wonder at its  twists and clever manipulation. After watching the Usual Suspects, I threw  my hands in the air and went to bed, knowing it's going to spoil it for  anything that tries to use this idea later, disappointed that people might  think this film is a one-of-a-kind original.

The whole movie  drew me in with the masterful acting by Byrne, Del Toro, and (sorry  American Beauty fans) the performance of Spacey's career that won him his  first oscar.  The movie enticed me to figure out its intracacies, to try to  make my own assumptions about the convoluted story, and make my decision on  who the infamous Keyser soze was.
It continued along, foggy enough to  keep me guessing, but intriguing enough to be brilliant.  And then, THE  ENDING.  The end of this movie (I wouldn't dare give it away) is the single  finest cinematic moment ever. Period.  I don't care about Rosebud or  ""Here's lookin' at you kid"" or any one of the many scenes in The  Godfather.  The end of the Usual Suspects is AMAZING.

The characters  include five criminals, Dean Keton, a retired criminal who now is  romantically involved with a criminal lawyer, and they have gone into the  restaurant business together.  keton is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is  well-cast, but not as well-cast as he is in End of Days, where he plays the  devil.  Stephen Baldwin plays McManus, a loud, crazy, but effective entry  man.  He plays this sort of role to a T, but he has been type-cast for his  career thanks to his role.  Kevin Pollak plays Todd Hockney, the explosives  expert, who doesn't care about anyone.  Pollak is great at this kind of  role, and he has some great lines.  Benicio del Toro, in his breakthrough  role, is hilarious as a wisecracking criminal with a speech impediment.  The speech impediment, where he mumbles constantly, makes him hard to  understand, but it's very, very funny.  And finally, to round out the  criminals, Verbal Kint, a cripple, played by the not yet so famous Kevin  Spacey.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in this movie.  This is his best acting  job ever.  He won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work, and  it is well deserved.  The opening lineup scene is a classic, and is  possibly the greatest opener ever, second only to the Diner Scene, from  Reservoir Dogs.  The story is told by Kevin Spacey, who is the sole  survivor of a mass slaughter in the San Pedro harbor, involving a ship.  The five men were sent to destroy coke on a boat by the mysteriously shifty  Keyzer Soze, who has never been seen by anyone, that has lived to tell the  tale.  Spacey is telling his account to U.S. Customs Agent David Cuyan, who  has a personal vendetta against Keton.  The movie jumps around a little,  but by the second viewing it is easy to follow.

This is the sort of movie that holds up to repeated viewings.  A great  script, great performances (especially by the wonderful Kevin Spacey),  entertaining, spooky at times, and thought-provoking.

730455,5,6303908306,"Bryan Singer's artful direction of Christopher McQuarrie's ingenius  script, as well as perfect casting, make The Usual Suspects a film  impossible to forget.  David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) , an agent for U.S.  customs, has to find out why 27 people were massacred in Long Beach Harbor.  His only source of information, a crippled man, the only one to make it  out unscathed.  Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) procedes to tell his story of  five criminals who, after being somewhat wrongly accused of a crime, decide  to get back at the cops.  The success of their revenge leads to an even  bigger job, this time for the elusive and feared Keyser Soze.  A man each  character inadvertently crossed, the job is penance and appeasment to the  powerful mobster, a man no one is even sure exists.  Keaton (Gabriel Byrne)  is a cool headed professional, who insists that everything be thought out.  McManus (Stephen Baldwin) is a rash, quick to anger thug. Fenster (Benicio  Del Toro) ia a smart ass with a speech impediment.  Hockney (Kevin Pollack)  is a sarcastic, suspicious loner.  These four, plus Verbal Kint find out  that Keyser Soze is all too real, but who is he?  The last five minutes of  this movie will tell you just that as well as make you rethink the entire  film.  A must see movie, one of the best films of the 1990's.  The only  confusing part about this movie is how Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting  Actor Oscar when he's in 90% of this movie, he should have won Best Actor!  Oh well.

730457,5,6303908306,"If you snooze you lose. I know it's a bad saying, but it's good advise to use before watching `The Usual Suspects'. Although it's almost impossible to fall asleep during this film, if you do it's not worth trying to  recuperate. There is so much information crammed into two hours of film,  one minute of not paying attention will require at least ten minutes of  explanation.
The film begins with the ending when a cargo ship, docked  in the New York City harbor, blows up. Behind a clump of boating equipment,  we see a scared Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), watching a man in black kill  Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), blow up the ship, and then walk away. Now the  plot is set. Through the police questioning of Mr. Kint, done by inspector  Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), we go back to before the ship's land siege,  finding out about a  police line-up, and the mysterious man in black named  Kayser Soze.
Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete  Postlethwaite, Stephen Baldwin, Garbriel Byrne, and others, along with a  brilliantly written screenplay, make The Usual Suspects one of the best  thrillers and most unpredictable films of all time. I bet you can't watch  it only once.",963792000,,1186,4.773399014778325
730458,3,6303908306,"When the Usual Suspects was first released, it polarized critics and audiences alike.  Some lauded the film for it's sinuous, unpredictable plot and nimble direction.  Others dismissed it as tediously complex and  incomprehensible.  As with most such films the truth (if I may be so  presumptuous) is found between the two extremes.
The plot revolves around  a police interview with a disabled criminal (Verbal Kint) and a detective  (Dave Kujan).  Verbal was one of five individuals who were blackmailed to  rob a ship by a mysteriously unidentified criminal mastermind named Keyser  Soze.  The other four were killed during the robbery attempt.  Dave is  questioning Verbal to find out what happened.  The film contains several  flashbacks as told by Verbal.  The film does not reveal the identity of  Soze until the conclusion.
The characters in the film are generally well  acted, but superficial; they only serve as vehicles to propel the plot.  There isn't anything intrinsically wrong with this, but it proves to be a  crucial flaw later on.
The story of The Usual Suspects is very intricate  and difficult to follow.  Though this makes the film challenging at times,  it's often so convoluted that I was often tempted to give up on it.  During  the interview, Verbal eventually gives contradictory accounts of what  happened.  This a crucial element of the story that will determine how the  viewer interprets the ending, either with genuine surprise or  disbelief.
The conclusion is what seems to make viewers love or hate this  film.  Most people seem to be genuinely surprised (though some have said  they weren't at all) by the identity of Soze.  Though surprising, the  ending seems to require that the viewer suspend a tremendous amount of  disbelief:  It just doesn't SEEM to make sense.  It would be one thing if  the film out-smarted me, I would have appreciated that.  Instead, the  implausibility of the conclusion left me feeling cheated.
If the film  is examined more closely it may make more reasonable sense than it seems  (it is complicated enough to allow this possibility), but the superficial  nature of the characters doesn't motivate the viewer to do this.  The  characters aren't interesting enough to make us want to understand the  conclusion.  I don't think this flaw completely detracts from the strengths  of The Usual Suspects, but it is certainly significant.
The Usual  Suspects does have quite a bit going for it:  Riveting direction,  interesting dialog, good acting, and a very clever (if often  incomprehensible) plot.  The screenplay and story have many of the same  elements as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  What makes Pulp Fiction a superior  work is that Taranino never pretends to make the film more than what it is:  A clever, unpredictable piece of storytelling, making the viewer feel  surprised and satisfied.  In The Usual Suspects, Singer seems to tease the  audience into thinking that there is more to the film than there truly is  (or at least seems).  Consequently, the viewer feels short-changed.
The  Usual Suspects has been most accurately likened to a cinematic card trick:  While you are watching it, the slight of hand is entertaining the first  time you see it.  Once the trick is finished, you probably won't think  about it again.  The Usual Supects is worth seeing for it's considerable  initial entertainment value, but once you find out the ending, what  occurred before is no longer interesting (or relevant).  Since it conveys  no emotional resonance, the film isn't worth seeing more than once, and  certainly isn't one of the best films of the 1990's.",963619200,5,3621,5.045996592844975

730521,5,6303908306,"The most useful advice I can give you about this film is this:
Do
not read any more of this review or any other review before you see
it. In fact, don't even read the box. See it knowing as little as
possible, I saw this film totally cold and really enjoyed it and was
totally surprised. I think it's easily the best film I've seen in the
last ten years.
....
The casting and
acting is exceptional. The highlight of the film is the line-up scene
which is really funny (the director filmed the scene a number of times
and chose the best take) but the film as a whole is of a very high
standard and will keep you guessing until the end.
....
Kevin Spacey is brilliant and did win an Academy Award for his
role but everyone else is just as exceptional. Particular attention
should be paid to Stephen Baldwin who finally found a role and a movie
that can really demonstrate that his talent. As the hyperactive
McManus who knows no fear and has some of the best dialogue in the
film to boot.
There isn't a weak link in the film and the 5 actors
who are ""the usual suspects"" convey exceptionally a group
who find themselves trapped into a job that is seemingly unachievable
but come agonisingly close to carrying out the impossible. As McManus
says as they survey the mission that seems like certain doom
""There's nothing that can't be done."". Through sheer
bravado, they very nearly pull it off.
Will you like this film?
Well, with any one person it will be impossible to predict but the way
ratings systems like this always work, as most people have given this
film 4 or 5 stars, it means odds are you probably will.
A great film
which won the writer, Christopher McQuarrie an Academy Award for Best
Original Screenplay and a must see.",962150400,2,1731,4.395638629283489

Besides  the awesome ending, the performance by Kevin Spacey is brilliant!",961545600,,286,4.916666666666667
730523,5,6303908306,"When I read these reviews, I was amazed to see that hardly anyone mentioned the incredible performance of Benicio Del Toro. As Fenster, Del Toro's abilities as one of the finest charcter actors of our time shine.  His unusual delivery,  impeccable timing, physical acting and expressive  features allow him to give his character amazing depth. He creates layers  for his characters and systematically peels them back. His mumbling,  hiariously accented delivery of his lines and his jerky movements provide  the film with the comic releif it needs. You may not know what to make of  Fenster (or even what he's saying), but you're garanteed to laugh. Del Toro  has amazing charisma and steals all of his scenes. My only complaint with  the film is that he doesn't get enough screen time. With several films  coming out soon, he will hopefully get the recognition he deserves. I can't  praise him enough- he is fantastic.  In addition to Del Toro's magnetic  performance, Kevin Spacey's portrayl of Verbal Kint is womderful. Both men  are tremendous physical actors, defining their characters through their way  of moving and speaking. Spacey's acting is so different from that of a  typical Hollywood star that I'm not at all surprised by some of the  negatice reactions to it.  However, Spacey plays a man who himself must act  during his testimony, which justifies his somewhat self-conscious and  akward performance. The rest of the cast is also terrific, with the  possible exception of Gabriel Byrne, whose performance seems strained at  times. Stephen Baldwin is a real surprise- he creates a volatile and  violent character. Kevin Pollack's charcacter provides a sarcastic and  down-to-earth center for the more flamboyant cast members. Both Palminteri  and Postlethwaite give strong performances. As for the plot twist at the  end- it may not be entirely surprising, but it doesn't negate the entire  film. Most of the major events have to have happened for proof of them  exists. The point is that Soze wanted to destroy the men who were in his  way without giving away his identity or that of his colleagues. I also  think he wanted to have a little fun with the arrogant cops. Regardless of  the ending, the movie is worth seeing if only for the acting. It is also  stylishly directed and filmed with a smart and darkly humorous script.",960768000,,2346,4.966494845360825
730524,5,6303908306,"It's been five years since the release of The Usual Suspects, so you should have gathered by now that there's a bit of a twist at the end. (Don't worry - nothing shall be given away.)
The first time you see this  film, it's the twist that will blow you away, leaving you gasping for air  on your sofa, unable to stop grinning at the sheer brilliance of the final  loop-the-loop in the rollercoaster ride that is the incredible script.  You'll notice the acting and the dialogue, of course, but it's the ending  that will stick in your mind.
Wathc it again, however, and it's a whole  new experience: just take a look at the little titbits that were missed the  last time round but can be enjoyed even more now that you know how it turns  out. The twist will still hit you, but it's not as strong.
The third  time, however, is the real turning point. This viewing will ensure that the  dialogue is imprinted on your mind, and the fantastic performances won't be  forgotten in the fog of amazement that the ending pumped out the first  couple of times. When it comes, the denouement won't be such a thrill any  more, but on the plus side, you'll enjoy the two hours or so that precede  it even more.

730525,5,6303908306,"One of the most important ingredients to a good adventure story is a great villain.  Lord of the Rings has its marvelous villain, Sauron, and its fantastic secondary villains, the Ringwraiths.  The Usual Suspects has one  of the finest villains I've ever come across in a movie, scary Keyser Soze.  This is a man who (allegedly - since we can't be sure of anything we're  told) murdered his own family.  I think it was a good touch to make him a  Turk.  (He is a Turk isn't he?)  Nice choice for a westerner's fantasy of  the most depraved villain on earth, a dangerous ""Young Turk"".  Picture him with a scythe carving up his wife and kids.  I dwell on this  because Keyser Soze, horrid murderer, is the appeal of the movie and what  the whole plot and surprise ending are about.  To those reviewers who say  they weren't surprised by the ending, all I can say is you're too damn  smart for your own good, and I'm in Mensa, and I was surprised at the damn  ending, so go rain on somebody else's parade, showoff.

730528,5,6303908306,"Enough praise has been heaped on this movie, that I feel I can focus just on the DVD itself.  (Note: one of my favorite movies of all time).  Specifically, I'd like to praise Bryan Singer and Christoper MacQuarrie for  their director's commentary track.
When we got our DVD player last  year, the first DVD I rented was The Usual Suspects.  We watched the movie  all the way through (probably our 10th time seeing this film), and then put  on the movie with the director's commentary soundtrack, thinking we'd see  what it sounded like and watch it later.  Two hours later, we realized that  we had just watched the movie twice in a row.
Singer and MacQuarrie  speak in depth about writing this movie, about setting up the shots, about  all the background detail in the movie, about the technical details such as  sound, editing, and film score.  I learned more about filmmaking from  listening to their commentary than I have reading books on the subject.  Since Singer and MacQuarrie are friends and business partners, it was  entertaining to listen to their exchange; it was like getting the inside  scoop from your best friends who happen to be filmmakers.  I was enthralled  the entire time.
Since this was the first commentary I'd ever  experienced, I figured it was standard for DVD director's commentaries to  be so thorough, informative, and entertaining.  I was wrong.  I have yet to  find another commentary this interesting, although I've experienced some  awful commentaries (The Matrix) and one that was almost as good (The Prince  of Egypt).

730580,5,6303908306,"Every now and again, a film emerges from the Hollywood ooze to completely redefine the preconceptions of its genre.  Examples of this welcome trend include ""Unforgiven,"" ""Blade Runner"", and ""The  Lost Boys"", to name an eclectic few.
""The Usual  Suspects"" does for crime thrillers what ""Alien"" did for  science fiction--it causes fans to reevaluate what drew thm to the genre in  the first place and rekindles their enthusiasm for it.
Usually, movies  of this sort tend to have largely-unknown casts.  ""The Usual  Suspects"" is all the more remarkable for having an all-star cast, akin  to ""The Dirty Dozen"".  Chazz Palmintieri plays the hard-nosed  customs official determined to get to the bottom of a drug deal gone bad;  Gabriel Byrne plays a criminal struggling to hove to the  straight-and-narrow, Kevin Spacey shines as the handicapped reluctant  informant Verbal Kint, while Kevin Pollack and the remainder of the cast  represent a cross-section of modern thuggery.
This sordid bunch is  brought together in a lineup for a crime none will own up to, during which  they decide to team up for a daring raid on a drug lord's haul.  As with  ""Reservoir Dogs"" and other classics of the genre, things go  downhill fast from there.
Much of the action is relayed in the form of a  flashback from Verbal Kint's interrogation.  Anyone who doubts Spacey's  status as the finest actor in film today need only reference his role here  as the complex Kint to become true believers.
It would be a crime to  reveal any more of the plot ir the astonishing climax, but suffice it to  say that if you enjoy the way tightly-plotted movies like ""The Sixth  Sense"" or ""Presumed Innocent"" pull the rug out from under  you just when you think you know the score, ""The Usual Suspects""  will make your night, or my name isn't Keyszer Soze.",958953600,,1819,4.814935064935065

It's one of those  movies that you definitely put on pause to discuss a point with friends or  since you don't want to miss anything, before you go to the fridge.

Sadly, too many people have already commented on ""the  twist"", which only excites speculation amongst those who have not seen  it and will lead to premonition in a sad number of cases.  But what I love  about this film is the CHILL I get (I've seen this maybe 6 times over the  years) each time when the characters come to realize the situation for what  it is.  This scene makes my neck hairs stand on end, and it is one entirely  devoid of action.

It was nice to see a crime  film that didn't ape Pulp Fiction, instead carving out its own niche as a  cerebral, eloquent film about betrayal, deception, fear, redemption (or the  impossibility of redemption), and identity.  One of the grandest tricks in  The Usual Suspects is to create a thoroughly winning hero, yet forcing you  to applaud the ingenuity of the victorious villains at the end.

730714,5,6303908306,"Sometimes a movie really surprises you, really blows you away for some reason. I saw ""The Usual Suspects"" not really expecting anything interesting. Well, I was wrong. Instead I got to see a terrifically  exciting movie featuring outstanding acting and a plot twist that actually  caught me by surprise.
The plot? Following a bloody shoot-out aboard a  ship moored at a Santa Monica pier, the police question a hood by the name  of Verbal Kint in an attempt to learn about what happened. We see several  different possibilities and the final answer we get is a real surprise.
Typically movies rely upon special effects, left-field plot twists, and  brand-name casting to get the job done. ""The Usual Suspects""  relies on an excellent script, good direction and wonderful acting from  people who might not necessarily be household names. Look at this cast-  Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin  Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Dan Hedaya, and Pete Postlethwaite. This is some  serious acting talent to behold. They all are great, but in particular  Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton) and Kevin Spacey (Verbal Kint) deliver  exceptional performances. Neither man is quite who they seem to be. Spacey  won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance in this film.
Director  Brian Singer does a brilliant job coaxing terrific acting performances from  his cast. This was a tought movie to make and he pulled it off in  spades.

730715,2,6303908306,"This movie was too confusing to be enjoyable, but that's probably what the director and screenwriter wanted - a film that baffles the viewer and leaves the audience 'guessing' until the end.  Bah!  In the effort to  appeal to the movie-goer by way of ambiguity and mystery, this movie loses  its luster.  Perhaps if the makers of this film had a goal other than to  baffle the viewer, the plot would have been better.  Instead, the director  concentrated on the audience rather than the film itself.  Additionally,  while the movie does have a few twists coupled with a surprise ending, it  is nothing unique.  Like many other films, this one has the same gun play,  murder, and ultimate 'bad guy.'  This film is nothing special, and I am  surprised that so many people found it 'amaxing.'

730769,5,6303908306,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that elicits extremes of either like or displeasure. As far as The Usual Suspects is concerned, I have friends who say that this is a movie too enamored of its own convoluted  inventiveness to rank among the all-time classics: Personally, I disagree  and  think this is a masterpiece of a movie. Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar  winning screenplay, skillfully brought to life by director Bryan Singer, is  a patchwork of elements that combine to thrill the viewer and draw you ever  deeper into the intricate web of the plot.  Kevin Spacey deservedly won an  Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, the club-footed short con artist  who gets mixed up with a gang of hardened felons - delightfully played  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro - but  all is not as it appears.
The central theme of the movie is one of  detection: Who is the criminal mastermind  Kyser Sze ? Does he exist and  if so, who is he?  The five crooks find themselves forced by Sze's  supposed lawyer, wonderfully played by the British actor Pete  Postlethwaite, into performing a daring raid to interrupt a cocaine deal -  but is this really the reason for the ninety-one million dollar exchange?  The story is recounted by Spacey to the investigating customs officer,  played by the skillful Chazz Palmintieri, in ever increasing levels of  complexity.  The to and fro between Palmintieri and Spacey is a delight to  watch but it would spoil the experience to describe the scenes in too much  detail.  Suffice it to say that the end is not what we are led to expect!  This movie is an all round pleasure: the writing inventive, the acting  delightful, and the visual clues are a creation of the writer and director  that require a second viewing to fully appreciate.

Why do we get such a  poor quality transition to DVD. There are too many moments, especially the  dark scenes, where it looks like you're watching a trailer downloaded from  the internet, the digitisis it shows. And why isn't the widescreen version  enhanced for widescreen TV's. Instead of, like on the better discs, where  you can stretch the image you have too zoom in, therefore decreasing the  picture quality more. And, OK, the commentary is very interesting, but they  keep going on about these great outtakes they had, but they're not on the  disc.

The first time that I saw its surprise ending, I felt as if I had been kicked very hard in my stomach. It was  amazing, and I ended up seeing the movie in the theater seven times.
When  the movie came out on VHS in 1996, I bought it immediately. When I bought a  DVD player in the beginning of 1999, it was the first DVD that I bought. I  have seen the movie a total of about 40 times.
Christopher McQuarrie's  Oscar winning script is brilliant. Every line counts. There are so many  details packed into the movie that it requires multiple viewings, perhaps  even as many as a dozen, to be fully appreciated. And even after that it  still gets better with each viewing. Bryan Singer's directing is based on a  love of movie making and a very strong, deep respect for the intelligence  of the audience. All of the acting perforances, from the major players like  Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, down to minor roles such as Suzy Amis's, are all  done to perfection. Newton Thomas Segal's camera direction helps to give a  classy, 1940s feel to the movie which makes it all that much more  interesting. John Ottman's musical score and editing are the final seal in  making this movie absolutely perfect. A definite must see.",945475200,10,1323,4.5

Better still, the screenwriters were kind enough to give us a clever plot  which whipsaws us between different versions of what might have happened,  always making the viewer question what actually happened.

I didn't really think much of Kevin Spacey before  this movie, but after this one performance, I was hooked.

Kevin Spacey gives one of the best of his always cool, always creepy  performances; personally, I think he should have been nominated for best  actor since everybody else seems to be supporting his contribution to the  film.  If this movie has one flaw, it's that the main bulk of the story is  too complicated to understand upon a first viewing--you probably won't  understand much of what goes on until the second or third time you see it,  after you already know the movie's big secret.  And about the movie's  surprise ending, the people who claim that The Usual Suspects dies once you  know its tricks are completely incorrect.  Think about Psycho or Citizen  Kane or The Empire Strikes Back, movies that all end with mind-warping  twists like this one; they're actually more entertaining when you watch  them again because you get to see how the filmmakers build up to the big  conclusion, and because you get to trace all the little clues that make the  final revelation seem painfully obvious now that you already know what it  is.

What was likely the breakout role for Kevin  Spacey is quickly becoming a cult film noir worthy of quality DVD  collections and has even reached the level of being consistently quoted by  fraternity boys... ""Give me the keys ...""
Joining Spacey is  Stephen Baldwin (one of those Baldwins) which turns in a solid performance  as a slightly nuts, yet cool under pressure, McManus (also check him out in  Threesome); Chazz Palminteri (Analyze This, Bullets over Broadway) plays a  tough acting fed who gets played like violin; Benicio Del Toro who does a  great job with smooth Fenster. I'll stop here, but the whole cast is  great.
The beauty of this movie is how the story develops and leads your  little brain into believing the events, names and characters that populate  it.  And when the puzzle finally seems to come together and you think you  are so cool for having ""known it all along"" and satisfied to have watched a  great movie, director Bryan Singer and writer Chris McQuarrie tear the  puzzle apart like your mean older brother would do only to leave you with a  thousand pieces that could come together in a completely other way.

Also, a must-see for action or  ""whodunit"" lovers.  Now MY only question is, what's Maltin  talking about??  The film's twists and turns are EXPLAINED by the film's  knockout ending, not obliterated by it.  Watch closely and it's all very  logical.  Maltin (and the amazon.com reviewer) fell asleep on the job on  that one -- disregard them.  The film never sacrifices cleverness for style  -- it's a Chinese puzzle-box, with every clue falling into place for those  who look closely.",939081600,,656,4.758928571428571
730992,5,6303908306,"i was very sleepy when i watched the movie for the first time,but then i jumped up at the end and laughed so so hard, cuz I SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SEE. now i have the VHS and i've watched it over and over again with  friends(some hated it cuz they weren't paying attention) but now i'm  waiting for the DVD of it cuz i always believe you should get the best of  anything,especially a masterpiece like TUS.

731054,5,6303908306,"An incredible achievement for Brian Singer. An extraordinary film that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. The climax comes near the end of the movie with an ingenious surprise. The flashbacks are suspenseful  gripping your mind making you rethink your own instincts when the film is  over. The film demostrates how people stereotype charecteristics in others  and how we can be wrong on our own judgements. Pay very close attention to  names in this movie or you are going to lose track of what is going on.  Kevin Spacey recieved a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role and  because of this movie, I rent other movies with him in it. Destined to be a  classic or in the hall of fame of films. Very similar style to Stephen  King. A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN IT!! A collectors item if you  have it on DVD or VHS.",933379200,,837,4.383116883116883
731055,4,6303908306,"Within it's intricate plot and dialogue, this movie has you reeling from the beginning to end.  And, as the saying goes, ""Life mimics art.""  In this movie it does so by having you thinking about how  simple it all is.  Just catch Kaizer Soczey (sorry for the spelling, but if  I'm wrong, then you spell it!), and we've solved our problem. But then you  realize that the true evil has been right under your nose the entire time.  By that time, it's too late, because, as Spacey says in what turns out to  be the final phrase of the movie, ""POOF.  Like that, he's  gone...""",932342400,,571,4.352380952380952

731189,5,6303908306,"The Usual Suspects is one of those films that doesn't come around that often.  The sheer brilliance of it just pulled me in and right when I thought I had solved the mystery, the plot twisted again.  It wasn't just  the storyline that was utterly enjoyable, however, but the characters and  the script as well.  Watching such a serious and complex picture is  extremely difficult without some comic relief, and that was provided  exceptionally by Del Toro's Fenster and Pollak's Hockney.  My favorite  element of the entire film, though, was without a doubt, Kevin Spacey.  I'm  not saying everyone should share my opinion because he is my favorite  actor, but to me his performance was absolutely flawless.  This is a movie  I will watch again and again and never grow tired of.",919814400,,779,4.803030303030303
