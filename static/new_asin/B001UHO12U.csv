3798826,5,B001UHO12U,"I have to admit I'm developing an appreciation of Sylvester McCoy's Doctor Who.  At first, I intensely disliked his characterization; but as I've watched more episodes of the McCoy era, I'm rapidly changing my opinion of him.  He rarely gets ruffled and almost never deviates from his plan, even when conditions change.  And I find his distinct costume far less clownish than, say, Tom Baker or Colin Baker's - even with his ever-present umbrella. This particular episode, ""Delta And The Bannermen,"" seems like the quintessential Sylvester McCoy vehicle.  The story is quite good; and, like others of the McCoy era, quite unique: a genuine ""stand-alone"" episode.  You don't know immediately which are the ""good guys"" and which are the ""bad guys,"" so that alone engages your interest from the very start.  And each step of the way, as the peril grows, there's enough busy-work to keep your interest.  Plus, the very notion of a literal ""time-share"" vacation is, in itself, interesting.  All in all, a great episode - McCoy's sidekick Mel notwithstanding.",1257465600,3,1053,5.0813953488372094
3798827,4,B001UHO12U,"Much like the first two James Bond movies after Roger Moore took over the roll, the first couple of Sylvetster McCoy episodes of Doctor Who are hit and miss affairs.  There are times when you can see consistency trying to emerge, but basically all concerned with the 7th incarnation of the Doctor are trying to see what fits.  However, 'Delta and the Bannermen' is probably the first real glimpse of the Doctor we are going to enjoy until 1989.  The story (concerning an Enlish holiday camp in the 1950s and an invading alien race) walks the fine line between slapstick and genuine adventure.  Most of the McCoy episodes did this, mixing Sylvester McCoy's talent for physical comedy and machine-gun speech patterns with his sympathetic nature and concern for his travelling companion (which would later be perfected by the arrival of Ace, an almost perfect pairing of a Doctor with a companion).  There is a lot of physical comedy in any McCoy episode, but the scripts also contain genuine wit and intelligence.  McCoy himself is highly likeable and the imagery contained in much of his run as the Doctor is the most arresting to be seen on television since 'The Prisoner.'  And all done with a miniscule budget.  Dr Who has always been a great example of script and intelligence over budget and special effects, and the McCoy run of shows is no exception.  'Delta and the Bannermen' (as well as many of the other episodes) offer funny, exciting and well-acted television.  The McCoy years are filled with high-energy, and this has sometimes been confused with mere slapstick.  This is not the case, though.  Sylvester McCoy combined his physical comedic skills faster paced productions (these episodes can actually be called exciting)and top-notch scripts to deliver two memorable seasons.  I agree, he took some time finding his feet, but once they landed firmly on 'Delta and the Bannermen', there was no looking back for the 7th Doctor.",1253232000,7,1940,4.932307692307693
3798828,4,B001UHO12U,"Right in the middle of ""Delta and the Bannermen"" is a dotty old Welshman named Goronwy: beekeeper, collector of honey, student of human nature. Everything Goronwy says reflects directly on the story unfolding around him. It's he who tells us that, just as an ugly pupa becomes a beautiful butterfly, so will Delta's hideous green baby become the new Chimeron queen. It's he who tells us that a newborn bee can become queen just by the right diet.  Those two sentences are the plot.  On the other hand, we also get two bumbling CIA agents. Contrary to Goronwy, absolutely nothing they say advances the story at all. In fact, the story stops dead whenever they're on screen. And that's ""Delta and the Bannermen"" for you. Sublime and the ridiculous aggressively sewn up in the same package.

This most small-scale ""Doctor Who"" story -- twelve black-clad soldiers menace a Welsh holiday camp in 1959 -- is also the most hyper and frenetic the show ever got. Here we have more spaceships and motorcycles and buses and cars and other vehicles all in one place for the first time since ""Planet of the Spiders"". If you thought all those Season 11 chase scenes were too much to handle, try this caper on for size -- and it's half the length!

The guest cast is variable. CIA agent Weismuller is played by Stubby Kaye, the New York-born Broadway star (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guys-and-Dolls/dp/0792844823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guys and Dolls</a>). Not only does he wear a Yankees jacket, but he wears the cap, too, just in case we missed the point. In 1959, the Yankees only finished in third place, and Kaye looks as tired and over the hill as Casey Stengel. But he's charming in the role and it's nice to add him to the ""Who"" legacy. His partner Hawk, on the other hand, has the worst American accents this side of ""Dalek"", and is played by someone named Morgan Deare who, if the Internet Movie Database is anything to go by, was most certainly not from New York.

The rest of ""Delta"" can be boiled down to vignettes that are interesting, and vignettes that are not. Ken Dodd's appearance has no impact for the American audience. Mel wears four different outfits, and that's just in the first thirty-five minutes.  Much better is the rock-and-roll themed incidental music, and would-be companion Ray, who's such a cute breath of fresh air. I love how she keeps explaining to everyone that Keillor, an ill-fated bounty hunter in blue suede shoes, was ""ionized"".

Sylvester McCoy is also terrific. You can tell they still weren't sure where to go with his Doctor yet -- witness all those misquotes (""A stitch in time fills up space!"" that were never again a staple of his character). And yet, he's gentle with Ray, and avuncular with Billy (""For a primitive piece of technology, it certainly delivers the decibels!""). His Part Two confrontation with the Bannermen leader Gavrok, staged on a rickety staircase, features great line after great line (a few minutes later, he's back to discussing honey with Goronwy).

The story wraps up about five minutes before the end of the final episode, leaving time for an extended denouement where all the (surviving) characters get something amusing to do. It ends with Goronwy telling us that, in the end, the new queen bee creates ""a new hive, and a new life"", and then he winks at the disappearing TARDIS.

The story's an episode shorter than most four-parters so there's more room on the DVD for vintage on-location footage; a nostalgic interview with British TV veteran Hugh Lloyd (Goronwy) taped shortly before the actor's death in 2008; and, from an ongoing 2-Entertain series, an overview of the 7th Doctor comic strip.  An excellent commentary track joins the Doctor and Ray with director Chris Clough and script editor Andrew Cartmel; there are solid anecdotes from all.  Also interesting is the original 30-minute edit of Part One, giving the story more room to breathe; this is untreated with visual or sound effects so a dinner gong is signified by a PA quietly saying: ""Dong!"".  Come to think of it, they could have left the ""Dong!"" in the finished product and the story wouldn't have suffered one bit.",1252886400,6,4196,4.894366197183099
3798829,3,B001UHO12U,"Yes, it's that bad.  Really bad.  It's got a busload of 50's rockers, leisure motorbiking through cow patties, mix of bad American accents, attacking punk rockers who drink too much cherry Kool-Aid, and screaming sirens of death.  If you like Ice Pirates, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Ed Wood or John Water's films, or cheese that is hot and sticky, then I definitely recommend this DVD.

Please don't make this your first Doctor Who purchase, this episode should only be reserved for older fans & drinking games.  It's crazy funny, I'm seriously laughing.  I'd only recommend this disc to those who love Mystery Science Theater 3000 jokes, too bad they didn't do this episode.  It's perfect.",1252368000,,690,4.947826086956522
3798830,1,B001UHO12U,"I guess the BBC is pacing itself on these DVD releases. There are still so many great Who stories waiting to come out but they continue to unleash dogs like this one and Timelash on us.  I suppose they don't want to be stuck putting out all of the howlers at the very end of the release schedule.
I like Sylvester McCoy and Colin Baker but they were ill-served by the producer and writers of  that era. Through no fault of his own, every story in McCoy's first season stunk.  His next season was much better and his final season was great. Stories like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Curse-of-Fenric-Episode-158/dp/B0001GF25G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric (Episode 158)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Remembrance-of-the-Daleks/dp/B00005Y6XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Remembrance of the Daleks</a>&nbsp;are classics.  If they had jumped directly to the quality of his final season the original Doctor Who might have lasted a while longer.
I won't even go into all of the reasons why Delta and the Bannermen is unwatchable.  Just stay away from it!
All of the worthwhile McCoy stories have been released (with the possible exception of The Greatest Show in the Galaxy) so the BBC should give his stuff a rest for a while. There are still a lot of great Pertwee and Tom Baker stories we need first.",1249084800,7,1466,5.8
3798831,3,B001UHO12U,"The year was 1987.  Forget about fictional Buck Rogers being frozen in time, to wake up 500 years later only to bad disco, spandex, scantily clad bimboids, some equally dim himbos, and of course that oddly shaped robot adored by children everywhere (it's a robot, how many kids DON'T like robots?)...  if real life involved Earth being nuked and was reborn with the mission to tell these ""advanced"" people about boogying, I'd want to commit suicide.  But that's another TV series, thankfully, so let's get back to ""Doctor Who""...

At the time, 1987, my local PBS affiliate aired the ""Doctor Who"" episodes.  I did not know that Colin Baker, my favorite Doctor at that point, was unceremoniously fired and replaced with Sylvester McCoy.  When ""Time and the Rani"" (the season premiere) aired, I thought ""Well, this is okay... looks great... a real drop in story quality...  hope things get better..."".

As this season, ""Doctor Who""'s 24th progressed, it quickly became apparent how my hope was misplaced.

""Delta and the Bannermen"" was the third of four stories to comprise the 24th season.  By this point, I was wondering why I was still watching.  The music was awful, the storylines had potential but were produced with as much pompous camp as could be shoved in...  apparently for comedic effect, as the BBC executives did not want horror or suspense as audiences deemed such scenes ""too graphic"".

And right down to the new Doctor's costume- the question mark pullover vest, umbrella, calling card...  ? symbols everywhere.  Yuck.  Just yuck.  The show's a self-aware pastiche of a parody.

But back to ""Delta and the Bannermen""; as further season 24 stories are released, I'll be more than happy to comment on them, and they aren't all as depressing as this story...

The story begins with some alien nasties tooting a horn and killing a bunch of people wearing green outfits.  Except Delta, who's obviously a white humanoid with a great set of thighs and bad hair.  (It WAS 1987...)  She manages to escape the clutches of Gavrok, leader of the Bannermen, intent on committing genocide and wiping her and her people, the Chimeron, off their planet for good.  (Sounds violent, doesn't it?)  She's chased to a galactic starport and climbs on board an alien tour agency, that plan to go to Disneyland.  The Doctor and Melanie arrive at the starport too.  The starport features a machine that changes beings from their native form into human form.  Don't worry, there are no relevant details to the process or for how long they remain in human form until they revert to their original form.  If you watch this story, you'll see why I refuse to describe what the aliens, the Navarinos, look like.  Unintentional or otherwise, it's gross.

*sigh*  They take off, with the Bannermen in pursuit.

Of course, the ship hits a satellite and crash-land in Wales.  No Disneyland for anybody today...

There are a couple of Americans who have been tracking the aforementioned satellite.  Just think ""horrendous stereotypes"" and don't be bothered.  Stubby Kaye guest-stars as one of these Americans.  A bit of a shame, that...

There's another lady of interest in this episode, Ray.  Her character was to replace Melanie as the companion.  Don't worry, that never happened.

There's yet another companion named Billy.  See, your typical chap from the 1950s, who sees a pretty woman giving strange food to a strange oddly-shaped baby thinks that, overhearing the exposition that eating this strange food will turn oddly-shaped babies into pretty girls, now believes that he will turn into an alien (but retain his pretty human male shape and function) by eating this magical food.

Do I really have to continue detailing this rubbish of a story?

Oh, very well:

Annoying Americans get their satellite.  Billy turns into an alien (but retains human form) and he, Delta, and the baby live happily ever after and repopulate the Chimeron species.  Oh, Mel's screams kill the Bannermen.  Ray stays behind to play with her motorcycle.  And the Navarinos...  well, I'm sure they went home and were more than happy to revert into their original gross appearance too.

I will say the story has a couple of bright spots:

* The 7th Doctor's true personality starts to appear
* At least the agony is only three episodes in length
* Keff McCulloch's recreations of 1950s-era music are done VERY well indeed (and the announcer in the story makes an obvious in-joke to this fact as well)
* The whole thing does have a 1950s whimsy feel to it -- if you like such a feel
* All of the actors play their roles seriously.  That really is a plus.  They let the viewer decide if it's campy or the best-ever episode or anything else
* The special effects are passable, but it's the star port set that took me by surprise - 22 years on, it still looks like money was put into it

Given the BBC's mandate to tone down horror and violence, it's amazing that a story centered around genocide even made it past their censors before heading into production.  The 50s-jovial attitude of the production, combined with incidental music that, when not recreating 1950s songs, helps shroud the grim concept.  But made another way, with more grit and fewer scenes featuring dumb people doing really dumb things that make zero sense, it otherwise would have escaped the holder of ""Worst episode ever"".

This story is either loved or loathed by fans.  I obviously loathe it.  It's silly, tacky, pretentious, serious ideas let down by a pantomime, self-parody of a feel to the proceedings (again, at least the actors play it straight -- if they broke the 4th wall with antics, it'd make this story 0 stars at best).  It deserved to be so much more.

For the technical side, DVD compression is good, as usual, for a WHO release, and the video and sound quality are very good indeed.  Excellent remastering, as usual.  More TV shows deserve the same level of treatment and care.

And now to answer the question you're all thinking of:  The reason why I gave it more than one star is because of the amount and quality of included extras - including an original 30 minute edit of part one, archive interviews, a great commentary, and some outtakes.  And more.  The extras alone make this DVD worth a purchase, even for the most ardent fans who otherwise loathe this scribble of a story.

And, indeed, ignore the gaffes in the story's logic, campy tone of the incidental music (save for the 1950s songs, which were very well realized), and just roll along with it with ZERO expectations, I can see why some people love this story.  There is an atmosphere of ""fun"" to it.  It's garbage, but it's fun garbage.  At least for those who can find the fun in it.

Oh, an epilogue:  Fortunately, the story that followed ""Delta and the Bannermen"", known as ""Dragonfire"", was a decent improvement, with the 25th season showing the show had plenty of life left in it.  But that's a discussion for another time...",1248739200,6,6947,4.77563025210084
3798832,1,B001UHO12U,"I grew up watching Dr. Who.  There isn't a Doctor that I didn't like--no LOVE.  Until....until McCoy.  I tried so hard to like him, but episodes like this made me loathe the man, and where he took the series.  This may be the worst episode of Dr. Who I have ever seen.  There is nothing redeeming about this one.  I own the entire Who series, and I am passing on this, because the thought of having to endure this episode again causes me physical pain",1248393600,8,451,4.247058823529412
3798833,5,B001UHO12U,"This show set in a 1950's british summer tourest camp is just that camp, yet a lot of fun. It poles fun at every aspect of everyday life of the 1950's, and keeps everyone smiling from the start to end.

3798834,4,B001UHO12U,"I'm one of those people who love Delta and the Bannerman.  Yes there are sappy parts, but they are more than made up for by the good parts. The beginning with the purple aliens and the bus ride..not so good. Everything at the summer camp, Mel, Delta, Ray, Billie & the Bee-Keeper are all good. The actual Bannermen are horrible. The investigators, the navarino's and the background music is what gives this episode a bad name. So if you want to see an episode where the doctor dances to 50's music and rides a motorcycle, Mel is tolerable, and the doctor plays eccentric with a real eccentric, please join in. It has a different flavor than any other 7th doctor episode. If you are looking for a tight, action_packed story you probably need to move along.

The BBC is known to do the best period pieces and Doctor Who is no exception.  Now this takes place in 1959.  Not a time I was around for but the feel of the story went with the era I thought.  Trying to pull off 50's style rock with 80's synthesizers was a bit of a challenge but it was passable.  What I really liked about this story was the pacing of it.  The story moved right along from the opening action sequences.  It felt like the story never let up from beginning to end.  Is this one of the best written Doctor Whos of all time?  Absolutely not.  Is this a fun adventure the keeps moving forward from beginning to end?  Definitely!  I think the story also being only 3 parts helped make the action move a lot quicker than most other stories.

The acting is bad, the story doesn't work, the premise is ridiculous, Mel is at her worst, the bad guys make no sense, the supporting cast are totally shallow and make bizarre decisions, and worst of all it revolves around the 80s obsession with the 50s.

3798853,4,B001UHO12U,"Season 24 is a misstep, yes. Time and the Rani is a little too goofy and has too many odd script points; Paradise Towers was literally not even directed and had some really corny acting and music; Dragonfire was cheesy and rather irksome at times. Delta and the Bannermen though, now that was a good episode. Not perfect by any stretch but good. Sylvester McCoy starts to fit into the role much better (though he won't be in his best until Remembrance of the Daleks onwards) and even Mel isn't so annoying in this story. And there's quite a lot to enjoy here, from special features to the main story.

The tale is simple. The last survivor of her race, Delta the Chimeron Queen escapes her planet as the nasty and hostile Bannermen, led by Gavrok, kill her people. She escapes with an egg and hitches aboard a party bus that the Doctor and Mel have boarded, heading to Disneyland in 1959. After being hit by a satellite, the bus goes off course to Shangri-La, a holiday camp and the group decides to party it up in Wales. The Bannermen however come to crash the party and kill Delta and her newborn girl.

It's decidedly more upbeat and different than a usual Who affair and it is quite different from say a darker tale like Vengeance on Varos or Frontios. But what's wrong with some good old fashioned fun once in a while? And Delta was shot on location so it looks good, and really feels like we're in Wales in the 50s. The characters are quite a character bunch, and not all of them get quite as much to do as others in this rather short story (only 3 parts!) and the cliffhangers aren't really all the great (they work though). Ray comes off to me as a bit annoying and her Welsh accent is irritating to me as well. The boyfriend is so shallow as well, it was hard to like him or care about him. Delta is well acted though and Gavrok is actually a good villain.

I wished we'd learn more about the Chimerons and the Bannermen and why they were in war but hey, what we get is a fun, cozy, summer night family-time adventure that works despite some weak and shaky parts. Season 24 wasn't without its faults but it wasn't without its merits too, and Delta and the Bannermen is certainly one of those. Don't take too seriously, and you'll be laughing and rocking along with the 7th Doctor and Mel all the way!

A little added history.  That's a Brand new Vincent Black Shadow Ray is Riding and here is why its so special.

The Vincent-HRD Owners Club is a non-profit-making club dedicated to preserving the heritage of the Vincent marque. Not only does it run a very competent and successful club consisting of archivists, engineers, owners, machine registrar, boffins etc., it also has ties with The VOC Spares Company Ltd. This associate company deals purely in spares for Vincent-HRD machines and, together with the club, an idea was formed to build a complete bike to ensure the quality of its spares and to see whether or not every part was available. It also happened to be the next stage up from when the club successfully built a complete new engine in 2004.

The model of the bike was decided  C-model circa 1949-54  and the plans from 2005 were put into action in early 2006.
The project wasn't easy. While most of the spares are common replacement parts (not copies but made to original dimensions and spec) to fit on existing chassis, a new machine meant building a new upper frame member (the headstock and main spar that also held the engine oil from which the engine attaches/hangs from) and rear frame member (the subframe). There was also the matter of producing the Girdraulic forks to the original exacting standards  in the end the forks were machined from solid so are stronger than the originals although you couldn't tell them apart. The building problems didn't end there. As the clubs information officer Paul Adams says: Where we didn't have the original factory engineering drawings to make parts, we had to measure exactly original components and present them as new drawings to the engineering companies we used. If these parts were quantity ordered theyd be fairly cheap, but the initial outlay would be huge. In effect the parts we had made are bespoke and that sort of quality costs money.

WHATS SO SPECIAL ABOUT VINCENT BLACK SHADOWS?

They were deigned by Brits, built by Brits and ridden by just about everybody, and still are. The fact that it was fast for its day, handled as good as any 1970s Japanese bike and was full of technical goodness says it all. I mean, what other bikes do you know where thumbwheels are used to adjust the chain so easily and T-bar-type QD wheel spindle removal is standard? Everything about the bike is adjustable, thats internal and external, it has left and right side stands that adapt to be a front wheel lift, and theres a main stand. Adjustable rear damping and steering damper, too. To top it off theres a removable metal tool tray under the seat. And that Sidecar is a wonderful option. To sum up the Vincent Black shadow: the bollocks.",1471478400,,3155,4.822222222222222

8343757,2,B001UHO12U,"This story has a good premise at its core with a time travelling tour bus that crash lands in Wales instead of its intended destination of Disneyworld. The Doctor turns in a decent performance (except for one of the weakest ""Doctor speeches"" in show history but I think that's a result of the writing.) I also find Mel to be a lovely person who just happens to have an annoying habit of screaming all the time. The 1950s music when it played or sung was very nice and there were some good scenes of the Welsh countryside. I liked the idea of quick growing aliens, though here it's done a bit too quickly. I also appreciated an authority figure reacting sensibly to an alien visit.

The story really falls down in execution. The characters of Hawk and Weisuller take up several scenes and are actually rather pointless to the plot. And as to their actual effect on the story, to put it nicely, well let's say, they're not exactly Jago and Litefoot. The resolution to both cliffhangers was really weak, though if it helps the cliffhangers weren't all that great either. The villains look absurb with their visor sunglasses and overall are surprisingly weak. The plot is contrived. And the incidental music is really bad throughout, particularly in battle scenes.

I could see this story as being ""so bad it's good,"" and that sort of rating is interpretative. All Delta and the Bannerman was missing was commentary by the crew of MST3K.  I can't really see it as comedy in the Douglas Adams style of Pirate Planet or City of Death. There's daftly executed parody and then there's a poorly executed story that can pick a tone and uses poor music. In the end, the story is another off-7th Doctor Tale from Season 24.",1429920000,,1711,4.621710526315789
8343758,4,B001UHO12U,Kinda fun story based during the 1950's and a certain Russian moment in space history. Weak villains thou!,1429488000,,106,4.944444444444445
8343759,5,B001UHO12U,"I have no idea why, but this is probably my favorite Sylvestet McCoy episode, at least of the ones with Mel.  It's good, and there's so so much going on in the background we don't know about for sure but can guess all over the place. I adore it.",1426464000,,245,4.0
