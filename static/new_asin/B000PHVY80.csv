8191800,5,B000PHVY80,"A little unfair for me to review... I worked on this film, UPM.  This is NOT your daddy's western.  Have an open mind and accept this quirky movie as a look at what a drug cartel might have been like in the 1800s.  (Filmed in historical cabins now located in Fernland Historical Park, in Montgomery, TX.",1519603200,,303,4.375
8191801,1,B000PHVY80,Another non-anamorphic widescreen transfer in 2007!!. Haven't come across Inspired Pictures before and with such a lazy transfer I don't won't to see any more of their DVD releases.,1497052800,,181,5.275862068965517
8191802,4,B000PHVY80,"I enjoyed it. It went from funny to tense to poignant. A friend recommend it. Hadn't heard of it, but found it on amazon. Worth a watch. Even watched it a second time already.",1346198400,,175,4.176470588235294
8191803,1,B000PHVY80,"I have a large collection of DVD movies.  I threw this one away directly after my first viewing, not wishing it to fall into the hands of anyone who might waste their time as I had.  I can't even tell you what it was about, it was so not good to be remembered.",1240012800,,260,3.8867924528301887
8191804,4,B000PHVY80,Loved it.  I just love Westerns and this was one of the best I've seen in a while.  Good acting and just loved the old fat guy.  Lots of blood and fighting...my 8 year old will love it!,1217894400,2,185,3.8157894736842106
8191805,5,B000PHVY80,"This is a refreshing new western with an interesting twist at the end.
