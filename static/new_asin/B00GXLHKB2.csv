8628474,3,B00GXLHKB2,"I have other DVDs on the ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" and this collection of eleven films is a fine DVD, although I felt that some of these films have become outdated. Remember, some of these films were produced in the late 30s and early 40s by the director Frank Capra and used as training films in military camps during World War II. I don't remember seeing any interviews conducted with soldiers or journalist/writers who covered World War II, but it is still a fine collection for any World War II enthusiast.",1394323200,,519,4.531914893617022
