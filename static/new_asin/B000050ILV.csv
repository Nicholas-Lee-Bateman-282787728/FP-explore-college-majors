7929121,5,B000050ILV,"Despite the campy dubbing, cheap effects and the dollar store props, this movie still features excellent Kung Fu, solid acting (with a cast made up of true professionals that takes their roles seriously) and a story line about human loss and suffering, that for some reason I can really sympathize with. In the end, I couldn't help but feel sorrow for Joey, who lost everything he held dear in his life and had to sell his soul just to get revenge. Sure the dubbing is pretty ridiculous at times and the main characters names being westernized into Gary and Joey (I don't know why) is kind of silly, but it ads a certain funny campiness to the story that I thoroughly enjoyed. The scene where Joey falls into hell and meets ""the prince of darkness"" had me coughing out my drink with laughter and the nine demons with their ""babysitter"" are equally comical, while at the same time vicious (Imagine if you were randomly attacked by demon children drying to drink your blood and tear you to shreds) In fact everytime the characters would say ""Joey the DEMON"" I couldn't help but get a good laugh out of it. You can't take a movie like this too seriously, just watch it and have fun and enjoy it for what it is. For those reviewers saying that this is the WORSE Kung Fu movie they've ever seen, that's just ridiculous, because they obviously have not seen close to as many Kung Fu flicks as I have. Say what you want about this film, but at least the acting in on point and the story flows smoothly in a linear fashion. Sure there's no CGI and obviously they were working with a limited budget, but CGI doesn't make a movie, in fact these days there are far too many big hollywood blockbusters that are CGI infested and end up being terrible movies. At least this features some great kung fu, some campy fun times and a heart felt story about human loss and suffering that everyone can relate to. NOTE: I would love to get my hands on a dvd that features subtitles so I could see the real dialog, not just whatever was improvised and most importantly I want to know what the hell the real names of the two main characters are, obviously not Joey and Gary and Johnson's estate... lol",1511481600,,2178,4.433915211970075
7929122,2,B000050ILV,"Most of the reviews on here have pretty much captured it: this film kinda STUNK. I am mainly writing to let folks in on a bit of info that I have only recently learned about this film. As I understand it, from a reliable source from which I procure martial arts films, this film was not actually a ""Shaw Brothers"" film. My understanding is that it was one of those films that came out just as Shaw Studios was dissolving and many of their actors, particularly the Venoms Mob, were finding work at other studios such as Ocean Shores (though I cannot fathom what studio actually put Nine Demons together; I had always thought it was Shaw until recently.) This film is like NINJA IN THE DEADLY TRAP in that it features some of the Venoms, and was thought by many to be a Shaw Brothers film. In addition to a couple of the Venoms, this film also features the protagonist that old school kung-fu fans will recognize from FIVE ELEMENT NINJAS (Chinese Super Ninjas).

What REALLY causes this film to suffer is the shoddy production. The only copy that seems to have been floating around in the U.S. is a faded, slightly blurred copy with a crappy full-screen view, which wreaks havok with the battle sequences throughout the film. A nice clean remastered letterboxed version would seriously upgrade this dog of a flick. Several of the crucial battle sequences take place offscreen due to the full-screen cropping. It makes a film that is already preposterous and ridiculous appear even choppier and sloppier.

If you are a hardcore fan of the Shaw stars, then spend your lunch money and check it out just to make yourself aware of it's presence, but this is definitely not a keeper, at least not unless someone puts out a clean letterboxed, remastered version.",1387411200,,1753,4.669902912621359
7929123,1,B000050ILV,"This movie is the worst I have seen from the great director Cheh Chang. This movie has it all funky disco lights, vampire kids. I guess every great director is entitled to a stinker or two. I kind of liked the movie in till the end. And that's what killed the movie. And to make it worst the lead of the movie  name is Joey. Joey in a Chinese movie seemed kind of silly. This movie is more watch able if you had a few drinks.",1133481600,,425,3.941860465116279
7929124,4,B000050ILV,"From beginning to end this movie is hands down one of the most insane kung fu movies I've ever seen.  Much more akin to films like ""Versus"" than ""The Five Deadly Venoms,"" this film has everything but the proverbial kitchen sink thrown into it.  On the surface it's a pretty standard revenge film - father gets murdered, son goes on rampage - but that is only the skeleton on which the true substance of this crazy, horror, kung fu fest takes flesh.  Wild kung fu/wire fu fights, demonic vampire child acrobats, flying blood sucking skulls, the devil, a guillotine, a whore with a heart of gold, exploding bodies, romance, intrigue, sacrifice, tests of loyalty, betrayal, forgiveness, an exorcism, and even a moral - you should never kill anyone...unless they're really bad, and even then don't do it with powers you got from making a deal with the devil - all go into making this film the treat that it is.

If, like me, you love your kung fu movies for more than just the fighting...if you like them just a bit over the top (or a lot over the top)...and if you aren't a kung fu snob, then this movie is for you!",1093737600,5,1112,4.463054187192118
7929125,1,B000050ILV,"Please be aware that this film is a complete waste of both your time and money.  I was trying to be subjective but I cant bring myself to mislead a true kung-fu fan, especially a fan of the ""Venoms"" troupe.  The film in short is about a guy whose father was killed, gets magical powers from the devil, and then takes revenge. Pretty common theme other than the magical powers,silly gorish effects,and the incoherent plot. Complete waste !!!!!!!!!",1076889600,2,446,4.705128205128205
7929126,1,B000050ILV,"Please, never buy this movie from anyone at any price! It actually hurt to try and sit through this one. It has to be one of the top 10 worst kung-fu movies ever made. I really should not have given it the one star. This is shameful stuff. And I actually like the main actor in other movies. But this is just nasty. -7 stars.",1018224000,5,325,4.015384615384615
7929127,1,B000050ILV,"Please do not be fooled into thinking that this is a ""Venoms"" flick. This is a terrible labeling error. It has Chang Shieng and Lu Feng, but it is not worthy of being anywhere in the same class as ""Five Deadly Venoms"" or either ""Flag of Iron"" for that matter. Please, do not be tricked into buying into this garbage of a movie. It tried to come off as a horror-tinged kung fu flick, but it is a total waste of time. I love all of the Venoms and there movies, but I think that they are trying to pull one over on us here. Why couldn't they release ""Masked Avengers"" instead? I don't even think they should bill it as a venoms flick unless it has at least three if the originals in it. This one has only two!!! It was painful to sit through this movie... What a waste of money!!!",1001894400,5,777,4.084967320261438
7929128,4,B000050ILV,"There are some very excellent things about this film, and some very annoying things.  Let me start with the annoying things.  The title of the film in the opening credits is actually ""The 9 Venoms."" (Why do they say that?)  Also the stars of the movie are given in the opening credits in Chinese characters only (no English credits), so its difficult to know which Venoms are actually in the movie and which are not.  The box does not help.  It too lists only ""The Venoms"" (maybe they can't read Chinese either?) I count at least two Venoms here, Chiang Sheng and Lu Feng, and a large ensemble of Venom-looking guys who actually can pass.  Lu Feng has only a cameo as the Prince of Hell.  The film features a heavy dose of the supernatural, and all supernatural kung fu films of this period have the tackiest of special effects.  The film is in full screen, and if there was ever a film that needed to be presented in glorious ""ShawScope"" or widescreen, it is this one. The ""scanning"" is unforgiveable (there is little if any ""panning"") and key fighters in key battles just drift out of frame and back into frame.  The voice talent is not the Shaw Brothers dub core we've come to expect.  THAT audio must have been lost or something, or unsalvageable, because this audio track has ""modern"" dubbing with unfamiliar voices.  If that wasn't a distraction enough, the characters are now ""Joey...Gary...Roland."" (Do you really want to hear that?)
Now for the good things.  If you can look beyond the above distractions, there is some excellent Venom-style fighting here.  Forget for a moment that these guys are not the REAL Venoms.  They LOOK like Venoms, and have that period slicked-down hairstyle we like in our Venom movies.  The film is directed by long-standing Venom director Chang Cheh, and the fights are up to his standards.  The fights include that signature ""Venom strike"" blow sound when they strike each other, and, I'm sorry, but when you hear long awesome fights with that strike sound, it can become hypnotic, and you forget all about the film's other shortcomings.",991094400,5,2078,4.714681440443213
7929129,3,B000050ILV,"The venoms star in a film involving one man and his need for revenge.  After missing death by the narrowist of margins he is offerd help by a demon, who wants his soul in return.  driven by hatred he accepts his offer, and begins his blood drive with the help of the 9 demons.  Very strange film, some amazing imaginative scenes, with some great fight scenes.  A lot more talk then fighting wich may be the only down aspect.",978220800,2,424,4.329113924050633
