1351082,4,B00004TJK5,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying!  My daughter loves this DVD, especially the Three Little Pigs episode.  However, it does not play continuously.  We play DVDs in our van on car trips and it is annoying that it goes back to the menu after each episode. That is the only reason I dislike it.",1151366400,2,310,4.310344827586207
1351083,5,B00004TJK5,"We got this video as a gift and right away my son became glued to it.  This was his first Dragon Tale's video and since then we had to buy others.  I like this and all the Dragon Tale videos, they are very innocent and sweet and there's always a lesson to be learned in each one.  Most of all my son and his cousin's love them, and have been doing much better about sharing because of it.  A must have video!",1119916800,,408,3.9390243902439024
1351084,4,B00004TJK5,"My kids love this DVD, the only complaint I have is that the 5 different stories don't play continuously, we have to play each one separately",1093392000,5,141,4.461538461538462
1351085,4,B00004TJK5,"Well, Despite the not-too-promising title (Ugh! I hate Barney!) and the fact that at all the stories on the disc has at least one nursery rhyme or nursery rhyme parody, the disc does have it's high points as well. Like when Ord drinks up the milk in Kiki's milk bottle, then plays innocent. Or Cassie puckering up her lips due to frustration in ""Bad Share Day"". Pick it up if you're a Dragon Tales hardcore (like me), or if you think you can stomach the nursery rhymes and nursery rhyme parodies. Otherwise, you're better off with ""You Can Do It"".",1022976000,,547,4.48
1351086,5,B00004TJK5,"Entertaining. Story is perfect for this audience. Emphasizes friendship and teamwork.  Teaches kids to see and understand simple concepts. No one is judged whether he or she is a human or dragon. They're all friends. The kids enjoyed the stories and the dancing. ""My friends will love the magic crayon just like me."" ""I like to see Ord. He is so silly."" ""The dragons and the kids all treated each other so nice."" ""All the girls will like this. The boys won't like it so much.""  Ages 2-5.",1000339200,2,487,4.5227272727272725

1351098,4,B00004TJK5,Fast shipping.  However this DVD only plays one cartoon at a time.  It doesn't just play all of them.  After each One you gotta pick another one to play.  Very annoying.,1444867200,,169,4.354838709677419
1351099,1,B00004TJK5,"As I watched this show, I thought a little bit about Dragon Tales becoming a great TV show like Little Bear. Sadly, Dragon Tales becomes an animated TV show that's no where near as good as Little Bear at all. Little Bear was just amazing with the animal characters, animation, and the little girl, Emily. Dragon Tales had some music that was similar to the music in Little Bear which I thought was very good. Little bear was full of amazing stories about friendships, solving problems, and using your imagination. But with Dragon Tales, this show was full of boring stories, characters, songs, and it's slightly serious and contrived at times. How about you watch Little Bear and don't even think about coming near this show!",1430352000,,725,4.761904761904762
1351100,1,B00004TJK5,"The movie came in great condition and on time. My kids all love the show.  I am only giving one star for this reason; the disc does not have a ""Play All"" or ""Continuous Play"" option, which is very annoying. Like another commenter stated, I bought this specifically for car rides (she could watch free on NetFlix at home!) and it's frustrating to have to manually select the next episode and hit play after every ten minute video. It doesn't even automatically highlight the next one, so you have to manually skip over the ones she already watched to find the track you want to play, especially while driving! Thankfully my van has a DVD player built in, but if my toddler were using a handheld one that she had to work herself it would be impossible (unless you want to pull over to help them every 10 minutes). Do not plan on putting it on while you cook dinner or do other household chores, because you will have to stop what you're doing to constantly change episodes.

I bought several Dragon Tales DVD's and this is the only one I have seen with this problem. I recommend purchasing a different video.",1426636800,2,1106,4.47029702970297

1351103,5,B00004TJK5,"All the Dragon Tales videos have been a hit with my daughter. She likes the characters and she can relate to the stories. She really enjoyed them when she was younger 3 1/2 to 4 1/2, though she does watch them every now and again.",1365465600,,230,4.133333333333334
1351104,5,B00004TJK5,"this product came quickly and packaged well.  it's not a movie, rather several eposodes on one dvd.  just select ""play all"" and the kids don't know the difference",1364428800,,162,4.75
1351105,5,B00004TJK5,"My grandson is 2yrs old and is at the age where only certain cartoons catch his attention, this is one of them. Dragon tales is cute, colorful and full of imagination. Unlike alot of the cartoons out there now where there is hitting and fighting in them. Dragontales is sweet and teaches the children to play and share. I will continue to let my granson watch them and my grandaughter is next in line.",1259798400,,401,4.4324324324324325
1351106,5,B00004TJK5,"I love this DVD because it has five full episodes and it's great learning entertainment for my toddler. He already knows the Dragon Tales song by heart! It's family entertainment and I rarely have the TV on regular programming anymore because I'm always afraid there's going to be some violent scene popping up.

Every episode has a lesson and my son really loves it. It's age appropriate for children 3 or older, I would say. A great choice with nice episode selection!
