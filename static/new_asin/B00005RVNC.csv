7953017,5,B00005RVNC,"This movie is hilarious! However, I think you have to be German, or have grown up there to really get the jokes.",1323216000,4,112,4.136363636363637
7953018,4,B00005RVNC,"Like wines, some comedies just don't travel: most German comedies shouldn't even make the effort. Having sat through (or tried to) a few German comedies in the past that were so parochial as to be completely mystifying to anyone outside that country's borders (not to mention painfully unfunny in the loudest possible way), the last thing I ever expected to ever be able to recommend was a German comedy, but Manitou's Shoe (in it's 'Extra Large' version at least) is hysterically funny for at least 75 minutes of its running time.

You don't have to have seen the Winnetou films to get most of the jokes - pitched somewhere between vintage Zucker and Abrahams with a pinch of classic Mel Brooks. Indeed, it may even help that audiences outside Germany are not familiar with Bully Herbig's TV work: the repetition of TV sketches that so many German viewers have complained about really isn't an issue for us foreigners.

Like most comedies, it runs out of steam towards the end when the need to wrap up the plot (such as it is) takes over, but for much of its running time it throws in some breathtakingly absurd and unexpected jokes, all the funnier for being delivered straight (special kudos here to Sky Dumont as Santa Maria, who subverts audience expectations to brilliant effect). There are a few jokes and characters that fall flat, most notably a Greek Apache who has nothing funny to say or do, but there are so many laugh-out-loud-even-when-you're-on-your-own moments here that you can forgive them.

Also worth noting is the fact that, unlike most comedies (especially ones with their origins in television), Manitou looks like a real film: well directed with a good use of the Scope frame and a genuine sense of scale. One word of warning for non-German speakers - avoid the dubbed version of the original cut, which appears to have been dubbed by many of the original cast who think their English/America accents are a lot better than they actually are (a major factor in the film not being released in English-speaking territories despite its massive local success). The 'Extra Large' version has a different American voice cast, and a very good one too - the voices sound right for the characters for a change.

Bottom line, it's not big, it's not clever, but it is funny.",1178409600,5,2287,4.7969543147208125
7953019,5,B00005RVNC,"One of the best German farces, ridiculously funny. It's our sons' favorite movie, their mother hates it because she grew up reading Karl May books (German analog of James Fennimore Cooper) and takes them seriously. The movie is, of course, a farce based on a May story. The scene where Santa Maria dances is worth the whole show, as is the end where one discovers the origin of 'Think Pink' .... .

Maybe second best German farce: Vaya con Dios with Chiara Schoras, but it's unavailable in the U.S.",1172880000,6,498,4.595505617977528
7953020,5,B00005RVNC,"Extra Funny, however when viewing in 'English' I cannot get English subtitles in the few places that they are shown and much to my Mothers (R.I.P) disgust my German is terrible.",1172016000,,177,4.741935483870968
7953021,5,B00005RVNC,I don't understand why this product isn't available in US format. I would absolutely buy it. I saw the movie in Germany and laughed tears during the show.,1164758400,6,154,4.535714285714286
7953022,5,B00005RVNC,"Who would have thought that germans can make such great Cinema... Of course, some jokes are only funny if you know a little about the german culture, and the old Karl May Winnetou cowboy and indians books... but even if you dont, it is as amusing as any Mel Brooks movie",1140739200,4,270,4.313725490196078
7953023,5,B00005RVNC,"This movie is just... hilarious! Michael Herbig created a movie that keeps you laughing. You just cannot stop. I've seen it 30 times and still it makes me laugh over and over again. I mean, the horse that's always throwing up when running too fast... C'mon, this movie just shows german humour at its best... I wonder who said german's aren't funny?!? Let me as a german tell you: German humour is underestimated by far too many people! Watch this movie and you'll know how funny we can really be!!

By the way Michael Herbig had a comedy show( Bullyparade)on TV and as far as I know you can purchase it on DVD... It's worth watching it. You're gonna die laughing!!! Enjoy the real german humour...",1138147200,4,698,4.5396825396825395
7953024,5,B00005RVNC,"who says germans don't have a sense of humour?  this was one of the funniest things i have ever seen.  slapstick, genuine one liners, and perfectly edited and dialogued situations, its pure genius.  the part where Ranger gets 'pulled over' by the sherrif on his horse, and gets asked whether he has 'hotted this horse up' cracked me up.  very steve martin-ish, only much, MUCH better.

gold, get it when its available.
