7433660,5,B015EULBOE,"There are two sections. One for younger kids, and one for older kids. BOTH are super fun and enjoyed by my kids.
I used the older kids video in class (4th grade) as part of an Empathy awareness and the students loved all of it - it also stop right there the competition for the ""I have the scariest/rarest food allergy"" contest within the classroom.

Kyle is the best in real life - but for all those who cannot see him live, the DVD is a nice, well rounded, fun, educational, medically accurate replacement.",1448150400,2,508,4.404255319148936

7433666,5,B015EULBOE,"Kyle Dine rocks! He did a fabulous job with this video and we greatly appreciate all he has done for the allergy community! This video was nice that it covered allergy awareness for two different groups. As a Mother of a child with severe food allergies and a volunteer at an elementary school, I have to say this is one of the best tools out there to help educate students. Highly recommend it!",1448150400,3,395,4.424657534246576

7433668,5,B015EULBOE,"What a fun way to help students understand food allergies, either their own food allergies, or why the allergic kids in their class have be so careful. Kyle Dine really connects with kids, and he knows their concerns because he's grown up with food allergies himself.",1448150400,4,267,4.826086956521739
7433669,5,B015EULBOE,"Kyle Dine is an incredible role model!  The Anaphylaxis Communtiy is fortunate to have such an inspiring and talented ambassador.  Although he delivers a life-saving message supporting individuals with anaphylaxis, Kyle's work engages everyone!  This DVD is a 'must buy' for schools, youth clubs and day-cares.  Even students without food allergies will be enchanted with Kyle Dine's upbeat and entertaining delivery.",1448150400,4,417,5.786885245901639

7433671,5,B015EULBOE,"Kyle Dine & Friends is the BEST WAY to educate children about Food Allergies in a fun way... that doesn't feel like a ""lesson""! We had the privilege of having our son participate in this DVD, but we were backers long before that, as we believed in Kyle's mission to educate. The Food Allergy Community NEEDED something like this for our children and it should be in every school and shown yearly. It will bring understanding, compassion and will help others know what to do when someone suffers a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). You can't go wrong with this video! Buy one today for yourself and share one with your elementary school. It's a 2 disk set with 1 DVD targeted to children in K to 2nd grade and the 2nd one targeted to those in 3rd to 6th grade. (Attached are some behind the scenes photos from the filming of the video, my son Jayden is in the teal polo with the guitar... rocking to Food Allergies Rock!)",1446854400,4,926,4.485207100591716
7433672,5,B015EULBOE,"Kyle Dine is an incredibly talented and extremely creative children's entertainer.  He also wields the utmost authority on living life while coping with food allergies as he has multiple food allergies himself and is a successful world-traveled musical educator.

These expertly crafted videos are full of incredibly fun and catchy age-appropriate songs and lessons about having food allergies.  How to avoid your trigger foods, hand washing, always carrying your auto-injector, and how to quickly reach out for help if necessary are just some of the topics not only touched upon but driven home by Kyle and his puppet friends.

As an adult with a severe food allergy I am so glad that this type of resource is available for the ever-growing club of the food allergic.  As a parent of a child with food allergies, this is an invaluable tool to help teach a toddler turning into a pre-schooler about the importance of not eating food unless its OKd by mommy or daddy, and for her to let us know immediately if she is having a reaction.  Luckily she loves to wash her hands, so we've got that covered.  These lessons are delivered in the fine tradition of children's programming like Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers, and they work.  Both of my kids were moving to the music upon our first viewing!

I not only recommend this for food allergy families, but I would say that extended family who may not understand food allergies, your child's friends and their parents, and organizations like schools, churches, camps, & clubs could all benefit from the knowledge and entertainment provided by this set of DVDs.  This programming ought to play on constant rotation in your family's pediatric allergists office waiting room.

This can and will serve as an incredibly fun way to open the door to creating a fun, safe, and confident approach to living with food allergies.",1446768000,5,1861,4.876190476190477
7433673,5,B015EULBOE,"I hope that every primary school in Australia invests in this wonderful DVD for the welfare and safety of their students.  My twin boys, Matthew and Harry, love this DVD and love every single section and song.  They already know all the words, but the most important thing is they now have the confidence and words to live with their multiple allergies and communicate them to others.  Thank you Kyle Dine.",1446768000,5,406,4.690140845070423
7433674,5,B015EULBOE,"Wonderful resource for schools and really any group of kids to raise awareness, educate and overall support friends, classmates or teammates dealing with food allergies.",1446681600,3,169,5.8
7433675,5,B015EULBOE,"This DVD isn't just for children who have food allergies but their families and friends as well  Schools in my area are loving having this tool to help teach children about food allergies and how to be a good friend to someone with food allergies.  I believe everyone (even adults) can learn from the DVD.  Kyle uses catchy tunes, puppets and some adorable friends to help teach important lessons.

Having 2 DVDs, specific to a child's age and understanding, is fantastic too.  This would be a great purchase for schools, libraries, families and friends who know (and love) someone who has food allergies.",1446681600,6,605,4.834951456310679
7433676,5,B015EULBOE,Kyle is a hero on our street.  I would highly recommend his work to help people learn to live with allergies and spread awareness!,1446681600,2,130,4.416666666666667

7433678,5,B015EULBOE,"This is an amazing resource for schools.  Kyle uses his upbeat & catchy music along with his hilarious puppets to create an edutainment DVD.  There are 2 DVD's in the set.  Each is geared toward a specific age group to ensure that the children get age appropriate information.  Each is filled with fun, music, and education.  This set is perfect for the classroom setting.

I think my favorite part is watching the glitter experiment.  All kids love glitter.  Kyle uses glitter to represent peanut proteins and demonstrates how easy it is to transfer the proteins & contaminate an area.  He also shows how using hand sanitizer doesn't remove the proteins but then shows how easy soap & water can.

My girls sang and danced along to his songs and vocally played along with his ""Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down"" game. They laughed until they were red in the face and were learning a very important lesson at the same time.

Kyle talks about the improtance the message of never keeping a reaction a secret which is a vital message for kids to learn.  Some kids are shy, some are afraid to speak up, and some are told their symptoms are no big deal.  This empowers kids to recognize their symptoms and to speak up.

This is truly an amazing resource for any classroom.  Purchasing this DVD was one of the best investments I've made.",1446681600,7,1319,4.600858369098712

I highly recommend it for anyone who has food allergies or cares about someone with food allergies (especially schools!).,1446681600,5,268,4.604166666666667
7433681,5,B015EULBOE,"This is the best allergy awareness video. It is fun and super educational. I sent it to school with my first grader to show in her class, it was a huge hit! The school nurse plans on showing it to all of the grades. I love how Kyle Dine made 2 discs so it can be age appropriate learning. We had Kyle Dine come to the school to do an assembly last year which was super fun and educational for the whole school. This video is a great alternative and more affordable for schools that can't have the live version. I love to see the impact it has on the children who have seen this. My daughter who has severe food allergies feels so included and almost famous in her class now!",1446681600,6,674,4.113636363636363

8733320,5,B015EULBOE,"Both my children (2 and 4) have multiple severe food allergies, and I am always trying to find kid friendly ways to educate them about the severity of their situation while still trying to maintain a sense of fun and light hearted-ness.  They love Kyle's video, and my oldest loves to sing along to the songs (who knew singing about cross contamination could be so fun?!).  It's helped give them additional ways to talk about their food allergies to friends and others.  We've showed the videos to their friends as well as a way to help them understand how to keep each other safe.  Though we're not school age yet, I bought an extra video to give to their future school as I know it will be a great resource for them.  Thanks to Kyle for putting together a stellar DVD and for being such a wonderful advocate for the food allergy community!",1448236800,,841,4.470588235294118
