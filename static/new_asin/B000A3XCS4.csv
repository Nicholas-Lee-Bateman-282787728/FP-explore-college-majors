8074213,5,B000A3XCS4,"""Hill Street Blues"" was a pivotal show in television history, not only because it brought a flinty-realism in terms of both the style and substance of the program, but because it proved that a show could survive despite low Nielsen ratings as long as people with large amounts of disposable income were the ones doing the watching. Created by Stephen Bochco and Michael Kozoll, ""Hill Street Blues"" used cinematic techniques associated with the films of Robert Altman (""M*A*S*H"") with an unusual mixture of drama and comedy, fast-paced and deliberately choppy editing. Each episode usually began with morning roll call and ended late at night, with several stories interwoven in between.

Episode 36: ""Trial by Fury"" (Written by David Milch, First aired September 30, 1982,) was the season premiere for the third season. It may be the best single television episode I have ever seen in my life (yes, better than ""Love's Labor Lost"" on ""ER"" and ""Becoming, Part 2"" on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and I have used it in my television classes every chance I get. At a Hill Street church, Rombardi, her name in Christ, Sister Anna Carmela, is raped and murdered, outraging both the citizens on the Hill as well as Captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) and his cops. When Celestine Grey and Gerald Chapman are arrested fleeing from a pawnshop where they were trying to fence some items stolen from the church where Sister Anna was attacked everybody knows they have the assailants.  But there is a lack of physical evidence to tie them to the assault and Belker (Bruce Weitz) pointedly asks Furillo, ""Are these guys gonna walk?""  Then Furillo, in a chilling sequence, decides to use the lynch mob outside the precinct to coerce a confession from the assailants, one of whom is a client of public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel).

Television does not get any better than this episode and both the final confrontation between Furillo and Davenport, and the touching coda amply prove the point.  There is also a parallel subplot in ""Trial by Fury"" where investigation of the robbery and murder of a store clerk on the Hill goes nowhere because all of the attention is on what happened to Sister Anna.  What makes this episode so special is that it looks at the issue from both sides, and while we clearly root for Furillo to make sure that justice is done, both the character and the audience are forced in the end to consider what they have done.

Milch, who went on to create ""N.Y.P.D. Blue"" and ""Deadwood,"" won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series in 1981 for this episode.  It also was the episode that earned the series the third of four consecutive Emmys for Best Dramatic Program.  Without ""Hill Street Blues"" there is no ""St. Elsewhere"" or ""L.A. Law,"" which in turn would have meant no ""E.R.,"" no ""N.Y.P.D. Blue,"" and pretty much no whatever you favorite drama of the last decade has been. Contemporary adult television comes from THIS program. It is one of the 10 best ever on television in terms of writing and acting and ""Trial by Fury"" is one of the 10 best episodes ever aired on television.",1124236800,6,3122,4.777365491651206
