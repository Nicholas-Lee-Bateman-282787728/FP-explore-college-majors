8630203,1,B001CHG9L4,"Adz may be an OK golf player, but he is a terribly irresponsible and lousy golf instructor.  He sucks! He asked people to pay the full amount for 8 lesseions.  We did.  After the third lessen, he never showed up.  It is such a hassle to schedule classes with him.  He never replied our emails/phone calls to schedule classes.

We heard from the Philadelphia FDR center that this is a very typical behiavoral pattern of him.  He asked for the full amount and disappeared after the 3rd class.

Anyway, don't buy his DVD and don't schedule classes with him.",1248307200,,554,4.525252525252525
