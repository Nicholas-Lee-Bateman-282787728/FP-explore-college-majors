5979834,2,B00FEHCPZ2,"""Once Mr. Alexander is gone everything is gonna be fine."" Crime boss Mr. Alexander (Seagal) runs things his way and doesn't like when things don't go according to plan. When things don't go his way he is forced into a war with rival Iceman (Rhames) as well as many other crime lords all trying to take control of the city. So...um...this movie has Steven Seagal, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames as the big draws. What else can I say? If you like them you will like this...if not then avoid this. This is generic and repetitive. Pretty much what you would expect from another Steven Seagal movie really. Overall, I have said you can't judge a movie by it's cover. This is the exception.

5979835,5,B00FEHCPZ2,"This movie was well worth waiting for. There is great action throughout the whole movie,supplied mainly by both Steven Seagal and Bren Foster. Both men are great martial artists and very good actors. Bren's fights are a little flashier with flying and spinning kicks as well as some acrobatic wall climbing,but still realistic and Steven's fights are very straight-forward and,as always,very real and devastating. He is truly one of a kind. I think he still has a few more films in store for us as well as some more music cds and tours. If you enjoy good action and incredible martial arts displays,BUY THIS MOVIE!",1386806400,9,614,4.857142857142857
5979836,5,B00FEHCPZ2,"This movie is absolutely incredible. Another Segalian flick, proving that this hero's flame is undying. This is a MUST SEE!",1386633600,,123,5.2
5979837,4,B00FEHCPZ2,"After a relatively high publicity run, things are sort of looking down for Steven Seagal: not only is he receiving criticism for his partnerships with Joe Arpaio and Vladimir Putin, but his UFC protg Anderson Silva seems to be publicly distancing himself from the Buddhist Bonecrusher. Seagal's in need of a good movie like few times before, and luckily he's gotten one in ""Force of Execution."" I'm genuinely surprised by how much I like this film, which may very well be the most action-packed flick Seagal has done in quite some time. It's not nearly perfect and it isn't even really a vehicle for the man, but I predict that a lot of fans and action devotees in general will like this one.

The story: an emerging crime lord (Ving Rhames,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tournament/dp/B002FOFX9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tournament</a>) prepares for a bloody street war with the established kingpin (Seagal). In the middle of this, a former protg of the latter (Bren Foster) - maimed and cast out for a past failure - must decide whether he will play a part in the violence to come.

Seagal seems really into his role: he tries for an accent again, but more notably has the tone and personality of the antihero down pat, as though he prepared for the part with a Coppola marathon. He's matched in presence by Ving Rhames, who can do these tough guy roles in his sleep but doesn't phone in his performance at all. Danny Trejo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-in-Tombstone/dp/B00E8AVNAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead in Tombstone</a>) is here as well, playing the grizzled owner of a diner, but the real star of the movie is in fact Bren Foster. Graduating from his supporting part in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maximum-Conviction/dp/B0090EDEM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maximum Conviction</a>, Foster soundly steals the show out from under his better-known costars and makes the movie his own by being not only an impressive martial artist but also a surprisingly adept actor, turning his portions of the plot into generally the most interesting ones.

Director Keoni Waxman seems to be the preferred filmmaker of Seagal these days, much to my chagrin since I'm not a huge fan of any of the work they've done together, but he redeems himself by not only directing a better-made movie in this, but also a more interesting one. There are some of those annoying DTV slights that we've had to get used to - Seagal's dialogue being dubbed here and there, scenes between characters wherein the actors were clearly never in the same room, etc. - but they appear to a lesser extent than expected. The writing is also better than one might expect, with more character development scenes than are the norm for low budget action fare, and occasional weird/cool moments (SPOILER) like when Trejo reveals himself to be a ""Mexican witch doctor"" and cures Bren Foster's injured hands with live scorpion venom.

One of the major complaints among viewers of Seagal's movies of the last ten years is their relatively meager martial arts contents, and ""Force of Execution"" addresses this qualm with no less than 10 hand-to-hand brawls - 13 if you include the short ones. Thanks to Foster, these may also be the most legitimately athletic fights we've seen in Steven's movies since early in his career. Seagal is more than serviceable for his four tussles, relying less on doubles than in his worst films, and even Ving Rhames mixes things up in a single brawl, but it's Bren's work as both an acrobat and a down-to-earth martial artist who elevates the entire picture. Think Scott Adkins without the gratuitous flipping. The scenes wherein he takes out a hallway full of prison guards and duels escrima guru Ron Balicki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prodigy/dp/B000R2PNTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prodigy</a>) with knives are standouts, and should make Seagal consider handing the reins to other martial artists more often in his movies.

Speaking of Steven, I have the feeling that he's finally winding down. I may be reading too much into this, but his character alludes more than once to ""retiring"" and references his age in a negative context as well. In playing the part, he really gives the impression that he feels he ought to be done with this kind of stuff. Seagal still has a role in at least one more movie coming out, but should this indeed be the time that he hangs up his gloves as a leading man, he chose a pretty satisfying movie to mark the occasion. Buy it, fans!",1386547200,16,4662,5.286099865047233
5979838,1,B00FEHCPZ2,"I guess Seagal is now and old man, a fat man, and now a has been.  This film isn't even good enough to be rated a ""B"" flick and it certainly lacks any, any similarity to any of his previous better films.

This flick is either an ""F"" Grade flick or the dying embers of a once great person on his way off the stage.

Save your money.  Garbage is garbage.  ""F"" Grade flicks, no matter the names of actors, are still ""F"" grade flicks.",1386201600,2,430,4.011764705882353
5979839,4,B00FEHCPZ2,"Mr. Alexander (Steven Seagal) is an ex-government agent who learned ""things"" in the mountains of Thailand. He is now the crime boss over the city of Albuquerque. Iceman (Ving Rhames) has recently got out of prison and is challenging Alexander, who simply wants to be bought out honorably. In what passes for a Seagal subplot, Roman Hurst (Bren Foster)who works for Alexander, gets double crossed by Iceman and is forced to retire, losing the use of his hands- somewhat, but he can still slow motion kickbox. He now lives in a room off a diner owned by Alexander and run by Jimmy Peanuts (Danny Trejo). The waitress (Jenny Gabrielle) becomes a focal point, because that is where the crime boss likes his girlfriend to work.

The plot, like Seagal is straight forward. Trejo supplies us with a surprise, but the plot is not twisty. The tough guy dialog is cliche, using lines like, ""You broke the code."" Seagal is a bad guy who kills people, but commands with over doses of corny respect speeches. At one point Seagal sits down and describes his gun collection, giving us the advantage points of each piece, topping it off with ""Isn't that amazing.""

I found this to be a better quality Seagal film, as he is not in every scene and shares with Rhames and Trejo.

4 stars on the Seagal scale. 2 stars for non-fans.

5979908,2,B00FEHCPZ2,"I watched Force of Execution because of Bren Foster, a black-belt martial artist. However, he happens not to be on the DVD cover. Its strange because he is the only one who delivers action here.

The films star is of course Steven Seagal. This time he plays a mobster named Alexander with his own code of ethics, but he is not exactly a villain. Or is he? It doesnt matter because his action sequences (only a few times) are forgettable with choppy editing.

Ving Rhames is Ice Man, a power-hungry crime lord. Danny Trejo is Jimmy Peanuts, owner of a small restaurant, who seems to know Alexander. I give up summarizing the story because it doesnt make much sense. Director Keoni Waxman seems interested only in cinematography.

The only reason you should see Force of Execution is Bren Foster, who shows what a real martial artist can do (see his amazing kick). Unfortunately, the film does not allow him to do that much, with his character as Alexanders trusted man sidelined for the most part of the mid-section of the film. The rest of the film is dull talk and even duller shoot-outs.",1427846400,,1089,4.632124352331606

5979951,3,B00FEHCPZ2,"THE FILM: Seagal's best days are now far behind him, but he's made a niche for himself in the DTV market. FORCE OF EXECUTION, while not one of the better movies he's made, is at least watchable and has some good action to boot. This time around, Seagal is Alexander, a crime boss with a past in government special ops. He runs a southwestern town with an iron fist, to be sure, but backed up with a code of honor. Martial artist Bren Foster plays Hurst, Alexander's chief hitman and a protege of sorts. They are joined in the cast by Ving Rhames, an up-and-coming gangster and Danny Trejo as a bar owner with a few tricks up his sleeve. The event that sets the plot in motion is a hit that goes bad, resulting in Hurst's ""retirement,"" and the severe injury of his hands. Meanwhile, Iceman (Rhames) maneuvers around Alexander in order to take control of his territory, climaxing in a showdown between the two gangs. First, the good parts. Seagal is playing a type of character that he doesn't usually play, an antihero of sorts in a movie populated solely with lowlifes. There is also some decent martial arts on display, but mostly from Bren Foster. Seagal is relegated to doing his usual chops and takedowns when he isn't just using firearms. On the subject of firearms, there's a brief scene in which he gets to show off several of guns and goes into their specs and capabilities. Kind of meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but an interesting flourish that has Seagal written all over it. Finally, Ving Rhames gives the best performance in the movie as Iceman, lending credibility to his role as a gangster and delivering some great improvised dialogue. The rest is mediocre at best. The basic plot is paper thin, and not enough time is spent developing the three main characters. Most of the dialogue scenes are corny discussions about honor and respect, tough talking without any purpose other than to make the characters seem tougher. As far as the technical aspects go, director Keoni Waxman opts for the currently in-vogue shaky-cam, and some of the editing choices obscure the action. While this was most likely to conceal stunt doubles in some shots, it makes the action hard to follow in places, especially with Seagal. Fortunately for Bren Foster, they pulled back the camera a little bit so you can see him work.

THE EXTRAS: The sole special feature is a 17-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that delves into the story and the fights. Honestly, there wasn't a lot of value here, but it was interesting (if a little hilarious) to hear Ving Rhames briefly discuss the Stanislavsky acting method (in a film like this?) and Seagal go on and on about the realism he was aiming for. The biggest thing I took away is that, despite their insistence that action came with story, they paid more attention to the fights than the actual story. Not surprising, really.

OVERALL: Overall, while a little cheap-looking and dull, FORCE OF EXECUTION should be enough to placate Seagal fans. The bonus featurette also makes for an interesting watch. Everyone else, just stay away.",1412985600,,3085,4.753731343283582

The fat and slow Segal plays a low life gangster in a film that really has no meaning and no purpose .. just fill the time with lots of gangsters shooting each other.

I saw no reason for the loyalty shown by our ""hero"". I could barely understand the lines of Steven Seagal. A lot minor A listers in the movie, but really that is its only redeeming quality. I gave it three stars because I watched it all the way, so it was at least decent enough for that.",1394236800,,418,3.8160919540229883

5979995,2,B00FEHCPZ2,"Let me be the first to say it. Okay maybe not the first but among the folks who want it to be known. Steven Seagal, that wonder of movie martial arts flicks needs to stop what he's doing, stop thinking he knows what's best and start listening to directors and writers who make movies. Once he does that perhaps he'll stop starring in direct to video crap like this and make good movies once again.

Seagal plays a crime lord here, a man who used to work for some unnamed government agency that did bad things (routine for Seagal movies these days) who turned those skills into a way to make money. His protg Roman (Bren Foster) is sent on a mission to kill an inmate at the local prison. Signaled wrongly on purpose by Ice Man (Ving Rhames) for some reason, he must pay the price for a job gone wrong. Seagal allows the employer time with Roman alone during which he breaks both of his hands.

Months pass and now Roman is a drunk on the streets whose hands have healed improperly. He's now living in a room above a restaurant owned by Seagal's daughter Karen. There he makes friends of a sort with her cook Jimmy Peanuts (Danny Trejo). As the film progresses we learn that Jimmy is there not to just cook but protect Karen as well.

Problems arise when Ice Man is released from prison and decided to take over the empire created by Seagal and his partners. Wiping out the partners one by one, he sets his sites on the whole ball of wax. Each step brings him closer and closer to Seagal and an eventual showdown is bound to happen. So how does Roman come into this? Seagal has been footing the bill for him ever since his hands were broken. The damaged hands have prevented him from using his martial arts skills to kill people but the skills are still there, especially in his legwork which we see when some goons try to hold up Jimmy. Just how Seagal helps Roman with his hands is beyond belief and more along the lines of you gotta be kidding me than wow that's amazing. Let's just hope no one with damaged hands follows the instructions used here.

The movie plays at the slowest pace possible and the acting leaves much to be desired. Production values are solid here but that's about it. I've read that Seagal has a penchant for telling writers and directors that he knows best what words to say and how to say them. If that were the case he'd be making better movies. I'm sorry but it's the truth and someone needs to tell him. Rhames and Trejo have both done better and deserve to be in a better film than this one. If they continue down this path they'll be making only direct to DVD films as well.

The only standout here is Bren Foster who has the opportunity to break out of these sorts of films and become a star. He's got the good looks necessary to be a star and his ability in martial arts seems top notch. He just needs to find the right vehicle to display those abilities and this isn't it. Good luck to him in the future. And good luck to Seagal if he continues to make movies like this.",1393372800,,3006,4.294532627865961
5979996,5,B00FEHCPZ2,It's Steven Seagal.  It's Danny Trejo.  Says it all.  Interesting story line.  A different role for Seagal.  The 2nd movie for Seagal & Trejo.  Interesting combination.  Maybe more to come?,1393286400,,189,5.1

5980003,5,B00FEHCPZ2,"Thought we had lost him back in the mid-2000's. Those movies he was kicking out in Romania and Poland were so sub-standard. Now, since around 2009, his movies deliver a good bit of the tension and action that made him a cult hero. I wish that the producers would pay more attention to detail and produce something on par with Above the Law. THAT would be the ultimate Seagal comeback movie. It CAN be done. May we see it happen in our lifetime.

5980022,5,B00FEHCPZ2,"I have always loved Steven Seagal's Movies.  It is obvious that he is getting older like most of us but I still enjoy his older movies, which I tend to watch more than once or twice, or a newer movie I have not seen before.  They are not the kind of movies that get Academy Awards but they are great movies that you watch just the action and many times bad acting that you find in them.  As usual, Steven usually wins in the end even when he plays a bad guy as he did in this movie.  But in the end he shows that he still has a good heart as he walks away the winner.  If you are looking for a movie just to enjoy some action, then watch this one.",1388966400,4,647,3.8345864661654137
5980023,3,B00FEHCPZ2,"Plenty went wrong.  I expected major bad-ass action from Danny and Ving but instead it was almost as if they were patsies for Steven Seagal.  Ving is usually a cool on-screen tough guy but he came across as a confused gangster who couldn't play the crime game against Seagal.  Danny Trejo always plays a mean, bad-tempered and intimidating tough guy but instead he played a nice guy who might get mean if you hurt his feelings.  Although there's some good shootouts, this film just doesn't used these 2 guys to their maximum potential.",1388966400,2,535,4.720430107526882
5980024,3,B00FEHCPZ2,"I have always liked Seagal movies so I was glad when he was finally released from his last movie contract so he could once again make  some movies like Hard to Kill or Under Siege.

5980027,3,B00FEHCPZ2,"Awww, crap...another Seagal movie that sucks.  Why in the heck can't he just use his normal voice nowadays, instead of mumbling stuff nobody can understand?  Listen to him in the special feature included on the disc - sounds like a regular dude talking.  Listen to him in the movie - does he think mumbling makes him seem more menacing or something?  I don't know.  Anyway, the movie is great if you're a Bren Foster fan, as he has lots of screen time and does lots of his usually great martial arts.  The remainder of the film is just so-so, and downright stupid in some places, such as when Seagal has his henchman beaten to a pulp for screwing up a hit and then later gives him a bunch of money because he's ""family.""  I can't remember the last time I had a family member beaten up for something, but then I'm over 50 and might not understand this new era. Anyway, watch the movie just for Bren Foster.  As a Seagal flick, it's better than Submerged but not as good as Urban Justice.",1388448000,2,986,4.3497267759562845

5980029,1,B00FEHCPZ2,"This movie is very hard to follow. The plot is not really clear. I have all of Steven Seagal's movies and this one is hard to understand the slurring of speech, slang, too much vulgarity and I can't get past the attitudes of the actors to dig into any kind of richness in the plot. This one, along with the Vampire movie of his, was not worth the money. Also, the DVD was real cheap looking, almost like a knock-off, and I had a hard time controlling the DVD. I had to go into the scene selection section to start the movie. Let's get the product quality up there again Steve, like you used to do.",1388102400,4,597,4.155172413793103

8614812,5,B00FEHCPZ2,"Steven Seagal plays a gangster in this 2013 film who wants to retire. He has a fault, a sense of honor, a feeling that people should do as they are told to do; otherwise they will be punished. A man, knowing this, takes advantage of it. This man wants to take over Seagals mob, and to do so he needs to get rid of Seagals very competent right hand man.
He hires Segal to have his right hand man kill a certain person. Then, at the last minute, he tells the killer to kill another man instead. Then he complains to Seagal that his man did not kill the right person. While he likes his right hand man a lot, he orders him to be punished by breaking his hands. In this way the right hand man is no longer a threat to the man who wants to take over the mob, because now Seagal has no choice but to retire him. The man then begins to take over different parts of the mobsters holdings. This leads to a mob war.
The film is filled with violence, naked girls, attempted rape of Seagals woman, and lots of action  shootings, stabbings, surprise assaults, and many hand to hand combats.",1526947200,,1077,4.177884615384615
