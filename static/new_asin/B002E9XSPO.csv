Despite that oversight, I must say that this is one of the best produced and filmed videos ever to be made. The performances of Ashton Moore and Asia Carrera, a Hall of Famer, put this movie in the stratosphere.

The plot deals with a conservationist who seeks to save and protect the Snow Leopard (An Endangered Species) from extinction. She travels to Barca, a land in the far east, to find and save one. She is with her faithful assistant, the gorgeous Ashton Moore, a woman no man could resist. Along the way, she encounters a guide (Played By Steven St. Croix) and a photographer named Mr. Lexington. Mr. Lexington is a man who is enraptured by Asia's character. By the end of the video we will see why this is the case. I will not give away the ending, however.

This video is marathon in length, but this allows the viewer to enjoy almost ten full sex scenes that are almost all Volcanic. While the plot sustained the movie, I felt the last 25 minutes were a bit over the top. Despite this quibble, I rate this video Four and a Half Stars. Buy it and you will not be disappointed! I plan to get the DVD now to see what extras might have been placed on it. Do not pay attention to the Game Link reviews of this DVD transfer. In no way is this a Three Star production! It's no less than Four Stars and by far an argument could be made it is a Five Star production.

This shot on film production may well have been Asia Carrera's best ever role. Every red-blooded man laments her departure from Adult Film Industry and we wish she was still involved in some way behind the scenes at least. She was a super-star the likes of which we may never see again.
