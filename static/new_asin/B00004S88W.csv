7921777,5,B00004S88W,"I really enjoyed this workout!  I've practiced Pilates for several years now but have only one other video which uses the fitness circle.  What I liked about this video is that it was a traditional Pilates mat workout, but adding the fitness circle made the routine even more focused on the abdominal area; I also liked that the circle provided additional work for the glutes and thighs.  Moira Stott-Merrithew instructs two students, Miriane and Crispin, each of whom performs the movements in a slightly different manner.

The workout begins with a few minutes of breathing practice followed by some abs prep work without the circle.  The circle is then incorporated into all of the classic Pilates mat movements, sometimes holding the circle in your hands, sometimes between your knees, and sometimes between your ankles.  A few moves are modified to target a different area using the circle--for example, both leg circles and the saw became hamstring stretches.  There are also various movements which target your arms, some done while lying on your back (and still pulling in your abs), and some performed in a seated position.  At about 32 minutes, this video provided me with an excellent, full-body workout, and I plan to use it often.",1098144000,5,1243,5.0
