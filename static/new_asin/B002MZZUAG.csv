8374475,3,B002MZZUAG,They apparently used the same shooting script as the 1940 movie Kit Carson which was better and of higher quality. They only thing they changed was the names. There is no relation to history or to any person living or dead.,1468022400,,223,4.463414634146342

8374478,3,B002MZZUAG,"Veteran character actor Jim Davis appeared in just about everything on TV and in many westerns.  He was the lead in Stories Of The Century as Matt Clark railroad detective, a mainstay in the short lived TV series The Cowboys and of course Jock Ewing on Dallas.  He was a regular in B westerns and got to be the lead in a handful and this is one of them.  He always turns in a solid performance and here he plays Mountain Man Jim Stockton who takes a job along with two of his pals to lead a wagon train through Indian country to California.  Add in a taste of politics with the Spaniards in California trying to break free from the yoke of Mexico City to align themselves with the Yankees from the United States.  Mexico has aligned with the Shoshone and is providing them with guns to make sure no wagon trains get through.  Not a bad B, worth a watch for western fans.",1423699200,,870,4.242424242424242
8374479,4,B002MZZUAG,As far as B Western's go this movie is okay considering they were made with small budgets and filmed in black and white,1390089600,,119,4.217391304347826
8374480,1,B002MZZUAG,"Please note the DVD is of very bad quality.
This 1960 film film is  worst than an unrestored movie of the 20ies.

There is even a graphic (1 or 2 numbers) incrustation in the middle of the screen for very long minutes during the movie.

Save your money for serious DVD editors.",1328054400,,277,4.288461538461538
8374481,5,B002MZZUAG,A good western.  I didn't know it had been made. It was a good depiction of what life would have been like in that time; entertaining.,1297814400,,134,4.153846153846154
