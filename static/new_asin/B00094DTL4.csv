2264529,5,B00094DTL4,Short sweet and terrific version of A Christmas Carol. Great to hear Alistair Sim and Michael Hordern from the 1951 film...the best telling/acted version. Chuck Jones at the helm:) The drawing/animation is great!,1357603200,,212,5.454545454545454
2264530,5,B00094DTL4,"I remembered seeing this Christmas special when I was a child, and it kind of frightened me back then. Now I would call it ""deliciously creepy"". It is probably not for very small children, in fact certain scenes stayed with me even from a young age-I'm not really sure my parents watched it with me back then :) But I saw that it did win an oscar, for best animated short story (its only 27 minutes long), and I do think the animation is truly a work of art. It reminds us what the Christmas holiday is really about, and does malkes you think and count your blessings.",1356739200,,568,4.268518518518518
2264531,5,B00094DTL4,"The unequaled BEST animated version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL ever!!  Turn out the lights, pop this DVD in the player on your big screen TV and prepare for the true GHOST STORY that Charles Dickens intended A CHRISTMAS CAROL to be. The animation from Chuck Jones (of Looney Tunes, Grinch, and Tom & Jerry fame), the voice-over of original Scrooge Alistair Sim, and the outright scare your wits away ghost of Jacob Marley make this the BEST version ever.  HANDS DOWN!!!",1355875200,4,463,4.703703703703703
2264532,4,B00094DTL4,"I just watched this animated short on YouTube. I had read a review & recommendation of it on a different site but was not convinced to buy it without viewing it first. At just 28 minutes the wonderful animation and perfect voices will leave you wanting to hit replay! This short first aired on PBS and has been relegated to the high prices of out of print movies and almost utterly overlooked.  This is not a cheaply animated movie that flashes bright color to entertain children. Instead it is a top notch work that is a lithograph of Victorian England. The voicing is superb and it just works! The adaption is quite true to spirit of Dickens story & is the reason for it's shortness.  It is a gem to watch and deserves a high spot on list of favorite versions of ""A Christmas Carol"". I invite you to watch it on YouTube then rush back to Amazon to buy a copy before it's removed from YouTube! I wish Amazon Instant Video had this as an option, I'd download in an instant! *not sure if younger audiences would enjoy it as much because they are so used to computer animated movies now.",1355702400,11,1085,4.366336633663367
2264533,5,B00094DTL4,"This 30 minute animated version of A Christmas Carol stars Alistair Sim and Michael Hordern reprising their roles as Scrooge and Marley's ghost that they famously portrayed in the 1951 feature film that is the best version of the story ever made.

It used to air on TV in the 1970s but was forgotten. It really is a must see during the holiday season.",1354838400,4,351,4.484375
2264534,3,B00094DTL4,"VCI's version of the 1951 Alastair Sim A CHRISTMAS CAROL is troublesome not for the colorization, but the audio-- which is heavily filtered, a bit tinny and at times has an added echo that makes understanding dialogue troublesome even with a good sound system. Color enhancement is about average; the print used being less than pristine-- rather surprising since it underwent all that computer work.

VHS tape is recorded in SP mode, with a HiFi audio track.

The script loosely follows Dickens' short story. Sim is marvelous and at times moving as Ebenezer Scrooge. The pace bogs down a bit only during the Ghost of Christmas Past section. (Watch for Patrick Macnee as young Jacob Marley.)

2264633,5,B00094DTL4,"I have spent many years waiting for a DVD release of this wonderful version of A Christmas Carol. It's a classic from the early 70's and it's one I remember seeing on  Christmas Eve back then when I was a child and it scared me so much! The scene with Marleys ghost had me petrified!! I was only 6 at the time but I'll never forget that first viewing! It had a great influence on me regarding the Dickens classic as I've collected every Christmas Carol/ Scrooge movie there is! And finally managed to get a copy of this one that started it all. For me, a Christmas Carol is Christmas and always will be. Such a truly wonderful story and no Santa Claus mentioned! As back then......he was Father Christmas!",1481068800,,705,4.3816793893129775

2264635,1,B00094DTL4,"This dvd is terrible. There is no disc menu just a singing commercial for Starry Night Video, the company that produced it. That's bad enough but the ditty is grating and continues until you hit the play button.
The sound on the dvd is probably the worst I've ever heard. I have a taped from TV vhs copy with much better sound. On my surround sound system the sound from this dvd comes only from the center channel and is very difficult to understand.

2264710,5,B00094DTL4,"When I was a kid, one thing that my brother and I did, without fail, each Christmas season, was to flick through the channels to see if we could find a showing of A Christmas Carol. Not just any Christmas Carol though, it had to be the Alastair Sims version. As I've grown, I've met many people how hold the same opinion on this version, that is, it may not be the most popular, but, those who love this version are absolutely devoted to it and will not likely be satisfied with any other. This is almost entirely the result of the wonderful performance of Mr. Sims, who seems to born to play the role. A huge part of playing Scrooge is in the transformation scenes when Scrooge awakes on Christmas morning. In opinion, no one comes close to Sims at absolutely owning these scenes. Another great aspect of the film is that it uses much of Dickens's original dialog; a treat for those who are familiar with the book itself.  I had owned a horrible pressing of this film for many years now, and bought this one figuring it couldn't be worse. I was correct in that; the transfer looks great. There are some issues with the sound at times; sounding like it was recorded in men's room, but that seems to be a short coming of the original film rather than of the transfer. The one strange thing about this disc is that there is no menu. When you put the disc in, it plays a loop of an annoying jingle for the production company and no menu comes up, but just hit play at this point and you're good to go.",1451433600,5,1498,4.274647887323944
2264711,5,B00094DTL4,Good version of the story. The CD arrived on time and was well-packaged. It is the B&W version but quite entertaining.,1451174400,,118,4.666666666666667

2264718,5,B00094DTL4,"Due to the circumstances and choices in the life of Ebenezer Scrooge, he has chosen money over mankind. His partner now seven years dead comes back to warn Ebenezer of his afterlife fate if he does not change his ways. To assist in this task are three spirits, Christmas past (his past), Christmas present, and Christmas of things to come. Can or will Ebenezer change his ways? Why should he?

There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.

Made in the era of black and white, one cannot help but shun any attempt to colorize it. The Alastair Sim version is a product of its day and he does a very good job of portraying Ebenezer Scrooge. He comes across as mean in his speech of Are there no work houses? and stingy, displayed during his meal, upon hearing that more bread will cost 8 pence extra he says, No more bread.

On Christmas morning he goes overboard with the maniacal laughter. This is probably emphasized to show his change of heart and to allow him to scare the maid. However it does distract from the story. The story is modified a bit but unless you have been reading the book you will not notice this. To tie his childhood memories of his sister to his present day nephew, they play Barbra Allen in the back ground (nice touch.)

All in all this will make a nice addition to you Christmas collection.

There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.

Well with all the media adaptations, we finally have Blu-ray. From history, I find that a good remaster and a 46 screen work well enough. However, because I have a Blu-ray player I chose Blu-ray when ever available at any cost. I am not so sure the film is really cleaned up or remastered. However, it is quite sharp black & white. The film is quite sparse of DVD extras. You will find the Commentary by Marcus Hern and George Cole (Young Ebenezer Scrooge) under the setup and not the extras. The DVD starts with a long VCI Entertainment advertisement.

2264719,1,B00094DTL4,"Caveat emptor! The ABC Video release of this classic Television film is the worst quality picture I've ever seen on a DVD. The sound, while adequate, is at least coherent. The picture, less so. the color is hot and blurry, or washed out, the picture fuzzy, and, because it's a transfer from VHS, a WORN VHS at that, you actually get emulsion lines in places. This DVD release of a magnificent animated film is an abomination, and to say it deserves better than this is, to say the least, an understatement.
Don't go near it. The DVD was expensive to boot, in the mid-$20 range. If YouTube is the best you can do, it can't be any worse than this. Don't go near it.",1388793600,,663,4.354838709677419
2264720,5,B00094DTL4,"I don't understand it.  This is THE best animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" I've ever seen and one of the best adaptations ever.  It won an Emmy.  For three or four years, when I was a child in the early 1970's, it was shown on TV each year, and my family faithfully watched and looked forward to it.  Then all of a sudden, it disappeared from TV.

Fast forward to the video era:  Although this version was apparently issued on VHS at some point, my family members and I were never able to find it.  My sister and I certainly tried, so I can only suppose that this version wasn't widely distributed, although video tapes of other animated versions certainly were.

With the maturing of the internet age, my family and I FINALLY got to see this version again a few years ago - for the first time in over 30 years - courtesy of Google Video.  Since having found out that there was indeed a VHS release, I've sought in vain for an affordable copy; unfortunately, however, it would seem that there are so few available, and they're so in demand, that the show has become a collector's item.

Now I see that it's finally been released on DVD - supposedly - but it's out of stock, and Amazon doesn't know when or if it will be available again!  The reviews show that my family and I aren't the only ones who have been mystified and frustrated by the inaccessibility of this particular version of the Dickens classic.  The only thing I can figure is that someone in control of the rights to this version is sitting on them . . . being as stingy as Scrooge himself (before receiving his ghostly visitors) with the licensing to distribute or broadcast (perhaps requiring exorbitant fees?) . . . though to what end, I can scarcely imagine, because there's obviously great interest out there, and you'd think he or she could make a mint (without requiring exorbitant fees)!  Whoever it is must imagine that there's more to be gained by teasing the public and driving up the selling price for anyone lucky enough to have whatever tapes and DVDs exist.",1387324800,2,2044,4.491891891891892
2264721,5,B00094DTL4,"This beautiffully crafted hand drawn animated special has superb animation! The beautifull, linear detail of the cell animation are like moving detailed etchings!

2264722,5,B00094DTL4,"The New York Times had piece in the Entertainment section in December of 1976 of one of the last interviews with Charles Dickens' great, great, great grand daughter.  The topic, was of course, ""A Christmas Carol"".  Having seen all versions (at that time) her valued opinion was that, "" . . . the 1951 version with Alastair Sim was the most accurate to the original script and by far the most entertaining for the whole family.  ""Alastair Sim played the part of Scrooge to the tee"", she said.  He conveyed the change that C. Dickens wanted to have happen in a miserly old man, especially around Christmas time.""

There are at least 8 versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", all are extremely well done and entertaining.  I've seen them all several times, and I have to say, I whole heartedly agree with Miss Dickens' opinion.  The 1951 version is the only version I bought.  Mr. Sim has a way about him that brings out the good, the bad and the real change.  What a joy it is to watch.  Of course, we always watch it the night before Christmas.",1380672000,6,1036,4.462765957446808
