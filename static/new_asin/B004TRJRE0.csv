This K-ON disc made me want to watch the third right after(school night, bed time, mehh..). If you haven't seen the first disc I suggest doing that. If you have watched the first and enjoyed it as much as I did you'll know what I'm talking about! It is simple, clean, and cute. K-ON! is definitely worth checking into.

This order came sooner than expected! The packaging was great. Slight skipping, but after wiping the disc twice gently it played smoothly.",1412208000,,573,4.673267326732673
8440812,5,B004TRJRE0,"If you're looking at the review for the second volume of season 1, then chances are that you've seen the whole series, and that you already own volume 1, so I'll spare you the drab and inconsise review of the show itself because we both know it's fantastic, so instead I'll compare it to a few of the other entry-level schoolgirl animes.

This belongs in your collection if you like slice of life or school life. It surpasses its competitors(Yuyushiki, Lucky Star, Yuru Yuri, Tamayura, so on and so forth) because it incorporates the typical tsukkomi/boke(A.K.A straight man/funny man) that japanese humor is based around, but also has event-related humor. Shows like Yuyushiki, Lucky Star, and Yuru Yuri are built almost entirely on the Manzai(the name for the tsukkomi/boke humor) humor platform. Lucky Star distinguished itself by incorporating skit comedy, instead of the daily flow that other shows go(wake up scene, morning classes scene, lunch scene, club/after school scene, home scene, repeat) but the humor is still the same.

K-On! only uses Manzai humor as an undertone, instead of centralizing the humor around it like every other anime in the world.

tl;dr K-On! is the best anime and Mio is best waifu. i guess i'll also take this opportunity to suggest that you watch ""Humanity Has Declined"", because it's amazing.",1391212800,,1330,5.036363636363636
8440813,5,B004TRJRE0,"K-On is an excellent Series, Combining Musical Features with Reality, Making it feel like you are apart of a band! (I have Previous Band Experience.) Going through the motivation, and fun events and learning about each-other more and more.",1371859200,,239,5.153846153846154
8440814,5,B004TRJRE0,"I think that this anime is one of the best, in my opinion. It's smart, funny, and original. If you want to see the lives of some not-so-ordinary teenage girls who build their own rock club, I suggest you watch this. The main character is a girl named Yui Hirasawa who joins the dying club, and discovers just how much she loves music and being with the friends who help her along the way. And in this volume, the high school adventures continue. Great for everyone of all ages!",1368662400,,477,4.370786516853933
8440815,5,B004TRJRE0,"It was a great DVD no scratches top quality product, shipped fast and in one piece. I loved it 5 stars",1363046400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8440816,5,B004TRJRE0,Great lighthearted series about a group of high school students joining a music club that I would recommend for anyone or even families to watch.,1355097600,,145,4.84
8440817,4,B004TRJRE0,"While volume 1 set up the characters, volume 2 sets the story in motion. Containing episodes 5-8 we get to see the girls have there first concert, throw a Christmas party and try and recruit new members. Overall volume 2 really picks up the pace and for me things flow nicely. One of the things I love about K-On as a whole is that it's not a series you have to focus the whole time, you can just check your brain at the door sit back and enjoy a good light hearted comedy. The real star of the series is ,as corny as this sounds, the music itself.

Now getting to the basics of this volume, The voice acting from the English dub team at Bang-Zoom continues to improve and the actresses are getting better and more suited in there roles. However the Japanese version is still my preferred track. A lot of people have complained about the 2.0 stereo track, while yes I would love to have the dub in TrueHD 5.1 Lossless audio, It doesn't bother me that much and both tracks come though clear and with good quality. The bonus features are well done with a interview with Cristina Vee (English voice for Mio) as well as an English version of the one of the songs ""Fuwa Fuwa Time"" witch sounds really good in my opinion.",1311638400,2,1215,4.3056768558951966
8440818,4,B004TRJRE0,"K-ON! vol 2 continues the first season of the series. Though more of a sitcom style series (there is no real overlying plot, aside from the general background oh high school life) with each episode bringing up new adventures and possibilities. But K-ON! is better known for the adorable characters (Mio Akayama has an insanely large otaku following), the fun music, and, most important, the mood that the series cultivates. This series has such a feel-good take on friendship that it makes for a really fun slice of life style anime.

I love the K-ON! series (including the K-ON!! follow up), though i understand the criticism that there isn't much plot development and the characters don't arc much. However, if you are looking for a series wherein you can enjoy a fun cast of characters and join them for their afternoon tea, then this will prove to be a rewarding series. You will like this if you enjoyed Azumanga Daioh. it has a similar feel.

a note on the product: 100 minutes seems not much (half of a short season). but if you already got volume 1, this will make for a necessary follow up.",1305849600,8,1099,4.630769230769231
