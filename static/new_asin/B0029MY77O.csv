8357983,5,B0029MY77O,This dvd set is in great condition. The quality is more than I expected. I finally get to see fights that I've only heard about.,1401840000,,128,4.16
8357984,5,B0029MY77O,"Bought this set for my nephew. He said it was in great condition. The only thing he mentioned was that per the advertisement, he was expecting 5 individual cases, not one case with 5 cd's. We were both extremely surprise that I received my order the next working day.",1393891200,,267,4.469387755102041
8357985,5,B0029MY77O,"I never thought I would see these fights on DVD. Awesome! I was a little leary of the packaging because it looked like something that might be from overseas, but it's the real deal. I assume it's the whole PPV that was shown. Promos for upcoming events, games and after fight interviews are all here. Alot of fun to see the UFC just as it was ready to hit the big time. Highly recommended!",1382918400,,389,4.27027027027027
8357986,4,B0029MY77O,Being a rabid UFC fan these volumes are a great addition to the collection. Although there are no prelims there are plenty of great fights.,1375574400,,139,4.6
8357987,5,B0029MY77O,"This is the best box set out there I would say, except maybe 1-10.
Genki Sudo in the octagon alone makes this worth it, but the number of classic fights in this era are truly staggering.
Lawler vs. Tiki, Lawler vs. Spratt, Hughes vs. Newton, Cabbage vs. Sylvia, Shamrock vs. Tito (Which is the fight that started this whole new UFC revolution if you ask me), Chuck vs. Babablu, the list goes on.
I'd say if you could find it, get it.",1248652800,9,433,4.2926829268292686
