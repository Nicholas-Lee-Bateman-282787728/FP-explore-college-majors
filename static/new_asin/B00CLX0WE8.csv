8583196,2,B00CLX0WE8,The copy is very grainy and poor quality.  Outside shots were especially poor quality transfer.  Very sad to see such poor quality of what once was a great movie about the history of the blade.,1479427200,,193,4.485714285714286
8583197,4,B00CLX0WE8,A very interesting take on the sword related to society and its historical relevance into modern times. The attempt to recreate the lost knowledge of western sword handling really piqued my interest in this form of martial arts.,1447286400,,228,5.026315789473684
8583198,3,B00CLX0WE8,"This documentary is interesting but meybe just a bit long. There is much food for thought in the comparison betwen western &  eastern martials arts, as to why the later enjoy an spiritual reputation while the former was forgotten and reviled as something  only for thugs and cutthroats",1445472000,,285,4.916666666666667
8583199,4,B00CLX0WE8,"Not quite as much about the evolution of swordplay in the movies as I had thought.  It was a very good film to rent, but I would not choose to own it.  The information was very good and the production content well done, just that having seen the movie and understanding the content removed the need to see it again.",1413676800,,315,4.233333333333333
