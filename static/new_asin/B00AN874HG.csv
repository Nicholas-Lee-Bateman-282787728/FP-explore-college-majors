The first DVD covers the basic step, the underarm turn, and the bonus section covers rotation and the disco variation of Nightclub two step. The second and third DVD cover three new patterns each, along with styling tips in the bonus sections. The video quality is good, the instructors speak clearly. If you are a beginner and want to be secure in your dance steps, this is an excellent choice.",1426291200,,451,4.7215189873417724
8554549,5,B00AN874HG,"Okay so we were really hoping to learn more advanced stuff with this set as we already learned the basics with a different DVD.  First off, if you are a beginner, this is the set you want to learn how to nightclub 2-step.  Second, they do indeed teach plenty of advanced level moves plus they really go into a lot of detail on style and how to be a great leader.  Perfect for what we needed, highly recommend.",1399680000,,409,4.217948717948718
