8434504,4,B000FAHWJW,"This is a super set of Pilates videos. I love the locations and the pace.  Both of the hosts are very personable and friendly without being overly happy.
I would have given it 5 stars but some of the editing is a little messy. Nothing major.  A few times they come back from commercial and they are in a different exercise. Another time a set gets skipped on the right leg that they did on the left.  Other than that they are great!
Great product and great price!",1238976000,,463,4.238636363636363
