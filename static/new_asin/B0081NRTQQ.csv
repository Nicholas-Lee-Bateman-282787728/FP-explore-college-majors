8524103,4,B0081NRTQQ,"OK Santo entry.  A Spanish language, Mexican-made sci-fi/adventure involving an invasion by Martians in skimpy outfits and silly wigs and helmets.  It involves the usual plan of invading Earth, changing our way of being, and dominating us.  ONLY Santo can save the day.  I have the RTC DVD release.  Good quality and silly entertainment.",1392595200,,337,5.166666666666667
