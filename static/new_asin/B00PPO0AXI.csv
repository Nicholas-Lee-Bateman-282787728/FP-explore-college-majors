It brings out the romantic charm of Italy and these two unsuspecting strangers fall into its trap. And, talk about a second chance on life. These two capture it! I would give it Academy awards in several categories. The ending is, indeed, a sad one but the viewer will perceive this even from the very beginning. But forge on he/she must because it brings out the romantic in all of us. A simple love story almost made in heaven. And Rachmanioff's second piano concerto is probably one of the most dramatic pieces ever composed and, therefore, provides a proper backdrop. One of the most poignant scenes for me is when Fontaine is practicing at the piano and you can detect the moral conflict that is going on in her head. She plays the Rachmanioff which represents her career ( she is due to play it in a NY concert,) and begins to intertwine it with September Song, (their song,) which results in a perfect and beautiful counterpoint! This just chilled me to the bone! Subtle, yes, but oh so symbolic!!!!  There is similarity with Casablanca,  especially the final scene in both when morality and realism take over at the airports. Compare them; you will agree.  Married folks fall in love; morality wins out. Old school!",1521590400,,1369,4.602459016393443
8688960,5,B00PPO0AXI,"As a music lover and a lover of music and love, I have watched this movie many, many times.  Each time, it seems fresh and new.
Two people from different walks of life suddenly find themselves, through fate and the newspapers, dead.  Being dead, they can
forget their former lives and begin a life together...full of love and romance.  While they are ""dating"", they stop at a restaurant, and
hear the unforgettable and poignant song ""September Song"" song by Walter Huston.
  Joseph Cotton and Joan Fontaine begin an idyllic life with only each other.  Later, we learn that his wife and son come in to the picture, and her music teacher , Francoise Rosay berates her for giving up her concert pianist career.  Eventually, they both realize they must go
back to their own separate lives.  The music by Victor Young is inspiring.  It includes the iconic Rachmaninoff 2nd Piano Concerto.
Two lovers grab their one chance to begin life anew and end up with the life they had before.  This movie is a MUST for all romantics.
all who wish to ""escape"" and all music lovers.  Buy it!!  Love it!!",1427068800,3,1086,4.628272251308901
