8299032,3,B001EO5JMU,"Isaac Asimov was a true genius, extraordinary scholar, explainer and a great entertainer at that!
In this very well prepared (albeit sometimes too stiff) interview you can get to know him just a little bit better (also thanks to the informative biography information at the beginning), alas, the whole programme is just about 25 minutes long, and the Good Doctor talks for about 18 minutes in all. It just leaves you craving for more.
If you are a real Asimov enthusiast and collect all his works and you just can get enough of his views, opinions (mostly on SF) and humour you might consider buying this DVD, otherwise you will be somewhat disappointed.",1250035200,2,654,4.79646017699115
