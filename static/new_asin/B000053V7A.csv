1389799,4,B000053V7A,"The Way of the Gun is one of the years best movies.  The gun scenes in this movie are done with a sense of style all their own, they aren't cliche in any way.  The characters aren't given any backstory which is refreshing, usually the characters get into conversations about how bad their lives were, blah, blah, blah.  The acting is uniformly supurb, Ryan Philippe gives a surprisingly convincing performence and Benicio Del Toro is excellent also.  James Caan in especially solid as the ""bad"" guy in the movie.  The movie is filled with anti-heros and twists, which kept me involved.  The only part of the movie that stumbles on occasion is the dialogue.  While it is excellent throughout most of the movie, at some parts, philosopical voiceovers are heard and the two characters spout off one liners about life.  They are just distracting.  But overall, a very entertaining movie with some of the freshest gun sequences I've seen in a long time.",973036800,,948,4.766871165644171
1389800,5,B000053V7A,"I watched this film with a friend and when it finished all he said was ""What a load of pointlessy violent crap"". I had to disagree as this movie signify's everything that makes violent movies entertaining. The acting is surprisingly good for an action movie and the action scenes are brilliant. If anything the script really lets the movie down, but you'll be so engrossed in the film you won't really notice. Above all though this movie is worth seeing for James Caan's brilliantly calculated performance as an aging hitman. Special mention must be made to the final shootout which has to be one of the most violent shootouts in recent history.",973036800,2,645,4.767857142857143
1389801,5,B000053V7A,"""The Way of the Gun"" was in my opinion one of the great movies this year. Of course, it's difficult to compare it to huge budget movies but, I still think this film was really well done. The story is quite innovative and the cast is really great. Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Philippe did a great job and James Caan is very good as the bagman. The action sequences are also very diverse and always caught my attention, especially the scene with the sniper rifle. Overall, great movie, great story... the only thing is that it seemed the writers didn't have enough time to expand the story enough.",972432000,,593,4.4495412844036695
1389802,4,B000053V7A,"I went into this movie being pretty impartial to everything, I wasn't too hyped, as I sometimes get when I think its going to be good - then my girl laughs in my face when it sucks (i.e. Fight Club)Anyway, I wasn't expecting too much, and came out pretty satisfied... It was pretty gripping at times, a couple loose ends and some confusion, but great acting and some pretty heart-stopping scenes... An all around worthwhile movie to see, if dark humor and crime is your type of flick...",970704000,,486,4.534090909090909
1389803,3,B000053V7A,"When I first saw the TV advertisements for this movie I became very excited, it looked good.  When I finally got around to seeing it I was a little dissapointed at first.  The film has a fair plot with really good acting, but for some reason it leaves you bored most of the time.  The film was like a hollow apple, skin on the outside but nothing inside.  Despite the lack of substance I loved the film.  Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe made an excellent team.
If you've seen and liked ""The Usual Suspects"" (also by Christopher McQuarrie) I think you will enjoy ""The Way of the Gun"".  Both films have a similar use of language and film technique.
If you like a good shootout the film is for you.",970185600,2,699,4.297709923664122
1389804,4,B000053V7A,"I have to say, walking into this film, I was expecting more, but that can only be because of the fine credits of the writer/director.  I mean, of  course you're going to have to expect double and triple crosses and enough  plot twists for ten movies when you go and see a movie from the man who  wrote The Usual Suspects.  However, I have to say that even though I was  at first dissapointed, that quickly went out the window as I got into this  terrific action/noir piece by Christopher McQuarrie.  His barage of bullets  and profanity is some of the best stuff to come out of Hollywood in recent  years.  The story, which I'm not going to spoil, is a work of criminal  genius, and the acting is very good (even Ryan Phillipe!).  This film  crosses Pekinpah's The Wild Bunch with Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid  (through with huge nods are made) and a little bit of 40's noir.  The  two antiheros are by far some of the best written characers in recent  months, and the two actors tacked on to play them are great.  The  supporting cast, which consists of James Caan, Taye Digs, Nicky Katt, and  Juliette Lewis is masterfully crafted and very low key, which is necessary  when trying to make a film of this manner.  There is not a single over the  top performance, which gives a sort of cohesion among the ensemble.  Benicio del Toro gives the films best, and sometimes most hilarious  performance and has been given some of the best lines to work with.  Phillipe actually does a good job with his role, considering how few lines,  besides the narration, that he has.  His boyish charm works perfectly as a  man who doesn't give a damn and is extremely mature for his young  appearance.  To me, the only thing that was lacking in this film was the  direction.  There are too many stationary shots and a little bit too much  of the Pekinpah factor involved in the direction.  There are certain scenes  the scream of The Getaway and The Wild Bunch, along with a little bit of  Straw Dogs' claustrophobia.  The script is top notch and shows how good of  a writer McQuarrie is, especially when you consider that he wrote the film  in five days just to get the corporate monkeys who wanted him to make a  crime film off of his back.  This is the great type of neo-noir action  thriller that will stabalize the genre, but it is sad to read interviews  with McQuarrie in which he says this will be his last foray into the noir  genre.  A talent like his in a genre this hard to work correctly in is  definitely few and far between, and this film will be studied, not for the  direction, but for the always odd plot that drove this film to the great  heights that it reached.",968544000,20,2670,4.393004115226337

I don't remember the transfer quality of the DVD, but the Blu-Ray is excellent. It's a little soft, but I'm pretty sure that was by design. The film isn't quite on par with The Usual Suspects, but it definitely has its twists. I think this definitely qualifies as an action movie, but it has much more depth and style than anything by Michael Bay.",1473292800,,486,4.47191011235955

1390163,3,B000053V7A,"On the surface ""The Way of the Gun"" (2000) looks like a good, offbeat flick. It was written & directed by a proven writer and features a quality cast. In addition, the film is touted as a ""modern Western"" with two protagonists (term used loosely) patterned after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (their names in the film were the last names of Butch & Sundance).

THE PLOT: Two low-life criminals kidnap a pregnant surrogate of a rich couple who, unknowingly, has ties to the mob.

The film starts out as a comedy with cussing every other word and then morphs into a serious crime thriller-drama. The score is likably offbeat.

Two problems hold the film back: (1.) A plot that becomes ridiculously convoluted and therefore increasingly unbelievable, and (2.) unlikable characters, except for maybe the surrogate. Concerning the second fault, I understand the concept of antiheroes, but even antiheroes have to have some redeemable or universally human qualities to make the audience root for them or care about them.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B001GCUO1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;and Clint Eastwood's Western characters, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outlaw-Josey-Wales/dp/B003ASLJRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a>, are good examples, as are the antiheroes in films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runaway-Train-1985-DVD/dp/B00113NWXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runaway Train [1985] [DVD</a>]"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>,"" two cinematic masterpieces. These two problems naturally create disinterest. By the 90 minute mark, with only a half hour to go, I couldn't care less about the characters, their story or how it turned out, even though I really tried.

To the film's credit, it has style and surprising glimpses of depth, but the absurdly convoluted screenplay and unlikable characters sink ""The Way of the Gun.""

The film was shot in Utah.

GRADE: C-",1349395200,,2256,6.898245614035088
1390164,5,B000053V7A,"This is such an awesome, yet underrated movie with a phenomenal cast.  Benicio Del Toro, Ryan Phillipe, Juliette Lewis, Geoffrey Lewis, James Caan, Taye Diggs, and Scott Wilson (most recently of Walking Dead fame) round out a stellar cast and a really cool movie concept.  Parker (Phillipe) and Longbaugh (Del Toro) are the anti-heroes in this movie in which they take on a kidnapping detail only to find out that she (Juliette Lewis) is the surrogate mother for a powerful business man (Wilson) who sends his mercenaries/bodyguards (Diggs included) to retrieve her.  A wicked game of cat and mouse ensues between the kidnappers and the bodyguards all the while James Caan's character attempts a more methodical recovery operation for his boss.

Everyone involved with the storyline are professionals.  Parker and Longbaugh are professional criminals, while Taye Diggs and his crew are professional mercenaries/bodyguards.  James Caan is a professional bag man that has been around the block a few times and probably should have died a few times over, making James Caan's character a total bad ass, although I would expect nonetheless from Mr. Sonny Corleone ;-)

Finally, one thing that I appreciate the most being a former Infantry Marine, is the use of cover and tactics as well as weapons discipline and shot accountability.  Christopher McQuarrie, the writer and director of the movie, hired his brother, who happens to be a Navy SEAL, as a technical advisor for weapons handling and the gun fight scenes.  So I LOVE the use of trigger and weapon discipline (keeping your finger straight and off the trigger until you're ready to fire and never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot), proper room clearing tactics, covering and maneuvering, as well as accountability for all shots fired.  The one exception to that last item is in one of the last scenes/shootouts when Parker and Longbaugh go ape-shit with their shots which, according to the director/writer, was a tribute to shoot 'em up flicks.

A lot of the concepts in this movie are implied and never spoken, so it's easy to get lost with this movie the first time you watch it.  I'll admit I got a little lost the first time I watched it, but when I watched it a second time I was right in the mix with things and the movie just gets better and better each time you watch it.  This movie is well worth the money, so add it to your cart and enjoy!",1345507200,3,2424,4.784172661870503

This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in the last 30 years. I know we all have different tastes and opinions but I will never understand how so many people could conclude that this is a good movie. WOW! Horrible, horrible, horrible.",1334534400,2,364,4.2898550724637685
1390166,4,B000053V7A,"This is an unusual crime thriller in that it is advertised as a sort of comedy, well maybe for some people, whilst it starts with a humorous punch up, the jokes are sparse at best from there on in. The plot is about two crooked drifters who are basically opportunistic in their approach to making a dishonest living. Whilst waiting to sell their `love juice' at a fertility clinic (for three thousand bucks!)they hear about a certain doctor who has an unusual client, an unusual client with lots of money and an important baby on the way.

This client is a wealthy man with dodgy business dealings that require him to have armed protection. His wife is too lazy to have a child for him, so they have chosen the surrogacy route. For a million in cash Robin (Juliette Lewis) is carrying his son. She is nine months gone, and our two heroes Mr Parker (Ryan Philippe) and Mr Longbaugh (Benicio del Toro) decide to kidnap her. That is when it all kicks off with car chases and plenty of gun play and oodles of intrigue.

This is more than a shoot out fest in that it has some well observed humour in a gallows sort of way. The plot is far from straight forward; in fact it almost feels contrived the further into it you go, just one coincidence too many I was thinking. However it all seems to work. We have real guns that actually run out of bullets (for a change) and when people get hit they hurt and or bleed. All of the supporting cast are brilliant, we have one guy who plays Russian Roulette with himself, the bagman is James Caan who puts in a compelling performance as a man who has out lived any real intrigue life can throw at him. Both Philippe and del Toro are as ever great value for money, but it is Juliette Lewis who pulls out all the stops and manages to steal more than one scene.

The plot has more twists than an Alpine road and enough action to keep most folk glued to their seat. It is just over an hour and a half so just right in timing; I think Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay for `The Usual Suspects') has made a film to be proud of. Gutsy without the glitz, action without the showing off and a real examination of peoples psyche, this one is hard to categorize, but great to watch.",1328400000,,2207,4.313253012048193

1390221,3,B000053V7A,"""Way of the Gun"" was directed by Christopher McQuarrie who has the film ""Valkyrie"" coming out soon.  I found the subject matter brutal, more than one would expect from the title.

Dylan Kussman does an excellent job as Dr. Allen Painter, who is the son of the crime boss and has to operate to save his own baby in non-sterile conditions with bullets flying.  One of the best scenes in the film is when he reaches in his bag & gives Taye Diggs' character a surprise.

Ryan Phillippe who has been in some high profile films like ""Cruel Intentions"" (1999), ""Gosford Park"" (2001), & ""Crash"" (2004), plays Mr. Parker, the criminal who appears is not smart enough to analyze why he is a criminal.  He does question some about God and shows sympathy to his kidnapping victim, but it leaves for a bit of confusion as to what makes Parker tick.  The scene with the glass shards truly made me cringe.

Benicio Del Toro won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Traffic"" (2000) & was also nominated for ""21 Grams"" (2003).  He has the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation.  His characters including Mr. Longbaugh in this film always seem to have depth, something held behind the lines to make us wonder what lurks beneath the surface.

Sarah Silverman isn't in the film long, but she makes a full force frontal assault as the character called Raving B*tch.""

James Caan does strong work as Joe Sarno who tracks the bad guys and is a bad guy himself.  Geoffrey Lewis shines in his appearance as Abner Mercer who assists Sarno and winds up wounded in a taxi cab.  It is probably one of the more humorous death scenes you're likely to see.  Nicky Katt who started out on an episode of ""Fantasy Island"" and has been in numerous films including 2007's ""Grindhouse"" teams with Taye Diggs to assist Sarno.  He turns in a strong performance.  Taye Diggs plays Jeffers who is the lead gunman for hire.  Diggs has built a strong career including recurring or regular TV performances on shows ""Ally McBeal,"" ""Kevin Hill,"" ""Will & Grace,"" ""Day Break,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"" & ""Private Practice.""  For me, he never really had the cold-blooded look in his eye.

Last but not least is Juliette Lewis.  She was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1991 for ""Cape Fear"" and won the Best Actress award from the Venice International Film Festival for ""Natural Born Killers"" in 1994.  Lewis always seems to play characters who are off-center, a bit crazy or loaded.  As the pregnant surrogate mom Robin, she moves full-steam with one screw loose making one never quite know what she's going to do.  With an unusual rasp in her voice, she is a distinctive actress.

I found this film in the $4 budget bin and figured it was cheaper than a rental.  I'm glad to have the seen performances.  The cinematography was excellent.  I haven't quite decided whether to keep the DVD or put it in the garage sale pile.  Enjoy!",1210896000,4,2922,4.6104651162790695
1390222,3,B000053V7A,"Written and directed by the scriptwriter of the excellent The Usual Suspects, Way of the Gun has a conventional plot, lots of shoot 'em up action, and a number of lines which will stick with you for days.

The best thing to say about the movie is that it stars two strong actors in del Toro and Caan.  Sadly, most of the rest of the cast is doomed to playing caricatures and not characters.  del Toro and Caan are excellent.  Their conversation inside the cantina half way through the movie suffuses with poignant regret.  The two men learn quickly that in another time and place, they might have been friends.  However, the circumstances they're in place them irrevocably at odds. Although reprehensible people, the viewer starts to care about them.

Not so for the other characters.  They either play set-cast roles largely there to keep the plot moving or they deliver performances as if they were walking through their lines hoping to get quickly to the other side (the actor playing the second gunman is the epitome of this problem.)

There are some odds quirks about this movie to like.  Seldom will one see an inability to get a cellular signal play such a repeated or important role in plot development.  There's a very slow motion chase scene in an alley which is photographed beautifully.  The use of vivid colors at night in Mexico is visually arresting.

The Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid rip-offs (excuse me, *homages*) are apparent at points throughout, but especially obvious at the end.

What a thematic mess.  Don't have the main character give us the phony voice-over telling us he's not interested in redemption, after protecting a pregnant mother from ruthless mobsters for no other possible reason than to try to redeem himself from a life of killing and grifting.  Don't try to have your protagonists be both the heroes and anti-heroes at the same time.  Be one or the other.

1390224,3,B000053V7A,"Kinda sounds like a martial arts movie set in the Old West. Actually, it was a rather strange movie directed and written by the guy who wrote the screenplay for The Usual Suspects. But unlike The Usual Suspects, this lackluster film failed to deliver.

The cast was even more diverse than Suspects, if that is even possible. Ryan Philippe, Benicio del Toro, and Juliette Lewis were the headliners, with a cast rounded out by Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt, and James Caan. Caan's performance was the one diamond in this coal mine of acting drivel. He rarely fails to deliver stellar, well-nuanced characters. Taye Diggs is not believable as a bodyguard. He is a model, not an actor. Del Toro gives us his typical one-dimensional character that we've seen a thousand times, and Philippe's accent was absolutely dreadful (watch Matt Damon if you want real Boston). Lewis, typically strong (i.e. Natural Born Killers), was a little disappointing in her role as a surrogate mother for doting multi-millionaire parents.

The storyline is basically two cons (del Toro and Philippe) who abandon their typical money-making schemes (sperm donation, etc) to pursue a more lucrative idea by kidnapping the surrogate of a millionaire. After watching the first gunfight (guns galore, thus the title), one really begins to wonder where these two get their skills from. Two cons that have to jack-off to make ends meet typically don't have the elite skills of the top Army Rangers in tactical weaponry. But these two are obviously gifted in S.W.A.T. Remarkably, it becomes even more surreal as these two lead the skilled bodyguards of the surrogate down alleyways in intricate cat and mouse play that even Jerry and the Road Runner would be envious of.

A potentially intricate plot is heavily diluted by a poorly written script and even worse directing. I don't think this film is worthy of being in the same review as The Usual Suspects, much less being on its cover. This film was a good idea, but poorly executed.",1173139200,5,1994,4.928571428571429

Haha That's simply hilarious. In fact, the opening scene is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. It's even instructional. If you are a loud-mouthed wench, there is no way a boyfriend that looks like a meth-addicted Carrot Top is going to protect you from getting your face caved in. In addition, it's the perfect response from someone confronted with that situation: Punch the person talking the most trash. Punch them fast, hard, without warning, and repeatedly.

The Way of the Gun is a story of two hustlers - Mr. Parker (Ryan Phillipe) and Mr. Longbow (Benecio Del Toro) - that deliver or elicit some of the best lines in movie history. I've never killed a man. Nobody brings up sex with dead people! Brilliant. Juliette Lewis is having a surrogate baby for a rich guy and his wife, and she might as well be a walking goldmine for two losers that make their way through life by selling blood, plasma, and semen. What follows is a story of abduction, betrayal, all sorts of gun-play, and more surprise twists and turns than most movies that claim to be suspenseful.

The heart of the movie is the drama and tension between all parties. James Caan and others as bagmen haunting and hunting every move made by Parker and Longbow are very convincing. It really has the feel of a true gangster movie; and if it had had a cast with more notoriety, I feel it would have been a much larger success.

Overall, it's a fairly good movie that keeps a viewer interested.",1152835200,,1628,4.568493150684931
1390228,4,B000053V7A,"Does this movie compare to THE USUAL SUSPECTS?

Does it matter?

Anyone brilliant enough to write the screenplay for SUSPECTS must have more than one movie in him, and McQuarrie proves he does with this.  Some reviewers remarked about how he doesn't make you care for the characters in his film.  And I think they missed the point: you're not supposed to.  McQuarrie figures out how to make you enjoy watching them without either caring about them or being totally replused by them.  He achieves a sacred principle of both writing and directing--making it a lot easier on even great actors like Del Toro and James Caan: freeing you from existential judgment or the self-referentialness lessor screen writers can fall into.  This creates room for the nilhist philosophy and betrayal that competes with anything that can be called deep and abiding love whereever it occurs in this film.

EVERYONE in this movie is a ""bag man;"" even the unborn children.  As such McQuarrie is saying something pretty deep about the modern world in total.  And yet he does it in the context of not boring us to tears with preaching or burdening our minds with too much philosophy, pertinent or otherwise.  All while giving us some of the most innovative car chases and shoot-em-up action scenes done in some time.

This movie came out in 2000, and to see how the actors have evolved since then is refreshing and exhilharating all by itself. Caan looks about ten years younger in the successful NBC-TV show LAS VEGAS of today than he does in this movie; showing off, obviously, the prodigious acting skills that forever remind us that THE GODFATHER was no fluke.  (He is acting older and more beat down in this movie than he probably ever has been.)  Every actor puts in some serious work in this, and make it worth seeing, and worth owning.  And McQuarrie's writing and directing make it worth thinking about afterwards.",1128470400,24,1899,4.782208588957055

This is not light-hearted stuff, it's almost solemn. i found it to be more interesting than the massively over-rated USUAL SUSPECTS.

1390250,4,B000053V7A,"Within the 5 minutes of the Way of the Gun, after a severe assault of swear words, followed by the all out malee in the parking lot of the Dive Bar in L.A., we are introduced to the main characters, Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh. Little known to watchers and not at all elluded to in any way through the course of the film, Parker and Longbaugh were the real surnames of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; two outlaws always on the lookout for a quick, and illegal, way to make money. This is what we see with Way of the Gun's Parker (Ryan Phillipe) and Longbaugh (Benecio de Toro), two drifters and petty criminals, modern day Butch and Sundance in an up for anything, make money any way possible to survive. And set with the backdrop of the Mexican desert and mountains, and the musical score, which sounds like something straight off of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (writer of The Usual Suspects)sets the stage for a modern day western, a updated cowboy film about money, greed, loyalty, and family, in many senses of the word. Even the title sounds like the name of a Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, or Sam Elliot movie.

The film is filled to the brim with exciting shootouts; an old western-style standoff within the confines of a Mexican hacienda-like hotel, complete with a saloon and fountain filled with dust and sharp turns. The movie is also bullet-riddled with a good lines and a well-written narrative, spoken in full by Mr. Parker. Twists and turns, hard men softening their mentality long enough to reload their metaphorical six-shooters, and the pitting of young and reckless against old and seasoned, dialogue and bullet-wise, all fill the just near 2 hours of this greatly unique film. Fans of the modern day shoot 'em up and the classic western standoff will be pleased with this film, where irony, chance, and fate rule as undertones to the overtone of the modern-day western.",1112227200,7,1935,4.724852071005917
1390251,4,B000053V7A,"You know, for someone that was voted one of `The 25 Future Powers under 35' by Premiere Magazine, Christopher McQuarrie seems to have fallen off the radar recently, with The Way of the Gun (2000) being his last film, which is too bad as I think he has a really good sense of how to tell a story in a unique and interesting way.  Along with writing the film, McQuarrie also makes his directorial debut.  Appearing in the film is quite a cast (perhaps drawn by the siren song of working on a project by the person responsible for highly popular The Usual Suspects) in James Caan (Misery), Benicio Del Toro (The Usual Suspects), and Ryan Phillippe (I Know What You Did Last Summer), along with Taye Diggs (Chicago), Juliette Lewis (Cold Creek Manor), Geoffrey Lewis (Salem's Lot), and Scott Wilson (In the Heat of the Night).

The film starts with an exercise to see how much profanity can be crammed into the first two minutes.  If there ever were a contest for such a thing, The Way of the Gun would surely rank.  Once we get past that, we meet two individuals in Longbaugh (Del Toro) and Parker (Phillippe).  They appear to be a couple of grifter types, surviving on the fringe of the system, collecting money where they can, including, but not limited to, donating baby batter, which is where they conceive (pardon the pun) an idea to kidnap a pregnant woman (Lewis) and hold her for ransom.  Turns out the woman is a surrogate mother, and her benefactors, the soon-to be recipients of the unborn babe, are going to pay the woman one million dollars once the transaction is completed, so the duo figure they got some very deep pockets.  Oh yeah, she's also constantly by bodyguards, which probably cost a pretty penny.  The plan goes off, but not without a hitch as a gun battle between the duo and the bodyguards ensues, but they eventually do make off with the woman, only to learn the surrogate father is a rich and powerful figure linked to various underworld elements, and has no problem in using such elements to avoid any nasty entanglements with the police.  One of these elements is Joe Sarno (Caan), essentially a bagman (a person who collects money, as for racketeers), but also someone who has a unique interest in the events so far, much more so than just performing a task assigned to him by his employer.  As the once duo, now a trio (a foursome, if you count the unborn baby) head south of the border (that's Mexico to you and me, pard), things get really complicated as certain aspects of certain relationships are revealed, leaving this viewer to often time be left scratching his head, not so much out of the need to relieve an itch, but in a bewildered sense, as confusion settled in...but never fear, things do sort themselves out in their own, sweet time, at least enough to stop me from scratching my head and move on to other parts of my anatomy...(ain't thet a pretty picture)

Now let me say upfront, I'm wary of writers who also want to direct.  It's not uncommon, as they feel that's the best way to translate their vision to celluloid, and sometimes it works well, but that's not always the case.  In his previous two films, Public Access (1993) and The Usual Suspects, the directing chores were assigned to Bryan Singer (X-Men), and while I haven't yet seen Public Access, The Usual Suspects was a o fun (Singer is currently working on the new Superman movie, scheduled to be released in 2006, with Kevin Spacey to appear as Lex Luthor...does anyone remember Spacey's cameo as Dr. Evil in the last Austin Powers film?).  I did enjoy the film, but I felt there were really no standout performances.  It was almost like the story overshadowed the characters.  Phillippe and Del Toro's characters seemed to be the main ones early on, but they soon became peripherals as the story progressed.  As far as Caan's character goes, it isn't like we haven't seen him do virtually the same character he's done many times before..and then there's Juliette Lewis...I don't really care for her as an actress that much, as I tire of the waifish idiot routine, and imagine that same routine except now she's waddling around, about to spew forth a baby.  She actually does well, and I give her agent a ton a credit as he/she/they have kept her working continuously, with five films scheduled for release in 2005.  While I did enjoy the film a lot, I thought McQuarrie got a little too cutesy with the dialogue at some points, and maybe he himself realized this as there's one scene featuring one of the characters making fun of the way another talks.  The pacing of the story felt a little odd, as the beginning starts out with a lot of action, then wanes throughout the middle, finishing up stronger than it began.  The plot proceeds in a linear fashion, but the details involving the characters do not, as bits of crucial information are revealed when McQuarrie deemed necessary.  This results in confusion and sometimes frustration, but he doesn't leaving you hanging too much, as things become clear near the end.  I respect his ability to visualize telling a tale in this manner, as if I tried to do it, I would mess things up horribly, constantly tripping over my own plot threads.  All in all, there's lots of gunplay, lots of blood, smart performances, smart writing, and an entertaining film.

The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture (enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs) looks sharp, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is clear.  Special features include a commentary track by the director and composer, an isolated music track featuring commentary by the composer, storyboards and script of a deleted scene, production notes, and biographies with video interviews with the cast.

1390253,5,B000053V7A,"First off if you're considering buying this movie, definitely read at least three pages of the reviews here and more if possible.  You'll get a good feel of the film that way.  Some folks get this movie and some have no clue at all.

I'm just going to add some comments that are lacking or that have been mis-stated.

First, only in the most loose definition of plot twists or subplots, does this film have either.  The story is entirely linear, however you have to piece together parts of the story from sparse information.  The story begins at least 9 months prior to when the movie starts with the relationship and ""deal"" between the bagman and the surrogate mother (but you don't know this until nearly the end and it's subtle enough to miss).  The film story fully begins with the kidnapping.  From that point on the various antagonists all see opportunities and then angle to make it happen, except for the bagman who is protecting more than his employer.

Second, this is not about petty crooks and a botched job.  This is a story that involves professional criminals, professional mobsters and professional bodyguards, all of whom show clarity and intelligence beyond typical clever, one-liner, hollywood scripting.

The fact that police are only peripherally involved in any part of the film simply indicates that the dealings are far beyond your average cops and robbers style movie.  This is a subculture that is not visible to normal society.  The dialogue between Longbaugh and Sarno should illustrate this nicely. There is an understanding between them that goes well beyond the simple words.  This is equally true for the relationship between Longbaugh and Parker, and Sarno and Abner - much is conveyed but little is said.  This is a product of excellence in both acting and directing.

Lastly, the viewer is conflicted by the characters.  Bodyguards should be good guys, but are not sympathetic and are really just mercenary.  Chidduck is a bad person, but is the only person with a good intent.  Longbaugh, Parker and Sarno are criminals pure and simple, but can be sympathetic.  All of these characters show that the line between good/evil, or honor/dishonor, or morality, etc is a very blurry line, and one that the characters cross over without regret.  There are no absolutes.

This is good script writing, because that does not happen by sheer good fortune.

One last thought.  I feel that this film is better than the Usual Suspects.  Simply because I think the Way of the Gun is more believable and more steeped in reality.  The Usual Suspects to me was clever but ultimately a fantasy.",1102464000,42,2611,4.850678733031674
1390254,4,B000053V7A,"This freshman effort by writer/director McQuarrie deserves a look, especially if one likes the 'caper gone wrong' sub-genre.  It ranks with scuh films as 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Sexy Beast', 'Confidence' and 'The Hot Rock' (but not quite as good as Pulp Fiction).  Although the secretive interconnectedness of the characters is pretty easy to decipher -it will be impossible to ascertain their fates.  Moreover, there is no authentic protagonist in the film (even Philippe and Del Toro cannot be thought of as your average run-of-the-mill 'anti-heros').  McQuarrie really seems to channel Peckinpah in establishing the overall mood of the film (particularly with the 'Mexican-standoff' scene and with the ridiculously violent, funny, and extremely profane opening.  Also, if you're are a fan of 'bells' and 'whistles' that DVDs have over VHS, the extra features option enables the viewer to witness a never filmed storyboard scene you'd wish they had actually put on film.",1092009600,4,987,5.383116883116883
1390255,1,B000053V7A,"""The Way Of The Gun"" was written, and actually directed by the writer of the great ""The Usual Suspects"", so this has to be good, right?.

 In this movie, we can see good actors like James Caan and Benicio Del Toro, so this has to be good, right?.

 Also, we can find actors that appear in some good movies like Ryan Philippe in ""Gosford Park"" and Juliette Lewis in ""Cape Fear"" and ""Natural Born Killers"", so this has to be good, right?.

 The answer to those previous questions is the same: WRONG, VERY WRONG!!.

 ""The Way Of The Gun"" is supposed to be a very clever film, with exciting plot twists, like those we saw in ""The Usual Suspects"", but is merely a pretty poor movie, with half baked ideas, with an awful screenplay, horrible direction, mediocre performances by almost every person in this so-called ""movie"", only the great James Caan and Benicio Del Toro are tolerable on this thing, but they show only a very small percentage of their acting talent.

 Ryan Philippe and Juliette Lewis deliver perhaps their worst performances of their lives, and with Ryan Philippe that's saying a lot; in this thing, Juliette Lewis overacts 99% of the time, she is supposed to be a pregnant woman, but she screams like she is being tortured by Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition; where is the talented young actress we saw in ""Cape Fear""?, gone forever...perhaps. And Ryan Philippe is a horrible actor, for every 10 bad movies he makes, he delivers only one decent performance; of course ""The Way Of The Gun"" isn't the decent one.

 The story is very poor and senseless, 10 minutes after the ridiculous opening scene you are through with this silly and pretentious film; the characters are so poorly developed and are so stupid, that they make look the character Kelso from the TV sitcom ""That 70's Show"" like a super-genius that will discover the cure for the AIDS illness.

 If you are looking for an entertaining movie, look somewhere else; a race between a couple of snails is 1000 times better than seen this pathetic ""movie"".

 Mr. McQuarrie, instead of trying to be a ridiculous imitation of Quentin Tarantino, please stick to your writer's abilities and write another script as good as the one you did in ""The Usual Suspects"", not trash like this.",1091750400,12,2255,4.699745547073792

As presented, the story was very hard to follow not only in terms of cohesiveness but also in being able to keep my interest.  I only watched it to the end out of sheer curiosity.

She goes on a horrific tirade, until Phillipe becomes fed up and punches her in the face.  It's probably the only cinematic example of this common phenomena--loud girls starting fights that their reluctant boyfriends have to carry out; but it's subverted wonderfully.  However, everything is downhill from this initial colorful scene.

Pacing needs to be picked up some it tends to drag at points,I think sometimes its due to a lack of intresting dialogue or a real slow down to the narrative thread where we don't want a slow down.

Usually when good actors like Phillipe, Del Toro, and Caan come together, the finished product is one of greatness. Well, not here folks.
I did not care about ONE of these characters. Not one. I never sympathized once with any of them. The criminals are stupid. I never really cared if they succeeded and got the money, or if they died in the next scene. The bodyguards of the wealthy man act like robots. Their dialogue seems forced, and, also ....robotic. Although she plays a very convincing pregnant lady, Julliette Lewis doesn't provide much. Long, pointless, dragged-out gun scenes plague the movie. Usually gun fights are cool, but I wasn't impressed. To all you reviewers who are giving this movie 5 stars...I ask, ""WHY?!""  There are so many better films than this out there, with  better storylines and acting. This movie is not good. Plain and simple. And can Del Toro get any uglier?

The Way of the Gun (WoG)is most definately one of my favorite movies, not for it's over use of Colt 1911's or the amazing gun fight sequences, but for the religious and societal meanings laced throughout the film.  Ryan Phillippe speaks of god and mercy with Benicio Del Toro, and Del Toro replies with, ""I'm gonna tell him I was Framed,"" upsetting Phillippe, but in the end, Phillippe doesn't know what he has to say in his defense.
Let's not forget the societal statements of this movie, it's based on the concept that money equals happiness.  Phillippe and Del Toro believe this and kidnap Julliete Lewis, a surigate mother, in hopes to collect on a ransom from the millionare parents of the baby.
But the plan doesn't play out and plot twist after plot twist end with blood shed and suprises.  But the only way to actually know what happened and who did what, the film must be viewed multiple times.

1390283,4,B000053V7A,"This is a great action film. Reviewers have often seemed disappointed by this film, as they were expecting another plot and character heavy movie like The Usual Suspects (which came from the same Director/Writer).  I much prefer this film. For me, The Usual Suspects was too smart by half. Throughout the film I kept imagining a writer patting himself on the back for his brilliance. This is a much leaner and meaner piece of work. The basic plot is simplicity itself: a couple of low-level criminals kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother, who is carrying the child of a crime boss. The two demand a ransom, of course. Plot, however, is not what makes this film very, very good.
 Director, McQuarrie, set out to create a sort of homage to the great, classic action films of the 1960's, and he has done a great job. Movies like The Getaway and Bullitt were films that were neither plot nor character driven, but driven instead by a tremendous feel for action and violence. Guns and intimidation set the pace of these films, and it sets the pace for The Way of the Gun.
That is not to say that the film is without good acting and writing.  The dialogue is chocked full of great lines, and all concerned give very good performances. For me, the standout performances come from the old dogs: Scott Wilson, who plays rich patriarch Hale Chidduck is great to watch. Wilson has had a long and terribly underrated career, and he turns in another great supporting character role here, full of a smooth calmness that barely overlays a quivering fury. James Caan matures very nicely as Joe Sarno,  aging body guard and go-to guy for Hale Chidduck; and finally Geoffrey Lewis plays Abner Mercer, an old pro sidekick to Caan and very handy with a gun (if you don't know Lewis's name, you should. I guarantee you will recognize his face).
The young dogs do nicely, too. Benicio Del Toro is hypnotic as usual and Taye Diggs is surprisingly effective as a professional gunny hired to protect and retrieve the surrogate mother. Juliette Lewis is on hand to supply the only negative in the picture, once again proving she has the God-given gift to be annoying and overact.
I recommend this film highly if you long for the days when film makers weren't so tricky and cute and realized that violent action was as viable an engine for a film as plot quirks or arty dialogue.",1055376000,3,2350,4.628297362110311
1390284,5,B000053V7A,"I reluctantly went to the theater with my husband to see ""The Way of the Gun"" as it was his turn to pick a film to see. I'm not your usual chick-flick kinda chick, I really appreciate good films that keep my attention and leave me wanting to talk about it afterwards (in a positive way! re: ""Signs"" *shudder*).
I'll admit that the title had me a bit set against it, and surely the first scene of the movie also turned me off as it was completely pointless and should have been cut from the film entirely. After that, however, is where it really begins.
I won't get into plot specifics as I see many reviews have touched on that aspect already. The first action scene where the kidnapping occured blew me away. It was unlike ANY scene I had ever seen in a film. It set the tone for the entire movie to have intense emotional drama without noise, without running or shooting blindly. It showed that these two criminals were a step above your average thug or person who ""is more interested in being a criminal than wanting to commit a crime"". The bodyguards also prooved to be a step above your typical bouncer thug, but rather very well trained men who entered the profession for it's strategic and competitive appeal.
I loved the old man who was hiding behind the motel with the cel-phone that just wouldn't operate. He cracked me up all the way through with the odd russian roulete to the silliest death scene ever to be shot. Him and the main Bag Man had womderful dialoge and set the tone for his obvious wisdom and experience in the life of a hitman. I liked how the older gentlemen were depicted as wise, and not as bumbling old coots.
I did not understand one part of this plot. What did Dr. Painter do? Something with an abortion? Huh?
I enjoyed the dialogue emmensely, and perhaps this is why it's appealing to women and men because it doesn't assume that you the viewer is a mindless dingleberry who is easliy bored by interesting plot and character development *ahem!*",1055116800,11,1977,4.464088397790055

One of my favorite aspects of the film is the dialogue.  This movie is full of memorable expressions; its one of the most quoteable films out there.  The dialogue is short and concise, and the characters manage to carve themselves out within it.  But thats not whats so remarkable about it.  The cool part is, half the dialogue is unspoken. Most of the time the two protagonists don't even speak to each other, the communicate with demeanor, not so much facial expressions and body language, but they make it clear to each other and the audience exactly what they're saying, wordlessly.
The ending may be predictable, but the closing monologue, like the rest of the script, is fantastic.  And i wonder how many of you people who didn't like it, and even those who did, know whats really going on in the film.  Theres a backstory here thats never quite revealed, but is fairly obvious.

1390287,4,B000053V7A,"It's a Western disguised as a modern-day gangster film.  It is the code of the gunslinger laid upon the backbone of the code of the Bushido, the way of the samurai.
Director Christopher McQuarrie has written and directed an ultra-violent story of two veteran criminals placed in a position where morality is the path to their golden ticket and not a multi-million dollar ransom.  Played ably by Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe, the two anti-heroes kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) carrying a baby associated to a mob family.  Pursued by the elements of the mob (James Caan, Taye Diggs) the story crescendos into a Mexican standoff true to the theme of the film.  ""The Way Of The Gun"" holds little back in the regards of violence.  The style is reminiscent of ""The Wild Bunch"", and the gun play feels real.
In the first few moments of ""The Way Of A Gun"", pay particular attention to the music.  True fans of the Western genre and of Spaghetti Westerns in particular will recognize the tell-tale signs of a Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone signature tune.  In the final showdown in a rundown Mexican brothel, Christopher McQuarrie has replicated the Spanish fountain plaza setting from the climax in Leone's ""A Fistful Of Dollars"".
McQuarrie is paying homage to the themes of redemption and salvation of anti-heroes portrayed so emphatically in the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s, and also in the Japanese ronin-chambara films made famous by samurais played by Toshiro Mifune (Sanjuro) and Shintaro Katsu (Zaitoichi) in the 1960s.  When Del Toro and Phillippe break their criminal code and sacrifice their escape for their kidnapped victim, much like Eastwood in Leone's ""Dollar"" movies and Mifune in Kurosawa's ""Sanjuro"" series, the good deeds of bad men go punished.  Such sacrifice shows honor and courage.  This is the way of the gun, the way of the samurai.  Death before dishonor.",1046649600,8,1901,4.965299684542587

It tells the story of two really stupid hoodlums who kidnap a girl who turns out to be surrogate mother for a big-time mobster, and naturally, his henchmen are determined to get this pregnant mother back.  And they far outnumber these two stupid guys in brains AND firepower.  And the girl has a secret of her own that makes her even more dangerous.
But are these guys as stupid as they seem?  Are they as ruthless?  It's hard to tell.  And that is part of the fun.  The two hoods are played by Ryan Phillipe, who is the very occasional voice-over narrator of the film, and thus it's hero, I suppose.  But his partner is played by Benicio del Toro, and he's GREAT.  What a great look this guy has.  His hair and burning eyes.  He does ""still waters run deep"" very well.
On the other side of the fence, we've got James Caan as the chief ""bag man"" for the mobster, and he's very good as well.  Weary but dangerous, that's him.  Taye Diggs is a young bodyguard who has a few secrets of his own.  Juliette Lewis (perhaps a little less annoying than usual) is the girl with the baby and the secret.
The scenes of gunplay are simple but fun.  If you like your action scenes to involved lots of bullets flying and people just flat out shooting at each other, you'll be happy.  It's all stylishly done, especially the grande finale in a cheap, Mexican hotel/cathouse.  Lots of adobe flying everywhere, lots of great music in the background.
The movie really gets by on mood, and the fascinating Del Toro, with solid help from Caan and Phillipe.

I'm talking about intense gun battles where main characters do not necessarily have the usual ""immunity"" to bullets as the plot goes by.  Judged by this alone, if you like these kind of sequences, and they are very well done, then this is your kind of movie.
Of course they have to wrap a plot around it, and to their credit, they do populate the movie with credible stars.  Best of the bunch is James Caan, who shows a weariness as a veteran mob enforcer who has probably been through a hundred shootouts.  Taye Diggs is good as the modern day version of Caan, all business suits and corporate behavior, unlike the street-smarts of Caan.  We expect Benecio del Toro to act appropriately as a thug, but pretty boy Ryan Phillipe does do a good job playing someone with a self-imposed ""nothing to lose"" mentality.
While not critically important to many viewers, there is a plot, and it also involves a good performance.  Juliette Lewis is arguably the centerpoint of the movie, as a surrogate mom for a wealthy couple.  She gets kidnapped by two of the above actors, and held for ransom.  In some ways, it's a thankless role, as she has to waddle around looking nine months pregnant for the whole movie, and ready to give birth at any minute.  The movie teases you in making you wonder if she really doesn't mind the kidnapping as an out to keep the baby she's mentally bonded with for herself.
For those that want plot, there's enough there to keep the cerebral view interested, but this is a well-done action movie for the afficionado of well-done action movies.",1034553600,2,1678,4.581939799331104

Benicio Del Toro's and Juliette Lewis's performances are excellent and the rest of the cast include the always surprising James Caan, Taye Diggs and Ryan Phillippe as Benicio's pal.
A well-known critic once says that in every movie there are at least five minutes of pure cinema that justify the eighty-five other minutes you lose in front of your TV. If you take this affirmation for granted, THE WAY OF THE GUN is a masterpiece. Because several scenes of the movie are, in my opinion, worthy to be praised if you are a movie lover. Take Juliette's delivery in the middle of a gunfight  la Sam Peckinpah, for instance. Absolutely improbable but the scene is cinema at its highest level.
Another scene of anthology is the car chase with its moments of quiet observation and sudden violence. A lot more impressive than all the BULLITT-like car chases featured in today movies. In short, you'll find in THE WAY OF THE GUN all what you've appreciated in the first creative period of Quentin Tarantino. Suspense, surprises, creativity. Plus the brain.

My teammates and I were surprised to see some very accurate technical aspects of gunfighting in this movie.  As an armed professional and SWAT officer, I found the weapons handling, tactical movement, and verbiage of the protagonists and the two executive protection pursuers to be fairly accurate.  Most such films are rife with technical errors and sloppy weapons handling and movement.  One of my closest friends and teammates is a former SEAL and he too was surprised by the accuracy in the tactics and gunfighting scenes.  A little research revealed that the technical advisor for this film is the writer/director's brother and he is also a former SEAL.  Clearly, this explains the refreshing technical accuracy which is so often missing from other films.  Without getting too detailed, the actors demonstrate weapons handling skills, team movements, and verbiage that would only be done by somebody with professional training.  This may interfere with the story-line for some hardcore film critics, it only goes to reinforce a professional's enjoyment of the film.  While not tactically or technically ""perfect,"" this movie depicts what just may be the most realistic gunfight scene ever filmed.  It's too bad that many people (like my wife) do not appreciate this.

There are a few slow spots in the movie but they are critical for character and plot development.  The Way of the Gun is a cross between ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Heat.""  This film is not a ""date movie"" nor is it something that your wife or girlfriend is likely to enjoy.  If you want fairly realistic, modern gunfighting techniques mixed with a western-style gritty crime story, then this movie is for you.",1017532800,16,1755,5.027681660899654

Second there is Juliette Lewis who does nothing but scream throughout the entire film (she is probably still screaming after seeing this film). Third this movie feels as though it will never end. It goes on and on and on. It's redundant. It goes on and on and on. It's redundant.
Seriously, if gun violence for the sake of gun violence appeals to you, you need to seriously evaluate your repressed emotions and stay away from this film.",1017273600,8,593,4.5514018691588785
1390326,4,B000053V7A,"Christopher McQuarrie deservedly won an Oscar a few years ago for his screenplay for The Usual Suspect. Not only did he pen the script for The Way of the Gun, he also chose the movie as his first directing effort. The result is not a great American film, but I do not feel, as some critics do, that it is a bad one. Most of the negative reviews concentrated on the violence in the movie, as if the level of it was unexpected. The fact is that The Usual Suspects was also quite violent. Guns, mayhem and macho misadventures are McQuarrie's stock in trade to date. The title itself should have been a warning. What sets him apart is his creative, twisted plot devices and his way-above-average dialog.
The story is dark and nihilistic. Parker [Ryan Phillipe] states at the beginning that he and his partner, Longbaugh [Benicio del Toro] are misfits whose only reason for existing is to survive. The pair learns of a wealthy, ruthless businessman who is paying a woman $1,000,000 to bear a child for him and is wife, simply because the wife does not want to go through pregnancy herself. The resourceful Parker and Longbaugh hatch a plan to kidnap the mother and unborn child and hold them for ransom. The scheme is fairly well thought out, but the men do not take into account the people they are dealing with. The businessman, Chidduck [Scott Wilson], has in his employ two bodyguards who do not like to lose. He also knows a hit man who he has used on several occasions. Parker and Longbaugh barely manage to capture their victim. Keeping her is no easy task, and getting the ransom is certainly problematic. None of the players in this cat and mouse game play by the rules. The result is quite a guessing game for the audience.
This is Ryan Phillipe's best role and performance to date. Like Brad Pitt, Phillipe's great acting abilities are hindered by a face that is just too pretty. He will probably have to prove himself over and over again. Benicio del Toro, who is also talented, does not have the pretty boy problem. Ironically, this fact will probably confine him to character actor status. Juliette Lewis does her best in the role of the victim, but it is a thankless part. It is difficult to play a woman nine months pregnant, much less one who is being held by two admitted sociopaths.
The Way of the Gun is one of those movies that people tend either to like or to loathe. I am one who liked it, despite its flaws, yet I can understand why it could repel many viewers. I don't think that this is because of the level of violence, which is high but not extraordinarily so by current standards. I think it is because the story and its characters are so nihilistic and because the movie strikes a chord in American society. We are schizophrenic in our view of handguns and assault rifles. The majority of us believe we have a right to own them but are appalled that some people use them for their intended purpose. The Way of the Gun suggests that we might be trying to have our cake and eat it too.",1016323200,2,3008,4.470909090909091
1390327,4,B000053V7A,"Okay first thing first, this is a movie you have to pay attention to or you will get lost.  So take heed, when watching Way of the Gun, put on your thinking cap.  If you do so, it's a awesome movie to watch, the plot is super slick, the action is great and all the characters are fun to watch and see how they interact with one another.  The only downfall I did see to this movie is that none of the characters are really ones you would get attached to.  If they die, big deal, if they don't well happy happy joy joy.  The movie doesn't give you those characters you get attached to and make you say ""damnit why couldn't he have lived!""
As for the extras, I think this flick is a pretty nice package all in all, its got some good extras to keep you entertained for awhile.  But nothing terribly earth shattering, just simple and nice to look at.
So in closure, this is a slick action flick that I feel is pretty real to life.  Hell all the characters are corrupt and well they don't hide the fact that they are.

Starring Benicio del Toro, Ryan Philippe, and Juliette Lewis, this film is definitely not for a young audience or an audience that doesn't like alot of shooting or gore.  My husband and I only watch it when we're sure the kids are in deep REM sleep.  The storyline is pretty interesting.  del Toro and Philippe are your well-rounded criminals, specializing in theft and murder.  When they plot to kidnap the pregnant woman (played by Juliette Lewis) who is a surrogate mother for a very wealthy couple and hold her and the unborn child for ransom, they get alot more than they bargained for.  Taye Diggs(who plays a bodyguard) and James Caan (who plays a hitman) are among the strong, all-star supporting cast, who are on the tail of the kidnappers.  The plot twists and turns, and definitely keeps you glued to your seat.  Get the popcorn and the snacks before sitting down, because you won't want to miss a second of this!  There are alot of shooting and gory scenes, but it is excellently directed and not badly written by McQuarrie.  McQuarrie doesn't do as great here as he did with The Usual Suspects, but this is worth getting if you like fast, edge-of-your-seat shooting films.

I have long been a fan of action thrillers, but have rarely come away from a movie so impressed. How often can you come away from an action movie and say that you've just seen something totally new, something you've never seen before?

1390355,2,B000053V7A,"McQuarrie is clearly a movie junkie.  This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.

I know that James Caan could have provided a better performance then them and I would have enjoyed the movie all the more if they had chose to include him.  Other then that major problem with the movie I must say that I did enjoy the movie and would like to see the writer/director again, but if he does make another movie I hope that he choses to include James Caan.

1390358,4,B000053V7A,"The Way Of The Gun: rated R, 1 hour and 59 minutes
To fully appreciate The Way Of The Gun requires a keen intellect, a propensity for the unusual film noire thriller, and an admiration for the paradoxical Mexican standoff. There is a lot more to this trashy action flick than meets the eye, a whole lot of underlying plot and symbolism grace the movie. Meet Parker and Longbaugh: two desperate, gun-toting desperados searching for the perfect plan to snag a load of cash. Enter Robin: the pregnant carrier of a multi-millionaire gangster's baby. The petty bandits seize the opportunity to kidnap the very pregnant Robin and hold her and the unborn baby ransom. Our pitiable protagonist thugs run into a slew of complications and life-threatening situations including appearances by two relentless, very creepy bodyguards, a faux doctor, and a resilient old hit-man who has yet to retire. The movie is undoubtedly far-fetched, and at times you will find that you just have to bear with it. It is fast paced, but often over-indulgent. Ryan Phillipe and Benicio Del Toro make the uncool Parker and Longbaugh cool as ice. Gazing at Del Toro's amusingly non-versatile, unchanging face ( la Clint Eastwood in his younger days) gives the illusion of the character being a sharp, chic, champion. Unfortunately, in this game, no one is a champion.
There is a certain twisted humor to all of the futility and implausibility of The Way Of The Gun. It is intentionally the farthest reaches from being endearing. The characters are cold and brutal and you are not supposed to like them. This gives the movie a unique edginess. One of the most notable successes of the movie is its elaborate and witty plot. The writing by Christopher McQuarrie is impeccable. It is not since The Usual Suspects (not coincidentally his last screenplay) that we receive such a brilliant and enthralling storyline. The difference is that this movie is both written and directed by the first-time director, McQuarrie. In this there is a great distinction that adds to the overall effect of the movie. Every timely shooting, and every confrontational shootout between multiple opponents that in itself becomes an artistic contradiction, we feel the passion of the characters, as well as of the filmmaker.
The Way Of The Gun is an odd film for its genre and many will dismiss it for its complexity and abstractness, but make no mistake, The Way Of The Gun is a misunderstood masterpiece.",1001116800,5,2451,4.9227053140096615

I'll admit that the multiple stories and plot twists can be confusing at times, but it's also what makes this film great. His attention to detail is evident in scenes that add that little extra something you wouldn't normally get in standard Hollywood pictures. Benicio del Toro gives an awesome performance in this. Many of his quirks are just on the fly and not scripted, which allows him to shine. Also solid performances by James Caan, Ryan Phillippe and Scott Wilson.

1390402,4,B000053V7A,"""The Way of The Gun""'s opening scene, with what may be the longest consecutive string of obscenities ever captured on film, is a wake-up call for unwary audiences who think they're watching just another crime thriller. This is a hard, nasty movie that pulls no punches, offers no heroes, and might just make you sick to your stomach. But it's one of the best-crafted crime films since McQuarrie and Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" with strong performances and unusually sharp direction for first-timer McQuarrie.
Benicio Del Toro and a surprisingly good Ryan Phillipe are Longbaugh and Parker, two jaded outlaws who think they've hit a big score when they kidnap the pregnant surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis, also better than usual) of a wealthy couple. Little do they realize that the parents-to-be have mob connections, and will do anything to get their unborn child back safe and sound. James Caan is fantastic as the more noble of Parker and Longbaugh's antagonists, a world-weary mob ""bagman"" with a certain code of honor. Complications mount, family connections are revealed, and the situation just gets uglier and uglier, leading to a nicely staged shootout in a Mexican brothel, an unexpected moment of grace, and a wickedly funny final line.
""The Way of The Gun"" is exceedingly graphic. Bullet wounds are hideous and messy, and the injured howl in agony rather than wince and keep on going. McQuarrie handles the violence unflinchingly but responsibly, unafraid to make gunfire sound frightening, or linger on the dead bodies of innocent bystanders. It's a refreshingly unglamorized portrayal of gunplay. McQuarrie also shows an impressive skill at coaxing good performances out of less-than-gifted actors, and has some nearly brilliant visual compositions, as the camera's revalation of a character previously standing outside of frame changes the whole context of a preceding scene.
""The Way of the Gun""'s R rating should be taken seriously; this is a film whose funniest scene involves Russian roulette. But brave film fans seeking a searing, no-holds-barred dose of Western noir won't be disappointed.",996969600,3,2120,5.275147928994083

1390435,5,B000053V7A,"""The Way of the Gun"" is the best American movie I've seen since ""Traffic"". Certainly they're different types of films, but the similarities lie in their intelligence and their respective directors' evident love for movies. But I'd have to give the nod to ""WotG"", simply because Christopher McQuarrie wrote and directed his own movie, whereas Soderbergh simply directed someone else's script (itself adapted from someone else's).
If you didn't like this movie, I dare say it's because you were expecting another mindless American shoot-em-up. ""WotG"" is an ""atmosphere"" movie, a modern western, with unsympathetic and unrepentant characters who don't apologize for who they are or what they do. McQuarrie admirably does not tell us everything about his characters and their motivations, and that makes them all the more interesting. Parker and Longbaugh seem to know a lot about weapons and tactics, but we never get the typical Hollywood discussion about ""back when we were in the army, or on the force, etc."" that a lesser writer would have included, or a less intelligent producer would have insisted on.
Speaking of tactics, they were superb. A couple of minor technical glitches that most viewers won't notice, but all in all some very convincing (and realistic) action--and the antithesis of ""Charlie's Angels""-type fantasy action. Characters load weapons, and reload, and reload. None of these Hong Kong action-style ""bottomless"" guns. Very realistic, and very refreshing. The DVD includes a hilarious script excerpt which was not filmed, and vividly illustrates McQuarrie's understanding of the Hollywood cliches he eschews.
Not a perfect movie, but very nearly. The re-watchability quotient is very high. I recommend it highly. And if you don't like it, then you'll just have to wait patiently for Pearl Harbor's release on DVD.",992649600,5,1835,5.3310344827586205

It's theme of Bad Men finding Redemption, it's Mexican Settings and it's ""Hail of Bullets"" Ending would have made Pekinpah Proud.
The Character-actor filled Cast give Wonderful Performances, Particularly James Caan, who has played this sort of role Countless times before, but Still manages to Squeeze something new out this time around. Juliette Lewis is also great, her Character has a lot to Carry, a Baby and the Weight of the Entire Film, as it All Revolves around her, if the audience don't Like her, then the Game is off, we won't Care what Happens to her and the film would become a Poor Excuse to show Violent Killings. Thankfully that doesn't happen. Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt also have hard roles as their roles are Easily the most Unlikeable, as they are meant to be Completely Emotionless, Diggs overcomes this as he is Naturally a good actor, Katts doesn't, he just recycles his Emotionless Robot role from ""Boiler Room"", as he is Not that good an actor.

Christopher McQuarrie's Directorial Debut looks like just a Taste of things to come in his young career, the Tip of the Iceberg.

McQuarrie has created two of the best characters I've ever scene on film.  Parker and Longbaugh are two men that are bad and never, never make excuses or come to realization that they'd live better lives if they stopped being bad.  This is unheard of when it comes to anti-heros of this relaxed film noir genre.  Usually the anti-heros find by the end of the movies that what they've done is wrong and you pity them, but Parker straight out says that they do not regret what they've done and they don't want are pity.  This type of character seems to be a new one that I would call an anti-character.  Absolutely revolutionary.  Now if you're not going to watch Way of the Gun for the characters than at least watch it for the opening sequence which is the best way to start a movie that I've ever seen.  It's so outrageous and over the top that it's shocking and funny.  It also sums up what kind of guys these are that you're actually dealing with.  There are parts of the movie that drag a little which is why I had to take away the one star, but overall this is a great, overlooked movie that should be taken very seriously.",990057600,3,1294,4.305785123966942

The overall feel of The Way of the Gun is amateurish, from the horrible accompaniment to the third rate direction of this talented ensemble.  Benecio Del Toro and Ryan Phillipe give their most forgettable performances as a basic street thugs who stumble upon a seemingly simply kidnapping scheme.  However, things go terribly wrong (who could have guessed?) and the story gets vastly complicated when the boys learn that they have just kidnapped the surrogate mother for the local mafioso.  James Caan turns in some excellent work as a beat down old bag man, who is conflicted on many levels.  Great line from Caan ""The only thing that you can assume about a broken down old man is that he's a survivor.""  Juliette Lewis gives a decent performance, but again McQuarrie falls into every directing pitfall.  It's like he's trying to be a mix of Rodriguez, Tarantino, and Sergio Leone, needless to say the result is mixed.  The ending is either a homage to Leone's westerns of the mid to late '60's or a bad rip-off.  The best scene of the movie occurs in the first five minutes of the film, when Phillipe bloodies a loud-mouth bimbo with no emotion, pretty cool but as with the rest of this film it's all style and no substance.",987379200,3,1364,4.622406639004149

1390487,1,B000053V7A,"The Way of the Gun (Christopher McQuarrie, 2000)

The Way of the Gun gets my vote for ""most boring action film of 2000"" by a pretty wide margin. McQuarrie, who wrote one of the finest mysteries ever filmed (The Usual Suspects), takes his own turn at the directorial helm here, and let's hope he learned from the many mistakes he made in his debut.

It's a relatively simple premise-- two down-on-their-luck small-time crooks, Parker, and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillippe and Benicio del Toro, respectively) decide to kidnap the surrogate mother of an extremely wealthy family. Her two rather inept bodyguards, Jeffers and Obecks (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) pursue the two outlaws and their charge with much blowing up of things and lots of shots fired.

Why such a can't-miss premise with such a stellar cast (including Juliette Lewis as the kidnap victim and James Caan as a very honked-off surrogate father) could have taken such a boring turn is beyond me. Perhaps McQuarrie requires a Bryan Singer behind the camera to make his visions come to life. He, on the other hand, takes excellent actors and manages to make them lifeless. I didn't think that was possible with Nicky Katt, but there ya go.

I didn't think I'd see a worse film this year than After the Storm, but here it is. (zero)",986428800,11,1286,4.753363228699552
1390488,4,B000053V7A,"I confess.  I like gunplay in movies done really well.  I also like quirky characters, and nice & nasty little twists in story & dialogue.  The Way of the Gun has all of the above, and that's why I like it.
If you don't like that stuff, give it a pass.  But, if you do, you will be treated to Mr. McQarries first directorial outing which has many of the same pleasures as his script for The Usual Suspects.  Suspects was a better movie with a more richly developed plot and of course, more surprises, but it would hardly be fair to expect that clever a story again.
Way of the Gun, nonetheless, has much of the same deadpan humor and characters with a twist to them.  Benecio del Torres & Ryan Phillipe make Parker & Longbaugh (the real names of Butch Cassidy and Sundance if you didn't know) believable amoral low lifes trying to score big.  There is nice interplay between James Caan (doing one of his better roles in years)as the Old Pro and Taye Diggs as the cool younger killer.  The rest of the supporting cast is fine as well.
McQarrie handles the violence and gunplay in very similar fashion as Bryan Singer did in Suspects....with stylish and offbeat twists.  The major shootout at the end is a dandy of it's kind.
I don't think Way of the Gun is great, but it is much better than just okay.  So it's a 3 plus or a 4 minus.  As I said at the outset, if it's your type of story...it is well done and worth a look.",985824000,,1421,4.225925925925926

The air smells tangy of gun smoke, your ears are sore from the raucous sounds of pistol fire, and you feel the weight of a sledgehammer pelt your chest as a .44 caliber slug punches you down. Wait. A new smell fills your nostrils, a smell you recognize. An oily, overtly buttery smell that can only be one thing: movie popcorn. You have been watching director/screenplay writer Christopher Mcquarrie's The Way of the Gun. Mcquarrie is also responsible for writing Usual Suspects, one of the most thickly plotted movies of recent history. The gunplay scenes are arguably the best of modern day. Often you have the case where a lone gunman dodges bullet after bullet, but always fells his opponents in one shot. Things are different in The Way of the Gun. The realism is as undeniable as gravity. You find yourself in the theater, heart accelerating as the intensity building until the final moment of truth...
The Way of the Gun consists of a deranged plot in which two criminals Parker and Longbaugh-played by Ryan Phillippe (from Studio 54) and Benicio Del Toro respectively-decide to hijack a surrogate mother named Robin, played by Juliette Lewis, and hold her for ransom.  Robin is carrying her baby for a wealthy family. This seems to be a marriage of necessity because for some reason or another the wealthy family cannot propagate and Robin is hard up for cash. James Caan, who plays Joe Sarno and Taye Diggs who plays Jeffers, are among the lot of people hunting down the mother-nappers for bounty.
The plot, as the Chubby Checker song suggests, takes a twist as Robin decides she has something beautiful in her belly, a baby.  Another element somewhat overshadowed by the peculiar plot",985392000,,1721,4.827118644067797

The story: Two hoods (Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Philippe) kidnap a young pregnant woman (Juliette  Lewis) who carries the child of a mob-connected millionaire (Scott Wilson). Wilson's experienced enforcer (James Caan) and bodyguards have to handle the situation from then on. Lots of shoot-outs, double-crosses and small twists ensue.
Great directorial debut by Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning screenwriter for 'The Usual Suspects'. He directs with attitude giving the movie a slight noirish atmosphere yet interrupting this with Hong-Kong movie style shoot-outs (the actors shoot whole clips at a go) in perfect harmony. He brings the best out of the actors, especially Del Toro and the always reliable Caan who gets some great lines from McQuarries's script.
This movie is enamoured with the gun and eventually overkills because some characters get introduced just to be shot down with loads and loads of bullets in the climax which is reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah's classic 'The Wild Bunch' with undertones from 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. In fact Del Toro and Philippe's characters are named Parker and Longbaugh, the real surnames of Butch and Sundance.

For one thing, if you buy this movie because you loved *The Usual Suspects*, you'll be a tad disappointed.  *TUS* is a better movie.  Sorry Chris.  I know from listening to the commentary track on the DVD that this kind of criticism really steams McQuarrie, and that's understandable because the movie ought to be seen without those kind of expectations.
But watching the movie twice helped me separate the two films and appreciate this one all the more.  The movie just overflows with the talent and subtelty of its performers.  Not just the actors.  The score is fantastic.  The lighting, photography and look of the movie is always interesting.  And the set pieces are really well drawn.
On the other hand, the screenplay lacks a center of gravity.  The two main characters (played expertly by del Toro and Phillipe) keep you guessing, and, ultimately, leave you guessing.  The supporting parts are more grounded, but there's still something missing. The 'revelation' at the end is not all that satisfying, although it does make sense of some of the clues that the movie dropped along the way.  I would have been more surpised had I been more fully (un)prepared for it.  The Juliette Lewis-character's motives, for instance, could have been made more clear, and ultimately a little more devestating.  As it is, however, I was kind of left holding my ... er... remote.
But it's still a helluva lot more interesting to give over an evening to watching this movie than the kind of drivel that apparently makes the Academy members wet their pants.  (*Gladiator* for best picture??????) Bottom Line:  I'm glad to own this film.  It repays several viewings.  Here's why:
1) The actors.  Benicio del Toro is sublime. (""You don't want to be touched by guys like us.  It's creepy."") Ryan Phillipe turns out a suprisingly subtle and thoughtful performance.  (I say suprising because of his rep as a teen idol.  But remember Johnny Depp?) Juliette Lewis can do anything.  You will feel her pain.  And her father, Jeffrey Lewis is, as always, much fun to watch.  Ditto James Caan, and the guy who plays Dr. Alan Painter (sorry; can't remember his name).
2) It grows on you.  Watch it twice right off the bat.  Also, definitely listen to the commentary track.  If you can get over the not too understated bitterness of the film-maker that this movie was a box-office flop, you'll still find much to learn about the collaborative process of making a film.  You'll also get a sense of what the movie could have been had it not been RUTHLESSLY over-edited.  (But don't get your hopes up about Baltimore.  You'll have to figure that out yourself.)",982108800,4,2734,4.7633262260127935
1390513,4,B000053V7A,"This movie has its fair share of detractors but I give Christopher McQuarrie full credit for what he was trying to do here. This is a crime movie that goes against everything that we are so used to seeing in crime movies nowadays. Parker and Longbaugh, the film's main characters, are to put it bluntly, scumbags. You'll get evidence of this in the first two minutes of the movie, one of the best openings for a film I've seen. The thing is, the movie doesn't try to tell you different and doesn't attempt to apologize for their actions and the actions of every other character in the story, it just serves it to you in your face. That's why I loved this movie: for it's gritty realism. People don't always have impeccable aim when shooting at someone. Shootouts can and do happen in close proximity without anybody getting hit. Not everyone has a heart of gold. Not everyone has optimistic views. I only have one or two minor gripes with this film and their not even anything really destructive in the overall package. The film demands your complete attention. As much action as there is, it is dialouge driven and if you miss just one important sentence, the film can be hard to follow because this movie is pretty loaded with twists. Yeah, Ryan Phillippe might be a little too young for his part and his rep as a pretty boy might put some of you off but he surprised me here. Any of you reading this think that Stephen Baldwin had it in him until you saw the Usual Suspects? My point, exactly. Benicio creates a character that puts his earlier Fenster to shame. His performance here is awesome. But then again, what did you expect? I'm gonna stop here with praises for the rest of the cast (especially Geoffrey Lewis; his character's introduction is one of the most hilarious and original that I have ever seen) and one BIG thumbs up for the film's score. Joe Kraemer, the man responsible, does an AMAZING job with the music. Thankfully, the dvd comes packed with an isolated score feature complete with commentary by Mr. Kraemer because it has to be heard to be believed.

When the script arrived in the hands of Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro it was a jaw- drapping, edge of your seat, action movie that never failed to keep the audience interested or disappointed.
Then something happened.
The night before filming began, something drastic happened to the script.  I'm not quite sure, but I'm thinking the director's dog dumped a massive load all over it thus completely destroying it. The only redeemable thing the writers could think of was to hand a pen and paper to some locals at a bar and see what they come up with.
The result was the movie that ended up in the theaters, the movie that I would rather throw myself into a fire than see again. Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro would never have starred in a movie like this, but since they'd already signed the contracts, they couldn't get out of it. Juliette Lewis's part was added at the last minute, hence she looked like she crawled out from underneath a rock, and didn't have time to get all gussied up.

1390521,5,B000053V7A,"Christopher McQuarrie succeeds in spades in translating his ultra-stylish flair, first unveiled in his script for The Usual Suspects, into the directing.  The Way of the Gun is less innovative narratively than The Usual Suspects, but the suspense and action sequences are hair-raising, the acting uniformly fascinating, and makes for highly engaging viewing.
Benecio del Toro proves once again why he's one of the most coveted actors on the scene today with a turn that's simultaneously playful, downtrodden, edgy and endearing.  Surprisingly, onscreen partner Ryan Phillipe holds his own, projecting a scuzziness and violence hitherto never demonstrated.  James Caan is adequate in a low-key villain role, and Taye Diggs makes for a good adversary for our ""heroes"".
The most astonishing thing about The Way of the Gun is McQuarrie's treatment of the action sequences.  Quite simply the best gunfight scenes since Heat in 1995 here, much of it shot in a similar fashion to Michael Mann's (little music, real-time, wide-open spaces), and that incredible ""car"" sequence keeps you glued to the screen and to your seat.  McQuarrie mounts a ton of tension with nearly no visible onscreen violence in the first 2/3 of this movie, and it's an amazing feat.  And when he lets loose the carnage during the climactic showdown, it's a rip-snorting experience.  Throughout, McQuarrie injects humour at decorous spots (much of it thanks to del Toro's devilish persona) and also comes up with some marvellous sight gags amidst the blood-curdling action.
Yes, most of the characters here are lowlife types, but their vividity keeps you interested.  And none of them behaves in a predictable manner.  The Way of the Gun is a rousing confrontation that rarely slows down, and one of the best action films of the past several years.",980640000,2,1814,5.163822525597269

1390534,4,B000053V7A,"This is a good film with superb performances by  Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe who are two desperate guys looking to make some easy cash.  Juliette Lewis plays the pregnant kidnap victim who is held for ransom and James Caan stars as the bagman.  James Caan does a terrific job and plays his part well.
Benicio and Ryan play down and out criminals who happen to pick the wrong person to mess with and that is when all the trouble starts.  There are numerous gun battles and a lot of blood but the scenes are believable.
The film reminded me of a cross between Pulp Fiction and Usual Suspects.  There was not near as many twists and turns and being compared to those two fine films is a compliment.
What kind of made this movie different is that you really do not have a hero or a villian.  I found myself not really pulling for anyone to make it or die.  I think it was intentionally made that way.  Nobody was a really a good guy and nobody was the bad guy.  I guess in reality they were all bad guys!

The two play people who were tired of the normal life and chose to go off the beaten path.  Sooner or later this leads them to kidnap Juliette Lewis, who is carrying a very prominent business man's baby.  Now, the two of them are getting deeper into Mexico with two hit-men, Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs, the Police, and a Bagman (James Caan) after them.  This is a deeply ejoyable disturbing film that shows true grit in its' greatest form.  The performances from every single actor are stunning.  Especially Benicio Del Torro's.

1390537,4,B000053V7A,"First let me say this.  I am giving this DVD 4 Stars because of the extras.  Commentary is fine, interviews are ok, except they are sprinkled in the biography portion.  To see them you read a page about the actor, you hit the arrow button and you hear a soundbyte from them.  Then you read more, and see more.  Repeat this over and over and you have the gist of it.  But where is the Trailer?  I mean there are DVDs that have only a trailer like the Rock and Escape From New York, and call it a special feature.  Anyway, let's talk about this masterpiece called Way of The Gun.
The first scene is a little harsh.  You have the two ""heros"" sitting on a car exchanging nasty words with a couple.  There is some violence towards women, and a couple choice words.  But I feel it's there to let you know what to expect from this movie, a warning if you will.  The opening credits are a nice throwback to the movies of the 50s and 60s as well.  Just who is in it and who did what on a black screen with no fancy fonts.  Cut to the movie.  You have Ryan Phillipe (in his best role) and Benicio Del Toro (another stellar role for this fine actor) as two criminals living by the day and dollar to dollar.  While at the spermbank (they get paid big bucks, but in reality you only get like $50.00 and that's after 3 months of work) they hear about a surrogate mother for a rich couple, and they hatch a plan to kidnap her.  And hilarity ensues.
I don't want to give away too much, but there is one of the slowest carchases ever, and in a good way.  Taye Diggs does an awesome follow-up to Go, and James Caan is great as (almost) always.  There are people called ""bagmen"" (the guy that drops the ransom off) in this film that make Member Only almost cool again.  Almost.  Sharp dialogue and a nice homage to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the two ""heros"" go by the last names of Butch and Sundance.  Also some creative use of barb wire and some nice twists in character.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie, you owe it to yourself.",979084800,8,2028,4.156812339331619
1390538,5,B000053V7A,"Lets keep this short and sweet. The Way of the Gun rocks, it is the only modern action movie with any brains to show. Benicio Del Toro is fantastic. 'Nuff Said",979084800,,159,4.161290322580645
1390539,5,B000053V7A,"I highly recommend this film. Although it's less of a mind game than ""The Usual Subjects,"" the acting and high-impact plot more than make up for it. The action never stops -- literally. Sure, there's a good amount of blood being spilled on the screen, but this is a much more intelligent film than the usual mindless action plots that come out of big-budget Hollywood studios. It's too bad this film didn't grab the attention it deserves and do better at the theatres, but at least you can see it at home. Don't miss this film.",978998400,,527,4.5
1390540,4,B000053V7A,"When I first went to see this movie in theatres, I went with shades of The Usual Suspects in my mind, but knowing that there was no way any film could totally live up to that master piece of a film. Well Christopher McQuarrie's The Way of the Gun gave it a shot, and yes, while not living up to Suspects, it still was a damn good film. In a nutshell, it tells the tale of Parker and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro) and a kidnapping caper gone wrong. Along the way they meet a colorful cast of characters including the kidnapped woman's (Juliette Lewis) pair of bodyguards (Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs), an aging Mafia bagman (James Cann), and quite a few more. Now while the story gets a bit confusing and even lacks a little at time, the real center piece of this movie are the clever, gritty, exceptional, etc. performances delivered by Del Toro and Cann (Phillippe is good to) and the wild action sequences, which in my opinion do not try to mimic the style of John Woo, and have a cool style all their own.  And remember the characters in this film were purposely made to be SOB's that the watcher doesn't like. Their all scumbags and that makes it all the better. All in all good film. And thankfully, the DVD does the theatrical release justice on the small screen. Picture wise, the film has been given a quality transfer to the DVD format and is presented in anamorphic widescreen which is always a plus.  However, on the edges of the left and right side of the screen is a thin, dark bar that slightly decolorizes the image at the very edge of the screen. Now this film was shot with a filter over the lens and I believe that the lines may be intentional, but who knows, maybe it's just my TV. Other then that the picture is great and the Dolby 5.1 sound presentation is awesome. Watching the shoot out near the end of the movie is amazing; hearing shots coming from every single direction with the loudness of an actual gunshot and not the muffled down gun shot sound effects you hear in some movies is great and the screams of whatever character happens to be screaming or yelling just makes you wince, no matter how loud or soft it may be (be sure to watch out for what i like to call the ""crotch shot"" delieverd by Phillippe's shotgun to a bagman). This DVD isn't exactly packed with special features, but it does give you the theatrical trailer and a few TV spots, all of which are pretty entertaining. Also, you're treated to the usual behind the scenes featurette and some short cast and crew interviews, and the typical cast and crew filmographies. Lastly, there is a script and story board of a deleted sequence, and while a bit awkward to navigate through, is very entertaining because reading McQuarrie's script for this really lets you know how much he likes to make fun of today's film industry, and all in all the scene is pretty entertaining and wild. To think, Christopher Walken could have been in this movie!  So in the end, The Way of the Gun is a great, black comedy, action packed, twist and turn filled directorial debut from Suspects penner McQuarrie, and is brought home on a nicely packaged and presented DVD. A taste of things to come...hopefully.",978652800,3,3196,4.478559176672384
1390541,1,B000053V7A,"I have to admit that during the course of reading most of these posted reviews, I was afflicted by spasms of uncontrollable laughter.  How can any rational being take the half-baked, insultingly cliched, adolescent dialogue of this miserable movie seriously?  In light of the writer/director's pedigree (notwithstanding the ill-conceived mess of the ""Public Access"" script), along with glowing reviews/cover stories proffered in the likes of ""Uncut"", I geniunely wanted to like this debacle.  I really did.  Unfortunately, the aforementioned pseudo-philosophical, unintendedly-hilarious dialogue, painfully insipid direction (and by the way, who, except those with WAY too much time on their hands honestly gives a damn if the way the guns are handled is realistic or not?  Since everything else in the movie is so blatantly contrived and inauthentic, it seems a particularly moot point), appalling ""acting"" (with the possible exception of Benicio, who does a decent enough job with the dreck he's given)and pathetically unoriginal and predictable script, precluded my enjoyment of it, oddly enough.
Pointless, witless, and ultimately, incredibly boring.  Unless you're under the age of 16, or have an IQ of under 50, avoid at all costs.",978652800,14,1237,5.553191489361702

Thats what I loved about this picture.  If violence offends you what in blazes are you watching a movie called ""The Way of the Gun""?
Its does recall Peckinpah's the Wild Bunch (although they named themselves after Butch and the Sundance Kid) but in a thoroughly post-modern bent.  Yeah, the gunplay is some of the best I've seen.  Del Toro and Phillipe looked like pros handling their weapons in tight quarters. (Finally actors who kept their fingers off the triggers when they weren't shooting, I appreciated that.) Kudos to whoever was the technical advisor.
  I first had reservations about Phillipe playing a Heavy but both he and especially Benicio Del Toro exude tons of charisma and menace.  They would have both fit in well with either DeNiro's or Keitel's Crew.
Admittedly, some of the plot points aren't fully articulated (no, its not as finely crafted as LA Confidential or the Usual Suspects) but it does nicely in the crime genre.",978480000,,1105,4.924324324324324
1390551,4,B000053V7A,"The universe in general, and the world of moviegoing in specific, really has to lose using Tarantino as a bench mark for cinema. Believe it or not, loud shooty heist movies like ""The Way of the Gun""  existed before Tarantino, so it's sad that any film that can be categorized as a heist movie or a caper flick post-""Reservoir Dogs"" has to be dismissed as ""Tarantino-esque.""
Don't get me wrong: ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. But even Tarantino himself would admit he wasn't blazing new ground there. Peckinpah and a host of others were doing crime thrillers way before QT brought the black-suit-and thin-black-tie ensemble to these shores (from Hong Kong action movies, natch, as well as old American gangster films).
That having been said, ""Way of the Gun"" is great for what it is, and it knows exactly what it should be. The opening scene sets the mood of the film: loud, brash, unapologetic and brutally funny. The film follows this, and manages to take the audience on a nice little trip along the way. Gone are the chatty hitmen and pop culture references that make movies truly ""Tarantino-esque,"" and make rip-offs of ""Dogs"" like ""Truth And Consequences, N.M."" so lame. What's left with ""Gun"" is a taut, well made film. ""Gladiator"" it's not, but then again, it's not supposed to be.",978393600,,1313,4.784140969162996

Let me be as straightfoward about this movie as possible: You aren't really supposed to like anyone in it. Yes, thats right, none of the characters are really good people. I fought with this as I watched it for the first time. I guess that you have to be a bit less than pristine and judgemental to enjoy this one, but come on what a film! The violence was gloriously shot by McQuarrie and Phillipe and Del Toro should be established headliners due to this one. James Caan is outstanding as he has always been. The story is great, the action is better, the acting is surprisingly good, and it combines the essence of so many different genres that it is irresistable.

1390553,3,B000053V7A,"This film was made with a huge ambition. The filmaker wanted to make a film that would be a huge story, but somewhere along the way he messed things up a little. The story revolves around to kidnappers, Phillipe, and the great Benicio Del Toro, and their plan to kidnap a surogate mother to collect the money that she will receive for having this child. The plot hits a few snags when the mother, played by the ever annoying Julliete ""the other sister"" Lewis enters. All the actress does is yell about everything. This acting style gets on every last nerve after her first five minutes. The gun play is probably the loudest i have ever heard in a movie. The film starts off incredible, with a hilarious altercation at a night club, then the film starts to drift into trouble with the rest of the plot, and how to get the movie to go along at an even pace.",977097600,2,855,4.35

I was going to go see it a fourth time but i was greeted by a sign posted in the movie theater saying The Way of the Gun has been pulled from the New Jersey movie theaters. It was said to have been pulled for it's intense and graphic violence but I think that's just a load of BS. By no way is The Way of the Gun a violence jam packed movie trying to pull it's audience in with blood and gore. Sure, the movie has plenty but not enough for it to be pulled from the theaters. The movie's dialog is cunning and it's script is masterfully written. The casting for this movie couldn't be better. The only casting fault I found was the annoying voice of the pregnant, Juliette Lewis. The realism blew me away. The real sounding gun shots (not those fake Terminator sound FX) the realistic flesh wounds and makeup jobs, the soundtrack and the ingenius gunfights. The sniping scene alone makes this movie worth watching over and over. This is by far the best work of art on film I've ever seen and probably ever will see. There's not a single flaw with the movie. It is obvious this movie was well thought out and well planned. It would be a shame if this movie doesn't win some major awards including best movie for 2000, but this probably won't happen due to the Academy's lack of taste.

Some may say it is mindless senceless violence, I say wrong,look again. All the violence is very directed, and to a point, no wasted energy. The plot twists, are entertaining, as in usual suspects. The movie does harken to sixties style movies, with the likes of Lee Marvin, and Steve Mcqueen.
As a Full time firearms instuctor, for a metropolitin agency, I tip my hat to who ever did the weapons craft instruction to the actors, particulary Del Toro and Phillipe. No mistakes, real world pro moves, the first from a movie! Haveing seen a few real world bag men ( I hate bag men) I have to say Mr. Cann, and friends nailed that to a T.

The film starts off as a darkly written, hilarious piece of literature. And it doesn`t end there. Then the movie becomes very Tarintino-esque, and from there, a bit of western style violence (ie: Desperado). Even though, at times, it was a little soap-opera-ish, it`s a great film, with a great cast, a great script and superb direction.

Overly dramatic acting and a completely mis-matched score makes this movie humorous to watch. Juliette Lewis delivers the only real performance, but it's still not enough to save this movie. Christopher McQuarrie tried using John Woo's gun scenes accompanied by a Shawshank Redemption-style score in the background. It just doesn't work.

I don't want to be comparing Tarantino, Sodebergh, and Mcquarrie here so I'll skip to the meat of the movie:  The Dialogue....nobody talks like this and at times it seems like rambling, but the actors in the Way of the Gun carry it in a way that is amusing and at the same time tolerable, 'specially old bagman James Caan.  Benicio Del Toro is great as usual and most will be surprised at Ryan Philippe's performance who adds gruffness with a beard to portray the scumbag.  As petty, life  criminals, Del Toro and Philippe seem to make up their heists as they go along which brings them to their ""final, one big score"" they've been looking for while at a sperm bank no less.
The story tends to steer towards confusion with everybody taking a piece of the action and their interests are all intertwined but it is all tied up nicely in the end.  Another minus for most might be the drab and gory tone of the movie but it is not overdone.  In referring to the title, you'll see plenty of muzzle flash in this movie,  where all sides are well versed in the way of the gun.

This is probably the best performance Ryan Phillippe has ever given. And of course as in everything he does, Benicio Del Toro is great. Even James Caan gives a good role as a bagman out to get the pair.
