8713894,1,B00WQSZL3K,"Horrible  Bad acting with a middle school plot (plot????) and less than sophomoric humor

8713898,4,B00WQSZL3K,"It's a COMEDY with drama and romance.  Sure, some of the gags are little sophomoric, but so were movies like Porky's I &  ii.  The jokes were humorous, and I liked the old lady from the senior assisted living home. Acting was OK and the storyline believable.  I've been binge watching the comedy genre and fine this is better than all 2 stars and some if the 3 star movies.",1504396800,2,373,4.285714285714286
8713899,2,B00WQSZL3K,"Three babes and three hunks, all strangers, are selected to spend a week at a beach house with no rules. It is just a question of who hooks up with whom and the little bit a drama to go along with it in order to give this sinker some social value. The humor is slap stick and below sophomoric teen sex humor. The characters were unreal and were given single line introductions.

2 stars for the nudity
