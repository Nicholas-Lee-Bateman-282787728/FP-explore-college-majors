I would like to see the child of Priya (from Krrish 3) develop as a child and into his adulthood.  Also, I thought that, while the Jadoo connection was mentioned/shown at the end of the Krrish movie, that could have played a bigger part in the movie when the hero was in jeopardy.",1502409600,,453,4.183908045977011

8632696,5,B00HH1BOLO,"How can one man be so handsome and talented?  Hrithik Roshan is so easy on the eyes that I sometimes forget to read the English subtitles!  Watch the films in order so that you can become acquainted with the characters, especially Rihit, Krishna, and Krrish (all played beautifully by Roshan, sometimes in the same scene).

You will recognize lots of references to the many action films on the market, but Roshan is genuinely believable in all of his roles.  Oh, can that man DANCE.  The birthday party scene in Krrish 3 is one I watch over and over...WOW.

If you are new to the bollywood genre, this set of 3 films will be a great starter.  And the soundtracks to these films are also worth checking out.",1391040000,3,706,4.511811023622047
