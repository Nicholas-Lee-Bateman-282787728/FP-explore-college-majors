8495006,1,B0068VP8XO,This was in an unwrapped case and was blurry! Seems like a poor copy of a home made video.,1516579200,,90,3.789473684210526
8495007,3,B0068VP8XO,"while everything was received on time, the videos are from the viewpoint of a car, not a bike, runner or walker so it was a bit disappointing.  It doesn't have the feel of being on a bike ride at all...",1421193600,2,202,4.05
8495008,5,B0068VP8XO,The towns and national parks were lovely and fun all the way to Maine!,1407715200,,70,4.071428571428571
8495009,5,B0068VP8XO,Enjoyed the diversity of the scenery and the places they took us on this trip.  Very enjoyable diversion for a stationary bike ride.,1401753600,,132,4.739130434782608
8495010,2,B0068VP8XO,"Found it boring to spin to Spinning rides North Carolina and Southern California are much, much better, a lot of preview videos are on you tube",1386288000,,143,4.538461538461538
8495011,4,B0068VP8XO,"I play this DVD for my indoor cycling class. My class loves the beautiful scenery.  The only issue I have is that there are few hills - its all pretty flat so when you're ""climbing"" on your bike the visual doesn't go along with the drill.",1376870400,2,238,4.173913043478261
8495012,3,B0068VP8XO,"I bought this last year to play in front of a stationary bike at my health club. I've been very happy with two others (Zion National Park and The Pacific Coast Highway. But this one will not play on the club's older DVD player, though it will on my own player at home. Too bad! Having all three to choose from would make nice alternatives for an otherwise boring ride during the ""indoor riding"" months! PS: What might be nice is a small icon on the screen that notes inclines and declines as they happen.",1367971200,2,504,4.315789473684211
8495013,5,B0068VP8XO,DVD arrived in excellent condition and in a very timely manner.  I have not seen the entire DVD as of yet but I am pleased with this purchase and will probably be purchasing more.,1362787200,,179,4.264705882352941
8495014,3,B0068VP8XO,"I own several of the Bike-O-Vision DVD's.  I'd give all 4 stars for scenery....but the music is not motivational enough for a good workout.  The videos should come with the option to select different music tracks, from classical to pop to rock.  I won't be buying anymore videos for this reason!",1361577600,,295,4.745098039215686
8495015,4,B0068VP8XO,"I live in AZ now 16yrs. I bike every day 20min. Music is very movating and not something I got tired of hearing.
Scenery always enjoyable. Bought the ride threw New England also I liked it so much.",1361145600,3,197,4.2105263157894735
