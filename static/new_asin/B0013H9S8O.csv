I was excited about this one after seeing the first one (The Long Way Round), but I was really disappointed to see that there were only 6 episodes on this disk as opposed to the some 10 - 12, maybe more on The Long Way Round.

This one was rushed and I can understand that Ewan McGregor had other obligations to meet, but what a disappointment this one was!

Hoping they do a Long Way South through South America because quite frankly, this one sucked a fat one.",1210636800,7,733,5.831775700934579
