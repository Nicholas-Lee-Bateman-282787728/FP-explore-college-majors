8052826,1,B0007WFUVA,This video made me laugh.  Pilates is not Yoga.  This 20 min workout did not make me sweat.  (that to me is a good workout).  It seemed to me 2 ladies set up a video camera in the living room and over dubbed the vocals.  I was very disappointed.,1170115200,4,245,3.9183673469387754
8052827,4,B0007WFUVA,"Pilates for Life Butt & Hips is a Pilates workout focused on the lower body.  Instructor Amy Brown begins with Pilates breathing; remaining in a reclined position, she leads you through hip lifts, a hamstring stretch, and leg circles.  Moving on to a side position, she does a series of moves that are somewhat similar to the popular Winsor Buns & Thighs video:  there is a front leg extension and several variations of clamshells (opening and closing the bent legs).  Heel beats are performed before transitioning to the other side.  The final part of the workout is done on all fours, and this section reminded me of the butt segment from Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates.  Here, Amy leads you through several extended leg moves, including leg circles, heel lifts, and knee ins.  The workout concludes with a brief neck stretch (very nice!).

Overall, this is a good lower body Pilates workout that I would rate at an experienced beginner or low intermediate level.  Although the case claims that this DVD offers two workouts, Beginner and Intermediate, there is really only one:  the ""Beginner"" workout is simply Amy's assistant Liza showing beginning modifications (which she does not do very often here).  Similarly, the ""Overview"" option takes you to the same workout but with added instructions appearing on screen.  Finally, although there is a stability ball pictured on the DVD cover, no ball is used for this workout.",1156377600,8,1425,4.966244725738397
8052828,3,B0007WFUVA,"I have completed the workout(s). On the cover, it advertises that there is a 20 min beginner workout, 20 min intermediate workout and 30 min overview.  I expected 2 different workouts and I was sorely disappointed!  Please be aware: the beginner and intermediate workout is *exactly the same*! The only difference is there is slightly more emphasis on Ms Brown (who is placing her hands differently- say on her hips rather than the floor). Otherwise, it was a good workout...  The *only* refuge is the fact I only paid $7 for the dvd.  And because of the ""false advertisement"" I will never buy another one of her dvds again.",1144800000,5,624,4.697247706422019
8052829,4,B0007WFUVA,"I just purchased this video last week and only previewed it so far. But, I wanted to let others know that the cover on the case is misleading. I purchased this video thinking it was a stability ball workout (well, she is sitting on a stability ball on the cover), but no where in this video does she use the ball. It does seem like a good video and I do look forward to trying it out.",1139356800,7,384,4.0
