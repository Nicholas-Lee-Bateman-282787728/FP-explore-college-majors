8010454,5,B0001DCYPK,"Another installment in what I consider the BEST ANIME EVER PRODUCED!
Visually stunning with an incredibly rich and complex yet engaging storyline.
The music is also bar-none in comparison with todays broadcast norm.
I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed in this series.
HOWEVER, I recommend you watch the volumes in order to understand the complex storyline.
ENJOY!",1293235200,,368,5.362068965517241
8010455,5,B0001DCYPK,"""Last Exile"" just gets better with each new DVD release.
""Discovered Attack"" offers more action, wonderful anime and information about the leading characters.  We finally find out what Alvis is ""carrying"" deep within her little girl's soul when Lord Dio utters some strange phrase and Al begins to emit a strange white glow.  It has something to do with ""Last Exile"".  Finally, get see what ""Last Exile"" is.. or what we thing it is!!!  Alex Rowe plays a deadly game of one upmanship with another highly interested bidder for ""Last Exile"".  All the while, Claus and Lavie are in the race of their lives.  Unbeknownest to them, they are decoys in the true race by Tatiana and Alistia.  The Vanship commander and her trusted sidekick must destroy the power system of the underground city where the Vanship race is taking place.  Will they succeed???
You must watch ""Discovered Attack"" to find out what happens to our three heroes and the others who are touched by these young people.",1086566400,2,980,4.791666666666667
8010456,5,B0001DCYPK,"This series is a pastiche of past anime elements reassembled and reinvented in a gorgeous and original way. The vanships and battleships will remind long-time anime fans of the gunships and air fleets of ""Nausicaa."" Not to mention a crucial image of golden fields and bright blue sky. The kid with hidden powers is a concept older than ""Akira."" How many times have we seen a cape-wearing captain? The omnipotent Guild (and series plot) has seen many reincarnations in SF (see ""Lord of Light"" by Roger Zelasny or ""Archangel"" by Sharon Shinn, e.g.). Having said all that, I think ""Last Exile"" is an addictive, engaging piece of work. The character designs, ship designs, CG sequences are simply stunning. A cut above most of the cookie-cutter stuff crowding the anime shelves. No whiny teenage characters. No one is high school uniforms. Thank the animation gods.",1082073600,3,861,4.986111111111111
8010457,5,B0001DCYPK,"Last Exile is one of the most beautiful anime ever made.  Every detail, from charicter design to the look of the ships, to the very construction of the world, has a retro-futurist look.  To use plain english, its how the future would have looked if it was designed in the Roaring '20s.
A bit of background: The world is comprised of warring nations, each compeating under strict rules laid out by a seemingly omnipotent Guild.  Stuck in the middle of this are two youths, working as air couriers to fund their racing ambitions.  Before they know it, they are swept up in events beyond their control...
Sound familiar?  It should.  Last Exile employs a variety of standard anime tropes.  There is the dark, silent comander, the plucky female side kick, strange power sources, even the 'child with strange powers'.  What makes Last Exile so fascinating is that you do not care about how cliche it seems.  You want to know what happened next.  You demand to know!  You can't get enough of the beautiful visuals, the excelent (Nipponese) voice acting, everything.
So do I recomend this DVD?  Absolutely.",1081123200,,1099,4.787234042553192
8010458,5,B0001DCYPK,"this anime is awesome!!!  there are 4 episodes included.  calculate alex, swindle, develop, and discovered attack
the silvana heads to an auction about the gateway to exile. while the auction is taking place, there is an 8 hour race that tatiana and claus are participating in.  alex is at the auction, and is unable to retrieve the gateway to exile, but dio's older sister delphine, gets it.  Lord dio comes onto the silvana and which soon enters battle against Anatory ships.  i think it is 6 anatory ships agains the silvana.  there is even more action and vanship combat in this new dvd.  i hope my review was helpful and i won't say anymore about the episodes, because i don't want to spoil it for you.  and the ending sux, because you have to wait another 2 months for the next one to come out!!!!!!!!!!!!",1081036800,,811,4.544827586206897
8010459,5,B0001DCYPK,"Typically, an anime series is neither graceful or sweeping but this one is a huge exception. Last Exile has one of the most original storylines I have seen in a while as far a anime is concerned.  There are few, if any cliches here.  Yes, the first episodes aren't the most action packed, but i think the producers spent just enough time to develop the story and characters for greater emotional impact.  The first episode gives you an idea of what normal life is like for the people of this world. Nothing in this anime is casually thrown out there.  Genuine questions arise from Volume 2 of Last Exile like, who is Alex Ross? Why is Alvis such an important part of the story?  What in the world is Dio Eraclea's role in all of this?  Who are the Guild?
I particularly like the fact that Claus is an impressive pilot and will no doubt have a significant role in proving himself and yet at the same time has not been shown as the typical 15 to 18 year-old-kid that ends up single-handedly saving everybody. Visually, GONZO did an amazing job of turning this into artwork.  The battles are full of detail, they are long enough ... to keep your attention and wonder, and they don't turn into a storyline killer.  This comes in at number 3 right now as far as my favorite animes (1. Evangelion, 2. Cowboy Bebop) and in conclusion all i have to say is that April 6th is FAR too long to wait for the 3rd volume of this anime.",1080086400,,1420,4.332075471698113
8010460,5,B0001DCYPK,"This is quite possible one of the best animes ever.  Last Exile delivers suspense, comedy, and drama all in one package.  If you have not bought the previous Last Exiles, purchase and view them, then indulge yourself in the wonder of Last Exile - Discovered Attack!",1078876800,,265,4.739130434782608
