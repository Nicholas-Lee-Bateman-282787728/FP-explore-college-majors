1738499,5,B00006AUHB,"Owning the entire As Time Goes By library so that I can watch it whenever I want is the best thing ever.  Their love story and subsequent life together never cease to cheer me up.  If you like British comedies, you will love this one that is more like watching lives in progress and waiting for the jokes to flow naturally.

Love it.....",1231632000,,337,4.317460317460317
1738500,5,B00006AUHB,"As Time Goes By is a wonderful British funny, romantic sitcom.  Anyone watching it will love it.  The characters are all wonderfuly and really bring the show together.  It's a great keepsake.  I find myself watching it every now and then all over again.",1219190400,,253,4.681818181818182
1738501,5,B00006AUHB,"For some reason the BBC packages its shows, especially the really good ones, in small bits at high prices, relatively speaking.  A U.S. series would deliver about twice the number of episodes for the price.  Of course U.S. television is largely crap so that might explain it.",1183766400,,275,4.829787234042553
1738502,1,B00006AUHB,"While I absolutely love the show on PBS, this season was mispackaged. The box and DVD were both labeled series 3, but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2. Unfortunately, I didn't try watching this disc until several months after I bought it. If you buy this, be sure you view it promptly to be certain it's the correct series.",1173657600,9,355,4.393939393939394
1738503,5,B00006AUHB,"Series 3 begins with Jean and Lionel filling their dream of a holiday in Paris.  Unfortunately, bad weather forces them to spend most of their time in the hotel.

Next Lionel's father is getting married again...at his age?  Rocky and Madge are not your usual senior citizens.  So when their wedding is rescued by bikers, it just seems appropriate.

Episode 3, Lionel and Jean decide to move in together.  But each thinks the other is moving to their flat.

Episode 4, Jean's meddling ex-sister in law Penny is visiting.  But Jean doesn't want to admit her situation with Lionel.  This includes keeping up the lie about Lionel's profession.

Episode 5, Jean and Lionel finally move in together and find out that living together has adjustments required.

Episode 6, while Jean expands her company, Lionel has financial problems.

Episode 7, Alister comes to Lionel's rescue again.  He has pitched Jean and Lionel's story to the ""Americans"".

Episode 8, Jean and Lionel travel to Hollywood to discuss the miniseries.  This is the British version of Hollywood including a gun toting crazed writer.

Episode 9, back from Hollywood, Lionel and Jean have severe jet lag but Jean must resolve who is going to run Type for You 2

Episode 10, Jean and Lionel start on the miniseries but they have different memories.

This is not the best in the series but it has some very funny moments.  And this in one of the best TV shows of the 90's.  Buy the entire series!!",1129507200,15,1455,4.744
1738504,5,B00006AUHB,"Worthwhile watching! Very well written, acted, etc. Pleasant to watch more than once. The expressions of the actors are priceless! There is such a warm feeling between the characters that even a viewer can feel.",1122940800,8,211,5.057142857142857
1738505,5,B00006AUHB,"This is a wonderfull story.  It was the best sit com ever on television.  I will be owning all the DVD""s and I watch them all the time.",1122940800,,135,3.7857142857142856
1738506,5,B00006AUHB,"""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward re-kindling slowly morphs into a warm romance.
Season 3 of the series finds things progressing nicely. After a sometimes bumpy ride toward real love, Jean & Lionel begin to take their relationship in a much more definitive direction. Alot happens this season, and it is one of the best of the series.
Episode 1 has Lionel & Jean vacationing in Paris. It is a tender and funny episode, and finds the two having to babysit some squabbling newlyweds.
Episode 2 is a classic: the wedding of Lionel's father Rocky to the charming and unique Madge. Lionel also proposes that he and Jean live together.
Episode 3 is a favorite of mine, as it shows a realistic problem that couples who want to live together face: do I give up my place, or do you give up yours? Oh, and Lionel gets carted off to the police station!
Episode 4 features a visit from Jean's sister-in-law Penny (from Jean's previous marriage), and her long-suffering husband Stephen. Those two are always a treat.
Episode 5 finally has the BIG MOVE. It has one of my favorite parts of the series in it, where Judi Dench does a superb job portraying Jean's emotions, as plans Lionel has made for them end up hurting her feelings.
Episode 6 finds Jean wanting to expand her secretarial agency.
Episode 7 is a pivotal one, for it is the first time that Alistair (Lionel's publisher) mentions that an American network is interested in producing a mini-series out of Jean & Lionel's young romance, and their eventual reuniting.  This plot line will carry-through until its resolvement in season 5.
Episode 8 takes place in Los Angeles. Lionel and Jean go there to discuss the mini-series with some rather stereotypical Hollywood types, and Lionel ends up almost losing the deal due to his attitude. I actually really liked this episode. It was a change of pace.
Episode 9: the manager of the secretarial agency's new branch is classy, industrious, sharp as a tack, and attractive: so of course Jean dislikes her from the get-go. A good revelatory episode for some of Jean's insecurities.
And, finally, episode 10 ends the season pretty quietly, as Lionel gets a new secretary to help him write the script for the mini-series, and he expresses misgivings about the whole venture (though the money for it is incentive enough for him to keep going).
""As Time Goes By"" is a comfortable show. It takes time to tell its story, and the jokes are nice and smile-inducing, rather than guffaw-laden like some shows are prone to be (not that that is always a bad thing, either). Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench help prove that there is love after 50, as if anyone over 50 needed proof of that, anyway. Curl up next to the one you love and watch this splendid show on crisp & clear DVD, and enjoy.",1025136000,103,3029,4.609259259259259

1738559,5,B00006AUHB,"I have almost always enjoyed British comedies more than those from this side of the pond, if for no other reason than that especially the older shows have so much less gutter-snipe language and sketchiness than ours do.  The comedic timing of the ensemble in ATGB is particularly striking. Judi Dench, a formidable actress by any standard, is well matched with Geoffrey Palmer and supported by Moira Brooker, Jenny Funnell, and Philip Bretherton.  While the basic premise of the series may be a bit hackneyed (two former lovers separated by a war, poor mail delivery, and 38 years later reunited), the writers and actors combine to make this a tour-de-farce for everything that can possibly be both funny and poignant simultaneously.  The saddest part of the entire situation is that Amazon Prime pulled the entire 9 seasons about a week ago (ca. 2/14/15) without any warning and my wife and I were only halfway through season 4.  Maybe, somehow, at some point, we'll all be reunited with a favorite Britcom, although it needs to be in less than the 38 years depicted in the series, given that we're both closer to 70 than to anything else and 38 years pushes our design life by more than a little.  Oh well, I guess we should have binge-watched the silly thing!",1424390400,2,1262,4.744292237442922

1738623,5,B00006AUHB,"I am a huge fan of this TV series as you can see by my reviews of Seasons 1 and 2.  Season 3 was taken up by Lionel moving in, his work on a mini-series based on his and Jean's romance and Sandy moving in.  One of the funniest scenes, for me, was the tug of war over the moving of a bed in an upstairs room.  Jean was turning the room into Lionel's study and moving the bed around to make it like a sofa and Lionel didn't want the bed moved.  Lionel was on one side of the bed and Jean was on the other.  I laughed so hard!
Excellent writing and acting.  Even Alistair is beginning to grow on me. It's a show I watch before turning in.  It's so enjoyable, fun and filled with warmth.",1416182400,,683,3.870503597122302

1738649,4,B00006AUHB,"This series from the '90s has typical wry and subtle British humor. It's definitely not Monty Python or Fawlty Towers, although the Alistair character is overplayed enough to give a hint of the off-the-wall version of British humor. This is more about clever play on word comebacks. Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer have good chemistry on screen. When you want a few chuckles, you can watch an episode or two of As Time Goes By, but start with season one.",1412812800,,453,4.675
1738650,5,B00006AUHB,"I've said this in my last review but this show is marvelously consistent with the quality of episodes, writing, and acting across all episodes... something not every TV show (especially a sitcom) can achieve.  There is still more progress in the story of the once young lovers Jean and Lionel (Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer respectively).  Series 3 has some of my favorite episodes of the whole show.  My all time favorite episode is Episode 1 where Jean and Lionel are in Paris living out a trip they planned when they were young (just not as sex-fueled as they had intended in 1953!) and the Jean is drawn to helping a young woman on her honeymoon whose had a fight with her new husband. Lionel balks, but soon finds himself helping the husband while Jean helps the wife.  It's a beautifully funny episode that I could watch again and again!  At Lionel's father's wedding to his sweetheart Madge, Lionel suggests he and Jean start living together, only for them to get tangled up in confusion as to who is moving in with whom!  In the end Lionel moves in with Jean (her place is bigger and nicer than his decent but underwhelming apartment).  Jean's daughter Judy and Lionel's publisher Alistair have an on-off thing going on that will continue for the remainder of the shows run.  Another big recurring plot is started this series when Alistair (Lionel's hyper, yuppie publisher of his dull, dull book) convinces Lionel to write a TV miniseries on his romance with Jean that will be sold to an American TV company.  Here writer Bob Larby has some fun with British perceptions of Americans and their idea of good taste on TV (in so many words: trashy, melodramatic, and bowdlerized).
The cast are always a joy to watch interact, they all just feel like nice old friends.  The plots are gently funny (let's be honest, Judi Dench wouldn't do a sitcom if it was anything slapstick or lowbrow).  This is comfort comedy at its best... and I say that as a big fan of the show.  I have nothing but love for Jean, Lionel, their family and friends, and the laughter they bring me so reliably!",1412208000,,2086,4.608108108108108

1738723,5,B00006AUHB,"We have loved this series and even find ourselves watching ones we have already seen! The humor is so enjoyable compared to what is available at times on TV now. Great actors, great series, highly recommend it!",1402790400,,210,4.702702702702703
1738724,4,B00006AUHB,I have only one word to describe this show--hilarious!  It is very down to earth and believable yet incredibly funny.  I highly recommend should you be into British humor.,1402444800,,171,4.862068965517241
1738725,5,B00006AUHB,Just great. Funny.  Adult without nudity and smut. Wish there were more true entertainment on TV rather than the Reality stupidity!,1402444800,,131,5.238095238095238
1738726,5,B00006AUHB,Just plain 'great' from every point of view . Not child centered but not a slam at them either. Excellent usage of language and human relationships. Not maudlin; pleasantly real.,1402358400,,178,4.966666666666667
1738727,5,B00006AUHB,"For anyone that loves dry, whitty, and sometimes goofy British humor then this is perfect for you.  I watch this show anytime I want a good laugh. Each episode is less than 30 minutes so perfect for quick pick me up :-)",1402099200,,219,4.214285714285714
1738728,4,B00006AUHB,"I watch this series on a regular basis for several reasons. 1) I love Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. 2) It's easy to watch. 3) It's something on which both my mother and I actually agree.
I don't appreciate 1) Philip Bretherton's constant over-acting. His character brings a cartoon-like element to the show. Could have done without that. It's not even ""flash"", it's simply goofy over-acting. 2) Why would Sandy keep dating someone (and eventually marry) with whom she had absolutely NOTHING in common. If we had seen a bit more character development (other than his love of rugby) in Harry, perhaps the betrothal would have been a bit more believable. I do like the second casting (Daniel Ryan?) for his part, though. He was much more believable as Harry and seemed to have a bit more chemistry with Sandy.

The continuity of the series is non-existent as each episode seems to take on a different atmosphere with the change and/or introduction of characters. Most are campy, some more believable. But that's what makes it easy to watch...and a good bedtime story.",1402012800,,1066,4.857142857142857
1738729,5,B00006AUHB,My husband and I loved this series!!! The acting is excellent and we always get a laugh out of every show!! It is a very simple show and reminds us of old TV... For a little escape nothing beats this.,1402012800,,200,4.025

1738733,5,B00006AUHB,"I originally downloaded this series for my sprightly 92-year old friend. I had no idea how much we would both like it. Each time we watch an episode (9 seasons), we say ""just one more?"" And smile our way through another one. It's delightful.",1401321600,,241,4.5
1738734,5,B00006AUHB,This series starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer was endearing to me when I was young and it still warm and funny. I am thankful for Amazon Prime for having it in their offerings. This is a series that will never lose its intelligent humor,1401062400,,242,4.4

1738750,5,B00006AUHB,"Not me that's for sure. Set in jolly ole' England, it's the story of Lionel and Jean! They met as young lovers and then were separated by the war only to reunite later in life. You must watch it from the beginning to get the full story however. It's a nice break during a busy day to put your feet of with a cup of tea and have a few laughs!

It was the 80's, I worked, my wife was alive and life was good. It's now the 2014's, my wife passed on several years ago, I'm retired, enjoy friends and my life.  And I still like this show.  It still has the cleverness and sweetness that drew me to it originally.  Excellent acting with good plots, and great scripts, what a joy to find it on Prime.

There is a complexity in the relationships that carries over well into reality, but at the same time there is a simplicity to the comedy that balances out everything.

The stories are fun, warm and cheery.  The actiing, directing and production is excellent.  If I may be allowed one teeny objection:  I watch Spanish telenovellas during which the love scenes set fire to the TV screen.  The Brits simply can't compare ""love scene wise.""  It takes 9 seasons before Alistair kisses Judith onscreen, and that is during their wedding.  I really wondered why they were getting married at all.",1391644800,,569,4.61

1738872,1,B00006AUHB,"There's something wrong with season 3 disks. First, as I opened the package, a disk fell out. It turns out that the black plastic which holds the disk doesn't attach well to the little clips to hold it in, I tried to re-attach, but the tiny ""knobs"" don't quite fit. As I watched the first episode, I noticed a LOT of background noise. At first I thought it must be traffic in the background, but the people were indoors. The sound, like a wavy noise which could be construed as far-away traffic, continued all the way through a few episodes, and it was obvious there was something wrong with the soundtrack. I watched until the end, and I think the last episode was without the noisy background, but still not acceptable as a purchase. I will return it for an exchange.

I have now watched all of the episodes except for 1 & 2 and 8 & 9. They are ordered. I have noticed that in season 4, it seems I am watching some of the same episodes as on season 3. I have to watch all of 3 and 4 again and write which episodes are duplicated. I saw one review which says something similar about 3 having the same episodes as 2, but I'll wait until I can get them all in order properly. In the meantime, if you notice the same things as I do, please don't hesitate to let Amazon.com know.

Of course, I love the entire series, so this has nothing to do with a great British comedy/love story. But we all want to see the series in perfect order and condition, so this duplication and background noise have to be fixed.",1386720000,,1505,4.2404181184668985
1738873,5,B00006AUHB,"Judi Dench is  quite brilliant and lovable in this show.  The rest of the cast is also spot on.  It is also refreshing to see people on television that look like real people, and not air-brushed mannequins.  I think sometime Botox interferes with an actor's ability to express emotion convincingly.  In this show one arched eyebrow can say it all.",1386201600,,347,4.716666666666667

1738897,5,B00006AUHB,"A passing glimpse of it on PBS reminded me how much I loved this series. I checked both Netflix and Hulu, but neither had it. Then I thought to check Amazon Prime and to my great joy, there it was. The player on my iPad works perfectly and it's the last thing I do each night. The characters are down-to-earth with human foibles and they show us in each episode how to love others despite our differences. Thank you for bringing it back.",1383091200,,437,4.27710843373494

1738919,5,B00006AUHB,"Leave it to the Brits to come up with a situatuation family show with not one cuss one or any porn at all. A TV show that the whole family can enjoy .It is very funny and i have watched every single show  at least once. Why can't we go back to the 50 and 60s to be able to watch good TV shows that we would allow all the family to watch. Some of you my age will remember Little Beaver and Father Knpws Best and the like. What has happened to our country? Why is it now Ok for such things as Same Sex Marriage and opnly homosexual activity? ""They"" are trying to destroy our morals, our country and our military.

They are good people and there is nothing cruel or even cutting in the relationships, which is a pleasant change from modern ""relationships"". I heard Geoffrey Palmer say that Judi Dench was just SO NICE that it was impossible to say anything against her.  That attitude informs the entire series.",1379030400,,503,4.905882352941177

But, I never grow tired of watching ATGO. it's kinda' like I Love Lucy, you know all the lines, but love seeing it again as the acting is so good.",1363219200,,393,4.116883116883117

1739015,5,B00006AUHB,"I have enjoyed watching the entire series. My 92 year old Mother turned me on to them and it is so much fun to watch them together with her and my sisters, very enjoyable family night. Figured they would be a little boring for my taste but totally enjoy. Really puts a smile on your face and in your heart.",1363046400,,306,4.116666666666666

1739038,5,B00006AUHB,"This is one of the best TV comedies made. The BBC did a great job with the writing and choosing the cast. They all interact so well together that I forget that it is just a TV show. Judi Dench has always been a favorite of mine, and Geoffrey Palmer is a wonderful actor. They act so well together that they seem like a real couple. It has a romantic story line full of humor and wit that women will love. My husband & teenage sons also enjoy watching this show.  It is a classic that one can watch repeatedly. Reality TV is the worst and features no talent what-so-ever, but this show demonstrates true acting abilities. I highly recommend this show but do start at season 1. Enjoy!",1361491200,,682,4.286821705426356

The DVD arrived when scheduled with a few scratches and smudges on it, and the case was somewhat worn.

1739068,5,B00006AUHB,This is a series that we have enjoyed on PBS and decided we wanted to continue to enjoy it on the evenings it is preempted and after is has run it's course as a program.  You could count on one hand the number of dvds we have purchased for our own entertainment but this series is so outstanding we decided we had to have it. Charming and innovative dialogue well presented by the cast of stars with whom one quickly falls in love.,1321574400,5,431,4.192771084337349
1739069,5,B00006AUHB,"For full disclosure I must tell you that I am a Judi Dench fan.  I enjoyed her in ""Four in the Morning"", ""Macbeth"", and ""Shakespeare in Love"" just to name a few.  As far as I am concerned, she is the most accomplished dramatic actress of the twentieth century.  Having said that, it is not dramatic acting that is her strongest point: comedy is, and ""As Time Goes By"" is the apex of her comedic career.  She and Jeffery Palmer ""jell"", and the rest of the cast are outstanding as well.  This is a light comedy series that keeps the audience laughing and, although a significant part of the plot involves Jean and Lionel ""living together"", it is so well done that the whole family can enjoy it.  That is the reason it has so many episodes; it ran for nine series, 1991 to 2002.",1320883200,2,775,4.310344827586207
1739070,5,B00006AUHB,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Season 3 of As Time Goes By.

1739074,4,B00006AUHB,"I bought this with great anticipation, the series is excellent and I was looking forward to having it all  on DVD.  To begin with it isn't all of the series, the last two segments are missing. I also received 2 of the series one and two and none of series 3 and had to order that seperately. I do realize it wasn't Amazon's fault that the packing of the series was faulty but If a series is described as complete It really should be complete.  Complete means everything not everything except some of it. I have had to seperately order the last two segments. Somewhat annoying.  Amazon should make clear what is being offered for sale.",1240790400,10,634,4.439655172413793

7966407,3,B00006AUHB,"Weakest ""series"" or season yet of the program. The series is quite nice, though the storyline has grown highly imperfect. Though Lionel has some terrific lines, the story arc has become rather dimwitted, with Lionel having become a petulant child. The first half of season or ""series"" 3 is beset by senseless arguments between the two leads, Jean and Lionel, which aren't believable given how intelligent the leads, the characters, were in ""series"" 1 and 2. The second half of ""series"" 3 is more - too much! - handholding of Lionel through the course of the career he has made for himself of bad writing. Why can't Lionel take care of his writing and business matters? It's a wonder he managed to have a successful coffee planting and selling business in Kenya. He's handed everything, in terms of his career and more, on a silver platter, and yet he needs Jean to hold his hand through every opportunity given him by Alistair, who should have more important things to do than to be there for every Lionel-mollycoddling emergency. And, by the way, when was Alistair not only a publisher but also high up, very high up, in the television production business? These don't instantaneously go together. I also don't understand, about the series itself, why in a secretary procurement agency, there are never to be seen any secretaries, other than Jean's own personal secretaries?",1494806400,,1375,4.880341880341881
