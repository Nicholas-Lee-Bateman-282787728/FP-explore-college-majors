8489363,5,B0023TGXL6,"I got this video mostly to whet my current fixation with Yosemite and primarily El Capitan. And whet it did :) The speed ascent by Yuji Hirayama and Hans Florine is spectacularly shot; offering great insight into speed climbing and big wall climbing in general. It's amazing that the first ascent of the Captain took over 44 days and these guys are now doing in under three hours !!! Mind boggling :) Yuji is a freakin machine :)

The Astroman free climb by Alex Honnold is pretty cool. There's some bouldering thrown in as well.

Great film.",1250467200,4,542,4.577319587628866
