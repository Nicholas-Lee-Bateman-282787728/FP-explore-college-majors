He has a  by the book 2  dvd, which I like a little better because of the song list... [its less ragtime blues than #1 is] all in all I would recommend both if your serious about learning finger picking blues...",1464912000,,360,4.279411764705882
8018820,5,B0001ZJQ86,Clearly presented instrumentation by Roy.  Lots of challenge keeps it fresh and addictive!  A great way to learn some moderate blues.,1442188800,,133,5.285714285714286
8018821,5,B0001ZJQ86,I have been playing guitar for a long time on and off..i have always loved playing fingerpicking style ..but forced myself to play with a pick..now mr. Bookbinder has changed me forever..he is a great teacher and very generous with his with his lessons..very cool stuff to get into...thanks,1380931200,,290,4.938775510204081
8018822,5,B0001ZJQ86,Material is definitely intermediate and some knowledge of thumb picking blues would be helpful. He has a wonderful wit and seems like the kind of guy you would just like to hang out with....... Lessons are delivered in a relaxed and easy going manner with a wealth of licks and tricks to put that icing on your playing...Thank you Roy you changed my life,1367280000,,354,4.546875
8018823,4,B0001ZJQ86,"I love me some fingerstyle rag/blues, and Mr. Roy Book Binder is a fabulous player / teacher / raconteur. It's worth buying the DVD just for his banter, but the music is solid gold. He starts out with a Rag in C, starting with basic chords - C, Long A, Dmin, and G, and over the course of the DVD he shows you dozens of ""tricks"" (i.e. picking patterns) that can be used to create spontaneous variations off the cuff - very fun indeed! I really really want to give this 5 stars, but unfortunately, Mark Harmon's lazy and incredibly terrible tabs do not even try to cover the vast majority of these tricks. I have been playing long enough that I can lift these by ear, but I really feel for the person who wants to learn but just can't get it.

What this does is turn a lesson that is aimed at intermediate players into a lesson which fruits, sadly, will only be revealed to more experienced players.

To sum up, DVD GOOD, tab/sheet music BAD. Caveat Emptor. Viva Roy!!",1316995200,6,967,4.3076923076923075
8018824,5,B0001ZJQ86,"Roy Book Binder is one of the best blues men I've ever got to hang out with. Now, when I say that, I don't mean I actually hung out with him... Watching this dvd is like sitting at the knee of a master. If you are an accomplished player who knows idiomatic guitar playing, this dvd will lend you insights that are mind blowing.
I love the entire package. The jokes, the delivery, everything. I'm so glad that I bought this dvd.
However, if you are a new player, or, for example, you don't know a fingering for the D maj in 7h position (starting on the G: 7-7-10, fun. 1-3-1), then this is not the video for you. Go CAGED (look for Fretboard Logic), learn the fretboard, learn theory, do some Happy Traum (another really great teacher) and get confident in your playing. Once you can accompany yourself, you will be ready for this excellent peice of work...

If you are experienced, I can tell you that this is the BEST instructional video that I've ever owned for fingerstyle guitar. While Happy is really good (I recommend his works because you are never as good as you could be), Roy Book Binder pulls out all of the stops and does it in a way that will make you just laugh... both at him, yourself, and how amazing he plays. I am just blown away!",1243555200,5,1249,4.314893617021276
8018825,5,B0001ZJQ86,"I have just started to learn fingerstyle acoustic blues.  I have been working out of two (2) books both found on Amazon: 1) Beginning Fingerstyle Blues Guitar by Berle and Galbo and 2) Fingerstyle Blues Songbook by Steve James - both excellent and great for the beginner.  But I was getting to the point that I wanted something a little extra - some coaching that I could get into and learn from.  This is the DVD lesson that will do that (for me and you!).  Roy is easy going, and he makes learning fun.  He starts slow and adds licks, flourishes, turn-arounds and endings and does it in a way that will have you laughing and learning and in a bit - amazed that you are doing it as well.  My only comment that could even be a bit negative is in reply to his statement that he wonders why any one would want to play like him, well I understand that we need to devote time and study and having fun so that we can sound like ourselves, but Roy, it would be wonderful if we could play (and sound) just a bit like you.  Highly recommended!!!!!",1238803200,5,1039,4.217171717171717
8018826,5,B0001ZJQ86,"If you love acoustic blues, but don't know how to play, you've come upon a great DVD.  To get started, begin with Happy Traum's Easy Blues (part 1 and part 2---) then move on to this classic, funny, self-abasing blues guitarist.  Roy Book Binder is a treasure as a guitar teacher and if you only learn ONE song from this DVD, you will have learned not simply a great song, and a fun song, but more so, you will have learned to improvise and enjoy your guitar as Roy encourages you to take chances, invent, and enjoy yourself.  what a treat!",1178755200,2,540,4.326732673267327
