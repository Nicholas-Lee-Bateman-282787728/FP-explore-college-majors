7825857,5,6302457378,"From Rankin/Bass, the creators of holiday staples such as ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" & ""Mad Monster Party"", comes yet another gem filmed in their trademark ""Animagic"" stop-motion animation process. This movie, which was made at the same time as ""Rudolph"" was not a made-for-TV special, but a full-length feature released in theaters.

It concerns a young boy, Willy, who learns of the Mad Professor Rasputin Van Rotton's plans to go back into time so that he can take credit for different feats and inventions (such as the discovery of America, invention of fire, etc...) by beating the real heroes to the punch. I guess he felt that building the world's first time machine would not provide enough stature! Anyway, with the help of a stereotypical Spanish monkey, Pablo, who takes great pride in announcing the fact that he is ""one great lateen luvur"" (that's ""latin lover"" in Spanish monkey talk), Willy builds his own ""Magic Machine"" and travels through the ages to foil the Mad Professor's plans just in the nick of time.

Packed with dinosaurs, mad professors, the wild west, cavemen, knights, pirates, Indians, cowboys and many other such subjects, this is sure to delight any young boy (well.... maybe any young boy from the 1950's) but may be a bit tedious for adults if they are not a fan of stop-motion animation. But if you were a young boy in the 50's AND are a stop-motion fan then this movie with its retro-puppet-appeal will rock your world!!! I was born in the '70's and it certainly rocked mine!!

By now, everything made by Rankin/Bass SHOULD be readily available on DVD. Unfortunately, many are not...including this classic kiddie matinee attraction. Fans of the company's other works should not be disappointed by this one.",1282780800,2,1780,4.966442953020135
7825858,5,6302457378,"This is another great example of Rankin/Bass at their best! I am so grateful to have grown up with the Rankin/Bass family of magical movies!!! Nothing can compare to them! This film will make your kids think! Unlike so many kids shows today, this wonderfully animated film tries to immerse kids in thought and hopefully take it a step further to learn more about history. It's fun for another reason, as well... IT'S STOP MOTION ANIMATION! How cool is that? I remember wishing I could play with the actual puppets used to make the Rankin/Bass AniMagic films. There is something so very tangible about these treasured films! It's great that they are available on DVD and VHS for future generations to enjoy!",1276300800,2,706,4.795081967213115
7825859,4,6302457378,"This is a ""thinking child's"" animation and musical. Using a time machine as a device to examine historical situations, the heros and a power-mad villain joke and sing from beginning to end. My sisters and I memorized all the songs, some of which I can remember 30 years later. Unlike Saturday cartoons then and now, the scenery doesn't just serve as a backdrop for cliches: the charaters interact meaningfully.",973123200,4,410,4.956521739130435
