8356307,1,B0028JH6QW,This is a bad massacred short of an hour long show that was very good. I don't know why they bothered to put out this 15 minute version when they should have printed the whole hour show. I was very displeased when I got it and viewed it. I have seen the original show and thought that was what I was purchasing.,1292198400,4,311,4.032258064516129
8356308,2,B0028JH6QW,"I'm a big fan of the Edmund Fitzgerald story, and was excited to see that my favorite documentary on the shipwreck finally was released on DVD -- sort of.  I didn't read the description very well when I purchased it, and only now realize that this is a 15 minute version.  The actual documentary is 45 minutes long, and includes a history of the ship (with video of its launch), footage of news reports about the sinking, discussions with family members and the Coast Guard, as well as Arthur Anderson's captain, who was following 'Big Fitz' on that fateful night.

This shortened version focuses on the recovery of the ship's bell and the memorial ceremony, but that's about it.  I'm guessing there were copyright issues that couldn't be worked out.  What a shame.  It is a great and moving documentary in it's complete form.  The DVD also includes a few slides of the expeditions and The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, but even those are brief.  Disappointing experence after viewing this package.",1284163200,5,998,4.795321637426901
