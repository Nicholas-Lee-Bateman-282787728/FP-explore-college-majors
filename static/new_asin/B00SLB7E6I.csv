8698799,2,B00SLB7E6I,"This isn't exactly the film described in the Amazon review or pictured on the cover. This review contains plot spoilers, but don't worry, the film wasn't that good. The 1,000's of raptors and dinosaurs are not set loose on LA until the end scenes. That would have been a great film.

In this film, CG Raptors get loose in an LA city jail, because somehow that is where the military swaps Raptors. Exactly how and why the military has dinosaurs is one of those silly plot points that never need explaining. Three hot sorority sisters, a couple of lesbians and a flake are in the ladies' side of the prison while a polite serial rapist and killer is on the guy's side. The prison doors all come open while 3 raptors bite off the heads of people. Regular automatic weapons don't seem to work, only large hand held cannons which can blow the Raptor's head off seems to work. Of course most of the military working with the dinosaurs have the automatic weapon.

Now I did like the characters we meet in prison. It added to what would otherwise be a boring CG raptor film.

Sorority girl: ""These are dinosaurs. This is a prison. I think we're a little out of our element.""

The film is Asylum grade, including the occasional gaff.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some bikini shots. Heads torn off. Blood splatter on lens. PG-13 stuff.",1422662400,,1332,4.533333333333333
