The funimations and other media might produce lower priced sets but they try and push too many episodes onto 1 disc lowering the quality, the dubbing and voice acting is really really bad and the boxes they are in are cheaply made.  Aniplex gives us a premium boxed product.  Also, the high prices help to pay for the high price of creating the series.  Also, in Japan they don't have a lot of room to put 1000's of anime and manga, so they high price of the show makes it that people only buy those shows that they really really love.  If its too expensive for you just watch it on netflix or online somewhere and be happy with that experience.  If you go to broadway you pay like 300-1000 bucks and u don't get to take the show home with you, experience it once and that it.  if you support the shows you like even if they are expensive then that will tell the creators to make more shows like that and in the higher quality.",1470355200,,1067,4.326633165829146

Its a great show and has so many different layers that go beyond the plot of the show which ended up selling me. Aniplex is expensive but due to the limited amount they print, they are forced to set the price as high as they do.",1404345600,4,325,3.8656716417910446
8647667,5,B00J3BDZMC,"This is one of the most engaging and interesting stories I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Just like the first set, Aniplex unfortunately slapped a MASSIVE price tag on it which is nothing new from them, however the series itself is outstanding and worth your time.",1395964800,2,272,4.6875
8647668,1,B00J3BDZMC,"You expect anybody to buy half the season in DVD for $90 dollars?

There are other shows which sell the whole season in blu-ray for $45 dollars. You are the reason why nobody buys, not piracy.",1395705600,10,192,4.333333333333333
