2546668,5,B000EXZKS0,"ECW Collector's Pack is something you should pick up because not only does it have one of the greatest ppvs in the past three years, ECW One Night Stand, but you also get one of the greatest documentaries on the rise and fall of one of the most popular wrestling brands that unfortunately went out of business back in 2001. [Rumor has it though ECW will reform later this year in September]

I personally have both these DVDS that I bought over the past two years, but since it's harder to find the Rise and Fall of ECW on DVD nowadays, definately pick this up. Both DVDS are great to own...

ECW ONE NIGHT STAND[2005]

This took place on June 12th, 2005 and was ECW's first ever ppv since 2001. A lot of names reappeared that hadn't been seen on national TV in a long time as well as some five star matches took place.

Matches include:

Lance Storm vs. Chris Jericho: Great technical battle. Justin Credible smacks Jericho with a singapore cane, which causes Jericho to lose, as the Impact Players reunite.

Little Guido [Nunzio] vs. Tajiri vs. Super Crazy: Fast paced and INSANE moonsault off a balcony by Super Crazy onto the entire FBI

Rey Mysterio vs. Psichosis: Not as good as you might think, but some cool moves nonetheless such as Rey jumping off the top turnbuckle into Psichosis in the crowd!

Sabu vs. Rhino: Chairs, high flying moves and a great ending involving Sabu leg dropping Rhyno through a table!! Sabu wins with the help of Rob Van Dam and Bill Alphonso.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero [RIP]: Great technical battle by these two men. The last match on ppv they would have together.

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome: Great, great match. Both men use tables and chairs on each other. Awesome even powerbombed Tanaka over the tope rope through a table on the outside!!

The Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman: What a war. So many weapons were used, even a cheese grater! Watch a VICIOUS street sign shot to the head by Bubba Ray onto Dreamer! Then watch Sandman give the Rolling Rock to Devon on top of a ladder. The ending has Tommy being powerbombed through a FLAMING table!! ""OH MY GOD!"" as Joey Styles would say...

At the end of the night Stone Cold Steve Austin makes his way to ringside and starts a wild brawl between the Raw and Smackdown superstars with the ECW wrestlers. The infamous JBL/Blue Meanie fight takes place in the brawl, see if you can see Meanie take a hard punch in the eye!

Extras include a clip on the ""ECW Funeral"" by Eric Bischoff

Clips hyping the returns of: Sabu, The Sandman, RVD, the Dudley Boyz, and Tommy Dreamer

Clips of ECW fans outside the ring talking about their ECW experiences

And one of the worst things you can actually hear as JBL was in the ppv as well during the WWE invasion of ECW storyline in which he rips into everything the ECW ppv held. DO NOT LISTEN TO IT [At least that is my advice]

THE RISE AND FALL OF ECW DOCUMENTARY:

This is a great 3 hour story of the rise of a little promotion held in a bingo hall in South Philadelphia, run by a man named Paul Heyman. In this documentary you will see interviews with: Paul Heyman, Tommy Dreamer, Taz, RVD, Rhyno, The Dudley Boyz, Al Snow, Stevie Richards, Nunzio, Chris Jericho, Dawn Marie, Kurt Angle, and even Vince McMahon.

Hear about several famous moments in ECW History such as:

The first ever triple threat match to take place in America when ""The Night The Line Was Crossed"" occured, what Heyman thinks of Eric Bischoff for coming into ECW and taking several top talent for WCW. Hear about the infamous crucifixion moment between the Sandman and Raven, as well as the time New Jack beat a wrestler within an inch of his life [Literally!]

Plus you will see great ECW footage such as: Flaming Tables Matches, Weapons Matches, Lucha Libre, plenty of table spots, some old Monday Night Raw footage back in the 90's when ECW first invaded, as well as a styrafoam head ""snow storm"" with Al Snow in the ring [No pun intended]

Extras include 7 different matches [in their entirety]

ECW Tag Team Champioships
2 out of 3 falls dog collar match
The Pitbulls vs. Raven and Stevie Richards [Champions]:
Wild brawl that had a lot of tables in it. Pitbull 2 gets piledriven through a table in the ring, then Stevie Richards gets suplexed through another table. Raven even had a pitbull on top of two tables and tried to drive him right through them, but one didn't break. The end involves Tommy Dreamer and the Dudley Boyz [Different Dudleys] interfering. 8/10 The Pitbulls win after a long ending.

Psichosis vs. Rey Msyterio:
Great 2 out of 3 falls match. The first fall is short, but the second and third get longer and longer. Highlights include some suicide dives over the top rope into the crowd by both men. Then Rey puts the chair over Psichosis' head and drives him into the ring posts, almost decapitating him! Psichosis even drives Mysterio through two tables!! 10/10 Psichosis wins and the crowd gives Mysterio a standing ovation!

ECW World Heavyweight Championship
Ladder Match
Mikey Whipwreck vs. The Sandman [Champion]:
Funny promo by Steve Austin [Yes, that Steve Austin] before the match started and he rips into both men saying he will be the next champ after whoever wins. The match is short but some hard hitting moves such as Mikey getting thrown onto the ladder several times, his head took a lot of punishment. Watch Sandman slip as he tries to do a flip into the ring! 8/10 Mikey wins and many wrestlers celebrate with him!

ECW Television Championship
Taz [Champion] vs. Bam Bam Bigelow:
This was the match where both men crash through the ring floor to the ground! The crowd was surprisingly dead throughout this match, but there were some good weapon use. 8/10 Bam Bam wins after pulling Taz out from under the ring and pins him.

ECW Television Championship
Sabu vs. 2 Cold Scorpio [Champion]:
Best match in the extras. This was for the ECW Television title. 30 minute classic in which chairs, and technical wrestling are used. Sabu even does a forward summersault off the top rope and MISSES Scorpio in the crowd and crashes on top of a table!!! Listen to Joey Styles after that spot, it's hysterical what he says 11/10 The match ends in a draw and the ECW TV title stays with the champion.

Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer;
This match went all throughout the crowd. Tables were broken by both men as they slammed each other into them behind the crowd. Alcohol was also used as Tommy spits a drink right in Raven's face. Some interference by several people, but Tommy finally pins Raven in their famous feud. The post match action has an invasion by Sabu, RVD, Bill Alfonso, and of all people, Jerry The King Lawler! The entire ECW locker room empties to fight the invaders, and only Taz is able to clear the ring after everyone else is wiped out! 9/10

ECW Television Championship
Rob Van Dam [Champion] vs. Jerry Lynn:
Second best match on the DVD. If you have RVD's DVD ""One Of A Kind"" you know what Jerry Lynn and RVD can do in the ring, and this is no different! Great technical wrestling and high flying moves. RVD even does a sunset flip out of the ring and powerbombs Jerry Lynn through a table! 9.5/10 RVD wins but both men shake hands after the match.

These are the two disks that you are 100% guaranteed to get if you buy this collector's set. I just wish the newest DVD, ""Bloodsport"" was included because that would have been perfect. Oh well, this pack is still highly recommended...",1146614400,17,7454,4.561797752808989

2546682,4,B000EXZKS0,"As everyone here has said, this is a great combo pack to own. You learn tons from the Rise & Fall DVD, many things that you wouldn't even imagine wrestlers doing. I'm going to keep this short and sweet and just say that it is an awesome look back at some great moments.
The only problem I have with this is that (more than likely) WWE, took Sandman's awesome entrance to Metallica's, Enter Sandman, and replaced it with another song. This has been one of my favorite entrances just because it showed all the fans singing along to it as they showed their love towards Sandman and the rest of ECW. The good thing is that the REAL entrance is on youtube.",1339804800,,651,4.344262295081967
2546683,5,B000EXZKS0,"As an ECW fan since 1995, despite the great reviews, I had chosen to skip viewing these titles as to not ruin my memories.
 When I finally decided to view ""The Rise and Fall..."" this 2 pack offered by far the best value as it came with ""One Night Stand"" and was actually far less expensive than either title alone.
 Despite ""living through it all"" I actually learned a few things about the promotion and was able to relive some classic ECW moments. The bonus features alone were worth the cost.
 ONS was an amazing show, with a solid roster of ECW Originals as well as the infamous JBL/Blue Meanie shoot.
  Though the items come packed together, they are individually wrapped leaving you to add the one you're after and sell the one you have if needed.",1338940800,,752,4.45985401459854
2546684,5,B000EXZKS0,"Having long heard of Extreme Championship Wrestling, I remained rather ignorant of who people like Sandman, Raven, and Tommy Dreamer were. Seeing this available, I ordered it and was not disappointed. Both DVDs provided action-packed hours of what seem to be classic ECW moments. If you are either looking to see what all the ECW stuff was about or you loved ECW and want to recollect, I'd suggest watching it. You will enjoy it.",1336089600,,429,4.8108108108108105
2546685,3,B000EXZKS0,"The title says it all.  The ECW collector pack comes with the documentary of the ECW and ECW: One-Night Stand.

I am a fan of documentaries.  I thought The Rise and Fall of the ECW was well done and interesting.  There are tibits about the promotion that casual fans would never have known.  I definitely think it is worth the money.

ECW: One-Night Stand was a money grab by the WWE.  THe WWE bought the ECW because of the popularity of the extreme style of wrestling that was slowly growing.  They brought in a lot of the old ECW wrestlers and while it was fun to see them....it wasn't the same and most of the PPV was focused on the WWE superstars showing up and threatening to disrupt the show rather than on the actual ECW wrestler. It was just a disappointmet and is actually a dvd I gave away.",1327708800,,800,4.286666666666667
2546686,5,B000EXZKS0,"I love the documentary, but the ECW One Night Stand is a pretty much flawless event. It is pure ECW at it's finest. The Benoit vs Guerrero match was dull, but couldn't hold back this amazing card. If you like wrestling, you will love this DVD pack",1308873600,,247,4.276595744680851
2546687,5,B000EXZKS0,"I became a wrestling fan 4 or 5 years ago, long after the demise of ECW.  So whenever I heard someone talk about how great ECW was, the only reference that I had was One Night Stand 2006, and the newly resurrected ECW on Sci-Fi.  So when I bought and watched the Rise & Fall Of ECW, I finally got a taste of why people had such good memories of the old ECW.  This documentary did a great job of giving a great synopsis of the entire time that ECW was in existence.  And the fact that they included many of the matches that were referenced in the documentary on the second disk.  And the fact that they included the first One Night Stand (which was much better than the 2006 event) was great.  My only criticism was that in the Main Event, The Sandman's theme music was edited.  Originally they played Metallica's Sandman, with all of the ECW fans singing right along with it.  On the DVD though, they have some ""Sandman-like"" riff played over and over, and the fans' cheers sound muted.  All in all 9.5/10",1212105600,,1005,4.303191489361702
2546688,5,B000EXZKS0,"THE RISE OF FALL OF ECW:
This was the DVD that started it all as it was selling out everywhere & became the second highest selling DVD in WWE history as told by former ECW alumni (that was under contract with WWE at the time) along with others such as Kurt Angle, ECW Producer Rob Buffone, ex-WCW President Eric Bischoff, and Vince McMahon. The documentary tells the story of Paul Heyman coming into the company, Eastern Championship Wrestling becoming EXTREME, the audience influence, the impact ECW had on wrestling in the U.S. (pure wrestling & lucha libre) during the ""Monday Night Wars"", the beginning of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin in ECW, the story of the first PPV, their relationship with WWE that nobody really knew about, the TNN deal, how a WWE superstar faced a WCW wrestler for the ECW Championship, and all the problems leading up to the downfall of ECW. You also had profiles on ECW alumni like Public Enemy, Tommy Dreamer, Sandman, Taz, Sabu, Cactus Jack, Raven and others along with personal stories involving their characters plus never before seen footage such as Heyman firing Sabu & the Sandman crucifixion. DVD extras include Stevie Richards apologizing for the way he left ECW, Tazz talking about his phone call to Paul Heyman before his WWE debut, Chris Jericho's story about ""Paul Heyman: Talent Agent."" Hidden extras include a classic ""Pulp Fiction"" montage, the pre-match Taz/Bam Bam Bigelow history video package, RVD showing his scar from his match against Jerry Lynn, and Mikey Whipwreck training with the Public Enemy.

Matches include a 2 Out Of 3 Falls Dog Collar Match with Tag Team Champions Raven & Stevie Richards vs. Pitbulls, Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Psichosis in a 2 Out Of 3 Falls Match, ECW Champion Sandman vs. Mikey Whipwreck in a Ladder Match with a special appearance from Steve Austin, Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu, Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven from WrestlePalooza '97 with alternative commentary by Dreamer & Johnathan Coachman, Television Champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bieglow from Living Dangerously '98 with alternative commentary by Tazz & Michael Cole, and Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn from Hardcore Heaven '99 with alternative commentary by RVD & Michael Cole.

ONE NIGHT STAND 2005:
After the highly successful sales of the ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" DVD, WWE held a reunion show for ECW called One Night Stand from the site of the final ECW PPV in Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Special appearances were made throughout the night by ECW alumni such as the bWo, Bill Alfonzo & Rob Van Dam, Kid Kash, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten, Al Snow & Head, the biggest gathering of F.B.I. members in ECW history, Joel Gertner, Mikey Whipwreck & the Sinister Minister, Spike Dudley, Justin Credible, Jason, Francine, Beulah, Pitbull #2, Danny Doring & Roadkill, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Taz, and Paul Heyman along with ""anti-ECW"" crusaders watched from the balcony including Eric Bischoff & J.B.L. & Edge & Kurt Angle. DVD extras include comments from the fans before the event, all the commercials & superstar spotlights featuring Tommy Dreamer & Sandman & Sabu & Rob Van Dam & Dudley Boyz, highlights from the ECW funeral on RAW, and a ""J.B.L. alternative commentary"" feature in which J.B.L. was miked throughout the event as you just hear the comments from him & those around him. Matches include Lance Storm's retirement match vs. Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio vs. Psychosis, Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido, Sabu vs. Rhyno, Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero, Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome, and Tommy Dreamer & Sandman vs. Dudley Boyz.

You get two of the greatest WWE DVD releases along together for the great bargain price.  This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you don't already have both of these but if you do, go ahead & skip it because there's nothing new.",1154563200,6,3828,4.902777777777778
