4989640,5,B006HGXGWU,"but I'll try not to play the spoiler. Suffice it to say, the full meaning of Take Shelter rests perilously upon the final scene, where the primary issue of the film--the sanity of the protagonist--is seemingly resolved. A straight-forward reading of that scene yields a richness of social implication; allegorical or ironic readings yield nothing but the fruit of a well-acted psycho-suspense thriller.

Appearances aside, this is not a film about the private affairs of a married couple, and this is not a film that ends on a note of discontinuity. The whole point of the film is that the line between private anguish and public life is an illusion; the whole point of the ending is that it is the logical outcome of a psychological process that has been building up for two hours on screen.

As far as I'm concerned, Take Shelter is about the challenge of people coming together in the face of an impending political catastrophe, about forging a meeting-of-minds that requires nothing less than extraordinary courage and empathy from all of us, as we strive to overcome the all-but-unbridgeable gaps between our various subjective experiences of the world. In this sense, the super-natural elements in Take Shelter appear only superficially in the sky; the real miracle is in what happens between two human beings--married or unmarried, it makes no difference--by the end of the film.

 In my view, Take Shelter is far and away the most important meta-political film of this young century.",1321142400,4,1491,5.0
4989641,5,B006HGXGWU,"Jeff Nichols' ""Take Shelter"" is a movie that reverberates in your mind for days after you've seen it. It's the story of Curtis (Michael Shannon), a road construction worker who lives in a small northern Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and their small, hearing-impaired daughter Hannah. Curtis and Samantha live a quiet, outwardly contented life, and between their savings and Curtis' health insurance they plan soon to get Hannah the operation that will allow her to hear.

But soon Curtis is beset with visions and nightmares. Rain the color and texture of motor oil falls from the sky; his beloved old dog attacks him viciously; strange creatures menace him and Hannah; birds fly in spiraling, evil-looking flocks, then suddenly fall dead to the ground. Slowly Curtis becomes convinced these nightmares are premonitory of a cataclysmic tornado. He starts borrowing equipment from work and spending his family's savings to build a state-of-the-art tornado shelter in his yard, infuriating Samantha and alienating his friends in the process.

Even Curtis is aware that his visions might be the sign of an unbalanced mind; his mother (Kathy Baker) was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic when she was about the age he is now. But talking to his mother provides no answers, and neither do the pathetically bare-bones mental health services available in his town.

This is Nichols' second feature. His first--""Shotgun Stories,"" which also starred Shannon--had many fine things in it but suffered from too many lingering landscape shots. In ""Take Shelter,"" however, the flat, foreboding Ohio landscape is virtually a character, and the ever-more-threatening storm clouds Curtis sees on the horizon add immeasurably to the building suspense. Nichols' screenplay is airtight, and the performances could not be bettered. Shannon, with his craggy, haunted face. delivers an unforgettable performance, and Chastain--who is having a miracle year as an actress--stands shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

The story culminates in a horrifying yet touching scene that intertwines the twin plot threads of weather-borne terror and family love. However, Nichols adds a coda to the story that I'm still trying to make up my mind about. That coda could be interpreted as vindication, as parable, or as a plain sick joke. No matter. ""Take Shelter"" is a breathtaking cinematic experience, and no one who sees it will forget it.",1320883200,8,2426,5.326370757180157
4989642,5,B006HGXGWU,"Looking for a cool, quirky little indie film that plays with notions of desperate sanity and ancient visionary gifts?  Don't miss writer/director Jeff Nichols' timely and disturbing meditation about the growing, apparent madness of Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon), a good, heartland American husband and father trying to cope with family issues - his six year old daughter is deaf and needs surgery - escalating financial problems and private, apocalyptic nightmares.

There's a pervasive malevolence in this mostly quiet melodrama that becomes increasingly unsettling as the dreams become more frequent and vivid; so much so that they cause Curtis to secretly borrow money to build a new storm shelter in their yard.  When Curtis confides his horrifying night-visions to his loving wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) is not happy with this turn of events and recognizes that her husband may need professional help.  And then he loses his job.  But the dreams persist.

Michael Shannon is astonishing as Curtis LaForche.  And Jessica Chastain shows her growing bewilderment, anger and anxiety in her yes and body language even when there are no spoken words.  Shannon and Chastain are exceptional as the concerned couple.  There's never a false moment.  The special effects are organic and extremely effective.

This amazingly well-crafted story and film taps into our collective concerns about our fragile, shared reality.  Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski mastered this particular filmic sense of shaping and focusing a feeling of nameless dread into an ever-sharper series of events that go further than our fears.  Movies are dreams made real, and like INCEPTION, this one delivers a layered drama of fractured reality and madness actualized.  Are we what we secretly perceive? Or fear? Perhaps.

Here's simply the best drama of the year so far (as of this writing 1 November 2011).",1320537600,3,1889,5.33445945945946

The challenges this places on his relationships with his wife, daughter, best friend, and everyone in his community are complex and beautifully acted.

I watched the film hoping to see a science fiction tale.  It turned out to be something else, so I'm disappointed.

4989730,5,B006HGXGWU,"One of my interns recommended this film to me. We have had discussions about reality vs fantasy/delusion, and this film directly addresses the issue in a subtle realistic way. The main character, Curtis, begins having vivid dreams about a terrible storm and acts on these dreams. At the same time he is aware that his mother's onset of paranoid schizophrenia occurred at the same stage in life as he currently finds himself. The tragic nature of the dreams and his possible loss of sanity motivates him to protect his family from this information. He attempts to deal with it through his doctor and professionals, but his preoccupation and odd behavior are evident and undermine his family relationships. He finally shares what is happening with his wife, who is not only supportive but therapeutic as well--her response is quietly heroic. What the audience experiences is the ambivalence that accompanies witnessing extraordinary private events. Events that are not accessible to one's peers. ""A Beautiful Mind"" does the same but without the ambivalence; John Nash, the protagonist of that film, lost the  self-awareness necessary to know that his experience was a private event. He later trusts others to help him with this by asking if they can see possibly hallucinated characters. At the end of ""Take Shelter"" the madness vs vision dilemma appears resolved when Curtis' daughter and wife see the storm as well--the vision is now a shared experience. However, the last scene is vague enough that the audience can construe it as either another Curtis hallucination or as verification (see the many online discussions of the film). All in all this fascinating film depicts the complex emotions and ambiguity that accompany: ""Is this real or am I crazy?"" The answer is hard to say, but the interesting part is how you resolve it.

4989731,3,B006HGXGWU,"When people portray a movie as ""extremely realistic"" that's typically a very good thing. Unfortunately, this movie was realistic in the way that if you were to film a day in the life of a person....even an extraordinary person, after enough tooth brushings, loading of dishwashers, going to construction jobs, mundane breakfasts, (you get the picture), it just becomes a bit boring and hard to watch. They did sprinkle some interesting bits between, but not enough to keep you at the edge of your seat (or for me, even able to watch it consecutively, as I had to keep stopping and starting it at a later time, to be able to even watch it to the end). To offer up this type of slow been build up, I think the general audience expects a grand payoff in the end...something to make it worth our while for watching this poor guy be torchered by his boss, coworkers, and even close friends and his own wife and family he's trying so hard to protect, right? Well, if barely two minutes of a very anticlimactic ""ah ha"" moment, with literally two shots of what the entire film his been building up to (with absolutely no resolution, or payoff with ANY other character) then maybe this movie won't leave you as annoyed as it left me.

Is he going crazy or is there something more going on?  Is he schizophrenic or is he genuinely observing clairvoyant psychic foretelling abilities?

It's not exactly a ""horror"" film either. More of a psychological thriller, and not really a post-apocalyptic movie, as I have seen others mention. There is an element of that in there, but mostly we see a man's slow descent into mental illness. It's beautiful and heartbreaking. I highly recommend it.",1490572800,,565,4.835051546391752

I really enjoy Michael's emoting -- quite a tour de force.  But after going along with all the film psychic costs, I want a whole lot more ending -- like 30 minutes.  I didn't read the reviews except to scan -- probably someone's post would have warned me that this film is about mental health issues with a tacked on ending.  Low budget too.

4989801,5,B006HGXGWU,"When I first watched Take Shelter on cable I was honestly blown away by Shannon's powerhouse performance. The film is tense and slow burning, building to a terrifying conclusion rather than sucker punch the audience it to believing it was all in his head. Shannon plays an everyday guy who suddenly faced with something out of the ordinary as apocalyptic nightmares begin to increase in intensity, bringing the mundane world of Shannon's character into a surreal dream-world. I was hooked after the first viewing and even more so when the director didn't opt for a candy coated Hollywood ending, but a truly Hitchcockian ending that is still one of my favorite moments because of questions left unanswered.

I've watched this film every time it's on and every time I find something new within this films puzzling layers, such as clues to the characters fates and even the metaphor of the shelter as a story device. I can't help but realize how deep this film truly is, as films like these have the potential to completely fall apart near the end because of some lame twist or some bad direction or a lame boo scare after it's done. The story itself is quite complex as Curtis' life spirals out of control, so does the intensity of the dreams, spurring on more and more a quiet descent into madness. What makes this film great is its subtley in the story telling and the care that went into not spiraling into slasher territory, but quietly rolling in like a storm and unleashing its wrath. Even Shannon himself admitted to knowing nothing about mental illness before taking the role as he believed that Curtis is a man that wouldn't be well versed in whats happening.

If you love puzzles, this movie will be right up your alley. If you are looking for action, well there's always Twister.",1482019200,3,1789,4.712460063897764

Took me a few movies in to realize this was the same guy from Iceman and Superman. His presence onscreen just sucks you into all his characters. He literally steals every scene he is in. ""There is a STOOORM' C'MING!"". .. I reached that scene about 3 times. Probably one of the best actors of our generation and not many people even know who he is, which is probably a testament to how good he is. He is like the Steven Spielberg of actors.

4989822,3,B006HGXGWU,"The film starts simply. A midwest blue collar worker has frightening dreams of a storm. We know that we're either in a supernatural thriller and the dream content is real, or we're in a real life drama and he's having a psychotic break. The film commits fully to the latter, and we get a detailed picture of someone who is descending into mental illness. The supernatural story is left for dead. Then, in the last minute of the film, the storm dream is suddenly validated, pulling the rug out from under every thing that went before and raising all kinds of unanswerable questions. The best interpretation of the ending is that it is a metaphoric expression of the trauma that the family now has to endure. But there is little in the scene to support this, other than an expression of acceptance on the father's face. On the contrary, the filmmaker tips the interpretation the other way. The father is carefree, building a sand castle, when his child sights the storm. If the child had sensed the onset of dad's delusion, we would have been in the mental illness story, but the way the scene plays out we're forced back into the supernatural thriller. Scanning the comments on the film, viewers are evenly divided between those who would like to think the ending reinforces the reality of the mental break or those who think it vindicates a supernatural reality. And of those who dislike the movie, the majority are ticked off by the ending. For good reason. Make up your mind, Jeff. You can't have it both ways.",1477353600,,1512,4.645522388059701

I agree with another reviewer that this movie was excruciating slow. In fact, my review here was first written as a comment to his review.  But then I thought I should post it as its own review (my own review)...

I watched this movie thinking it was an apocalypse film.  I kept wanting to see a resolution come about. Whether that was the movie's fault or just my impatience because I was looking for action,  I'm not sure. I do think overall the movie is well-made.

At first I REALLY disliked the ending. I thought it meant that he was right all along and I felt heartbroken for this little family that had a chance at survival but then were hundreds of miles away from safety when the storm finally hits. But that's because I began watching the movie thinking it was an apocalypse movie--which it was advertised as.

Only after reading other reviews and mulling the ending over in my mind, have I come to fully understand its symbolism. And honestly I find it rather simplistic once I view it from the angle of a movie about mental illness. (Although one could argue it was an 'apocalyptic' story from the man's point of view because with the onset of mental illness his whole world pretty much ended.)

I see it clearly now, that the storm represents his mental illness. At the beginning of the movie I was frustrated with him for not opening up to his wife about his dreams. But he was trying to protect her--and especially his daughter--from the storm (his mental illness). Building the storm shelter is symbolic of his attempts to protect his family from what was looming.

When he opens the storm shelter doors to come out with his family after the very real storm, he is basically opening up and exposing his family to his mental illness. He is accepting that he can no longer 'shelter' them.

The storm at the end isn't real--it's completely symbolic of his family accepting HIS storm, meaning his mental illness. They are now, all of them, fully exposed to the storm of mental illness the father has.

Overall, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more had I not thought it was about an apocalypse, which gave me a false set of expectations and added to the confusion I experienced throughout and especially at the end.

Also, I just have to add: Why is this rated R??? There are PG-13 movies that are much more violent, graphic, sexual, etc. than this flick. The only thing I can think of is there are a few F-bombs and some violence, but nothing like what's in many PG-13s. I totally do not get the rating for this movie.",1470700800,,2567,4.544468546637744

Curtis (played by Michael Shannon) keeps seeing flocks of birds, storm clouds, yellow rain, and swaying trees. Is a storm really on the horizon, or are they obvious metaphors for delusions signaling the onset of schizophrenia? Curtis soon becomes obsessed with building an elaborate shelter to protect himself and his family. He starts to feel threatened by those closest to him. He takes out a risky loan, betrays his friend, steals and/or borrows company equipment, gets himself fired, becomes violent at a community dinner (great scene) and, finally, he all but ruins his life. Is he mentally ill or can he predict the future? Will he save the lives of his family or commit violence against them? I was hoping for a more unambiguous ending.

I also agree that this movie may not be for everyone. My dad, for instance, I am sure would not have made it beyond the fifteen minute mark. For if a movie doesn't begin with a car chase, a sex scene, or gunfire, his attention goes into sleep mode.

As for me, this movie activated so many inner storms! There was the cyclone of love and what it means to stick together, no matter what. The cyclone of the very fine veil between what is real and what is illusion. The cyclone of social conditioning and the pressure to align with the social web that surrounds us.

The beauty of this movie is its mystery. Its as if as the viewer, the hand of reason (mind) is gradually released and the one of family bond and love (heart) tightened and led forth. You start to feel for everyone involved. For the wife, who is doing her best. For the little daughter who is so cute that you cannot help but love her, and for the husband who wants nothing more than to protect that family that he loves so much.

Throughout the course, you are met with darkening clouds and lightning. Just as you don't know the severity of the storm that may be coming, you are never sure if the husband is experiencing the onset of mental illness or not. You don't know if what you are bracing for is real or not. You don't know if the beautiful family will stay in tact or be blown apart by the storms of the mind and heart.

It all leads to a very powerful point. A message the spiritual teachers and awakened beings have been pointing at from time immemorial. It has to do with the human condition and whether it has or ever had control.

This movie is cinematic poetry. I definitely appreciated my life, and those in it, so much more after watching it.

Both dealt with the ""is it real?"" phenomenon in regards to the experiences of the main characters.  Both included a helpless child in the middle of the mayhem.

In the case of ""Rapture"" we are witnessing the fine line (if a line at all) between religious zeal and insanity, visions versus prophesy, and reality versus hallucination.  In ""Shelter"" the line is between a father's hyper-concern for his family's safety versus paranoid mental illness.  Both movies leave us still wondering if our characters were right all along or simply mad.

In a bigger picture sense, these movies make you think how many survivalist types and religious zealots among us are really insane.  Or, conversely, we might wonder how many people, judged insane by the medical system, could really be prophets or psychics with abilities still beyond society's acceptance.",1466121600,8,981,5.151898734177215

**Small spoiler here:  I feel the end was definitely left to interpretation, and I interpreted it as another dream sequence, however, this time Curtis was coming to terms with the storm (his illness) and realizing the strong support of his family.

4989915,5,B006HGXGWU,"No, despite the claim of other reviewers,  he is not ""disturbed,"" any more than Richard Dreyfus was disturbed in Close Encounters. He is ""disturbed"" if you presume he's hallucinating..  We are privy to what he sees, as is his young daughter, but we are not just sharing his hallucinations. Nickols' challenge is whether we have the strength of our convictions, like Curtis, in the face of a consensus that says we're hallucinating. Will we say, ""Well, I saw it, but since no one else saw it, my reality has been voted down, so I didn't see it."" Is reality contingent on consensus? That's what Nickols is asking here. By the way, delusion and hallucination are often conflated. Delusion is logic based on a fantasy. I'm behaving quite rationally if it's true that the FBI has implanted an RF chip in my cranium. Hallucination is a sensory mistake. I'm confusing my dream state with my waking state, or I'm seeing Banquo at the dinner table. I think Nickols means us to know, in the end, that Curtis is not nuts.

I agree that this is a masterpiece, and that 4 stars is woefully short.  One could bookend this movie with Jeff Nichols' latest, Midnight Special. See both and you'll understand why.",1460764800,17,1194,4.671428571428572

4989937,5,B006HGXGWU,"For the first half of ""Take Shelter"" I thought Curtis's struggles were lame: Why doesn't he fight back, challenge the messages of his dreams rather than accept them as true?

His dog bites him in a dream -- Curtis cages the dog.  His friend fights him in a dream -- Curtis dumps the friend.  His acts are not free acts but are passive --  fear-driven reactions.

I set the film aside, then a week later wanted to finish it.  I had been weighing it against the conventions of a typical movie, instead of experiencing it evocatively, as itself somewhat of a dream.

From the beginning, the movie drums home the idea that his wife Samantha is the key to any hope for Curtis:  I wanted to scream at Curtis as he over and over again rejects her advances and efforts to be part of his life and share in his struggles.

When Curtis has a ominous dream about Samantha and a knife, a turning point is reached. Will Curtis leave her or kick her out, repeating, simplistically, his passive reactive pattern to his other dreams?  Samantha knows enough and sees enough -- based on the little he has told her -- to ask him this question directly.  (Warning: you may want to experience the movie for yourself before reading further.)

Samantha is the real hero of this movie. Her question breaks Curtis's self-destructive compulsive pattern, however temporarily. He experiences her love, a potential bridge to sanity and hope as she clearly outlines to him a plan for building a strong future out of the chaos and disaster that threatens their ""normal"" lives.  She embodies hope, love, optimism, strength, efficacy. We don't doubt her determination or ability, only Curtis's.

She encourages him to move out into normal society again -- the lodge picnic -- and when he acts out publicly with shouting and apparent craziness, she publicly holds him and stands with him.  Such behavior is traditionally expected of any good women so it could go unnoticed, but it's not ordinary but profoundly wise (exactly right), courageous and salvific.

Samantha is solidly sane but goes into the world of a crazy person, with trepidation, feeling her way in the dark unknown toward helping her husband find a way through the storm. She enters the shelter with its locks and allows herself and her child to face the vulnerability and unknowns of a crazy mind. This movie could not have the same message if Curtis were alone.  The bridge between sanity and insanity would not be there.

As her strength and sanity get through to Curtis, he against his wishes and fears opens the shelter door to find bright sunlight and the typical clean-up efforts of resourceful people after a typical storm.  Optimism increases as Curtis, accompanied by his wife, realizes the need to get the best help he can from a psychiatrist in Columbus, the nearest large city.

A viewer should not understand this final meeting with a ""real"" psychiatrist as primarily a comment on the terror and precariousness of life in the the desert of mid-west towns -- as one New York Times writer did. This is a distancing from the more inclusive message of the film: all life is so.  Whether in city or small town, the same kind of obstacles to getting help will present in an ordinary life. Bureaucracy, unpredictable schedules, unsuitable personality or little experience are par for the course of a hero, even if  wealthy,

The sophisticated worldly-wise psychiatrist in Columbus holds out hope again -- just as other characters had earlier in the film: This time a vacation away from the storms of the mid-west, to the bright beaches of North Carolina, leaving the shelter behind.

The end of the film was disappointing to me, although haunting and perhaps inevitable -- a full circle back to the looming threats of Nature at the beginning. The film maker's view would seem to be dark and despairing, perhaps a throw back to the literary movement of Naturalism:  larger forces control us, all is determined, there is really no free will and no escape from a closed world of cause and effect to our eventual doom.  In such a powerless closed world Curtis inherits his mother's genes and his wife and child will be dragged down with him inevitably.

Yet even in an effort to imply such a dark despairing thing about the future the film-maker in spite of himself must leave a door open, after all it is the future, hence OPEN not closed.

Curtis and Hannah their deaf child build a sand castle on the beach (perfect symbol of weakness). A frightening stormy sky suddenly appears out of nowhere. The film ends with Samantha -- Samantha walking toward the storm as her hair begins to gently blow, as if knowing she cannot escape. She seems to be entranced, realizing something for herself this time.  Is she too going crazy?  Is this the final apocalypse that the shelter combined with stormy Nature seems to imply for many viewers?

We can however believe otherwise and be true to the movie.  Yes, Samantha is being faced with her utter weakness as a human being, but she is not running to shelter.  She faces the storm full on.  And she is, no matter her deepening awareness of powerful unknown forces, still Samantha and will do her best against all odds.",1453939200,4,5193,4.726970033296338

4989959,5,B006HGXGWU,"When a film has all sorts of film festival laurels on its cover I immediately get a bit suspicious.  But in the case of Take Shelter, the plaudits don't come from some fly-by-night film festival but rather Sundance and Cannesthe cream of the crop.  This isn't an easy film to classify.  Its not a traditional horror film although it has its horrific elements.  Certainly it is party psychological suspense and drama.  Its difficulty in categorizing is one of the things that makes it so unique.

Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a blue-color crew leader for a construction company, living with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and deaf daughter Hannah.  He begins experiencing troubling dreams and hallucinations of an impending apocalyptic storm as well as his being harmed by people he is close to.  He wakes up sweating and gasping for air as the dreams become more terrifying.  They begin to affect his performance at work and his relationship with his family.  Curtis mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was in her mid-30s and Curtis fears he is heading down the same path.

He becomes obsessed with building an underground storm shelter, even as he becomes the object of derision in his small-town community.  But is Curtis truly going insane?  Is a he precognitive?  Or is a higher power sending him these visions?  These questions are what gift-wraps Take Shelter into a thoroughly engrossing film.  Director Jeff Nichols builds the tension with a powerful yet subtle hand.  Curtis seeks help from a counselor for his troubles so he is aware and deeply concerned that he will end up institutionalized like his mother.  Yet even though he is aware of his problem, that does not curb his obsession to work on his shelter, day and night, even at the cost of his job.

Michael Shannon gives an incredibly deep and thoughtful performance worthy of an Oscar nomination has this film been more well known.  We can identify with him because he is like most of us, just an honest, hard-working guy trying to provide a good life for his family when fate intervenes and throws his life out of whack.  Jessica Chastain, who was recently nominated for both an Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance in The Help, provides a solid co-star as the strong, supportive wife.  Take Shelter is one of those small films that absolutely deserves to find a bigger audience.",1438387200,2,2373,4.850746268656716

4989977,2,B006HGXGWU,"Great acting, cinematography and special effects, but a story that's so stupid it ruins it all. What a waste of talent, technology and money.

A steady, plodding descent into insanity, with what must be the dumbest ending in the history of the movies tacked on out of nowhere. Sloppy direction doesn't help, with stupid, avoidable goofs like vehicles parked where nobody would park them; a Midwestern small-town library open on a Sunday morning; a large, energetic male dog who has never been confined but stays inside a tiny fence so flimsy a rabbit could knock it down; and other trivial mistakes happen so often that they become a serious distraction.

One huge mistake that's not trivial at all is the unbelievable married couple at the center of this movie. It's absurd that a lovely, intelligent, emotionally balanced woman like Samantha ever looked twice at a surly, egocentric nut like Curtis, much less married him.

Unlike similar movies in which the protagonist does alarming things no one else can understand, like Close Encounters, Curtis is never shown here as a normal person, as a character we get to know a little bit and therefore care about. From the very beginning, he's sullen and introverted, completely closed down emotionally and inaccessible not only to his wife and child but to us. Of course a person so profoundly crippled is going to fall apart, but he's so remote and unappealing that it's hard to care.

So the overriding question in this suspense thriller is not ""What is really happening?"" or ""How will this end?"" but ""Why should we care?"" I didn't. Despite very strong acting and visuals, Take Shelter is tedious and unbelievable for almost two hours, and then infuriating at the end.",1424736000,3,1718,4.913793103448276

4989987,5,B006HGXGWU,"Take Shelter is a film of searing power. Without blinking, the story drives forward with gripping intensity and a lingering sense of dread, uncertainty and fear that our world teeters on the edge of catastrophe.

The skies are trying to warn Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon). At least thats what he thinks when he begins having strange dreams about apocalyptic thunderstorms of oily, brown rain and menacing lightening that seems to be alive. Curtis lives in the Ohio countryside with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and his hearing-impaired daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart). They are a happy family until Curtis starts having his dreams.

There is a tornado shelter in Curtis backyard. When the dreams turn into more vivid hallucinations, Curtis realizes that being awake is no longer an escape from his deepest fears. He hears thunder and lightening that is not there. He sees flocks of birds flying in bizarre and unnatural patterns. He fears his best friend (Shea Whigam), his wife and even himself.

He decides to take action against whatever is coming by expanding the shelter and preparing it for the worst. In doing so, he exceeds his financial limits, putting at risk his job, his familys health insurance and his marriage.

Curtis also realizes that his visions perhaps are the result of an unstable mind. He goes to the library to research schizophrenia, and later visits his mother (Kathy Baker), who has a history of mental illness, to ask if she ever had strange dreams. He struggles to come to terms with his increasingly violent visions, and to figure out how he can save himself and his family from whatever might be coming.

Take Shelter is the second film by writer/director Jeff Nichols, and it is a tour de force that showcases the young filmmakers masterful ability to fill the screen with such tense, powerful images, while keeping the special effects subtle and to a bare minimum. Such restraint is tremendous in todays filmmaking world, and it proves that Nichols is the real deal.

Assisting Nichols in his efforts is the truly transcendent Michael Shannon. Shannon is an actor who is, to my knowledge, unrivaled at what he is able to do on screen. He is a performer of such unrelenting power and off-kilter sincerity that it is easy to wish he had a part in every movie made.
Shannon brings a surprising but necessary restraint to Curtis LaForche. Like in all of his previous roles, the actor commits to the performance almost frighteningly well.

But unlike in William Friedkins melodramatic masterpiece Bug and Sam Mendes Revolutionary Road, Shannon keeps his energy bubbling beneath the surface, allowing it to rise up only once, in a crucial scene of frantic frustration and desperation.

Curtis wife is a role that could have easily been a space-filler. Luckily, Jessica Chastain takes charge of the role and makes it far more than that. Chastain rises to Shannons level and establishes herself as a very important actress. As Samantha, she gives such weight to Curtis decisions that it deepens the overall sincerity and effectiveness of the film. Her work here gives the film another dimension.

Take Shelter is a visually captivating experience thanks to the beautiful and sometimes startling work done by Nichols and his cinematographer Adam Stone. The skies have never looked so naturally full of malice.

The same goes for the chilling score by composer David Wingo.

The elements all come together in Take Shelter, easily making it the best film of 2011.",1418342400,2,3499,4.994845360824742

People get too caught up on the ending, all I can say is stop taking what you see literally. The ending, as with the whole movie, is allegorical.

4990007,4,B006HGXGWU,"This is a very good film that is enhanced by knowing as little as possible about it. You may wish to read no further.

Curtis (Michael Shannon) lives in Ohio with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and deaf daughter Hannah. He works in construction, and Samantha makes ends meet by doing ironing and selling her embroidery at the local market. Hannah needs corrective surgery, and they're lucky enough that Curtis's health insurance will cover this. Curtis starts having dreams of lightning storms and tornadoes. In the dreams, birds swoop and swarm and fall from the sky, and friends and loved ones turn against him. He starts to have trouble telling dreams from reality. He consults medical textbooks, mindful of his own family history of mental illness, and wonders if he should see a psychiatrist. Curtis starts to pour his scant resources into reinforcing his tornado shelter, and his behaviour becomes too erratic for his employer or his small community to ignore.

At first glance, this film seemed to fall into the genre of, ""Is he crazy, or is he so sane it will BLOW YOUR MIND?"" Usually, such films show their hand early, all the better to sympathise with the protagonist, who the audience knows is the only one in possession of the truth. Take Shelter maintains its ambiguity until the last 15 minutes. It embraces the implication that some of these stories must be about a descent into mental illness, and makes it clear that, even if Curtis is somehow right, he's burned an awful lot of bridges.

Curtis's dreams are also scary as hell, when they move from the storms (spooky enough in themselves in the tornado-prone midwest) to lurking figures, abduction, and an effects sequence that's all the more breathtaking in the middle of a film that otherwise maintains an unexpectedly matter-of-fact tone.

Take Shelter manages to point out the inequity and exclusivity of the American health system without belabouring the point. It also fits into an expanding genre of environmental catastrophe films, which must say something about the zeitgeist.

Michael Shannon (stolid in Boardwalk Empire, electric in The Runaways, shouty as General Zod) is excellent throughout, conveying Curtis's torment through a largely internalised performance, against which his larger displays of emotion appear wholly in character rather than being an actor's showpiece. Jessica Chastain is splendid once again, and makes all of Samantha's reactions entirely consistent with what would a smart, concerned, loyal wife and mother might do in response to her husband's apparently baseless obsession.

Absorbing, frightening and moving, Take Shelter is worth tracking down.",1402185600,,2661,5.191142191142191

The movie made me think a lot about  the question of what is prophecy and what is insanity.  Michael Shannon's character's  transition from normal family guy to tortured soul driven to increasingly bizarre behavior is very effectively portrayed. His wife, beautifully played by Jessica Chastain, is trying valiantly to stand on what is increasingly unsteady ground created by her husbands growing obsession with a coming cataclysm.

But what if Ray was waiting not for the arrival of a mysterious man but rather of a mysterious storm? What if he began pouring his limited resources into a storm shelter? What if the Hollywood ending was replaced by the growing suspicion that Ray had schizophrenia? If you made those changes (and a few more, including the shift from Iowa to Ohio) youd have Take Shelter.

Take Shelter, a film written and directed by Jeff Nichols,  won the grand jury prize at Cannes in 2011. Ever since Ive been waiting for it to receive the wide distribution it so deserved. Alas, it never did. And so I had to wait for pay-per-view.

It was worth the wait. In a world dominated by cinematic dreck like Transformers, here is a film with a burning intensity, a sense of stifling existential dread I haven't seen since Kubricks immortal The Shining, and one of the most haunting dream sequences since like, ever (though a couple of the sequences in Stir of Echoes come mighty close). To top it off, the film has the boldness to introduce an ambiguity at the end to rival Bill Paxtons serial killer in Frailty.

If you build it, he will come. So went the comforting refrain of Field of Dreams. Here the message is quite different: build it, because it is coming. Never has the line between insanity and prophecy been so blurred.

Michael Shannon doesn't miss a beat as a midwestern Everyman within whom all hell is about to break loose. As it does, his fear is palpable. He also masters the resolute surety of the delusional. If you have empathy and insight into the experience of the type of nameless, formless panic that grips Curtis, imagine the courage it took to open that cellar door. Jessica Chastain is both sweet and strong as his wife. She is subject to true fear of her husband and what is happening (Again, imagine yourself in that cellar with your child, hoping but with no sense of certainty that Curtis is indeed going to let them out). Yet she stands by him after everything and her love is luminous.

The cinematography and lighting and sound effects add so much to Take Shelter that they are almost characters in themselves. The plot and dialogue flow smoothly. Add in relevant commentary on managed care and the realities of the medical system, life without insurance coverage, and the barriers to seeking quality mental health care, and you have one hell of a movie.

I'm not going to talk about the ending. The debate and discussion of it will add to your experience of this film if you are interested in such things.  I'll close with the caveat that If you can't tolerate ambiguity or get down with metaphors you will find Take Shelter frustrating.

Each one intensifies, leading Curtis (Michael Shannon) to greater and greater depths as he copes with these premonitions. His actions take a tole on his family, his friends, and himself. We are treated to wonderful journey that explores just how far Curtis is willing to go to protect his family.

Don't be fooled: Michael Shannon is the star, but his supporting company is just as terrific, including Jessica Chastain & Shea Wigham.

Other reviews will offer a more detailed synopsis or a thorough analysis of the mental illness portrayed in the film.

I just say don't get bogged down by the details and allegory too much. (There'll be plenty of time for that after the movie, as it doesn't easily leave your own mind.)

4990043,4,B006HGXGWU,"Is Curtis having the hallucinations of a mentally ill person or is he prophetic when he imagines apocalyptic weather patterns and bizarre behavior around him? After several disturbing nightmares and hallucinations about severe weather, Curtis, who lives in a suburban area and works at a blue collar job, decides to renovate his storm shelter. But even while doing this, he doubts his own sanity (his mother was institutionalized for schizophrenia many years ago), and visits a counselor. His wife and brother and co-workers become very concerned about him, but he can't be dissuaded.

The plot moves along at a slow pace with some intense emotional scenes well acted by Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife. A sense of doom pervades the plot, as you fear that Curtis' irrational actions are going to spiral into madness and ruin his family life and marriage. And he can't seem to stop it. After he builds the storm shelter, there is a storm warning and they spend the night in the shelter, but it's not a major storm. The family eventually takes their summer vacation at a beach house at the urging of a psychiatrist that Curtis visits, and all seems normal until the final scenes of the movie. A menacing storm arrives and the movie ends... everything unresolved, leaving you to make up your own ending. I liked the movie well enough right up until the ending, but then I couldn't figure out what I thought about it....

He builds a storm shelter as a precautionary measure while trying to hide his visions. But, is it all in his head or is the apocalypse coming? Take Shelter is an immersive and entertaining psychological drama.

I really enjoyed the story in Take Shelter. The story plays like a psychological drama where Curtis continues to question his sanity, and so does the rest of the town. His visions, both conscious and unconscious, are vivid and realistic adding a pinch of mystery and suspense; it may not end the way you expect it. On that note, the end is magnificent (whether you look at it literally or metaphorically), especially the accompanying music. It's heavily supported by Michael Shannon's superb performance, as well as the all-around magnificent supporting cast. It's tightly directed and written by Jeff Nichols. The cinematography is exceptional at times. The music blends seamlessly with the film and adds to the immersion.

The blu-ray of the film is of truly superb quality. The picture and audio quality are exceptional, and the special features are worth your time. Definitely a great blu-ray to add to your collection, and clearly the definitive version of the film.

Overall, Take Shelter is an amazing drama blending psychological, suspense, and mystery elements to create an immersive film; an addicting film you'll want to watch again. I highly recommend a purchase.

4990067,4,B006HGXGWU,"As others have noted, TAKE SHELTER is rather slow-moving and will probably prove too uneventful for those wanting fast action and such. The plot, however, moves at a very natural pace, and I know of few films that do such a fine job of portraying ordinary Middle American people. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (of ZERO DARK THIRTY fame) are outstanding in their roles as such people, as are most of the rest of the cast.

TAKE SHELTER affords its audience a great deal of empathy with someone suffering from schizophrenia and is very revealing of the impact it can have on every aspect of that person's life. The ending is a bit hard to interpret, and the director declines to offer any explanation during his Special Features Commentary. The way I see it, it has something to do with the frequent question of ""Who's really to say what's real and what's hallucination?""",1372809600,2,876,4.7254901960784315

If in the real world you have within a growing sense that things are just off and that something big is certain to change your, our, lives forever, and soon, and that it's best to quietly prepare, then this film speaks to that quiet sense of self-preservation. It seems many folks have lost that ability to trust themselves and their intuitions; accordingly, this film navigates that boundary between needing to feel normal in the face of overwhelming instinctual dread and wanting to save face. I can't describe it any better because it (the film's thesis) spoke to me in indescribable ways. It will mean something different to different people. It's worth seeing once for the strong character acting, but to watch it again would spoil the effect.",1372723200,2,836,4.9361702127659575
4990070,5,B006HGXGWU,"While this superb film came & went without much commercial success, I have no doubt that it'll come to be regarded as a seminal film for this era, which is so permeated with formless fear & dread. The film captures all of that fear & dread in countless aspects: apocalyptic fears, terrorism, insanity, economic collapse, disintegration of the family, drastic climate change, the end of civilization as we know it. Yes, it's about all those things ... and yet it's never ponderous, impressed with its own weight or importance. It's essentially a simple, straightforward story of one man, struggling to hold his life & soul together as nightmarish dreams & visions of doom convince him that he's slipping into the same abyss of mental illness that took his mother.

Curtis (a magnificently understated but intense Michael Shannon) is a deeply loving husband & father, working a job that keeps him just a paycheck away from consuming debt. His wife (the glowing Jessica Chastain) sells handmade goods to supplement their income, they have a deaf daughter who needs an expensive operation. Living in tornado country, they're already under threat from the weather, as well as walking a precarious economic tightrope. Curtis is also troubled by the fact that his father ran out on his family when he was young, which makes him all the more determined & desperate to be a good father & husband. But in these times, that's harder & harder for so many working men. In fact, he's lucky to have a job at all, and he knows it.

But then he starts having terrible dreams about a strange oily rain, mysterious storms & flocks of birds. In these dreams, loved ones become vicious killers who attack him: his family dog, his best friend, even his beloved wife. And he hears thunder while awake, thunder that nobody else seems to hear. He's approaching the same age his mother was when she developed schizophrenia, and of course he fears that he's inherited whatever genetic flaw it was that destroyed her mind. But by his very nature, desiring to be strong & self-sufficient, he's slow to tell anyone, preferring to check out books on mental illness from his woefully insufficient local library. His doctor recommends an analyst, but Curtis can't afford that; he agrees to see a local counselor, who is caring but clearly overworked & unprepared to cope with his potential problem.

Soon he becomes obsessed with repairing & extending the old tornado storm shelter on his property, obviously the way a man who works with his hands tries to retain control of his life, by building something. Yet the dreams are getting worse, and that's starting to affect both his working & home life. Friends & family notice, become uneasy, worried -- all of which makes him even more frightened of what might be happening to him.

Finally the crisis comes. What this is, I won't reveal ... but there's more than one crisis here, leading to an ambiguous ending that could be literal, metaphoric, or both. It'll generate a lot of discussion as to its nature. I'll only say that it had to be ambiguous, and doesn't yield to just one ""correct"" explanation. If it has any cinematic antecedent, it would be Peter Weir's 1977 classic ""The Last Wave"" -- very similar in story, but headed in a very different direction, because it deals with very different cultural material.

Meanwhile, if you want an emotionally gripping, thought-provoking film that deals with existential dread in contemporary America, putting fantasies of zombies & sci-fi apocalypse to shame as the childish detritus they are, then this is it. There's no escapist nonsense of Stuff Blowed Up Real Good -- what blows up here is the illusion of security & normality we all need to get through everyday life in increasingly uncertain times.

4990082,2,B006HGXGWU,"Take Shelter is about a small town Ohio man who strongly believes something bad is going to happen to him.  He spends all his time hallucinating the most horrific events will occur at any given moment such as tornadoes heading for his home, birds circling in the sky indicating impending doom, loud crashes of thunder and lightning that only he can hear but not his workmates, strangers standing in the rain outside his home preparing to break in, furniture unexplainably lifting from his living room floor, etc.  The problem is... I just named all the good moments.  Besides this, the rest of the movie is extremely tedious to watch due to being incredibly boring.

Even his wife is a typical midtown-type lady who really serves no purpose as far as storyline development goes- she's only there so we can have more characters besides a hallucinating freak of a husband/father.  I seriously don't even think those who suffer from worrying constantly about potential serious danger would find Take Shelter interesting either- it does nothing to help people who suffer from these conditions.  It's too bland to really accomplish anything for *any* type of movie watcher.  I also seriously question whether Ohio's lands are as flat as portrayed in this movie, allowing tornadoes to be more frequent.  Maybe portions of the western half of the state.

The man spends all his time either building his meaningless shelter in the back yard (without his wifes consent, heh) or talking to psychiatrists/taking medication for his lack of sleep/hallucinations.  I seriously can't remember a movie that felt so uninspiring and worthless to watch.  Over two *hours* of this stuff, too.  I feel like a total fool for watching it.  I feel foolish for believing the movie description was suspenseful and focused on tornadoes or a heavy atmosphere pertaining to storm activity- not really.  Oh and was the ending supposed to justify the 2 hours of boredom we had to persevere?  Give me a break.

Michael Shannon's character spends most of the movie with the ""deer caught in the headlights"" look after having several ""prophetic"" type dreams about a storm and several other terrifying events.  His bizarre behavior is forgivable under the circumstances but it takes nearly the entire movie before he can share his dreams with his family who has now gone through numerous ordeals because of him and his torment. But the worst is the end.  A bad storm finally comes and the he and his family spend the night in the storm shelter that he built at the cost of his home and his job.  However, the next morning arrives and after a strong bit of encouragement from his wife he opens the door only to find the storm did little damage at all.  Shannon's character then heads the advice of a doctor and leaves town for a while to unwind. The final scene has the family at a beach in South Carolina having a nice time when they all notice a terrible storm coming off the ocean.  The movie then ends abruptly.

It gives you the sense of impending doom that come from economic crises, climate change,the loss of our formerly secure way of life,the storm that is prophesied to come, It's about the loss of everything that matters to middle class Americans: their jobs, their homes, their friends, their families, their sanity. Curtis,is a man whose dreams tell him what is happening,they auger a disaster about to happen. He is slowly going mad,there's evidence he has inherited his mother's mental illness,paranoid schizophrenia. He has delusions and hallucinations of end-of-days rain,tornados,strange clouds of birds,assaults,abductions,flying furniture.""Is anyone seeing this?""he asks stopping on the side of the road before a huge electrical storm. The question resonates with the crises of money and morale today.

He can't communicate with his wife. He is fearful and protective of his deaf daughter. He is an upper blue-collar working man who works in gravel. He's practical,taciturn,withdrawn,strong yet vulnerable. Family and its protection is everything. Survival. The portents of stormy apocalypse are the projections of an unsettled mind. From the outside his friend Dewar says:"" You got it good"".But the film views Curtis from inside-dismantling his home,banishing the dog,alienating friends,taking out a high risk loan to extend the family's storm shelter,abusing his job and sacked for misconduct. It's only after an overdose and a seizure that he tells his wife about the dreams. When a minor storm hits, the town's air raid sirens go off and the family wisely flees to the storm shelter. Inside the bunker, when the storm has passed,Samantha forces Curtis first to take off his gas mask and then open the shelter himself. I think Samantha telling Curtis, ""We love you very much,"" followed by Curtis opening the shelter and being confronted by the open, non-stormy sky is very powerful and very telling. Curtis thinks the storm is still raging, but once he opens it, he's forced to confront reality.

The whole film is a metaphor,including the ending still being in the dream,only his family through empathy are included in its disclosure. The performances are superb,with Shannon's diffident,furrow-browed,tight-wound, freighted with dread-enigmatic,sympathetic and infuriating. Jessica Chastain portrayal has warmth,strength, vulnerability,conveying the horror of watching her husband's deterioration,the possible destruction of theirlives, yet tries to understand to help her life partner. Curtis rages at friends and neighbours at a supper about their ill-preparedness for the coming storm. Baldly shot on DV with some crisply stylised visual effects. It deals with ordinary life under pressure,with the realities as well as the surrealities of the world. The methodical,paced inevitability of a slow-burn film giving a distress signal from a civilization gone awry. A modern Noah for our out-of -joint times.

He sees a psychiatrist, visits his schizophrenic mother, and researches and builds a storm shelter just in case the dreams turn out to be real.

His wife gets frustrated with the obsession with the storm shelter as she is trying to get hearing implants for the couple's deaf daughter.

If not, you may be disappointed.

4990095,5,B006HGXGWU,"What is real?  What gives us nightmares?  Michael Shannon as Curtis LaForche gives a remarkable performance as a man who is grappling with reality.  His mother, played by Kathy Baker, deserted her young family only to be found a week later rummaging through dumpsters for a meal.  Committed to insane asylum as a paranoid schizophrenic Curtis and his devoted wife Samantha, Jessica Chastain, are terrified he is going down the same road.  The filament that divides mental health vs mental breakdown becomes increasingly fragile.  Or could Curtis be sane?  Surely not, he is wetting the bed, acting increasingly erratic at home and work while making scenes in public.  Shannon had me on the edge of my seat and Chastain made a very convincing loving but exasperated wife.  The twists and turns made me gasp and the ending was the biggest surprise of all.

Great script and direction from Jeff Nichols.  I will be a new follower of his work. Shannon you will recognize if you are a fan of Boardwalk Empire.  Chastain will be on the Red Carpet tomorrow night for a second year in a row.  Oscar's oversight but don't let it be yours.

4990118,5,B006HGXGWU,"Take Shelter is a psychological drama about a man Curtis, and his family. Curtis begins having these awful dreams at night that depict a strong storm that ravages all life seen in the movie. Curtis has to choose between his instinct, and his family. The movie is based upon the great split between following instincts and abandoning instinct for social acceptance. The movie is very slow paced, but it works well to make you feel closer to Curtis, like you understand exactly how he feels. This movie is remarkable on many levels. The screenplay is excellent, it strays as far away from cliches as possible, and boasts an epic, and intense climax that will leave you thinking about our society, and how we sometimes have to abandon instinct to be accepted by others, even loved ones. Critics praise this movie for it's intensity and it's epic feel, but I like this movie because it sends the viewer many messages about many topics that we deal with in our lives. This movie is very well acted, and many were surprised that Michael Shannon (Curtis) won no Oscars or Golden Globes for his performance, despite many very respectable critics such as Roger Ebert saying he deserved an Oscar. He carries this movie on his shoulders and holds it to glory.
Story- 10/10
The story is very intense, and very well written. There are almost no predictable moments, and this movie contains little to no cliches, which together, is an accomplishment for modern film. Very slow moving, and certain scenes seem to drag on, but it doesn't hinder the great screenplay.

Acting- 5/5
The movie is very well acted. Michael Shannon delivers a powerhouse performance better than many of those that win the Oscars every year. Michael Shannon provides a believable, and touching performance that leaves you feeling like you actually knew Curtis. Jessica Chastain co-stars and also does an amazing job with her role as Curtis' wife, and in depicting how someone would act if their significant other was beginning to sound like he/she is crazy to you. The daughter also does an unbelievable job, and there is no doubt that she also contributed to the depth of the acting.

Effects- 5/5
The effects are astounding. Breathtaking even. Most of the effects used were during the dreams that help paint out a huge apocalyptic storm. The effects were used seamlessly without being overused or overdone. Very good use of lighting to set mood as well as an astounding soundtrack that touches the soul, giving it an intense, slightly mysterious, and epic feel to it. All effects of all sorts were used here to the best I have seen in any movie in a while.

Presentation- 4.5/5
Take Shelter is presented beautifully, and perfectly. There is no better way it could have been presented. The acting was phenomenal, the effects were stunning, but not overdone, the cinematography was well done and the writing is a masterpiece. However one small thing takes away a half a point, and that is the pace. The pace is agonizingly slow. It serves it's purpose well, but to some it may be just too slow. To me it is personally not bad, but to someone else it may mean a lot to their opinion of this movie.

Overall- 19.5/20
Take Shelter is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. It has no flaws in my eyes with the exception of pace that will only bother some, not all, which is sadly, the only thing keeping this movie from a perfect score. This movie boasts superb acting, phenomenal effects, brilliant writing and a lot to think about afterwards. I highly recommend this movie to all. It is a low budget, not very well known movie that deserves sooo much more credit for it's accomplishments in film making. In my eyes, this is one of the greatest films ever made, and coming from me, a movie connoisseur to the definition, is saying a lot.

Admittedly, the plot is thin if you stare at it too long. What carries it is the acting. It's all about the acting. If you want to watch really  great acting that catapults a so-so story into a convincing great story this is it. None of the actors are slouches but Michael Shannon really shines in this one.

4990128,5,B006HGXGWU,"One of my favorite films of 2011 was TAKE SHELTER which was written and directed by Jeff Nichols who directed SHOTGUN STORIES which was one of the best movies of 2008. TAKE SHELTER is about a man named Curtis, played by Michael Shannon, who is a hard working husband and father in a small and close knit community in Arkansas. He starts having apocalyptic dreams of devastating storms and becomes obsessed with building a particularly elaborate storm shelter. His behavior soons alienates him from friends, co-workers and ultimately his family. As the audience we are given the choice to believe in his vision or go along with the rest of the community in branding him crazy and/or someone on the verge of a mental breakdown or possibly schizophrenic. The story, for myself, seems to be an allegory of how many people in today's society tend to easily dismiss individuals who have views that make them uncomfortable or uneasy. We tend to be lulled into beliefs that correspond to our most comfortable and least fearful theories and correspond to the beliefs coerced by mass manipulation. This can be quite detrimental to society as a whole when we rely so much on the judgements of groups instead of relying on our own truths. The great thing about this film is that it is one of those films that everyone will have a different take on. I believe that it is one of the director's primary intensions when making this film. It's a movie where if you see it with a group of people there will be great discussions afterwards. I also have to emphazise the incredible acting by everyone but particularly by Michael Shannon. The intensity he brings to his role is brilliant. I am now looking forward to director Jeff Nichols 2012 release called MUD.",1352073600,,1742,4.733552631578948

Spoiler alert: if he had the oily rain on his hand I'd say otherwise but his wife had it so I think it was really happening this time. The end is very sad because with all he went through to prepare and make a shelter he and his little family probably ended up dead because they had no where to ""shelter"". I hate endings that leave you hanging. In my mind they ran and some neighbors who had been watching them and had prepared a shelter because of ""mental warnings"" allowed them in just in the nick of time. Maybe pulling them over the railing of their deck kind of like what happened in the car wreck scene.",1352073600,2,781,4.077922077922078

This movie is basically a study of the onset of paranoid schizophrenia, but it is much more than that. It is a film about acceptance, love, and family support in the face of the most devastating mental illness. The ending has a lot of viewers confused, angry, and frustrated. The negative reviews reflect a lack of understanding of how the mentally ill view the world, and the ending makes total sense to me.

Normally i would've shut this movie off after watching about 30-40 minutes of uninteresting, unentertaining nothingness. But because of the 7.1 IMDb rating and the 80% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, i stuck with the whole movie thinking the entire time that because of those high marks, that this movie has just got to get better eventually. BUT NOPE! It remained thoroughly uninteresting, unentertaining and VERY BORING throughout. The only reason i gave this 2 stars and not 1 star is because of the dialoge and how it was recited. The words they spoke and the way the actors delivered those lines were very realistic. Like the way real people in real life speak and communicate with each other. For me, that was the only good thing about this waste of 2 hours of my life film. To me, this was an utter pointless waste of celluloid. And im not an action movie junkie or anything like that. I don't mind a slow-paced movie as long as it has a good story and a point to it with a satisfying ending. This movie had none of that.

He ""borrows"" earth moving tools from work, uses his friends, borrows money from bank, loses job, seems insane right to the end when the storm he worries about appears.

4990149,5,B006HGXGWU,"but I'll try not to play the spoiler. Suffice it to say, the full meaning of Take Shelter rests perilously upon the final scene, where the primary issue of the film--the sanity of the protagonist--is seemingly resolved. A straight-forward reading of that scene yields a richness of social implication; allegorical or ironic readings yield nothing but the fruit of a well-acted psycho-suspense thriller.

Appearances aside, this is not a film about the private affairs of a married couple, and this is not a film that ends on a note of discontinuity. The whole point of the film is that the line between private anguish and public life is an illusion; the whole point of the ending is that it is the logical outcome of a psychological process that has been building up for two hours on screen.

As far as I'm concerned, Take Shelter is about the challenge of people coming together in the face of an impending political catastrophe, about forging a meeting-of-minds that requires nothing less than extraordinary courage and empathy from all of us, as we strive to overcome the all-but-unbridgeable gaps between our various subjective experiences of the world. In this sense, the super-natural elements in Take Shelter appear only superficially in the sky; the real miracle is in what happens between two human beings--married or unmarried, it makes no difference--by the end of the film.

 In my view, Take Shelter is far and away the most important political film of this young century.",1346889600,2,1486,4.979838709677419

1. He is a sort of prophet/visionary
2. The scene at church where he loses it and flips over a table -- reminiscent of Jesus in the temple with the moneychangers
3. He is rejected and censured for not following local custom/expectations and taking risks
4. He does what he feels rightfully compelled to do although others see him as crazy
5. His descent into a tomb and arising ""from the dead"" into the light

The protagonist imagines, vividly, that there is an apocalyptic storm set to hit his small town - soon. He attempts to communicate this notion to his friends, family, and co-workers; to no avail. They see him as 'worked up,' about 'nothing.'

Have they ever witnessed weather that might threaten their lives? No. Thus, they continue with their daily, mundane routines. While the protagonist mortgages his home to revamp an underground shelter in his backyard...

...to his wife's...horror.

With an entire town - even his family seemingly against him - he begins to doubt his very sanity. Has he inherited the same mental issue that claimed the functional sanity of his mother? He wonders.

Thus, here is the essential conflict, driving this tale:

Can the protagonist trust his vivid imagination, his gut-level feelings, his intuition? Ah yes; he does have a bit of 'physical evidence,' in the form of strange bird formations in the sky, and odd 'sludge' coming down during rainfalls. Yet are these, in addition to his visions, enough, for him to trust himself, over others? Or are those in his life, 'onto something,' when they disregard his bleak vision of future 'weather horror' as speculation at best - madness, at worst?

The answer is revealed in a final sequence that is truly breathtaking, disturbing, beautifully filmed; to state it mildly.

It is among my favorite finales in film history.

The 'subtext,' or underlying theme here?

If you have an intuitive sense that something 'just isn't right' - it may well be best to trust your instincts; rather than the opinion of the 'mass of Man,' which might well dub you, 'mad.'

A great film. Unquestionably.

That this film scores one star is beyond preposterous and is a symptom a much deeper culture clash of idiots and sycophants who need some kind of 'payoff' in a film. Something to tell them that what they watched was so valuable and so worth their time. **** these people man. This film is fabulous. I am in love with the acting and direction in this film. FIRST RATE. I do think on another plane that the ending could have just blacked out with him seeing daylight after opening the doors in the end. That would have incited a riot I am sure in America but could have been another great alternate ending. I am sure they considered it. I think a few foreign films have done similar and also the excellent film Limbo did something like this as well.,1345248000,5,1078,4.315270935960591

Blu Ray was my choice.  The immages of rural Ohio are dramatically beautiful.  The movie extends to two hours long.  It is a deliberate pace.  Yet, when it is over, it feels like a much shorter movie.

Curtis LaForche keeps staring up at the sky.  Whether it's a bank of menacing storm clouds or a flock of birds flying in a strange formation he`s looking at, this Ohio construction worker is developing the unnerving sense that something is just not quite right with the world, and that Doom may be just over the horizon. It doesn't help that he's being plagued by a rash of dreams that seem to be reinforcing that conviction.  Before you know it, he's building an elaborate underground shelter and stocking it with emergency supplies - bankrupting the family and alienating those closest to him in the process.  Throughout, the movie forces us to keep asking the question: is he mentally ill or is there really something to this feeling?  Is he perhaps some modern-day Cassandra, cursed with the awareness of impending disaster but powerless to do anything to prevent it?

Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, ""Take Shelter"" is a horror story told with all the quiet spareness of an apocalyptic parable.  The rural setting works for two seemingly contradictory reasons.  It brings a sense of foreboding to a small-town environment where threats to safety seem few and far between.  Yet, at the same time, the stark flatness of the Midwestern plane can make one feel immensely vulnerable against the powerful forces of nature - be it crackling thunderstorms, destructive tornadoes or just an endless sky filled with towering cloud formations that dwarf anything on the earth`s surface.

What separates ""Taking Shelter"" from so many other films on the subject of mental illness is that Curtis (the stunning Michael Shannon) is not content to suffer in silence, but rather takes proactive steps to figure out what might be wrong with him on a medical level and to search for solutions.  It helps that his mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was in her 30s, and so he figures he may be exhibiting symptoms of the same illness.

The movie also explores the more mundane reality of working-class folk being just one paycheck away from poverty and loss of health care insurance.  That is the REAL doomsday scenario.

On the surface, the film harkens back to those earlier days of atom-bomb scares, then brings it into the present with our current obsession with terrorist attacks.

On a deeper level, it's about the Sword of Damacles - that unspecified object of dread - that dangles over our heads at every moment of our lives but which we choose to ignore as the only possible way of getting through life.  But Curtis, for whatever reason, is being forced to acknowledge its existence and the ever-present threat it poses to him and his family.  Our modern life has become so safety-bound and sanitized that we tend to forget that, through our entire history as a species, we've been confronted with daily threats to survival.  And Curtis seems to have somehow reconnected to that truth.  Yet, paradoxically, we've also become a people who magnify threats beyond their actual magnitude of probability (terrorism being just one example).

The irony is that by focusing so intently on the apocalypse that may or may never come, Curtis is endangering those close to him in far more mundane ways: bankrupting the family, jeopardizing his job, alienating his friends and co-workers, and driving a wedge between himself and his understandably concerned wife (Jessica Chastain) and deaf little daughter (Tova Stewart) with his bizarre and frightening behavior.

Featuring a flawless tour-de-force performance by Shannon, ""Take Shelter"" is a subtle, thoughtful and unnerving film that gets under one's skin - as any fine horror movie should.",1344729600,2,3660,5.016528925619835

4990169,5,B006HGXGWU,"Caution! This movie does not whisk you away. You cannot bully it from start to finish with the rage of a juggernaut on acid. This is not that sort of movie, so you cannot watch it with that mindset. Instead, Take Shelter calls for a different approach. This is the sort of film that you must allow to move you. Let it work its plot slowly, not to torture you, but to build in you the emotions, the powerful tension, the stress that each character feels. And while these things are a long time (~2 hours) forming, the sheer magnitude of the climax makes that wait well worth it.

Now, let's discuss a movie. Take Shelter is a suspense/thriller directed by Jake Nichols and starring Michael Shannon as Curtis, a quiet, hard-working member of his small, midwest town. Until now, Curtis's life has been normal. His wife Samantha, played by the talented Jessica Chastain, loves him and their deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) with a quiet, but attentive ferocity. Curtis seems content with his job in construction. He enjoys winding down from work with a beer or two, and he's a member of the Lion's Club. Small town everyman, no? But, then Curtis begins having visions--not just dreams, but intense, disturbing events that make him both paranoid and hyper-manic. As the plot takes shape, these visions haunt Curtis more and more until finally, he is compelled to build a tornado shelter capable of withstanding far more than tornadoes.

It is this performance by Shannon that really propels Take Shelter. His brooding eyes and half-slack jaw detail an interior struggle with his own apocalyptic fears and the fear that he is becoming increasingly delusional. Not a single word is wasted in Curtis's development, either. Every line delivers incredible tension, and each time Curtis speaks, we feel compelled to question the conflicts that arise between protecting those you love and allowing yourself to accept their protection. In ways, this struggle alludes to the Noah's ark narrative that so engrosses our cultural thought. We have always been consumed with the fear of social estrangement because of the need to fold fast to beliefs. Thus, the emotional toll in Take Shelter: there is a powerful `Sturm und Drang' here that elevates the plight of the individual as he falls victim to the wholesale wishes of his society at large.

In short, Take Shelter sends us down a euphonic and visual rabbit hole that perfectly combines atmosphere with mood. And while the conclusion is a while coming, it is certainly worth the effort.",1343174400,3,2527,4.899532710280374

Shannon and Chastain do a great job of complementing one another as husband and wife. The setting is very realistic which I also liked. The story builds throughout, so you have to be patient to let the story develop. Overall, I give a solid recommendation to see this film.

4990173,5,B006HGXGWU,"Before watching this film I read a review from a critic who said he was hard-pressed to recommend the movie even though he was giving it five stars.  It's dark, philosophical, and superbly acted - which is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.  The film revolves around its male lead who experiences terrifying dreams and hallucinations.  At times he feels they are prophetic, at other times he thinks he's developing schizophrenia (which his mother had).  Each carefully crafted scene presents enough evidence to both support and negate either possibility.  Visually, the film is timeless, yet it taps into contemporary fears regarding the economy and global warming.  The ending is a stroke of genius - although it took me a few moments to process.  And then I couldn't stop thinking about it.

This is filmmaking at its finest.  It's so perfectly crafted and nuanced that the real fun is the discussion you'll have afterwards.  If you're looking for glossy, mindless entertainment (and no, there is nothing wrong with escapism) then this is not a movie you will enjoy.",1341446400,6,1072,5.005649717514125

Shortly after the movie began though, I was hooked until the very last scenes.  It is a great psychological thriller as well as having some really good special effects, which are added at points to maximize the tension.  This movie surprised me by taking me from the point of being almost bored to being really frightened many times through the movie.

It seemed as this film progressed that the pace became slower...and slower...a.n.d......s.l.o.w.e.r. I was reminded of that great old Bob & Ray radio show about the slowest talker in the world.

4990183,5,B006HGXGWU,"Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, TAKE SHELTER is a movie about a man who has terrifying visions who actually might be a prophet, but whom no one believes because modern science says it can't be so.  The film stars Michael Shannon as Curtis. Curtis has a high-paying job that includes excellent health benefits. He's married to his beautiful wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain). They have one child, a daughter named Hannah, who is deaf. Thanks to the health insurance through Curtis' job, Hannah is eligible for a cochlear implant to restore part of her hearing. At the beginning of the film, Curtis' best friend and co-worker, Dewart (Shea Whigham) tells Curtis something to the effect that he's got a great life.

Then Curtis starts having nightmares. In some ways the dreams are more vivid than anything he has experienced in real life. In the dreams, he sees a storm of Apocalyptical proportions occur. People go crazy and someone is always chasing either him or his family. The dreams become more and more intense. So much so, that Curtis begins fixing up the old storm shelter in the backyard. As he does so, the dreams begin happening while he is awake and at work: he begins seeing flocks of birds and massive bolts of lightning that no one else can see, he feels drops of rain and gusts of wind that no one else can feel, and he hears the screams of his daughter as she's taken away by people who don't even exist. Curtis' mother is a schizophrenic and he fears that he might be suffering from the same disease. Is Curtis mentally unstable or is he a modern-day prophet?

TAKE SHELTER is an incredibly well-written film that has some amazing acting. Michael Shannon wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, but he should have been (as an actor, he puts both George Clooney and Brad Pitt to shame). Jessica Chastain gives off another great performances that were actually typical for her in 2011. All of the other supporting actors do a fine job, too.

The movie is a character-driven, slow-roasting drama that isn't for everyone. There's minimal dialogue and very little action. But a movie like TAKE SHELTER shouldn't have gobs of dialogue and lots of action.

TAKE SHELTER is highly recommended. It's one of the best movies that was released in 2011 and is an overlooked gem.",1336694400,9,2291,4.731829573934837
4990184,3,B006HGXGWU,"Michael Shannon is Curtis LaForche, an ordinary husband who starts seeing alarming visions. He firmly believes ""a storm"" is coming - by storm he means something catastrophic - and builds a shelter in the backyard for his family, but people around Curtis including his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) suspect that his recent ""strange"" behaviors may have something to do with mental disorder.

""Take Shelter"" is more like a psychological drama than a thriller, and its strength lies in the powerhouse performance of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain as a happily married couple, whose peaceful life with their lovely daughter slowly falls apart. Shannon's performance is actually borderline overacting, but is compelling nonetheless.

Writer and director Jeff Nichols keeps the film's ""apocalyptic"" factors to the minimum, focusing the change of the protagonist caused by his premonition that something terrible is going to happen. This is a wise decision, but unfortunately, the way he executed needs improvement.

Seeing dreams, or visions if you like, is one of the most overused devices in film. ""Take Shelter"" relies on too much on this ""dream"" sequence that happens once or twice too many. A more resourceful director would transform this hackneyed method into something more gripping, propelling the film's narrative forward in a more compelling way. Though several scenes show the director's unmistakable skills in building up tension, the whole plotline is weak and after all sluggish until the climax.

""Take Shelter"" succeeds most in creating a convincing portrait of a man who is tormented by unsettling visions. As to the nature of these visions, maybe you should not take them too seriously.",1336348800,3,1707,5.358208955223881

He has recurring nightmares of an apocalyptic storm which lead him to put the financial well-being of his family at risk to build a storm shelter.

This low-budget indie film is what you call a slow burn.  It will be too slow for some, while others will be mesmerized.  There are a few visual effects shots, but this is no CGI-laden disaster flick.  The performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (as his patient but concerned wife) are excellent. This is a type of film that is all about getting inside the character and great acting.  Action is minimal and anyone expecting an action film will be greatly disappointed.  Most of the conflict here is internal.

I would highly recommend renting this first if you haven't seen it.  Replay value will be low for a lot of people, as it is very slow-paced and somber.  The ending is designed to make you think and form your own interpretation (which might irritate you if you prefer things to be neatly wrapped up!).

I admit that the actors who played the protagonist and his devoted wife did amazing jobs, especially with the sorry excuse for a story they had to work with, but good acting alone was not enough to save this flick. I recognize that many people seem to drool over it, but I'm not one of them. And the ending? Curtis and his wife, gazing in rapt attention at what?  Storm clouds, you say? Wow. I thought maybe an asteroid might be approaching, or the sun going nova, or UFOs might be landing, but no, gee, there were these big grey storm clouds, and I was totally underwhelmed.

First, I just want to add that  if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality for ""Take Shelter"", you will definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!

With that being said, ""Take Shelter"" looks very good on DVD.  There are a lot of scenes that are shot outdoors, scenes with blue skies are vibrant. While I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, the film looks very good on DVD.

As for audio, the soundtrack features certain dream sequences that utilize the surround channels.  From Curtis' dog attacking him, getting into an accident, hearing the sounds of the crackling storm to the reality sequences such as ambiance during one crowd scene during a fight.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A unique story with a twist ending, writer/director Jeff Nichols' ""Take Shelter"" is a film that will surprise you but also captivate you with the wonderful performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain!

I have to admit that when I first watched the trailer for ""Take Shelter"", the first thing that came into my mind was the Russell Crowe 2001 film, ""A Beautiful Mind"".

Is this another film about schizophrenia?  But there is no denying that when this film started to win one award after another, perhaps there was more to this film than what we are given in the trailer.  And there is also no denying that the director of 2007 ""Shotgun Stories"", Jeff Nichols is a person that has creative ideas and suffice to say, his name is being mentioned quite often.  The same can also be said for the film's talents, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain.  And so far, Chastain has literally made me a fan with her performances on ""The Tree of Life"", ""The Help"" and her bit part in the ""Texas Killing Fields"".

But it's Nichols story that starts to unnerve viewers. Here is a normal family that will probably be destroyed by the actions of the protagonist Curtis.  He's a hardworking family man, but when he starts having these dark nightmares of being attacked and getting in accidents with his daughter and needless to say, he starts to act on them.  You know that things are not going to look good for Curtis.

And as for the apocalyptic dream of a major storm coming his way, its the big part of the storyline as Curtis dedicates his life into building this storm shelter.  He wants to protect his family and be prepared, but of course, with his mother being mentally ill, many wonder if Curtis is also ill.

But it's the way that ""Take Shelter"" ends that makes this film so satisfying and unforgettable.

As for the DVD release, you do get a pretty in-depth audio commentary by Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon and also a few features such as deleted scenes, a featurette featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the writer/director and cast members plus a Q&A between Michael Shannon & Shea Whigham.

Overall, ""Take Shelter"" is an impressive film from Jeff Nichols and I would not be surprised if we start to see and hear more from this talented writer and filmmaker.  Unfortunately, the film was snubbed for any Academy Award nominations considering the number of awards it had won internationally, but still, ""Take Shelter"" is a fantastic film with a engrossing story with powerful performances.

4990192,3,B006HGXGWU,"I read the reviews on amazon before renting it & several people called it ""excellent, masterpiece "" etc,  so I took a chance. The movie was good...but a little slow. However, this type of story has been done before & better. Michael Shannon was in another movie called ""Bug""..same premise as this ""is he crazy or is it real"". See ""Bug"", its a better movie, fast paced & it keeps you guessing.",1335484800,2,392,4.444444444444445
4990193,5,B006HGXGWU,"""Take Shelter"" is definitely not the movie for you if you need fast-paced action.  It is also a little strange.  It seems like a lot of the people who did not enjoy this movie disliked it because they were expecting a movie where you run from tornadoes as they rip through the town.  This movie is not Twister!

With that said, it is the type of movie that has subtle bits of plot development that build up as time progresses.  It is a tiny bit horror (Curtis, the main character, has some pretty scary dreams!), and very much a psychological drama.  At first, you're not sure if Curtis is going crazy, and as the movie progresses, you feel more unsure of his sanity. The ending is somewhat ambiguous, which I don't see as a bad thing.

This movie is really driven by the characters, and the relationships between them.  You see Curtis trying do what he thinks is best for himself and his family, while everything seems to fall apart because of dreams and what they are doing to his mind.  One of the other reviewers called Take Shelter ""A portrait of courage,"" and I would have to agree! Both Curtis and his wife have such emotional courage. If you are afraid of tornadoes, this movie may be pretty frightening at times!

One thing I have to mention is how dead-on the depiction of small town, Northeastern Ohio is.  The way the people interact with one another, how people speak, dress, and drive.  This added a special touch for me, someone who is from the area, and added a bit of reality for me.",1335484800,3,1500,4.434306569343065
4990194,4,B006HGXGWU,"What would you do if you thought that you and your family were in danger of being killed by a deadly storm?

Take Shelter shows us a glimpse inside the mind of Curtis (Michael Shannon), who has vivid dreams of an approaching storm. In his dreams, his wife and young daughter are in terrible danger. The film sometimes blurs the line between fantasy and reality and we see events unfold that are later revealed as dreams. His dog bites him in one such event and unidentified strangers attack him and his daughter in another episode.

We all have nightmares, but Curtis experiences more than just dreams. He also hears the storm approaching. While he is working outside with his colleague, Dewart (Shea Whigham), Curtis hears a thunderbolt strike. Dewart doesn't hear a thing.

Do you trust what you see and hear without question? What would you think if you could hear things that nobody else could?

If what Curtis experiences is really happening, how is that possible? Is it some form of intervention from God? It is some kind of psychic ability? Is the subconscious mind revealing what Curtis knows on some level?

To complicate matters, Curtis was left alone outside a store as a child when his mother had a mental breakdown and just walked away. He visits her in a nursing home because he fears that he might be going down the same path. It's such a realistic possibility that we are drawn into his world. Is he going crazy? He seems rational most of the time, but then he experiences another dream or hallucination.

His wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), is more than patient. We get the feeling that their relationship is strong and she clearly loves him. In a good relationship, it should be possible to talk openly about such problems, but Curtis initially hides everything from her. This is done out of fear. He's afraid of what might be happening to him and he's embarrassed about his experiences. He visits a doctor and a psychiatrist without her knowledge and even makes a serious financial decision without discussing it.

Lack of communication is a huge problem in most relationships. If you are with the person you are supposed to trust more than anyone in the world, why can't you voice all of your fears? Curtis is eventually compelled to talk to Samantha because there's no other way to explain his bizarre behavior.

Take Shelter shows us what occurs in the mind of a tormented man. The tension slowly builds and we can sense that something is going to happen. Is Curtis going crazy, or will all of his actions be justified? I won't reveal that here.

The ending is somewhat controversial. I liked it a lot and think it was the perfect way to conclude the story. Shannon does a great job in the final scenes and there's one particular expression which speaks volumes. Unfortunately, I can't talk about it without ruining things.

The film only cost around $1 million to make, but it achieves more than many big-budget productions. The story felt real to me and I could easily empathize with everything Curtis went through. The two hours went by fast and the tension was incredible.",1335484800,2,3101,4.725925925925926

4990199,5,B006HGXGWU,"I just want to be clear that this review is coming from someone who doesn't `get' Michael Shannon.  I don't think he's a good actor.  He annoys me.  His praised performances, including the Oscar nominated one, have always felt forced and obnoxious and awkward and quite frankly I've never liked him and usually wind up pointing my finger in his direction when explaining the `worst' part of a film.

This film, and his performance inside of it, was amazing.

`Take Shelter' seems to be a very divisive film.  The ambiguity that laces so much of the film, especially Shannon's character Curtis, lies at the core of that division.  You either embrace all that writer/director Jeff Nichols has to say here, or you label it a joke.  Honestly, there are few films that say more about the modern horrors of the struggle to survive quite like `Take Shelter'.  With a sharp sense of purpose, this film uses subtle imagery to pinpoint the root of Curtis's madness without every hitting you over the head with it.

You may label my opinion a huge SPOILER, but I don't see it that way since I'm merely stating my interpretation of events, not their actual intent.

For me, `Take Shelter' uses a looming storm to signify the pressing concern of financial instability.  Using seeming subliminal shots, Nichols highlights the weight on Curtis's shoulders from his own financial responsibilities and the fact that, as each day passes the eventual collapse of all that he has is going to take over.  His daughter has health issues that he must take care of.  His wife works hard to preserve a level of sanity in the house, but you can see the weight around her eyes of simply worrying about her future and that of her family.  Curtis sees so much on his plate and then, it all starts to unravel.  Everyone around him feels like an enemy as he envisions an incoming storm that will devastate and destroy.  Through dreams he experiences the pain of losing his daughter through odd means and this, for me, further implicates the idea that his floundering ability to provide for his family is what is aching at the core of Curtis's mental state.

He's slowly going crazy.

Michael Shannon is superb here.  Friends of mine had likened his performance to that of Heath Ledger's in `Brokeback Mountain' (every word, a struggle) and I get that.  It is so impeccably rendered.  The scene where he opens the storm door alone is just ""wow"".  You can see the relief etched with utter confusion all over his face.

HOW CAN THIS NOT BE REAL?

Jessica Chastain has had a banner year, and this is probably her finest performance.  I mean, she finds every ounce of emotional compassions here and pushes them forward in the most honest of ways.  Nichols works wonders with the air here, creating sharply intensified atmosphere that really keeps the viewer locked into what is going on.  That ending is brilliant (I know, so many gripe there but seriously, the ambiguity isn't so hard to cut through it you think about it) and the visuals are impressive.  Those storms are eerily reminiscent of our own personal demons.",1334534400,2,3084,4.7121495327102805
4990200,5,B006HGXGWU,"No-name, normal-looking character actors perform splendidly in a film that is short on dialogue but provides an ambience that quietly creates and maintains start-to-finish tension with more subtly and understated style than anything I've seen before.  This is neither an over-the-top action-packed thriller nor a horror show that scares you out of your skin, but Take Shelter is so remarkably well made that it still leaves the viewer emotionally exhausted and wondering what exactly he or she has just seen.

I have no name for a suitable genre, but this one-of-a-kind low-budget gem doesn't miss a beat in telling a tale of average people of the most decent sort caught up in a psychological and metaphysical maelstrom that no one understands.  There is nothing overwhelmingly appealing about any one of the characters, but they are the kind of folks we'd all like to a have as family, friends, and neighbors.  Nevertheless, difficult times, misunderstood encounters, and failures to make sense of the senseless take a toll on decent individuals and wholesome relationships.  Finding explanations for the inexplicable is nerve-wracking and can be pushed to maddening extremes.

Take Shelter hints at a variety of narratives, but viewers who like things neat and tidy will probably be disappointed.  However, those who find interest in low-keyed characterization and the emotional pull of a cinematic context that is both plainly ordinary and decidedly off-beat will find this film rewarding.  I belong to the group that gives priority to a clearly defined narrative, but after giving it some thought, I'm glad I watched Take Shelter.  It's about as skillfully evocative as a film can get.",1334275200,2,1690,5.229629629629629
4990201,5,B006HGXGWU,"Jeff Nichols' new film, ""Take Shelter"" is a marvelous example of what happens when a group of talented people come together to tell a smart story and make a good film, despite the fact that few will see it and even fewer will appreciate it. I already know not everyone likes this movie, there are other comments right here that in no uncertain terms say so, some even yell so, this is, of course, because the movie is something of a challenge for many viewers. It plays out as a mystery, we've already lost many people here brought up on Hollywood effects driven blockbusters that explains it all in the trailers, a psychological drama and a character study, it is what is missing so often today at the multiplex or new on Netflix, an adult thriller aimed at a willing audience.

Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, a relative newcomer with only one other film under his belt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shotgun-Stories/dp/B0016MJ6I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shotgun Stories</a>&nbsp;which played at Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival a few years back, Nichols writes a compelling script that translates into a gripping movie where things may not be what they seem, or as we the audience begin to care, we fear that they are what they seem and we don't like what we see. This works largely because of the fine acting of Michael Shannon, a great actor giving one of his greatest performances as the central character, Curtis. Curtis is a working class midwesterner who as the movie begins is plagued by a continuing series of nightmares about a coming near apocalyptic storm. Jessica Chastain is equally good, just how many good performances did she give in 2011, as Samantha, Curtis' loving wife, she gives the character the proper empathy to emote reactions from the viewer, we can see through her that sometimes being the witness can be the harder thing to have to be.

The only major flaw I can find with the movie is that it is perhaps drawn out a little bit too much. There are those who will, and do find the leisurely way the film unfolds to be boring, I think a lot of these people are too caught up in the modern era of instant gratification. When one is brought up on video games and movies based on such or easily transformed to the medium, expecting patience is difficult, if not all together futile. However, I do think that a small amount of tightening up in the center of the film might have made it's flow a little more gripping.

The ending is the kind that I normally hate in a movie like this, it is ambiguous, I don't have a problem with ambiguity, but the way it is played sometimes can test a viewer's tolerance. Here though, I don't believe that to be the case. The ending seems to me to be the exact right conclusion, and it knows when to stop. I had a strong emotional reaction to this film, in no small part due to the near brilliance of the movie's final ten minutes or so.

For the right audience, this is one of the best films of 2011. It is also the best thriller in a long time, period. I hope beyond all hope it finds a good audience, critical reaction has been up to this point, mostly favorable. In fact, many were surprised by Shannon's omission from the Oscar race. I say see it and I look forward to future films from this talent new filmmaker.

4990205,3,B006HGXGWU,"Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a construction foreman living in a rural Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and life is good.  They do have a 6 or 7 year old daughter who is deaf which creates challenges, but they seem able to cope and they are happy.  Then Curtis begins having horrible nightmares about a coming apocalypse.  At first he tries to ignore it, although sometimes even the physical effects persist.  While his wife and fellow workers notice differences in his behavior, Curtis brushes it off before eventually getting help.  His mother (Kathy Baker) was institutionalized years earlier for schizophrenia, so he believes he may also be a victim.

The pressure of the delusions causes him to focus on expanding an old storm cellar as he foresees the coming storm.  As Curtis sinks deeper and deeper into what most believe is mental illness, Shannon's performance is remarkable and believable reminding me of another movie from 2011 involving another form of psychosis, ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" with Elizabeth Olsen.  The year also gave us a couple other movies in terms of similar theme.  For unusual sci-fi with strange behavior check out ""Melancholia"" and ""Another Earth.""

Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the movie does seem to take an awfully long time to get from point A to B, which sometimes adds to the suspense but sometimes is just confounding.  Jessica Chastain as Curtis' loving and steadfast wife is another performance in what has become a remarkable career.  The controversial ending may leave some satisfied, other will be left hanging.

The Blu ray disc is truly excellent.  The 1080p transfer is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is perfectly clear from beginning to end.  The colors are crisp and properly saturated.

4990206,3,B006HGXGWU,"There are NO SPOILERS here!

I knew nothing about this movie when I ordered it on Netflix other than these two things:

1) the trailer looked interesting, and

2) Michael Shannon intrigues me

On that basis, I ordered ""Take Shelter,"" and while I can not say I loved it, I can not say I hated it either.  Hence the three stars.

Understand this: it's a good, thoughtful movie, but the unhurried, deliberate pace is only for those who like serious films more interested in building characterization than a frenetic plot.

I do believe this movie is well made in the sense that it gives us a realistic construction of a man on the edge and does so within the confines of a middle income working class family in a midwestern state not prone toward hysteria or even colorful words and sustained monologues.

This is, in fact, the exact opposite of a David Mamet film, wherein words are batted around like a Jai Alai ball.  There are long scenes in which Michael Shannon slumps on a chair looking glum, and others stare at him.  LONG scenes.

But understand they are appropriate to the seriousness of the subject.  It has the feel of an indie film on within tight funding, and writer/director Jeff Nichols is able to do a good job within an apparently low budget creating apocalyptic visions that seem to exist solely within the head of character Curtis LaForche, played by Michael Shannon.  (Is the name ""LaForche"" important: a misspelling of ""fork,"" as in perhaps a character in the fork in the road, deciding where to go?)

The fact that he has these vivid dreams not only when he sleeps, but also when his eyes are wide open and he is awake fully awake is complicated by the additional fact that his mother is in a care facility because when she was approximately his age she had a breakdown due to her own paranoid schizophrenia.

Given the obvious misgivings he must himself obsess over, Curtis feels the less said, the better, except that his wife--well played by Jessica Chastain--has noticed his odd behavior and is seriously frightened for AND of him.  Trying her best to deal with a deaf daughter who needs an operation, and the fact that the only money they can scrape together through his job, odd work, and yard sales is being funneled away to build a shelter he believes necessary to shield his family from the upcoming disaster he foresees.

Nichols is not interested in making a sci-fi film, but in constructing a careful moment-by-moment character study of a man on the edge, as upset as he is by his visions of the end of the world as he is that it all may simply be his descent into madness, just like his mother.  Chastain is also portrayed as a fully realized character who is trying so hard to do the right thing: to stand by her man as he crumbles before her very eyes.

I had seen only one other film with Michael Shannon: the EXTREMELY odd ""Bug,"" which should indeed creep you out if you ever do see it.  He is quite haunting there, too, as he portrays a man who may or may not be there to rescue Ashley Judd.  It's all a testament to his face: a large misshapen head like Dudley Do-Right's after a catastrophic motorcycle accident.  His jutting jaw and obsessed eyes register misgivings like a seismograph, giving off a look that is equally paranoic and frightening.

So see ""Take Shelter"" if you are interested in watching a well made movie about people, and only secondarily in watching a movie that may or may not be about a disaster.  It takes forever to get where it wants to go, but rest assured this movie delivers a punch when it does.

If, however, you do not like long character studies, steer clear.  This film is not for you.",1333497600,,3658,4.529680365296803

4990210,4,B006HGXGWU,"I tried to get this video at block buster but none of the stores carried it in stock, so I spent a couple dollars and viewed it on Instant Video at Amazon. It was well worth the money.

The story is essentially about CURTIS (Michael Shannon) a father husband, and  worker in a small mid-western  town that is experiencing nightmares, visions, and is hearing things concerning some major disaster in the future. These experiences go to the extent of disrupting almost every facet of his life. His mother was a schizophrenic but he feels compelled to follow after these visions, all the while worrying whether he will lose everything and be committed to a hospital.

I know some schizophrenics in my life and I felt that Michael Shannon's acting was spot on as far as depicting CURTIS (the main character of the story). It seems like Shannon never looks at the camera and often looks off into the distance when speaking to other characters. When Curtis speaks, it is in small chunks, as most schizophrenics communicate. He also portrays the emotional blunting effect of schizophrenia well.  All of this impressed me that he had educated himself about schizophrenics. Only in the town hall dinner scene, does Curtis really come out of his shell in an emotional explosion.

Curtis's wife, SAMANTHA, is played by Jessica Chastain. The role is of a fairly stereo typical mid-western house wife and mother; but Chastain brings life to it and I could not help but like the character and respect choices when it came to her husband and child.

The cinematography adds flavor to the movie of a sort of impending  doom, either for the character or the small town.  The colors are muted except for in a few scenes. The special effects are believable and just enough to add to the story and not overwhelm it.

All in all this was a good movie, the twists and turns the movie takes keep the interest going until the end where we find out whether Curtis is crazy or somehow a prophet.",1333065600,3,1969,4.664739884393064

The cinematography of the sky both clear and stormy, and the birds, and the open land... tremendous. Acting across the board - all leads and supporting actors were of equal caliber. I never saw anyone ""act"" throughout the entire film. Dialogue all convinced me. The way the ambient sound effects and music danced with each other was perfect. The shots, and the pacing in the editing... also amazing.

The only reason I can't give this movie a full 5 stars right now is because of the ending which was powerful, but left me a bit confused.

4990217,4,B006HGXGWU,"I remember talking to a clinical person about someone we were both assisting.  I was really struggling to understand ""schizotypal personality disorder.""  She was doing her best to describe the disorder when she finally said, ""Have you ever seen Robert De Niro in Taxing Driver.""  Well of course I had and the lights came on immediately.  (I'm not endorsing that character as the best example of schizotypal disorder, but it helped.)

We live in a visual age and why not take advantage of that as we work to introduce people to mental illness?  Somebody said: ""A picture is worth a thousand words.""
Take Shelter is a motion picture worth even more than that.
What fascinates throughout is we are not sure we're watching the emergence of paranoid schizophrenia or just the normal anxiety we all feel living in these times.  Is Curtis really sick or just overly sensitive to what we all know is coming?

The poet W.H. Auden wrote of the ""Age of Anxiety"" -

Faces along the bar
Cling to their average day;
The lights must never go out
The music must always play ...
Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the night
Who have never been happy or good.

The unsettling sense we all live with is palpable in this film.  Curtis is a hero because he doesn't run from it; he is trying to understand it.  He visits a doctor and a therapist, reads a huge tome called Understanding Mental Illness, and visits his mother, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenic twenty years earlier.  Perhaps he's inherited the family gene.  But the dreams persist, as do the storms he sees in the horizon.

Another layer to Curtis' personal agony is trying to care for his family.  While watching I kept asking myself; `What's wrong with going to extremes to care for your family?'  Nothing, of course, the task is only made that much harder with so little understanding and even less support.

Prophets and heroes are not always the sane ones.

This film is a masterpiece in portraying an emerging mental illness crisis.  It's also a fascinating character study of what many of us experience right below the surface.  I hope it might finally gain more appreciation for the service it performs.

It should have been a clue to me why it never received much exposure.  If you enjoy watching paint dry you will love this movie.

4990221,5,B006HGXGWU,Excellent movie.  It's rare these days to find a movie that can stir up all kinds of emotions in you which really made me feel connected to the main characters.  The movie had us talking about it after we watched it and I am still thinking about it the next day.  I would definitely watch this movie again.,1332028800,3,306,4.241379310344827

Doing so will save you from a disastrous movie, which features fifteen minutes worth of story drawn out over two agonizing hours. Have a nap instead, and enjoy the time you spent doing something constructive instead of soaking up this little train wreck.

Don't worry: no spoilers are revealed in the following discussion of this movie's events, because the outcome is utterly ambiguous. This is not the kind of ambiguity that gets you talking about the movie, talking about the ending or talking about the characters. Instead it's the kind of ambiguity that forces you do to the sad calculations about all the other things you might have done with your time had you not been watching this.

Blue-collar Ohio resident Curtis has a decent job, a nice enough house, a pretty red-haired wife, a special needs (hearing-impaired) daughter...and a dog. Oh yeah: he's also got a mom who was diagnosed and institutionalized with paranoid schizophrenia at the same age Curtis is now.

In the months after his father's death (an event whose significance is pointed out, but is a big red herring...along with bizarre visits to his mother and from his brother), Curtis starts having bad dreams, daytime hallucinations and paralyzing panic attacks. In response, first he makes dog live outside, and then decides he MUST upgrade his existing storm shelter...by adding a 40-foot ISO shipping container. After wetting the bed during one dream, he goes to see his doctor (who is oh-so-coincidentally familiar with his mom's case) to discuss his symptoms. And even though it's not too hard for him to arrange a $6000 home improvement loan and wrangle company equipment to bury the shipping container in his back yard, it is WAY too hard for him to make the two hour drive to Columbus to see the psychiatrist his warm and fuzzy family doctor recommends...until way too late in the unraveling of his life.

Oh yeah: we also learn his employer's generous health plan will pay for implants needed to restore his daughter's hearing...and it will only take six weeks to get the surgery scheduled! Director Jeff Nichols should have just put up a big flashing neon said that said: ""Curtis is about to get fired, lose his insurance and really agitate his wife."" Of course he does get fired (for using the company equipment at home), and from here the movie proceeds into its climax and denouement, when Curtis has an epic meltdown at a Lions' Club dinner, followed by a midwest weather event that places the whole family first in the shelter and then at the beach to confront his --and their-- fears about actual and metaphoric storms.

Here's the thing: most of the characters are likeable enough and the acting is good enough that this movie could have been turned into an engaging story about something...if it could have ever figured out what that something is. This movie is part Twilight Zone episode, part pick-any-M. Night Shyamalan ""thriller"", part ""Whose Eating Gilbert Grape""...but not the right parts of any of them. And while I can accept an ambiguous ending, I can't accept a movie that is at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be through pacing that is deliberately glacial. The time is not filled with engaging dialog or revealing actions, but with long views of stuff and people who often aren't doing anything at all.",1332028800,6,3388,4.885217391304348

As for the preceding hour and forty-five minutes, it moves at a deathly slow pace most of the time. The camera lingers on people who are doing little but staring or moving slowly as if drugged. This could be helped with editing, but even so, I wonder if a story about a man's life unraveling (almost) due to forces he cannot understand can be made into high entertainment without some sort of payoff. There is very little payoff.

The movie was well done in every aspect and the lead actor must be a master script chooser as I have yet to see a movie he has been in that I didn't enjoy immensely. He is also very talented.

Take Shelter is not so much about it's premise as it is the ramifications of it, with small town construction worker Curtis LaForche experiencing vivid apocalyptic dreams, what follows, and makes up most of the movie is how these visions affect his behavior and how those around him react to it. Much of the film is built around somewhat mundane phenomena such as Curtis fortifying his storm shelter or visiting a therapist, these everyday occurrences become engaging due to the constant sense of dread the film employs, the film is built up in such a way that there seems to be some great threat looming overhead, as if some great storm might be just around the corner. A well made intellectual drama, Take shelter is not for everybody, the film takes its time to build it's story in a way many will find boring and unnecessary, but those who are fascinated by human drama will likely be spellbound",1331251200,7,1124,4.597014925373134
4990236,3,B006HGXGWU,"TAKE SHELTER is a perplexing film.  Is it basically a portrait of a man's descent into madness?  Or is it a parable of a prophet warning people of impending doom?  And is the climax merely a dream---or the prophet's fulfillment?
I can appreciate complexity in plotting but can be frustrated when the writers don't commit to a fully told story.  That's what keeps me from having a totally satisfactory experience.
I certainly can't fault the actors.  Michael Shannon gives a devastatingly real performance as the tormented husband/father who fears he may be losing his mind.  The ubiquitous Jessica Chastain adds another star in her growing career as the wife who takes her vows seriously.  She and Shannon are truly believable as the couple and the heart of the movie.
TAKE SHELTER requires patience--it moves slowly and the director uses pauses and silence often to emphasize the gravity of Shannon's dilemma.  Shannon's eruption at the Lions Club dinner is handled brilliantly.  His performance is Oscar-worthy although he got snubbed.  He and Chastain will be holding one of those statuettes in the future, I'm sure.

4990238,4,B006HGXGWU,"As this film got rolling, I thought, ""Oh no! Lead actor Michael Shannon really is being typecast!"" I felt he'd played this role of a schizophrenic with an increasingly dangerous obsession before - and before. ""Take Shelter"" looks like an alternate version of the movie ""Bug""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bug-Special-Edition/dp/B000T5O48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bug (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;in which he starred - only instead of bodily infestation, here he becomes consumed with worry over the likelihood of a coming Armageddon of storms.

Shannon does disturbance extraordinarily well. But I began to fade from this film, as I became convinced I'd seen it all before. The principal thing that held my interest was the photography. The shots of ominous gatherings of clouds and birds and Shannon's darkening horizon are arresting.

But wait. This movie does take a turn into some wholly different implications. Its novelty comes so late in the movie though, many habitual movie-goers might not hang in there to see it. They might leave with the impression this in another Shannon progression into madness.

If you haven't seen ""Bug"" or ""My Son, My Son,"" you can appreciate this film as a singular tour de force performance by Shannon. If you have seen those other movies about obsession, I suggest you wait and see this movie through.

4990239,5,B006HGXGWU,"Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon have accomplished a portrait of paranoid schizophrenia which is the most accurate (to those who have known these sufferers) to date with the exception of a far bleaker film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clean-Shaven-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000H5U5RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clean, Shaven (The Criterion Collection)</a>.

The difference here is that Nichols wants to show how deeply linked the hallucinations, dreams and daily disturbances of a schizophrenic are to daily reality, in particular to our global feeling that the next shoe might drop at any time.  If anyone watching imagines that Curtis' behavior is unrealistic or that Shannon's natural ability to be eccentric and frightening are exaggerations of what these people (and their loved ones) go through, think again.  Having worked with the homeless/mentally ill (unfortunately a lot of men and women like Curtis simply fall through the cracks) I have always made it a policy to keep apocalyptic material AWAY from them.  The miracle Nichols pulls off here is to reflect so expertly what happens when these symptoms first start developing through Curtis' mind.

A blue collar construction worker and generally an average man (Officer Van Alden from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boardwalk-Empire-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B003Y5HWJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boardwalk Empire: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;is absent here)  Curtis has a wonderful wife (Jessica Chastain who resembles Mia Farrow to an almost disturbing degree) and a sweet little girl who is handicapped (Tova Stewart).  His buddy on the construction site (Shea Wigham)is the first one to really notice that something's just not right with our man.  As the result of exactly one simple rainstorm, Curtis begins to develop brief but very potent hallucinations involving thunder, rain, and his dog.  Since thunder can make certain canines so scared they turn vicious I'm pretty sure Nichols is not setting Curtis up as a prophet proper.  He is trying to communicate the subtle and explosive panic developing in Curtis' mind.

The first move that lets you know this guy is hurting is when he makes a financially risky move on a tight budget, taking out a home improvement loan for an old tornado shelter.  He puts his dog in a wire rimmed fence in the backyard though he's done nothing to deserve this punishment.

He then begins to stock up food, has his buddy help him steal equipment from work to dig a bigger tunnel in his yard, and gets laid off.  His explosion at the Community Benefit Dinner is the most representative of the character's struggle, screaming about a storm that is coming with the zeal of a Pentecostal preacher from the work of Flannery O' Connor.  The misery that mental illness of this kind inflicts on families is reflected almost perfectly here.  His wife makes ends meet only after realizing her husband is disturbed.

The ending is what people are arguing about.  It really could be anything--a shared subjective vision, a hallucination Curtis has when he is asleep and about to leave for the beach on the doctor's orders.  I think Nichols was borrowing from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Wave-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005QAPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Wave (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;and a quote in that film: ""A dream is the shadow of something real.""

4990240,5,B006HGXGWU,"****This review contains spoilers****

This movie is scary, and I can honestly say it shook me to the core. I'm chalking the 1-star reviews up to just mistaken expectations: this is NOT an action film, and it's not paced like an action film. If you expect that, prepare for disappointment. Sad to say, many people (myself included, at this point in the ""review"") confuse reviews for meandering expressions of baseless opinion. In the interest of injecting this review with some protein. I want to begin with a bit of an aside:

Why does it seem like everyone insists on assuming the climaxes in movies are dreams? Is this the Lost effect? The Inception effect? Isn't claiming it's all a dream merely a cheap fix for an ending that doesn't tie up neatly with our notion of endings?

This movie is about love and loss (of mental health, of family, of a way of life); it's about the epic Real that we cannot explain with our frames of reference but only with silence. It's also a movie about an event that does or doesn't happen. I'm going to discuss certain aspects of the film: the use of minor characters to develop and texture that of Curtis, the main characters, and the interplay between husband and wife during their vacation (the final scene).

Mental illness is capable of being an apocalypse. Specifically, mental illness and natural disaster take us outside of civilization and behavior. Acting along prescribed behavioral lines in both cases is either impossible and/or difficult and not what the situation calls for. We see Michael Shannon's character as someone who first plays it off, then attempts to reject it with modern medicine, and only finally embracing it. They will never understand, I imagined him thinking.

At first I was skeptical of introducing ""sideline"" characters for one or two scenes (the mother, the brother), only to never mention them again. On second thought, though, the brother showing up out of concern and leaving with the dog was interesting and very well done. Here's why: sometimes having characters come in and out and then totally disappear from the plot annoys viewers because this leaves behind loose ends and questions. In this case, it wasn't a loose end at all: people come in and out of our lives. And in a family fractured by a mother's mental illness, the distant relationship of the brothers is awkward and palpable. It's here we see Shannon's character chase away his brother, his dog (""man's best friend""), then his best friend. He's left at the end to fend for himself and his family precisely because he's severed ties in order to save himself and his family. The ending on the deck shows us a picture of desperation in the face of catastrophic disaster which ""ironically"" (only insofar as we expect nothing to go wrong on vacation) happens during the vacation taken to get away from his shelter and illness. And yet the catastrophe is always near. Nature knows: the birds always know; the daughter knows, and she feels it. Her signing on the beach illustrates this. She's just felt the earthquake. She didn't feel the storm while they were in the shelter, and it's what gives the father strength to open the door: the moment is expressed with silence, because there's no explanation why they're alive. Just luck. I've written on imdb that this could be a father's wish that his hearing impaired daughter ""join the world"" and interact with the same ""normative"" organic interconnectedness that our senses bring about, except that even the minor characters in this film struggle with alienation and uncertainty. Minor characters mention how lucky the family is to have good health coverage, a good job. Several times we hear about risks ""in this economy."" For the main character and his family, things are pretty good. Until the illness. Letting go and getting away from the shelter, only to have our need to rely on our ""illness"" come rushing back into focus -- two water spouts, tidal wave, brown rain -- is probably not how we envision a partner or spouse regaining trust in our mental acuity.

The wife's face in the final scene reflects the disbelief that the main character struggles with until he embraces his illness as something more than illness. For a moment, we see the projection of his confusion and ""can this really be happening?"" in her expression. Who can't relate to the feeling of beginning to understand while simultaneously questioning whether we're not the ones losing our grasp on reality? Coming to this realization is textured by the gravity of what came before: that while being supportive, the wife hasn't understood the husband's illness because to understand it would mean to know that your vacation would lead to your death. There is no *actual* way to prepare and take shelter because disaster is sudden, much like the onset of the husband's illness. So the wife can only frame her husband's dreams as indicative of an illness. She can only do that, until the end. It's this last scene's switch (the disbelief in him to now what we're witnessing) that makes it necessary. I found myself wishing at first that they had just ended it with the family looking toward the ocean, like the blinding light when Shannon's character opens the shelter door earlier on, but my wish seemed even more exaggerated (like the ""event"" that occurs outside in the beginning of The Road, for example) and leading at this point. Ending it this way, Nichols downplays the event and instead opens the dialog about just how little we know about mental illness. What a mesmerizing film!",1331078400,21,5546,4.844936708860759
4990241,4,B006HGXGWU,"Here is a strange and twisty cinematic take on what has become a very popular viewing theme this past while since the release of '2012'. The great Ebert gave it two thumbs up simply because of its creative ending, and I would heartily concur for that and other reasons. When it comes to handling a clich of a subject - the apocalypse - 'Take Shelter' seems to be drawing from the biblical story of Noah. Rest assured, this movie is not another 'Evan Almighty' spoof on how to save people from their own environmental irresponsibility. Instead of building an ark, however, Curtis, with the tentative support of his wife and child, ventures into a half-cocked notion of building an impregnable storm shelter on the outskirts of a little Texas oil town in the middle of Tornado Alley. This is, ironically, Bible-Belt land but Curtis finds it hard to enlist the help of his God-fearing neighbours. They're just too busy making money drilling for gas and oil to take him seriously about the big one coming. To complicate matters, Curtis comes from a family with a history of schizophrenia which makes his visions potentially suspect. This low-budget, even-keeled, and well-managed movie has a number of timely confrontations where Curtis and his immediate family put everything on the line to see this disjointed scheme through one way or the other. The interesting thing here is that the filmmaker keeps the action moving in the direction of a climax that the audience isn't entirely prepared for. While Curtis is bracing for the big one, his loyal and long-suffering wife and child are hoping for a medical recovery with life returning to normal. At this juncture, the plot has a potentially win-win ending to it. If the world comes to an end, as foreshadowed by darkening skies and lots of heavy rain, Curtis becomes the hero and makes a believer out of his sceptical wife. If it doesn't pan out, his wife will then be able to help a shattered Curtis back to normalcy. Watch this movie if you want to see how the screen writers throw a curve at the audience who, if they are anyway like me, may have been lulled into thinking that this film is simply a parody on those who would fixate out of fear on end-times.",1330905600,2,2209,4.695876288659794

4990243,2,B006HGXGWU,"When blue collar everyman Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) experiences a series of disturbing, apocalyptic visions of a strange storm, he calmly takes precautions to save his family. In the aftermath of his visions, Curtis is haunted by his mother's schizophrenia and the real fear of losing his family due to a series of lunatic choices that backfire in the worst possible ways.

In _Take Shelter_, writer/director Jeff Nichols has given us a Twilight Zone episode for the arthouse movie crowd. The idea of a powerful evil lurking in the small town Ohio suburbs feels ripped from a David Lynch film, and protagonist Curtis, his dedicated wife, and their deaf, 6-year-old daughter prove the perfect framing characters for the impending doom.

Packed with career-making acting, _Take Shelter_ is a deliberate nightmare, mimicking the kind of slow-paced horror ethos found in European frightfests of the '70s and '80s. Excellent, expansive cinematography gives us not only a perfect front row seat for Curtis's descent into madness but also an in-your-face look at the stark visage of actor Michael Shannon as the nervous tics take hold. Each dream unfolds with thunder, and we are sucked into its swirling paranoia.

Despite all the accolades for _Take Shelter_, it contains enough weaknesses so as to collapse for most viewers.

When a film's premise and its plotline can be written in their entirety with the same dozen words, that's a depth problem. As noted, _Take Shelter_ has the feel of a Twilight Zone episode--""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" immediately springs to mind-- but an episode of that show ran for just under 25 minutes. This film runs 121. Though director Nichols lavishes care on every scene to the benefit of its creepiness, better editing might have trimmed this to an equally worth 100 minutes. And in the end, this is a one-note film. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned Twilight Zone episode knows the course of _Take Shelter_ within its first ten minutes. With the ending inevitable, the journey becomes more of a slog. That another 111 minutes follow might have viewers hitting their remote's fast forward button, which defeats the point of the director's attention to detail.

Certainly, with most American films amped up on adrenaline, audiences need to learn how to appreciate a slower film. But such a film needs to deliver more than an interminable trudge to a predetermined finish. _Take Shelter_ simply doesn't deliver more than the inevitable. This is shame for such a well-made film.

As to the DVD itself, the transfer is sharp and the sound perfect. This version of the DVD lacked frills, and I suspect all the typical extras were held back for the Blu-Ray version.

People are going insane and hurting other people and animals are behaving strangely. This dream is so real it seems like he is living it and real life may be the dream. He is terrified! He trusts no one, not even his pet dog!

He spends his family's limited income on expanding his underground storm shelter and loses his job. His mission is to protect his family and especially his deaf daughter. His wife is on the verge of leaving him and the small town he lives in believes he is crazy. He thinks he is going insane like his mother went insane at the age of 30....

Director and writer Jeff Nichols has written a script reminiscent of a Stephen King novel. A troubled man thinking he is doing the right thing but to the outside world it looks like he is acting irrational. This is a well written and acted movie and Michael Shannon does a perfect job portraying Curtis LaForche. The movie does move a little slow at times but it is done on purpose to make you understand the dilemma and mental anguish that the protagonist is going through.

Curtis's obsessive compulsive behavior is ruining his life! Is it a premonition or insanity? My wife and I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!",1330473600,,1312,4.504201680672269

The film itself could very well be an M. Night vehicle.  By that I mean it's decent, not great; the script is a bit prohibitive but the story-telling is enjoyable, and there's one easy to predict plot twist that ultimately redeems what at times is a movie that drags along a little too slowly.

Jessica Chastain continues to impress as Shannon's long suffering wife who struggles to understand her husband's gradual decent into possible madness. While watching the film, I remembered Richard Chamberlain's lawyer in Peter Weir's film The Last Wave who also questioned his sanity while having visions of a coming apocalypse. Weir's film also does an excellent job of telegraphing impending doom but Michael Shannon's performance raises Take Shelter to another level of dread. Others have expressed some disappointment with the film's conclusion. Initially, I felt that the ending was a little too convenient but on reflection this feeling may have been caused due to the powerful buildup of images and emotions throughout the film. All this would probably diminish any denouement offered by the writer/director?

4990254,5,B006HGXGWU,"The simplicity of ""Take Shelter,"" Jeff Nichols' critically acclaimed 2011 art-house film, is its brilliance. From the opening scene, when a man stands alone and studies an approaching storm, there's a deep instinctive chord that rings like the chime of distant sirens. Storms kill, and nature's ominous fury can scatter humans like so many insects. The storm's pall covers the film through a series of dreams, and its producing a dark rain drenching the land in ""motor oil"" sludge. On a regular basis, we read about global warming and its effects upon our planet. We watch Werner Herzog's 2007 documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Encounters-at-the-End-of-the-World-Blu-ray/dp/B001DWNUDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Encounters at the End of the World [Blu-ray</a>], in which a population of isolated scientists working in the Antarctica respond unanimously without hesitation that its affects are increasing on a monthly basis. Hurricanes and tornadoes are more numerous than ever before, slamming New Orleans and Joplin, Missouri. Ancient ice is cracking for the first time in recorded history. Something terrifyingly dangerous is on the horizon and it's marching towards us.

The always interesting actor Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a modest Ohio family man who struggles to make ends meet. He wears a hardhat on the job as a contractor, sweating daily with machines that drill into the delicate earth to create trenches. He works alongside his best friend Dewart (Shea Whigham), brown-bagging lunch and having a beer afterwards at the local pub. In the morning, he has a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). Their daughter is deaf, and they discuss the difficult finances that might allow her corrective surgery. The vivid dreams continue with the world wracked by storms and an unseen menace attacking his home. We learn mental illness runs in his family and Curtis, in a beautifully subtle scene, pays a visit to his mother (Kathy Baker) who suffers from schizophrenia. Finding no comfortable answers, he checks in with the family doctor and tries to explain his terrifying visions. Curtis cannot overcome a deep, growing dread of approaching danger, and he is soon constructing elaborate additions to the backyard tornado shelter.

""Take Shelter"" is one of those rare films where one is never sure what is going to happen next. There is suspense, but the drama's driving force is Curtis' attempts to remain calm when terror is just beneath his panicked surface. Every fiber of his being is telling him to take shelter with his family, and he jeopardizes a good life to do just that. We're never sure if the visions are valid or if Curtis is suffering an extraordinary mental breakdown, but his irrational behavior soon alienates friends and neighbors.

There is no convenient category to place ""Take Shelter"" into, though one could call it a quiet version of M. Night Shyamalan's underrated 2008 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001HOZWUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>. This is also a darker version of Phil Alden Robinson's whimsical 1989 work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Field-of-Dreams-Blu-ray/dp/B001YV504U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Field of Dreams [Blu-ray</a>], in which a farmer (Kevin Costner) hears voices and risks his family and career to build a baseball field. But Costner's character was hearing a voice of God, while Shannon's Curtis is possessed by hellish visions of approaching doom. There's a small thread connecting these films in that, the undeniable strength of respectful love holds a couple together no matter the chaos. Chastain's Samantha (in an equally strong performance) is horrified by her husband's behavior, but chooses to stand by him because she knows the goodness within. Together they bore a child and life, and she's not going to give it up easily. With growing unease she takes the helm, making plans to overcome his choices that have risked their financial future.

""Take Shelter"" is a disturbingly subtle document of modern times, when the fear of environmental catastrophe, financial recession and the destruction of America's working middle class looms over the land. Curtis' difficult attempts to find proper health care and financing for his daughter's surgery is another stressor having great relevance. It's no wonder all of us don't have breakdowns, looking for protective shelter to ride out a tsunami which may end American society as we know it. Curtis is crumbling from the pressure, but Samantha refuses to allow him to succumb, and together they nod in agreement to face the coming storm.

With a few thought provoking moments, what Nichols' incredible work has done is provide profound inspiration to every family struggling to survive. ""Take Shelter"" is a film for adults wrought with the humble responsibilities of raising a family, who have avoided by necessity the numbing drugs of 24-hour technological consumerism. Lyrical and haunting, it is a classic statement of the 21st century.",1330128000,7,5203,5.65685019206146

Acting but with that cast it's hard to go wrong.
Somewhat well directed and written storyline of a man who appears to have either inherited a delusional, almost paranoid, mental illness or that he has a gift (from whatever source) to foresee an upcoming tragic weather related event.
Overall a nice flow of building tension as the viewer is torn between choosing the illness or the supernatural explanation.

Negatives:
Story had it's plodding predicable stretches especially within a two hour, mostly singular location, movie.
Low budget CGI of crows, tidal wave and funnels over ocean was a bit disappointing. Seemed to cheapen the movie.
Ambiguous endings in movies are too often a result of writers enamored with their own cleverness. Since it's their story that a viewer has watched for 119 minutes and not the viewer's story they should finish the final minute of their story. Every beginning in life has a ending unless you're into infinite parallel alternative universes.",1329868800,,990,5.149068322981367
4990259,5,B006HGXGWU,"Atmospheric tale.

Curtis is a solid hardworking husband and father who is suddenly having frightening realistic dreams of destruction, mayhem and seeming doom - always preceded by various forms of water or viscous substances.

Like his mother, a paranoid schizophrenic, is he also losing his grip on reality? Are his dreams and visions intersecting with fears about himself or it is a portent of something more ominous?

This production presents us with a stark and plain realism. There aren't any beautiful people, no cute women and handsome men - everyone and everything is average. A true slice of life set on a gray, but beautifully simple stage. I was impressed by all the artists who performed their roles to perfection; but in particular, engaging lead actor Michael Shannon who completely envelops the ulcerating madness of a man on the edge.

In my view, Director Jeff Nichols cleverly took the Story of Noah and repackaged it to and for a modern audience. It's almost a literal translation as I understand the tale. Most interestingly though - Curtis is guided to go underground, not float above it. And the most terrifying aspect of that: If Noah was granted a vision of a great flood of water covering the Earth, and Curtis sees monstrous storms - all things being equal - what kind of storm would the world be facing?

Yikes.

Quiet edged production that sounds like a razor moving across a mirror - an almost imperceptible tone that's the harbinger of undefined and terrifying danger.

Very remniscent of films like 'Frailty' and 'Knowing'.",1329782400,3,1555,4.934865900383142

Is one crazy for being prepared for what might come, no, but one thing is for certain, it's not going to do you any good, if your miles away from where you are prepared for a desater. If the end of the world does come, do you really want to be the last one standing. Who are you gong to tell, I told so, talk about a lost moment.

It is a little slow, but it did keep me interested, which isn't easy with all of the slow moving train wrecks they put out any more. The train don't have to cost a lot of money, it just has to go somewhere, and you have to be able to stay on it. Bad acting, bad writng, bad story are all like bumps on the track, to many bumps and and I'm not staying on the train.

4990268,4,B006HGXGWU,"I would not have watched this movie had it not been for the positive reviews here on Amazon.com, but I'm glad I did.

The acting really was superb, as Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain do a great job of showing us the slow unraveling of a typical family and their interactions with one another. Their emotion is, for the most part, understated (except for a few very emotional scenes by Chastain as the wife), which is what makes the film so interesting to watch. You can see the internal conflicts deepen in Shannon through his facial expressions, not in explosions of behavior.

What I like most is that the family decides to deal with what they think is psychotic behavior on the father's part, in a very loving manner. They stick together to try to make things work even though it seems at times that the father is totally off his rocker.

I was okay that the ending is not very climactic because it was resolved in the same way as the rest of the film - with an understated sense of urgency and doom.

This movie could have easily gotten religious or just plain stupid, but it did neither of these. The director kept the movie visually appealing while developing the characters just enough to create a slow burn of tension and interest. Though I've read some reviews that imply the daughter, who is deaf, is a symbol of the community, which refuses to believe the father's visions, I took her to be more of an extension of the father's character. He seems ""normal"" in most regards, but his dreams and ensuing behavior lead him to be an outcast in many ways. And he, like the daughter, has a chance to be more ""normal"" (she through surgery and he through medication) but aren't able to take that route.

4990278,4,B006HGXGWU,"It's difficult to know if ""Take Shelter"" was intended as thriller or psychological drama. The climax is not its strongest feature, but it does generate suspense. Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and 6-year-old daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf. Curtis works for a sand-mining company, while Samantha stays home with their daughter and sells her handiworks at a flea market on weekends. This affords them a modest home with a big yard and view of the countryside. But Curtis has begun to have disturbing dreams. They always involve a big storm, followed by violence. He becomes preoccupied with refurbishing an old tornado shelter in his back yard. Then he begins to hear and see storms that aren't there while awake. Curtis wonders if he is showing signs of the schizophrenia that afflicted his mother, or having premonitions of an impending disaster.

Jeff Nichols wrote and directed ""Take Shelter"", inspired by a sense of global anxiety, unease about the future, engendered by the financial crisis. Curtis LaForche is an introverted man of few words who feels strongly the need to protect his family -but from what he is not certain. Michael Shannon does a nice job of showing us Curtis' inner torment, created by his conflicting compulsions to build the storm shelter, to hide his troubles from those around him, and to find out if he might be mentally ill. Wife Samantha is as understanding as she can be and impressively sane once she understands her husband's fears. I admire the complexity and integrity of those two characters.

4990280,4,B006HGXGWU,"Curtis is a layman who lives in the Midwest with his wife and child.  Like many Midwestern family men, he has a fear of storms.  Except his fear is sudden and decidedly acute.  Curtis begins having vivid dreams of an approaching storm, and strange rains that drive people mad.  His nightmares become waking visions, and he begins to invest--at his family's expense--in the tornado shelter in the backyard.  Just in case.

Michael Shannon, as Curtis, gives a stellar performance.  At times hauntingly poignant, at others frustratingly off-putting--his meltdown is a stunner--he holds your attention to the screen and never lets it go, even when the film meanders.  Jessica Chastain, as Curtis's wife Samantha, is forced to play second fiddle, but it's still another great 2011 performance for her (even if you hated it, and I'm not taking sides here, you have to admit that Chastain was fantastic in Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE).  Even the supporting parts--Tova Stewart as Curtis's daughter, Shea Whigham as his friend/coworker--are ably cast, and the acting here is one of the film's great strengths.  Another is the visual effects, which are utterly captivating; there are a few scenes--Samantha in the kitchen, the birds, all the stellar storm imagery--that are worth the price of admission alone, in addition to the film's other strengths.

Jeff Nichols's direction is solid and assured.  This is, at its most basic, a horror film, but you never truly feel it.  Nichols doesn't go for the cliched ""shock"" factor (which ultimately weakens the film's conclusion, but that's for those of you who've seen it already), instead letting the horror of his story sink in naturally.  This is TAKE SHELTER'S most redeeming factor, but it comes with a price: when a film revolves around the ""is he/isn't he"" question, audiences demand an answer.  At 2 hours, TAKE SHELTER stretches the wait until it's breaking point.  There's a lot of build-up, so much so that the final answer seems not worth the while.  Granted, Nichols's point is that the ""twist"" is irrelevant: this is a character study, about a man and his family suffering what is (for all intents and purposes, be it true or not) mental illness.  But still, there's a bit of filler in this film, and that keeps it from being everything it could be.  Still, if you like solid filmmaking and fantastic performances, TAKING SHELTER is definitely worth your time.",1329177600,,2413,4.9875
4990281,5,B006HGXGWU,"Every year, there are a handful of films that enter and leave theaters very quietly, then pop up out of nowhere to appear all over critics' year-end lists. Take Shelter premiered last year at Sundance and ran the festival circuit, picking up a handful of awards along the way, before opening in limited release back in September. Though it failed to make enough money to recoup its already modest $5 million budget, critics raved about the film and its central performance by Michael Shannon. Shannon plays Curtis LaForche, an Ohio family man who begins dreaming about an apocalyptic storm. Deciding at first to keep the dreams to himself, Curtis pours all of his energy into building a storm shelter in his back yard; his obsession with the shelter eventually strains all the meaningful relationships in his life. A piece of subtle, nuanced filmmaking, I feel Michael Shannon's performance alone made the film worth seeing, but the film itself is a perfect blend of drama and dread. It's a slow-burn psychological mindbender that builds tension gradually, so it's not for everyone, but you can be sure you'll be witnessing some top notch filmmaking if you watch it.",1329177600,10,1166,4.954081632653061

4990283,4,B006HGXGWU,"There is a lot of food for thought in this movie.  In prior times, a man like Curtis would not be assumed to be mentally ill.  The fact that he is having visions would be respected by both the bible and in native folk lore as he would be seen as a possible prophet in their midst.  Curtis's mother has been in long time care since she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic.  However, when we meet her, the question is really open as to her as well.  We live in an age where science has decreed that things like portents, omens, seers, prophets and the like are impossible.  That anyone who deals in this matter is just plain loco.

Curtis begins turning his storm shelter into more of an atomic bomb like shelter and runs into one person after another who is teed off at him, from his employer to his colleague to his wife.  Yet he persists.  What he sees is supported by reports which have been filed around catastrophes. For example, when tidal waves come in, birds do go crazy.  They swarm and take off and some, in their hurry to get out, drop dead from the sky to the ground.

So the big question is whether Curtis is having a psychotic break with reality or if he is a seer who feels and sees a disaster coming.  I know most people are going with the mental illness interpretation.  Personally, I think since this this kind of person has been chronicled for thousands of years that it is possible that such a person could exist but does not want to broadcast his visions for precisely the reason that people will think he is insane.

Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife are both terrific.

4990288,5,B006HGXGWU,"Is Curtis LaForche having a futuristic vision, or is he in the early stages of schizophrenia?

That's the question that we keep asking ourselves as we watch TAKE SHELTER, writer-director Jeff Nichols' tense psychological thriller that features an astounding performance by Michael Shannon as Curtis, as well as stellar dramatic turns by the rest of the fine cast.

Construction worker Curtis LaForche (Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and their six-year-old, hearing impaired daughter (Tova Stewart).  When Curtis begins having nightmares and hallucinations of a coming apocalyptic storm, he not only builds an expensive storm shelter in his back yard, much to the concern of his family, friends and employer, who eventually fires him, but he also begins to doubt his own sanity, since he mother had fallen victim to schizophrenia years before.

Nichols endows his story with a deliberate pace that allows viewers to take the journey with Curtis as, on the one hand, he succumbs to his unnerving ""visions"" by building the expanded storm shelter while, on the other, exploring the looming possibility that he is, indeed, losing his sanity like his mother (Kathy Baker) did when she was his age.

At times, the slow pacing works against the film, which would probably have been more effective than it is already, were it trimmed by twenty minutes.

I don't care how ""great"" an individual scene or moment might be.  If the information it conveys is redundant and it slows the overall tempo of the film, then it should go.  That's why ""God"" created ""Deleted Scenes"" sections on DVDs.

Nevertheless, TAKE SHELTER is a fine film with an ending that will definitely have viewers pondering long after the picture has ended.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains informative and interesting audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols and star Michael Shannon.

There are also two deleted scenes, a 10-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette and a 20-minute Q&A with Shannon and co-star Shea Whigham.

'Take Shelter' is a part horror, part psychological drama starring the always excellent Michael Shannon, as an Ohio construction worker who has a history of mental illness in his family, and is now plagued by disturbing visions himself. The question arises whether these visions are portents of things to come or merely the hallucinations of a man gradually experiencing a complete mental breakdown. The entire film is dependent on the big 'payoff' at the end, which turns out to be intentionally ambiguous according to writer/director Jeff Nichols, and has sparked a great deal of controversy over the internet, as to how to interpret such an ambiguous denouement.

Nichols presents his story more as a parable than a drama about real life people. Most of the characters are referred to by first names only, such as Michael Shannon's 'Curtis' and his wife 'Samantha' (also well-played by Jessica Chastain). Curtis is sort of an everyman, distinguished only by the fact that his daughter, Hannah, is deaf, and that his mother is a schizophrenic, now living in an assisted living facility. Everyone in Nichols' rural Ohio community, seems to be overly grim and lacking any kind of sense of humor. What's more, there are few discussions by any of the characters that would ground them in any particular place and time.

A good part of the film is taken up with depicting all of the alarming visions Curtis is experiencing. The visions run the gamut from Curtis being attacked by his dog, zombie-like people attempting to break into his house and his car while he's driving with his daughter, as well as a giant flock of birds that seemingly hone in on Curtis as a target.

Curtis becomes convinced that the visions he experiences, are real, and as a result decides to build a shelter to protect his family from an oncoming apocalyptic storm. His co-worker buddy, Dewart, decides to help him as they borrow their company's heavy digging machinery without authorization and use it to construct the shelter. It's Dewart's devotion to Curtis that causes him to use poor judgment in allowing Curtis to use the machinery without permission. I found Dewart's capitulation to Curtis' request, still a bit too easy as of course such an action could place both their jobs in jeopardy. As it turns out, that's exactly what happens: Curtis is fired and Dewart is suspended for two weeks.

For those who were satisfied with the machinations of Nichols' grim characters for most of the film, I can only say that everyone's concept of suspense is different. My feeling was that by the end of the film, the payoff had to be pretty darn good, since the events leading up to it were markedly slow-going, a bit repetitious and not all that absorbing. Nevertheless, I will concede that the ambiguity of the film's ending is food for thought--although ultimately, not as profound as many would like to believe.

The film's ending can be interpreted in two distinct ways. The first interpretation is that Curtis' visions were real and his warnings to his community about an impending apocalypse, fell on deaf ears. The storm can be seen as the ultimate result of global warming, with Nichols criticizing those unconcerned about environmental disaster preparedness as well as a general critique on those who rely solely on rationalism as a guide through life. Ironically (with Interpretation #1), it's Samantha, Curtis' well-meaning, 'rational' wife, who gets the shock of her life when she looks out toward the horizon at the beach and sees the 'apocalypse' bearing down on her and her family. Some internet posters argue that since the storm is seen in the reflection of the beach house window (and not from Curtis' point of view which we had always seen before), this is proof that the storm is meant to be real. Interpretation #1 believers hold that when Curtis calls out to Sam at the end, and she responds, ""Ok"", that's her frozen in fear, acknowledging that she was wrong and Curtis was right all along.

Interpretation #2 holds that the climax is another one of Curtis' hallucinations, albeit more benign and optimistic than those that have come before. In this interpretation, the family wouldn't have taken this trip since Curtis had lost his job and they could not afford it (Interpretation #1 believers point out that Samantha had extra money stashed away and would have used it to make the trip, as part of Curtis' ongoing rehabilitation). When Sam says ""okay"", she's accepting Curtis' continuing mental illness but is glad that the family is still together. The final scene is in contrast to an earlier one of Curtis' hallucinations, where he perceives his wife as hostile, on the verge of grabbing a knife and perhaps attacking him. Instead of Curtis as doomed seer, he's merely a victim of mental illness, whose wife has made the commitment to stay and support him as he tries to recover.

I believe that writer/director Nichols threw in the 'Twilight Zone ending' (where Curtis' prophecy is realized), by directing Jessica Chastain to display a look of dread as she stares out at the impending storm. But overall, if one looks at the nature of Curtis' hallucinations (which include zombie-like creatures), I'm in the camp of Interpretation #2, which believes that Curtis is mentally ill.

Most of 'Take Shelter', with its generic characters and slow-moving plot, feels derivative. Only the clever, ambiguous ending, which has sparked endless discussion, is enough to save it from total mediocrity. Nonetheless, my feeling is that this probably could have worked better as a one hour, Twilight Zone-like episode, than a full-length feature.",1326499200,21,5673,4.969441517386723
