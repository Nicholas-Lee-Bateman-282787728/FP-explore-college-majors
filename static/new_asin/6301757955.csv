7814772,5,6301757955,"I remember seeing this video special back in 1990 or 91 or 92 when I was either in 5th, 6th, or 7th grade. Talk about a Wonderful Special because we need to recycle and I do recycle can's and bottles. To make this world a better place because this world is crazy with trash everywhere and people not recycling bottles or paper or cans and they should. I don't have a family yet and when I do I'll show my kids this Awesome Video about saving the planet to recycle things. I'm glad that I got this video because it brings back a lot of memories when I was a child watching this video in school. It also shows Harold Ramis from Ghostbusters 1 and 2 except he plays WasteBusters in this video. Harold Ramis R.I.P..",1423180800,,711,4.235294117647059

Sometimes when you get something that you remember as a kid it doesn't hold up to the memory, but this does.

great cast great message & great story",1392336000,,215,4.2439024390243905
7814775,5,6301757955,"It's a very interesting special with a variety of celebrities like Bette Midler, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Bill Cosby, Kevin Costner, Rodney Dangerfield, Morgan Freeman, Magic Johnson, Rick Moranis, Martin Short, Harold Ramis and Robin Williams... plus Bugs Bunny, ET, Kermit the Frog, etc... it's quite a star studded show with a message.  The premise is that Bette Midler is Mother Earth, and thanks to everyone polluting and ruining her (the Earth), she is sick and dying.  There were a lot of segments from TV shows current at the time including the casts of Cheers, The Golden Girls, Married... With Children, etc... plus cast members from medical, crime, and news shows.  There is humor, clever segments, moments to ponder, a rap song with Will Smith (among others) along with scenes showing how we are destroying the Earth followed by simple steps and solutions that everyone could do to help reduce the level of our negative impact on the Earth and ending with a haunting song by Barbara Streisand.
My version was a 20 year old VHS tape, which unfortunately didn't work, and so therefore I'd recommend either a DVD or Blu-Ray version if available. This is something worthwhile to show to kids/students at least on or near April 22nd every year.",1274227200,2,1300,4.981566820276497
7814776,5,6301757955,"I first saw this on TV twenty years ago and loved it then. I bought a video copy of it back then but it was stuck in storage when I wanted to use it for a class I was teaching. The video was excellent, held the kids attention when they started recognizing the stars, most of whom are still active. The message is meaningful and leads to great conversations about the work that is still needed. Recycling isn't enough, so many people do it and considered that the end of what is needed, the video tells about other issues. It was well produced and directed and is still viable in today's world.",1266624000,,593,4.303571428571429
