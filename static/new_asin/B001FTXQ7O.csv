8302699,5,B001FTXQ7O,Lots of easily explained options and workouts to get into basic yoga. Goes up to some intermediate poses. Very nice cool downs all within 15 minutes. English and Spanish options both available.,1407196800,,193,5.0625
8302700,5,B001FTXQ7O,"This yoga DVD is relaxing and well paced. It was used over summer school with teenage boys
who normally do not like ""yoga"". However, they got the hang of it and it was calming to
the staffs nerves and the students as well.
I recommend this series, it was FREE at one time from McDonalds as an incentive, but I
purchased them on line for a low price.
Worth the time and money...

8302701,4,B001FTXQ7O,I love this. I don't like the other ones but the Yoga is great. It's quick and it customises based on your mood.,1287705600,3,112,3.9130434782608696
