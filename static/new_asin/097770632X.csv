7795749,5,097770632X,"I was delighted to receive this cornucopia of items from Storytime Yogas creator Sydney Solis. After reading her bio, I can safely say that Ms. Solis has created a yoga program that is full of love, dedication and the amazing art of story telling!  She is truly one of the pioneers of the art form and I can hear her rallying cry of We can get kids moving using story telling, vivid imagery and movement. Without a doubt, Ms. Solis embraces educate the whole child!

The original Storytime Yoga Teaching Yoga to Children Through Story (Book) was one of the first books I ever bought as I began my own yoga journey. The book includes sample stories that are ancient tales brought to life with yoga movement and a moral. You can follow these examples, but I feel the main object of the book is to give the freedom to you to use your own stories, to find your own voice.
With The Treasure in Your Heart: Yoga Stories for Peaceful Children (Book), Ms. Solis passion for bringing the teaching of yoga into her lessons is in full swing. This book is very user friendly and very spiritual. The story of her life she shares at the beginning, is such an honest and open introduction to who she is, that you cannot be but pulled in. Her mission is clear to educate children in yoga through story by offering them tools for mental and physical health which she obviously embraces fully. This books includes a nice collection of photographs of children doing the yoga poses.

Peace, for the Children: Yoga, Story, Dance and Mantra Music for Children (CD) uses story, music and mantra. Through the telling of multicultural teaching tales, these story songs develop focus, inner peace and creativity. The rhythms, the repetition,the movements and the affirmations through mantra together are an all encompassing balance of body, mind and spirit. Some of my favorites were:
a. Breath It In= Cool and jazzy!
b. Om Mani Padme Hum=good giggle song and a good dance song. Make up moves for a repetitive sequence to create a moving meditation.
c. The Golden Fish=love the steel drum, island vibe.
d. The Skeltons Ball (especially the Spanish version, Chumba La Chumba) So much fun to sing along!
The Peddlers Dream: Yoga with a story about following your heart (DVD) The story is very nice and I love the connecting the yoga pose as they help you embody the lesson from the story. This also includes a lovely guided meditation for the end of the yoga lesson. It is very relaxing, especially for young children who are usually very squirmy.

This is a very accessible program, making it great for both practitioners and non-practitioners of yoga to use. Personally, I have found the teachings from the two books to be an invaluable addition to my own teachings. I have used the wisdom of the story teller in many situations. Thank you Ms. Solis! Deep gratitude! I highly recommend Storytime Yoga. Go forth and give yoga!

Thank you to the Sydney Solis for sending me this amazing bundle! All opinions are my own.",1500336000,,2991,4.678707224334601

7795751,2,097770632X,"Our 3-yr-old son watched intently during the story, but unfortunately the yoga aspect of the video was very disappointing.  I was hoping they would present the poses in a way that was easy for a child to learn them; on the contrary, they went through them so fast and held them for so short a period, that it was difficult for even adults to follow.  The re-creation of the story with yoga poses was a cute idea, but it was somewhat forced and did not ""flow"".  There are better options for stories and yoga (independent of each other).  For yoga, we liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Families-Connect-With-Your-Kids/dp/B001M9PBK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Families: Connect With Your Kids</a>&nbsp;much better.",1264896000,3,776,5.901785714285714
7795752,3,097770632X,"I think the story is beautiful first off, however, I don't feel there is enough yoga poses in the video.  My 4 and a half year old daughter will replay the pose review section that is available.  Even after the first time viewing it she said, 'that's it?'.... But she does enjoy the story and loves to sit there and listen.  I just wish there was more movement. More of a sit down story, but then again, even a little yoga is better than none!",1264636800,2,443,4.188235294117647
7795753,5,097770632X,"My daughter started doing this DVD at 3 1/2 years old. I did it with her for a couple of months and now she likes to do it by herself while I am cooking dinner. She also has all the Gaiam Kids Yoga DVDs but those never really resonated with her like this one has. She has been exposed to yoga since birth because I practice at home every day. She has been in Mom& baby and toddler/ little kids yoga classes since she was a baby so, yoga is not new to her, but I think this would engage any child even first time yogis! I would suggest to parents with children under 6 not to worry so much about form and alignment, just let the kids have fun with it and try not to correct or adjust them in their efforts as it can be off-putting for young kids (not like adults who love adjustments). It is better for them to just have fun with it now so they will establish a love of yoga that will develop as they do. I highly recommend this DVD for young children (up to around 8 or 9).
It begins with some lovely songs about breath awareness, moves to some warm ups and introduces sun salutes, then Sydney tells a very engaging story which my daughter LOVES, and then the kids act out the story with yoga poses. There is also a handy pose workshop type of option that you can do with your kids before the practice that explains each pose in greater detail. The savasana at the end is a beautiful guided meditation that is very appropriate for young children. It is the only savasana my daughter will actually do. She normally likes to squiggle and look around the room during savasana. After a few times of doing this one, she will actually lie quiet and listen to it. I am very pleased with this purchase and I have recommended this to several friends as well. Thanks Sydney! You're Awesome!",1259020800,3,1780,4.222873900293255
7795754,5,097770632X,My daughter is not yet three and yet I showed the DVD to her today and she cried to have it played two more times today.  She couldn't get enough.  I don't do yoga yet wish I had taken it up years ago and thus became motivated to expose my daughter at an early age.  I was washing dishes and watched her try all the poses.....of course she wasn't doing them perfectly even though they are simple but the fact that she was fascinated and was translating the information into her body was so cute to watch.  And it was a bonus that Spanish is also gently introduced.  And the message is profound yet simple enough for a child to digest.  Bravo!,1250294400,,642,4.221311475409836
7795755,4,097770632X,"I showed this to my 4 year olds, this past weekend, and it was a hit.  Sydney is awesome and it is so much more than just yoga.

My only reservation is that the time between poses can be a little short.  They moved through them quickly, so maybe more appropriate for children that have been doing yoga for a while.  I'm sure mine will adjust once they've seen it a few more times.",1245628800,4,380,4.094594594594595
7795756,5,097770632X,"My son is the high arousal type.  He craves movement, movement and more movement.  So you can imagine what it's like getting him to follow his bedtime routine.  Well, the Peddler's Dream has been the greatest addition to our routine.  He is only 4, so I do the yoga poses with him and replay sections of the DVD slowly to give him time to get each movement.  After Yoga, he is calm, confident and happy.",1228694400,5,403,4.32

7795758,5,097770632X,"What can i say? - My daughter absolutely LOVES the ""The Peddler's Dream"" DVD. It's loaded with fun, smart stuff for kids, and it's one of the few times you will feel happy that your child is in front of the television.

The yoga poses combined with the beautiful story keep her interest by keeping her involved with interactive fun! In this sad time of rising childhood obesity, I am happy to have found a component in keeping my daughter active and healthy.

Plus, I don't know about you, but I can't stand some of the ""educational"" shows out there that ""teach"" languages. Instead I'd much rather my child pick up some spanish and french from Lalita the Ladybug and Jean-Jacques the Pirate!!

You'll be very satisfied with this purchase.",1200528000,16,738,4.661538461538462
