1641829,4,B00005OSKE,"I finally managed to snag this with the Kung-Fu Mania 4 pack today, and having watched it from start to finish...I was impressed with Bruce Lee the Invincible for the simple fact that the only BRUCEploitation about this film are it's title and DVD cover. The movie itself, of course, had nothing to do with Bruce Lee(which in a way in itself is a plus because usually Bruce Li's flicks are an attempted portrayal of Lee or blatant imitation at worst)...but the story is unique, the choreography is on-point, and my man Bruce Li(while not the MAIN character of this flick) renders the best acting and martial arts performance I've seen since he starred in Chinese Connection II(honestly...compared to his other movies, I've never seen my boy throw down so fast...lol). But I DO have to agree with many of the others posts and add that the only reason I didn't go on and give the Invincible a 5 is the whole GORILLA scene. What was really goin' on and what was the director smokin'? I started to cover my eyes and FWD when I 1st heard mention in the flick of the 'big apes,' and when I saw that mess I cringed at how fake they looked and at the fact that the gorillas were knowin' shaolin. AAAAAAAAGH!!!Would've done better as an outtake. But I strongly recommend this movie nonetheless, particularly to the die hard fans of Bruce Li's Chinese Connection II(official sequel to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection) becuase like in CC2, he's being himself as opposed to trying to fill the Little Dragon's shoes. Compared to CC2, I rate the Invincible a STRONG SECOND.",1107475200,,1558,4.648550724637682
1641830,4,B00005OSKE,"A GIRL GETS KIDNAPPED AND BRUTALIZED AND IT'S UP TO SOME SHAOLIN WARRIORS TO BRING HER BACK. VERY FUN TO WATCH AND IT HAS SOME VERY VERY ENTERTAINING FIGHTS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BRUCEPLOITATION FLICKS. IT'S TOO BAD THAT BRUCE LI [WHO'S BILLED HERE AS HIS REAL NAME] DIDN'T DO MUCH IN THIS MOVIE. HE COULD'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS MOVIE IN TERMS OF THE FIGHTS. AND WHAT SHOCKS ME THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT THE VILLAIN IS ACTUALLY MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ANY OF THE HEROES! WHICH IS A RARITY IN MARTIAL ARTS FILMS. BUT ANYWAY, THIS IS A SUPRISINGLY GOOD MOVIE. ONLY STUPID THING ABOUT THE MOVIE IS THE SCENES IN WHICH THE GORILLAS DO KUNG FU. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A GREAT MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE THAT ANY FAN OF THE GENRE SHOULD ENJOY. YOU HAVE TO ADMIT ONE THING, THE DUBBING IS HILLARIOUS.",1070928000,2,809,4.328947368421052
1641831,3,B00005OSKE,"The only thing worse than a good martial arts student going bad, is a good martial arts student who goes bad, begs forgiveness from his Teacher, leaves for Malaysia to turn over a new leaf, and then becomes even more evil than before.  Cheung Li Kung is a disgrace to the Shaolin Temple, and Teacher finds out just how rotten his former pupil has become when one of his current students goes to Malaysia to help out his uncle and aunt and sends back a report.  Besides a report of Cheung's crime lord qualities, he tells Teacher that Cheung's men have just beaten up his uncle and aunt because they refused to let Cheung marry their beautiful daughter.  In many a martial arts film, the Teacher is reluctant to fight or cause trouble, but this Teacher is more than ready to come to Malaysia with his star pupil (Bruce Li) and give the heel what he has coming to him.  Before the kung fu cavalry arrive, though, the innocent young lady in question has been kidnapped and beaten rather viciously, and the first student is nursing the wounds he received during his less than completely successful rescue attempt.
Maybe you are wondering how Teacher can scout the area without being recognized.  Ah, it just so happens that he is a master of the famous Shaolin Disguise Technique - this gives him the completely human face of another man, which he can peel right off his head at the right moment to reveal his true identity.  I have to say Teacher is pretty cool; in his hands, a fan is a deadly weapon, but the guy does tend to let Bruce Li take care of most of the fighting.  Oddly enough, Bruce Li's character does not seem to be the lead character, as he basically plays second fiddle to both Cheung and Teacher.  The whole movie moves through the first hour at a good pace, with no serious problems to be found.  There is something about the sixty minute mark of Bruceploitation films, though, that really hurts the genre as a whole.  Suddenly, Bruce Li and Teacher find themselves having to fight gorillas - these aren't just any gorillas, mind you; these are gorillas who seem to have at least a basic knowledge of kung fu.  After this ridiculous episode ends, the movie does, to its credit, manage to stumble its way to a pretty good ending.
I really don't even need to point out the fact that this film doesn't have the first thing to do with the legendary Bruce Lee (even though you will usually see it titled Bruce Lee the Invincible).  Bruce Li is not my favorite Bruceploitation actor, as I just find his fighting style too rigid and unnatural for my tastes, but he does have some fans out there who have taken a liking to him.  The man just seems to have very little charisma to me, though; I've seen a couple of Bruce Li movies already, yet I spent a good part of this one trying to identify the character Bruce Li was playing.  Still, there are much worse Bruceploitation films than this, and fans of kung fu movies will surely find enough entertainment value in Bruce Li the Invincible to get some enjoyment out of watching it.",1065571200,5,3040,4.47377938517179
1641832,5,B00005OSKE,"This movie is basically the tale of how three good Shaolin Kung Fu Fighters extract revenge on a former good, now bad Shaolin Kung Fu Fighter.  The bad fighter is a renegade who was banished from some branch of the Shaolin Temple for plotting to gain The Throne... and attacking his fellow students, teacher, and master.  I could be a little more specific about the storyline but that would spoil the, if any at all, plot suspense that this movie has.
In this film you will see some great action, and a little bit of humour.  There are numerous fight scenes, and they all good.  You will see the good guys beat the crap out of small time punks, Malaysian bushman punks, gorillas, weird rifleman punks with strange masks, a mistress, and the main boss.  You will see the bad guys beat the crap out of old people with sticks, strike a woman in the face with a horsewhip repeatedly, and other stuff along those lines.
All in all this is one of the best Kung Fu flicks that I've ever seen.  The characters are good, the voices used for dubbing are funny, the action is always good and never boring, there are some funny moments in the movie, and the film is entertaining from start to finish.  This movie is in my top 3, and it's absolutley worth every penny of the $$$$.",1061596800,4,1267,4.388888888888889
1641833,5,B00005OSKE,"this was better than i expected the only part that killed the movie is the men in gorilla suits doing kung fu, overall its a cool kung fu movie.",1033776000,,144,4.0

1641835,1,B00005OSKE,"I imagine this movie was imported over to US markets during the peak of Bruce Lee hype.  I have trouble believing there was time where you could slap the name ""Bruce Lee"" on a movie title and expect the audience not to notice Bruce Lee is not actually in the movie.  The movie isn't about Bruce Lee.  None of the characters are named Bruce Lee.  If I had paid for this, I would have been exceedingly annoyed, since it was a Amazon Prime selection, I was only mildly annoyed.",1362614400,,474,4.292134831460674
1641836,5,B00005OSKE,We saw this movie many years ago on tv. My husband and I laughed so hard and we talked about it for years. Finally found out the title of the movie and found it here. We had to have it. I won't spoil it by telling you  the funniest part.,1353715200,,237,3.74
1641837,5,B00005OSKE,I bought this for a good friend of mine who is not computer savvy at all. He was telling me about this Bruce Lee movie that he really like but couldn't find it anywhere. He was really surprised that I was able to find it so easily. Then he was shocked when I told him the price. So it's been a great addition to his collection.,1273190400,,327,3.9696969696969697
1641838,1,B00005OSKE,"I purchased this DVD over at Walmart, probably mistake number one, but it was just a buck. They had a picture on the cover of Bruce Lee, but the film itself stars Bruce Li (who is NOT the same person). To use Bruce Lee's image to market this film is unethical at best.

Other than the gorilla fighting scene mentioned by other reviewers and a rather disturbing almost rape scene, the movie itself wasn't so horrible. But I watched it all the way to the end thinking maybe Bruce Lee has some bit extra part. But alas, no.

At least the original Little Shop of Horrors marketed with Jack Nicholson on the cover has Jack cast in a bit part (that of the dentist).",1217808000,,659,4.306451612903226
1641839,5,B00005OSKE,I love martial arts films and this one is pretty good. The fighting is pretty good for an old school fighting film. The film does have some strange laughable moments with them fighting dudes in gorilla suits. Some of the enemies look like kung fu film rejects. I enjoyed it and have watched it a number of times.,1208736000,,312,4.396551724137931
1641840,5,B00005OSKE,"Ho Chung Tao (aka Bruce Li) Delivers fast and extreme martial arts fight sequences in this movie. The director should not have included the ""Gorilla"" fight scene because it is too far fetched. However, Ho Chung Tao is without a doubt amazing with flying kicks and several grabbling holds that he learned from his teacher.

I would also recommend buying ""Iron Dragon Strikes Back"" starring Bruce Li-
I give Ho Chung Tao combined with the fight choreogaphy (minus the Gorillas) a five star rating.
Note: This movie would have only received 1 star had without Bruce Li-",1193097600,,566,4.835051546391752
1641841,4,B00005OSKE,"Another grand $1 digiview movie, thank you China. This Time Bruce Li, not to be confused with Bruce Lee, or Bruce Lea, but maybe Bruce Le hunts down a renegade Shaolin monk terrorizing a Malaysian town. There is fast fighting, bad dubbing, and splattering gorilla brains. Overall, a good time is had by all.",1184371200,,307,4.703703703703703
1641842,1,B00005OSKE,"I was shocked for th 1st time with Amazon product , since it's not the real Bruce lee movie & the quality of picture was too bad !!",1167955200,,131,3.7142857142857144
1641843,4,B00005OSKE,"Lots of kung-fu action, many recognizable faces (Bruce Li, plus just about everybody who starred in Kung Fu, the Invisible Fist), and even familiar dubbed voices (the same guy who dubbed for Bruce Li in Blind Fists of Bruce).

Aside from the sexploitation, ploddingly familiar plot elements, capitalization on just about every occasion to start a fight, and the advent of Malaysian bushmen--and even martial arts apes(!), the film packs plenty of extended fight scenes and decent kung-fu quips.

A shoe-in for at least two Kung-Fu Theater Awards: (1) Best Death-dealing Noogie Administered to a Gorilla, and (2) Best Death Scene by a Gorilla.  How the actors kept straight faces in the gorilla scenes is a testament to their severe physical,  mental and emotional training: these scenes had me almost rolling on the floor with laughter.",1116288000,,836,5.125
