5407978,1,B00AAZ9FKG,"Although it's fiction, this show seems to be the medieval successor to HBO's ""Rome"" series. Like that show it is chock full of gratuitous sex and nudity, graphic violence, rape, murder, incest, profanity, torture, child abuse and characters that are without appeal. It's a shame because there are some good actors here and occasional moments of drama, but it is buried in trash. I suppose it's the trash that gets ratings so that's why HBO made it. There's really no need for a porn version of ""Lord of the Rings."" A better program in this vein is ""The Borgias,"" which offers a much more balanced artistic treatment of the same types of themes.",1364428800,9,644,4.707964601769912

5407998,5,B00AAZ9FKG,"If you're a fan of George RR Martin`s A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it's helpful to consider the show and narrative as separate entities, as the books are of course so much richer in detail.
With that said, the HBO series is stellar! I resisted at first, mistakenly believing the show would be Lord of the Rings-esque (not that that's a bad thing for fantasy fans!), with the same old trope of good vs evil. GoT is complex, yet accessible. Most of the characters are neither completely ""good"" or ""bad"", with the exception of some deliciously evil villains that go way beyond the ""Snidely Whiplash"" types. Political intrigue, dysfunctional families, just the right amount of magic; seamlessly weaving multiple genres. Worth owning for multiple viewing.",1477008000,,752,4.929133858267717

5408058,5,B00AAZ9FKG,"Uh its GOT....how can you not love it.
The fact that it comes with the digital download makes it better so I can watch on my ipad as I work out (because I hate the gym and need a distraction when doing cardio).
I am not a fan generally of ""midevil"" or lord of the ring stuff, and I wasn't going to watch this show initially, but I love sean bean as an actor as well as the guy who plays the king (i can never remember his name but I loved him on a CBS show he used to be on).  So I was bored on a sunday night and checked it out, and fell in love by the end of the first episode.....haven't missed an episode since.
So many moving parts is the one thing that deters me in that there are so many characters and storylines within the show, but with that said its still amazing in its story telling and compelling at the same time. There are so many heart wrenching moments, and no one is safe from death in this series.  Just when you think ""oh they won't kill him/her....."", they do!!!!  Also the contrary, when you think ""oh that person is gonna die""....they somehow live :-/

This show is amazing for anyone who loves drama, intrigue, and stories of greed, lust, incest, and power thirst.",1445472000,,1189,4.134199134199134

5408060,4,B00AAZ9FKG,"Admittedly I came to this series late.
However I found a boxed set of all four of the first series reasonably cheaply and decided to see what the fuss was about.
First up:
The production values are very high. Great costumes and sets, and the necessary CGI for this fantasy setting and story are also very well done for the most part.
Acting is good too, but I suspect for many there will be too many characters to follow.
Sometimes the relationships and motivations can become very entangled, specially when you have direct bloodline sons, throw in more than a few bastards and then some daughters etc. and it can at times cause you to ponder just exactly what is driving each person.
Suffice to say the whole thing boils down to ""everybody wants to be the king of the seven regions"". (And they will do anything at all to achieve this position. Incest, murder, betrayal, deceit, backstabbing....you name it they will do it!)
That's basically it in a nutshell.
Now of course there are many, many objections and obstacles to the ambitions of each and every one of the claimants.

Next it must be said that this whole series is BLEAK, .....VERY .""bleak"".
It's dark, shadowy and cold for the most part and literally nothing ""happy"" or even mildly uplifting ever occurs.
People are always being murdered or killed most graphically, tortured in the most horrific ways, executed and beheaded, having bits of their bodies chopped off, dis-embowelled, raped, subjected to unwanted marriages, fed to animals, stabbed multiple times in the pregnant stomach, or otherwise dying extremely unpleasantly by falling victim to the resident wandering dead know as ""white-walkers""  .
Did I mention this was  ...bleak?

If you happen to notice any of the characters enjoying what just might be interpreted as a somewhat joyous moment,.. perhaps taking pride in the forthcoming birth of a child or just the beauty of their wife,  you can be absolutely sure that same person is almost immediately to be assassinated or dispatched in some truly horrendous manner.
There's plenty of sex and frontal nudity throughout, ....female for the most part but there is also the occasional fully naked man as well.
That's if they are not having their penis lopped off or leeches applied to that very same member!
Happy times indeed!
There's also a great deal of SERIOUS swearing too, ....if that's going to offend you. (Both the F and particularly the C word get a real workout!)

As has been mentioned in these reviews,  some pretty obvious similarities to ""Lord of the Rings"" become apparent.
(Thankfully that story contained some  brighter sequences that this does.)
Game of Thrones is probably nowhere near as good as LOTR, but for those who enjoy sweeping ""dynastic"" struggles punctuated by much graphic bloodletting, and vast battles with very vivid depictions of soldiers being sliced open and apart, as well as quite a bit of sexual activity, and are not ultimately depressed but the constant gloom and cheerless nature of the storylines, it can provide quiet interesting viewing.
What I mean to say is that this whole production is NOT for everyone.

Mine discs are Blu-Ray and very clear, but the sound still varies annoyingly.
Set it for comfortable speech level and without warning, some sound-effect or musical swell will assault your ears and perhaps damage your sensitive speakers.
I was forever adjusting the levels with the remote.
If you've read and ticked off the list of features above and you still think you might be able to view this without sinking into deep depression, then I'd say go ahead. Be aware that the characters are totally ruthless, and  exceptionally vicious for the most part.

I'm quite ""enjoying"" it , (if that's the word) but I do have to say that even back in those imaginary ""dark ages"" there must surely have been some times of spontaneous joy? The addition of something of this nature would give the viewer just a little break from the seemingly relentless death, murder and destruction.

5408065,3,B00AAZ9FKG,"The DVD's are fine but the format is a bit screwed up - if you watch the series episode by episode beware that the sequence is off.  They actually left out one of the series; but you won't be aware of it because there's nothing to indicate the mistake.  Gradually you'll notice that things are happening that don't seem to follow where you left off.  I only realized they actually left out an episode when I tried the preview feature and found that the preview wasn't  the episode that was playing.... kind of poor that they can't even get the episodes in order.  You can rectify it by going to the ""view all"" feature and skip until you get to the one you missed.  Still, you shouldn't have to go through all that.

5408090,1,B00AAZ9FKG,"This is review is for the blu-ray outer case design that holds the discs in place.  When it arrived, the blue plastic spindle that holds the discs inside the outer case was broken.  The bottom end of the spindle, the part that holds it in place, was shattered into tiny pieces of blue plastic.  The spindle now floats freely, rather than being secured to the center of the outer case.  This was the same situation for both outer cases, season 1 and season 2!  This is just a very poor design.  It's not Amazon's fault, its the fault of the manufacturer of the outer cases.  The spindle is made of very thin plastic and is prone to breaking.  Other titles that use this same case design also arrived broken.  Other designs exist which do not use the spindle to hold the discs in place, too bad this particular set uses the spindle cases.

5408203,1,B00AAZ9FKG,"Read all the books - they were fantastic.
HBO TV Series is pretty bad compared to the books. If you never read the books, then the TV series would be OK 3 star. But compared to the great stories and the rich and vivid characters in the book the TV version is between 1 to 2 stars. The casting selection is so terrible and the actors so bland and ho-hum that it has actually ruined my imagined characters in the books.

We actually stopped watching the TV series after 5 episodes because if was ruining it for my wife who is still on the 5th book. Really, Catelyn Stark is not a dried up old hag of a wife as the TV show casted; Tyrion Lannister also terribly cast - in the book he quick & shrewd and nasty at times, ugly of course but still the main hero that still very likable - on TV he is un interesting.
And Daenerys completely off - so disappointing.  TV sound quality is poor, and even the photography is drab and not vivid.

My recommendation - stay with the books and hope that there will be a high budget big screen version of the books!",1423785600,2,1047,4.147783251231527

5408215,5,B00AAZ9FKG,"We were originally only lent the first season so when this two season set became available we just had to have it. I've already reviewed season one so to avoid repetition and in the interest of brevity I'll reserve my comments to season two.

The second season of this astonishing epic fantasy sees the ever deepening rifts between the former kingdoms boil over into outright civil war; betrayal, duplicity and back-stabbing (both political and actual) are the order of the day. There is little by way of light relief in any of the narrative threads as the tale piles along at a break-neck pace with only the Jon Snow story arc being somewhat weak and meandering. This second season certainly lives up to the promise of the first; all of the characters from ghastly Joffrey, through treacherous Theon to the ever delightful Tyrion are developing depth as the series evolves making for an engrossing, satisfying and memorable experience. Like season one, we re-watched season two immediately - there's so much going on that a second viewing is essential to fully appreciate the complexity.

It is not possible to heap enough praise on HBO for Game of Thrones; the casting & locations are perfect while the production values and attention to detail are way beyond anything else currently on TV or in the cinema. Even the packaging is a thing of beauty. Simply marvellous.",1421452800,4,1369,4.871244635193133

Season 2:  03/31/2015

The Funko Pop Vinyls:
The paint job leaves a lot to be desired.  What is supposed to be dirt or ash smudges on Khaleesi's face just look like they misses some spots while painting the skin color.

Great deal!  You get the digital copy to watch on the go and the physical disc when you are at home for cheaper than buying the seasons individually.  If you want the toys, they are an added bonus.",1403740800,,693,4.560975609756097

5408272,2,B00AAZ9FKG,"Yes, we've all heard about it. The violence. The shocking amounts of sex and nudity. Blah, blah, blah... How does it really stack up? In my opinion, not very well. While the show is entertaining, in a way, it falls apart pretty quick.

Let me preface things by saying, yes, I have read all five of the novels in the series that are currently out. The books are nothing shy of incredible. The stories are balanced and I have to give credit to George RR Martin for being able to juggle all these characters and stories into one book series. That, in and of itself, is no small feat.

The characters in the show are pretty much as they are in the books, not a whole lot of differences overall. However the whole thing with Sir Loris and Renley Boratheon was a bit jarring since it really never came up in the novels. Was it suggested in the books? It's possible, but I really don't remember that happening. Also there are several characters missing from the whole story that are critical characters even though they are ""second line"" characters at best. Moon Boy, Patch Face, and Strong Belwas are all missing. There are a number of inconsistencies in the plot line of the show. The first big one was Catlin Stark's meeting with Tirion at the Inn in book one (season one).

I'm going to throw up the huge ((SPOILER ALERT)) signal here. Yes, Jeoffrey is a royal masterpiece of evil (literally). He is in the books and he's ten times worse in the TV series. In the second season he takes to torturing and maiming ladies-of-the-evening. It's downright sick and I think the point is a bit too-overdrawn in the TV series. In the third season he takes up murdering these same kinds of women with his crossbow just for fun. Now, don't twist my words here, but in the book he only killed cats with his crossbow. Either way, it's horrible, and it's used as a plot device to make you hate Joffrey. While it does work I find it a bit disturbing that in a television show such as this killing domesticated animals is looked upon as sacreligeous and disgusting but the same kid killing and maiming women is looked over as just a convenient plot device. It just seems a bit out of balance to me. You can take your fingers out of your ears now. ((END SPOILERS))

While I know it's a TV show and they're not going to go and be 100% accurate to the book the differences become more and more inconsistent and jarring as the show goes on. I've watched the first three seasons (this boxed set only contains the first two) so I thought it might be a good idea to mention it. As the seasons go it becomes more and more apparent that the show has a lot of content and the amount of time they are spending on it isn't nearly enough. It has been said that the series is planned to only on on for a total of seven seasons. Season four is currently debuting on HBO and that only takes us up through the end of the third book and through a bit of the fourth (though admittedly the fourth book is a pretty tedious read). With the release date for the sixth book nowhere in sight, and supposedly at least one more book after that remaining in the series, I'm becoming very wary that this series will devolve into speculative screen writing rather than getting the info from the original creator (Mr. Martin). As such my hopes for this show to be truly memorable are rather low.

The show is entertaining but only just so.",1399593600,4,3388,4.379968203497615

5408276,3,B00AAZ9FKG,"Purchased from another retailer.  These are very well done films; we have all three seasons released thus far...the acting is great as well. We truly applaud the film makers for overall outstanding work. The reason for the mediocre rating is that after Season 1, the films all veer sooo far from the books, it's nearly another story altogether.  I get that the books are massive and a lot has to be cut out to fit into the time frame but jeesh....also, there's 10X as much nudity, graphic sex and violence in the films as there were in the books and that's saying a lot. It's virtually pornography.  Too bad the creators and the author saw fit to glamorize this puerile filth and gore...it downgrades some incredible acting and good writing.  J.R.R. Tolkien did not have to resort to this type of rampant dirt  to write an iconic classic fantasy epic. Still, that rant said...we're so caught up in the story, it's like watching a train wreck.

If you are really a fan of game of thrones, it is simply a nifty thing to add to your collection. Even though the mud looks a little fake, the dolls are true to the characters, looking rugged and strong. The bluray discs come in a very official case, with pictures of characters and scenes from the show on the back panels.

The majority of the time I'll select a special feature, wait 10-15 seconds for loading, and then it tells me that that feature is on a different disc!

Funko Pop Figures:
I'm a huge fan of Funko Vinyl Pop Figures. I work at a comic book store and these three are unavailable to order for retail. These are extremely popular right now and ""Chase"" (variant) figures are pretty hard to find. I was very skeptical buying this set because the paint on the Funko Pop's are always a hit or miss.  I could not pass up the offer when it went on sale. The ones I received were in mint, and the paint was the best I have ever seen on Funko Pops.

5408314,4,B00AAZ9FKG,"My son wanted me to buy the GOT series.  We binged watched during the holidays.  It's a great show but the over the top gratuitous sex/nude scenes are getting ridiculous.  All the actors are great but Peter Dinklage steals the show.  The only reason I wanted to watch this series is because of Peter Dinklage.  They also need to hire more American actors.  American TV has no problem hiring British actors.  There are many American actors who can pull off the British accent.

I have to say that I can't believe that people have compared this to Lord of the Rings.  GRR Martin doesn't come close to Tolkien. I am entertained by the series and I am looking forward to season 3 but sometimes I roll my eyes at what he's doing with the writing.  Sometimes I think he's trying too hard.  The thing that everyone loved about Breaking Bad is that every single scene had meaning and was well thought out and not gratuitous.  With GOT, I find myself asking what was the purpose of that scene or that scene should have been cut short or cut out altogether.  I never once felt that way with Breaking Bad and I can't wait to binge watch the series.

I am debating if I am going to keep the Blue Ray discs or sell them though since we are able to watch Game of Thrones on demand whenever we want so I am not sure if we would ever watch the discs.  I wish the Funko Pop set would have been sold seperately from the discs.,1388620800,,549,4.0

My <1 year old Sony Blu Ray player played the discs about half the time, with a very slow loading time between all disc functions.  The other 50% of the time the discs caused complete crashes or freezes of the player, requiring the unit to be physically unplugged before it could be restarted and the disc ejected.

5408378,5,B00AAZ9FKG,"Game of Thrones - Season 1 & 2.
I was a latecomer to the series, and was introduced to Game of Thrones by my daughter as a `must see'. I loved Season 1 but Season 2 is far superior and gets better the farther in you go - time just flies while viewing the unfinished collection of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin. Set in lands which could be England and Europe, in medieval days, one could almost see the parallel stories of the Wars of the Roses being enacted.
The pacing of the story is good, often deceptive and unpredictable, conjured up by introducing new characters in Season 2 after the foundation of the story has already been set up in Season 1. Acting is pretty much what you'd expect from some key players and the locations are stunning, ranging from Dubrovnik to Northern Ireland and Morocco, and settings ranging from craggy, arid deserts, warm Mediterranean climes to sweeping grasslands, icy tundra and freezing forests.
One word of warning - each disc has an age limit from 15 -18 years and most are rated 18 (adult). There is plenty of nudity, profanities and some rather exploitive sexual violence. This is NOT for the younger viewer. But if you're adult and love a good epic tale of medieval-fantasy-political-soap-opera-drama then this is definitely for you!
