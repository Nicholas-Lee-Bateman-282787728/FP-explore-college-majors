7852261,1,6303577059,"This production is labelled by its fabricators as an intentional reflection upon the highly successful 1989 film DEAD POETS SOCIETY, and several sequences are baldly copied after the original, but its narrative is quite thin, while its principal actors lack the requisite enticement required to approach the finesse of its purported model.  As a professor of history and rugby coach at imaginary St. Cyr College in north Texas, John Bull (Jason Bostwick) has transliterated his taste for studying military strategies utilized by Napoleon Bonaparte and his generals to the athletic field where his personal adherence to the principles of honour and discipline have helped in bringing many victories for his rugby teams engaged in college league competition.  Additionally, Bull has begun a romantic relationship with the newest member of the St. Cyr. faculty, professor of chemistry Victoria Bennett (Rebecca Gray), whose youthful spirit has patently improved staid John's emotional life, although it is somewhat difficult for a viewer to know this because of Bostwick's stiff execution of his part.  John stores a good deal of distaste within him for a former teammate from his own rugby playing days, Nick Raider (Allen Arkus) whose competitiveness turns upon a doctrine of winning no matter the cost, therewith directly opposed to that of highly ethical Bull, from whom Raider had purloined his fickle girl friend, later marrying her.  Raider contrives to arrange for a scrimmage between a professional club that he coaches and John's St. Cyr squad whose playing captain, Michael (Leon Slaughter), through his acceptance of Raider's challenge believes that he and his team will be defending Bull's honour, while the pro coach has in mind an assault upon his old foe's reputation.  As must be expected, the professionals outplay St Cyr's youths, a contest marred by Michael's death from a broken neck, a result of an intentional foul delivered during the scrimmage and Bull's good name is sullied as a result of the incident.  He is generally condemned for the tragedy, and soon after Michael's demise Bull finds himself largely devoid of students since eighty of them withdraw from his class.  In addition to this, he is informed by the college dean that his services will not be required beyond the current semester, and Veronica ends their affair as she also believes that he is responsible for the death of Michael, who was a physical analogue for her own late brother.  In the face of all of this, John challenges Raider to a duel in the traditional manner, using as weapons black powder flintlock pistols!  An obviously minimal budget will excuse many weaknesses revealed within a production, but not to the extent of those in evidence from this clumsily constructed work that lacks a consistent point of view, instead being an attempt to combine romantic melodrama and a sporting flavoured tale, providing only an unattractive narrative that is woefully short of sequences that might interest a viewer.  There would seem to be an insufficiency of coherent insight behind a disarranged script that reeks of triteness.  Bostwick and Arkus offer Johnny One-Note performances.  Most of the cast and crew are Texans, with many of the players having primarily stunt experience.  Gray does her best with the clich&eacute;d lines furnished to her. Post-production editing is weakly accomplished, and a blaring, often nonsensical, score frequently overrides mumbled delivery from players.  A number of camera compositions are quite creative, but this cannot compensate for what is essentially a disconnected work, presenting little of which those involved might be proud.  Similarly, there are several rather brief yet interesting rugby action scenes that are too few to allay the muddled monotony of the storyline.",1190764800,,3814,5.260296540362439
7852262,5,6303577059,"I was impressed with this movie. I never thought an independent film's story and plot could be as good as this. A Matter of Honor is amazing.

Glenn Pena's performance is unforgettable, his expressions and commitmet to his character show an amazing thespian-type mastery. Glenn Pena will go down in my books as a great actor, old school actor.",1144281600,3,343,4.813559322033898
7852263,5,6303577059,"I found this independent film surprisingly interesting and very good. The writer used a college rugby team as a backdrop for a story of honor and redemption.

John Bull is a professor of Napoleonic History and the college of St. Cyr's rugby coach. When his old college nemesus returns to campus a series of events are set in place which end up changing not only his life but the lives of his rugby players.

The story cleverly parallels Bull's lectures which outline many of the trials experienced by Napoleon's army as it force marched into Russia in 1812.

If you have a son... I would buy this film and discuss the various aspects of sports, college, male/female relationships... and personal honor... which are portrayed in this fine movie.",1116460800,2,744,4.796875
7852264,3,6303577059,"This film has Captain Marvel (Jackson Bostwick) as the professor/rugby coach doing a believable job.  Some of the dialogue is very over the top by Writer/Producer Craig Cosgray and the lead female should get another career..others in the cast do good jobs..cinematography and most of the director's work is very good, hindered by lead female and dialogue...some of the songs suck bad but the composed score is excellent by Kris Carter who writes for Batman and Beyond and several other tv shows and films (see imdb). All in all I think the Director Fred Watkins did the best he could with what he was given by the Writer/Producer. Couple of nice rugby action shots..",1094860800,,666,4.842105263157895
7852265,1,6303577059,"Forget about Plan 9 From Outer Space, Fred Watkins torpiddrama, A Matter of Honor takes the award as worst film of all time. This turkey is so slow it creeps along even in fast foward.  Nothing more than a vanity piece by producer Craig Cosgray.  Even TV's SHAZAM can't save this...  END",956016000,,287,4.480769230769231
