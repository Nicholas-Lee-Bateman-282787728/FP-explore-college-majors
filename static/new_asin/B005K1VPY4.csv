4714153,4,B005K1VPY4,"Jason Priestley directs this good enough, Christmastime, romantic comedy.  It's pretty much by the numbers but it is amusing and the actors make up for the weak and at times, non-sensical, plot- such is the genre.

Amy Acker plays a shopaholic, aimless, daffy, young woman whose rich mother gives her the ultimatum: get responsible, i.e., find a man, find a job, or else she'll cut her off, money-wise.  By magical chance, she finds a letter to Santa from a young girl who wants a wife for her dedicated and loving father(Haydn-Jones).

The remaining story involves the heroine pursuing him, competing with his not-really-meant-for-him girlfriend, learning compassion while working at a homeless shelter and bonding with the daughter.

What makes this story at all worthwhile are the character interactions; especially, the young actor(Emma Duke) who portrays the daughter.  She's terrific!  The comedy's mildly amusing; there's a lot of cattiness between the women which some might find entertaining(my wife thinks showing fighting over a man promotes the wrong ideas for women.  Hmmm, I'll have to think about that.  No, no, of course, she's right!)

It's a clean holiday, family friendly story.  I'd give 3-3 1/2 stars, 4 stars for the warm, moving scenes with the daughter.  For me, characterization is always more important than plot, budget, special effects, etc.  Give me interesting people.",1320278400,27,1398,5.271493212669683

4714159,2,B005K1VPY4,"Found it so juvenile. Don't mean to be a scrooge, it was okay, had seen it before and clicked on it now for a Hallmark channel movie without remembering the film. I just have a limit when it comes to dimwitted, mosquito-leg skinny, full grown women who talk like 2 year old children and act younger than any 12 year old I've met. This woman is about as far from living in the real world as it gets, even I've met others who are superficial living off their parent's credit cards (and her with a range rover) but even so, I have never in my life met such a brainless, ootsy cutesy woman in 6 decades of living. I sometimes feel this is a plot to 'dumb down' women in the extreme; imagine your child aspiring to be her. And there's this myth that a man wants a woman like this, a girly girl in a woman's body. In my experience, not for long. There's no substance to share a life with in someone like this; no substantial man can stay interested in this; he already has a daughter even. Not a film I could take seeing twice; her oochy coochy coo baby voice just grates on my nerves.",1513382400,,1079,4.167464114832536

Unlike a lot of other Christmas movies, this one does not focus on the commercialization of the holiday.  Some of the character's motive are somewhat selfish at times, but that is not the focus of the movie.  It is very refreshing to watch a movie with an  uplifting, positive theme.

Reading the posts, I 'm a little sad.  This, for all intents and purposes, it is a Canadian film.  It was filmed in Canada and most of the actors are Canadian.  They throw in a few US mail boxes and fly the US flag but you can't help but notice Canadian.  I'm from Toronto.  I visited Calgary a few times on business.  So it was easy to spot the landmarks.  Even easier when they're filmed in Toronto.  A lot of these movies, especially Hallmark, are filmed in Canada pretending to be US.  And a lot of the actors are Canadian. And that brings me to this.  It's easy for Canadians, Anglophone or Francophone, to view US movies.  It isn't easy for Americans to view Canadian movies.  Show any link to Canada, the Americans run for the hills.  Why is that?

My American wife often looks over to me when viewing and will ask, ""Is this in Canada?""  Yep.",1447545600,,1077,4.316582914572864

4714270,5,B005K1VPY4,"Amy is a true gem and really carries the film. The other actors do give good supporting roles. It's amazing how she is portrays so lovable here ( probably so true in real life after seeing some of her interviews ) while also being such a bad ass in Person of Interest.  Ok, I have been a great fan ever since seeing her in Angel as the displaced genius is saved by Angel.  Dear Santa has such a warm storyline and Amy's character is tested while trying to fulfill a promise and doing good.  After all, it is a Lifetime xmas story!  No spoilers here except to say it was a very satisfying ending.  The DVD does have the making of this film which I always love seeing.  I only wish that some Lifetime movies that are really popular go to blu-ray instead of regular DVD quality.  Sadly, Lifetime doesn't think that way as of yet but maybe a mention here and there will change their minds.",1435276800,2,885,4.263473053892215

4714272,5,B005K1VPY4,"In this sweet Christmas movie, and in a windy moment, fate allows Olivia's letter to Santa to escape the mailman's clutches and land right in front of Chrystal's face. Olivia's Christmas wish is for a wife for her dad, someone who can make him smile again (since his wife died). So, Chrystal decides to check out dad from the address on the letter. Chrystal stops in the soup kitchen that dad/Derek runs and winds up helping. As she gets to know Derek and Olivia, the plot thickens and also provides a sensitivity toward the hungry and homeless.

This is a really cute little movie in the backdrop of Christmas and the needs and humanity of those less fortunate. About 93 minutes of a feel-good movie you will want to watch anytime throughout the year. Amy Acker is Chrystal (aka Root on Person of Interest ). David Haydn-Jones is Derek, and bright-eyed Emma Duke is Olivia.",1434326400,,874,4.638709677419355

Her sole purpose in life is to shop courtesy of her wealthy parents and hang out at parties.  She discovers there is more in life and has the good sense to turn her life around.  You did not look up to her as a character, but she was likable.

4714302,4,B005K1VPY4,"This is a good romantic Christmas movie.  It is formulaic; most of them are.  You can predict that the two main characters will get together in the end and (undoubtedly) live happily ever after.  That almost always happens.
  It's the journey to that predictable ending that I enjoy in these kinds of movies and this one is no exception.
  The heroine of the movie is a little bit ditzy, never been able to stand on her own two feet without help (money -- you can see that she doesn't get a lot of good advice from Mom), but who has heart and is basically a decent person.  She's not perfect, but she's not afraid to try, to take a chance, to try to help in ways that she understands.
  I thought the acting was fine, the various occupations were new -- I've never seen a movie in which the one character drives a snowplow -- and overall is a very nice, pleasant romance.
  I liked the contrast in the two lifestyles of the main characters:  she rich & spoiled, not really in touch with the world around her, and he down to earth, hard-working and a little bit desperate.  She has a lot to learn but learn she does.",1419638400,3,1115,4.2727272727272725

She happens on a letter to Santa written by a girl who wants a new mom.  So she steals Santa's mail and follows the return address on the letter (even though there is clearly no return address on the letter) to stalk the dad--ooh, he's cute, yay!  Then she proceeds to fight with another woman over the man (and she's a better shopper, 'cause she has more money, so take that Jillian!) and wins, because her family's rich and she can save the soup kitchen!  Yay!  Also, she has super good mom potential because she can teach the little girl to be mean back to the mean girls, and take her shopping, so she can grow up to be a privileged, shallow twit just like her new mom.  Yay!  Nutshell:  teach your girls to fight over guys, always look stylish, especially when you're helping those poor homeless folks, and learn that the people with the most money always win.

Amy Acker (Crystal) is an absolute angel is this movie with eyes that will stop you in your tracks and a smile that melts your heart. Olivia is wonderful and makes you feel like she is truly falling in love with Crystal wanting her to be her new mom. Derrick is also terrific. He genuinely makes you believe he is falling in love with Chrystal. It certainly is one of my top 3 romantic movies of all time. Right there with ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've got mail."" I've already ordered this on DVD as it will definately become part of my yearly Christmas movie line-up. I wish they would have a follow-up movie.

But, for what ever reason, those who made this film, (which is obviously a Christmas time film aimed at families with children),decided to toss in one God-dishonoring profane phrase in one, and only one, scene. Why?????  I hope this film is not just the first of a new wave of cute ""Christmas time family movies"" that are ruined by the entirely unnecessary use of hard profanity in Christmas movies!",1340841600,9,536,4.680851063829787
4714394,4,B005K1VPY4,"Sentimental, cheesy, predictable, yeah... but also pretty wonderful. Of the deluge of Christmas films that shower us during the holiday season, DEAR SANTA manages not to be too cloying or excessively silly. Having seen Amy Acker only as the shy, studious Fred in ANGEL, it's a bit jarring to eyeball her as she takes on a frivolous character like Crystal. Except that there's this innate likability about Amy Acker, and a captivating quirkiness. She's lovely but unprepossessing. She's smart but she doesn't flaunt it. Even playing a spoiled socialite, she exudes warmth.

Threatened to get cut off by her wealthy parents, Crystal, a 30-year-old, irresponsible, incurable shopaholic, has until Christmas to demonstrate that she's gotten her act together, that she could be productive or at least settle down with a good man. When a fortuitous gust floats a stray ""Dear Santa"" letter in her direction, she sees her prospects opening up. The letter is from earnest seven-year-old Olivia (Emma Duke) who asks Santa for a new wife for her widowed dad Derek (David Haydn-Jones). You have to credit Acker at this stage. A different actress could've come off as horrifyingly mercenary here. But there's a sweetness to Acker.

In ensuing segments, Crystal - and, honestly, there's no more applicable verb - stalks Derek and Olivia, and she's encouraged by what she sees. Trailing Derek into a local soup kitchen, she inadvertently bumps into him and is promptly recruited to bread duty at the food service line. She learns that not only is Derek raising a daughter by himself and running a snow plowing business, he also operates the struggling soup kitchen, the legacy of his dead wife and a project that Derek had sworn to keep solvent. You can't fault Crystal for falling for him. It helps that she gets along really well with young Olivia.

DEAR SANTA benefits from a cast that performs with restraint. The characters' interactions are believable, with Acker effortlessly anchoring the whole thing. She inhabits her role, overcoming what could readily have been a clichd character. Crystal, once you get past the opening minutes and the shallow rich girl stereotype, comes across as a living, breathing, good-hearted person. A self-assured Jason Priestley (yes, that Jason Priestley) directs the film and avoids wandering into over-the-top territory. The kid, Emma Duke, is very good and doesn't try to be cute or precocious. Priestley also exhibits a good eye for cinematography. Somehow, the sets never feel like sets. The plot won't bowl you over with anything stupendous or revolutionary. But the narrative stays even-keeled, other than an impromptu food fight that erupts from a staid brunch and a tiresome shopping sequence.

And if you were wondering who sings that melodic slow song playing in the background near the end, her name is Jocelyn Alice and the song is ""Tonight."" I'm mentioning this because it took me a while to track down the tune.

Several conflicts spring up, but we don't really sweat it. It's that kind of movie. Unpaid bills threaten to shut down the soup kitchen by Christmas eve. Crystal hasn't yet told Derek and Olivia that she has Olivia's letter. And then there's Derek's calculating girlfriend (a terrific Gina Holden) who accurately perceives Crystal as competition.

Patrick Creery has a breezy supporting role as the stylish soup kitchen chef who acts as matchmaker. Who knew a smart fashion sense can save Christmas and land a girl a blue-collar hunk? Liberated women may or may not tear out their hair, but this is a fun romantic comedy for the holidays.",1338163200,27,3590,5.045531197301855
4714395,5,B005K1VPY4,"I love watching Christmas movies with my husband every holiday.  After DVR'ing this one last season, I needed to have a copy.

Thanks, Amazon for having this heartwarming movie available at a price I couldn't resist! It will be enjoyed over and over again!",1337731200,7,394,4.507042253521127
4714396,5,B005K1VPY4,"This movie is a perfect Christmas story.  It is well casted and well acted. I wish there could be a follow up story after Dereck and Crystal marry or during that time.
It would be hysterical to watch her parents in a blue collar setting. We need more fun movies.",1335571200,7,262,4.24
4714397,5,B005K1VPY4,"This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I am still watching it and it's March!!  The plot is so very good and the actors and actresses are great.  It is a movie about a young lady about 30 years old who had not spent many Christmas or special times with her parents.  Her mother goes with her father on business trips.  Crystal's parents have been supporting her until now but have given her until Christmas to turn her life around.  It's Christmas time and Amber is buying all sorts of clothes for parties and such.  So...she had her list and was on her way to buy more outfits when she saw a dress in the window of a store she obviously shopped at often.  The mail man was getting the mail out of a box there in front of the store where Amber was looking.  A letter flew right in Amber's path and she caught the letter.  Looking at the red dress made her put the letter in her pocket and she went on shopping.

She was home and she remembered to look at the letter and she opened it.  The letter was from a young girl and she was not asking for any gift for herself but she wanted a wife for her father.  Someone beautiful and nice so they could have a family again. Her father and Olivia had been sad since his wife and her mom passed a year this Christmas.  Amber took the contents of the letter very seriously so she found the return address and drove tho their house to see the little girl and her father.  After some stops here and there Amber follows Derek to a 'soup kitchen' which his wife had started when she was alive and he promised to keep it going as long as possible.  Amber stops and goes in to see where Derek had led her.

At this point the movie is set mostly at the 'soup kitchen' and it shows a spoiled but beautiful young lady doing work she had never done in her life but she found it very rewarding and she saw Olivia, the young girl at the kitchen and they became close.  Amber and Olivia were not fond of Derek's so called girl friend, Jillian.  As time goes by Amber works closely with Derek and they did things together like taking Olivia to get new clothes.  Her father had not noticed his daughter's clothes had become old looking.

The movie becomes a fight between Jillian and Crystal for Derek.  Crystal did not tell Derek about the letter she found but had told the chef at the 'soup kitchen' and both him and Amber thought it was 'fate' that is getting them together.  Jillian looks through Crystals purse and finds the letter.  Derek was very angry with Amber but then things turned when Amber has the money to pull the 'soup kitchen' out of being closed for unpaid bills of ten thousand dollars.  Amber's mom and dad sent her ten thousand dollars for Christmas and to hold her over to get started supporting herself.  The little girl, Olivia becomes very angry with her father since he was angry with Amber and he would not let Olivia talk with her.  Olivia ends up going to a huge Christmas tree where she and her mom once sent up wishes.  She left without telling her dad or anyone.  When he finds his little girl all things become clear to all parties.  Somehow Olivia, Amber and Derek end up at the same place THIS IS ONE GREAT MOVIE.

Love her quiet manner and cute responses.  The guy is great too and so is the little girl and so was the cook.  I would buy it again in a minute.
There were a couple flaws in the show such as it is cold weather and the clerk comes out of the store with no sleeves.  They call the snow blade a ""bucket.""  Crystal says she googled the address of the letter and there was no return address on the card or the letter.  Oliva gets new clothes but after that she still wears the same old clothes.

4714403,5,B005K1VPY4,"Sure this movie is very similar to other Holdiay movies with  either a singe parent or a young adult struggling with life/finances/children when suddenly someone comes into their life to change it for the better. BUT..read on.
Amy Acker is attractive but not overly so and she works perfect for the  part as Crystal. (I previoulsy had not heard of her.)  But the draw for me was more than looks--the facial expressions Amy Acker exhibiits and the vocal repsonses at key times are just adorable and beleivable. She sells me on how much she loves the little girl. She sells me that she is NOT changing her daily life just to compete with her rival for the fun of it.  She persuades me that she is really falling for the whole life style and of course the father of the child. And when Crystal has unsure moments or embarassing moments they are acted superbly. There are a few uncomforatable moments for Crystal and you live them with her.

The father (Derek) is also portrayed well. I especially noticed  the admiring glances when Derek sees his daughter Olivia  genuinely interact with Amy's character(Chrystal). It as if Crystal  was the MOM his daughter does not have.  He is also beleivable in his moments of disgust with Crystal. There is chemistry here.
 I have wathced this movie 3 times on lifetime and plan to buy it. I am almost addicted to it.  I do not watch a ton of TV movies nor have I reviewed a movie.

In December 2010 I watched part of a similar TV holiday movie(The Most Womderful Time of the Year) but missed the last 1/2 hour. For one whole year I have been  very curious to see the ending.  This year I recorded that movie in whole, but have not even bothered to watch it because I keep watching DEAR SANTA.",1322956800,51,1728,4.479233226837061
