2327194,5,B0009WDVUA,"Utilizing the same cast that he used to make Veil of Blood (aka Vampire Ecstasy), Joe Sarno presents us with another well made piece of erotica. Some of the dialog is genuinely ridiculous (a situation not helped by the mixture of German & Swedish accents), but this tale of a teen girl's romp through bisexuality is genuinely sexy. Sarno knows how to shoot a good softcore sex scene, so who cares about the dialogue? You don't watch a film like this for the plot anyway.",1215561600,25,470,4.541176470588235
2327195,5,B0009WDVUA,"This is an excellent example of 70's soft core sex films.  On a par with ""Score"" this one is more about lesbian sex than hetero.  The lead is an innocent looking, attractive woman in her early 20's.  She goes to stay with her jaded looking older aunt and her aunt's live-in ""companion"" and begins a series or progressively more adventurous trysts with women of the village.  The actresses are mostly very appealing and the sex, while controlled at the ""R"" level is still quite erotic.  There is even some light s&m that inexplicably comes into two scenes.  The plot is thin, the acting varies from weak to reasonable and the cinematography is good.  But it's the sex that you buy this movie for and it delivers in a big way.  One of the better films of its genre, particularly if you like g/g sex.  Enjoy!",1204416000,51,805,4.496551724137931
2327196,5,B0009WDVUA,"As far as an adult movie goes...R rated and all..it was very entertaining.

Ms. Marie(BUTTERFLIES)Forsa...was a pure joy to watch . I found the story to be of course very adult like...but at the same time...very powerful situlations. Ms Forsa was & is STILL a very beauitful woman. Her face of beauty is stunnng. For those who like adult features I would say they would also enjoy it. And catch Ms. Forsa in her best of best adult movies..""Butterflies"".Ms. Forsa from Sweden...is a beauty.",1178928000,12,489,4.821428571428571

8068141,5,B0009WDVUA,"Every so often an actress comes along that is so beautiful, that it hurts to look at her.  Maybe, beautiful is not the right word for Marie Forsa, maybe I should use the term Erotic!  For that is what she is, blonde hair, good figure, pouty lips, a great smile, and a body to die for.  I first saw her in a horror film, I cannot remember the title of.  I was taken by her from then on, she is sensual, erotic, enticing, all the things you want in a woman.
Every time I have since, I have tried to find her video's I search video web sites on a regular basis to see if there is anything new with her in it.
At this point I believe I have four DVD films of Marie's, but I believe that there are more out there that have not been released to the U.S.  I will just have to keep searching.  Watching Marie interact with other females is pure lust, it makes me want to ask, whether she prefers making out with men or women?",1483833600,,917,3.9836065573770494

8068145,1,B0009WDVUA,"Politically correct in every way. Ok, lets start--nobody work here, nobody has any problems, things are plentiful, money don't exist--I guess  its a communism realized but where? Wish I was there but I am here. Yeah, we see some skin and even dildos and skinned cucumber and?  Highly recommended for ages between 8 and 12.",1404345600,2,322,4.836363636363636
8068146,1,B0009WDVUA,This movie was poorly acted and not good overall will not recommend it to others.  Do not buy it at all,1381708800,,103,3.9047619047619047
8068147,3,B0009WDVUA,"The movie is just ok.  Typical ""R"" rated movie of the 70's.  I enjoy a little more real life passion",1356739200,5,100,3.95
8068148,2,B0009WDVUA,"Ok, 3 rating with 5 stars? Come on! This movie is so boring, has barely a story and the acting is very poor! I think you rated this movie 5 stars because its nearly all girl-girl action! Basically a young girl goes to her aunt (she passes herself as a virgin) but she does all of her aunt girlfriends (and the aunt as well) and in the end of the movie she gets angry at everybody and leaves, that's it! The sex scenes are really poor! The story (what story?) is silly, and there is way to much pubic hair (ok, it was the 70's)...",1215734400,14,529,4.0476190476190474
