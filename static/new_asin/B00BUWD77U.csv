The image quality is on par with what I could probably get from my Canon HD camcorder if I was riding in a tour helicopter: the footage is shaky, very bad in some scenes, and the footage is blurry in the higher elevation shots like around Mt Rainier.  In some scenes you can see a reflection from the glass inside their plane, so in this regard I was really disappointed with the quality.  Having said this, the music and narration  is quite good and for the low price I rate the video at 3 stars.

Living in Oregon I'm a bit disappointed they spent a few minutes on the Cascade mountain range, with only a few seconds on each of the main peaks and they totally skipped over Crater Lake on the way the the Sierras and Yosemite.  I'm not sure why they did that.",1399161600,,926,4.354651162790698

5676788,5,B00BUWD77U,"Howdy;

I really don't know if this was the first in the series, but it does make for a good introduction of what follows.

As for the claim that the shots were shaky, it was shot from planes and 'choppers that are prone to wind currents.  To me, it would seem odd if it didn't shake.

The video is sharp, clear and bright.  It make my 47"" LED like a window in the plane.  The Narration by Alphonse Keasley is interesting and informative.  The music is super great and David Arkenstone catches the moment of each scene.

The price of this and all the others of this series is great for what you get.  Running time is about 64 minutes.

BTW, two more (Acadia and Death Valley) are being released on September 10, 2013.  I WILL BE GETTING THEM AS WELL!

What can I say, I'm just a plain and simple Mountain Man and I love my home theater.  Hope this helps out.

5676789,4,B00BUWD77U,this is very well done very informative but not VERY long 1hr 4M. OTHERWISE good program starting on the east coast and meandering across the states to the west coast when they were parks then elevated to NATIONAL PARKS.all very well but i think they should be a little longer minimum 90 mins the cuz (they lost a star for length),1376352000,4,330,4.426229508196721
5676790,5,B00BUWD77U,As a pilot I appreciate this video.  I wish they would put out a second video showing additional parks.  Great video.,1376352000,,117,4.523809523809524
5676791,2,B00BUWD77U,"I have to ask whether this was shot by professionals. Many of the scenes look hazy, as if the video was shot through the aircraft windows. And that's because it obviously was shot through the aircraft windows. Worse, this is the shakiest aerial video I have seen.
The narration is fine, except for a couple of factual errors. For example, Rocky Mountain National Park only has one ""Fourteener"" peak, not a great concentration of them as the script states. David Arkenstone's music is fine throughout.
Despite the faults, the scenic beauty depicted in this video may please some viewers. For better HD quality, check out the PBS ""Visions Of___"" and ""Over___"" series.",1372377600,10,665,4.946428571428571
8574307,5,B00BUWD77U,Should be a great Blu-ray.  Haven't watched.,1504915200,,44,5.285714285714286
8574308,2,B00BUWD77U,"This video is suppose to be about ""National Parks"".  Puzzling that the cover picture for the Blu Ray case shows Emerald Bay in Lake Tahoe, a California STATE Park.  The Bay itself is designated as a National Natural Landmark, but not a National Park.  The island centerpiece is Fannette Island, which has no designation as a National Park.  The producer of this video should be ashamed of themselves for such a grievous error with the cover photo.",1493596800,,447,4.766233766233766

8574312,2,B00BUWD77U,"Poorly done. The arial photography is consistently jerky and often has an airplane wing strut at the very edge of the photo. Sometimes you can see reflections on the plane window as the camera shoots through the window, instead of lowering it prior to shooting. It appears that much of the video was shot without a tripod, while trying to hold the camera still by hand alone. Very dissappointing.",1464048000,,396,4.753623188405797
8574313,3,B00BUWD77U,"Another case of you get what you pay for.  The camera mount on the planes and helicopters was shaky, the altitude was almost always too high, and sometimes the view was obstructed by dirty or scratched windows.  Compared to another video I have which is just over Maine this one is not good.  I doubt I will ever watch it again.",1457568000,,328,4.344262295081967
8574314,1,B00BUWD77U,"Amateur photography is shaky and not for anyone who gets motion sickness.  I was hoping this would be a more professional setup with proper steadicam style smooth camera work.  There is no style in the cinematography, no slow zooms or tracking shots.  Everything is shot through the window of an airplane, with reflections visible.  The ""Over America"" series swoops low to the ground with breathtaking cinematography that is shot by a more seasoned professional.  ""Eagles View"" is mostly wideshots in order to minimise the shakiness, but gives the viewer no real detail to admire in the landscape.  Like I mentioned, I would instead look for the ""Over America"" series or the ""Visions""  (Visions of Ireland, Visions of France, etc.) to see stunning landscapes of Europe from the air.  Don't waste your money on this.",1444780800,,815,5.029850746268656
8574315,1,B00BUWD77U,"What A Waste!!! This is no ""Eagle's View"" . Much of the footage is shot from about 30,000 feet! Instead of views of the western national parks, footage is shot in WINTER with everything a mass of white. No money was spent on any professional photographer and is all a hazy mess from an airplane window. Couldn't they have at least photgraphed this in SUMMER/ I turned this off after about 30 minutes when it became clear that the $5. I spent on it was overpriced by about 4.99!",1409529600,4,477,4.370786516853933
8574316,2,B00BUWD77U,"My whole family found this hard to watch- annoying shaky camera, poor quality for a blu-ray, mediocre narration.  Plus the shots are just not that interesting and the parks in general look much less impressive from high up as they do in person. Most of the footage is way up in the air so it is hard to get a feel for scale. At least it was cheap, but it is cheap for a reason. This is no hidden gem.",1404777600,4,400,4.0
