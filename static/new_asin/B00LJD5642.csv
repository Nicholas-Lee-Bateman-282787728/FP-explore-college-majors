Black guy's a thug and rapist ( of White women, of course), Middle Eastern guy's a cowardly back-stabber (can't trust any of 'em) and the janitor is a child molester (aren't they all?). This thing is just an offensive parade of insults and stereotypes. Thank God there were no Asian characters. They'd probably talk like Charlie Chan. Horrible movie written by a troglodyte.

6488122,5,B00LJD5642,"Went into this movie figuring that it was prime and we could quit if we got bored.  We were hooked within the first five minutes.

If you're looking for a gore-fest, this isn't it, though there are some extremely gory moments. The acting was fabulous, the setting was nicely done.  The effects tended to be a bit sub-par, but the rest of the movie made up for it.  Kept two jaded horror nuts watching all the way through, which doesn't happen often.

Also, the people who made this move ... blatant fans of Supernatural.",1425600000,13,520,4.48936170212766

6488126,2,B00LJD5642,"Whether it was a haunted house, warehouse or even a cube, you've seen the premise before. A random assortment of people brought together for unknown reasons and they can't seem to find a way to escape. I like that model and have seen it done with satisfying results. Not here.
Low budget production value, poorly written dialogue and some weak acting kept me out of this story and that's too bad because the story itself had some merits. However, if you are 15, you may find this fun. Also, this is perfect for a drinking game where you bet on who dies next-everyone who's wrong drinks.",1420070400,3,586,4.537735849056604
6488127,4,B00LJD5642,"The film opens with a man (Ry Barrett) involved in a car accident. We see fragmented pieces of his life passing by and then suddenly a watch piece stops ticking. He wakes up in what appears to be an abandoned hospital along with others who don't remember anything either. If you think they were abducted for a reality game show with a DVD title like ""Kingdom Come."" stop reading here because you are bout to get a PLOT SPOILER that a healthy minded person would already have figured out.

As it turns out some of the people's lives are connected as they are given one last chance to face their demons and vices.

There are other films following the same story line that have more of a mystery. There was no mystery for me as to what was going on after the first two minutes. The film creates fair characters but could have used some dark humor elements. The effects were okay and I thought the horror element tried to hard.

Worth a rental. 3 1/2 stars if you don't mind a story about salvation and redemption mixed with F-bombs, c-words, rape, and nudity (Stephanie Marie Capeling, Margarita Giliadov, Madison Crocker)",1416700800,17,1119,4.557213930348259

Reminds me of The Scared (another B rated horror movie but better then this one!), the movie was annyoying at the begining to say the least. The plot is overdone (I DO like that they used a hospital), the charaters aren't that well protrayed BUT I DO like that they used lesser know acters and actresses (at least I have never seen them before!). The CGI was corny, but the makeup, set designers and wardrobe people were REALLY inventive!
The whole redemption theme got boring after EVERYONE but the last 2 people killed.. and the whole running corridor after corrodor kinda annoying. I had to whole movie figured out by minute 5. Execpt for the little girl, she was the most confusing and head scratching person in this! Then when they talked about the main actresses abortion... DUH!!

6488151,5,B00LJD5642,"I loved this movie. It has the devil, sin, demons, guilt, struggle for humans souls and most of all, forgiveness and redemption.

It wasn't high budget, no huge stars, the vast majority was filmed in some abandoned building. But I found the acting great (I never said to myself, ""No one would say or do that"").I found the special effects to be excellent. The demons were phenomenal and the devil is just the way you'd imagine him to be, kind of Hollywood slick.

People wake up in an abandoned building and start fighting about trivial stuff. That is a very true thing people do, and I was hoping it wouldn't be the whole movie (that gets annoying) and it wasn't.

Note the line in the credits where they said no animals, gatekeepers or demons were harmed in the making of the film? :)

I hope this company makes many more excellent films like this one.

I didn't like the very, very end in the ambulance, but that's a small slip, as it wasn't part of the main story.",1450483200,,967,4.410112359550562
6488152,3,B00LJD5642,"Low budget, but still held my attention. It had a different twist to the usual ""trapped in the old building"" type of movie. Acting was Ok at best, with a few mediocre performances and one good actor. Not bad.",1450396800,,208,4.358974358974359
6488153,4,B00LJD5642,"As an Atheist, I generally frown upon sin and redemption disguised as horror films, but I must say that this one entertained me. Eight people, including a young girl, wake up at an abandoned hospital (The movie was filmed in a real abandoned mental hospital in the town of London, Ontario, Canada) with no idea how they got there. I know what you are thinking: They are all in Hell and have to pay for their sins in the worst way, but you would be wrong. None of them seemingly know each other, but there is evidence that they are all connected in some way, even if it's a trivial matter. There also seems to be no means of escape from the hospital. The angry Roger (JoJo Karume) sticks his arm out of a boarded-up window a few stories up, but something with sharp teeth bites him in the arm. Roger (who is the only black man among them) has a major attitude problem and leaves the group to go searching for a way out on his own. The other seven split up onto two groups and go searching for the same thing. Every once in a while, a member of the group has a flashback that gives us a little piece of their background and none of these flashbacks paint a good picture of any of them. But in their flashbacks is usually another member of the trapped group. Turns out that Roger was a notorious rapist and all his female victims (none of them have a stitch of clothing on) appear in the basement and rip Roger's stomach open, throwing his innards into the air. Victoria (Chelsey Marie) goes to take a pee and when she gets out of the stall, a junkie hands her a needle and the next thing we see is Victoria screaming and being pulled under the stalls (It's apparent Victoria was a junkie). Nadir (Soroush Saeidi) gets a visit from his dead daughter Meesha (Sima Sepehri), who he accidentally killed by smacking her in the face and falling down a flight of stairs just for the mere fact she was dating a black man and he is forced to hang himself with electrical wire before discovering it was all a hallucination (Or was it?). Sam (Ry Barrett) has a flashback where he killed his wife in a drunk driving accident while they were celebrating their anniversary. Roaming the halls is the debonairre Daniel Levine (Jason Martorino) and his entourage of ""Gatekeepers"", winged demons from the bowels of Hell. He takes particular interest in Sam and Jessica (Camille Hollett-French), who seem to be the keys to this whole hospital haunting. He kills some of the people in the abandoned hospital (some of which we are never formally introduced to) according to their crimes and the Gatekeepers drag the bodies away. But what could be little girl Celia's (Ellie O'Brien) crime? What could a pre-teen girl be so responsible for that she needs a demon to pass judgment on her? Pedophile Charles (William Foley) finds Celia hiding in a dryer and takes her hand and leads her away. Will his urges come over him before Sam and Jessica can save her (they have grown quite fond of her)? A child from Charles past, now a woman named Rachel (Katie Uhlmann; who is part of the original eight), goes to kill Charles because of sexual things he did to her in his past and Sam must fight a war of words with Daniel to get her to stop from killing Charles. Daniel wins (this time) and Rachel beats Charles to death with a pipe and the Gatekeepers drag Rachel away (Human nature is a tough act to break). ""I can smell you, my little meat sacks!"" is what Daniel says as he chases Sam, Rachel and Celia through the hospital corridors. Sam cuts off Daniel's hand when he grabs Rachel's hair but seconds later, we see Daniel with two hands again. Sam is magically dragged away by Daniel, but Jess seems to be in a room that Daniel can't enter. Jess leaves the room to save Sam's life and she stabs Daniel in the eye, but Daniel begins to psychically choke the life out of Sam, while Jess begs him to stop. Daniel makes Jess aware that Sam's drunk driving caused the death of her husband and herself. ""It must just eat away at you like a **********er!"" is Daniel's reply as he tries to get her to kill Sam. Jess instead says to Sam, ""I forgive you!"", which leaves Daniel powerless to do anything. Turns out Celia is working on the side of God, trying to find the good in people (she found it in Nadir) and, as the instrument of God, Daniel is pulled through a wall by some demon hands. Celia is also the ghostly apparition of Jess' aborted baby and she forgives Jess for her indiscretions (Jess was just a teenager when it happened), so Celia whispers, ""172. She's waiting."" to Sam, touches his cheek and suddenly Sam is at the automobile accident (seems like it was more of a pile-up than a two-car accident, as we see several people from the abandoned hospital, including Nadir, at the scene). Sam is able to locate Jess at mile marker 172 and the ambulance takes Jess away. Looks like she will have a nice life (although still husbandless). As Sam is strapped to the inside of the ambulance, Daniel appears and says, ""Better buckle up Sammy Boy! It's going to be a bumpy ride!"" Sam may be damned to Hell for his sins, but at least he did the right thing when it counted most.  Never preachy or overtly religious, this supernatural film with some severe dollops of gore and nudity (Roger's death is a doozy and we can now understand why he is so confrontational in the beginning of the film. It has nothing to do with his color.), director/editor/co-producer/co-screenwriter (with Geoff Hart [Producer of UNEARTHLY - 2013 and TAPPED OUT - 2014]) Greg A. Sager (DEVIL SEED - 2012) makes an eerie little film with lots of atmosphere thanks to filming at an actual abandoned mental hospital. It may take the viewer several viewings to see what Mr. Sager was aiming for here (religious people may get the inference sooner than most other people), but this is a good little horror film with religious undertones. Being an Atheist, films like this don't bother me, especially if they are as entertaining as this one. Give this Canadian film a try and you may just find yourself creeped out by the way it is filmed and the connections between most of the cast. I will definitely watch more films by Greg Sager when they come out, especially if they offer the mystery and forgiveness (to a point) a film like this rarely shows. Good stuff to make you feel better about your own life unless you are worse than the people shown on screen. Also starring Bruce Turner, Colin Paradine, Stephanie Capeling, Kim Kaitall and Kat Krawczuk, Korinne Goudreau, Emily Deruytter, Matthew Chiu and Katherine Prentice as the winged Gatekeepers (really well done creature effects).

On the surface, it looked like the kind of crappy B-horror that I usually enjoy. The synopsis said that it was about a handful of people who woke up in an abandoned hospital with no idea how they got there, and that they were all being hunted by some shadowy figures bumping around the building. Sounds innocuous enough. Spoiler alert: the devil is running the show, and people on the show are being punished for their sins. Imagine the most bulls*** sins you can. Now imagine that the writers of this movie assigned these sins to the different characters in order to reinforce racial and gendered stereotypes to remind the audience that only white men can be trusted. Now imagine a pro-life anti-women agenda thrown in. Thats this movie in a nutshell. Aside from the bad acting (painful), the stupid storyline (depressingly unoriginal), and the dismal, badly designed monsters, the fundy Christian, racist, sexist agenda makes this movie probably the worst Ive ever seen.

Irrationally angry people arguing and fighting for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
Absurd stereotypes and thinly veiled religious propaganda.
Characters that suddenly cant speak, answer a simple question, or communicate in any way.
Horrible, horrible, nonsensical decision making.
And a strong fair skinned alpha male leader to figure everything out for the lesser characters.

6488216,3,B00LJD5642,"As far as your average horror movie goes, this is actually fairly decent. Sure, it's nothing particularly spectacular but the fact that it doesn't involve shaky cam or 'found footage' nonsense earns it some points in my book.

The movie starts out with a guy waking up in a dilapidated, horror-standard deserted hospital. He quick encounters a woman, finds she's in the same mental straits, having no clue where they are, how they got there, or anything at all from recent memory. After a rather strange encounter, they actually do something amusing and introduce the rest of the cast in one fell swoop after he takes a headshot from a blunt object.

Of course no one else knows what's going on, and this is about as ragtag a band as you could possibly hope NOT to end up stuck with in a horror movie, but it gives further clues as to just how strange things are becoming.

Around this point, you can probably guess what's really going on, just from the very questionable personalities they encounter here. The most notable are the overly-violent black man with a chip on his shoulder and a stereotype he's living up to, and the rather creepy guy in the worker's coveralls who shows an unhealthy interest in the little girl that's been found.

This movie is chock full of the worst tropes that horror uses... I don't know about you, but if I ended up in a situation where things have gone horribly, horribly wrong, I wouldn't be splitting up with the rest of the people around  me regardless of how much they might annoy me. That sort of thing.

The pacing is fairly slow, and there's not much to really scare the viewer, but there's a good atmosphere going on that will, at least through a first viewing, keep you interested enough to watch just one more scene. Possibly.

And don't let the cover fool you, sure you run across the critters in the movie, but they're not nearly as terrifying as they might have been if the movie had a special effects budget and the writing to have them DO something. They actually have more to do with a secondary character who shows up fairly late in the game, and is actually fairly entertaining in terms of scripted personality.

The only thing that really had me roll my eyes, despite all the other tropes along the way, was the 'surprise' second twist at the end of the movie, a clich that has been used, abused, and beaten to death by a horse by now.

All in all, if you have a free bit of time and an itch fir something better than a lot of the current horror schlock, then you could certainly do worse than this.",1441324800,2,2554,4.475268817204301

Well, in my honest opinion Canada should show a little pride and make the movie Canadian, rather than generic North American.  I know, not everyone can hear it, and if it were only one actor, who cares?  Everyone in this one is so obviously Canadian and so obviously trying to conceal it for the US.  At least M. Night Shyamalan makes everything about Philadelphia, even if he gets a few touches wrong.
So, onto the broad strokes, there's a little SAW, a little EXORCIST, a little DEVIL, and a little PROPHECY.  You can more or less figure it out from one or two beats that the director gives to certain characters.  I don't mean to say it is predictable, but it does telegraph its punches.

6488366,3,B00LJD5642,"It is a classic framing device that has the dying conscience facing retribution in limbo scenario playing out in macabre and horrific melodrama. Okay I know that I just did a spoiler no-no but the story concept is obvious from the start in Kingdom Come, and because often times movies that play this curious spiritual situation out can be boring, I want that out of the way because this film is actually interesting, entertaining and creative. Once that manifestum is dealt with then it opens the story up to be enjoyed for the character developments, chilling aspects of horror, and backstory.

The cinematography and direction Sager and his team gives us is a strong, visual nightmare, that is captivating. The acting, at times gets choppy, but for the most part the cast bring these characters to life with real emotion. On the surface they seem like 2 dimensional characters but during the course of their journey, the dimensions to these peoples individual stories get deep, dark and affective. That is why I hint to the nature of Kingdom Come concept, because the real gem of this film is the journey and revelation of character offered within. The situations are creative, disturbing, and relative to the underbelly of global social constructs.

The special effects and overall environment of Kingdom Come is that of horror attraction on steroids. The location, haunting nature, and dark subject matter push the soul facing death scenario beyond redundancy and into terrifying grounds. The antagonist and his companions are expected evil aspects that could seem clich&eacute; or transparent, but in this set-up work perfectly to really keep the story arch solid, fluid, and macabre. Kingdom Come is a morality tale, and the creature effects and scene designs really amp up the chilling nature of the story. The ending is a bit of an expected let-down, but I have never found any film that uses this concept to be surprising or go out with a bang.",1431475200,,1953,4.951219512195122

Studio need to fired whoever designed it.

With that said, this is actually a really great film, especially when considering that this is a low budget B-listed film and you probably hadn't even heard of any of its actors.
Speaking of actors, the director needs to start holding audition for requirement purposes instead of just hiring whoever he is banging. Their acting skills are above the same as your average college drama club member.

6488456,5,B00LJD5642,"Yes - It's a horror film.  And, exactly the type that I enjoy, because it has clever twists and a deeper, underlying message.  If you're tired of the same old kind of Saw-copycat film where several people are kidnapped by a psycho and bad things happen to them because of something that they have in common - this is NOT one of those... although you may think so for the first few minutes.  Also, the demons look seriously real - excellent makeup.  The cover art is great - but the demons in the film look truly real.  Aside from the suspense, original story, and difficult-to-predict twists... the cinematography and the building that most of the movie takes place in - were perfect. I'm an actor and screenwriter, and though don't know what the budget was for this film, I am guessing that it was relatively small, and well spent - because the quality is excellent.  It's a clever reminder that things we do affect other people, and while we may enjoy them now - we also may eventually have to pay a price (or... we may just get away with a few things).  Oh - and if you're a woman who has ever been manipulated or abused by a guy, there's a little extra fun in there - just for you.  (Guys, if you're watching this with your slightly feisty lady who tends to really get into a movie - it might be best to wear a ""cup"" or sit across the room.)

6488555,1,B00LJD5642,"The gore was good and the devil was sexy, but it was a parade of racial and socioeconomic stereotypes and offensive X-tian nonsense. The messages in this movie are vomit-inducing. Got an abortion as a teenager? Well, you're going to hell! Can't forgive your rapist? Hell! Go out at night and do drugs? Take a guess...

I mean, granted, those were the ""crimes"" that the female characters were guilty of. Which, is somehow on par with serial rape and murder, serial child rape, murdering one's own daughter, and vehicular manslaughter. Not to mention, all of the victims of THESE crimes were female, so I guess that means they don't *count* as much.

Seriously, only a movie based on a violent, misogynistic mythology could equate ""raping a child"" and ""she didn't forgive him"" as wrongdoings deserving of a similar punishment. Why don't we make this film even more ""righteous"" and include a scene where the victim is forced to marry him.

And I haven't even finished the movie yet...

Edit: Seriously. The ""worst crime"" in the movie, the one that gets the most screen time is ABORTION?? Really? Couldn't the filmmaker have saved a lot of money if he would have just stood outside of clinics and screamed abuse DIRECTLY at women? Stupid, stupid movie.",1426809600,,1248,4.817757009345795

I did not care for the end but that is because I'm something of a purist... horror has no semi-happy endings. Also, a couple of other problems: the chances of those particular people ending up in the same place at the same time are unrealistic. Each person there had done something in their life to be there; everyone but Celia. Her presence was completely unreasonable, even when her identity is revealed. She was completely innocent. Her presence and power take away from the horror. Redemption rules were inconsistent as well in the end; maybe that was an attempt to retain horror but it failed.

8666208,4,B00LJD5642,"Wow!  Kingdom Come's awesome!  And good thing because I've been seeing some crappy horror films as of late.  About time a real one comes along.

It's about a group of people that wake up trapped in an abandoned building.  Sound familiar?  Of course!  Saw.  Saw does the same thing!  But in that case the people are trapped and have to strategically find a way out.  The characters in Kingdom Come are free to do as they wish with nobody making them do anything.  At least... not right away!  In the case of Kingdom Come, expect one twist after another!  It's almost hard to believe how good this movie gets at times.  Okay the first 20 minutes is a little predictable and slow, but after that get ready man!

When the group of people discuss how they're going to get out of this abandoned building, it's a little funny they're standing around calm when introducing themselves.  ""Hi, my name's Thomas.  I'm trapped here too.  Happy to meet you!""  Okay it's not quite *that* silly but the people aren't exactly eager to get out.  Instead they want to argue over petty things and make enemies early.  For whatever reason the one African American of the group is heavily criticized.  Lots of racist jokes and assumption about his lifestyle based on what seems to be his skin color only.  Boo!  Well there *is* a reason for the assumptions from the one man that's revealed later, but it's still really ridiculous.

When the blonde woman of the group searches around for the bathroom and uses it, she soon sees what appears to be a homeless man holding a needle, and he encourages her to use it.  She... walks closer and accepts.  Drug addiction stinks!  She's soon killed however.  Sorry if that's a spoiler but hey, I'm about to reveal a bunch more SPOILERS so it's probably a good idea you watch the movie first then read my review.  That would be a splendid idea!  *rubs hands maliciously*  Just kidding!

I had to laugh at one illogical scene early on.  As an experiment to see how high they are in the building, one man throws a bottle through the crack of a boarded window.  The bottle doesn't land which is supposed to mean it's a looooong way down but... wouldn't it be funny if the bottle landed on a fluffy blanket 3 feet down?  At least the one (African American) guy said ""What if it landed on grass and didn't make a sound!""  Someone gets it!

Let me mention the storyline.  At first it's confusing.  All these people are brought to this abandoned building for a reason.  The reason will make perfect sense by the end of the movie.  The characters split up and roam around looking for a way out.  Some of them stay together.  Walking around makes up most of the movie.  Every so often they'll see familiar people, in particular their deceased loved ones.  These loved ones tie into negative memories and traumatic experiences the family had to go through.

For example the reason this one guy hated the African American is because his daughter dated a black guy, and he didn't like that.  Things got violent and the father slapped his daughter across the face prompting her to fall down the living room stairs and die.  If that's not bad enough, the father pointed the blame to the African American guy, so off he goes in the back of a cop car.  The father now has to be punished for his actions by way of a hanging.

Here's another example, and one that ties into the storyline.  A man, woman and a very confident looking man all try to find a way out.  Actually just the one man is doing the work- the confident guy and the woman just stand there and bombard the man with one question after another.  The confident man is actually the devil, but for now we don't realize this.  I should've figured as such.  He's so calm and in control of everything while everyone else is scared.  Anyway, for now, it's unintentionally hilarious that the confident guy/devil asks the man all kinds of questions because he looks familiar but can't figure out where he's seen him before.

In a twist however, suddenly the woman remembers who the guy is!  Wow this guy must be popular.  Everyone knows who he is!  Actually he's a child molester who took advantage of this woman when she was a kid.  She runs out of the room crying as the devil and man try to figure out what's wrong with her.  You might say she gets her revenge on the guy later on when confronted with a choice- either side with the devil and kill that no good child molester with a shovel, or take a reasonable approach without sin since that child molester's fate is already sealed and leave him be.  This is when it's obvious this guy's the devil and everyone's running away from him.  Good thing the woman arrived with that shovel when she did- that guy was about to take advantage of the little girl in the group.  He claims his sexual behavior is a disease while begging for his life.  Just smack him already!

Anyway the African American guy doesn't last long either.  But you know, speaking for myself, having a bunch of attractive naked women ripping my organs out isn't the worst way to go.  Just saying!  Now what makes this movie interesting is that there's not only mental torment and horrible memories coming back to haunt these characters (along with these deceased loved ones trapped inside the building with them) but there's also demons growling and lurking behind the walls.  The devil encourages these characters to bring out their secret angry side, and if they refuse the demons won't mind ripping these people apart!  The devil also loses his hand in one scene only to reattach it a moment later.  He can't fix his poked eye though!

The story that ties everything together concerns the woman who lost her husband in a car accident, and the man she walks around the abandoned building with.  The two have a history and don't realize it.  It's predictable I admit.  I uh... just spoiled it by not saying anything, hehe.  Oops!  Earlier the man says he knew the woman's husband when she holds up a picture of him, which freaks her out.  He claims he saw the man in this building.  She cusses him out.  ""No you didn't you liar!"".  He probably shouldn't have said the woman's husband looks familiar because it just adds more to this predictable segment.  Anyway the devil encourages the woman to kill him after... you know... the part I accidentally admitted without saying anything. But will she do it?  Will she beat him to death with a shovel?

And the twists don't end there!  The little girl of the group has an amazing secret.  Well... it comes across in a way where I'm not sure what exactly happens at the very end.  Maybe her existence or at least her conversation with the the man who claims he saw that woman's husband isn't real.  I can't really say.  I've said enough!  Man I'm just spoiling too much.  It's unintentionally hilarious how the characters try not to cuss around the little girl but end up doing it anyway.  Reminds me of being a kid and my dad and his girlfriend getting into fights.  The heavy Molly Hatchet-like catchy guitar instrumental during the credits is incredible though!

Awesome acting, a twist-filled story and lots of good stuff await you in this movie.  Maybe not quite 5 stars since the beginning is a little predictable and it lasts 20 minutes at least, but otherwise awesome movie.",1497398400,,7304,4.543846153846154
