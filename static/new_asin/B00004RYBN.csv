1344298,1,B00004RYBN,"This film, although sporting many elaborate Hollywood props full of explosions and tribal wars, has taken a potentially exciting and meaningful screenplay and altered many key components of Defoe's original novel to incorporate a mushy love story (taking away from the feel of Defoe's original). Many dramatic and important scenes I hoped would be in the movie were either altered beyond recognition or missing altogether, and the ""politically correct"" additions are a final blow to this sinking ship. This film is about as true to the novel as the 1970 animated version with talking animals.",1057968000,21,592,5.242105263157895
1344299,5,B00004RYBN,"I don't know how the plot of this film compares with the book - I read it so long ago that I remember only Crusoe, Friday, and the bad guys from the other island, all of whom are here. What I can say is that this is an elegantly filmed, well-acted survival story. It grabs you right at the beginning and holds its intensity right through to the end. Pierce Brosnan is excellent as Robinson Crusoe. (I like him best in films where he has a chance to do more than look pretty such as ""Taffin,"" ""The Heist,"" ""The Tailor of Panama,"" and ""Evelyn,"" along with this one.) And William Takaku makes a believable Friday. In this version, Crusoe goes through hell, but comes home to a happy ending.",1055030400,14,687,4.333333333333333

The 1988 release was not only a superior performance for Quinn, but was also better directed with an incredibly emotional and haunting score. It's surprising that not many people know of this earlier release. Sadly, there seems to be no available soundtrack to the 1988 release of Crusoe.

I always thought Crusoe was English not Scottish, and when did he ever kill some one in Scotland? And bodies never washed up on the shore in the book.

1344304,5,B00004RYBN,"What can I say? I liked this movie. This is the story of Robinson Crusoe, a shipwrecked Scottish noble. (Okay, I admit it, I read the original book, but I've completely forgotten most of it, it was a little over 15 years ago).
I found this book to be quite nice, even without the literary comparison. Brosnan plays a character well entrenched in the ways of his time. He is in self-imposed exile, traveling from place to place, until misfortune in the form of a shipwreck leaves him abandoned on a deserted island with only a dog for companionship.
Eventually befriending a native, (Friday) Crusoe learns crucial lessons on what it means to be a human being, and alters his perceptions on slavery and the human condition.
Overall, despite a few peccadilloes (Brosnan's Scottish accent was sometimes a little 'slurred') I quite enjoyed this movie. I recommend it for anyone who likes Pierce and can overlook the fact that it doesn't follow the book to the letter.",1015545600,19,962,4.766467065868263

1344306,4,B00004RYBN,"I was anxious to see this DVD, and am glad that it came out. A fun side note, though I am an Anglo-American, I grew up in a village in Papua New Guinea, the country where some of the movie was filmed.  My parents are linguists, and I was raised speaking both English and Nasioi.  I had heard that William Takaku, who plays Friday, was a New Guinean, but out of the 1000 languages spoken in that nation, I had no idea that he was from my language group!  How exciting to understand every word that he spoke in Nasioi!  He did a great job!  Congratulations William.
 Although it bears little resemblance to DeFoe's original, there is little room in our world now for Colonialism, and though I regret that Friday kept his religion, I am grateful for the dignity by which he was treated.  I especially appreciated how they showed him to be physically an equal and in some ways a superior to Robinson. Having grown up in PNG, and living in both cultures, I actually thought they gave Crusoe much more physical strength and endurance than I would have, in comparison to the strength of the locals.  (o:  I appreciated so much that Friday did not speak gibberish, and that, despite his early desire to eat the heart of his enemy to gain his enemy's strength, he acted with dignity throughout the rest of the movie.
  I did think the DOG was the weak point of the movie.  No dog that pampered could have survived catching his own food, and even if he had found food, he would never have looked so glossy and healthy in a tropical climate.  (o:  I also found that the dog didn't play enough of an important role to warrant Crusoe's grief over his death, or over the desecration of his grave.  (o:",1013817600,7,1687,4.396774193548387

1344343,1,B00004RYBN,"I don't know where to begin. I had to stop watching this movie 55 minutes into it. If you want to watch a movie about a man stranded on an island who adapts to his surroundings and meets cannibals, then watch this movie. However, if you want to watch a movie that is remotely close to the theme of Daniel Defoe's ""Robinson Crusoe"", please go somewhere else. It is akin to watching ""Finding Nemo"" and calling it an adaptation of ""Moby Dick"". ""Robinson Crusoe"" was penned in 1651, the narrative and characters in the book reflect the culture and social mores of the time in which it was written. This movie however reflects the PC nature of modern Hollywood.",1359158400,8,656,4.5210084033613445
1344344,3,B00004RYBN,"Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, 1996 film

The story begins in 18th century Great Britain. A manuscript is read. It starts with a duel ni 1703 Scotland over the love and marriage to a woman. One man is killed. ""Murderer!"" Robinson Crusoe flees to avoid revenge from the dead man's relatives. [No mention of the law.] A ship will take him across the ocean and away from Scotland. A storm in the South Pacific causes the ship to crash upon the rocks. Crusoe alone survived. He buried the bodies. Then he boarded the ship to recover the supplies. He found black powder and arms, and carpenter's tools. He explored the island and found it deserted. Months passed. A ship passes but does not stop. Later he discovers a footprint on the beach! He arms himself and watches murderous rites performed by savages. He shoots a few and they run off. One captive escapes. Communication is difficult.

Crusoe defends himself against attackers. [Why didn't his dog warn him?] While walking Crusoe is caught in a trap! He escapes after a while. He shoots a bat in the trees. A thrown stick works as well. Friday is taken into his home, but is not trusted at first. Friday knew a lot about raising crops and learned to speak English to explain his culture. Can they cooperate? What if the other savages returned in force? [Was that a waste of scarce gunpowder?] Friday knows about the danger from white men (they are greedy). Crusoe wants to build a boat and leave the island. He fashions the trunk of a tree into a dugout canoe. [Is it seaworthy? Not without an outrigger to stabilize it.] There is a strong storm. They prepare for a new attack at the time of the full moon. The primitive traps work. But Crusoe is wounded by an arrow. He dreams of the past.

The recovered boat is filled with a sail and they steer for Friday's people on a remote island. Crusoe's wounds are treated. There will be a trial by combat to decide their fate. A shot from a white man ends this duel. These Europeans burn the village and enslave the natives. Crusoe is brought to Lisbon, then her returns to England after six years to write his story. He returned to his love and found nothing changed. He married and started a family. [Why did that woman wait if they thought he was dead?]

I never read Defoe's novel so I can't judge how well this followed the book. It is an interesting story as it seems changed. Did Defoe mean to criticize his society by contrasting it to a primitive island? Note that Friday's people are threatened from enemies who are both near and far away.",1352505600,,2545,4.51409978308026

1344348,1,B00004RYBN,I think others have summed it up quite well. I'm just adding this to have some impact on a scoring which has been defined by the puerile reviews of those unfamiliar with the works of Defoe. Maybe if this movie had been titled 'boring adventure on an island involving more PC feel good moments for the racially concerned' instead of usurping the title of a great novel I could feel otherwise.,1297728000,5,391,4.52112676056338
1344349,5,B00004RYBN,"Having read the actual book ""Robinson Crusoe"" I can admit that this movie does not follow the book; it doesn't even come close to it. But you know what? Who cares! I understand that people who are faithful to the 1700's book Robinson Crusoe will give this movie bad reviews because of how different it is from the book but I don't care. A movie is a movie and a book is a book. There are books with the same names as movies but don't have the same plot, so what of it?

This movie is just a pure gem. The main character, Crusoe, needs to go through some serious anger management. Poor ol' Friday didn't deserve half of the tongue he got! Either way, I am sure that if this story were true it would pan out in a similar order as to what happened in this movie; especially the part on God.

""Friday, you can't worship a crocodile!"" HAHAHA. This movie is great. It has humor in certain small parts, but mainly it is a drama. I cried at the end...I will admit it. Don't take my word on the theme, though. I thought Peter Pan was a comedy when I saw it in a drama theater. It turns out that it was a deep and dark drama. :-/!

I knew nothing about the story other than it was about a guy stranded on an island who met a ""savage"" he named Friday. Because of this I had no real expectations from the start and I found the movie captivating. I was never bored, I thought the acting was good. (The one bad part was the ""goof"" in the sunset scene after the storm where you could see a ""no swimming"" sign and white painted palms on the beach.) Ooops!

1344351,4,B00004RYBN,"Robinson Crusoe starring Pierce Brosnan as our hero, is a good film adaptation overall that I would recommend.  It is almost entirely without nudity (one brief scene, Crusoe's girl from behind) and it hits a lot of the points about the book that make it a useful educational tool such as how Crusoe got his supplies off the wrecked ship, built his ""castle"", fought cannibals and lived his life.  The movie does go places the book by Daniel Defoe never goes, such as a conflict with Crusoe and Friday over religion (Friday becomes a Christian in the book).  Also the reason for Crusoe's exile is a duel about the above mentioned woman, and that is nowhere in the book.  The film should be used educationally only if the the original story is also covered so a comparison can be made.  Ideally, a modern film more faithful to the original could someday be made.  Until then, this film does a good job.",1277337600,3,899,4.552795031055901

1344353,2,B00004RYBN,"I am and have always been a fan of tales of high adventure, and Robinson Crusoe has a distinguished place on my bookshelf. This 300 year old book's impact on the world is such that even someone who has no knowledge of the original work will likely be able to tell a modest account of the story.

Despite this I have to admit to have never seen a screen adaptation of the book, although I'm aware of some that do exist. The theme is a popular one that appeals to many. Take a ""civilized"" human and place them alone on a deserted island and watch how they tackle survival. The reality show ""Survivor"" plays upon this idea for success, and even the TV show Lost relies on a simplified formula for this to achieve its popularity. Let's face it, most of us are adventurers at heart and the story of Robinson Crusoe is one which speaks to the heart in a way few other tales can.

So when I saw that there was a modern telling of the story starring Pierce Brosnan I have to admit to being excited. After just under two hours of watching I will say that I was extremely disappointed with the experience for a host of reasons. I'm not opposed to modifying books to portray them as movies, and I understand that sometimes this is necessary to condense the plot so that the producers can fit large books into a 2 hour time frame. But some of the changes to this film come across as flights of fancy on the parts of the filmmakers, and I'm trying to figure out what exactly they were thinking here. Here's some changes from the source material...

- Crusoe (Brosnan) is a wealthy Scottish nobleman who goes on his trip around the world as the result of defeating/killing his best friend (played by Damien Lewis, whom most folks will recognize as Lt. Dick Winters from Band of Brothers).

- Crusoe has a love interest, who turns out to be the reason for the duel. She forms the basis for the reason he wishes to return to Scotland.

- Crusoe salvages very little from the ship he's a passenger on. While this may seem nitpicky bear in mind that much of the improvements the book version of Crusoe makes are made from implements scoured from the ship, including large sections of the ship itself. In the movie version he gets a couple of odds and ends and the final state of the ship remains unseen.

- Crusoe (movie version) is on the island for a scant 5-6 years, which pales in comparison to his book counterpart who spends almost 3 decades there.

- There are hints of movie Crusoe using his technical 18th century know-how to improve life on the island, but they remain that; hints. Book Crusoe's use of technology and good old-fashioned trial and error is half of the fun of the book. This hurts the film terribly.

- Movie Crusoe is really kind of a butthead, which I suppose is meant to juxtapose with the ""noble savage"" portrayal of Friday. This is a direct example of the PC element of movie where mean, forceful Anglo-Saxon White Males enforce brute will against the serene and peaceable cannibal natives. This element rubbed me the wrong way.

- The Pit Fighter scene. Nuff' said.

I really hate when movie producers have to project their own perceived modern sensibilities upon classic tales from the past, forgetting that life was quite different back in the portrayed time periods. This is especially evident in the ham-handed manner in which Brosnan tries to portray Christianity to Friday for the first time. I'm a Christian and even I wanted to yell at movie Crusoe for being so brutish in his attempts to ""evangelize"" to his new friend. On the other hand Friday was portrayed in a much better light and I rather enjoyed the performance given by the actor who played him. It is solely because of that facet and the beautiful location shots that I'm giving this movie two stars in lieu of one.

Again, I'm not one to nitpick a movie to death for not following the source book to the letter, but in this case the filmmakers chose to replace much of what made the book enjoyable (Crusoe's using knowledge, ingenuity, and creativity to survive) and placed a Humanist morality tale in it instead, and the film suffers for it horribly. If this kind of thing appeals to you I suspect you'll find this cinematic offering to be quite enjoyable. If you're a fan of High Adventure and surviving against the odds you'll likely feel great disapointment in this film.",1262131200,21,4357,4.516497461928934
1344354,4,B00004RYBN,"When I first considered buying this movie I was hesitant due to the fact that it had been remade so many times. However, I bought it anyway being curious about the change of acting venue for Pierce Brosnan. I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised. I have watched it more than once and enjoy it more each time. While this is not typical of the Pierce Brosnan we know, ie James Bond type. It is a well done movie that the whole family can enjoy together. Of course it is not exactly true to the book, but then no movie is that I know of. Robinson Crusoe, is a story, just that and enjoyable to watch. To see Mr. Brosnan in another realm of acting is great, he shows his numerous talents throughout.

1344357,5,B00004RYBN,"I am sure Daniel Defoe would spin in his grave if he knew there were so many people so fanatic about his book they would crucify any movie titled after his book that did not follow his book to the letter and be many hours long and bore people to death. Consider this movie is more likely to get people to either read the book or to reread it. Keep in mind after all any movie that followed the book in detail would be longer than all three Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings movies together. Now that might be a good thing, but consider Peter Jackson did not follow J.R.R. Tolkien's books exactly. Somehow though either he is forgiven, or there are so many fans of the LOTR movies, the book readers figure they better keep there mouths shut about critical summations or they might wish they had.

I suggest to anyone if they want to see an adventure movie that tries to convey some of the hardships that Defoe told of in his book, be sure to rent this. I think you will find the Brosnan is good and the production and story don't damage Mr. Defoe's reputation. I don't see to many decent versions of this story unfortunately and I consider this to be one of the better ones.

1344361,1,B00004RYBN,"This `Robinson Crusoe' film stars handsome Pierce Brosnan, but though it was shot in 1994, it remained on the shelf for more than three years before finally released straight-to-video in America  The film is distributed by Miramax, one of the powerful studios in Hollywood, but few people have heard about it. And TWO directors were attached to the project - Rodney K. Hardy and George Miller, the latter being the one who directed `Never Ending Story 2,' no, not the Australian director who did `Mad Max.'

The film's history suggests something very awful. The fact is, `Robinson Crusoe' is not as awful as you might think it is, but it is still awful all the same. Not that it is boring. It has lots of actions - a Scotsman dueling his best friend, a shipwreck, meeting with a native, fighting against the tribesmen, etc. -- but the storytelling of the entire film is so flat that the film looks as if being cut, edited, and put together by computer software. Crusoe's adventures are all on autopilot, allowing very few moments to make us care the hero and his friend Friday.

The back cover of my VHS of the film reads `SWEEPING ACTION AND HIGH ADVENTURE!' `BARABARIC SACRIFICAL RITUALS!' `SAVE A DOOMED TRIBESMAN FROM CERTAIN DEATH!' `SURVIVE AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS!' And look at these phrases with exclamation marks added to each of them. Yes, all of them surely happen in the film, but none of them is as thrilling as these four exclamation marks suggest. Even a dog appears to share the adventures with Crusoe, but the subplot about poor pooch ends up with a very misguided (and poorly done) conclusion which will leave you speechless.

Brosnan is a decent actor, and he is OK here (though his Scottish accent comes and goes), but more impressive is William Takaku as Friday. The supporting actors are Polly Walker (about 5 minutes), James Frain (about 1 minute), and Ian Hart (about 1 minute). Sean Brosnan, son of the star, briefly appears as cabin boy.

So, after all, what can you expect from a filmed version of `Robinson Crusoe'? You think you know the story, and probably have read the original book of Daniel Dafoe when you are a child. Whatever your memory might be, the film must have adventures, and lots of them. This film attempts to show as many as it can, but none of them is exciting as it should be.",1134777600,9,2324,4.658536585365853
1344362,1,B00004RYBN,"I am a big fan of Robinson Crusoe, but then these stupid movie people have to go and screw it up!!!!  I mean dang, he was supposed to be on the island for 28 years but they changed it all up so that he is only there for 6!!!!!?? Whoever reads this, DO NOT SEE IT IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!  Also they did not include him living in a cave and having a home in the country and a farm in the Brazils.  They did not show how he was able to plant stuff or how he go the goats and sheep that he survied on.  Friday was also a ripoff, in the book he was more tanned than African American.  And if you notice in the movie he had a toucan but in the book he had a parrot that he taught to speak to him.  And more about Friday, he had converted his religion to Christianity but he kept his religion.  Now all i have to say is that if Amazon had -5stars i would pick that.",1105574400,9,860,3.718232044198895
1344363,1,B00004RYBN,"I'm still trying to figure out how they got away with calling this movie ""robinson crusoe"".  It has few similarities to the book.  If you enjoyed the book, do not watch this movie.  It just made me angry.
I'm usually not one to be like ""oh the book is way better than the movie"", but in this case the movie leaves out massive detail and makes up things that never even happened in the book.
Here is an example:
Book-- Crusoe on island for 28 years
Movie-- 6 years.",1089676800,13,464,4.191011235955056

7921494,5,B00004RYBN,"I've no idea why this lovely film received such ridiculously low rating. Perhaps most of the critics are disappointed because the script does not follow faithfully the book. Well, it doesn't have to. During the opening credits it is stated that the film is based on the ""Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"". If that is of any consolation, I can tell you that the original novel, which was published on 25 April 1719, had run thru 4 editions by the end of the year and that by the end of the 19th century it had many more editions, spin-offs and translations. To date there are more than 700 alternative versions of it! (Check Wikipedia)
So, to those who wrote that Daniel Dafoe would turn in his grave if he could see the film - do not worry about that, he wouldn't!

The script writers Christopher Lofton, Tracy Keenan Wynn and Christopher Canaan have done a fine job modernizing the novel and compressing it to fit the story in a 90 min. screenplay. The romance is beautiful and adds nice, elegant touch to the plot.

It's 1703, Scotland. Robinson Crusoe is forced to duel a friend, Patrick O'Conner over his childhood sweetheart. The duel ends with Patrick's death and Robinson must flee the country. He sets off on a year long sea voyage. An ocean storm wrecks his ship and leaves him stranded on an uninhabited island. It's a matter of survival for him and his only companion, the late captain's dog Skipper, until he meets Friday, a tribesman whom he saves from being sacrificed. The two men struggle at first, but gradually manage to build strong bond despite their cultural and religious differences.

The plot is complex. I find it thought provoking and inspirational. The soundtrack is lovely, the cinematography beautiful. To me, the highlight in the film is the superb acting by both Pierce Brosnan (Robinson Crusoe) and William Takaku (Friday). Their final scene, once again a forced fight between friends, will stay with me for the rest of my life. It is so emotionally charged and so deeply moving.

Robinson Crusoe (1997) is a great, little film. It is worth the attention of everyone who appreciates fine cinema and great storytelling. And perhaps it is so brutally underrated because it came nearly 2 decades ahead of its time - nowadays, when the world is on a verge of new war because of religious and cultural intolerance, its message is more valid than ever!",1473379200,,2375,4.729468599033816
