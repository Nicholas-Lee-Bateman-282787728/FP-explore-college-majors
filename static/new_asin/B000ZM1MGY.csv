3042826,5,B000ZM1MGY,Great for toddlers.,1438473600,,19,5.666666666666667
3042827,5,B000ZM1MGY,"The 2 year old I bought this for loves it. I baby sit once a week and the toddle loves animals so I decided to order this DVD/CD. He will ask to have it put on just about as soon as he is in the door. It keeps his interest to watch it and we can talk about the different animals. He loves the songs and they play just about the entire time he is here. I find myself playing the songs in my head for hours afterwards. Not a bad thing of course. When you get older you forget how many times your own kids watched their favorite VCR tapes over and over. Quality on both are good, very cute catchy songs so I would recommend it",1385078400,,623,3.875
3042828,5,B000ZM1MGY,the kids just loved theses and our granbabies are enjoying these so much im sure i will purchase more in the near future,1379808000,,120,4.260869565217392
3042829,4,B000ZM1MGY,The item was shipped and received on time with no damage. It was a gift for my granddaughter. She liked it but didn't love it.,1378080000,,126,4.08
3042830,3,B000ZM1MGY,"I bought this baby genius for my toddler and baby (at the time 18 months and 3 months) after seeing that they loved the Baby Genius Favorite Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children's Songs.  This one never became a favorite.  It had some cute animals which my children enjoyed, but they never enjoyed the songs enough to sing along with like with the other dvds.  Fine, but  I would recommend other baby genius dvds over this one.",1378080000,,427,4.578947368421052
3042831,5,B000ZM1MGY,"I bought this DVD for my 2 years old granddaughter, and she loves it!  Elephant, Lion, Monkey, Polar bear, ect..  She has to watch the DVD almost every day. She also likes to dance with the music (a music CD comes with it) when she is not around the DVD player.  Over all this is one of the best products I bought for my granddaughter.",1316908800,,335,4.123076923076923
3042832,4,B000ZM1MGY,"I first saw some video clips of Baby Genius videos on the free section of my OnDemand.  My daughter absolutely loved them and asked for them all the time.  So, I purchased three different ones.  This video is a little different than the other two I got (San Diego Zoo and Underwater Adventures) because they play classical music in the background.  This video has pretty simple songs that go along with each type of baby animal.  As an adult, I find the songs a little silly but easy to remember and sing along with.  The main point is that my daughter enjoys them quite a bit!",1292284800,,577,4.39622641509434
3042833,4,B000ZM1MGY,"My 22 month-old really enjoys all the video of the zoo animals. There are many close-up shots and a large variety of animals. This video is mostly shots of the animals with some overlay of the Baby Genius cartoon characters- not the quick switching back and forth between real and cartoon images of the Favorite Songs video- a quality that I think improves this video.
The songs however are not quite enjoyable or memorable- only one has stuck in my head. They consist of verses about the animals set to popular children's tunes- not bad, but not astoundingly great. The worth of this video is in the videos of the animals.  If your child, like mine, is in love with all animals I would recommend this DVD.",1285113600,,706,4.559055118110236
3042834,5,B000ZM1MGY,"I bought this for my grandkids.  We all watch it together. Very educational and they never get bored.  They sing right along with the songs. Use to get it on television but it was taken off air, could not find it in the stores anywhere.  I was so happy to find it here It arrived faster than I expected and in excellent condition.",1266710400,3,330,4.2063492063492065
3042835,5,B000ZM1MGY,"I don't think the title or cover does any justice to this very entertaining zoo DVD. We got it for our 2 year old granddaughter and watching it makes you feel like you're at the zoo. The little songs grow on you, and you do end up singing-a-long. We actually enjoy having it on in the background.",1229040000,8,296,4.2105263157894735

8235992,3,B000ZM1MGY,"My 17 month old likes this. She dances to the songs and likes to point at the animals, and it keeps her attention pretty good. But i think it's awful. It's super cheesy and annoying. So it's good to put on if you're doing a chore and need your child's attention elsewhere, but it's not good if you have to sit in the same room and actually watch it. For watching tv together, Sesame Street is the way to go! Its entertaining for parents and kids, and it's free ",1499472000,,461,4.179775280898877
