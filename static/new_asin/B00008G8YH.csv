1845892,3,B00008G8YH,"Alright, this movie started out as a straight-forward sci-fi epic about the first ship on venus. Filmed in eastern europe (I've heard it was made in hungary, poland, czechaslovachia, and / or russia; take your pick) in 1963 or so, Roger Corman got a hold of it, brought it to america, and ""fixed"" the film for american audiences. Some ""dull"" scenes were removed and scenes with Faith Demergue (floating in a spacestation) and Basil Rathbone (at a moonbase) were added. Both performers seem as bored as they are boring. This ""new"" movie was called VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET. Next, in about 1967, Corman removed the Demergue / Rathbone scenes, turned over the camera to Derek Thomas (aka: a young Peter Bogdanovich), and inserted Mamie Van Doran and a host of scantilly-clad uber babes. Thus, the confoundingly confusing mess, VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN was born! Instead of a venusian adventure, it's a playboy bunny sunbathing contest, with a few astronauts and a robot running around! Unfortunately, there's a load of unnecessary narration in this one that's only slightly less painful than swallowing a porcupine. I'm not really complaining. I mean, I enjoy this type of hyper-schlock. If you like babes in seashell bras (and who doesn't), then this one's for you...",1068336000,9,1290,5.0327102803738315

All other prints of this film I have seen have this dialogue complete, so I don't see why they couldn't have fixed this from another print.

As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc released by AIP-TV. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 2, Side B, second feature - VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN (1968), starring Mamie Van Doren, Mary Marr, and Paige Lee.  Directed by Peter Bogdanovich.

Wouldn't it be a great gag if some studio were to put out a film called VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN, and when the intrepid space crew touches down, Joan Rivers, Madeline Albright and Phyllis Diller came out to meet them?  Well, maybe not - maybe a gag for a spoof film to exploit.  In any case, we don't get Phyllis or Madeline, instead we get a gaggle of beautiful but indistinguishable women led by Mamie Van Doren - who really is quite sultry in this film.  These women live a rather idyllic existence on the beaches of Venus, telepathically communicating with one another, swimming around in the surf, and searching for the right size clam shells to use as bra cups.  But when two teams of astronauts land on the planet, they disrupt this layabout life when they inadvertently kill a big rubber pterodactyl that they women had worshipped as a god.  Hell hath no fury like a woman with a dead pterodactyl, so the beach beauties use their mental powers to try and kill the visitors, but only succeed in chasing them away...for the moment.  Disillusioned, the women reject their old beliefs, since they were ineffective, and set their sights on new, more powerful methods.

Other reviewers have mentioned that this film is a sort of collage - it is made up of elements of a Soviet film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planeta-Bur-Planet-of-Storms/dp/B000CBQHYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planeta Bur / Planet of Storms</a>&nbsp;filmed in 1962, intercut with footage filmed in '68 with Van Doren et al, to make a composite drive-in flick.  Did I mention that Mamie Van Doren is really hot in this film?  That's your best reason to seek this out, especially if your a fan of low budget science-fiction films already.  I haven't seen it, but reviews for the original film, PLANETA BUR, are much more positive than they are for this one, or for the OTHER composite film that was made from this footage,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-to-the-Prehistoric-Planet/dp/B00008ZL5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet</a>&nbsp;- so if it's ONLY science fiction you're interested in, you might want to skip this and go directly to Venus courtesy of the Soviets, rather than Roger Corman and Peter Bogdanovitch (yes, THAT Peter Bogdanovitch.)

On the other hand, Mamie Van Doren is downright sexy in this film, even when, at the end, they crown her with the chef's hat that indicates...well, I'm not sure what it indicates.  That she's queen of Venus, I guess.  High priestess and chief cook and bottle washer.  The other women all remind me of a cross between Led Zepplin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Houses-Of-The-Holy/dp/B000002J0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Houses Of The Holy</a>&nbsp;album cover and hippy-dippy flower children.  They're all attractive, but there's a sense about them - probably cultivated, but probably part natural as well - that there was a lot of pot-smoking going on between filming.

But potential viewers should also know that (besides the fact that no boobs were shown in the making of this film) the scenes with the women are really only a small part of the movie.  We see far more of the cosmonauts - one team of two men land with a Robbie the Robot clone, but they run into trouble right off the bat (and some great lizard creatures).  Another team of three come to rescue them, and though they all suspect that there is other life on Venus, they never meet the women who are trying to destroy them.

I watch a lot of this type of cornball stuff, so my criteria for enjoying something like VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN is probably going to be different than someone more used to mainstream films.

1845964,2,B00008G8YH,"""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" is a science fiction movie about a group of astronauts stranded on Venus together with their humanoid robot. They are eventually joined by a rescue mission. Together, the two groups decide to explore Venus, which turns out to be a prehistoric world with lush tropical climate. Man-eating plants, pterosaurs and some kind of miniature tyrannosaurs lurk in the swamps or in the humid air. More ominously, Venus is inhabited by an all-female tribe of telepathic heathens, who worship the pterosaur as their god. The Amazon women (who look like photo models) have the power to cause volcanic eruptions and rain storms, powers they turn against the astronauts. The intruders made the mistake of downing and killing the divine pterosaur! When the astronauts get away, the Venusians stone their pterosaur idol and begin to worship the humanoid robot instead. (Or what's left of it - it seems John wasn't fire or water proof!)

The movie is really a remake of a remake. The original version, ""Planet Bur"", was Soviet (sic). Later, it was turned into an American film, titled ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"". Adding a tribe of lovely babes-on-the-beach, the third version (this one) was born. With the exception of the females, much of the footage is identical in the three versions.

Although ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" isn't an outright turkey in my opinion, it's nevertheless too boring, dragging and uninteresting. Not even the paranormally beautiful Venusians can save it. Had it been shorter, I suppose it could have worked as a children's show, LOL.

1845969,2,B00008G8YH,"In 1965, Roger Corman and a small gang of others took a Soviet movie, added some scenes with Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue, and created a reasonably serviceable science fiction movie titled ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.""  There were some strange moments and a few funny moments, but the movie was a reasonably campy, low-budget science fiction film.  Apparently, someone decided the movie was insufficiently schlocky and gave it one more shot.

As an interesting historical note, this movie was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who three years later would direct ""The Last Picture Show,"" launching Bogdanovich's real career as an award-winning director.

In the original movie, we saw two groups of men wandering around Venus.  The first group crashed and is trying find the second group of men so that the second group of men can rescue the first group of men.  As both groups wander around they encounter a cheesy looking reptilian bird, a deluge, and an erupting volcano.  In this movie producer Roger Corman and Director Bogdanovich provide an explanation for these happenings; an explanation that probably would have been better left unexplained.

It turns out that there were a bunch of blond Barbie clones wandering the planet with telepathic powers and excessive chest development.  These women, who spend a lot of time lying around with 60s-looking pants and shell tops, walk around acting like a coven of witches with too much makeup, false eyelashes, and too little in the way of prehistoric attributes.  Their hair is, of course, perfectly in place, in spite of the fact that they spend a lot of time in the sea.  Mamie Van Doren, one of the three M's of the 50s and 60s (Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe included), is the leader of the Venusian blonde babes, who include a cluster of women who may have been so embarrassed by this movie that most of them never appeared in a film again.

The movie switches between the men and the women, who (a rare-for me-plot spoiler here!) never meet each other.  The women perform some mumbo-jumbo ritual, and some catastrophe hits the men.  I was wondering in ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" why all these things happened right at that particular moment.

This movie was completely unnecessary.  If ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" was unbelievable (as an aside, I thought that movie had some interesting moments, but I admit to being a hardcore science fiction fan), this movie is pure fantasy.  I am sure director Peter Bogdanovich looks back on his first feature (if you can call it a feature) film with some fondness as well as with some embarrassment.  If you buy this turkey, be sure you have your sense of humor handy.

This movie was also titled ""The Gill Women"" and ""The Gill Women of Venus,"" though gills were never evident to my disbelieving eyes.  Now you have three movie titles to avoid.  Let us hope no one ever gets the idea to remake this thing.

Good luck!",1339718400,,2940,4.849699398797595
1845970,2,B00008G8YH,"No CGI here. When I saw the image Amazon had up for the title, I thought it looked like it was made in the 50's or 60's, and was maybe Russian or Japanese. After watching the movie, I was able to find out more about it, and indeed, it includes footage from Russian movies, and in fact was made in the 1960's (though Amazon says 2005).

The movie itself is seriously washed out of color, and appears black and white in most cases. It's a shame, I think with vibrant colors it would be a whole different film. The models of the spaceships, especially at the beginning, are great. I loved it. Cool ""60's style ships. And the hover car is a hoot to see today, though I am sure it was pretty cool when the film was made.  There is even a (very) large robot in the film.

The women are pretty enough, but their role is not as large as you would think. And as I mentioned, the washed colors and poor copy of the film leaves a lot to be desired.

So, if you like old scifi movies, despite any lack of a real story, this would be a good film to watch at least once. I gave it two stars because I just thought the models and effects were well done.

1846016,4,B00008G8YH,"Although primitive and low-budget by modern standards, VTTPOPW is worth a watch, especially for fans of this sort of cinema.

This film was originally a 1962 Soviet release that was bought by a U.S. producer and then given to apprentice auteur Peter Bogdonavich to pad and repackage for U.S. consumption. As such, it is much less awkward a film than one would expect. There is continuity in the overall sound quality, in certain sonic elements, and in the element of water that smooths over the schisms, and for some inexplicable reason there is a certain otherworldly mood that prevails.

The cool science fiction elements such as the robot and the hovercar come exclusively from the Soviet film, and are generally more impressive than the kind of stuff you would have seen in a 1962 U.S. scifi film. The original film also establishes Venus as a moody, damp, cloudy place, and provides the original 'singing' background track.

The blond bombshells were added by the U.S. director, and although they should be silly, nonetheless seem to be plausible, mysterious and telepathic, just beyond the detection of the cosmonauts, with their hotpants and bare midriffs.

This is a tale of hapless group of men, lonely, struggling for survival, absolutely clueless as to the sense-shattering beauties just beyond, and the impossibly stunning maidens, led by goddess Mamie Van Doren, oblivious to their world's invasion. There is obviously a commentary on the male and female conditions within this scenario.",1276905600,3,1500,5.135245901639344

I actually know one of the actresses because she was my high school history teacher.  That's right, the actress credited as Irene Orton (the one who bites into the fish) is now a history teacher.  She was working as a model at the time and got paid like a hundred bucks to act in the film.

The plot is nonsense of course.  A rocket from Earth arrives on Venus to explore.  Many of the shots were stock footage of an earlier Soviet film, but in Bogdanovich's early hands, one does not see an iota of the genius that he would later show.  The women are mostly blonde busty beauties who communicate telepathically.  When they realize that their pterodactyl god is less powerful than a Robby the Robot type from earth, they gladly switch allegiance.  This film takes itself too seriously for viewers to see any traces of camp.  The sight of Miss Van Doren in sea shell bras and hip hugging capris palls pretty quickly.

It's more realistic than breaking Wilt the Stilt's record (no, silly, not the 100 points...) or dropping acid and running around the State Department scaring foreign diplomats. I doubt I'll ever even have a panda bear as a pet. So I figure this one's my best shot, have at it. This particular film is a recut version of ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"", itself a recut and dubbed version of a Russian flick called ""Storm Planet"". Now, ""Storm Planet"" or ""Planeta Bur"" is supposed to be good, but I can't say for sure, never having seen it. What Bogdonavich does here is the old Roger Corman trick of using a narrator (himself in this case) to make sense of, well, a story with holes big enough to drive a convoy of Hummers through. Basically, two cosmonauts and a robot crash on Venus. A second group of three cosmonauts is deployed to rescue them. Venus, it seems, is similar to prehistoric Earth, with dinosaurs and men in rubber lizard suits. Oh, and telepathic  mer-woman in bellbottoms who worship a rubber pterodactyl that looks to have been bought at Family Dollar. Problems arise when the cosmonauts kill said dollar store rubber pterodactyl vis a vis the fact that said Venusian mer women worship him. Not to worry, soon they find a new idol...the robot, who is junked by volcanic lava. You a witty person, with witty friends, who likes to drink? Really? Me too. You may just enjoy this film with company then. Might I suggest the Tree Line Sci-Fi 50 film pack, which contains both ""Voyage"" films, instead of blowing a third of the price on just one movie? Yes indeedy.",1144022400,3,1710,4.625
1846021,2,B00008G8YH,"In 1965 Roger Corman and a small gang of others took a Soviet movie, added some scenes with Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue, and created a reasonably serviceable science fiction movie titled ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.""  There were some strange moments and a few funny moments, but the movie was a reasonably campy, low-budget science fiction film.  Apparently someone (Corman perhaps) decided the movie was insufficiently schlocky and gave it one more shot.

In the original movie we see two groups of men wandering around Venus.  The first group crashed and is trying to get rescued.  The second group of men is trying to find the first group of men.  As both groups wander around they encounter a cheesy looking reptilian bird, a deluge, and an erupting volcano.  In this movie Corman provides an explanation for these happenings; an explanation that probably would have been better left unexplained.

It turns out that there were a bunch of blond Barbie clones wandering the planet with telepathic powers and excessive chest development.  These women, who spend a lot of time lying around with 60s-looking pants and shell tops, walk around acting like a coven of witches with too much makeup, false eyelashes, and too little in the way of prehistoric attributes.  Their hair is, of course, perfectly styled, in spite of the fact that they spend a lot of time in the sea.  Mamie Van Doren, one of the three M's of the 50s and 60s (Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe included), is the leader of the Venusian blonde babes, who include a cluster of women who may have been so embarrassed by this movie that most of them never appeared in a film again.

The movie switches between the men and the women, who (a rare-for me-plot spoiler here!) never meet each other.  The women perform some mumbo-jumbo ritual, and some catastrophe hits the men.  I was wondering in ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" why all these things happened right at the particular moment.

This movie was completely unnecessary.  If ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" was unbelievable, this movie is pure fantasy.  I am sure director Peter Bogdanovich looks back on his first feature(?) film with some fondness as well as with some embarrassment.  If you buy this turkey be sure you have your sense of humor handy.

This movie was also titled ""The Gill Women"" and ""The Gill Women of Venus,"" though gills were never evident to my disbelieving eyes.  Now you have three movie titles to avoid.  Let's hope no one ever gets the idea to remake this thing.",1137888000,6,2531,4.825986078886311
1846022,2,B00008G8YH,"Now I like theatrical cheese as much as the next person, but this is a moldy piece of stinky gouda. This film is essentially a bunch of often-seen stock footage (most of which came from behind the Iron Curtain) shown in glorious sepia and white. The box says the film is in color, but the reality is generally otherwise. This is a real chore to get through even for devoted fans of bad movies.

The plot, as much of it as there is, concerns three groups of voyagers to Venus, who find giant man-eating flowers, pterodactyl-like flying things (the earlier reviewer was spot on in his comparison to ""The Giant Claw,"" which is, tragically, a much better movie), and the most ridiculous six foot tall tyrannosaurus creatures wrestling around in mud with astronauts (and a robot). About 35 minutes into the movie we finally see the women, headed up by Mamie Van Doren, who generally sing like Sirens, and incant for volcanic eruptions to thwart the intruding astronauts. The astronauts have particularly silly and incongruous equipment, especially their atomic powered flying car (that also doubles as a submarine), and are dubbed into English with some of the worst dialogue in film history.

The whole mess is narrated in flashback by one of the astronauts who, of course, is in love with a woman on Venus, and pines for her in a plot reminiscent of ""Nude on the Moon,"" which, even more tragically, is also a better movie than this.

For mind-numbing bad film exposure this is tough to beat, but I still give it two stars for the audacious compilation of film from so many sources into a finished work that almost makes sense. Watch it at your own risk, because only the strong survive.",1133740800,15,1683,4.698305084745763

7983607,5,B00008G8YH,"ONLY buy the DUB3 'Comic Book Collector's Edition' version. It is a pressed disk NOT burned like the others I tried.

There's probably a half dozen versions of this movie sold on Amazon. I tried many of them in order to get a decent copy.

Finally, I discovered the Comic Book 'Collector's Edition' version.  It is on a pressed disc and should last just about forever.  It looks like the authoring was done on a Mac as opposed to a DVD recorder.  This version includes chapter settings and a theatrical trailer.  Very good picture and sound.

Seeing this film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The cinematography has not aged at all. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of ' Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women'  is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is knowing we have seen 'THE MOVIE'.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that its a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.

To watch it, is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, and gotten away with them.
