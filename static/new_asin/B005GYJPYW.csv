4694348,5,B005GYJPYW,"Since I was born in England & not familiar with Captain America--I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I attended a special preview screening with a theater full of movie critics. The whole audience--critics included--thoroughly enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. It wasn't hard to root for scrawny Steve Rogers. He has a lot of heart. His transformation into Captain America & who he becomes was great to see. He embodies all that is good in American values. The action was great fun & very well done. It has it's lighter moments which I enjoyed & the rest of the audience did too. Of course we were all cheering Captain America on throughout the film. The rest of the cast were superb and spot on. A special nod to Hugo Weaving who played the Red Skull. He does evil so well! I've seen Chris Evans in other films, but this is his best role to date. He brought some real depth to his character.

I love Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk. And others to numerous to mention as well. But Captain America just became my favorite super hero.

I will definitely be adding this movie to my blu ray collection. Two generous thumbs up.",1311379200,,1149,4.466666666666667
4694349,5,B005GYJPYW,"It's crucial that you get to like Steve Rogers when he was only this 98-pound weakling, crucial that you grow to care for this runty, scrawny, asthmatic kid who persists in standing up for himself and for others, never mind that this usually rewards him with bruises and lumps. It's 1943, in wartime America, and Steve Rogers yearns to do his part, if the military would only allow him to. Five times he's tried to enlist only to be summarily rejected as 4F. Meanwhile, his best friend James ""Bucky"" Barnes is a sergeant in the U.S. Army, cutting a dashing figure, shining the ladies, bullying those who'd been bullying Steve. You note Steve's lack of resentment over this, and like him for it.

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is the one I'd been looking forward to the most this year, and I'm pleased as punch to say that this movie did not tank, that it in fact is fairly bloody brilliant. I enjoyed THOR and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, but CAPTAIN AMERICA is the best Marvel flick since IRON MAN and it gets you charged up for THE AVENGERS movie. Chris Evans - damn.

Steve Rogers's impassioned speech to Bucky is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine, a kindly German scientist working for the U.S. government. Dr. Erskine heads a top secret government program involving the creation of the super-soldier, and on these shores he's looking for a candidate to be his inaugural test subject (he'd had an earlier candidate elsewhere but that didn't work out so well; more on that in a bit). Dr. Erskine sees past Steve's sickly frame. He's intrigued with Steve's spirit. He gets him enlisted in the U.S. Army.

Compared to the rest of the film, the first third segment is less action-packed, but that doesn't equate to dull or slow. We track Steve Rogers' time in boot camp and we take in his struggles. He tires easy. He's always finishing last. The camp's gruff director, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, hogging all the good lines), is highly skeptical and takes Dr. Erskine to task for Rogers' presence. But we note Rogers' quiet diligence and doggedness, and these strong character moments provide the building blocks for making what happens to him later so resonating and gratifying.

If you're caught up on Marvel Comics continuity, then you're up to snuff on what happens next. Steve Rogers undergoes Erskine's treatment which galvanizes change on an awesome cellular scale. I think the best CG work done by the film's f/x crew, hands down, is in the shrinking and scrawnying of Chris Evans and making it look seamless. Steve Rogers as the beneficiary of the super-soldier serum is a picture in bold contrast, a foot taller and now rippling with muscles. But this is Chris Evans in real, the guy having worked his tail off to get this buff (even though Chris Hemsworth probably still points at him and smirks).

If you don't know your Captain America history, I'll just mention that an act of sabotage renders Steve Rogers the world's one and only super soldier. Which gets us to an inspired plot thread which isn't part of Captain America lore. And, fine, here's a ***SPOILERS alert*** for the rest of this paragraph. With Rogers the only one of his kind, Colonel Phillips has no use for him, and so Steve Rogers is deployed to USO tour appearances, putting on a show in the home front with chorus girls and shilling war bonds as the military mascot ""Captain America."" Like a good soldier, Steve goes along with it, but he wishes he could do more. We know that Cap will join the war soon enough, but, in the meantime, his time on stage just fills me with cinematic joy. I absolutely love that he gets his own awesome show jingle, ""Star Spangled Man,"" with music by Alan Menken. I also like how the film addresses the inherent cheesiness of the traditional Captain America costume, which is what he wears on these shows. Cap's later costume re-design would be more practical, less shiny, less tights.

Chris Evans inhabits his role with conviction, imbues Steve Rogers with spunk and an appealing sweetness, and I'm not worried any more about how he might hold up against Robert Downey, Jr. and Samuel Jackson in THE AVENGERS movie. He just proved to me that he can command the screen. Fine actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving add so much to the story. If you could point at the heart of the story, it may be the almost father-son relationship between Steve Rogers and Tucci's Dr. Erskine. Tucci isn't in the film much, but he leaves a defining mark. I was concerned about how the Red Skull would come off, but I should've known Hugo Weaving would make it work. His Nazi commandant, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. the Red Skull, is a convincing villain and, incidentally, a failed past test subject of Erskine's. As a guilty pleasure, I'm glad the biochemist Arnim Zola is here as well. Or, I dunno, maybe I'm fond of him because Ookla the Mok's ""Super Skrull"" song references him. (""He's endorsing RC Cola and cruising chicks with Arnim Zola."")

Parts of Steve's origin are snatched from Marvel's Ultimate universe (portraying Bucky as someone in Steve's age bracket, for one thing). For fans of Marvel's cinematic continuity, Dominic Cooper riffs Robert Downey, Jr. a bit as Tony Stark's rakish genius industrialist father, Howard Stark. I wish Hayley Atwell as British Agent Peggy Carter were given more to do, but I suspect Atwell will reappear in future films as Agent 13, Sharon Carter. And if you were expecting Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos to show up, you're sort of right. The action is terrific, and maybe it's terrific because the story had taken the time to invest in its lead character. These aren't just tatters of action sequences. There's a compelling thru arc to tie everything together.

But, okay, one thing nagged me. There's something jarringly anachronistic about the presence of Hydra and its super science. The strongest emotional impression I have to Cap is that he was a World War II hero who fought the Nazis and later became a tormented man-out-of-time. This movie removes the first part by replacing the Nazis with Hydra goons. And, although Hydra is supposed to be affiliated with them storm troopers - serving as Hitler's ""deep science division"" - it's not the same. ""Heil Hydra!"" just doesn't ring true. And Nazis always did make the best big bads.

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER gives it up with that old-fashioned wartime nostalgia, with a grip of strong performances, with an indomitable legend to whom Chris Evans does justice. This movie has heart. Nothing embodies that more than the sequence in which the new Steve Rogers is in pursuit of a spy who tries to distract him by tossing a boy into the drink. About to dive in the water, Steve hears the boy briskly yell at him: ""I can swim. Go get him!"" That bit of bravado from the kid generated the loudest cheers from the theater audience.

As per norm, stick around until after the closing credits. If what you see doesn't excite you... then you're probably executives over at DC Comics.",1311379200,3,7004,4.7383100902379
4694350,5,B005GYJPYW,"A good bit of this film is a superhero-origins story, in which we follow Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a plain-featured young man of about 20 years old who is a classic ""90-pound weakling,"" as he tries five times to enlist in the Army during the early part of World War II. He is consistently rated as ""4F"" because of his size and various health issues, including asthma. Inside that small, frail body, however, resides outsized courage, honor, loyalty and persistence. During Steve's fifth trip to the Army recruiters, those virtues in Steve draw the attention of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a German scientist who escaped the Nazis and is working on a top-secret program to develop super soldiers. Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), who is in charge of the program, wants to use a soldier who is bigger, stronger and has more training for the first human experiment with the Dr. Erskine's super-soldier formula, but the doctor strongly disagrees. He says the other soldier is a bully, but Steve is a good man. It is crucial that anyone receiving the formula be of good character, because the formula enhances the existing personality traits of whoever receives it. Steve would become even more of a good person, but a bully could become a villain.

The experiment is a success, but immediately after Steve is transformed into a handsome, ripped, perfect specimen of manhood, a Nazi spy assassinates Dr. Erskine and steals the formula. Though Steve manages to stop the assassin from escaping, in his first act of heroism as a newly minted superhero, the flask breaks in the process. Without a sample of the formula, it cannot be replicated because the doctor never wrote down the whole formula. Steve is now one of a kind. Unfortunately, the military can't think of anything to do with him other than turn him into a US-flag-wrapped peddler of war bonds appearing in USO shows with chorus girls, until Steve is sent abroad. He finds himself entertaining the recently decimated troops of Col. Phillips and is horrified to discover that his best friend James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been captured with 400 other Allied soldiers and is being held prisoner in a massively defended fortress deep in enemy lines. Col. Phillips insists he would lose far more men than he could save going after his captured men, and refuses to do anything. But the colonel's assistant, a female military officer, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), encourages Steve to fulfill his destiny as the super-soldier Dr. Erskine created him to be by staging a one-man rescue raid.

On every level this film is outstanding. It is directed by the talented Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumanji/dp/B000031EGV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumanji</a>&nbsp;). The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the writing team best known for the three&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chronicles of Narnia</a>&nbsp;films) is an excellent adaptation, staying true in every important way to the world of a comic-book icon with a 70-year history of stories in Marvel Comics since the Captain's first appearance in 1941.

All of the actors are terrific, but the star, Chris Evans (who played the comic-book superhero, Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in the two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B00005JNTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>&nbsp;films), is superb. Evans gives a depth and breadth to his performance that is remarkable for any genre, but especially for a superhero film. In his capable hands, Steve is endearingly humble, yet enduringly determined to have a chance to contribute to the worldwide struggle against the Nazis in the beginning, origins part of the film. And after the transformation, he compellingly presents Steve as a fascinating contradiction of a relentless, manly warrior who is still emotionally innocent and nave.

Steve's relationship with Peggy, as his romantic interest in the film, has significant barriers to their connection that makes it both amusing and exciting to watch. She is his superior officer and, for a young man who has barely even had a conversation with a woman before her, it takes more bravery than going to war for him to aspire to a relationship with a woman like Peggy. She is not only gorgeous, but a formidable warrior in her own right. What I found as intriguing as the romantic potential between these two, however, is the fact that they bring out the best in each other. Peggy gives Steve the inspiration to seize his destiny as a super-warrior when the colonel and other leaders have ordered him to sit out the war, and Steve's innate sensitivity and goodness soften the shell of cynicism Peggy has developed around her heart in the harsh, man's world of the Army.

The incredibly versatile Stanley Tucci (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, The Lovely Bones) is terrific as Dr. Erskine. Hugo Weaving (who played V in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-for-Vendetta/dp/B000FS9FCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V for Vendetta</a>&nbsp;and Agent Smith in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;movies) is his usual brilliant self as the villain Red Skull. Anytime he appears in anything it is a gift, but he is particularly skilled as a comic-book super villain. As for Tommy Lee Jones, he was simply made for the part of Colonel Chester Phillips. Sebastian Stan (Carter Baizen on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gossip-Girl/dp/B000W6ZUUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gossip Girl</a>) is a convincing choice as Bucky. He and Chris Evans have excellent buddy chemistry as best friends since childhood. All of the other supporting actors are great, too, including Neal McDonough (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traitor/dp/B0000ACOXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traitor</a>) as Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan, Derek Luke (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antwone-Fisher/dp/B00005JLRZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antwone Fisher</a>) as Gabe Jones, Kenneth Choi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Kings/dp/B001BP4K22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Kings</a>) as Jim Morita, and JJ Feild (Northanger Abbey) as James Montgomery Falsworth.

Finally, the special effects in the action scenes, aided by computer-generated imagery (CGI), are absolutely breathtaking, making this movie a must-see on the big screen. There is also one other CGI effect that I found awe-inspiring. The real, buffed Chris Evans is trimmed down via CGI to the pre-formula Steve.  ""It's pretty amazing,"" Evans told Reuters. ""They took shape out of my jaw line, they shrunk my skeleton, and they made my shoulders less broad.""  They certainly did. The skinny Steve has the body of a prepubescent boy. As for the actual physique of Chris Evans--he went through a specialized training program to put on 15 pounds of muscle on a physique that was already quite ripped.

Among the multiple feature films already done on the Captain, this should delight fans as a standout contribution.",1311292800,352,7585,6.087932647333957
4694351,5,B005GYJPYW,"I have never read a Captain America comic book. Never cared about the character. However, Captain America: The First Avenger is an excellent summer flick that reminds me of an interesting hybrid of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Rocketeer. Chris Evans does an awesome job here, Hugo Weaving is very cool as Red Skull, the action is the best ever seen in a Marvel movie, and the leading lady is gorgeous. This isn't Dark Knight good. Nor it is on par with X-men: First Class. But it is an exciting and charmingly old-fashioned escapist entertainment done in the retro style of a 1940's serial. Much better than that awful Harry Potter movie.",1311292800,3,637,4.646017699115045
4694352,5,B005GYJPYW,"This review is based on seeing the movie Theatrically, not from seeing it on DVD or Blu-Ray

So Captain America: The First Avenger is the last major comic book movie to come out this summer, and the studio system has certainly saved the best for last. Captain America: The First Avenger is filled with action and adventure, subtle romance, a villain that seems to be just pure evil, and one of the finer hero's journey stories. I saw the movie in 2D, because I read it wasn't worth seeing in 3D, and after seeing the film I didn't see anything where 3D would have added much to the experience of watching the film.

The cast was absolutely amazing, everyone played their part and didn't out shine anyone in terms of performance. Chris Evan signed on for nine films when he was cast Captain America. That was a great decision on the studio's part because he was spectacular in the role, a huge departure from his other Marvel based role of The Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films. He is able to capture pure good essence of the Captain America character without a factor of unbelievability that he is too good, and he comes off as relatable throughout the film.

Hayley Atwell plays the Captain's love interest, Peggy Carter, she plays a strong willed but still slightly vulnerable female lead. She's assertive and certainly has some attitude to her. It was great to see that they did not dumb down her character in the transition from comic book to film, because it is very easy to do that when making a movie set in the 1940s but the writers and director didn't do that at all.

My personal favorite performance of the film is Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull. When this casting was originally announced, I got excited because Weaving is great in every geek property he has a part in, whether it is The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, or V For Vendetta and now Captain America, he always turns in a stellar performance. The Red Skull for those who aren't familiar with the character is one of the more major villains in the Marvel universe, and one that doesn't compromise his agenda for anything, he is just pure evil and nothing less than that, and Hugo Weaving conveys just that as The Red Skull.

The one detail that I was a bit weary about going into this film was the director, Joe Johnston. For those who don't know, Joe Johnston early in his career. directred some awesome films such as The Rocketeer and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, while lately directing some films that were just terrible, The Wolfman (2010) and Jurassic Park III. But upon seeing Captain America: The First Avenger, Joe Johnston has regained his directorial touch he had while directing The Rocketeer, which makes me think he should just stick with directing movies that take place in the 1940s. The performances he was able to get out of the actors and choices in how to shoot scenes comes across as positive on screen. He deserves a good amount for the overall package of a movie he was able to put together.

In terms of the actual story and plot, without going into spoilers too much, the story of Steve Rogers becoming Captain America and going after the bad guys, was just really enjoyable, well paced, and just fun to watch. The love story between Peggy Carter and Captain America was subtle, didn't seem forced, and flowed really well into the overall plot of the film. The fight scenes were well shot. Never was the camera too tight on the action, which was a problem in the other Avengers movie this summer, Thor. And the final fight of the movie, was great to sit through and see it develop, awesome build up and great payoff, including some possible foreshadowing for The Avengers, maybe???

Sure there are a few issues with the film but I'd have to go into spoilers to explain them and I don't feel like ruining the movie for others who maybe reading this who haven't seen it yet. So go see Captain America: The First Avenger and then start the countdown to May 4, 2012 when this series of Marvel films finally will payoff and The Avengers will kick off what will hopefully the best movie summer in a long time.",1311292800,5,4097,4.535859269282815
4694353,5,B005GYJPYW,"During World War II, Steve Rogers is eager to enlist to serve his country and defend it against invaders. But Steve is a scrawny 95 pound young man with asthma and a weak heart. But a doctor sees Steve's eagerness and determination and decides to give him a chance in a special experimental division of the army. There, Steve proves himself worthy and brave enough to be the first test subject for a super-soldier serum. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientific faction called Hydra has found a remarkable substance that just may change the course of the war.

With extraordinary special effects and CGI, Chris Evans begins the film as a small, weak man. His transformation to Captain America is worth the price of admission alone. Evans completely embodies both Steve Rogers - the brave but bullied weakling to the strong super-soldier. Tommy Lee Jones plays Captain America's commanding officer to scene-stealing perfection. And supporting roles by Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter), Sebastian Stan (`Bucky' Barnes), Dominic Cooper (Howard Stark), and Stanley Tucci (Dr. Erskine) added humor and heart to the film. Hugo Weaving was chilling and brilliance as Johann Schmidt, the evil mastermind behind Hydra.

The story takes place almost completely in 1942, with beautiful settings and Stark-infused technology and fun gadgets. With plenty of action, adventure, suspense, and laughs - fans of all ages will enjoy this fantastic re-imaging of an iconic super hero. It would have been easy to make this a simple action/adventure film, but the writers did an amazing job of infusing drama, patriotism, and light-hearted humor to balance the story. This comic book fan had high hopes and was not disappointed. Intrigue, excitement, and romance - the film is riveting from beginning to end.",1311292800,5,1771,5.167247386759582
4694354,5,B005GYJPYW,"Marvel seems to be resembling Pixar as of late, considering how they've made so many high quality movies, and success after success at the box office, with a seemingly unbroken string of great superhero films, from Iron Man, to the Incredible Hulk, and Thor.  One would think after a while, their luck would run out, and a sub-par film would be break the chain of hits.  Thankfully, with the release of, ""Captain America:  The First Avenger,"" that string remains unbroken.

""Captain America:  The First Avenger,"" tells the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny weakling desperate to get into World War Two, despite his tiny form and long list of health problems.  Feeling left out when his friends and his country head off to war, he's offered the chance to join a program that may help him become a powerful super soldier, and help change the course of the war.  Jumping at the task, he quickly finds himself confronting what may be the Nazi's most powerful figure, and weapons that could end the war, and not in favor of the allies.

What makes ""Captain America"" so great is that it knows exactly what it sets out to be:  A homage to the serials of the 30's and 40's, in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark (there's even a clever nod to it early on).  Combining elements of war films, science fiction, and pulp fiction, ""Captain America"" is a near perfect blend of all three, with great action scenes, an awesome retro feel, and a nice sense of humor.  There's nary a weak note to be found here, as the cast is strong all throughout, with Chris Evans portraying a hero who has no ego, and only wants to do the right thing, and Hugo Weaving proving once more that he can play bad guys like no one else, embodying the scientific madness of the Red Skull.  To top it off, the visuals and production values are top notch throughout, and the film really does feel like a comic book come to life, with each new action sequence outdoing the last.

If I had to nitpick, the only real flaw in the film is a a romance subplot between Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter that I felt was unnecessary.  But even then, the film seems to realize the same thing, as it doesn't go very far, a fact that I'm glad for.  ""Captain America"" focuses on constantly providing thrills and adventure, and succeeds wonderfully.  While it does feel a bit long, I didn't mind in the slightest.  If anything, I wanted to see even more of Captain America's world, as this is a film filled with optimism, where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's no grim and grittiness that so often drenches today's heroes.

I could keep raving about the action, the costumes, the humor, but I'll leave it at this:  ""Captain America"" is now one of my favorite superhero films.  It knows what it wants to do, doesn't deviate from the path, brings all of it's elements together, and provides a light hearted escapism that the world so desperately needs.

Viewed in tandem with other Cap movies, this movie is exactly what it needs to be.  This represents the worldview of the 1940's, the context that Cap is coming from in subsequent Avengers and Cap movies.  It's what they contrast against, and they are better for it.  That's not enough to make me say this movie is good per se.  As I said above, it's what it needs to be for the saga.",1527033600,,482,4.184782608695652

4694400,5,B005GYJPYW,"I've been catching up on all my Marvel Universe movies. I finally sat down and watch all the Iron Man's because once you watch one you're hooked and have to see them all. I remember when Captain America first released and there were mixed reviews. People said things like it's skippable, wasn't really thrilling, etc. Now I'm wondering what movie did they watch because this was good. I wonder if the mixed feelings were over the time period, since they tried to somewhat stay true to Captain America's storyline. I notice more and more that some movies that were released and based on a specific past time always get reviewed harshly. Not sure why but this was great and had a superb ending. A bit of advice, if you're going through the Marvel Movies, you can watch Iron Man on its own but try to watch the others in order. It helps and you'll notice along the way each one's ending essentially ties into the next's beginning.",1525392000,3,927,4.5568862275449105

While the superhero stuff was fun, the ""science"" was nothing more than attempting to set the stage for the Avengers.",1521590400,,417,4.225
4694439,5,B005GYJPYW,"After seeing Avengers, I wasn't very enthusiastic about seeing a movie dedicated to Captain America.  He didn't do much in Avengers and seemed a rather boring character.  I was WRONG.  This movie surprised me in all the right ways.  It tells the story of a pipsqueak with a brave heart.  He sees all his friends enlisting to fight in WWII against the Nazis and can't bear not doing his part.  His health problems, numberable, and his frail physical stature prevent him from passing his medical exams.  One day, a doctor decides to give him a chance in a special experimental program, which he gladly accepts.  He walks into a machine and is transformed into a perfect human specimen!  (I do wish there was more of an explanation of how that happened, however).  Stark's dad (younger version) makes a few cameo appearances in this and the next Capt. America movie.  Captain America puts together a special fighting team including his friend Bucky and some B-list characters from the Marvel Universe and set out to stop Nazi Germany's Red Skull from using the tesseract to power Dr. Zola's insanely powerful weapons.  This movie has a great lesson for everyone:  no matter how many times you get picked on, kicked around or otherwise traumatized, you need to keep a good heart.  It's what's inside that makes the man, not the body or the outward strength.  Captain America: The First Avenger did a great job with that message.

The special effect are good and compliant the action of the film like Cap throwing his shield or hand to hand combat.

4694446,4,B005GYJPYW,"My daughter is in 1st grade and has been getting into superhero movies.  It started with Wonder Woman (a DC flick) and then somehow she saw Spiderman: Homecoming, I don't remember the details that led to that.  But if she's going to get into the MCU, she needs to watch them in order to get all the background and context.

Leading up to the Avengers, we needed to see Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  We also did Iron Man 2 as that came before the Avengers but we skipped the Hulk since it had another actor and didn't have an origin story, didn't really contribute like the others did.

Taking place in WWII, which she doesn't really know about, I didn't know how well she'd take to it compared to the others set in modern times.  But this movie is a key prerequisite for the Avengers movie; we had to see it.  I prepped her by talking about the Wonder Woman movie being WWI and this was WWII (when you look at it, there actually are a number of plot parallels between these two movies) and she got through it okay.

I don't think she liked it as much as Iron Man and Thor but she liked it enough to rewatch it a few times, as she does many movies.

From a ""family friendly"" perspective, it's a little annoying that all these movies (not just MCU) feel the need to slip in one or two profanities just to cement a PG-13 rating.  I mean, I'm not profanity-adverse but I'm not in a hurry to expose a 6 year old to that language yet (not to mention her 3 year old sister watches them with her).  So far, though, they don't seem to have made an impression - I did tell her ""if you hear any grownup language, just ignore it"", for whatever that was worth...

Setting the ""final"" stage prior to 2012's ""The Avengers"", Captain America comes to life in a new live action movie, 2011, (there was one prior in 1990 with a different cast). With a great cast and a script that does it ""justice"", Chris Evans dons the suit for Captain America.
After his stint as the ""Torch"" in Fox's ""Fantastic Four"" 2 movie debacle, he decided on a better role!
It's a great cast and with Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter, wow! What a beauty!
Hydra and The Red Skull are Captain America's nemesis and this is the first time we get to see the ""TESERACT"" {May not be spelled correctly), which would have a greater role in the 2012's ""The Avengers"" with Loki, brother of THOR, using it as a weapon of destruction on Earth, once again.

I own the original 3D Bluray set with DVD and Digital from 2011, but beware on here. The Digital copy is expired, unless it is the newer re-released 2017 cover edition with Captain America only on the cover.

The 3D is spectacular! Also be cautious when ordering that on here. Check Region before ordering to make sure you can play it here in North America. region A.

4694523,4,B005GYJPYW,This movie is a blast,1499212800,,21,3.4
4694524,5,B005GYJPYW,"It's a good thing I don't mind eating crow, because I ate a cornfield of them AND had my foot surgically removed from my mouth after I first saw this film.  It's hard for me to believe that I first watched this film under duress.  I first saw Cap in the comics during the first Civil War.  Even though I'd never been an action comic fan before, he won me over completely.

However, when I heard they'd cast Chris Evans, I was outraged.  At that time in comics, the push was to turn all the good guys into smart-aleck-y jerks, and while I'd liked Evans in the Fantastic Four (his performance was really the only thing worth watching in either movie, tbh), he wasn't built like Cap and I was convinced Marvel was going to remake Cap into a swaggering Johnny Storm clone.  (Mind you, it worked great for Johnny Storm, but Johnny Storm is NOT Cap.)

Now, years later, I can't think of anyone else who could ever fill Evans' shoes as Steve Rogers or as Captain America.  He's THAT kind of iconic.  Marvel's done incredibly well with its casting overall, particularly with RDJ as Tony Stark, but to me, Evans went one better, simply because Steve is SUCH a difficult character to get just right.  Evans captures that blend of earnestness, dedication and heart perfectly and never goes over the edge of being a goody-two-shoes or holier than thou.  He's Captain America, but what always shines through is that little guy from Brooklyn who never ran from a fight.

I was further gobsmacked when I got a chance to watch the extended version of the movie and saw some of the behind the scenes.  It never occurred to me just HOW much I had bought into the transformation without questioning it until I saw the actual footage of  full-size Evans doing all the skinny Steve action -- floundering on push-ups, staggering in the alley, the body language and his so-palpable frustration and guilt at not being able to go.  Yes, the CGI is beyond noteworthy, but it was the acting beneath that sold it.  All the CGI in the world wouldn't have sold skinny Steve if the acting hadn't matched it.

As if that weren't enough, Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter is absolutely luminous.  In anyone else's hands, I think Peggy Carter would have been a typical love interest.  Not with Atwell.  Carter is one of the best depictions of a strong female I can think of in any action movie.  She's not strong simply because she can punch people and she's a great shot.  She's got courage to match Steve's, belief that won't break, and she never surrenders an inch of her femininity in doing so.  I loved the One-Shot they did with her and was so glad they spun it off into her own series (and I'm still sorry they didn't go for season 3!)  I was equally glad to see Dominic Cooper return there as Howard Stark - I love me some Howard.

There simply wasn't a character I didn't like in this, from Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, to Toby Jones' perfect depiction of Doctor Zola, to Tommy Lee Jones' crusty Colonel Phillips, to Stanley Tucci's paternal Dr. Erskine.  Even Senator Brandt's glad-handing and unscrupulousness in creating Captain America in the first place worked.  If there was any weakness at all, it was *possibly* Hugo Weaving's Red Skull -- but admittedly, even in the comics, the Skull is usually a pretty over-the-top villain.  One thing Weaving *did* capture well was the Skull's megalomania and jealousy that he, the genius, had been forced to take the guise of a monster while a nobody American from Brooklyn became the ubermensch ideal of Aryan perfection instead.

I know some people have complained because parts of it toward the end seem cheesy, but to me, it's a beautiful homage by Johnston to the war films of the 40s.  I love the faint sepia tone, too, especially in contrast with the sharply colored and focused end.

And, I'll admit it:  I cried twice during this movie, and I never, ever cry.  Even as many times as I've now seen it, I still sniffle.

If I have any criticisms, it's that I wish they'd kept the deleted ending instead of the one they chose (Steve has some more to say and it's a masterwork of Nick Fury manipulating Steve in just a sentence or two) and I wish they'd made it clear that Steve had no option other than to do what he did.  I've seen the novelization of this, and without giving away spoilers, the novelization both makes it clear that Schmidt jimmies the autopilot so the plane can *only* be diverted off course by someone of Steve's strength, and it has Steve explain this to Peggy as well.  If you watch closely, you can see Schmidt breaking off a certain switch, but it's easy to miss.  It's a bit annoying because I've seen countless people complain that Steve didn't look for options -- but in fact, there were no options other than the one he had, and people are too quick to forget that sacrifice is not only a part of war...it's pretty much what you'd expect out of a super soldier.

I would recommend getting the Blu-Ray or at least the extended version so you can see just how utterly amazing the transformation really is.  I'm still sick this didn't get nominated for something.  After all, when it's *so* good we don't question it -- that's when it's truly noteworthy.

Buy it, watch it, love it.  You won't regret it.",1499212800,28,5262,4.536585365853658

4694742,4,B005GYJPYW,"A few years ago, Marvel launched an ambitious plan to set up their team superhero movie, ""The Avengers."" To do that, Marvel needed to set up all the heroes that make up the team, and Captain America is the last to get his turn. However, ""Captain America: First Avenger"" needed to be a good movie on its own, to bring the audience on-board. Did they succeed? Yes. And no.

All great superheroes have an emotional core that makes them resonate with their fans. For Iron Man, it's the story of a wealthy and selfish war profiteer whose life-threatening injury forces him to seek redemption. For Batman, it's a young boy whose parents' murder leads him to dedicate himself to fighting crime. For Captain America, it's a weakling who's transformed into the perfect man. What nerd wouldn't love to be turned into a muscle-bound superhero? That's where the movie succeeds.

In the beginning of the film, we see Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) as a ninety-pound weakling going from recruitment center to recruitment center to enter the Army, but his laundry list of illnesses make him an instant 4-F. When a German scientist working on the Super-Soldier process notices him, he decides Rogers is the perfect candidate. I thought the best special effect in the entire movie was the pre-Cap Steve Rogers, where they grafted Chris Evans' head onto a skinny little body. It made his transformation into Captain America all the more gratifying.

Almost immediately after he gets his new body, Rogers is turned into a folk hero dubbed Captain America. Unfortunately, Rogers isn't a soldier yet - he gets put on the USO circuit. It's a clever twist that continues Rogers' frustration at not being allowed to become a soldier, while also giving him an excuse to get his costume. Eventually, Cap gets the chance to become the soldier he was meant to be, and battle the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), a brutal scientist who arms his evil Nazi splinter group HYDRA with laser weapons. We're denied the thrill of seeing Cap punch out guys in Nazi uniforms, but seeing him bounce his shield off guys in HYDRA uniforms is still pretty good.

The biggest problem with ""First Avenger"" is that it's more interested in setting up the Avengers movie and potential sequels for Captain America than telling a self-contained story. Instead of seeing a coherent storyline of Captain America's war against HYDRA, we get a brief montage of Cap charging into random battles, then a climactic battle between him and the Red Skull with nothing in between. Instead of an ending that resolves the story, the movie cuts off with ""To Be Continued in 'Avengers'"" all but flashing on the screen. It's a shame, because ""First Avenger"" is a lot of fun, but they hamstrung themselves with the need to set up other movies.",1474416000,,2766,4.816842105263158

I have a great deal of technical know how and none of the hoops the support rep had me jump through should have made any difference.

4694794,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger
 Captain America: The First Avenger proves that it is possible to take an antique comic book hero and transform him into a vibrant, entertaining twentieth century movie star.  After the disappointing Thor and Green Lantern comic based films, we are able to delight in the honest heroics of this latest comic to movie project.
 For once the special effects really add to the movie.  Somehow the movie magic men transformed hunky beefcake Chris Evens, the star, (Push, Fantastic Four) into a small thin guy with numerous ailments, ailments so taxing that they made him ineligible for the U.S Army, even in the dark days of World War II. In the story line, Evens is transformed into Captain America by the efforts of a refugee scientist from Germany, played by Stanley Tucci (most recently seen in Easy A and Burlesque.)  Tucci brings his typical kindness and wisdom to the role of a scientist who deeply cares for his human lab rats.  He chooses the weakling to become a super soldier because of the boys character strengths not his physical strengths.  We agree that when building a super soldier, one should choose a candidate who will not casually misuse his power.
 Everything about Captain America comes right from the top shelf of movie making.  I enjoyed it as much as Iron Man of a few years past, and for many of the same reasons.  The hero is accessible to us.  He has extraordinary courage in a frail frame.
 Director Joe Johnston made such crowd pleasers as Jurassic Park III and Jumanji.  He creates a more or less realistic world where the events seem to actually be possible. He teams with writing duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley.  The writers bear the responsibility and the kudos for the string of successful Narnia films.  The writing is lucid and flowing with enough jokes to make us smile from time to time.  No great film can be possible without great writing.
 We continue a trend with Captain America of good films that are filled with familiar and fine actors.  Tommy Lee Jones, perhaps too old to play a fighting Army Coronel, leads the second and third tiers of actors.  Hugo Weaving is casually monstrous as Red Skull (I won't go into the plot but Red Skull is not on our side in WWII.)  Hayley Atwell is the leading lady.  I bonded with her right at the beginning when she punches out an aggressive American G.I.  Neal McDonough (of scores of roles including Band of Brothers) plays against type as a comically imbibing Irish soldier.  Dominic Cooper is wry and exuberant as Howard Stark, father of Tony Stark featured in the Iron Man films.  Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel comics has as usual a cameo.  Samuel L. Jackson comes on at the end of the film to set up the widely anticipated Avengers film.  The Avengers include Thor, Captain America and Iron Man.
 This refreshingly good movie rates a very high four saw blades.  It has been given a mild PG-13 classification.  It runs two hours and five minutes.  Be sure and wait until the credits are over before exiting, there is a relevant trailer at the very end.  Even with a huge $140 budget, Captain America should be one of the bigger and more profitable movies of the summer.",1469923200,2,3210,4.668449197860962

4694797,4,B005GYJPYW,"Chris Evans IS Steve Rogers, unprecedentedly touching and engaging for a superhero. The first half is vastly superior, unfortunately the second half resorts to a simplistic story of goodies versus baddies. That being said, it still epitomizes the genre better than most of its contemporaries.

Blu-ray Review 5/5

4694869,5,B005GYJPYW,"When all the Marvel movies started coming out, I had a particular fondness with Captain America:  The First Avenger since it was done almost as a period piece with Captain America's origin story of fighting Nazi's/Hydra during World War 2.  Chris Evans proved himself to be a great leading man, taking on a crazy workout/diet/routine that transformed him into a believable character within this comic book movie.

Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is pure nerd magic... Really the entire cast and crew of this movie was really well done and it shows in their final product.  Great how they got the interaction with the Starks.  The setup for the first Avengers movie with Nick Fury talking to the Cap at the end of the movie is great and even the tie-in with the Thor movies and the tesseract cube makes this my hands down favorite superhero movie out of the Avengers franchise.

Regular blu-ray here... with some extra features (director commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple of other things).  I'm sure they will come out with a collectors set since Civil War just came out... though there could be many more Captain America movies to come.",1466380800,4,1137,4.770408163265306

4694877,5,B005GYJPYW,"I would be considered very cautious about what films my family and I see nowadays - what with all the horrible stuff coming out of Hollywood. I can say, with hardly a reservation, though, that this movie is one of the best I've seen since...well, since I don't know when. It harkens back to a day before the rise of the tainted antihero and the haze of moral ambiguity, and watching it is like a breath of clean, fresh mountain air. The story of Steve Rogers is the story of a good man who wants only the opportunity to fight for what he knows to be right - and he is willing to do so with nothing more than the heart and determination he possesses. When he is given his opportunity, along with new physical strength and stature, he does not sacrifice his strength of character or conviction, but becomes the hero that his country - and the world - needs. An amazingly well-done film, perfectly cast, and thoroughly entertaining. An instant classic.",1466035200,,949,4.491329479768786

I understand not to expect a valid code for a Blu-Ray that is almost five years old, but the product came with the exact artwork displayed, but no DVD. In fact, the case only had a slot for the Blu-Ray, meaning the artwork and Blu Ray disc were put into a different case. I've ordered from Zoverstock before and was very satified, and even now, I hold no regrets from my Amazon purchases, but I bought the Blu Ray/DVD combo. If that literally was not what was in stock, why advertise it as such? I like the product and wouldn't want to return it, but even if I wanted to I couldn't.

In complexities, I am not talking about ""Citizen Kane"" level drama. But, the movie adequately points out and creates tension in the character himself.

The action was incredible. Fight scenes.. war scenes.. Even the Red Skull didn't come off as cheesy comic book tripe.

I loved it and recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy a well written action flick. That it is a comic book hero is truly irrelevant. Movie stands on its' own. And the sequel is even better..",1463788800,2,587,4.689320388349515

My only problem is that Red Skull didn't make as big as an impression as I wanted. Red Skull is supposed to one of the most dangerous and terrifying Marvel villains. It's Hugo Weaving, you'd think they'd be able to work with that and give us a truly threatening and unforgettable Johann Shmidt. But I think that's true with all the MCU movies. With the exception of Loki, all their villains are just 'okay'. They're not horrible, but they're not remarkable either. They don't have any backstory or personality, so you can't connect with or understand them, and they're not so threatening that their malice is enough to carry them through. However, the overwhelmingly good portrayal of every hero, and the fabulous plot, effects, script, and choreography is enough to carry all the films to success.",1462838400,,970,4.779761904761905

4695108,5,B005GYJPYW,"Loved this movie. I liked, unlike in the original Captain America film, 95% of this film takes place during WWII. The movie was funny, smart, thoughtful, and action packed. Unlike the DC Cinematic Universe, the MCU is well thought out. I would actually start with this movie in any marathon. It takes place first chronologically, and Captain America is kind of the face of the Avengers.",1461024000,,386,4.863636363636363
4695109,5,B005GYJPYW,"I saw ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and the Avengers movies, but didn't get around to seeing ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" until yesterday on Amazon.com. It's a great movie with plenty of action that did an impressive job bringing to life one of the comic books I'd read as a kid. One thing you should know, however, is that it felt like the film assumes some familiarity with Captain America going in. Considering Captain America's popularity, this probably isn't too big an assumption to make. (Mild spoilers ahead) To me, the most striking example of this is that the movie doesn't mention what the Super Soldier Serum is until just before Steve Rogers is injected with it in the story. This was probably just a creative choice, but it felt like the narrative concerning how Steve Rogers would become a super soldier happened a bit late in the story. This is a really minor point, however. Even without that knowledge, I think you'll be able to follow and enjoy this very entertaining movie. Highly recommended.",1461024000,,1029,4.8522727272727275

4695144,1,B005GYJPYW,"I've watched most of the Marvel series, even though I was not a comic book reader growing up.  And I've enjoyed them.  They contained a good selection of character interplay, back story, action, all coupled with production quality.  On any of those axis, this movie is a complete dud.  In fact, it is one of only a handful of movies in my entire life that I didn't even bother to finish.  Waste of time.  Flat characters, the story is basically ""skinny boy makes good"", the villain is completely contrived, and the action that is supposed to be occurring in WWII time frames has been so modernized in techno style and feel that it just blows suspension of disbelief right out of the water.

I made the mistake of paying for this movie in a burst of enthusiasm for 'content in the cloud'.  Waste of money to the point that I'm going to delete it (to absolutely ensure no recommendations).",1459123200,,887,4.534591194968553

This studio is doing the right thing that allows me to watch the movie and not have to juggle 600 apps on where i need to watch the movie.  If i own the movie i should also receive a digital copy on any provider.  If i shell out 15-20 for a movie when everyone else is stealing them digitally i should be rewarded for it.

4695231,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the greatest superhero origins film I have seen. The First Avenger works as a period piece primarily set during World War II that blends a little Indiana Jones into it, the latter of which is not entirely a coincidence, since director Joe Johnston was an effects artist and art director on Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is a load of fun.

Chris Evans is wonderful as Steve Rogers, the character that becomes Captain America through the Super Soldier Serum. Compared to his role as a playful Johnny Storm in the two Fantastic Four films a decade ago, he plays an earnest character convincingly. Hugo Weaving portrays Johann Schmidt, a Nazi officer who is the commander of Hydra, a Nazi terrorist organization. Weaving plays the role menacingly. Another standout includes Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, a fierce officer with the Strategic Science Reserve who eventually develops a relationship with Steve. Stanley Tucci is unrecognizable as his role as Dr. Abraham Erskine, the German scientist responsible for the serum.

The effects are very good, for the most part. I really like the way they made Red Skull. On the other hand, I thought they could have portrayed pre-serum Rogers a little more realistically. Not only did I think the head-to-body ratio seem out of proportion, but Chris Evans did not alter his speaking voice in any way that would make you think he was at all physically weak. Instead, his voice sounded very stern, even though his digitally altered body not quite reflecting that. The film seems to be shot as if it were to emphasize that it takes place in the 40s, which I found a little off-putting. The technology incorporated in the story itself might make someone who lived through the period shake their head, but it seems to pull a lot from the science fiction imagined back in that era. The film score by Alan Silvestri fits with Captain America's patriotic themes.

I received this film as a gift as a Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy format. The casing is just like any other Blu-ray casing. Inside are two discs, one DVD and one Blu-ray. To obtain the Digital Copy, I had to use the DVD and insert it into my disc drive on my laptop. There are two options to download the movie, but really only one works. On a PC, you have an option to download it through iTunes or through Windows Media Player, but the latter option is no longer supported by Paramount. However, that's not all bad. If you download it to iTunes, not only can you play it on iTunes, but if it's linked to a Disney Movies Anywhere account, you can play it on any other platform your Disney Movies Anywhere account is linked to, which can include Amazon Video.

The casing says the movie is a Digital Copy, not Digital HD. When I played it on Amazon Video, there seemed to be a SD and an auto option. When the auto option was selected, it showed that the film was playing on HD. However, when I switched between auto and SD, I could not tell the difference, but the same was true for my other videos on Amazon Video, so it may be that my laptop does not stream video quickly enough to run the film on HD, perhaps. It looks fine, nevertheless, although probably not as good quality as Blu-ray, which is why I opted for both.

Anyway, I love this movie. I'd highly recommend it if you like superhero films, particularly those of a more positive beat, or period pieces set during World War II.",1454457600,,3428,4.576547231270358

You are supposed to insert the disk into your DVD drive while entering the code in iTunes. You have to do both, but I couldn't get it to work on three different PCs.  I am a computer geek, so I understand these kinds of issues.  I think the 2011 website is not running correctly, or an update to iTunes has changed how things function, because I could never get the Digital Copy protection system to work. I sent emails to Paramount but was just told ""It should work, it must be your fault""  Frustrating experience, so I sent it back.

4695295,5,B005GYJPYW,"Film Review Captain America: the First Avenger
 Captain America is and always will be my favorite super hero.  I thought the main actors and actresses were picked perfectly for each role.  Chris Evans fits the role of the all-American boy, Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America.  Steve Rogers is chosen to be tested in an experiment to be the next, and only, super soldier.  The serum he is injected with elevates all of the qualities of a person.  Hayley Atwell was so successful as Agent Carter, the character, still played by Atwell, became a TV show.  Hugo Weaving is a well known actor, possibly most well known for being the main antagonist in the Matrix movies.  He has played a wide variety of character types, but with his defined piercing eyes and grim smile, he is more than qualified to play a villain.
 Steve Rogers is chosen to be tested in an experiment to be the next, and only, super soldier for the Allies in WWII.  The serum he is injected with elevates all of the qualities of a person.  The master mind behind the serum is Dr. Erskine, a scientist who used to work for the Nazis but escaped after Red Skull (Weaving) tries to force him to inject him with the serum.  This leads to the main reason Rogers was picked to become a super solider.  Dr. Erskine reveals to Rogers that the serum magnifies the qualities of a person, meaning, the brave, patriotic and selfless Rogers becomes even more brave, patriotic and selfless.  This also means Red Skull, who is the leader of Hydra, a top unit of Hitlers, becomes even more evil and corrupt than before.
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time, but the part that sticks out to me the most has nothing to do with the action of the movie.  In my opinion, the special effects done on Steve Rogers before he is transformed into Captain America.  Before the transformation, Steve Rogers is pushing 55 and weighs about 100 pounds soaking wet.  Chris Evans is neither of those things.  Evans is roughly 6 190 pounds; he is a physical specimen.  CGI and a double are used for the first 30 minutes of the film to make Evans look pathetic for attempting to make it in the military.  The shorter version of Rogers doesnt quite look natural to me, but I believe thats because I know what Evans looks like in real life.  If this was done to an average person, or someone Im not familiar with, I am certain I wouldnt have noticed.
 Perhaps a more impressive use of special effects was the shot of Brooklyn from the Brooklyn Bridge and the chase scene between the newly minted Captain America and the Hydra spy.  What makes this impressive is that the shot isn't shot from Brooklyn, but actually Manchester and Liverpool England.  Two groups, Double Negative and The Senate, were used to create digital environments throughout the movie.  The group The Senate was responsible for turning the English background into the Brooklyn Bridge with the city in the background.  This shot also serves as an establishing shot, transitioning from the puny Steve Rogers at boot camp.",1449446400,,3037,4.60707635009311

4695334,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger possesses every quality a great film should have, including a central message or theme. The message is to be true to yourself and fight for what is right. This movie is cohesive and unforgettable because the theme is present throughout the entire film, and it is different from other superhero movies in that Captain Americas powers and the way he adapts to the powers are very unique.

  The theme of the film is overarching.  We continue to see Captain America fighting for what is right.  This may not always mean obeying what he is told to do, but doing what he is convinced is the right thing to do. We also continuously see Captain America staying true to himself.  When others tell him to do something that he doesnt agree with, or that goes against what he stands for, he will not do it.  He continues to do the right thing, no matter the circumstances.

  Dr. Erskine believes that Steve Rogers, otherwise referred to as Captain America, is a genuinely good man. Steve is a meager ninety-pound weakling with a remarkably strong desire to be in the army. He never gives up hope, even after being turned down time after time. Finally, he goes to a recruitment center where Dr. Erskine gives him a shot.  The doctor sees a quality in Rogers that he had been looking for in all the recruits; the ability to fight for what is right and  an innate goodness.  He believes that only a weak man knows the true value of strength, he takes a chance on Steve in hopes it will make him a better man. This is shown in the scene where Steve and Dr. Erskine are talking and Steve asks about why he was the one soldier chosen for the super soldier experiment that was to take place the very next day. Dr. Erskine tells Steve about how the serum used amplifies everything in the individual, so the good becomes better, and the bad becomes worse. He shares that he gave the super soldier serum to Johan Schmidt (aka. Red Skull) and it amplified everything bad in him and that he believes the exact opposite will happen with Rogers.  Dr. Erskine says, Whatever happens tomorrow you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are, not a perfect soldier, but a good man.

 The message to fight for what is right is conveyed in a scene that takes place before the super soldier experiment even happens.  While Steve is in training camp, all the men are in their lines doing jumping jacks and pushups when Dr. Erskine tells Colonel Phillips that he is going to pick Rodgers for the experiment. Colonel Phillips is downright stumped as to why the doctor would choose little Steve.  Colonel says, When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought What the hell, maybe he'd be useful to you like a gerbil. Never thought you'd pick him.  Phillips then goes on to try and change Dr. Erskines mind by doing a little experiment to show which of the men have the most guts.  He throws an inactive grenade at the lines of men and the only man that shows any inkling of guts is Steve. He curls up around the grenade and yells at everyone to get back.  This put a sock in Colonel Phillips mouth. Steve does what he believes to be the right thing to do, even if it means sacrificing his own life to do so.

 In one of the final scenes of the movie, Captain America shows us yet again that he will do the right thing for the country even if it means a bad outcome for him. After Cap defeats Red Skull, he is left alone on a plane that is unable to make a safe landing. He radios in to Agent Carter, Captain America: There's not going to be a safe landing, but I can try and force it down.
Agent Carter: I'll get Howard on the line. He'll know what to do.
Captain America: There's not enough time. This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York. I got to put her in the water.
Agent Carter: Please don't do this. We have time. We can work it out.
Captain America: Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are going to die. Peggy, this is my choice. Cap chooses to risk his own life because that is the right thing to do in his mind. He puts others lives before his own because that is the way his brain works. He always does what is best for the whole, not the individual.

 Captain America is different from many of the more recently made superhero movies. For one, Captain America is not superhuman.  He possesses no powers that go above those of which a human could achieve. His strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are simply enhanced to the peak of human potential. This means that if someone really tried and worked for it, they could achieve the same level of power.

  The film is also unlike many other superhero films because it does not focus on the period of adjustment between when the hero gets his or her powers and when he or she fully masters them.  In many other superhero films, half the movie is spent on an adjustment period or trial and error with their new powers, but that is not the case with Captain America. Steve Rodgers gets his powers in one scene, and in the very next scene he is putting the powers to good use. Almost as if hed always been made to have those abilities.

  There are also many visuals in the movie that stand out and help clarify some major points about Captain Americas character. For one, the costume to uniform change, at first the uniform that Steve is given is a costume that isn't practical for any type of fighting whatsoever.  Then, later on in the film, when Steve hears about a buddy of his that might be in danger, he gets a more practical uniform.  This change in uniform also illustrates the change in him; he goes from war propaganda to an actual soldier.  Another visual would be Captain Americas shield.  Instead of giving him a sword or a hammer that can do real damage, he is given a shield.  This shows that Captain America embraces defense more than offense, peace over war.  Another strong visual is Captain Americas uniform being red, white, and blue.  This shows how Rodgers stands for America and how he will always do whatever it takes to guard and protect our country.

  Captain America could easily be one of the top superhero movies of our time. This movie stands out because of all the differences between it and other superhero movies. The differences make people more intrigued, and interested in the plot of the movie. The film also covers all the bases when it comes to successfully conveying a message or theme to its audience. The message may be interpreted in different ways, but the overarching theme, is to stand up for what you believe in and always fight for what is right.",1446508800,,6699,4.425427872860635

Marvel is a comic publisher that has enthusiastic fans and respect for their creations. The comic book logo beginning that flashes across the screen of every Marvel masterpiece initiates a sensation of excitement and suspense among the audience due to their reputation of stellar superhero films. Captain America: The First Avenger was directed by Joe Johnston. A man known for his interest and expertise in special effects and fantasy department, making him the ideal candidate for this superhero film. Throughout the film, Captain America: The First Avenger, Joe Johnston was the captain of incorporating symbols of color within characters and settings.
Captain America: The First Avenger begins with a very mysterious and cold glacier setting with very dark lighting and unrevealed characters. The music by Alan Silvestri is very intense, suspenseful, and mystifying. The setting is quickly represented in 1942, the time of World War Two, when Captain America is introduced during the enlisting process. An enlistee announces, Boy a lot of guys getting killed over there. Kinda makes you think twice about enlisting, huh? Steve Rogers, later identified as Captain America, replies with a firm Nope. Steve Rogers is portrayed as a scrawny, driven, and desperate man who wants nothing more than to serve his country. Doctor Abraham Erskine is introduced into the movie by being intrigued by Steve Rogers intensified eager to join the army. Also, at this time in the movie, Stark industries is thrown into the mix when Tony Starks father, Howard Stark, speaks about a flying car and his new technology he is inventing. This uniquely foreshadows that Doctor Abraham Erskine, Steve Rogers, and Howard Stark will eventually be together again in another situation of experimentation when Steve Rogers is transformed into Captain America. When Captain America is transformed in the lab, he brings to life the American red, white and blue uniform that becomes his icon. His iconic outfit purposely stands out from the other soldiers because he has become their respected leader, their captain. As the scenes shuffle, we eventually come face-to-face with the lair of Nazi officer Johann Schmidt. His cold, dark, uninviting, yet modern room incorporates mainly dark colors with seamless highlights of fluorescent blue. The hints of fluorescent blue generate the connection to the Tesseract and how it has the power connect to the out of the world forces that exist. This is tied with Schmidt because he desperate searches for greater power and does this through rage. Joe Johnston used this technique to hint to the audience about Schmidt use of the Tesseract as an alternative power source and how the Tesseract drives Schmidts evil mentality. Schmidt reveals his true face for the first time when Captain America invades the Hydra site. He throws his fake human skin face into the fire below to show that the war between Captain America and him has begun and he is officially ready to fight. Schmidts true boiling red face explains the constant rage that is exemplified through his want for greater power. The music at the end of the film proves to be accurate to the audiences and the characters emotions during the scene. Alan Silvestri incorporated slow, intense, and heroic music while Captain America drove the plane into the water. This exemplified the intensity of the sacrifice he made. Then, it almost immediately switched to cheers to reassure the audience that the Captain did the heroic job of ending the war and truly saving all Americans.

Joe Johnston uses symbols throughout the film in a simple way. He does this by zooming in and drawing attention for the sole purpose of forcing the audience to notice and remember the symbol for a reason. The first symbol is shown to the audience during Joe Johnstons technique of a flash-forward scene as the first scene of the movie. The audience is presented with Captain Americas red, white, and blue shield cemented underneath the ice. This initiates the audiences thoughts that this movie revolves around American values and gives the suspenseful feeling of what couldve occurred that lead to the heros symbol being inaccessible. The following symbol that the camera zooms up on is the octopus as the emblem on the front of the car that shows the obvious enemy side: Hydra. The last main symbol of importance that immediately comes to the audiences attention is the Tesseract; the fluorescent, blue, and glowing cube that connects to extraterrestrial life. It is clearly depicted as a instance of importance because it was introduced with high interest from the villain character, Johann Schmidt, and was secretly hidden in the dark and dusty tomb.

One main genre that was incorporated throughout the entire film was romance. The primary aspect of romance was between Steve Rogers and Agent Carter. Agent Carter was introduced as division supervisor and was consistently intrigued and impressed by Steve Rogers heroic qualities. Agent Carter never failed to have a glimpse of red on her at all times portraying her aspects of intimacy and female sexuality. Along with Agent Carters constant quality of red, she also has the typical outfit of red, white, and blue which tied her and Captain America together throughout the whole movie. Another genre that was illustrated was science fiction. The clips involving the Tesseract incorporate large amounts of science fiction because of its computer-generated qualities and capabilities. A majority of the weapons and soldiers that were under control of Johann Schmidt portray science fiction because they are futuristic and utilize the Tesseract as a power source. The genre of action is constantly displayed during battles between Captain America and the army against Hydra. This constant fight continues until it is finalized with a fight between Captain America and Johann Schmidt. The action on the American side is less advanced compared to Hydra due to the time period and lack of intelligence with futuristic materials versus Hydra has the brain of Schmidts extreme scientist that allowed Hydra to take their weapons quality and quantity to the next level making the fight harder to achieve for the Americans, but not impossible. The last, most important genre that was depicted in the film was the comic genre. The films comic qualities constantly make an appearance through the hero, villain, and storyline. The typical comic book plot shows through by having a hero that was introduced from the start and slowly found his duty to the world. Eventually, the hero developed an arch-nemesis to battle against until the end when the hero is forced to make a drastic sacrifice that gives him the ultimate hero reputation.

Captain America: The First Avenger was a film created as an idealistic hero movie. Joe Johnston effectively incorporated different settings, lighting, special effects, and genres in order to give this film the spark it needed to be rated as a successful superhero movie. As a viewer in the audience, I believe Johnston worked hard to integrate scenes that truly depicted Steve Rogers mental dedication to saving lives. In my opinion, the most crucial scene, was when the commanding officer of Rogers division threw a grenade at the men to test their response and while every man ran away for their safety, Rogers ran and jumped on top of the grenade to sacrifice himself. This scene sparked my interest because I feel like it became a turning point for the audience to notice that Rogers was the clear candidate to be Captain America: Americas fighting hero. This scene goes to show that there are many undiscovered individuals out there that are willing to put forth the effort that is required in order to contribute to the greater good of society.",1446508800,,7796,5.108150470219436

4695350,2,B005GYJPYW,"This film mostly didn't work for me. When I watch a superhero movie I expect action, humour, babes (OK, at least one) and of course a colourful, cool evil villain as well as some despicable evil sidekicks, disposable evil henchmen and extravagant evil weapons, vehicles or lairs. The superhero himself is finally not all that important. Here, most of those necessary elements were MIA.

1. Action. There is some, but it is totally forgettable.
2. Humour. There is some, but not nearly enough. This movie actually tries even to take itself seriously - which is a major mistake
3. Babes. Two, but one just makes a cameo. The other one is acceptable - but wears too much clothes.
4. Villain. The biggest disappointment of the film. Red Skull is amongst the coolest comic books villains EVER - here, he appears late, does little and is disposed off quickly and easily. Poor Red Skull...
5. Despicable evil sidekick. Actually, not bad. Despicable dr Arnim Zola is one of the few strong points of this film.
6. Disposable henchmen. They are indeed disposable - a little bit too much disposable...
7. Extravagant weapons, vehicles and/or lairs. Meh... Not terrific.

Ultimately, for my personal taste, it is mostly a failed film, the weakest of Marvel movies. I enjoyed ""Avengers"" (the first one), ""The winter soldier"", ""The guardians of the Galaxy"", both ""Thors"" (or should I rather say ""both Loki's"") and ""Ant Man"" much more.

4695408,5,B005GYJPYW,"This entry into the Marvel mythos takes us back to the dark days of World War II, specifically 1942, where we meet Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a ""90-pound asthmatic"" from Brooklyn who, in his boyhood, ""didn't know enough to walk away from a fight"" and consequently spent most of his life getting beaten up.  Now he desperately wants to serve his country, and a factory job isn't enough: he wants to fight.  He's tried five times to enlist, and been rejected each time.  Then he's noticed by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a refugee from Germany who, apparently unaware of the Fuhrer's plans for world domination, originated for him a serum that can make an ordinary man into a ""super soldier""--and worked, to a point, on its first subject, Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), but also transformed him into the grotesque, crimson-skinned Red Skull, the head of a secret military program called Hydra.  Impressed by Steve's devotion to his country, Erskine gets him into the program, and the serum works even better this time: suddenly Steve's cells can regenerate (thereby curing his various maladies), he can bend iron, punch through armored glass, sprint at 40 MPH, toss grown men around like beanbags, and jump 50' or more.  But a German spy has infiltrated the audience, and Erskine is killed and his machines destroyed.  ""He promised me an army,"" growls Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), ""and I got...you.""  Unwilling to risk the only super soldier the US is likely to have, he sends Steve off on a tour to drum up the purchase of war bonds.  Then Steve learns that his lifelong buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), has been captured by the Germans while trying to put a stop to Hydra.  Helped by British MI5 liaison Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and wealthy defense contractor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper)--probably Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark's great-grandfather--he sets out on a lone commando raid and manages to rescue some 400 men being used by Schmidt as slave labor.  But in the process he learns that Schmidt has somehow obtained a mysterious artifact (supposedly ""left on Earth by the gods"") which he has used to create weapons that literally disintegrate their targets in a flash of blue lightning.  What's more, he's decided that with it he can make himself--not Hitler--the master of the world.  Now it's up to Steve--""Captain America""--to find and obliterate Schmidt's hidden weapons factories, and stop him before he can take off in his giant flying wing, the Valkyrie, to destroy New York and Chicago.

As always, the special effects are great and the characters, despite their fantastic powers, retain comprehensible human emotions that make it easy to root (or hiss) for them.  It would have been nice to know something more about Schmidt's artifact--what *is* it, really?--but presumably even he wasn't quite sure how it got where he found it.  And, of course, there's plenty of fast, violent (but not graphic) action.",1441411200,,2944,4.979591836734694

4695435,4,B005GYJPYW,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed most of this movie after my nephew insisted I watch it. I'm not a fan of superhero movies and I'd never heard of Chris Evans before watching this. (I managed that by being more of a reader than movie watcher, and not being exposed to TV or celeb gossip mags.)

I fast forwarded through all the riduculous, mythological Hydra parts, once I got the picture. Ditto with the violence. Obviously, you're going to have violence in a superhero movie, but I didn't need it to enjoy this film. There was so much fun and interesting character development, particularly where the main character is concerned. I found myself liking Evans more than any actor I've seen in a long time. His portrayal is spot on, with the combination of innocence, passion and integrity that would have made a less natural and unself-conscious actor look comical...and not in a good way.

I thought all the actors were wonderful (how can you go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones in a supporting role?), and the movie magic of turning Evans into a ninety pound weakling (I actually liked him better in that part; he played it so true) blew me away. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is I didn't like the violence or suggestion of occultism. Which of course is subjective and won't affect how others see this film.

After watching this, I bought other movies with Evans in them (Cellular, Sunshine, Loss of a Teardrop Diamond) and came away wishing he'd do a remake of one of my favorite books (which has twice been made into a movie) Lost Horizon by James Hilton. The main character, although English, is in every other way described as being very like Chris Evans: ""There was something Elizabethan about him--his casual versatility, his good looks, that effervescent combination of mental with physical activities."" ""He had a peculiar charm, a sort of winsomeness that's pleasant to remember...with a core of attractiveness to him."" ""He's got a sort of way with him of dealing with people."" ""He was tall...with brown short cropped hair and slate blue eyes. He was inclined to look severe or brooding until he laughed, then...he looked boyish.""

I really feel it's time someone remade the story of Shangri La for modern times... if only to wipe out the memory of the Michael Yorke musical version. And Chris Evans seems the perfect person to make it come alive. How about it, Mr. Evans?",1440115200,,2394,4.720095693779904

4695563,3,B005GYJPYW,"It's not as good as the second Captain America movie, but this one makes the second one make so much sense so you can't skip it.  I think this movie was great in 2011, but watching in 2015 I feel that it's lacking, and I'm not sure what it is. There are a lot of good scenes in this movie, but I think that some of the movie was a bit corny which was probably due to the fact that it was set in the 1940's.
 The Avengers came out in 2012, and when I watched it in 2012 I thought that it was fantastic. I'd have to watch it again to give a more accurate verdict, but in my opinion the first Avengers is a better movie than Captain America - and the Winter Soldier is even better, and is a tie with the Avengers.
I said all of that to say that it's not a timeless film for me. I am more apt to watch the first Avengers again and Winter Soldier. I think you will find it to be a decent movie with good acting, and no miscasts. I do have to say that Chris Evans makes a good choice for Captain America and I find the language and the mannerisms in the 1940's really entertaining. It would have been odd to hear some modern-day jargon  in a movie set in the past. Chris Evans sticks with the same jargon and mannerisms of his time in the 2nd film as well which makes it obvious that he is still adjusting to being in a time he was never meant to see.

4695593,4,B005GYJPYW,"On the surface, perhaps no member of The Avengers would seem more difficult to bring to a modern audience than Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Seen as perhaps something of an artifact of a time gone by, here was a character whose jump to the big screen had long been stuck in development hell. Despite a somewhat ironic title (the irony being that this would be the last of the origin films released before The Avengers), 2011 saw Cap make the leap successfully in Captain America: The First Avenger, bringing with him an interesting new angle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

A large part of the success of the film might well be down to the choice of leading man. Chris Evans was an initially controversial choice to play the role, due in large part to his already having played another notable Marvel hero in the two Fantastic Four films some years previously. Yet like Daniel Craig's James Bond, once given the chance to see him in action the criticisms were largely silenced. Evans managed to successfully play not just the almost superhuman commando we've come to know and love but also the man Steve Rogers was before that: a puny, young guy from Brooklyn who seemed to embody the old saying about nice guys finishing last. Evans keeps that good guy aspect of the character in sight throughout the film from his interactions with his fellow characters to his reactions to events. Evans managed to take a potentially clichd superhero from another time and make him into a genuinely likable character.

For that matter, the film all around has a strong cast. Hugo Weaving makes a fine nemesis in the form of Hydra leader Johann Schmidt, bringing a suitably sinister air to the character right from his very first scene in the film to the dramatic moment about midway through when he reveals the Red Skull persona (itself a triumph of prosthetic makeup). Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes is notable as well both for his chemistry with Evans' Rogers which makes their friendship believable even when their roles are reversed but for also firmly establishing an idea of the character in the mind of the audience (something even more important in light of where the character would eventually be developed in the future). Filling in more traditional roles with memorable performances are Toby Jones as Hydra scientist Arnim Zola, Tommy Lee Jones as the initially skeptical commander of the Strategic Scientific Reserve and Stanley Tucci as ex-pat German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine who recruits Rogers.

Though the film's setting during the Second World War means that female characters are fairly few, the character from the film besides Rogers that perhaps stands out the most is Haley Atwell's Peggy Carter. While she does, as she did in the comics, become something of a love interest for Rogers, thankfully there's far more to the character than that. Atwell in interviews described the character as ""She can do everything Captain America can do, but backwards and in high heels,"" and the action sequences in which Carter appears certainly rather prove that point. As a result, it's something that makes her now having her own TV series not the least bit surprising.

The film's production values are strong, especially given its Second World War setting. Through its combination of script, production design and costuming, the film successfully blends the technology and weapons of that conflict with aspects of the previously established Marvel universe (both comic and cinematic, the latter perhaps being more as a result of Joss Whedon's uncredited work on the script). In fact some of the seemingly more outlandish designs form the film such as the rocket like craft Schmidt uses at one point or the large flying wing plane where the film's climactic confrontation takes place are in fact based on real life plans drawn up by the Germans during the war (the Triebflgeljger fighter plane and the Horten H.XVIII respectively). Director Joe Johnston, whose previous films include period set works such as the cult film The Rocketeer and October Sky, was a perfect choice to direct the film which combines period setting and characters with action sequences (indeed The Rocketeer arguably bares some similarities to the film itself). The icing on the cake might well be the score from Alan Silvestri which manages to be exciting and yet timeless at the same time. The results make the film as strong as it is.

Despite the film really being done to establish the Captain's origin story, The First Avenger is book-ended by two very important scenes in the present day. The first of which reveal the discovery of a mysterious object between Arctic ice (revealed late in the film to the Hydra flying wing) that sets up the journey the viewer is about to go on while the latter presents us with a sequence where Rogers finds himself in the present day which, as well as giving us the seemingly pre-requisite appearance by Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, also firmly establishes that other iconic aspect of the character: that he is a man out of time. With that complete, the stage was set for The Avengers and the rest, as they say, was history.

First Avenger on its own though holds up quite well. Of the phase one Marvel films it's one of the most successful in bringing its characters back-story to life while also presenting a genuinely enjoyable film in the process. The result is a strong, period based action film and one of the best Marvel films to date",1433462400,,5466,4.872043010752688

4695596,4,B005GYJPYW,"This review was originally written as a ""Comment"" on a 1 star review that saw this movie as ""Corny"".  This was first sold 1 year before Pearl Harbor. It was a challenge to Adolf Hitler. My Father a WWII B25 Bomber Pilot read it. Yes this had a 1940 feel for it due to it was 1940s. It was read by the Military and their Families. It was written in a ""CORNEY"" attitude due to that was the Attitude of Americans back then. They had a GREAT Sense of Humor. Plus Comics like this one was focused on being positive. It originally was going to be called ""Super American"" but due to their were almost 25+ ""Super"" charachter comics ... they chose to use the primary officers rank ""Captain"". My Father was 14 yrs old when he joined, and was turning 16 when he flew over Germany. Yes, there were over 1000 probably 15000+ underage men and women who joined. By age they were boys and girls, but when they passed bootcamp they were men and women. [...]This site will show one that was 11yrs old ... so the corney idea of the future Captain America was under age is actually true. If you can find any WWII generation person still alive, spend a day with them, they are corney FUN!!! Comics had to be ""Corney"" back then due to America had Morales, integrity, and Charachter ... something we lost when the ""Dark"" started to come out. Our Conscience's are ""Dimmed"" down due to what Entertainment has done to America. This movie takes us back to a time we had Morales ... and sadly most people see Morales as ""Corney"".

Some of them were green, like ""The Green Hornet"" and ""Green Lantern""; some of them were not, like ""X-Men:  First Class"" and ""Thor."" Most of them proved forgettable, and some of them were actually pretty good, like ""Captain America: The First Avenger.""

Captain America, the alter ego of Steve Rogers, first appeared in ""Captain America Comics #1,"" March, 1941, published by Timely Comics (which would eventually become Marvel Comics).  Writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby created the Captain to fight against the atrocities of Nazism and later the Japanese Empire, which the Captain did throughout World War II and beyond, battling the evils of the world wherever he found them.  As time went on, the Captain's popularity waned, only to return in the 1960's when he became a leading component of ""The Avengers,"" the crime-fighting unit of superheroes that included ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" and others.  Although I am not an aficionado of these comics, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" seems to do a credible job providing us with a back story on the character as based on the sometimes conflicting comic-book accounts.

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (co-writers of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" series) wrote the screenplay, and Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer,"" ""Jumanji,"" ""October Sky"") directed it.  They do a good job making sure we don't get too bogged down in multiple characters or multiple plot lines, yet they ensure that we become involved with the personality of Captain America as much as in his derring-do.  Using a mixture of good humor and serious action, they manage to create an adventure that young and old viewers alike can appreciate without their having to be comic-book fans in the first place.  As a non-fan I enjoyed the picture; that's worth something in my book.

Anyway, as with most initial entries in a new superhero franchise, this one starts with an origin story, and as usual I enjoyed that first part of the proceedings best of all.  We always have to find out where the superhero came from and how he became a superhero, and this origin story is better than most.  It all begins (in flashback) in the early Forties, just as America enters the Second World War.  Here, we meet a mad-scientist German colonel, Johann Schmidt (alias the Red Skull and ably played as the epitome of evil incarnate by Hugo Weaving), and his assistant, Dr. Zola (played by the underrated Toby Jones), who head up HYDRA, the Nazis' deep-science division.  Schmidt has determined to get his hands on a powerful cube long ago taken from the god Odin's treasure room.  He believes it can make him and presumably Germany invincible, although he seems really interested only in himself.  Meanwhile, one of his head scientists, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci, who took the part because he says he always wanted to do a German accent), has developed a serum that enhances one's muscles, reflexes, natural abilities, and mental inclinations to the ninth degree, and Schmidt has taken it, becoming almost superhuman in his physical prowess and almost delirious in his evilness.  The fact that it has more than slightly altered his face seems of no concern to him.  Now he wants that cube.

Enter Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), your stereotypical 98-pound weakling.  Yes, it's really Chris Evans (Johnny Storm, the Human Torch in ""Fantastic 4"") as the scrawny kid, digitally altered in a most remarkable way.  I honestly thought it was a double when I first saw the picture, but it's Evans all right.  Rogers wants to join the army and help the war effort, but he's too small and puny, and the army rejects him.  Now, re-enter Dr. Erskine, who has escaped Nazi Germany to work for the Americans and is looking for a candidate for his serum.  He happens upon Rogers and admires his eagerness to serve his country; he also admires Rogers's innate goodness and knows he needs a decent, honest man, with real compassion, to experiment on.  Remember, his serum enhances one's mental traits as well as one's muscles and reflexes.  As a result, Erskine turns Rogers from a runt to a hunk, and a sensitive, thoughtful hunk at that.

However, I have to admit I enjoyed the story of the 98-lb. weakling more than that of his bigger, more-muscular counterpart.  It was as though the serum increased Rogers's physique at the expense of his personality.  The puny Steve had more charisma than the rather dull hunky Steve.  Of course, this is a necessity of the plot development.  The origin story centers on characterization; once that's over, the ensuing conflict focuses on action.  So be it.  Fortunately, director Johnston keeps the action moving along at a healthy pace.

I also liked the cast, the ones I've already mentioned and several others I would single out for special mention.  Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter is a suitably strong heroine and romantic interest.  Sebastian Stan is effective as Steve's stalwart best friend Bucky Barnes.  Tommy Lee Jones turns in another funny-tough performance as Col. Chester Phillips, the head of America's anti-HYDRA forces; it may remind you of his work in ""Men in Black.""  Dominic Cooper plays the dapper, billionaire entrepreneur Howard Stark, the father of Iron Man Tony Stark, Howard a character clearly modeled on the dapper, billionaire entrepreneur Howard Hughes.  And Samuel L. Jackson shows up once again as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

I also liked the movie's period look, one of its primary appeals.  From cars to clothes to airplanes and architecture, the film's appearance is always a pleasure to the eye.  Speaking of cars, I also liked the Red Skull's screaming automobile, a massive, open-top monster patterned on the Mercedes SSK and 540K Special Roadsters of the Thirties, only bigger and more imposing.

Sure, the film has a few drawbacks; there always are in a comic-book adaptation.  For instance, the screenwriters had to take some liberties in adjusting the characters to fit into the current ""Avengers"" screen framework.  Nevertheless, given that Captain America has himself evolved in his various comic-book incarnations over the past seventy years, as have most of his fictional colleagues, we can probably forgive the writers for any liberties they took.  And we can overlook a lot of the exaggeration that inevitably accompanies a sci-fi/fantasy adventure.  However, it's hard to explain how Rogers not only becomes bigger  and stronger (that we accept) but with the infusion of the serum instantly learns how to use martial arts and how to fly an airplane.  That seems a leap of faith even for a comic-book yarn.

Because Paramount made the film for both 2-D and 3-D release, one can see a few of the three-dimensional effects too obviously, like Captain America throwing his shield out toward the audience, but the filmmakers keep such effects to a grateful minimum.  Overall, the movie makes a good watch; just be sure to follow it to the very end, meaning through the closing credits, for the usual ""Avengers"" tie-in scene.

Video:
Paramount's video engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec to transfer the movie to Blu-ray in its native aspect ratio, 2.35:1.  The results look pretty much as I remember them from a theater, sometimes sharp, sometimes soft.  The filmmakers shot the film on conventional 35 mm stock and digitally; then, they intentionally altered the color on the final print, dulling it and often giving it a sepia-toned look to draw one's attention to the period setting.  Expect bright colors only on occasion, usually to represent the present day.  The engineers also retain the film stock's natural grain, although it never makes itself too noticeable.

Audio:
As we have come to expect from a modern action movie, the audio is half the fun.  Here, Paramount use lossless 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio to do the soundtrack up in all its glory.  It encircles the listener in surround sound, starting with an opening snowstorm, with deep, strong, taut bass, and a punchy transient impact.  Of course, as you become caught up in the movie, you tend to forget the sound and take it for granted.  Pay attention to it once in a while and appreciate how good it is.

Extras:
Disc one of this three-disc Limited 3-D Edition contains the feature film in high definition, along with a number of bonus items.  First up, there's an audio commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson, and editor Jeffry Ford.  Next, there is a series of short featurettes in high def:  ""Marvel One Shot:  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer,"" about four minutes depicting another moment in the continuing saga of the Avengers; ""Outfitting a Hero,"" eleven minutes on costuming the Captain in various scenes; ""Howling Commandos,"" six minutes on the Captain's team, especially the character of Bucky; ""Heightened Technology,"" six minutes on all the technological machines, devices, airplanes, and such; ""The Transformation,"" nine minutes on the CGI change in Steve Rogers from scrawny Steve to brawny Steve; ""Behind the Skull,"" ten minutes on the iconic villain portrayed by Hugo Weaving; ""Captain America Origins,"" four minutes with ""Captain America"" co-creator Joe Simon; and ""The Assembly Begins,"" two minutes on getting the various superheroes together for their ""Avengers"" movie.

Then we get four deleted scenes in high def totaling about five minutes, with optional commentary, which include an alternative ending.  And after those, there are several trailers:  two theatrical trailers, a game trailer, and an animated adventure trailer.

The extras on disc one conclude with seventeen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two presents the feature film in Blu-ray 3-D.  For this, you'll need a full-HD 3-D television, compatible 3-D glasses, a Blu-ray 3-D player, a high-speed HDMI cable, and, possibly, a receiver that supports 3-D audio.

Disc three contains the feature film on DVD as well as on digital copy for transfer to Windows Media or iTunes.  (Codes may not be valid after October 25, 2012.)  The three discs come housed in a non Eco-case (thankfully) with an inner sleeve, the case further enclosed by an embossed light-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:
Unlike many of the other superhero movies that arrived in 2011, ""Captain America:  The First Avenger"" is good humored and uncomplicated.  It concentrates on a single character, a single villain, a clear path to the present, and some excellent supporting performances.  Because of its period atmosphere and successful combination of characterization and action, it tops my list of best superhero films of the year.",1433030400,,11252,5.078933043004899

4695607,1,B005GYJPYW,"Thus movie was terrible. Not only is Captain America a terrible example of American hubris and chovanism, this could have been redeemed by a solid cinematic execution. But this movie is not well done. The acting isn't too bad, but the CGI is poor, even for 2011. I mean Monsters Inc came out in 2001. Clearly the technology for better-looking models and animation existed, it just wasn't utilized. The sound editing in this film is a joke. As in I literally burst out laughing at one point because the sound used for the car as they chased the villain's flying wing plane down the runway was so utterly implausible. It's just one big vomit of <insert car noise here>. And the dialog... I didn't know whether to laugh because this film appears to have been written by a child or be saddened thinking about what the box office success of this film says about the state of American film culture and the larger culture in general. I'm not an old guy. I'm not saying ""back in my day, action movies were good and had good dialog and passed the Bechdel test"". I mean come on, that's not true. I just am an American that's been to other countries and has friends from Europe and Asia. I'm a movie-goer with an IQ above 100 and a STEM degree. And I know that better films exist. Maybe this film left such a bad taste in my mouth because I had just seen Mad Max: Fury Road a few hours earlier. That wasn't a perfect film by any means but in comparison it makes this film seem like it was made for and by idiot children and as a marketing tool to sell foam shields and Lego sets. And maybe there's a bit of truth to that. Clearly, I'm just not the target demographic being pandered to here.",1432944000,,1679,4.333333333333333

With the success of said experiment, Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, our nation's greatest soldier.

4695625,4,B005GYJPYW,"Even though I'm not a huge comic book guy, there is something about Captain America that appeals to my patriotic side.  So of all the superhero movies coming out in 2011, Captain America: The First Avenger was the one I was most anxious to see.  Somehow, it didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it was still fun.

Set during World War II, the movie opens with a frustrated Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) trying anything he can to get into the army to go fight Hitler.  He has a very defined sense of right and wrong and doesn't like to see bullies of any kind.

And that's what brings him to Dr. Erskine's (Stanley Tucci) attention.  Dr. Erskine has invented a serum that will, in theory, create super powerful soldiers, and he wants Steve to be the first person it's used on.  The injection works, and not only gives Steve muscles, but also helps him grow.  Unfortunately, an attack by a rogue group of Nazis kills Dr. Erskine.

This group of Nazis wants to make their own version of super powerful soldiers and weapons and take over the world, including defeating their own.  When Steve gets winds of the plot, he begins to track them.  But is he powerful enough to take them out?

While I usually try my best to avoid 3D movies, a 3D showing was the only one that worked for my last minute trip to see this movie.  I'm actually quite glad that was the case because this is an example of good 3D.  The scenes look real and deep, and the result was occasionally beautiful and always fun.  If you are debating, this is a movie worth paying the extra to see in 3D.

The flip side is that some of the visual effects don't look as good.  Occasionally, the effects stood out as apart from the action because of the added depth of the 3D.  Actually, it's rather ironic that one effect cheapens the look of another.  Mainly, we're talking about an explosion here or there, nothing bad enough to ruin the overall look of the film.  I do have to give a shout out to the effects on the pre-serum Steve.  The different between them is so stark I was wondering how they found an actor willing to be stretched for the size difference.  It really is that believable.

No, my real complaint with the movie is the fact that the characters were two dimensional.  All of the character development felt forced, expected, and rushed.  I wanted to get to know them better, to feel for them more, but that just didn't happen.

Part of that could be Chris Evans' performance.  During the most emotional scenes, I felt like he was just reciting his lines with little effort to actually connect to them.  The rest of the cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Sebastian Stan as the best friend, and Hayley Atwell as the love interest, were all much more solid in their rolls.

As with the character beats, the story felt pretty predictable.  Maybe it's because we've seen so many superhero movies, most of which are origin pieces, that they all begin to have the same feel to them.  I was able to predict several of the bigger moments before they happened.

Now it's beginning to sound like I didn't enjoy the film, but that's not true.  It was entertaining.  There was plenty of humor, which my friends and I all laughed at.  The action scenes were great.  I just wish it had done more.

And maybe my expectations were too high to begin with.  I was hoping that Captain America: The First Avenger would stand out from the other superhero movies, and it doesn't.  Even so, it's still very entertaining.",1432339200,,3476,4.465818759936407

4695677,4,B005GYJPYW,"One of the best portrayals of Captain America on screen. The film feels more like a comic book than any of the other MCU films. Sci-fi weapons in a WWII setting, giant tanks, cars, and planes. Chris Evans owns the role and Hugo Weaving portrays the best villain so far in the MCU, including Loki.",1430352000,,296,4.4

4695766,3,B005GYJPYW,"The final film on the road to Marvel's The Avengers...
Captain America: The First Avenger is an entertaining enough film.
I'm personally not a fan of it's excessively corny atmosphere. I know it's going for a 40's theme, but I just don't like stuff that's corny, and personally, I find the musical montage in the middle of the film simply unwatchable. You've got to give it points for creativity though. I don't think there are any other big summer blockbuster films out there with the balls to have the whole film feel like a corny 40's cartoon.
Overall, this is a fun film with a great cast.",1426377600,,593,4.5514018691588785

4695773,4,B005GYJPYW,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was just OK.  Captain America came across as a symbol, not a real person.  It's like they succeeded too well in demonstrating how he was used to sell savings bonds.  But I just watched it again.  Now that I've seen the Avengers, this movie and Cap the character are a lot more interesting and make a lot more sense. Cap is a real person in The Avengers.  So if you saw the movie when it first came out and were disappointed, you may want to see it again.  Of course, if you were disappointed, you are unlikely to be reading this review.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly recommend that you see The Avengers first.",1426118400,,669,4.2204724409448815

4695821,5,B005GYJPYW,"When I was growing up, Captain America wasn't my favorite hero.  His powers struck me as rather generic, and his schtick was dressing up as a flag.

That said, this movie is awexome!

I love that they show Steve Rogers journey as a weakling with a fighting spirit who just wants to do what is right.  Then you see his transformation into the Hitler-punching hero.

I especially love how they treated Bucky; in the comics, Bucky was a 15-year old sidekick, basically Cap's version of Robin.  But who in their right mind would let a 15-year old go into combat?  Instead, they make Bucky Cap's best friend growing up, and later war buddies.

Were there some weaknesses?  Sure!  For example, the ending (SPOILER ALERT!).  Cap doesn't actually defeat the Red Skull.  Instead, Skull is sucked into some wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey vortex, and will likely rematerialize in future Marvel films; and even if he doesn't, he's gone, but not because Cap squarely beat him.  I would have liked to see Cap take him down.

Also, I know that, because of the framing device, you can't really end with him still stuck in the ice.  But still, the SHIELD ending felt a little rushed.  You don't really get the sense of him being ""a man out out time"" until The Avengers and Winter Soldier.  Still, it does make an excellent origin story for the First Avenger, and it does a great job of capturing both the WWII spirit, as well as the science fiction feel of the superhero genre.

Also, Clara Oswald shows up; a little late for The Daleks Take Manhattan, and on the wrong side of the ocean for Victory of the Daleks.  I blame the Tesseract.",1424563200,,1616,4.5874125874125875

It also provides insight into other characters whose legacies are front and center in the second installment, ""The Winter Soldier"" and the first ""Avengers"" film. I actually saw ""The Winter Soldier"" prior to ""The First Avenger"" and though seeing it in the reverse would probably have been a better way to view them, I am not disappointed nor do I feel cheated; I actually liked getting the background and many of the questions I had after ""Winter Soldier"" answered after the fact, it allowed me to create my own flashbacks.",1424390400,,635,4.781818181818182

4695838,3,B005GYJPYW,"I liked this movie, but it does have problems (only my opinion).

 1.) Red Skull is portrayed as having his own scheme, his own program separate from the Third Reich, & he's depicted as a third way guy.  Personally I did not like this portrayal because in the comic book he was a right hand man to Hitler himself, and he is sworn to the Nazi ideology & the Third Reich in total.  He would not go on his own program, & thus making his character separate from the crusade of the Allies in real life world history diminishes the righteous & noble cause of Captain America standing up for a free nation against Fascist tyranny.

2.) Did not care for the ""Star Wars"" space age future weapons in the 1940's!  If they would have just kept the weapons as they were to the period it would have made the film and the hero more believable, throwing in fantasy sci fi weapons in a time when clearly they could not have ever existed makes the movie more campy and cartoonish.

  Chris Evans does a very good job portraying young idealistic Steve Rogers who wants to join the Army from New York, & has been picked on as a youth because of his thin & short size.  He runs into a noble German American scientist who helps turn him into the world's first ""Super Soldier"" Avenger transforming him from a weak bodied person to a macho muscle bound athletic stud.

  The ""cosmic cube"" plot moving device did not fully convince me, even though the device is used through out the Avengers franchise series, it reminded me too much of the similar device used in the ""Transformers.""

 Tommy Lee Jones as always is good in every film he is in, & made the film a bit more believable.

  I enjoyed the action & visual special effects of the film, but interestingly enough this movie's sequel is actually a lot better.

 Did like the scenes where the Captain takes on the Red Skull in a German built super stealth bomber plane, the visuals in those scenes were very well done and enjoyable to see.

Worth your time if you are a sci fi, or super hero fan.  But certainly not a masterpiece by any means.",1424217600,,2073,4.371727748691099

4695863,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger, though it is the most clearest prequel to the blockbuster hit Avengers, it stands out above the rest. Because not only was it a super-hero movie, but it was a period-piece.

I've often wished this for many of the super-hero movies, but for some reason hollywood thinks the winning formula is taking superheroes out of their time (when they were made) and transplanting them to contemporary time. While I admit that is interesting in some instances, seeing Captain America around when he was made (in WW2) for me, I hope, has opened the door for the day when a 1939, 1940s Batman period-piece could be on the big screen, or a 1930s Superman.

I see that the X-men franchise has taken a hint and has done movies with X-men's original period in the 60s.

Though Captain A. was great in Avengers, and the Winter Soldier was a good movie, I found his first movie to be the best because it wasn't afraid to keep the superhero in his own originally-planned time, and still make a great movie. Again, I hope superhero movie makers take a hint and try that with others.",1422921600,,1096,4.581632653061225

Cap was a crime fighter that was converted to a Nazi fighter in war era comic books. The 2011 version of Captain America continued the war time comic book adventures. I thought that the movie was fantastic. It is a wonderful popcorn movie and it was very exciting to see how 1944 era automobiles, tanks and weapons were portrayed. I always loved the look of these futuristic things looked in the serials of the 1940's. I was born in 1948 and grew up watching movies from the thirties and forties. I am fascinated by that period of time and as an older adult, I honor all Americans that fought in that war and the women that worked in the war factories.

As far as the movie itself, it took great liberties with social issues and technology that we know never existed back in the World War II days; but if you believe that a man can be injected with a super-serum and become a super-hero with super-strength, then you can believe that they had integrated military units and British women leading American troops to battle.",1420243200,,609,4.4774774774774775

I was impressed with the period details, especially the song and dance routine of the USO show which really brought back the 1940's movies I watched as a child.  The script made the corny naivete of an old-fashioned ""super"" hero believable and kept the unbelievable acrobatics of a modern action movie down to a dull roar.

This film is beautifully shot with warm hues and scenes, the look of the 40s with the clothes, hair, make-up and lighting is excellent. Hayley Atwell is perfect for Agent Carter, and Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious. With a great musical score by Alan Silvestri, this is Marvel's best- although I will have to admit if you think about all the Marvel heroes, his is one of the saddest stories.

THE FIRST AVENGER

As a lifelong comic book fan I was very excited when this film first came out. I had seen all of the other Cap films from back in the day and was all about a new one. I also knew that this one would be good since Chris Evans was excellent in another comic movie called The Losers, even liked him in the Fantastic Four films.

This is the origin story so we get to see Steve Rogers from the little weak guy everyone thought he was transform into one of the greatest heroes ever. But even as a weak looking guy he shows his heart and courage throughout even before taking the super solider serum. Once he does all bets are off for the enemy, the Red Skull and Hydra. So it is up to Cap to save the world for the first time, little does he know what the future holds for him.

This was such a good movie and one of the best that Marvel has put out. Chris Evans is excellent as Rogers/Cap and brings everything to the roll that one would expect from the Cap. Director Joe Johnson did a great job with this film as did the writers. The material was taken seriously but still had that fun comic feel to it. The casting was perfect as everyone in it was great as we have come to love about the Marvel films.

This is such a fun film full of action, comedy and everything else including a great villain in the Red Skull. On top of that the Blu Ray is full of extras like a wonderful commentary, behind the scenes and making of features and of course a great Marvel One Shot. I would highly recommend this film to any movie fan out there.",1417737600,,1564,4.101307189542483

4696008,4,B005GYJPYW,"Excellent origin story with clearly-developed characters, plenty of action and not too heavy with the CG. This felt like a very respectful translation of the comic book character, with careful attention given to his background and history, his early years, plenty of colorful action and eventually the event that, albeit a little implausible, brings him to the modern era. Chris Evan's captures the role well, and I hope he continues to act in this series and he's a readily-identifiable actor to play Cap. Much like the Winter Soldier there's an excellent story here that holds your interest. It's not quite all-ages, as there is plenty of action and violence, but not much in terms of language or adult content, which I appreciated in keeping this character consistent.",1417392000,,771,5.078740157480315

The movie was great, don't get me wrong but it was spectacular or not even something that I'd consider class. If anything Kubrick's movies should go for this much. I'm just confused.

4696151,4,B005GYJPYW,"As a fan of WWII movies, this appealed to me even though I was never a super-huge fan of Captain America.  This is the perfect set-up to The Avengers, as the MacGuffin of this film (the Tesseract) is also the MacGuffin of the Avengers.  It also sets the stage for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe theme of ""good guys chasing powerful glowing thingies"" (ie the Red Thingie from Thor 2 and the Purple Thingie of Guardians of the Galaxy).

Chris Evans truly sells himself as the ""aw, shucks, do-right"" guy, and the movie tells his story perfectly.  (Not having read the original books, as a moviegoer I found the story perfect... so... grain of salt there.)  They don't want a ""good soldier"", they want a good MAN.  If Captain America is just a strong dude in a blue suit to you, give this movie a try.  It adds great dimension to the character, and is essential viewing for background of The Avengers and even recent episodes of Agents of SHIELD.  It also goes without saying, but this is essential for viewing prior to Captain America 2, which may be more appealing to some based on its present-day setting.  It won't mean as much without watching this one first.",1412208000,7,1166,4.5673076923076925

He is continuously rejected for enlistment because of his frail, sickly physique. Dr. Erskine, a scientist, notices Steves extraordinary courage and determination, which leads the doctor to select Steve as the primary candidate for Project Rebirth.

Project Rebirth is a military project to create a perfect soldier with superhuman strength. After undergoing the experimental transformation, Steve emerges as the dreamily chiseled super soldier, Captain America. As Captain America, it is his job to take down the Nazi science organization, HYDRA, and help America to victory in the war.

Captain America was produced by Marvel studios and earned a domestic gross of $176,654,505. Prior to this film, Marvel Studios produced The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, and Iron Man 2. With its old time charm and historical World War II setting, Captain America was the first Marvel Studios movie to stray away from the typical superhero narrative. This film, unlike Marvels previous films, placed an emphasis on Steves transformation, showing how his determination took him from weak and eager to strong and courageous.

Captain America: The First Avenger is an intriguing action movie. Many superhero movies overdo the action scenes, but not this movie. Marvel Studios did a brilliant job of making sure the storyline kept up with the action. The light humor keeps the movie cheery even as the world faces one of its greatest, most devastating wars.
Captains romantic interest, Peggy Carter, is feisty and sweet by turns as their romance blossoms. Even though Steve transforms from zero to hero, he remains true to himself regardless of his new pumped-up muscles and strong jawline. The Captain remains simple throughout the movie. He is simple in the best of ways. He is a superhero without all the glitz of being a billionaire or an alien from another planet or. He is a reflection of what is good and noble about humankind, showing that if its in their heart, anyone can be a hero.

While the action scenes were not overdone, they seemed slight. It would have added an extra element of suspense if more of the rivalry between HYDRA leader Red Skull and Captain America were played out on the big screen. Because Im a sucker for romance, I would have enjoyed seeing more of the relationship between Captain and Peggy. But because Captain America is a comic-book-action movie and not a romance film, it makes sense that their romance was not the main focus.
If you are planning on watching Marvel Studios The Avengers, you should first watch Captain America and the other superhero movies produced by Marvel Studios. Watching these first will help you to gain a better understanding of the characters that comprise the Avengers.

Anyone who loves action, superheroes, or America will enjoy this movie. Its perfect for a date night, family movie night, boys night, and even girls night (ladies, have you seen Chis Evans?). This film will make you feel proud to be an American. And if you are not an American, it will make you wish you were.",1409529600,2,3211,4.994392523364486

4696316,3,B005GYJPYW,"Welcome to the next generation of superhero movie. Captain America: The First Avenger may usher in a
new era of super storytelling. But thats only if writers can be heroes saving helpless stories from the
evils of overdone special effects.
This story starts with Steve Rogers, a scrawny guy often bullied during World War II. He wants so badly
to fight against Nazis that he fakes a handful of applicationsonly to be turned down each time for a
laundry list of ailments. Rogers is played by Chris Evans, a bulky actor who through special effects is
brilliantly shrunk in the first part of this movie to the puny soldier wanna-be.
Rogers is befriended by scientist, Dr. Abraham Erskine (played by Stanley Tucci), who has invented a
special serum that should create an army of super soldiers, and he has been looking for a first subject
with depth of character (not just muscles). The experiment goes well, as we see Evans transformed from
skinny to his more natural superhero build. But the experiment is sabotaged by German spies, and Dr.
Erskine is killed along with any possibility of duplicating the serum.
The new soldiers first commission is far from the battlefield as he is enlisted to perform on stage for
audiences across the U.S. to sell war bonds. It isn't until the performances go overseas to entertain
troops that he gets a chance to be a true herosaving several hundred troops captured by forces of the
deranged Nazi named Johan Schmidt (played by Hugo Weaving). It turns out Schmidt was a colleague of
Erskine before war, and he is the only other human to have had an injection of super serum.
The first one-third of Captain America was excellentwell written, interesting concepts, expert
execution. Somewhere along the way, it becomes another shoot em up without nearly as much story
finesse (but still worthy enough to see). Captain America will join fellow big screen stars Iron Man, Hulk,
and Thor in a new movie next summer called The Avengers. Lets hope make the story super before
anything else.",1408406400,,2018,4.835260115606936

4696514,5,B005GYJPYW,"A lot of people thought this was the weak link to Marvel's Phase 1 films (and The Incredible Hulk), but I love the origin story.  Joe Johnston did a great job of re-capturing the 40's time period and WWII.",1403654400,,205,4.256410256410256

4696516,3,B005GYJPYW,"This movie has a throwback plot and style similar to Indiana Jones or the Austin Powers spoofs of this era. It isn't terrible, but it's my second least favorite Marvel film. The director portrays Captain's innocence and the simplicity of running after a silly cartoonish bad guy and fighting him in a burning building.

Plot and directing aside, Chris Evans and the rest of the cast did a great job. It's also worth noting that the technology design work (especially Schmidt's car) are top notch.

In contrast to this film's shortcomings, the sequel is very well done! I recommend sitting through this one for the back story before watching Captain America 2.",1403568000,,659,4.875
4696517,4,B005GYJPYW,"I never was huge on super hero movies when I was younger and now I'm obsessed. Honestly, when this first came out I thought it looked boring as it was just some guy who was a little faster and stronger than other people with a shield. He still remains my least favorite avenger. My boyfriend told me that it was his ability to do tactics and plan that also made him special. I watched it because he wouldn't let me see The Avengers first and I really liked it. I still stand by he is the most lame Avenger, but it was a good movie overall! I showed it to my parents too.",1403481600,,570,4.053097345132743
4696518,4,B005GYJPYW,"Those of us ancient enough to remember the original superhero incarnations always look at these ""resurrections"" with a jaundiced eye.  Joe Johnston, Kevin Feige, and writers Markus and McFeely put more than a little heart and effort into this one. The result is not only proverbial ""action-adventure entertainment"" but deepwater exploration into the nature of human good and evil.

The premise is that a 4-F with a good heart is transformed by science into the man he ought to be: an ubermensch whose capabilities match his conscience.  Thus armored in soul and body he sallies forth to battle pure evil - the Red Skull of Hydra, who seems ready to outdo Hitler and take over the Evil Empire for himself.  The reconstruction of time, place and culture is superb, especially as contrasted to his end-film resurrection in the 21st century.  The humility of his transition from circus performer to action hero is also poignant, and necessary: a modern audience tends to mock men in tights who wrap themselves in the flag, just as the frontline soldiers who initially reject the CA shtick.  It takes a crisis to make Captain America more than a clown image.

That said, there are a few rather absurdist premises in the film.  Blacks or Native Americans of the period might have a problem with a white man in flag-drag symbolizing a force for good throughout the world, when experience at home teaches differently.  The defected German scientist would, in reality, have been as Nazi as the bad one allied with Red Skull, turning a new leaf only through the losing course of war.  And CA's stint as a USO performer would have been unnecessary - the whole operation in ""real life"" would have been conducted under the OSS, the CIA's predecessor.  There'd have been no qualms about using a natural bully for genetic guinea pig.

As a good if old-fashioned gung-ho war film, and a probe into the human psyche, this effort is one of the better recreations of the comic-book genre: not a satire, not self-righteous, and not ""dark.""  I haven't yet seen the sequel.  I hope it doesn't trash this original effort too badly.",1403395200,,2108,4.803324099722992

But after seeing Iron Man 3 (my fav), I decided to watch this on DVD.  I'm glad I did.  It was much better than I expected and filled in a gap in the Avenger movie series that I didn't quite understand before.  Capt, is a good ol' boy and the movie is a nice blend of old and new.

Well I am happy to report that they certainly maximize the shield's potential, far exceeding my expectations. I love Chris Evans in this role. He is truly believable as Steve Rogers: America's most badas! boyscout. The character is everything we wish we could be ourselves. Probably the only superhero who I wish actually existed. Great supporting cast. Actors like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving really lend credibility to the comic book movie genre. The movie also has a nice lead into the Avengers. There are certainly times when the film is little more than typical, but overall a good product.",1401580800,5,700,4.745901639344262

He's just a tiny weakling with the courage and heart of a giant until miraculously he is transformed into the hunk he was meant to be. Hugo Weaving is a marvelous villain with his incisive glares and confident stomping, menace. Tommy Lee Jones is self satisfied and then has to eat crow. Hayley Atwell is a forties style tough broad with a soft spot for our guy. And Howard Stark is there! All the players are perfectly cast and complete the melting pot.

But in casting Chris Evans, both as his weaker, smaller self, and his later buff self, they made a perfect match. He is capable of playing a moral icon with a touch of self-deprecating humor that is endearing. I have been interested in his performance career since Push. He is never boring to watch.",1400976000,,465,4.614457831325301

He just seemed kinda goofy.  This movie will definitely make me check out some comics to see what his story is all about.

For me, his origin story is great because it's something that could really happen.  So many comic book hero stories get caught up in meet hero A, something happens and hero gets powers, hero learns to use new powers while keeping them a secret, meet villain A, villain A knows how to kill hero A because of his weakness.

4696619,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America has reminded us that something has been missing in this country of late.  He is a stark contrast to the anti-hero who has been so fashionable for the past 30 years.  Yes, there really have been people like this in character, if not in physical prowess.  You know, it really is OK to be a Boy Scout.  If Marvel decides to kill off this Cap, I will personally boycott all of their products ever after.  This character wears very well.  Sometimes we have to pretend that a comic story line just did not happen, ignore it, and hope for the best.  Captain America is a keeper.

As an action flick, it is top notch.  Not much to criticize.  Super effects.  Chris Evans is Cap to a T.  Hugo Weaving is excellent, as ever.  Stanley Tucci , just superb!  Loved the rest of the cast.",1399939200,2,789,4.315068493150685

4696626,4,B005GYJPYW,"A great way to catch up on the series and it so well explains how the character's frame of mind came to be.  While an almost understated part of the special effects, I couldn't get over how well they did with making the character seem so small prior to his conversion to his hero physique.
The critics were right.  This is a surprisingly good (and feel-good) movie.  Even my wife, who normally prefers dog and cat movies, thought this was a good movie!",1399593600,,452,4.421686746987952

4696628,2,B005GYJPYW,"I wanted to like this movie; I liked the ""look"" of it in stills and previews, and the main actor was likable enough. The actor for the villain is one I really like too.

The effects and art direction couldn't save the dumb story, though... Lots of explosions and impossible chase scenes have through attrition become the same as a background image these days, and there just wasn't anything to latch onto in this movie:

There was no mystery, there was no interesting story of the villain's motivation, there was no interesting gadgets, there were few gorgeous vistas. Captain America's ""powers"" seem dull, and it's not clear whether he's invincible or merely very very lucky. And this shield... amazing how it always flies back in a circle to him no matter how many things it bounces off of.

The actor played him with good heart, though he never actually seems vulnerable at all, despite the whole ""weakling with a gift"" storyline. They TRIED to give him something sad with the plotline of his buddy, but it seemed forced and added, as opposed to part of the story. The love story was predictable and tiresome, and the performances from ancillary characters dumb and wooden.

I really wanted to like this, and I was prepared to give it a lot of leeway; it's a comic after all. I love a good dumb Nazi conspiracy cartoon with robots and occultism and mutants and giant saucer-like airplanes... But even on those terms, it was boring.

Bummer. And I just wasted 10m writing about it to-boot ;-)

You might like it, just don't expect very much. Even for super-hero movies, it's pretty dumb.",1399593600,,1589,4.697841726618705

4696644,5,B005GYJPYW,"Remember that 97-pound weakling who always gets sand kicked in his face? Well, in this movie scientists change him into a big manly man because he respects strength, unlike guys who have always been strong. We see that our hero may be scrawny, but he's brave, patriotic and tenacious..the very traits those scientists are looking for.

It's a challenge to find a politically correct villain, so Nazis, lacking their own anti-defamation league, are a handy target for this Marvel Comics- based 3D CGI fest. Get ready for storm troopers, vintage warfare, Stealth bombers (?!) and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.

Let's look at the troops:
  * Chris Evans (""The Nanny Diaries"" the Harvard Hottie) seems so darned LIKABLE! He is a perfect Captain America, object of derision, exploitation and ultimately, adulation.
  * Hayley Atwell (""The Duchess"" the Other Woman) can run with WWII troops and shoot a machine gun without wearing a helmet, which would muss her hair.
  * Tommy Lee Jones (""The Company Men"" the crabby guy) is a skeptical Army top kick with all the funny lines.
  * Stanley Tucci (""Burlesque"" Cher's loyal sidekick) is the wise scientist who selects our 97-pound weakling.
  * Derek Luke (""Antwone Fisher"" he was Antwone) is one of our hero's loyal cadre of troopers.
  * Samuel L. Jackson (""Thor"" he was the surprise cameo at the end) is once again the surprise cameo at the end.
  * Dominic Cooper (""Mamma Mia!"" he was the callow bridegroom) his character founded Stark Enterprises: he's Iron Man's father!
  * Hugo Weaving (""The Matrix"" the villain) is, once again, a dastardly power monger who even out-Hitlers Hitler.
  * Toby Jones (""Infamous"" he was Truman Capote) is the villain's toady.

I was impressed by the seamless CGI integration of our hero's head on a puny adolescent body at the beginning of the film. The story is involving but not complicated; the language is PG-13 and often funny; there are no sweaty bodies or car chases; but I only ducked once, so to me, the 3D is optional.

I enjoy seeing characters from other Marvel Comics who appear here, and the final scene is a blatant setup for the next chapter of this fledgling franchise. Amazon will help me own the set.",1399420800,,2197,4.818181818181818

I seem to like about one-third of them.  For example, I thought the first Ironman movie was okay, but the next two were terrible.  I thought the much praised Avengers movie was nonsense.

I recently saw the first Thor movie & thought it wasn't too bad, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  Not very good.  The combination of putting high technology in a WWII story seemed off.  In some ways, the story just seemed an unsubstantial way of depositing Capt. America in the 21st century so they could make more Marvel movies that would stick closer to their core story lines.

This movie does a great job depicting Captain America's origins and showing the 1940s and how life in that time largely shaped the man who would become the famous first superhero.

The characters are great and played by fantastic actors including Tommy Lee Jones as a grumpy general, Richard Armitage (Thorin in the Hobbit movies now) as a German spy/assassin, Haley Atwell as the tough, but kind Peggy Carter, Sebastian Stan as the loyal and protective Bucky Barnes, oh, and can't forget Lord Elrond, I mean Hugo Weaving as the villain, Red Skull!  Chris Evans as Captain America also does a splendid job of making the title character three dimensional and a real person.

This is a great film, with action and heart, but sadly a little rushed to get Captain America to the future.  I think that is my only complaint.  The film was geared toward Captain America winding up in the future in time to take command of the Avengers and it.  Its a little choppy as a result and we don't really get to see Steve fighting in the war as Captain America.  Doesn't change that this is a fun film and a good installment in the Marvel superhero franchise.",1398124800,,1251,4.654545454545454

It is worth watching if you're into captain america in general or at least the universe as related to the recent and upcoming avengers movies. Also worth watching before the latest captain america movie which I enjoyed very much. The most glaring annoyance is that a lot of the enemies (the unimportant minions) were implausibly bad at fighting. Many of them got taken out by captain america because they were RUNNING RIGHT AT HIM instead of shooting at him when they had plenty of time to do so or simply chose not to run at him when they already had a gun. Chris Evans looks cool and his choreography was good, but the enemies were just too... stupid. It took me out of the moment.",1397865600,,779,4.492957746478873

I love them all but somehow Captain America has become my favorite. And now, most especially, I love this movie! Full of action, a great story, but best of all, great characters. Steve Rogers has a wonderful heart and soul. We need more heros like him...Even if the real ones can't jump out of a plane without a parachute!

4696828,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a great addition to the burgeoning Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, and a great comic book movie, and an awesome action film in general. It certainly atones for the past sins of the Captain, mainly brief and disastrous sojourns in the 70s and one in the 90s. Google it if ye dare!

This film, unlike many screen interpretations of Cap which often jump straight to modern-day heroics, was wisely done as a period piece, set in the twilight hours of World War II. We see Steve Rogers before he dons the red, white, and blue, and therefore become much more invested in his character before he was a Super Soldier. Great performances are to be had all around. Chris Evans gets Steves humility and all-around good guy charm. The ideals and attitude shown here prove that this was the Greatest Generation. Hayley Atwell does fine as Caps interest Peggy Carter, and here shes in the army as well, putting her in the action instead of the girlfriend back home as she is normally shown, and also oddly British for some reason. Tommy-Lee Jones is as entertaining as one could expect as Army General Tommy-Lee Jones. Yeah, its one of those roles, but in a good way. Likewise, Hugo Weaving is great as German Hugo Weaving. But seriously, Weaving was a great choice for Caps eternal nemesis the villainous Red Skull. As a villain, Red Skull is pretty standard and doesnt offer many surprises (even the face reveal was coming a mile away). Toby Jones did good as scientist Arnim Zola, and there was a cool easter egg of his comic appearance. Stanley Tucci shows his acting versatility as Dr. Abraham Erskine. All of the Howling Commandos (sans Nick Fury, contrary to comic tradition) are great too.

One of the criticisms of this film is that it is a full-length feature ad for The Avengers. Well, there definitely was one after the credits, and it is in the title. The McGuffin of the movie exists to set up The Avengers, but despite all this, I believe it holds up on its own as an origin story of one of Marvels oldest and greatest heroes. The set-up is well paced and the action scenes deliver on the awesomeness, particularly Caps signature shield throwing. There is an unfortunate montage that glazes over much of the battles between the good guys and bad guys, but thats really my only major gripe with the film. There is a suspension of disbelief that must be had in the plot, but not to the point where it breaks, and the source material forces much of it.

Overall, Captain America delivers as a great superhero film. It is in many ways a set-up for The Avengers, but its a good set-up that can stand on its own.",1396915200,,2646,4.578059071729958

4696852,3,B005GYJPYW,"I really do like everything about this movie, I just think they tried to cram SO MUCH in the movie that it kind of took way too long to get going.

4696867,5,B005GYJPYW,"The Winter Soldier is out now - loved it - but I still don't understand why The First Avenger didn't get more love from critics and audiences. Maybe it came out too late in a superhero-saturated summer. It got good reviews generally speaking and did well enough at the box office, but it seems to have been viewed as an also-ran. Some wrote it off as a 'prequel' to The Avengers. It's a terrific self-contained origin story. Tommy Lee Jones does exactly what we expect of him - and does it well, at that. Stanley Tucci delivers a touching supporting role as the first person to truly believe in Steve Rogers. Hugo Weaving never crosses the line into ""over the top"" territory as the Red Skull. The will-they-or-won't-they romantic subplot between Chris Evans and Haley Atwell is nicely subtle.

The only thing I think should've been done differently: the scene with Nick Fury at the end should've been saved as a post-credits scene. The ""real"" ending of the movie - poignant and understated - should've been directly followed by the credits.",1396656000,2,1040,4.745856353591161

It's visually appealing. Set design is gorgeous. The characters are larger than life. The action never stops. Beyond the explosions and excitement, though, the humanity of Captain America continues to shine through.

He isn't an anti-hero killing bad guys because he can, instead he is defending freedoms, doing what is right, and showing heroism by being willing to give his life for others and by leading others on the front-lines.  I also appreciate the fact that even before his super soldier status he was shown to be willing to stand up to bullies even knowing he was going to get hurt.  IMO all of these traits combined make for a true hero.",1396656000,,549,4.300970873786408

4696882,4,B005GYJPYW,"Out of all the movies in phase one of the MCU (Iron Man, Thor, Iron Man 2, etc.)  Captain American The First Avenger is the one I was looking forward to the least.  Captain America as a character never interested me that much.  I liked him the Ultimate Avengers animated movies, but I liked most the other superheroes on the team more.  I will say that the film is the one of my least favorite phase one movies.  However, that does not make Captain America bad.  I still thought the film was entertaining and Chris Evans did surprise me.  I thought he was bad in Fantastic 4 so I had little hope here.  However, he was able to pull-off the character rather nicely.

The story is as follows.  A man named Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to be a great soldier but gets gravely dismissed and underestimated because of his size.  He then volunteers for an experiment which makes him a Super Soldiers known as Captain America.  He then joins the Special Forces to fight the Nazi organization called HYDRA led by another Super Soldier called Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).  He is joined by his sidekicks Bucky Barnes, Peggy Carter, and Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones).

The film does accomplish most of what it is set out to do.  Captain America is an entertaining character especially when he is throwing his shield around.  The action scenes are decent although not up-to-par with action scenes in Iron Man, Thor, or Incredible Hulk.  The side characters are decent especially Colonel Phillips.  Tommy Lee Jones is great in every role he plays, even if the film itself is bad.  I really liked his character, and he was quite funny.  The majority of the funny moments in the film involve him.

The one issue I have is the CGI in the film.  The CGI is not horrible, but there are times when it is off particularly in the fights and it can take me out.  Compared to the effects in Iron Man and Thor, the effects in this are not up-to-par.  Also, the film can drag a little in places, but that is more of a nitpick.

Overall, Captain America is an entertaining film and worth your time.  If you are getting into the MCU and want to see Avengers then you should watch this film (as well as the other phase one films) first to get more of an understanding.  It is one of my least favorite phase one movies but it is still good.  I can definitely say I like it better than Iron Man 2.",1396569600,,2380,4.409195402298851
4696883,4,B005GYJPYW,"Marvel is a successful franchise not only because of the creativity of the writers/animators, but also due to uniqueness of their characters. One example would be The First Avenger himself, Captain America.

We meet a man by the name of Johann Schmidt a man clearly overly obsessed with the wrong types of things. Soon later, Steve Rogers is introduced to us and though he is a smaller person, he has quite the big eye for the military. Unfortunately, he is not fit to join. But after being offered a chance to be something greater than even Steve could have possibly imagined, he immediately accepts and so begins his journey.

The movie itself gets a definite stamp of approval in my book. Chris Evans is the right man for the task of bringing Captain America to life in the movie. His gratuitous, audacious attitude is the blueprint behind the costume; and the fight for what is right is clear. Sebastian Stan also had a notable stand in his role as Bucky Barnes. As for our villain, Hugo Weaving shows range and defiance here well; and in the end he portrays the Red Skull with skill.

So before I get completely carried away, I will say that Captain America is a great origin movie and a wonderful superhero at that. If you have not seen this one, give a watch because it is well worth the time. Captain America: The First Avenger gets:

Surprise surprise when the name Stark came up. I found Chris Evans portrayal charming. And the action was lots of fun. Loved some of the one liner zingers. Like when being awakened he says I'm late for a date. It left me eager to watch some of the other movies such as Thor. And I think I need to see The Avengers again.

4696906,4,B005GYJPYW,"The Avengers is a new and wonderful movie franchise bringing together some of the best and brightest of the Marvel universe.  The movie is wonderful -- but I found myself confused.

That is, until I rented Captain America when many of the most confusing parts of The Avengers suddenly became much more clear.

Set during WWII, Captain America is about Steve Rogers, a young man from Brooklyn the military refuses to enlist -- no matter how many times he tries.  That is until a military scientist gives Rogers his chance to serve -- if he qualifies for and agrees to being part of a top secret experiment.  That experiment transforms Rogers into Captain America, giving Rogers the chance to make a difference he's waited for all his life.

In this movie, a lot of pieces from The Avengers becomes clear.  You meet Howard Stark (Iron Man Tony Stark's father), are introduced to the Terresect, and see how Rogers becomes encased in the ice we first see him in at the start of The Avengers.  You also come to really understand the Iron Man verses Captain America dynamic so brilliantly played between Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr as all the references in their banter come into focus.

Essential for any Avengers fan.

One caveat for those not familiar with 1940s America:  the movie is rich with the American patriot hype and propaganda that was so much a part of 1940s American culture.  It can come off as over the top if you do not know much about this time period -- but is absolutely true to period.",1395705600,3,1506,4.599250936329588

4696944,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is not a story about an American. Its not a story about a soldier. Its not even a story about a superhero. Its a story about a hero, plain and simple. Where most comic book superhero films follow the formula of selfish John Doe gains powers, uses powers for selfish purposes, tragedy strikes, John Doe uses powers to correct things, Captain America changes things up in a refreshing way by having our main character already embody everything a hero should be before getting the power to prove it.

Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, The Losers) is already a good man, a hero in his heart. He only lacks the abilities to change the world around him. When Hitler begins his sweep across Europe in World War II, Steve is unable to enlist due to his sickly nature. Despite this, he tries to join the army in several different cities using aliases knowing going to war would probably mean his death soon after. This is the sign of a hero: the willingness to do what is right despite the danger to ones self. Is Superman a hero when he stops a mugging? No more than I am a hero for stomping on a spider to protect my wife. But Steve Rogers would gladly lay down his body to protect the little man from what he considers bullies, be they in a back alley or in a tank overseas.

Evans does a great job of portraying weak Steve Rogers and buff Captain America. When he was first cast, I was convinced this movie was not going to work. Chris Evans was too young and too much of a pretty boy to convince me he could be a leader of men. He certainly wasn't someone that Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man would respect enough in next summers The Avengers. Personally I was pulling for Human Targets Mark Valley.  But through a combination of Evans charisma and Joe Johnstons direction, my opinion was changed. Somehow Evans manages to keep the aw shucks attitude of Steve Rogers while inspiring his Howling Commandos (and the audience) as Cap.

The filmmakers do a good job of not belittling the real history behind World War II and dishonoring those brave men and women who fought and died during the war. Captain America does not win the war for the Allies, but instead fights on a second front against a fringe section of the Nazis (as if it were possible to be even more insane than Hitlers regime).  When this movie is released over seas, I really hope that foreign viewers get that, and can see it for the fun alternate history that it is.

The First Avenger is a great movie on its own, but it is only enhanced by having seen the other Marvel films that will eventually tie together in The Avengers. It is especially served by Thor tying in to Hitlers and the Red Skulls (Hugo Weaving- The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings) infatuation with mythology and the occult. Its also a veritable Easter egg hunt for fans of the comics. Sharp-eyed viewers will see lots subtle shout outs to the true geeks, while many of the eggs are right there in the audiences face whether they know it or not. As much as I want to talk about them, I want viewers to be able to find them for themselves like I did (but if you want to compare notes sometime, shoot me an email).

Captain America: The First Avenger was my most anticipated movie of the summer, yes, even more so than Harry Potter (though it was a very close race).  Every trailer I saw got me more and more excited until I was sure that I could only be disappointed. Thankfully I got exactly what I came for: a film that thrilled me like a war movie combined with the swashbuckling of Indiana Jones. Luckily we only need to wait one year to see Captain America in action again. Is it too early to start counting down the days to The Avengers?

I guess by going back to the beginning of the formation of the Avengers really helped give a sense of the breadth of the Marvel Universe they were creating for larger Avengers movie series. The story of hero Steve Rogers was a nice flipside of the snarky Tony Stark plus there are the connections to Thor and as a product of the government the connections to Stark's and maybe Bruce Banner's characters all start with THIS movie. A great production design and direction by Joe Johnston - Lucas/Spielberg and ILM vet - really gives this a ""Indiana Jones superhero movie"" energy.

4696969,4,B005GYJPYW,"This movie is great with all of the action and super hero feel. Although, with the time period being World War II, I would have liked it better to keep the feel of that a little bit instead of totally going out with lasers that vaporize people.",1391040000,,244,4.212765957446808
4696970,5,B005GYJPYW,It is action packed along with a bit of historical references and a touch of romance all in all a good movie pick,1391040000,,113,3.9565217391304346

But, if you loved Marvel superheroes as a kid (or even now), couldn't wait to get the latest from Stan Lee, then you will be happy with this one. It took a little while for the FX to do these Marvel heroes justice but now that it's here, it's great! If you missed it on the big screen, do yourself a favor and see it on blu ray. You'll be glad you did.",1390867200,,509,3.9514563106796117

4696979,5,B005GYJPYW,It goes without saying that Capt. America is a true American hero and icon but this film that shares his origins and first adventure as a super soldier is the basis for what is sure to be an incredible movie franchise.,1390867200,,218,4.341463414634147

It really makes you feel like you are watching a film from that time period, but yet at the same time knowing that it is a modern story. The amount  of violence is tempered due to the feel of the film. It is one of the only Marvel avenger's character films the whole family can see.",1390262400,,382,4.162162162162162

Up until then I had a kid crush on Superman, but Captain America blew him away, because he was human, he never gave up, he never surrendered. I thought his shield was great, too.  The actor playing Captain America has him down pat.  It doesn't hurt he's easy on the eyes as well.  The movie has a couple of choppy spots that I put down to picking up a new book, then following along with ease.  Glad I added this to my collection.

4697049,5,B005GYJPYW,A little slow at the start but the pace of the film picks up quickly.  CA was one of my favorite comic book heroes from back in the day.  The special effects showed the full potential of his shield to defeat the over the top villain.,1389225600,,233,4.043478260869565
4697050,5,B005GYJPYW,Spectacular movie with action and tells a good story about values and sticking up to bullies - the one case in which the little man wins...,1389225600,,139,4.384615384615385
4697051,4,B005GYJPYW,This movie was what you typically expect from a superhero movie.  I enjoyed the movie and have watched it a couple of times.,1389225600,,124,4.391304347826087

4697055,4,B005GYJPYW,"I'm not that big into superhero type movies, but Captain America is my favorite out of all the other Avenger superhero movies. I highly recommend watching this movie!",1389139200,,166,4.964285714285714

4697057,5,B005GYJPYW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was also my first Amazon Prime Instant video.  To do this with my non-hdmi HD TV, I had to purchase a hdmi-to-rca converter (PC to TV).  Everything worked great!",1389139200,,198,4.6
4697058,4,B005GYJPYW,"More complex and thoughtful than we had expected, on top of the excellent pacing, special effects, and exciting fight scenes.  Even comes with larger lessons
about strong and weak people.  Would totally recommend for kids.  We bypassed this in the theaters thinking it would be a two-dimensional, patriotism-equals-bombing-people movie (which we generally find morally appalling) but were pleasant surprised when we cycled back after watching Avengers.  It also gave us the backstory explaining the premise of Avengers which was helpful when we watched Avengers again later.",1389139200,,574,5.6395348837209305
4697059,5,B005GYJPYW,Loved the action!  Love the heart of the movie!  Great fun for the family movie night!  Love the time period too.,1389139200,,113,4.285714285714286
4697060,4,B005GYJPYW,Film was well-done and exciting.  Worthwhile watching. Has some unusual aspects that are surprising. Leaves you wanting more of the same.,1389139200,,137,5.523809523809524
4697061,3,B005GYJPYW,Interesting but movie lagged at times.  But gives you a clear view of how Captain America came to be. Watch this before Avengers.,1389139200,,129,4.608695652173913
4697062,2,B005GYJPYW,Stupid story and not well organized. The end is sooo ridiculous. I thought it was a good movie because i saw the avengers which was fun to watch but captain america is just bullsh*t.,1389139200,,182,4.382352941176471
4697063,5,B005GYJPYW,Great hero movie for all ages!  I like Chris Evans and he played the part very well!  We need heroes today!,1389139200,,107,4.0476190476190474

4697067,5,B005GYJPYW,"Yet another film from Marvel which is great.  This was probably the one I least wanted to watch when watching the Marvel universe as was a character I didn't think had any depth, just all red white and blue spangled nonsense BUT was a great film and REALLY enjoyed it.",1389052800,,268,4.36
4697068,5,B005GYJPYW,Just hated that he didn't get to keep his Date! Another Time??? We need more Captian Amercia's in USA .,1389052800,,103,4.2
4697069,5,B005GYJPYW,This is a great movie. I have enjoyed all of the Avenger movies but this one is in my top two. You definitely will want to watch it!!!,1389052800,,134,3.8214285714285716

4697073,5,B005GYJPYW,It's a great story for one. The inspiring tale of the underdog getting his chance to do the right thing for his country. Great effects as well and kept you entertained throughout the movie,1388966400,,188,4.5588235294117645
4697074,5,B005GYJPYW,I wasn't really sure how the movie would be like and you know what I really liked it. I've watched it several times since we got the movie.,1388966400,,139,4.0
4697075,5,B005GYJPYW,"We watched this action film on Saturday night and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  I don't usually go for the ""Acton Figure"" films, but found this to be a very engaging film...lots of action, enjoyable to watch and good positive story line.  (o:",1388966400,,252,4.456521739130435
4697076,5,B005GYJPYW,I love this movie. It is great. I want more like it. It is almost perfection. Great for family fun.,1388966400,,99,4.0
4697077,4,B005GYJPYW,"A bit too much shooting for younger audiences
Special effects for Captain Americas change are AMAZING!
Hugo Weaving is awesome as usual!",1388966400,,136,5.2272727272727275
4697078,4,B005GYJPYW,"I bought this one because of his appearance in ""Avengers."" It's a little slow starting out (though not as grindingly slow as ""Thor"")but enjoyable, and a keeper. Looking forward to the second one in the series. I recommend it.",1388966400,2,225,4.794871794871795
4697079,5,B005GYJPYW,We think this is a great movie.  One of my family's favorites. I recommend it. (Mom of a 7 year old boy.),1388966400,,105,3.772727272727273
4697080,4,B005GYJPYW,Just sit back and enjoy the movie.  The period re-creations are wonderful and the actors are very engaging.  It is just fun.,1388966400,,124,4.590909090909091
4697081,3,B005GYJPYW,"Fun movie but not on the level of, say, ""Iron Man"".  Too many soldiers who can't shoot straight. Otherwise a fun watch.",1388966400,,119,4.409090909090909
4697082,1,B005GYJPYW,"IMO, Nauseating ""'Muricanism"" and virtually no climax. I am surprised Captain America can hear any other character, when he is at altitude on his self-righteous high horse. If he were not a super hero, he might have dislocated his arm patting himself on the back. The whole story was corny, and very predictable. This movie felt like the beginning of an episode in a series, this one being the avengers, where they give a brief synopsis of a character, just so when you watch that episode, you know that character exists. I get it, Captain america is part of the avengers. Also, why does America demonize steroids all the way up until super steroids are used for 'Murica? I guess Cpt. America is a ""Real American."" He must be from the Midwest.",1388880000,,743,4.636363636363637
4697083,5,B005GYJPYW,"It is what you would expect from the Marvel superhero films. However, the nice twist is that the action is primarily set in the 40s to give some context as to how Captain America is relevant in the 21st century. Be sure to stick around after the credits for what has become a standard in the Marvel films, an extra scene at the end. A fun movie.",1388880000,,345,4.164179104477612
4697084,5,B005GYJPYW,It was a great movie and  a heart breaking one too! I guess they did that to have a second Captain America movie in the near future.,1388880000,,132,3.888888888888889
4697085,5,B005GYJPYW,"If you love marvel comics, this is the movie for you.
So if you have not seen, buckle up and enjoy the ride.
Captain America is the ultimate in heroes.",1388880000,,151,4.066666666666666
4697086,5,B005GYJPYW,After seeing the previews for the second Captain America I had to watch this. It is a great movie. Enjoyed the action and it never slowed down.,1388793600,,143,4.333333333333333
4697087,4,B005GYJPYW,Have seen this a few times. Fun to recap and hope that there are many more adventures for the Avenger characters.,1388793600,,113,4.428571428571429
4697088,4,B005GYJPYW,Give me a superhero any day.  It was awesome to see the transformation from this short skinny runt of a fella to the huge muscle-bound hunk that became Capital America.,1388793600,,168,4.6
4697089,4,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was entertaining, a little over the top but that's to be expected with a comic book super hero.
More importantly, it introduces us to the character, how he came to be and how he fits in with today's times.
Worth watching if you're not familiar with Captain America",1388793600,,275,4.52
4697090,4,B005GYJPYW,Chris Evans made it really easy to watch this movie to the end. Not a five star movie but plenty of action.,1388707200,,107,3.909090909090909
4697091,3,B005GYJPYW,The movie was okay.  I think it sends the wrong message to our youth.  by saying that you can take drugs or steroids  and build up your body and have the superhuman strength.,1388707200,,174,4.212121212121212
4697092,5,B005GYJPYW,"Thanks so much, this was a Great Movie.  My husband loved it!  It came as expected, Brand New and without damage!  but was cheaper than in the stores!!",1388707200,,151,4.321428571428571
4697093,5,B005GYJPYW,"My wife did not know who Captain America was, she has sort of heard of the comic book.  She loved this movie and story.  That says it all.",1388707200,,138,3.892857142857143
4697094,4,B005GYJPYW,"Not my favorite superhero movie, but it was still good and entertaining to watch.  Good action, but maybe I just didn't understand it that well, but the bad guy really didn't make that much sense to me, and it could have used more detail as to what gave him his powers.  Or did I just miss that part?",1388707200,,300,4.155172413793103
4697095,4,B005GYJPYW,Fun movie for the family (10 and up). Lots of action! Great morals overcomes great evil. It is a must see.,1388707200,,106,4.095238095238095
4697096,5,B005GYJPYW,a feel good movie with the right balance of action drama and little romance for the main hero. I kinda wish they didn't tease us so much towards the end with the red skull.,1388707200,,172,4.088235294117647
4697097,5,B005GYJPYW,Very good movie. Not to much action but enough to satisfied. I like all the Avengers movies but Captain America is my favorite.,1388707200,,127,4.565217391304348

4697100,5,B005GYJPYW,"Awesome is the only word to describe this movie. I will watch it over and over again, love capt America.",1388620800,,104,4.25
4697101,5,B005GYJPYW,"This film that depicted the origin of Captain America was great because it did not stray too far from the comics.  Seeing the scrawny Steve Rogers attempt (and continuously reattempt) to enlist in the US army during WWII for no other reason besides devotion to the flag and ideals that made the United States what it is showed the classic ""Cap"" mindset that comic books fans have always seen in this hero.  Chris Evans played a believable Captain America throughout the film.  Hugo Weaving played a great Red Skull - a traditional Captain America nemesis.  The brilliant yet unhinged persona shined through in his portrayal.  This was a purely fun, entertaining movie - not one designed to make the viewer think deeply.",1388534400,,719,4.860655737704918
4697102,5,B005GYJPYW,"Like the Avenger stories is why I watched it. I like the movie, it was done in good taste. It was watched on my smart TV and was great.",1388534400,,135,3.689655172413793

4697104,5,B005GYJPYW,Set-up for avenger's but still a great movie. Watched it three times and I still enjoyed it. Keep catching new subtleties each time.,1388534400,,132,4.782608695652174
4697105,5,B005GYJPYW,Great comic book movie and a great World War II movie wrapped into one.  Really awesome job on Marvels part.,1388534400,,108,4.4
4697106,5,B005GYJPYW,"I'm working on the 2nd Captain American at work, so I figured it would be appropriate to see the first one. I thought I heard it wasn't great, but I loved it! Great story AND effects :)",1388448000,,185,4.027027027027027
4697107,1,B005GYJPYW,The 3D was OK but could watch the movie in 2D and it would be just as good.  Not enough special effects for 3D.,1388448000,2,111,3.625

4697110,3,B005GYJPYW,Medium fare for the mind.  Not something you can get into. A bit hokey.  The movie doesn't really have a viable point to make for an adult.,1388361600,,139,4.111111111111111
4697111,5,B005GYJPYW,If you like other Marvel movies you will like this one as well; Great movie that sets the stage for more to come.,1388361600,,113,3.9565217391304346
4697112,4,B005GYJPYW,This is a fun movie to occupy your time.  Another benefit is that all the Avenger movies are on demand.,1388361600,,103,4.15
4697113,4,B005GYJPYW,"Kids enjoyed it.  Violence was not too bad.  They all understood the story and really kept up with it, so I gave it 4 stars.",1388361600,,124,3.92
4697114,5,B005GYJPYW,"The movie was very action packed and depicts Captain America

4697126,4,B005GYJPYW,This movie has grown on me.  The CA character tends to get over shadowed due to Iron Man and Thor.  Watching this movie again after all this time has me pumped about the next installment.,1388016000,,187,4.314285714285714

No unnecessary sex or graphic violence!
A wonderful work of fiction (which all movies are) but Captain America (like all the Marvel movies) does not try to portray a realistic theme!
The humor sprinkled in throughout the movie truly completes its entertainment value!",1388016000,,295,5.434782608695652

4697137,5,B005GYJPYW,"This is an excellent film which provides a nostalgic look at WWII, and manages to avoid pap while conveying Steve Roger's sense of patriotism and honor. The fact that movie happens to include super powers is secondary to the compelling underdog story. When the powers do come into play they appear natural and realistic despite the impressive feats which are depicted. The cinematography, direction, performances, and writing are all top notch. The costumes and makeup are impressive with Captain America's suit and the red dress being standouts. I highly recommend this movie.",1387756800,,577,5.282608695652174

4697139,4,B005GYJPYW,Captain America was a nice light movie with the Hero coming from a once underdog character.  I loved reading these kind of comic books when I was young and this movie was just like the comic super hero type.,1387670400,,207,4.3076923076923075
4697140,3,B005GYJPYW,Plot was abysmal but it has good actors and great special effects.  There are enough entertaining parts (especially by Tommy Lee Jones) that make it fun.  It serves its purpose as character development for the later Avengers movie.,1387584000,,231,5.052631578947368

4697161,4,B005GYJPYW,I read the comics when I was a kid and Captain America was one of my favs. This movie did a good job of showing how he became Captain America.  It explained very well his super powers.  I guess if it had a weakness It would be the romance part. I just didn't buy that he really loved the girl.,1386979200,,293,3.8666666666666667

4697177,5,B005GYJPYW,"Lots of fun.  Can be watched with young children (9 and older, I suggest).  Inspires one to challenge themselves and to choose good over wickedness.",1386547200,,148,4.88
4697178,4,B005GYJPYW,"I was surprised by this movie...it exceeded my expectations, which I admit was low. Also, its content was a good deal different from what I expected. I'm not a movie critic, but I recommend it highly.",1386374400,,200,4.583333333333333

4697182,5,B005GYJPYW,"Originally did not really think I would like this one in the whole Avenger Clan group of movies. But it turns out it was much  better than I thought. I also like the technology meets brute 1940s force and weapons as well as political climate then also.
Good guys duking it out with Thompson SMGs and ACP-1911s against the foes. Wish they could have that Captain Avenger hammer team work together again also in another movie but this one jumped forward so far in time.... good story however.
Note to accuracy enthusiasts below:
For those who complain about realism sometimes... hey you are watching a movie about Captain America...It starts out with MARVEL comics! Get over it and suspend your disbelief, the method to which we all enjoy stories and tales.",1386115200,,755,4.763358778625954

If you like this genre then you won't be dissapointed as it falls into the Avenger complete storyline, chronologically.",1386028800,,170,5.576923076923077
4697185,5,B005GYJPYW,"Great flick.  Just like the comic book I read in the 60's.  Brought up to this century but still good.  Visual effects were stunning, the acting was great and the story was Dell Comics (DC).

4697186,5,B005GYJPYW,"Aside from the beginning of the movie where it was a little slow, this was a really good movie.  Lots of action and how can anyone not like Captain America, the only mortal superhero. You can't go wrong.  Just make sure if you have any little ones watching that they know wjho/what RedSkull is and what he looks like - my 6 yr old at the time was scared the rest of the movie after seeing him.  Now she knows and at 7 had no problem with it.",1385942400,,441,3.9886363636363638

4697193,4,B005GYJPYW,"the guy who plays the red skull, a Nazi, was the same guy who was Elrond in ""lord of the rings"". it was funny to see him take on such a big switch in roles. but, they both are grumpy roles, I guess.
  there are some other really awesome things going on in this movie like a nearly unstoppable shield, the power of the gods, and disintegrater beam weopons .
  this movie has tie ins to the other movies with avengers in them. unlike the X- men movies which are put together all helter skelter these movies stay true to eachother.
  it would've gotten 5 stars except for 17, coutn em, 17 historical inaccuracies. they are mini skirts, flying cars, women officers in the military, t-shirts with pictures on them, robotic arms, handheld cameras, remote explosives the size of cell phones, one man rocket like submarines, low cut fronts on womens outfits, transponders with no antenna, Asian army soldiers, rotar propelled mimissles, knee length skirts in the military, one of the machine guns, a stealth bomber, mini rockets, and a wireless video camera.
  I really like this movie a lot. it is way better than the old captain America movie from the 80's although it was good too. chris evans totally pulls off a very believable captain America. he is a guy who is what every soldier wants to be, a guy you can believe in and a guy who instills patriotism in us all.",1385510400,,1362,4.530612244897959

4697201,5,B005GYJPYW,"The best of the Marvel films to cover the origin of one of its original heroes, Captain America lives up to its billing as the First Avenger.  I wonder however how they can reconcile Chris Evans having played Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four a few years earlier.  Hugo Weaving delivers an incredible Red Skull who is part Werner Herzog and part Heinrich Himmler.  What is a shame is that we never get to see Bucky Barnes ""suit up"" so to speak as Cap's sidekick, and instead we see them together in the beginning of the film with a 4F Steve Rogers which is a hilarious CGI trick worth watching.  Overall required viewing if you plan to make sense of the Tesseract in The Avengers movie.",1385164800,,683,4.44

4697205,3,B005GYJPYW,"I should note that I only made it 3/4 of the way through.

Reasons why I don't love this:
(1) The plot is too silly.  It is based during WWII, but it isn't historically accurate.  I wish the writers either simply made the story pure fantasy or did a better job making it seem like this is something that possibly happened during WWII.
(2) I'm not a huge fan of Captain America.  The super hero concept seems to be based on the guy  everyone knows who goes to the gym a lot.

It's not horrible I suppose.  I'm sure most kids like it.",1384732800,3,532,4.106796116504855

4697214,5,B005GYJPYW,"The disks and packaging were in great shape and the product was shipped safely.  It is exactly what I ordered and I really enjoy the movie.  It is another exciting chapter in the Marvel comics repertoire and isn't my favorite, but it is still very entertaining.  It is also a good one to watch in 3D.",1384300800,,300,4.321428571428571

4697219,4,B005GYJPYW,"Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss ""God"" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either.",1383955200,,726,4.76984126984127

I've never been a fan of comic book character movies but I did end up like the Marvel story line and now I'm hooked. Keep in mind I've never read any of the comic books so I never know whats going to happen until it comes out on the big screen.

I like Captain America, he comes from a more simple time - back when it was OK to say I love God and my country. I like how he fits in with the Iron Man character. The movie is well acted and has a good plot, I've seen it twice.",1381795200,,587,3.8916666666666666

Id give the movie 5 stars but the plot and story is very so so, which isn't fair, because the comics have great story and I feel doesn't do this movie justice.  Someone on 1 star review said ""what super power does capt have? all he has is a shield he throws"". To that I say, He doesn't have super powers. He is just peak human condition physically and ok mentally.  LIke a real person. The Capt could be anyone of us.  boy , girl ect.  That is his appeal in my opinion.

predictable? - YES!

DUDE! they are making marvel marvel comic book characters  movies,,,,,,, nuff said!

well a bit more..

I grew up reading marvel comics, for the world I was forced to live in marvel was easier to relate to then DC. superman was PERFECT = unreal. marvel characters had flaws and early on had black people in them that said real things. nick fury as a brotha, SO marvel!

the marvel folks can do no wrong in my mind, ( not counting fantastic four- REBOOT PLEASE STAT! )

as for all the rest - more please, I am happy - for all you critics that say the movies are unrealistic - THEY ARE COMIC BOOKS GET A FRICKING GRIP! people are going to see the marvel movies in DROVES! WHY? because marvel stories are awesome.

I was not very excited about Captain America (boring), but found that this was one of my favorite of the Marvel movies (along with the Avengers).  This is also one of his favorites.  So happy to be able to stream it to the computer for him.  Good action, clean fun and not boring.  If you saw Thor and were scared away, don't worry.  The areas that Thor was weak in (love interest, forced humor) are no problem for Cap.",1381190400,,473,4.2

4697277,3,B005GYJPYW,The film is well made. The special effects and cinematography are high quality nothing that would take you out of the fantasy.

I love his funny, witty portrayals he does in other movies, but here he really took the cake.  The cast in this movie is really good as well.  Loved it.

4697291,5,B005GYJPYW,I think this is an excellent family film.  It has something for everyone on the family.  It has action but it is not violent and it moves fast enought to hold the viewer's attention.  The reenactment of a well know comic book character allows adults and children a subject with which  both are familiar.  I greatly enjoyed the film.,1380499200,,332,4.559322033898305

4697298,3,B005GYJPYW,"This is geared to a younger audience.  However, since I had some time to spare I watched it and enjoyed. Most important were the themes that this film carried: a burning desire to serve one's country, and, evil-doers eventually suffer the consequences of their foul deeds.",1380240000,,272,4.913043478260869

4697302,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is in some ways a very old-fashioned movie -- in the best possible sense(s) of the word. Humility, endurance, self-sacrifice, focusing on doing what is right rather than being comfortable, a rejection of image-management in favor of real character. There's even an ongoing discussion on waiting until you find ""the right partner."" The film is extremely violent, as one would expect from a war movie, though not bloody (most bodies vaporize). My main ""beef"": if the scriptwriters had cut even half of the massive list of profanities from Tommy Lee Jones's script, the movie would have been so much better. TLJ is an exceptional actor, but in this movie in particular I really just wanted a magic ""bleep"" button to use almost every time he spoke. All in all, though, this movie has a great heart and left us feeling great despite the sad/hard ending.",1379980800,,864,4.884353741496598

4697304,2,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was intended to be a serious action adventure movie, but I ended up laughing at many of the scenes that were just too ridiculous to be believable.  Probably the funniest scene was when Captain America was sneaking around an enemy compound wearing a bright red white and blue uniform.  If you are not going to dress up in an enemy uniform, you would at least wear camouflage or something that didn't draw attention.  LAUGHABLE!",1379808000,,437,4.723684210526316

watch a good action movie or somebody who's a comic junkie and watch Captain America on screen.

4697351,5,B005GYJPYW,"I always considered Captain America to be, at best, a 2nd level superhero.

However, after seeing this movie and the Avengers, I have to admit I've been proven wrong. This was better than Man of Steel by a whole bunch!

The characters were richly developed. The story, other than the killing of the Red Skull, was very, very good. The reason I mentioned the Red Skull's death is I think the movie makers killing off a big bad guy in any movie slowly boxes in the writers as most super hero's only have a handful of bad guys. IF you definitely kill off their 'adversaries' so easily you've kind of locked in the fact that you're only going to make 3 or 4 movies. Then comes the inevitable reboots which I detest.

Blu-ray picture was exceptional as was the sound. Product arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Price was very good.

I do find it interesting that Marvel movies, on average, are better than movies based on DC characters.

So, it's my hope the movie makers have learned their lession and leave the death of a baddie to be a not 100% sure event.

My wife and I are looking forward to the next Captain America movie in April of 2014.

Highly recommended - I would rate this a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10.",1377993600,,1208,4.342222222222222

4697392,5,B005GYJPYW,"Too many movies have no plot, no ""moral of the story"", nothing to make it memorable.  Captain America breaks out of that mold.

4697412,5,B005GYJPYW,"Cap makes his solo appearance in this fantastic entry into the Avengers percursor film with a sock to Hitler's Jaw. Besides fantastic jobs in casting and performance, the ambiance of the film lends to a more classic tone backed by war propoganda and nods to the wartime fascination with advancement of science and technology. The wizards of the CGI department took Chris Evans from a ripped beefcake, to a 90lb runt, then back to full glory. After ""Flaming On"" as the Human Torch, many doubted his ability to perform a dual role, as it were, into another Superhero costume. In his portrayal, and rightfully so, I feel he played more as Steve Rogers and less as Captain America. He makes you look to the man at the core, the heart behind the shield, and the gentleness under the muscles. In making the classic cut, polite, All American Man stand ahead of the hero he becomes, he portrayed a vision of what we would exemplify as a representation of an ideal America in its values and character.

Hugo Weaving delivers masterfully as the Red Skull, as not an over the top evil doer ala Dr. Doom, but as a depitction of the evil genius promoted from a Nazi Germany representation of what we envioned as the evil of our WW2 enemy. He has the smarts, determination, and ruthlessness to pull off a maniacal menace without making it look like he was trying. Both before and after shucking his fake face, he never had to sell you on the appearance, as that is not what made him devious or powerful.

The environments, vehicles, costumes, and set pieces are a brilliant mix of 40's/50's World of Tomorrow mixed with classical American flair, and a dash of James Bond. The romantic subplot hints just enough to make it a tangible force, and the star supporting cast makes each character memorable and indespensible. Not only is it great to see a hero who unquestionably stands for what is right, it was great to see he did not need to a ""Dark Hero"" or live in a crime ridden metroplis. He lived the motto, ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibilty.""  while wearing the bold colors of the Red, White, and Blue. Uncle Ben would be proud.",1375747200,,2127,4.592105263157895

4697418,5,B005GYJPYW,"I am not a fan of comic books, never read them as a kid.  In fact I don't care for much animation either.  However I do enjoy a good action movie so when a friend told us about the Marvel comic series: Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and the Avengers we decided to someday take a look.  We found ourselves watching Iron Man on regular TV--commercials and all we were so hooked.  We went to Amazon immediately to see what they offered.  We were amazed at how well these movies were done.  Captain America is fantastic and is my favorite too.  I thought it was going to be hokey but it was so well done I wanted to watch it again.  Suspend reality and take a break, watch the Marvel Comics series you'll have a great time.",1375488000,,741,4.242857142857143

4697422,4,B005GYJPYW,"It amazes me what they can do with movies, take a skinny guy and make him into a power house. Lots of unbelievable action and sorta sad for Captain America. He is a likable character that can do some amazing stuff.",1375401600,,214,4.2439024390243905

4697424,4,B005GYJPYW,"Love this because it provides so much background for thor, hulk and ironman. Plus the WWII setting/era is a feel that adds challenges to the techy nature of superhero films. One of my faves.",1375315200,,190,4.617647058823529
4697425,5,B005GYJPYW,I love marvel action comics and the story is not always about the saving of the world or country it is about the man behind the mind,1375315200,,132,3.925925925925926
4697426,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America was crafted in 1941 as a comic book hero drafted to fight in WW II. For nearly all of the character's publication history, Captain America has been the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum, in order to aid the United States government's efforts to win World War II. Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif, and is armed with an indestructible, boomerang-like shield that can both be thrown as a weapon, and defend against others' weapons.

Unlike the comic book, the transformation of Chris Evans into Captain America is complete. He is never Private Rogers after that and this is where the film takes a risk but it pays off. In the film the chemical transformation is very risky and death defying. Evans is convincing. The rest of the ensemble is convincing. The WWII environment is convincing.

I saw it twice in the theaters and purchased the DVD because it will be on my regulars list.  Rotten Tomatoes summarized the reviews in this way: ""With plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment."" Yep.",1375228800,,1231,4.880382775119617
4697427,3,B005GYJPYW,"I wasn't very impressed with this movie whatsoever. Chris Evans is a great Captain America, but the movie in general was slow and very boring.",1375228800,,142,4.72
4697428,4,B005GYJPYW,Great action movie keeps you on the edge of your seat! The lessons taught in this movie remind me very slightly of Marvel's earlier Spiderman flicks teaching good values not just senseless violence for entertainment purposes. With that said I gave it  four stars instead of five because of the small amount of language and violence that is in it though handled appropriately the violence is heavy at times. Overall a good fun movie that I enjoyed very much!,1375228800,,457,4.784810126582278

4697430,4,B005GYJPYW,"I really enjoyed Captain America. I would give it 5 stars, were it not for the unnecessary profanity. captain America is a real breath of fresh air compared to most recent hero stories. any more. The heroes are all portrayed as so broken, so dysfunctional, so self-absorbed, so entirely unimpressive, it is hard to believe they are capable of getting themselves out of bed in the morning, much less saving the day. Captain America on the other hand, is the kind of humble, honest, selfless hero that you can really look up to and say, ""I want to be like him"".",1375142400,,559,4.544554455445544

The DVD was loose in the holder, which concerned me, but when I opened it, I did not see any visible damage.  When I watched the movie, it had a lot of static and froze up several times.  I had to skip some sections to get it to continue playing.  I washed it at one point to see if that might help, but it continued to freeze up.  I don't blame this on the shipper, but I do wonder how the DVD became loose in the sealed case.  I will be returning it but need to get the info on how this is done.",1375056000,,579,3.783333333333333

The first hour (pre-action) was great it was all down hill from there. I never thought I would knock a superhero for being unrealistic but here me out. In a world where all these event could take place, there are some SERIOUS inconsistencies here. I won't spoil the plot for you but it is not well thought out. The story line goes well until the bad fighting begins. The ""bad guys"" always do stupid thing and have horrible aim but these WW2 super soldiers with better technology than we have today are by far the most dysfunctional clowns ever. The good guys have interesting characters though. That is really all that this movie has. The action just made me say ""uuuum what?"".",1373328000,,786,4.503496503496503

The story telling starts out great, gets lost in the middle, then returns by the end.
The middle part could have been done better, but this is not the Classic Captain America, but rather the Ultimates story.
All in all, a very solid movie in the Marvel Universe of films.",1373068800,,389,4.342465753424658

I never expect Marvel movies, or any fun action/adventure based on comics, to be brain food. Instead, I watch strictly to laugh, enjoy the excitement and the art. I have to laugh at some of those silly one star reviews. What, you wanted Kant or Nietzsche? This is for fun!

Anyway, I really got a kick of it. It was fun, had good action, the CGI was beautiful. Hey, I had a good time and that is all that counts, right?",1373068800,2,554,4.08256880733945

4697481,1,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: 2 hours, 04 mins.
Directed by Joe Johnston.
This movie begins after Thor (2011).

  A strange aircraft is found in the Artic. Two men from Washington DC have arrived to take a look at it. It is deep in ice and snow. They cut an opening and inside the craft, they find a metal American shield.
  The story goes back to 1942 when Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving)  invade Norway to steal the Tesseract which is said to have a mysterious blue-light energy source. Schmidt kills and obtains what he wants.
  A skinny 90-pound Steve Rogers was not accepted into the Army for military duty because of his small frame and asthma. He was given a ""4F"".  He meets James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan). He takes him on a double date to the Exhibition. James is with Connie (Jenna-Louise Coleman). Steve tries to enlist in the Army again. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) overhears him and helps Steve get enlisted.
 In training camp, Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) just doesn't like Steve because he is not big like the other men.
 Dr. Erskine gives Steve micro-injections into his muscle groups. He comes out of the tank muscular and taller. Suddenly, Schmidt's men come in and kill Dr. Erskine.
  Colonel Chester Phillips doesn't want Steve to go after Schmidt.
 Senator Brandt (Michael Brandon) gives Steve a promotion.  He turns him into an Army mascot dressed as a super hero, Captain America for posters, short films and tour shows.
  With a shield and developing more strength, he goes to Hamburg, Germany to find his friend Sgt. James ""Bucky"" Barnes and to go after Johann Schmidt who has revealed himself to be the Red Skull.

Also in the cast: Hayley Atwell, Dominic Cooper, Richard Armitage, Toby Jones, Bruno Ricci, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, Stan Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Anatole Taubman, Amanda Righetti.

4697482,3,B005GYJPYW,"Frankly, I was expecting more.

This movie suffers from the humdrum of over-familiarity.  There are no surprises, not even when Hugo Weaving rips off his face.  Chris Evans has the look but lacks charisma.  Tommy Lee Jones is uncharacteristically nasty and also a bit of a clich.  Many scenes felt like rip-offs of other films (why did this movie begin like The Thing?).  How many times has a movie character been caught kissing the wrong girl (and have it not amount to anything)?  Seriously, riding on the top of a speeding taxi, that's never been done before!  The BLUE LIGHT special wasn't.  It's nice to know a movie can be futuristic and a period piece at the same time and not defy logic or reality.
They wasted so much time prepping this movie as a means of introducing the character, destined for other films, that they left out the most intriguing part of his story, the comeback.  He went from one time period (they devoted a full two hours to it), to another time period in the blink of an eye (we even get to see the blink as a long blackout).  That's it.  The end.  Stay tuned.  To be continued.  I'm surprised they didn't use ""never mind"" as their postscript.

For me, this was a huge letdown.  Their only attribute, Stanley Tucci, was wasted in a small role.  Oh, well, yes, the shield was cool.  That's about it.
I'm keeping it only until I decide whether I'll be saving the rest of the of Marvel super heroes series (Iron Man, Lead Bottom, The Heil Hydra Antics, Thorn, The Avengers.........not the better one featuring Mrs. Peel).

I console myself with the thought that it could have been a lot worse.",1372636800,,1621,4.524137931034483
4697483,5,B005GYJPYW,"A good bit of this film is a superhero-origins story, in which we follow Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a plain-featured young man of about 20 years old who is a classic ""90-pound weakling,"" as he tries five times to enlist in the Army during the early part of World War II.",1372636800,,271,4.333333333333333
4697484,5,B005GYJPYW,I liked the story being set during WW2.  I hope the sequel resolves what happens to Captain's love interest.  This is director Joe Johnston's best movie by far.,1372636800,,160,4.678571428571429
4697485,5,B005GYJPYW,"I'm a fan of Captain America comics way from the ""Silver Age ' when Kirby drew him , an again 40 yrs later when Brubaker created some of the best revamps in comic history . This movie was great , Joe Johnson knows how to create ""comic book movies such as THE Phantom "". Chris Evans does a fantastic job as Steve Rogers ,and how He becomes Captain America an fights the Red Skull and Hydra . The movie clocks in just under 2 hours an moves though quite quickly . Though they show 'The Howlers"" , such as Dum-Dum and Gabe , they are just soldiers in this movie . I liked the costome they chose for Captain America , its just like the Brubaker comics in WW2. The helmet with a loose fitting outfit . I liked this a lot better than the one He wore in The Avengers . This is the better made super hero movies made so far . I cant wait for Captain America : Winter Soldier , when Bucky returns brain washed by the Russians as  a killer  along with The Falcon and Crossbones an perhaps the Red Skulls daughter Sin .

4697489,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger could not have possibly been more pro-American--in the best sense of the term. More than just being set during World War II, the film captures the same patriotic spirit of war movies that were actually made then. And it could not possibly show greater respect for the character whose story it tells. In some ways, it seemed less like a superhero movie than a History Channel bio pic or Ken Burns documentary about one of our nation's greatest champions of freedom.

The primary source of the good will this movie generates for the U.S.A. is actor Chris Evans' portrayal of Steve Rogers, the man behind the mask of Captain America. Evans' performance had the exact combination of earnestness, determination, humility, guilelessness and unfaltering commitment to serving the greater good that I consider the defining traits of the character. It's these attributes, and not the superheroic persona and outfit he eventually adopts, that make him a perfect embodiment of how Americans, and the rest of the world, once saw this country.  As Evans said in an interview, ""The movie is about values, morals, and someone standing up for the right thing. It's about someone fighting for justice who puts himself last and compassion first."" Once Steve Rogers is transformed from 98-lb. weakling to super-soldier by Dr. Abraham Erskine (wonderfully played by Stanley Tucci), as Captain America he uses his military might less like the world's policeman than its big brother, coming to the rescue when other nations are getting pushed around by Bully States. And like a good neighbor, he never butts in where he isn't invited or overstays his welcome.

As I see it, Captain America: The First Avenger is nothing short of a nostalgic love letter to our country: not so much the way it is, or even the way it was, as much as the way we've always wanted it to be. It celebrates everything good about America--from its desire to spread democracy to its scientific innovation--but ignores everything bad, like the racial segregation of the military or internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II (even though it includes African-American Gabe Jones (Derek Luke) and Japanese-American Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi) among the Howling Commandos who join Captain America in his wartime escapades). But given the nature of this film, I don't fault it for praising America's achievements so highly, or for ignoring our misdeeds during WWII. Ironically (and unexpectedly), my only major criticism of the movie is that it ignores the misdeeds of our enemy.

Captain America is defined as much by what he stands against as what he stands for. Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created him more than 70 years ago in response to the specific circumstances of their times. There's a reason they chose Adolf Hitler to be on the receiving end of their character's first blow for democracy on the 1941 cover of Captain America #1 (I was thrilled to see this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iconic-cover/dp/B00B9JCFKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iconic cover</a>&nbsp;cleverly incorporated into the movie). The Third Reich and Nazi Party carried out evils unlike any the world had ever seen. As Jews, Simon and Kirby would have a very personal stake in showing Captain America symbolically destroy Hitler's forces in the pages of a comic book that at its height was selling a million copies a month. It would be inconceivable to make a movie about Captain America's earliest adventures, or any movie about World War II for that matter, without the Nazi's playing a prominent part. And yet, director Joe Johnston pulled it off--for reasons I can't begin to understand.

The evil empire Johnston pits Captain America against is Hydra, a fictional terrorist network in the Marvel Comics universe. This is no doubt to set the organization up as a recurring adversary in future Marvel Studios films.  Here it's described as a Nazi research group that combined occult powers and advanced technology to create wonder weapons for Hitler's stormtroopers. What I found disturbing was that the Nazi part of the organization was downplayed to the point of virtual invisibility. Although Hydra's tentacled skull symbol got about as much screen time as the stars and stripes, I don't recall ever seeing a swastika (although I'm sure the few that must have appeared in the movie just went by so fast I missed them*). I might understand, at least theoretically, choosing to minimize references to Germany out of a sensitivity to present-day Germans (although, as Dr. Erskine points out in the film, ""the first country the Nazi's invaded was their own""). But whose feelings could the filmmakers have been trying to spare by taking Nazis out of the picture? Even more incredible than the lack of swastikas in the movie, was the total absence of any mention of the Holocaust (as far as I can remember, it wasn't even hinted at). Besides being a seemingly misguided attempt to sanitize history, it also diminishes the importance of Captain America's conflict with the film's main villain.

Hydra's leader is the Red Skull (played menacingly by Hugo Weaving), a character who debuted in the same 1941 comic book as Captain America and has been the arch nemesis of the ""Sentinel of Liberty"" ever since. The Red Skull is the living embodiment of everything Hitler and Nazi Germany stood for--Aryan superiority, racism, antisemitism, homophobia and blind obedience to the State to name a few. The Third Reich personified, he excels at and revels in the practical application of Nazi theory--unprovoked military aggression, torture, political repression and mass murder. But in the movie, the Red Skull abandons Nazism for a more vague, generic super villain desire to rule the world. The problem I have with this is that he never explains why this is his goal, or how a world under his control would differ from the one he's already living in. To put it in actor terms, I don't understand his motivation. It's clear that he is cruel and arrogant, which makes him Steve Roger's opposite in terms of his basic character. But in comic books, the Red Skull was created to be Captain America's opposite.

Based on their depiction of Steve Rogers' pre-Captain America training, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were obviously influenced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Captain-America-Sentinel-of-Liberty/dp/0871358115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty</a>,  a 1991 four-part miniseries by storytellers Fabian Nicieza and Kevin Maguire, retelling Cap's origin in commemoration of the character's 50th anniversary. Unfortunately, I get the impression Markus and McFeely never read the last book in the series, where a captured Captain America is taken to the heart of Nazi Germany and forced into an arena to battle the Red Skull in ritual combat before Adolf Hitler and an audience of Wehrmacht soldiers, Gestapo officers, and concentration camp prisoners (who were so conspicuously absent from the film). Of course, this intended demonstration of Aryan superiority does not turn out as Hitler had hoped. Now that's something I would have loved to have seen on the big screen.

By removing any trace of Nazi philosophy from the Red Skull in this film, his final battle with Captain America becomes nothing more than two comic book characters slugging it out. Instead, it should have been an allegorical clash of ideologies: totalitarianism, intolerance and brutality versus freedom, acceptance and compassion. This is not just a war over territory but an epic war of wills that has been waged since the dawn of civilization--the Will to Power versus the Will of the People. For me, the failure to make clear the moral high ground in this fight kept a merely good movie from being truly great.

If you watched Avengers before watching this, then Cpt America is a better prequel than Thor or the Iron Man series.  The ending was a little wierd and wished that the author's thought it out more.  It seems like towards the end they were struggling to fit as much of the movie into as little time possible.

The only thing I didn't like was when they did too much with CGI, in particular the scene with a hanger/runway in a mountain at the end. It was absurdly long for the sole purpose of doing the action. There's creative fantasy and then there's just stupid. That's in contrast to all the other set design which was amazing.",1372118400,,494,4.428571428571429

4697501,4,B005GYJPYW,"Pretty damn hard I guess. As my foggy memory recalls, they had tried it twice before with less than satisfactory results, and they did that to my favorite Marvel character?? So when I heard another Captain America movie was in the works I was a little dubious, not as much as I would have been 14 years ago though. Since then Marvel has upped their game and really put out well done movie versions of their super hero's. When I heard who they picked to play Cap, I wasn't exactly thrilled because I connected him with his previous Marvel character - the ""Human Torch"".

Nonetheless my wife I and I went to see it at the theatre and it was great, finally Captain America had been done right by the movies, and he was even better in the Avengers movie.

4697541,5,B005GYJPYW,"My husband and I both enjoyed this film. It was prefect for our mid-week date night. I highly recommend the film for older children (10+) due to the violence. The villain would likely frighten younger children. Lots of fast-paced chase scenes and humorous dialogue kept us smiling through most of the movie. It was wonderfully refreshing to savor the battle scenes, and the classic pairing of good versus bad guys fight scenes without ANY obscenities! Though the digital effects are obvious, the familiar storyline, solid casting, and clever allusions to action classics (Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc) made for a solid movie.

4697577,5,B005GYJPYW,"""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Steve Rogers volunteers to participate in an experimental program that turns him into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. As Captain America, Rogers joins forces with Bucky Barnes and Peggy Carter to wage war on the evil HYDRA organization, led by the villainous Red Skull.

The cast led by Chris Evans (as Steve Rogers / Captain America) is excellent. The directing by Joe Johnston (also executive produced) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the comic books by Jack Kirby & Joe Simon) by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely is excellent.

The music by Alan Silvestri is excellent. The cinematography by Shelly Johnson is excellent. The film editing by Jeffrey Ford & Robert Dalva is excellent. The casting by Sarah Finn, Randi Hiller & Priscilla John is excellent. The production design by Rick Heinrichs is excellent. The art direction by Dean Clegg, John Dexter, Phil Harvey, Paul Kirby, Jason Knox-Johnston, Chris Lowe, Andy Nicholson & Phil Sims is excellent. The set decoration by John Bush is excellent. The costume design by Anna B. Sheppard is excellent. The visual & make-up effects are excellent, as well, as the stunt work.

This is another excellent comic-book adaptation (from Marvel Studios & Marvel Comics) that is well-made and entertaining. It is also fun and well-paced. Chris Evans is excellent as Steve Rogers / Captain America. This is one of the best movies of the summer and of the year, as well, so far.",1369526400,,1521,5.003952569169961

4697591,5,B005GYJPYW,Great Movie I Liked it but I felt you left me hanging there I wanted to see more ... Make a Sequel with Chris Evans in it !!!!!,1369008000,,127,3.5714285714285716
4697592,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is the best non-comedy film of summer 2011. Read: here we have the first and only strong action-laden comic book adaptation of this season, a minor godsend in the midst of heinous sequels, lame comic adaptations, and overblown action epics.

I'm not one for jingoistic, rah-rah, ""My Country Right or Wrong"" type of American sentiment, so the mere notion of a dude running around in a red, white, and blue get-up slaying bad guys in the name of patriotism is not, on its face, my cup of tea. Add to that my admission that I was not, strictly speaking, an avid comic book reader growing up, and this movie might seem to be rejected just on the basis of my DNA makeup. But damn it, it works - exceedingly well, from the opening frames to the closing credits, which are more creative than the entirety of 2011's other comic-inspired offerings.

The film places its emphasis on story and character rather than just roughly recreating the comic lore. And it is, in fact, a bit of a satire on jingoism, playfully mocking the propaganda of the WWII era. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who earlier penned the Chronicles of Narnia films to decidedly less success) and directed by Joe Johnston, arguably the most imaginative film director to tackle a comic book film to date, The First Avenger works on every level. It works as an origin story, an action film, a faithful adaptation of the source material, and a story about a scrawny kid with a big heart who is given an opportunity to make his transform his body into the physical representation of his inner strength, and uses it to carry out justice against a bad-ass super-villain.

Chris Evans has long been a safely charming presence in a variety of middling comedies and action pictures, but he finds a way into Steve Rogers, the short-and-skinny kid who soon becomes a genetically-engineered super soldier, that affords him a humanity he has never reached as an actor. Steve/Cap's romantic foil, Peggy Carter, is played by British import Hayley Atwell (The Duchess), who arrives out of virtual anonymity to announce herself as the next great charismatic lead actress. The screenplay wisely allows Peggy more room to contribute to the story rather than just filling her role as ""The Girl,"" and her relationship with the titular hero is engaging without ever becoming cloying or playing out to presumed expectations. Also aiding our newly-minted hero is Colonel Chester Phillips, played by Tommy Lee Jones as only he can - with that patented form of grizzled, no-nonsense, wise-cracking charm. And Hugo Weaving, already one of the great portrayers of epic Hollywood villains, crafts another big one as rogue Nazi agent Johann Schmidt, who transforms into Red Skull, the evil Yin to Cap's heroic Yang.

Form and style are prominent elements in the film; its sepia-tinged imagery has been a point of discussion ever since the first teaser trailer debuted during the Super Bowl. The play on classic antiquity could easily come off as a trite gag, but Johnston - aided by cinematographer Shelly Johnson - has such a command of this world that the visual element washes over us, drawing us completely into not merely a particular time and place, but to a state of psychic nostalgia. The film takes its time to get to the major action set pieces, but once they arrive, the excitement fuses with the nostalgia to create one of the great comic-to-screen transitions we've ever seen.

Few films are perfect, and as fun as Captain America: The First Avenger is, there is one gaping hole near film's end that can only be discussed after a clearly marked SPOILER WARNING. Baked right into the title is that ""avenger"" word, carefully placed to telegraph the film's ultimate conclusion, which in all fairness is clever and engaging and true to the gradual path of the comics. Problem is, it is only there to act as a dynamite lead-in for next year's superhero extravaganza, The Avengers. The necessity for immediate cross-breeding among Marvel entities brings the story to an odd halt, one that basically threatens the future of this franchise continuing with this same group of engaging characters - at least without some serious comic book massaging of details and timelines, a massage Marvel Studios is likely more than willing to perform. (End spoilers.)

Frustrating ending aside, the film is an absolute blast. Captain America: The First Avenger, against all odds, will endure with Iron Man and Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films as one of the best Marvel adaptations ever.",1369008000,,4570,4.9055627425614485

4697594,3,B005GYJPYW,"This movie has an 'Indiana Jones' feel to it in a far removed sort of way.  Don't misunderstand, it's no  'Indiana Jones' - not by a long shot, but it does have an interesting take on the back story to Captain America.

This movie may be a second-cousin-twice-removed to 'Watchmen'...",1368921600,,284,4.64
4697595,4,B005GYJPYW,"As far as superhero movies go, this is a good one. The story is not as cliche as most which is good, but there are too many slow parts to the movie given its genre. Essentially 90% of the action is packed into the final 30 minutes.

That being said, it is still a really good movie and the visuals are really good, not much of a surprise for anything produced in the past fifteen years. It is just not as good of a movie as, say, the first Ironman, in my opinion.",1368921600,,463,3.978494623655914
4697596,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie is an American as Apple Pie.  Chris Evans does a wonderful job from beginning to end with his honesty and strength from inside himself of wanting to fight for his country.

Movie takes place during 1941 WWII, seeing Chris Evans as a scrony young man until he meets up with Dr. Erskine [Stanley Tucci] letting him know he can make a difference and help contribute to the worldwide struggle against the Nazis.
So with Dr. Erskine and Peggy at Steve's side he turns into our all American Superhero 'Captain America'.

This is a wonderful movie for all ages, I love the innuendo's throughout the movie, the scenery and the continued comic book style from the thoughts of Stan Lee.  I especially love the ending as it brings a new curve to the next movie. Great ending.",1368921600,,775,4.594202898550725

Fortunately, The Avengers was a great movie so the set up was worth it.  On its own, it's an ok movie.  With The Avengers, it adds a lot of depth to the character and really fleshes out the whole experience.

Watch this movie.  Then watch The Avengers.  You won't be disappointed.",1368489600,,411,4.342105263157895

4697623,5,B005GYJPYW,"I purchased Ghost Rider, Captain America, The Avengers,& The Hobbit in the last 30 days. The Hobbit has the best 3-D and was a bargain compared to the others. Ghost Rider came in second and Captain America was third. Good 3-D brings you into the fantasy which means things should be in focus as if you are there. The Hobbit was just superior in every respect and the flaws in Ghost Rider could be overlooked because of the action. In the case of Captain America which is a period piece of WW2 the flaws could be lost in the glare and shadows of Art Deco lighting, dust of war , miserable weather conditions etc.. I should have just purchased the DVD of The Avengers because even on the standard Blu Ray let alone in the 3-D, focus and double image was just bad so less clarity / sharpness was a blessing. My system is high end Panasonic with a 60 inch screen. I only mention this because I know lesser systems could be blamed for my opinion and 3-D technology is not quite there yet so selection is also sparse .",1368316800,,1012,4.303664921465969

Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies. It's a little light on ""Cap"" action, but origins usually are. The story is pretty easy to follow and the  Red Skull the perfect choice for the villain. Excellent FX  and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans. Also sets up The Avenger's film with Thor, Iron Man and The Hulk films.

Resolve and old fashioned American values are something kids should take away from this movie. Honor, courage and perseverance are virtues severely lacking in today's society. Captain America has it all.",1366848000,,357,4.868852459016393

4697665,4,B005GYJPYW,"Good Story line, not done as well as the comic book for us nastalgic baby boomers but with the computer graphics and cinematography it was better than I expected.  After seeing it at the theater I bought it for my DVD collection",1366675200,,228,4.428571428571429
4697666,5,B005GYJPYW,Great movie and a must to watch be you watch the Advenger movie. I would recomend this movie to a friend.,1366675200,,105,4.0476190476190474

4697670,4,B005GYJPYW,"I liked this movie a lot and will watch it again. It's fast paced with lots of action, has a great story line and it was quite enjoyable. The ending left plenty of room for a sequel so I'll be looking for that one of these days.",1366502400,,228,3.872340425531915
4697671,4,B005GYJPYW,"I was hopeful that this movie would be good, as Joe Johnston did really awesome with the period movie Rocketeer & Chris Evans may finally show that he is more than the goof ball, he can actually act, as seen in Sunshine and even Push. My hope was well founded & exceeded, as it was everything I could have wanted and more. It just worked, and Chris Evans was Steve Rogers, Captain America. The Story was fantastic & enjoyable, as was the action. Aside from Evans, the rest of the cast were perfect, especially Tommy Lee Jones & Hugo Weaving, as well as Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. My only real nit picky complaint was that the movie could have had more Howling Commandos in it, or at least let is in on their names during the movie, maybe next time. From the story & look to the acting & action plus it's connections to the Marvel Cinematic Universe & The Avengers, I can't recommend this movie enough.",1366502400,,906,4.398809523809524

I like the Avengers and the Transformers more than the X-Men (tho they are okay). Not knowing much about Captain America (I was mostly a Hulk fan from way back when (before the Bixby TV series even)), it was neat to see this movie and learn more about him. I like the part he plays in the new Avengers movie also. Still, he hasn't replaced the irreverent Iron Man on my like more list.",1366156800,,519,4.148514851485149

4697686,5,B005GYJPYW,"No worries about some naked body popping up for nothing in this one.  Great for older children (I'd say maybe 10+), has action and stuff blowing up, and I think I remember a bit of colorful language...but forgive me for being old-fashioned, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE when the character (Captain America) stays true to his time/upbringing/values!!",1366156800,,338,5.1454545454545455

4697689,5,B005GYJPYW,"Blu-ray is amazing as always. Video is crisp and clear, surround sound is loud and booming. Digital copy (thankfully not a Flixter/UltraViolet copy) was easy to download and transfer around.

Movie itself is a rather well done. I consider myself a fanboy and I tend to pick apart all comic book made movies but this one is hard to do. They did take some artistic-librities here and there, but overall the purpose was well served and amazingly done. I particularly liked how they setup all the storyline necessary to do any number of sequels. The Peggy/Sharron Carter story lines, The Bucky/Winter Soldier story lines, the Cosmic Cube (aka the Tesseract) story line, etc etc. Overall, I really did enjoy the movie.",1365984000,,713,4.892561983471074

4697698,5,B005GYJPYW,Loved the movie!  Good family fun!  I love the separate movies and then putting them all together in the Avengers movie.  Must see for family movie night.  Worst part for small children is the people being shot and turning to dust.,1365724800,,231,4.560975609756097
4697699,5,B005GYJPYW,awesome service-received on time and product description was as received. enjoyed the product very much and cover was packaged properly.,1365638400,,136,5.85
4697700,5,B005GYJPYW,"I was told to watch this ""Avenger"" movie first, but I believe it should be watched right before ""The Avenger's"" movie.
Captain America was the first Avenger, but he was on ice for a few decades while the other Avenger's were being realized. He was from a very different time and place. His story is being told from present day looking back.
I know all of the special effects are not perfect, but these professionals are taking stories from the pages of comic books and putting them on he BIG screen. When reading any kind of book, you need a lot of imagination, so I think we should consider that when watching and rating a movie. (some needing more imagination than others, especially with body transformation)
I think ""Captain America"" is a good all around hero story and like many other young American's he was a hero before he was an ""Avenger"".
I loved it and I know that I could not do any better for entertainment!",1365638400,,920,4.514970059880239

4697702,5,B005GYJPYW,One of my favorites. Great movie. This was a well made movie for this new generation. Looking forward to part 2.,1365465600,,112,4.380952380952381
4697703,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is the Superman of the Marvel universe. He is the ultimate good man, who does what he does for others more than himself. He is humbled and selfless and these are the reasons we love him. The idea of bringing a character set in a time that we have yet to see a superhero in, was risky and well worth it. The casting is phenomenal. Chris Evans absolutely shines as the lead, a role he plays brilliantly. He's understated and humble. He seems like a real man, someone we could see ourselves in. Stanley Tucci is fantastic. There is no other way for Stanley Tucci to be. Hugo Weaving again plays the bad guy, and we realized why he does. He plays creepy and terrifying better than anyone. Other roles include Tommy Lee Jones as the non believing skeptic, which he plays flawlessly, Hayley Atwell brings female strength and gusto as Peggy Carter, Dominic Cooper captures a very Robert Downey Jr. esque cocky sarcasm, which is fantastic as he is playing his father, Sebastian Stan is wonderful as Caps loyal sidekick Bucky, and an almost unrecognizable Richard Armitage plays the German agent assigned to disrupt the Rogers experiment. All roles are played gorgeously. The settings are beautiful, the effects stunning, the story is as good as it could have been. It does drag at times, but we'll worth the watch. Captain America is one of the world's most beloved heroes. This will show you why.",1365465600,,1405,4.6923076923076925
4697704,4,B005GYJPYW,"What makes Captain America great is that he's humble, patriotic, and tough-as-nails. What's not to love? This movie reminded me of the classic Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. Can't wait for sequels.",1365465600,,206,5.46875
4697705,5,B005GYJPYW,I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a good story line from how Captain America came to being in fighting the enemy during WWII to the present day. I can't wait for the next Captain America movie to come out to see how he adjusts to the modern day.,1365465600,,291,4.196428571428571

4697719,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie is part of the Avenger series of stories. I love that the writers are tying all the Marvel characters together in multiple films. If you enjoyed the Ironman movies, you should enjoy this somewhat of a prequel of the Avengers.",1364947200,,236,4.642857142857143

4697721,5,B005GYJPYW,We love the super hero movies and this one did not disappoint.  Choosing the candidate to be Captain American because he was a good person not just a good soldier helps to reinforce that we all need to be good Americans is fantastic.,1364947200,,233,4.4186046511627906

4697725,5,B005GYJPYW,"I had seen quite a few clips and trailers for Captain America, but didn't get around to watching it until after seeing Avengers.  This is how movies used to be. There is an unapologetic tone of Allied good guys (who are just common folk) versus Nazi bad guys (who have unlimited technology and weapons). Analyze the psychology, if you like, but it's more fun to sit back and enjoy the heroics.

One flaw, sort of, is that the Cap' puts together a comando team, and it lacks a certain Canadian with retractable claws...",1364774400,,518,4.559139784946237

4697731,4,B005GYJPYW,"There are a couple of slow moments, but not that many! For today's action-type film, Captain America is actually a pretty good one. It's also refreshing to see a movie with a little bit of un-apologized-for patriotism! (Do we really have to go back to a WW2 film to find a bold statement of loving one's country? Now that's sad!)  Regardless, this is a noble film for an action movie. The acting is good, the effects above average, the message is welcome!  I also find it refreshing to view a film that doesn't rely on expletives to fill half the movie's dialog. (Thank you, filmmaker!)

The production values are excellent, the cast is as appealing or terrifying as required. Along with Chris Evans who is the heart of the film, the original 90 pound weakling who turns into CAPTAIN AMERICA, there are Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci  for support. CAPTAIN AMERICA:The First Avenger is far better and more focused than the follow up film THE AVENGERS. I recommend it.",1364169600,,495,4.625
4697744,4,B005GYJPYW,"Watching this movie helped make the Avengers make more sense. It was a fun action movie that I could watch with grand kids. I appreciate a movie with action but not gore, no terrible language and no explicit sex.",1364169600,,212,4.461538461538462
4697745,5,B005GYJPYW,"I enjoy movies where the hero espouses some real values of God, duty, and patriotism.  I don't have to worry about sexual situations or foul language.  I wish there were more more movies like this.",1364169600,,197,4.6
4697746,2,B005GYJPYW,I was not at all impressed by this movie.  It felt very cheesy and frankly boring.  Not even close to the quality that Avengers had.,1364083200,,132,4.24
4697747,5,B005GYJPYW,I really enjoyed the way the whole Captain America story is told and the enteraction between the Captain and the Red Skull.  Great movie.,1363996800,,137,4.708333333333333
4697748,4,B005GYJPYW,"This was a good movie but it was obvious that the intent was to set the tone for the coming of ""Avengers"" & not to give the Captain America character a venue to expand. It's quite unfortunate that this is all the adventures we'll ever see that centers around the character. The Captain America graphic series was so full of great stories that they easily could have done more. I guess the modern day producers & directors can't figure out how to make something exciting unless it involves machines, monsters or super-natural beings. All-in-all, I really liked the film. So much so that it left me wanting to see more of the Captain on the screen.",1363910400,,646,4.577586206896552
4697749,5,B005GYJPYW,"Good story, good movie.
WIsh there were more Captain America movies.

4697752,5,B005GYJPYW,This was a great movie.  Really cannot wait to see Captain America Winter Solider in 2014.  This is one of Marvel's best comics.,1363824000,,128,4.521739130434782
4697753,5,B005GYJPYW,I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day and even though the movie was open the disc was scratch free.,1363737600,,107,4.142857142857143
4697754,2,B005GYJPYW,No story  action was contrived.  No personality in the Captain America character.  I wouldn't waste my time with this movie.,1363737600,2,124,5.1
4697755,3,B005GYJPYW,"So the movie itself was ""just ok"". A little slow. I watched this because I LOVED ""The Avengers"" but yet I could tell while watching that movie that they really had expected that you watched all of the other prelude movies leading up to it like ""Iron Man"", ""Captain America"", ""Thor"", etc. So thinking those movies would be as good as the Avengers I grabbed them. I had already seen ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"" which is what got me interested in the Avengers to begin with (which were both GREAT films) but hadn't seen the others.

Captain America was ""ok"" but does give you a little better background going into the Avengers.

The packaging for this was great, the extra content was ok, and having the digital edition was important to me.",1363737600,,737,4.492537313432836
4697756,4,B005GYJPYW,"This is an amazing and fantastic movie and I wish I could have given this 5 stars but the audio was very poor. The acting, storyline and plot were great and deserve 5 stars but the audio quality was poor and I had a hard time hearing the actors speaking.",1363737600,,254,4.1

4697759,4,B005GYJPYW,"Would I want to see it again soon, I think not.  But, it was a real slam banger with a somewhat believable plot.  The hero wins and the villains loose.  What's not to like?",1363564800,,172,4.0
4697760,5,B005GYJPYW,Much better that I anticipated.  I will probably watch it again in a few months. Good action. Not cheesy like some comic-based movies. And the ending where he .... Psych!,1363392000,,170,4.666666666666667

4697765,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was like the ones I grew up with.  Lots of action, with the hero front and center, and the female scientest falling for him.

Brings back memories of Buck Rogers, the old Superman and of course our Cowboy heroes.

If you want a movie without the blood and gore.  If you want to be entertained and just to sit back and enjoy, this is the movie for you.",1363305600,,362,4.128571428571429

4697769,4,B005GYJPYW,"I enjoyed Cpt America immensely, but thought the technology displayed for WW-II era times was way over the top - requires a major suspension of belief to digest. Well, you have to do that to believe that 2 minutes in a capsule can change a man's physiology and physic so drastically. So there you go. Suspend beliefs and enjoy the fantasy. Very adventure-packed. Nice romantic hints. Funny to some extent. Leads up nicely to The Avengers which I rated 5 stars.",1363219200,,460,4.691358024691358

4697771,4,B005GYJPYW,"Of all the Marvel superhero comics I was into as a kid, I thought Captain America would be the most difficult to translate into a movie for today.  A guy who dresses like the American flag?  How could that not be unbearably corny?  But these guys have pulled it off.  The device they came up with to explain the star-spangled ""Captain America"" character was, to my mind, ingenious.  I won't spoil it for you by describing it here.  Let's just say that they took on a very challenging task and succeeded.  Yes, it's a comic-book movie, but it's a well-done comic-book movie and that's what it's supposed to be.  The writing, direction, and cast were all first-rate.",1363046400,,664,4.615384615384615
4697772,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is a fun, entertaining film. Good adventure and very good special effects.  Pretty good story line but fairly predictable.  I recommend this movie if you just want to be entertained for 90 or so minutes.",1363046400,,219,4.891891891891892
4697773,4,B005GYJPYW,"Wanted To watch the first Avenger before I rented the second one. I enjoyed the actors, plot, and special effects of this movie.  Can't go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones.",1363046400,,166,4.533333333333333

4697775,2,B005GYJPYW,"Good story, bad acting.  I mean absolutely terrible acting, worst of all the ""Avengers"" series of movies.  Probably should watch it if you want to know some backstory for The Avengers, but that's the only reason.",1363046400,,212,4.861111111111111
4697776,3,B005GYJPYW,"Generic action scenes and acting,  so-so story,  Indiana Jones Nazi story ripoff, not vested in character or ending.  Seems geared to teenagers.",1363046400,,144,5.454545454545454
4697777,5,B005GYJPYW,"I've always been a huge fan of Marvel movies and this was the start of it. When I saw this movie I absolutely fell in love with Chris Evans (Captain America). He is absolutely phenomenal in this film, along with all the rest of the actors. The directors did a amazing job capturing the story and making it feel like it actually happened in the 40's. I'd like to say this also made me love the 40's era. From the beginning of the movie, you already have foreshadowing to finding Captain America in the ice. There is also foreshadowing to the other Marvel movies, Iron Man and Avengers. Steve Rogers ends up befriending Tony Stark's father, Howard Stark. Howard is actually the one to create Steve's super strength.
  Not only is this movie jam packed with action and suspense, but it's got a good amount of humor and romance as well. I wasn't aware when I first started watching that Steve Rogers would gain a love interest. Although when Peggy Carter came in I loved her character immediately. In most movies, all sergeants are men. I love that this had her as a tough girl. She wasn't afraid of punching a man and showing them she's not a helpless women. Even when Steve saved her from getting hit by a car, she wasn't afraid. That's another thing, Steve Rogers is extremely respectful and caring. I love that about him. He, too isn't afraid of a lot. He was weak and still wanted to stand up for his country to get rid of the ""bullies"" as he would say.
  I've seen this movie many times, and each time I watch it, I'm amazed by the cinematography. It's absolutely gorgeous. From the sky scenes to the way the camera moves around the actors. The same goes to the orchestra soundtrack. The soundtrack really gives me chills, especially in the end.
  I would definitely recommend buying this movie. It's ones of those movies you could sit on your couch with a nice bowl of popcorn and cry over how stunning it is. Not to mention Chris Evans is pretty attractive.",1363046400,,1961,4.4789915966386555

4697779,5,B005GYJPYW,I didn't see this in the theater & I really enjoyed watching it on Amazon.  Thank you for having free movies available to Prime members.,1363046400,,136,4.44
4697780,5,B005GYJPYW,I loved this movie! It was all I could have asked for in a Captain America movie; especially with Chris Evans!,1363046400,,110,4.285714285714286
4697781,5,B005GYJPYW,"What's not to like?  A handsome guy that embodies the values of what we know is truly the American spirit!!  Great background movie for the Avengers tie in.  We were  hoping for a sequel (to Thor as well), but it doesn't seem likely.  Too bad - because the characters are really wonderful.",1362960000,,289,4.480769230769231
4697782,4,B005GYJPYW,"Lots of good action and humor considering that it is the origin story. Not the best Marvel movie out there. Perhaps, not even close. But it was necessary as a precursor to the Avengers movie.",1362873600,,191,4.485714285714286
4697783,4,B005GYJPYW,Better than I thought it would be. Liked how we found out the origin of Captain America. Loved Stan Lee's cameo appearance.,1362873600,,123,4.636363636363637

4697785,5,B005GYJPYW,"Chris Evans does a terrific job as scrappy, honorable & intelligent Steve Rogers. Tommy Lee Jones as a crusty skeptical general and  Stanley Tucci as the doctor who gives Rogers superpowers do a terrific job in supporting roles. Hugo Weaving plays the Red Skull as Rogers' nemesis. The story and action sequences are well done. I would recommend this movie to everyone.",1362787200,,369,4.951612903225806

4697792,4,B005GYJPYW,"The interesting thing here is how, in a world of Superheroes, do you make the ""normal"" guy interesting.  The movie handles the topic well and serves as a could lead in to the Avengers ensemble movie released after this one.",1362614400,2,223,4.575
4697793,2,B005GYJPYW,This was the worst movie of the Avengers spin-offs.  Not a whole lot of action and the main character is not very likable.,1362528000,,122,4.304347826086956
4697794,2,B005GYJPYW,It started slow and I keep waiting for it to take off and it never did.  Very slow movie and calling this an action adventure is inaccurate.  Basically no action nor adventure.,1362528000,,176,4.46875

4697796,4,B005GYJPYW,"I think having Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III) was the inspired choice here, as he captures the 1940s vibe so well. Evans is surprisingly good as Cap, while the supporting actors (Hayley Atwell, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper, Stanley Tucci) are superb. Almost gave it 5-stars, but the finale feels a little too rushed.",1362528000,,359,5.101694915254237

4697802,5,B005GYJPYW,"Personally, I think this one is the best of the Marvel Universe movies so far.  The others have more action and wiz bang... this one had more heart and substance.  It is the only one of them that hits me on an emotional level on top of what is going on.  The character is the most likable of all on the Avengers team... even if he is as not as over the top alpha personality as Tony Stark.  I think its a great movie that does the super hero involved strong justice.  I think the other Marvel Super Hero movies were all good... but this is the one that most made me want to see it again.",1362268800,,587,3.982905982905983

It was a little weird that all but 5 or 10 minutes of the movie was one long flashback. I don't want to give away anything - but they could of skipped all the present-day stuff - and ended the film with the first scene - and I'd have been happier. The very last scene left me with a sad feeling, though most of the movie was very uplifting.",1361923200,,511,3.9134615384615383

4697836,5,B005GYJPYW,"I'm sure the regular followers of my blog are shocked to see that I gave a superhero/comic book movie a perfect rating. It is a well known fact, that while I'm a Science Fiction fanatic, I hate superheroes and comics. I wanted to see Captain America though, because I'm fascinated by the Avengers. I really can't see how all those big stars are going to work together, so I wanted to see all the films leading up to the Avengers, so I could follow along. Tommy Lee Jones, one of my favorite actors of all time, is one of the stars of this film, and I know he won't sign on to do just anything, so I knew that Captain America would at the very least be watchable. The more and more I got into Captain America, the most surprised I was by it's realism and honesty, it's not just the story of another superhero and how he's going to fit into the Avengers, it's the story of a very likeable character who wants to be something more than he is. I also loved the fact that this film took place in the 1940's as opposed to the modern era, because it gave a uniqueness to the story. I didn't feel like I was watching another Superman or Batman type of movie, I was really seeing something unique. The cast was fantastic, Chris Evans in particular, I don't know where the people who do the casting for these movies keep finding these guys, but each newcomer is better than the last. Captain America is unique and doesn't feel like a superhero out of some comic book. Comics are often based in extreme fantasy and appeal to those who want to escape their reality. Captain America was different though as he choses not to runaway, but to continually better himself, making him a uniquely remarkable character and it's those qualities that helped make a unique and remarkable film.",1361491200,,1769,4.412844036697248

4697841,3,B005GYJPYW,"It is 1945, and America is in the long, dark, night of the comic book soul.  Only a whirlwind tour through as many high-production movies as possible will save the day.

It turns out, can you believe it, that the Nazis were more completely evil than we knew.  In a genuine surprise to Adolf Hitler (and don't you wish you also saw the look on his face when he saw it from his special, high-tech moving chair, hey hey!), a German ace has developed his own evil organization, Hydra, which audaciously makes the Roman, I mean Nazi salute with, get this, both arms, and this obviously makes them TWICE as completely evil as puny Hitler's henchmen.  (In the Broadway musical version, with choreography by ""Hank"" Himmler, they goose-step with both feet.  But that is not in this movie.)  They don't even say ""Heil Hitler,"" they say ""Heil Hydra.""  That is how completely, and doubly, evil they are.

The Uber-Red Red Baron has his own plans for world domination, and has kept all the wunderwaffen for himself, including stealth bombers (See Reality or Wonder Woman, whichever you prefer), pseudo-cyborgs (See that strange guy in Washington Square) in black space suits (see Star Wars), and the plan for attacking New York that even Adolf Hitler couldn't realize.  (The stealth planes with the curved-down wings are still secret however.  You're not even supposed to know about them either.  So keep your mouth shut.)  ""Uber-Red"" (see the Stargate Atlantis character ""Oberoth"") has been made into a super-soldier (See Stargate SG1) with the help of a German scientist who switched sides, so at last America stands a chance of having its own German scientist (See Ice Station Zebra).  Germany has all its wonder weapons, including, astonishingly, a super-powered square thingy (See the Star Trek Borg) and all America can do is use the German turncoat's uber-steroids to transform one, single, geek ultra-lite into one, beefcake, Greek hoplite (See Herodotus, but I think the book is better than the movie).

Always keen to keep proper Capitalist priorities (See any Republican rage over ""Freedom""), the US knows just what to do with a superhero: put him on a War Bonds dancing tour with crowds of thick-legged, tiny-breasted chorus girls, in an environment where nobody puts out, some kind of stupid boring Hell for Superheroes (See Cabaret, or just drive a cab on the night shift).  Meanwhile Big Red Baddie, acted by Hugo Weaving at the top of his craft playing supernatural elves (See the Lord of the Rings), moves to become Master of the Universe (See Frank Langela, at the top of his craft playing supernatural vampires in, in fact, Master of the Universe).  The recruiter is a soldier-girl named Carter (See Stargate SG1 again, that was where we learned that soldier-girls keep their genitals on the inside!), who hasn't yet thought of carrying even one riding crop.  Apparently you are expected to opt out of noticing that she has imperfect facial doubles and that her boobs get bigger as the movie progresses - obviously in this alternative universe, the Constitutional Amendment promising Equal Steroid Opportunity has finally passed, and hey, faces can be similar, right?  So what's your problem?

Captain America has his own guys to recruit, including a Negro and a Frenchman (See Hogan's Heroes).  More of an action fighter than Batman and not as super-powered as Spiderman, Captain America, played by Chris Evans, is the stud David Duchovney wishes he was.  More intuitive than most evil types, Weaving's Red Skull is the apotheosis of makeup abuse (See Planet of the Apes).  But his metamorphosis into Redness is handled in an acceptably off-the-shoulder way.  (I really think I get major points for saying so cool a thing so incredibly well.)  In a cameo at the end Samuel L. Jackson ""reprises his role as Nick Fury"" (See Way Too Many Comic Book Movies), to explain why everything is so modern after Cap America wakes up in a hospital in a later era of history than he crash-landed into in the act of saving New York at the end of his mission, and just when we think Cap's going to begin to figure things out and show signs of Capgras Syndrome, because the nurse doesn't quite look enough like his girl, this doesn't actually happen, because some smart film executive decided to make a plot theme out of the imperfect doubles.  (Probably only the Hydra fists were perfect doubles.)  (And the Goose-stepping feet in the Broadway musical that you claim you didn't know about.)  So Cap can't be surrounded by fakes of his familiars, they aren't them, they only look like them, right?  As Nick Fury, Jackson apologizes for the crazy drama, and that makes everything all right.  And I really hope this review closes the file on my interest in the First Avenger.  With the right steroids, any of us could be one.",1361232000,,4813,4.855569155446757

4697844,5,B005GYJPYW,"Iron Man is a hero for today's generation.  My cousin loves Iron Man because, he's cool and charismatic.  I love Captain America because, he's the good guy.  The success of the Marvel movies probably has a lot to do with the apparent trend that people are starving for nostalgia.  So, you can sell-up the cool guy all day long but, in the end, you want the good guy in your foxhole.  You might think that in saying so much, I'm taking this movie to be more than what it is: a movie.  But, you have movies and, you have cinemagic.  The cinemagic are the movies that sweep you up and make you cheer for the characters.  Those are the movies that stick with you because, they embody concepts and, they're cathartic in the way in which theater was intended.

This movie was decent.  I've not seen the Iron Man movies, I've not seen Thor, or The Hulk, but, I have seen The Avengers.  This movie was good; The Avengers was much better.  But, for the way they portrayed Captain America in The Avengers, I had to see this movie.  And, for Captain America, I loved this movie.

I am not a comic book enthusiast but, I know quite a bit about comic book characters.  Nor am I an avid movie go-er.  I do, however remember when they released the previews for Captain America and, I just remember being disappointed, thinking this would be another over-hyped, modernized destruction of a very iconic figure of American culture.  And, given the history behind the Captain America comic books, Captain America is a piece of Americana, in a sense that the current generations can't fathom.  I was tired of the marvel movies, they seemed overdone and, it was a little painful to think that Captain America was going to fall into Hollywood's grasp.

But, to my surprise, the screen writer and director for The Avengers did a really good job of writing the dialogue, to do Captain America some justice.  I felt like they really cared enough about the embodiment of the character to keep the dialogue fairly true to what Captain America should represent.

Now, truthfully, The Avengers would get five stars and, I would probably give Captain America four stars because, there are a few instances where I would've liked to see more of the Captain America from The Avengers in this movie but, it is almost like you get more of the really solid all-American out of the Captain America in The Avengers because he's a contrast to modernity.  Where, in the Captain America movie, he's in his element, he doesn't stand out as much because, every man is nearly as quality as he is, he just happens to be the super soldier but, he's not such a stark contrast of character in comparison to his fellow soldiers.  It's kind of the whole thing about: there's nothing special about him; he's just a kid from Brooklyn.

And, the digital copy of this movie is CHEAPER than some of the others.  So, buy it, watch it, and cheer for Captain America, you who would be commies.",1361145600,,2935,4.555343511450381

4697854,5,B005GYJPYW,"A critical and huge commercial success, this is among my favorites of the comic-book hero movies. Steve Rogers, a 98 lb weakling, who is transformed into the Captain America character, is among the more human of the Marvel Comic Book characters...he has super-human strengths in all areas...but he can be injured...just like us. I like that aspect of the story. I have not read how they transition Chris Evans, from the short, asthmatic Steve Rogers to the muscle bound Captain America, after being injected w/the ""super-soldier serum""; but I'm sure it must have been done w/CGI. The CGI special effects - aside from the transition of Steve Rogers - is stunning...seen it before in other movies, but I never cease to be amazed with the special effects of today's movies. Something else I really liked about this story is that it's set during WW II in the 40s and Captain America is a captain in the American Army fighting the Nazi bad guys in Germany...much more patriotic than most Hollywood films, reminescent of the patriotism on display in movies filmed during the War. In addition to Chris Evans, look for Hugo Weaving, who delivers an outstanding performance as the evil Nazi genius, Johann Schmidt, or ""Red Skull"". He has also received the ""super soldier serum"" but it affects him in different ways...which you'll see as the film develops. Stanley Tucci plays Dr Abraham Erskine, a German expatriot scientist, who developed the ""soldier serum"". Captain America's love interest and British soldier is Peggy Carter, played superbly by Hayley Atwell. Tommy Lee Jones is Col Chester Phillips, Captain America's field commander. Also look for Toby Jones as the vice-villain, Dr Zola; and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, an inventor who is responsible for Captain America's uniform and equipment. Bottom line, this is an excellent cartoon actioner and highly recommended.",1360627200,,1872,5.100977198697068

4697866,4,B005GYJPYW,"The first time I saw this film, I enjoyed it but not as much as, say Iron Man. It was based too much on an old-time mentality and I thought it was a little pat with the WWII hero paladin lead. In retrospect and after more viewing, I realize I was wrong. It's excellent. Chris Evans as the lead walks the very fine and treacherous line between being a too-nice, too-pure hero type and being just really likeable. The whole movie only works because they cast him, sort of like Thor only works because Chris Hemsworth was cast. The side characters here are all flawless in the roles they're given (though any more Hugo Weaving seems to do nothing but dramatic bad guys. Someone give the man a drama please. Not that he isn't great here). Standouts include Tommy Lee Jones doing what he always does but under the radar just a bit. He's as snarky as ever but he never steals the scene. And again--Chris Evans carries the movie by being exactly what Steve Rogers/Captain America needs to be: a little guy who hates bullies and never quits, trapped in the body of a pin-up boy. He makes the man seem real. So it all works.
The BluRay has good extras too, with a commentary for those of us who care, and some really interesting production specials on how they made the very tall, very buff Chris Evans look like a short, skinny 90 pound weakling. It's amazing if only for the technology and how far we've come since early CGI.",1360454400,,1418,4.416030534351145

I do like how this movie uses the costume of the 40s serial as well as the redesigned one later. Great supporting actors, actresses, Tommy Lee Jones is awesome as the hard nosed Officer and Peggy was captain America's love interest. The actor for 'Bucky' was spot on as well as Dum Dum Dugan.

4697902,4,B005GYJPYW,"It's World War II and the US Army needs to up its game in its war against the villainous Nazis under the command of Adolf Hitler.

Enter Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a little guy from Brooklyn with all sorts of health problems, but who has possibly the strongest sense of morals and courage than any man on the front line. Unfortunately, due to his fragility, Steve is not allowed to join the American army despite multiple tries. A scientist experimenting in a super soldier serum for the US army notices this and offers him a chance to take part in a dangerous procedure that, if it goes well, will grant Steve superhuman-like abilities and enable him to be an ultimate man, athlete and warrior. Steve accepts and transforms into the world's first super soldier: Captain America.

Meanwhile, the first test subject of the serum, Johann Schmidt-aka the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)-has come into possession of the Tesseract cube, a powerful energy source rumored to be from Asgard. His plan? Nothing less than overthrowing Hitler himself and taking over the world.

If only we had a super soldier to stop him. Wait . . . we do.

His name is Captain America.

Like all good fanboys, I saw this movie in the theatre. Having grown up on the cheesy Captain America movies starring Reb Brown and, later, the 1990 version with Matt Salinger, a part of me, I admit, was waiting for a repeat of the 1990 film (in the general sense). I was more interested in how Captain America: The First Avenger would tie into the then upcoming Avengers and this movie didn't disappoint.

The introduction of the Tesseract-which would be key in Avengers-was real smart on the filmmakers' part because not only did it point to the forthcoming ensemble film, but also gave a quick link to the Thor movie as well.

Watching Chris Evans as Steve Rogers was fantastic. He really suits the role and played it perfectly. I wasn't sure how the once Human Torch-all witty and sarcastic-would fare as the famous super soldier, and I'm glad Chris Evans proved he can play a kind of Superman-like character as well. Seeing him play both the small, frail Steve Rogers (facially, anyway, as someone else's body was used), to playing the suped-up Steve made the film truly a story about how our greatest power lies within as opposed to externally.

Likewise, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull did a great job, especially since playing villains is no strange task to Weaving (Agent Smith, anyone?). Even with the German haircut he looked different never mind later when his red skull visage was revealed.

The story was simple and, like the first Spider-Man movie, I left the theatre underwhelmed. After seeing it a second time, I saw it for what it was and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the end battle was anti-climatic. It didn't need to be an all-out brawl between Cap and Red Skull, but it felt brief considering these two are the heads and tails of the same coin. Some sort of super soldier/titan clash would have punched up the ending. Speaking of which, the ending of this movie has one of the best last lines to a flick ever. It was the kind of line I try to end my own novels on, one that finishes the tale but also has a punch to it.

As far as superhero stories go, the World War II setting gave the genre a breath of fresh air movie-wise as, thus, far, pretty much every super flick to come out recently is all set in the modern day. Alternate times and/or worlds with a superhero figure are few and far between. The Spirit is the only one that comes to mind in this regard.

After this movie and Avengers, I'm excited to see Captain America: Winter Soldier, which is presently set for 2014.",1359244800,,3656,4.600614439324117

This was purchased on a black friday special (end of November) but the digital download expired the end of October.

I thought that was a little shady.  I was also put off that Amazon couldn't do much about it other than give me a copy on the Amazon Instant Video.  I purchased this solely for the digital copy at that low price, to be used on my iPhone/iPad.  So i can't sync it in iTunes and launch it from the video app, but from Amazon app.

THE WORST OF ALL is that to download a video on the Amazon Instant Video app (iPad) you have to leave the app OPEN, not just running, but open.  So you can't minimize it and do something else in the mean time, they expect you to hit download, then STARE AT THE DOWNLOAD STATUS BAR!  Are you kidding me?  If you minimize it you promptly get an alert that says your download will resume once you relaunch the app.

I didn't have time to connect or fall in love with any of the characters I'm supposed to empathize with. And the allied soldiers have such a hard time fighting the germans until captain america shows up, then its a complete cake walk, even for 400 soldiers to sneak up to the red skull's secret lair.

The part that really takes the cake is how the movie seems to overreach in an obvious attempt to paint women in a better light. Not only is a woman second lieutenant but also the one leading the charge at the end. And really in the entire US Army they couldn't find anyone else for the most important battle of the war? Are there only 5 heads fighting WWII that keep rotating roles? And seriously, all Peggy Carter does is disobey orders and tell Steve Rogers to go ahead and do things that would get any normal man killed. In an era where women had just gained the right to vote, it would be like a civil war story in which an african american was Lincoln's secretary of state.

So in short, no, it was not a good movie.

Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Hugo Weaving have very memorable roles as well.

4698009,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is one of the most beloved Marvel Superheros ever. It's kind of sad that it took this long to get his own movie considering what he represents.  The character of Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans, is an interesting one.  He is small, puny and wants nothing more than to be a soldier in the U.S. Military.  When a doctor creates a serum to help him become physically superior soldier, that's when all the fun happens.  Let's go!

What I liked about the movie:
The Cast

The cast, both starring and supporting, were very impressive in this movie.  I didn't know how to feel about Chris Evans as Captain America.  I always thought he was a good actor for genre films, but didn't know if he could command attention as a superhero.  Rest assured, he's great!  In the first act, pre-serum injections, his acting ability really comes through.  The audience will feel sympathy for the kid from Brooklyn who wants nothing more than to serve his country.  Evans shows us that Steve Rogers was a good MAN, way before he was a good superhero.  Nicely Done!

The supporting cast was very awesome!  Hugo Weaving as the main villain, Red Skull, was great.  Even the cheesy accent was ok with me.  Weaving has the voice, arrogance and presence needed to play the villain.  I enjoyed his work very much.  Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter was a delight on screen, not the usual damsel in distress.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a perfect Colonel in the Military, he is compassionate enough for us to care about him, but stern enough to lead in a war.  Stanley Tucci... is there anything Tucci can't do?!  He's awesome as the Doctor who invents the serum for Steve Rogers.  Sebastian Stan plays Bucky, Steve Rogers best friend, nicely done by the young actor.

The Setting

The movie mostly takes place during World War II.  The production design team does such an amazing job with the set pieces, the costumes, etc.  What's also impressive is the lighting, and camera work.  Shelly Johnson used just the right lighting that gave the movie an older feel without overdoing it.  It was nice to see a superhero film that wasn't in modern day times.

The Story / Writing

Simple, easy to follow and exciting.  Hugo Weaving's character believes in ""magic"" which was stolen from Odin's vault.  It is the Cosmic Cube which has been referenced in the Marvel Universe of films.  It has a great deal of power and, if harnessed correctly, could destroy every major city in the world.  Captain America and company must stop Red Skull from doing so.  The writing is clever and I never rolled my eyes at any horrible dialogue.  The writers were clever and even made fun of the Captain America suit before we could as an audience.  I love when writers acknowledge things like that without making it obvious!

What I liked and didn't like about the film:
The Director

Joe Johnston has done a lot of work in Hollywood.  He made a great name for himself with popular films like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji, October Sky and Jurassic Park III.  I think he's a good storyteller, but there are aspects of his films that just don't click.  His movies always look great, he can always get a terrific cast to work with him, and the stories are usually pretty enticing.  I will tell you this, this movie is MUCH better than the atrocious The Wolfman from a few years ago.  Most of the things I enjoyed in the film are because of him.  As are the things I didn't enjoy.

What I didn't like about the film:
The Action

It's too bad, this is an action film and the action is silly.  There are multiple action scenes with hundreds of henchmen at war with our Military.  Henchmen and soldiers alike are being killed so often, we don't feel any real loss.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, action should only compliment the story, not take it over.  The final action sequence was impressive though with many intricate camera shots.  Didn't totally leave a sour taste in my mouth.

The Score

I feel I pay very close attention to film scores.  I can tell you which ones work and which ones don't in my opinion.  The average movie going public probably doesn't even care, but I do!  It didn't evoke emotion, it didn't make me care and I never felt like I was pulled into 100%.  The score should have been big, uplifting even.  This is Captain America damn it!  He's viewed as the leader of The Avengers and the score should have matched.

The Verdict:
Liked it very much

I enjoyed the movie very much.  I know I listed a few things I didn't like, but they weren't deal breakers.  It was great to see a modern day superhero in the past.  We grow with the character, figuratively and literally.  Steve Rogers is a good man who just lacked the physical stature to do great things.  He stood up for those who are bullied and did what was right.  I can't wait for The Avengers next year, it will be another chance to see Captain America in action!",1356220800,8,4930,4.5

How different those films are!

The Dark Knight is NOT a popcorn film. It's a thriller, and an action movie. It's a dark, unforgettable, violent, gripping, intense, suspenseful, sometimes disturbing, but always brilliant film.

On the other hand, Captain America is pure FUN. It's escapism, blockbuster entertainment. A film filled with humor, improbable but exciting set pieces, dastardly villains (Nazis!), memorable characters, one-liners, heart (lots of it), and wonderful acting!
Shall I run through the cast for you? Here goes (*deep breath*): Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones, Stanley Tucci, Dominic Cooper, Richard Armitage, and Samuel L. Jackson!

And Captain America has one more thing to reccomend itself to you...a memorable Stan Lee cameo!

In conclusion, Captain America: The First Avenger is a wonderfully entertaining, action-packed, well-acted, stylish, incredibly humorous, retro throwback to blockbusters of old such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Strongest Recommendation!!!",1353888000,3,1301,6.540697674418604
4698067,1,B005GYJPYW,"In spite of the high quality of recent superhero films, this movie seems rushed. The visuals and effects are not up to modern standards. Chris Evans only has one memorable scene and it is his very last one in the movie.

4698079,3,B005GYJPYW,"Joe Johnston has done it again, managing to take what SHOULD be great action flick material and managed to make it, well, boring.

Don't get me wrong, the film started out quite well. The change from puny wimp to super hero was well done, as was the intro sequence with red skull. The whole nazi-mysticism mystique was done very well. But it seemed that after Joe Johnston filmed these two or three well thought out portions, the rest of the film was just filler.

I caught myself looking at my watch a few times, just sort of wanting the movie to end - and this was at the 1/2 point of the film. The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that ""edge of my seat"" feeling as the characters faced peril.

I enjoyed the back story and really love how they developed the Captain America character throughout the movie.  They made him noble and caring, which he always has been (based on what my friends have told me about the comic books, er, I mean graphic novels).

The movie fits into the setup for the Avengers movie and is just a feel good movie.  Yes, there's a bad guy that does not look like the rest of us, but hey, that's what you expect from a comic series!

All I can say is, ""Sit back and enjoy stepping back in time to simple story and a main character you can enjoy for his idealism.""",1350691200,,746,4.21830985915493

4698103,1,B005GYJPYW,"I don't even know where to begin.  I guess I should just get the ""its part of the marvel universe and thus HAS to tie in to the other movies"" disclaimer out there.  Which should surprise nobody of course but it does lend credence to the fact that the movie is a total joke.  There are so many pathetic attempts to tie in the rest of the marvel charactors.  The blue light/energy in the beginning being from Norse Gods (Thor), having Stark personally fly the plane behind enemy lines (Ironman).  Seriously?  Why would a billionaire arms dealer even have been in Italy during that scene?  Ill tell you why, retarded writing and needs to get the movie more tie ins with the rest of the stupid Avengers movies.  I guess I should admit that I am not a fan of comic books or the idea of superpowers.  HOWEVER, with a good story I will enjoy just about anything. However Captain America is NOT a clever, well written story.  Its more like a Michael Bay explosion fest for 10 year old boys.

The movie follows Steve a little guy who wants to join the Army and fight for America. Hes been turned down a bunch of times due to all kinds of medical problems.  So naturally the scientist in charge of a trillion dollar experiment chooses him to be his main test subject.  I mean its not like the procedure was supposed to hurt and require... resilience or anything.  Oh wait a second... So Steve is now Captain America and all buffed out and becomes a celebrity and he gets put to work selling bonds and raising morale. Apparently this is a bad thing?  I guess nobody told that to President Reagan or Bob Hope who did WAY more in said capacities than they could have contributed on the front lines (unless they had a trashcan lid shield that is).  But I digress.  So Captain America decides to go in alone without any intelligence on a heavily fortified Hydra facility where his best bud is a POW and working like a slave along with a ton of other POWs.  Naturally Captain America gets in {thanks to his girlfriend some British chick who for some reason only works with Americans and her friend Tony (or whatever) Stark the aforementioned billionaire arms dealer and scientist who also pilots suicide missions behind enemy lines on his days off apparently}.  So Captain America gets in and beats the ONE guard watching over the POWs and sets them loose.  They rush outside into like 200 guards and of course being unarmed and the guards carrying like blue laser-RPG-machine guns the POWs just whoop the crap out of the guards and break loose. At that point I just stopped watching due to the ridiculously poor EVERYTHING in this movie.  The only character in the movie who I had found believable before I tuned out was the Colonel, played by Tommy Lee Jones.  But as decent a job as he did, he is not worth suffering through this garbage heap of a movie.  Save your time and watch one of the new Batmans if you absolutely need a superhero movie.  Or wait for Man of Steel (2013) which although a superhero movie is being produced by Christopher Nolan so there is a chance it will actually have a story meant provoke intelligent thought and not just a tie in for *Aquaman 3D or some such garbage.",1349568000,7,3182,4.465397923875432

4698106,4,B005GYJPYW,"Joe Johnston (director) has worked on some of my favorite movies and directed one of my favorite movies and this just didn't live up to my expectations. Granted it's better than a lot of the other ""comic book movies"" I've watched over the years, but still not a great movie. Joe Johnston started his career in film working on effects for Empire and Raiders and ended up directing the Rocketeer (a far better comic book movie than this) and didn't do too much else through the rest of the `90's and `00's. I thought he was a great choice to helm this franchise seeing as how he has already tackled a comic book movie from the same genre. But this movie is flat in dialogue and story, the effects are well done but the art design seems boring and border line generic. I wanted to like this movie more than I did, but I can't like it for what I wanted it to be, I can only kind of like it for what it is. I can't complain about the acting or music or pacing, just that it seems to be lacking depth and heart. The extra features are on the weak side. This movie looks great on Blu-Ray, it's sharp and has great detail. If you love The Rocketeer, or Indian Jones or good comic book movies like Batman (1989), The Avengers and Ironman, this movie may seem a bit disappointing.

4698110,4,B005GYJPYW,"While some of the Marvel superhero films don't do a great job of adhering to the source material, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) does better than most, as it succeeds in capturing to a large degree, the spirit of the comics which saw the genesis of the character during World War II.  The film features Captain America battling his greatest and most ruthless adversary, Red Skull, the personification of Nazi cunning and fighting spirit, and the leader of the Third Reich's secret weapons branch.

In superhero movies, setup and character origins typically eat up a nice chunk of time in the initial film.  That is somewhat true here, but the process is streamlined by Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the future Captain America, not having a complicated backstory, and the action being set in the already familiar setting of World War II.

The year is 1942, and a patriotic Steve Rogers has once again been classified 4F, and rejected by the army.  Recruited by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), the scrawny Rogers finds himself in uniform, as a volunteer in a top secret experimental program to develop an enhanced fighting man.  The process is successful, as Rogers becomes a muscular specimen, but when Erskine is assassinated, the secret of the process is lost.

Instead of an army of supersoldiers, there is just Rogers, and as the costumed ""Captain America"" he is used mainly as a public relations tool for the red, white, and blue.  Under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), Rogers is in Italy entertaining the troops, when he learns that his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been reported missing, while battling German forces led by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).  With the help of British intelligence agent Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), Rogers embarks on an unauthorized rescue mission.

Dressed as Captain America, Rogers frees Barnes and other American soldiers being held prisoner.  Schmidt the leader of a force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.  Rogers puts together a strike force, and sets out to destroy all of HYDRA's forces, leading to a dramatic final battle with Red Skull, and setting the stage for Captain America's appearance in The Avengers (2012).

With World War II as the canvas against which the action takes place, Captain America: The First Avenger successfully captures some of the spirit of the comics, while adding a ton of high-tech enhancements.  There isn't much time devoted to character development, as director  Joe Johnson focuses on keeping things moving, and making the second half of this darkly atmospheric fantasy, as action oriented as possible.

Although the war becomes a complete parody, borrowing from films like Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America is still one of the better Marvel adaptations to date.  With a rating of 4.5 stars, don't miss this one while it is available on Amazon Prime.",1348099200,,2988,5.040650406504065

4698113,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: the First Avenger is one of the greatest movies ever! Chris Evans is an amazing actor, and in this movie he seems totally to really be in the time. All the characters actually seem to belong in the 1940's, not thrown in. I am a thirteen-year-old girl who likes Marvel in general, but anybody can appreciate the story of Steve Rogers, the guy who became Captain America.

Unlike some other Marvel characters (e.g. Iron Man, who is very great but it has to be admitted is far from the perfect true hero), Steve is a really good, likable guy, who constantly tries to do what's right. He puts others before himself and is constantly showing self-sacrificing courage and honest humility. He is the ideal American and an amazing human being. To top it all off, he is - of course - the perfect soldier, thanks to an expirimental perfectionizing thing preformed on him by a generous scientist.

Peggy, a British army recruit, is a great character as well. I always find it indredibly nice when people are able to create a female character who is strong, tough, and brave; yet she still gets to have an amazing man risk his life for her. That is what they have cleverly done with Peggy and Steve.

I won't spoil the plot, but the ending is just sad. Alright... if you wanna know the sad ending, read the next paragraph. If you don't, then skip it. Just know the ending is sad, but not so sad that it's not worth watching. It's totally worth watching.

SPOILER ENDING: So, after an amazing fight with the Red Skull, Steve ends up frozen in the ice, wakes up in a fake 40's hospital, realizes it's not real and breaks out, only to be dazzled by the 21st century before him. Suddenly he comes face to face with Commander Nick Fury of S.H.E.I.L.D., organizer of the Avengers. So it is that Captain America is called the First Avenger. And, Steve misses Peggy already (who according to other resources, i.e. comics, is still alive but is an old woman.) That's the sad ending.

And so, the movie ends heartachingly, begging for a sequel. On to 2012's The Avengers! But basically, Captain America: the First Avenger is awesome. If you haven't yet, you should definitely watch it.",1347580800,,2180,4.579487179487179
4698114,3,B005GYJPYW,"This is a very good movie. Interesting plot. Good acting. Excellent cinematography. My biggest complaint is: I bought this movie for the 3D effect.

If you have seen any of the IMAX 3D movies and use it as a standard, then this movie comes up way short of standard.

What I did not know at the time is this and several others were tying into the Avengers. Anyway I thought this movie was fantastic and seeing Chris Evans shrunk down to that small and sickly looking was amazing and it looked completely believable. Then when he stepped out of that chamber and was transformed to the absolutely ripped and super buff Cap it was something to behold. He pulls off looking like that and not being arrogant about it and he could easily act like that. He actually seems to be the wholesome and naive guy he portrays. I think he pulls it off because he is nice without being a pushover and it comes across in his acting(seen enough extra stuff to believe that, not just be a actor groupie). He is a great actor in my estimation. Hugo Weaving is always amazing in whatever he does. From Agent Smith to Megatron's voice to Red Skull he is a superb actor. I thought it was an interesting concept on how to get Captain America from the 1940's to current time. Some do not like it, but I did. I highly recommend this movie. It is entertaining and frankly the patriotism portrayed in this movie was refreshing to see. I am looking forward to the second Captain America movie in 2014.",1347321600,,1392,4.378378378378378

I'm gonna make this kinda short and say that the main problem I had with this movie was that there was a lot of talking and explaining stuff (lots of these superhero movies are so serious at times lately!) and NOT ENOUGH ACTION. Where was it? Sure there is a pretty girl at Captain America's side and for anyone who cares, Captain America is played by the hottie Chris Evans who is seen shirtless a few times so there's that part of it. But to me there just wasn't enough fighting and fast-paced things going on in this mostly slower-moving movie. The action that did take place was fine and the scene where he is trying to escape a place that will soon explode with a friend was very gripping and kept my attention, but honestly there wasn't that much to work with here. I don't wanna step on any toes here when I say this, but I'd take any of the first 3 Spiderman movies over this one (oversensitive Pete and all). I liked those movies anyway.

4698136,3,B005GYJPYW,"""Captain America"" is a well-crated redux of clichs, and in this, it's the superhero version of ""American Beauty."" If you like ""Captain America"" -- and given its acting and production values, you probably will - it's because you've seen it all before somewhere else. You can tick off the standards: outcast superhero, Steve Rogers (who's basically the kid that gets sand kicked in his face in those comic book Charles Atlas ads), eccentric but well-meaning scientist with the German-Jewish accent (Albert Einstein, Hans Zarkhov, etc.), sadistic Nazi bastard (take your pick, Indiana Jones movies, The Phantom, The Rocketeer, The Marathon Man, etc.). It's full of romanticized 40s nostalgia, so much so that everyone, even the baddies, is apple-cheeked and there's no need to put minorities in it unless they accidentally walk by in the background. Captain America himself is Hitler's wet dream in the sense that our buff, blond and blue-eyed Olympian is essentially everything the Germans were after, the master race but on our side, by golly, and since Hitler's evil and we're not, it's all okay (and he's got that nifty, muted American flag costume to remind us). None of this is a problem necessarily, but to enjoy ""Captain America,"" you have to be prepared for it. If not, you'll find it pure corn and not a little propagandistic, albeit with a slick retro quality that might make you want to believe the world was ever actually like this. If your politics run toward accusing Hollywood of liberalism, you'll find this movie difficult to fit into that viewpoint.  There's not much to say about the plot.  There's an evil Nazi running around with his own agenda and a wholesome hero who must stop him.  That's about it.  The rest is a well-photographed exercise in flag waving. Chris Evans, who looks like a less creepy version of Ryan Gosling, is fine in the limited role, and his female handler, played by Hayley Atwell, is basically today's version of Emma Peel. Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, and Tommy Lee Jones are quite competent. The film reminded me of Disney's ""The Rocketeer,"" which wasn't surprising given that both were directed by Joe Johnston, who gives the whole thing a Steven Spielberg gloss when he was in his prime. Though I had to fight to stay awake in parts and was a little distracted, I'm not sure that was entirely the movie's fault, but I will say watching it was the equivalent of eating a Big Mac on a full stomach.",1343952000,,2444,4.839712918660287

Chris Evans makes a wonderful Captain America giving his character an innocence and essential decency that never becomes preachy or camp. Hayley Atwell is good as the love interest and Dominic Cooper also stood out as Iron Man's dad (he did a lot with a little, IMO).

4698146,4,B005GYJPYW,"After years of awaiting a movie worth this historically rich character's name, I'm happy to announce that a good Captain America film finally here. I was quite blown away by how much I enjoyed it. My fear of the worst kept my expectations in check as I waited for The First Avenger to hit theaters. For a while, I expected it to be mediocre to moderately good, but I retained a cautious optimism. I didn't have enough faith in it to hype the movie up to friends and family, but I prayed it would be as good as the previous films in the Avengers Saga. Being a huge Marvel fan, I was obliged to see it no matter how good or bad critics said it was. Surprisingly, it turned out to be just what Joe Johnston's credentials promised. It was a good old fashioned throwback action adventure flick that's fun (for the family, despite a few shockingly violent moments), humorous, and surprisingly, emotionally resonant. I thought it was a notch or two above Thor, albeit I wouldn't recommend one over the other. Johnston's last few films (The Wolfman, Jurassic Park III and Hidalgo -- two of which I actually enjoyed) didn't have great receptions, so it was understandable for most to be weary of him directing, but I think he did a damn good job with material that had the potential to be very silly. The character, Captain America, is one of those characters that everyone knows of, but not many people care about. He probably comes across as a boring character, due to his overtly American themes, simplistic superpowers, and his shield.

In fact, the film could have easily been quite boring, or laughably silly, but I'm pleased to say that this movie is none of the above, and neither are most of Cap's latest publishings, to be honest. This is a classic case of not judging a book by its cover. Granted, there are inherently cheesy moments throughout the film, but what do you expect from an apparent propaganda piece about an unlikely soldier with an American flag costume and a big shield, who is battling an evil Nazi with red skin that is bent on world domination? I actually loved the cheese factor. It went quite well with the 40's WWII atmosphere, and the film as a whole. Like I mentioned before, this film was a throwback to the old fashioned action adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Rocketeer (another Johnston film). There's an automatic cheese factor that goes with the territory. Early flags were raised by internet dwellers about Chris Evans not being right for the leading role. I never bought into those complaints. I mean, have you guys seen him? Blonde hair, blue eyes, quirky innocence, toned body, and actual acting abilities (if you've seen him in anything besides Fantastic Four -- which he was actually one of the best aspects of). What the hell else did we need for him to be right for the role? I don't know, but I had faith in him and he delivered. Some people have said that he was bland and just a good guy with no internal conflict, and for the most part, I agree. That's who he is supposed to be though. His character was developed as he grew up, due to him being physically inane. That was the very reason why Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruited him.

I loved Evans as Steve Rogers, and even more as Cap. He just flat out kicked ass, in my opinion. He went against what we've become accustomed to in superhero movies, and it worked well. Spoilers: When Cap threw a knife into a Hydra agents back, then threw two other Hydra agents right out of a plane, I knew his portrayal would be a legend for years to come. I really was not expecting that kind of brutality in a cartoonish comic book movie where us older fans have come to expect major toning down for young children. I mean, he is a soldier, and this is a war, but you get my point. It would be asinine for him to go through all of that trouble trying to enlist and getting turned down, only to go overseas and just knock his enemies out. Killing is what war is about, so hats off to Johnston and his writers, as well as Marvel Studios and Paramount for having the testicular fortitude to let that happen in The First Avenger. Another surprisingly violent moment was when the older woman in the hidden base got shot and we actually saw the impact. Well, she did have a machine gun, but even so, I applaud them again for letting that happen in a family blockbuster. It added to the seriousness of the situation, and left more of an impact. The audience should take from that, that the Nazi spy who gunned down the older women needed to be taken down as soon as possible. While I did appreciate the mature sparks of violence, there were also other noticeable tone downs that conflicted with them.

Now I'll admit that this is just me nitpicking, but that's what reviews are for, right? Similar to the Decepticon canons in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I have to say that I was distracted by the way that Hydra's advanced weapons disintegrated their victims, pretty much reducing them to dust, instead of actually showing the devastation of the weapons like they did with regular guns. I'm not saying that it was necessary to show blood splatter when the cosmic blasts impacted. I understand the ratings system, but what they chose to do was pushing it, even for science fiction. Speaking of those weapons, some have argued that they seemed more appropriate for a film set in the future, more so than one set in the 1940's. That is an understandable quibble, but that was the point. The cosmic cube allowed Hydra to develop weaponry that was far beyond anything from the time period. That was why Red Skull went through such lengths to attain the cube, and develop the Hydra tech with it. Speaking of Red Skull, I have to say I loved him in this movie. Perhaps he was not as menacing as he could have been, but, I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Hugo Weaving should just play villains in everything for the rest of his career. He does it too well. After seeing his performance, I cannot think of another actor who I would have chosen over him. I'm glad to have him immortalized in the Marvel Universe now, and I hope he returns for the sequel. I'm sure he will because he's obviously not dead, only teleported to another dimension or plane. Actually, I think the whole cast was great.

Haley Atwell was probably the best main love interest of all the Avengers Saga films, which is surprising given she's the least recognizable of all of the actresses who played them. If I were to rank them, I'd do it as follows: Haley Atwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman, and lastly, Liv Tyler. As for Atwell's character, Peggy Carter, I loved how they chose to keep her sexiness hidden until she appeared in that stunning red dress. Her character was introduced as a tough one, but she showed compassion towards Steve. She was a very well developed character, and I'll be sorely disappointed if this is the last we see of her. Spoilers: The moment she and Steve shared before he crashed into the ice was moving, and as I was feeling for them, I was quite surprised that this film managed elicit such an emotional response from me. The same film that I feared would be drowned in mediocrity. They did such a fantastic job at developing thirt relationship. Sadly, I'm pretty sure this is her only outing. There were quite a few moments when I sincerely cared for the fate of the characters. Not only Steve and Peggy, but Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as well. He has one of the saddest, and most surprising moments in the film. Even as a fan of the comics, who knew what would happen to Bucky, as well as who he later becomes, I have to admit that moment got me. I mentioned Stanley Tucci briefly before, but I didn't say that I enjoyed his performance as the doctor responsible for Steve's transformation. I thought Tucci did a pretty good job with the minimal screentime he had.

What more can one say about Tommy Lee Jones that hasn't been said before? He was primarily comic relief, and he was quite funny. Dominic Cooper (The Devil's Double, An Education) was an appropriate choice as Howard Stark. He was a nice counterpart to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. I was pleased with the Howling Commandos as well. Neal McDonough was great as Dum Dum Doogan. His character wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked, considering the role he played in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s development, but he was fine nonetheless. Now all of this praise is not to say that I don't think the film is flawed. It's far from perfect, and many people will most likely have issues with the overall cheesiness of the plot and stereotypical portrayals of the characters, but I enjoyed it very much. It was a great tie-in to the Avengers Saga, but nothing took precedence over Cap's origin story. This is first, and foremost, a Captain America film. The build up for The Avengers has been an exciting one to experience. Each link in the chain is solid, with some obviously being stronger than others. I think Captain America: The First Avenger falls in at second best in the series, after the first Iron Man. As for the transfer, the picture quality is as good as one would expect a modern release to look. Detail is strong and fairly crisp, although some may confuse the Director and Cinematographer's choice of dim lighting and color timing as soft. The sound is pretty much flawless. As far as the extras go, they leave a lot to be desired. The best of the bunch is without a doubt, the commentary. The featurettes, as well as the Marvel One-Shot, are short, but sweet. All in all, I highly recommend it.

The introduction of Captain America was truly imaginative. Unfortunately I waited until after I saw The Avengers before viewing Captain America so I missed some of the references.

4698148,2,B005GYJPYW,"I'm giving this film 2 stars because I simply couldn't sit through the second hour of the film and wanted to give it some benefit of the doubt.

What forced me to choose not to finish the film:
The film starts out ok, but after the experiment, the film just gets cheesy and stupid.  You're greeted by dumb one-liners that aren't funny and the film gets tiring incredibly fast.  If the dialogue had been predictable, that would have been fine, but it was unpredictably dumb.

Frankly, it seems that whoever wrote the script just thought: ""I've got to get all these different elements of CA in the film - how can I do that as quickly as possible.""

I'll say this: if you have a child who has no concept of WW2, military matters, how to hold and fire a gun, and can't understand the English language: they very well might enjoy this film.",1341446400,,835,4.396103896103896
4698149,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a fun action film with a lot of heart in it.

The story is about Steve Rogers, a young New Yorker in 1942 who wants to sign up to fight in World War II. The problem is he's a 90-pound weakling with health problems, i.e. 4F material, more so than even George Bailey. He winds up in a special secret U.S. Army unit that is working on a super-soldier serum. He is selected to take the serum which turns him into a lean, sleek, taller fighting man. Of course an enemy spy sneaks in and blow up the equipment and shoots the head scientist, so Rogers is the only one of his kind. He fights against the Nazis and their special secret unit, Hydra, that has its own plans for world domination.

The movie hits all the WWII tropes: liberating POW camps, jumping motorcycles, flying fortresses, attacking a train in motion, assaulting secluded mountain hideaways, moving plastic pieces on a giant table map, parachuting behind enemy lines, drinking in smoky bars, etc. etc. They come off not so much as cliches but as homages to the great WWII flicks that came before.

Chris Evans gives a great performance as Steve Rogers. He communicates the decency and honesty of the character and is as convincing emotionally as physically. Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull gives a good performance though I couldn't shake the feeling his German accent was an imitation of Werner Herzog. The rest of the cast is convincing and enjoyable.

It's not a perfect film but it is a ton of fun and surprisingly patriotic and heart-warming without being ham-fisted or overly melodramatic.",1341273600,2,1592,4.675

4698151,4,B005GYJPYW,"Having watched Iron Man, Hulk and Thor movies, I have to say Captain America was by far the best Avenger movie to-date.  Chris Evans brings a lot of pathos to the character before he becomes a super human being.  As always Stanley Tucci (even though was part of the movie for such a short time) does an outstanding job.  I've watched the movie only twice, but I know I'll go back and watch it again a few times.",1341014400,,411,4.243589743589744

4698153,4,B005GYJPYW,"Marvel Films had been working toward late April/early May of 2012--and ""Marvel's The Avengers""--since 2003, when the studio did the Ang Lee version of ""Hulk"".  The Eric Bana-led story was a fail, but the second swing in 2008--""The Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton--was better.  The two ""Iron Man"" movies have been brilliantly driven by Robert Downey Jr.'s take on Tony Stark, and ""Thor""--released in the spring of 2011--introduced Chris Hemsworth as the imperious Asgardian Thunder God.
  But setting up for the Avengers couldn't be done without introducing Steve Rogers.  Hence, we had the last prequel to ""The Avengers"" appear in July of 2011.
  To me, it seemed as if Marvel Films and Paramount Studios took an interesting risk in casting Chris Evans to play Steve Rogers.  Evans, to me, seemed dicey here because he had already had a little history in the Marvel Films' Universe--playing Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four films--and also because he seemed to specialize in the smart-alecky slacker type (Jensen in ""The Losers"", Ryan in ""Cellular"" in addition to Johnny Storm).
  As it turned out...I shouldn't have worried.  Evans--in what is essentially the origin story of Captain America--brought the severity and the responsibility of Steve Rogers to the fore, along with a naivete in the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie, when Rogers is the 100-pound physical weakling who is all heart and courage (The CGI that pares Evans down and attaches Evans' head to that small body is a sight to behold).  Once Rogers gets the Super-Soldier serum/Vita-Rays treatment...well, YOU KNOW.
  The movie, to a certain extent, plays like a an old Saturday-afternoon serial.  We meet the bad guy--Johann Schmidt and his science/magic related wing of the German Military during WWII, which allows for the introduction of the long-time antagonist group of the Marvel Universe--HYDRA--to be introduced.  Of course, Schmidt has a case of acne gone really bad--having been introduced to the same Super-Soldier formula that turned Rogers into Cap and amplified Rogers' strengths, Schmidt's viciousness and cruelty ends up being amplified in turning him into The Red Skull.  It's a great performance by Hugo Weaving in the introduction of Cap's greatest foe, and the prosthetics are dead on.
  This movie also allowed for a fuller fleshing out of the legend of Bucky Barnes.  Rather than go for the ""Batman/Robin"" dynamic, Sebastian Stan played James Buchannan Barnes as a young adult; the protector for Steve Rogers pre-formula.  Plus, the introduction of the Howlin' Commandos--sans Nick Fury--was nice.  Neal McDonough gave a solid turn as ""Dum-Dum"" Dugan, and Kenneth Choi's Jim Morita was good.
  The supporting players were solid, overall.  Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter believes in Steve's heroism.  Stanley Tucci's Abraham Erskine believes in Steve's heart and sense of right.  Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark seems a slightly less manic version of RDJ's Tony.  Tommy Lee Jones...well, he's Tommy Lee Jones, no matter what the role at this point in his career.  In this case, as Colonel Chester Phillips, he is the last to see that Rogers can be the brave and heroic leader of men.  Once he does see it, he embraces it wholly.
  Some have called the ending contrived, a vehicle to bring Captain America forward for ""The Avengers"".  But the end has been part of the Captain America legend for over 45 years.  It fit into the storyline.
  Overall, a wholly entertaining story...and the last piece of the table-setting in preparation for ""The Avengers"".
  Highly recommended.",1340668800,2,3588,5.154246100519931
4698154,3,B005GYJPYW,"Okay, let me start this off by saying that the character of Captain America is one of my most favorite characters, and the movie really stayed true to that. Seriously, I would very willingly have Captain America's baby's.

That being said, the movie was rather slow in parts, and even the really intense parts of the movie struck me as a bit overdone, and even boring, but I could just be jaded. Overall, there were a few glimmering, memorable moments, but mostly a poorly written story and vaguely cute dialogue.

If you're a Marvel fan or a superhero fan, watch the movie. Otherwise, it's nothing terribly special-- just another cute face, hot pair of abs, relationship drama and....a fairly decent ending. The ending was one of the redemptive qualities of this movie, and definitely plays into The Avengers' dialogue.",1340409600,,820,4.892086330935252
4698155,4,B005GYJPYW,"The movie awesome. I can't wait until the second installment of Captain America. Also putting Captain America in with the other Avengers (Ironman, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow was a stroke of genius).",1340236800,,207,5.117647058823529
4698156,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America (created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby) has long been one of my favorite superheroes. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to put him up there with the ""Big Three"": Superman, Batman and Spider-Man. So, needless to say, I was quite stoked when 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was first announced.

Still shots released in March of 2011 in ""USA Today"" only further whetted my appetite to see this movie. Even before the still were released, the news that actor Chris Evans had signed to play the lead role had me excited about this movie; Having seen Evans in ""Cellular"" and the two ""Fantastic Four"" films, I have always believed he was ""the right role"" away from being an A-list actor in Hollywood. ""Captain"", and this year's ""Avengers"", have brought him (in my opinion) even closer to the aforementioned status.

Evans is surrounded with an exceptional cast. The lovely Hayley Atwell is Peggy Carter, Cap's superior office and love interest. Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones is Col. Chester Phillips (Cap's CO). Sebastian Stan and Dominic Cooper play Bucky Barnes (Cap's best friend) and Howard Stark (Iron Man's dad), respectively.

Stanley Tucci (Dr. Abraham Erskine), Samuel L. Jackson (Sgt. Nick Fury) and Hugo Weaving, as the film's villian: Nazi Red Skull, round out this exceptional cast.

The film is set in the midst of World War II. The Nazis have a secret organization, HYDRA, that collects and analyzes mystic artifacts in order to use them as weapons against the Allied Forces. A glowing blue, cubed object, known as the Tesseract (and, as we know from the other Avenger movies, was once owned by the god Odin) is Red Skull's mission: to harness and control the unimaginable power of it for the Nazis.

Captain America's mission is to stop him.

But, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Captain America is Steve Rogers. A young man from Brooklyn who wants more than anything to join the Army and fight the nazi menace. But he is too frail to join: he attempts to several times but keeps getting the dreaded 4-F (unfit for combat).

However, what he lacks in size, he more than makes up for in heart, courage and intelligence. This is recognized by Dr. Abraham Erskine, creator of the super soldier serum, who handpicks Rogers as the soldier to receive it. Dr. Erskine gets Cap, er, Rogers admitted into the Army and after Rogers shows his bravery and intelligence, he receives the serum.

Unfortunately, a nazi intelligence officer manages to kill Dr. Erskine and destroy the serum, so Captain America is destined to be the only recipient of it. With this powerful soldier under their command, the US Army decides to keep him off the battlefields and use him instead to raise money at home for the war effort.

Cap finally gets a break. While overseas, ""entertaining"" the troops (they aren't buying: ""bring back the girls!""), Cap sneaks away with a regiment and safely brings back a captured United States squad.

Now, with the powers that be, and the US soldiers firmly behind him, Cap leads successful assault after assault, all throughout Europe, on the Nazis...leading to a dramatic confrontation with the Red Skull for control of the Tesseract.

I will not reveal what happens in Cap's confrontation with the Red Skull...but I will say this: The movie ends with Captain America standing in the midst of Times Square, in present day (2011) America. Sgt. Nick Fury shows up to explain just how he got here.

Furthermore, I'll say this...the beginning of the movie also gives away the fact that Cap is going to be transported from the 1940's into present-day America...even the movie's trailers show Cap in Times Square talking to Nick Fury.

This is my main concern with this film. It is quite entertaining, but because you know Cap is going to wind up in the present day, it is a bit deflating. Cap has a blossoming romance going with Peggy Carter, but you know it isn't meant to be...unless somehow she also ends up in present day America for 2014's scheduled, ""Captain America 2"".

The movie's other problem is that its ending is rushed, which is a shame because the movie's pace builds very well (they particularly do a great job of pacing with Cap's origin story) but then, boom!--The movie's over. Due to this, I have to rate the movie at 3.5 stars, and I'll round to four for my official rating. If this had been a ""stand-alone"" movie with a better ending (and not just a vehicle for Marvel to introduce Captain America's character for this year's mega-blockbuster, ""The Avengers""), I think its score might have been somewhere along the lines of 9 out of 10.

At least, thankfully, the movie does keep Captain America true to his roots: God and country; and VERY patriotic...and does so in a way that does not come off as ""cheesy"".  Because of this (and because of an exceptional performance from an equally exceptional cast), in spite of the movie's one glaring flaw, it still can be termed a success. And, worth a look.

A few more notes:

The visuals in this movie are stunning. The streets of Brooklyn have a grainy, ""browned page,"" pulp-ish look to them. Also, early on in the movie, Steve (pre-Cap) and Bucky, along with their dates, visit the World's Fair and it looks nothing short of beautiful as it smoothly melds together a futuristic and 1940's look. On the big screen, I thought the firework filled sky at the World's Fair looked nothing short of breathtaking.

The scenes of Captain America in action in Europe are nothing short of spectacular, too. Cap, in his powder-blue suit--which blends so well into the snowy fields and woods used for battle backgrounds--looks very, very sharp. In particular, there is a scene where Cap and his men rappel onto the top of a speeding Nazi train (again, with the same snowy background) that only the big screen can do justice to.

Kudos to Director Joe Johnston, a George Lucas protege, for doing an outstanding job with the look and feel of this movie...I only imagine what he could have done if the material given to him hadn't been limited...

Thank you for reading.

4698157,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was yet another wonderful Marvel adaptation for the big screen.  It has a brave superhero, a super evil villain, a little romance, and a lot of action.

The story starts on a very puny Steve Rogers (Chris Evans).  He so desperately wants to join the army and fight the Nazis, but he has multiple physical problems (including being short, weak, and having asthma).  A German doctor/scientist (the incredibly talented Stanley Tucci) sees the goodness within Steve and enlists him to join an experimental project.  Although Steve struggles with the physical training, he clearly has the most heart and is chosen to undergo the first procedure.

As expected, the experiment goes off without fail (enter in Tony Stark's dad to provide the technology!) and Steve is transformed into a buff, unstoppable hero.  Unfortunately, the good doctor is killed and Steve is relegated to the menial job of selling war bonds.  So degrading!  He dutifully does his part until on one tour of Europe, he finds out his best friend and hundreds of other Allies are captured as POWs.  He must come to their rescue!  He must also battle a very bad guy, Red Skull (played by the masterfully evil Hugo Weaving), who seeks to control all of Europe with his futuristic technology.

Chris Evans is amazing as Steve Rogers.  He played The Human Torch in Fantastic Four and it was not that great.  But he steps into the role of Captain America as if he was born to play it.  Captain America is the ultimate hero, brave and good-hearted.  This is such a fun movie and I loved it!",1339891200,,1557,4.711111111111111

Steve Rogers is such a kind and humble man, in spite of the awesome power he posseses. He also manages to make you proud to be an American, not because he goes around flaunting America's greatness, but because he just lives such an honorable and virtuous life. He experiences very real obstacles, not just Nazis (or rather Hydra), but also a buerocratic command structure, his own early physical limitations, and the loss of friends.

4698165,5,B005GYJPYW,"In the 1940's, an exceptionally brave, noble, good, and patriotic young man named Steve Rogers is desperate to join the army and do his part fighting the Nazis in World War II. Unfortunately, he is also exceptionally small, weak, and asthmatic. But, when a particular scientist takes note of his determination and amazing goodness, Steve is recruited to be the subject of a groundbreaking super-soldier experiment that transforms him into ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". From there on, we follow Captain Rogers as he struggles to take his fight from the home front propaganda circuit to the battle overseas, where he finds himself up against the original guinea pig of the super soldier syrum, the megalomaniacal Red Skull, leader of Hydra, an organization formerly tied to the Nazis, but now running purely under Red Skull's control.

When I first went to see 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", I was pretty psyched. I've never been a reader of the comics, but I've always been a fan of the more famous superheroes due to being a huge cartoon and film fanatic. There is a derogatory term comic fans have for such screen-based superhero fans as myself, but I can't remember it just now (for the record, I have always read comics, just not superhero ones; I would like to catch up with them someday). I've been a huge fan of the Marvel films since they started up with the X-Men, Spider-Man, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises, and things really got kicked up a notch when ""Iron Man"" came along as the first in this line of films leading up to the currently in theaters ""The Avengers"".  All 5 preceding films and The Avengers itself have been excellent to varying degrees, but ""Captain America"", in my opinion, is one of the best. This is largely due to the excellent casting, performances, retro-styling, music, and great Joe Johnston direction (this is the man who gave us The Rocketeer, another great, retro superhero film, as well as other excellent works like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which I still love to revisit on DVD). Now, when I first saw the film, I have to admit, I was more enthralled by the first two thirds than the final act. That's not to say there is anything wrong with that final act, but knowing only a limited amount about Captain America going into the film, both myself and my date expected it to be a bit more superhero-ish than it was. It was really more military offensive type stuff. Totally appropriate and well done, but for us, who are not war movie types, the story of Steve Rogers' transformation into Captain America and the relationships he makes were more fascinating. Rewatching the film more thoroughly on Blu-Ray, however, without being partially focused on how much my date was enjoying the film, ha, I find the later portion of the film much more engaging than I originally thought, and the whole thing is just a masterfully done piece of entertainment. Again, though my knowledge about the characters is limited, they seem wonderfully translated to the big screen. Nothing hokey looking about Red Skull at all, and Hugo Weaving is fantastic in the role! Chris Evans in the lead could not be better, either, and the special affects used to make him appear puny in the first part of the film are just amazing (they look much better in 2D than in 3D, as I remember seeing it on the big screen). Hayley Atwell does a wonderful job as Cap's love interest and military superior, Peggy Carter, and  it's great to see Tommy Lee Jones in the Marvel cast of characters here too, playing a hard (on the outside) Colonel as perfectly as you'd expect him to. There are plenty of other noteworthy cast members (always enjoy Toby Jones in films, and Stanley Tucci as well, he brings so much to this film), but it really is enough to say that everyone is excellent (and one of those Captain America chorus girls always catches my eye, but I won't take the space to try to specify which one).

""Captain America"" is a fantastic film, particularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly. Most of the Avengers-fueling films have done a great job with that, and I hope D.C. takes a lesson from this and starts working towards a proper Justice League film (though I have great concern, as they have yet to prove they can get the balance just right, no matter how awesome the Nolan Bat films are). Oh, and on the subject, I just love how all these films have been tied together (who hasn't loved that?), with S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Stark Enterprises (Dominic Cooper is a hoot in this as a young Howard Stark, Iron Man's dad),  and Phil Coulson popping up everywhere. The Blu-Ray is a must have if you are a Marvel fan or even just a fan of Word War II era films. It is brilliant in both respects. The movie looks and sounds great, and it comes with a fine set of bonus features: The best of the Marvel One-Shot short films (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer), a collection of featurettes and trailers, some deleted scenes, and a commentary by Director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson, and Editor Jeffrey Ford. The commentary is not the most fascinating one I've heard, but still good, and the featurettes are great as behind the scenes material. If you were a fan of ""The Avengers"" and plan to buy it when it comes out, you need to own this one too, and I certainly hope you've seen it by now. Don't forget to pick up Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk as well! That's the Edward Norton ""Incredible Hulk"", not the Eric Bana ""Hulk"", though I still say Bana's is a good film too, even if it's not AS good.

PS: As a bit of extra, interesting info I just looked into, aside from animated works, Captain America has been onscreen in two 1979 TV movies (now on DVD), and on the big screen in a 1944 serial and a 1990 film not released in the States except on VHS. It seems the general consensus is that none of these are very good, though I still wanna see them and would love to own the serial if they'd ever release it. Anyway, thankfully, we now have a truly great Captain America film in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", not to mention ""The Avengers"", and ""Captain America 2"" is scheduled for 2014.",1338508800,,6313,4.602131438721137

4698171,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America stands as one of the most recognizable super heroes to come out of the golden age of comics. His red, white, and blue outfit has stood the test of decades, and his origin story is perhaps the most American of all superheroes ever conceived. Cap is also one if the primary members of the Avengers, which is the current destination of the Marvel movies, so it should surprise no one that the Captain America movie has a lot riding on its shoulders.

So, how has the Super Soldier withstood the translation to the silver screen?

In a word, well. Captain America: The First Avenger stays true not only to the origin of the character, but it also preserves the very distinct retro-futurist aesthetics and tongue-in-cheek humor of the golden age comics with remarkable accuracy. The use of Cap as a USO propaganda piece perfectly lampoons the whole star-spangled get-up and lets us get the Hitler-punching action long-time Cap readers were hoping for, and, for the attentive viewer, there are references to all levels of the Marvel universe throughout.

Howard Stark, who plays a surprisingly large role in the movie, is the driving forced behind Cap's development into a proper superhero. He provides Rogers with the iconic round shield as well as the newly-designed suit. I'm not sure how I feel about the suit itself, but I like the helmet. It looks more high-tech than the classic dragon-scale armor that Captain America has worn for the last few decades, and a little less form fitting. It's angular, stiff, perhaps, and the colors are subdued, but it is unashamedly and undoubtedly Captain America. I think I like it, but from what's been shown of up-coming Avengers movie, the suit has actually changed substantially, so don't get used to it.

I've noticed that there is a certain big-screen quality to the movie that is somewhat lost on my home TV. Steve Roger's wild sprint through 1940's Brooklyn as he chases a Nazi infiltrator, for example, seems much less thrilling than it did when I saw a super-sized Rogers charging down the street at the theater. This is also true of the USO propaganda pieces that have Cap dancing on stage, posing for baby photos, and reciting lines taped to the back of his original shield. On a smaller screen, the larger-than-life presentation is woefully reduced.

Cap's origin is handled pretty well, though it does take up a good third of the movie. Within the Marvel Universe, there is often a certain blending of magic and science that makes the characters work. For example, the super soldier serum, in conjunction with the `vita-rays' ""Amplifies what's inside,"" meaning that the patriotic, humble Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, while the self-obsessed, power hungry Johann Schmidt becomes the Red Skull. Likewise, the Cosmic Cube, which serves as the catalyst of the story, has ties to Norse mythology, and thus to the character of Thor, who was also the star of a Marvel movie released earlier this year (to somewhat less critical and commercial success). These ties will hopefully lead to something more interesting in the Avengers movie, but we'll have to wait until next year to find out.

I'm happy to report that the handling of the magic-science that drives the movie is tastefully done. It could easily have been awkward or confusing (as was the case in Thor), but the writers and actors present it as it is, and don't try to ham it up. When it doesn't make sense, the writers move on (as is the case with the ""vibranium-alloy"" shield), and that helps a lot in maintaining verisimilitude. The writers of Iron Man 2 might have learned something from The First Avenger's handling of silly pseudo-science.

Speaking of the actors, those who rolled their eyes when Chris Evans (who was also the Human Torch in the ill-fated Fantastic Four movies) was selected to play the role. Despite his critics, Evans steals the show. Even as the skinny, gawky CG Steve Rogers, Evans is believable, and his enthusiasm for ""doing his part"" by joining the military is believable and inspiring. As the filled-out Super Soldier, he is funny, charming, and even romantic, but never over-the top. With a character that wears a flag to work, it might have been easy to fall into the camp, but Evans avoids both the too-dark tone of many of the recent superhero flicks and the campy, ho-hum of the old-school superhero movies. It has more in common with the first Spider Man movie than it does with most of the others released in the last year or two.

The Red Skull, played by Hugo Weaving, does not translate so well to the silver screen, if only because he gets so little screen time. When he is allowed to show his face, it seems he can only threaten or bark evil things; we never really get a grasp for how evil he really is, and because of some story compression towards the end of the second act, first-time viewers may not even understand the Red Skull's actual mission with Hydra (who are, I'm sad to report, definitely over the top). The compression also turns what would have been really fun middle act starring Cap and the Howling Commandos is turned into what is essentially a montage... That was pretty disappointing.

Despite my complaints, Weaving's casting as the Skull isn't bad at all. Indeed, he is quite creepy and intense, and his drawling German accent is enough to send chills up my spine, but the role was limited, perhaps out of necessity, because, well, this is a prequel.

That, perhaps more than anything, is what holds this movie back from being really breath-taking. Despite awesome sets, incredible costume design, and all-around solid writing and acting, we can't help but invest ourselves in The First Avenger as anything more than a prelude. Everything feels like, and is, a set-up, from Cap's arctic plunge, the Cosmic Cube, Howard Stark, and even the super soldier serum itself.

I'm hoping with my fingers crossed that it will be a hell of a payoff. Certain characters are left with uncertain fates, and that, I'm hoping, will make for some very interesting movies in the next few years. For now I'm happy with Captain America, even after a third viewing. It is a good solid superhero movie that bucks the modern-day trend of broody superfolks, and tells a well-rounded, brilliantly-acted story that has gunfights, Nazis, romance, car chases, and a surprisingly good sense of humor.

Here's hoping The Avengers can follow Cap's charge.",1337990400,10,6420,4.8369763205828775

4698176,3,B005GYJPYW,"I was on the fence with this film the first time I saw it, but I liked it a bit more the second time around.  I appreciated the performances, humor and character development more, and after seeing ""The Avengers"" and then re-watching this film I had more appreciation for the tie-in with that blockbuster.  It also tied in nicely with the ""Iron Man"" films (don't want to say how or that might spoil it for some).  However, the pace of this film was a bit on the slow side for my taste, and I didn't really care for Steve Rogers' merry band of soldiers or Red Skull.  (The same type of serum that turned Rogers into a super soldier turned another guy's head red and made his nose fall off? What's up with that?)

The visual effects used to reduce Chris Evans from his usual pumped up, muscular self to a 90-lb. weakling were amazing, and the effects were good throughout most of the film.  However, there were a couple of scenes where I thought the effects still needed some work, like the flying wing and few moments that looked like the actors were standing in front of green screens.

Anyway, there were some funny moments and good action scenes, and the HD and 7.1 presentation was great.  The 3D effects were disappointing though.  This wasn't really a surprise given the fact that the movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D in post production.  The titles and main menu utilized the 3D gimmick well, but not much else.

One question remains though: why does Captain America bother to wear a cowl when the world knows his identity? Seems pointless, and his costume looks better without it.",1337385600,,1596,4.506944444444445

4698178,4,B005GYJPYW,"Colorful, nostalgic and splendidly executed on many fronts, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER ranks with the most satisfying comic-book movies to date.

Joe Johnston, who did such a fine job helming Disney's underrated WWII-period genre film ""The Rocketeer"" some 20 years ago, was the right choice to bring Marvel's patriotic hero to the screen in a confident, satisfying film that hits every note from its first frame to nearly its last.

Chris Evans makes for a perfect Steve Rogers, the tough kid from Brooklyn whose motivation and courage are unfortunately not matched by his scrawny, weak body - one that prevents him from serving Uncle Sam in WWII. Rogers is continually rejected for service until his determination is noted by scientist Stanley Tucci, working for the U.S. military and who sees in Rogers the perfect candidate for their new Super Soldier program, spearheaded in part by brilliant Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing none other than Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark's father).

Rogers' transformation, though, at first applies mostly off the field of battle, with Captain America serving as a USO salesman for war bonds (there's a wonderful musical montage set to an original Alan Menken-David Zippel song). Much to the consternation of gruff colonel Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers eventually presses his way into service, saving an Allied troop from certain death at the hands of HYDRA, a Nazi off-shoot presided over by the evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt has not only been previously transformed by Tucci's doctor into the vile Red Skull, but has also corralled one of Odin's energy cubes and created a new destructive weapon that threatens the future of the entire world.

""Captain America"" does dial down the particulars of its war-time setting so as to not feel like too much of an ""all-American"" story, replacing any overt feelings of rah-rah patriotism with an overriding message that Rogers is a hero not because of his nationality so much as his courage and heart instead (as he tells Tucci's scientist at the beginning, Cap ""doesn't want to kill anyone"" but can't stand ""bullies""). It's a decision that ultimately works, managing to make the picture more appealing to foreign markets while not turning the material into a completely toothless, ""Politically Corrected"" portrayal of the character either (a gambit that paid off with the movie having grossed $365 million worldwide, slightly more than half overseas).

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script confidently profiles Cap's dogged pursuit of the Skull with just a hint of romance (British newcomer Hayley Atwell is fetching as Peggy Carter), though supporting roles for the likes of Sebastian Stan (as Cap's sidekick Bucky) and Neal McDonough (one of the ""Howling Commandos"") come off as if they've been reduced in the editing room. Johnston's fondness for the material, though, is always evident, marked by crisply-edited action scenes that bring the vintage Marvel comics to life. Technically the movie is graced by an occasionally rousing Alan Silvestri score (his end credits ""March"" is just great) and cinematography by Shelly Johnson that was done no favors by the movie's 3-D exhibitions, which darkened an already limited visual pallet that overly accentuated green-screen.

If there's one disappointment with ""Captain America,"" it's that the film works so well, it's a letdown when the material moves into the present day for its inevitable ""Avengers"" set-up in its concluding moments - making one surmise that if there is a sequel, it's not going to involve the period setting and supporting characters from this exciting ""Cap"" to the year's super-hero efforts. (Perhaps some kind of time-travel device can send Steve back to the `40s?)

Paramount brings ""Captain America"" to Blu-Ray and 3-D Blu-Ray this week in a number of different variants, including a limited-edition three-disc bundle. The 3-D for the movie is well-handled for the most part with depth-of-field effects, yet as I mentioned before, the cinematography is dulled even further from its standard appearance so I would recommend the 2-D version instead. The DTS MA soundtrack is dynamic throughout.

Extras include five minutes of deleted scenes in HD with incomplete special effects that fans will find of interest, including a different introduction to the Howling Commandos and a longer ending. Seven Making Of featurettes give a slick, mostly promotional-type look behind the scenes while there's another brief, amusing ""Marvel One Shot"" with Special Agent Caulson (Clark Gregg) set in between this picture and ""Thor.""

4698179,2,B005GYJPYW,"We need about 1,000,000 reviews of this product to point out that the 3D was ""created"" in post production.  That conversion is very disappointing.

An improvement over the 1990 monstrosity, Evans was fantastic and Hugo was born to play RedSkull. The film is an action packed extravaganza that is quite true to the original Marvel comics of the 40s and 60s, i like how they used amazing digital make-up in the Benjamin Button tradition on Evan's character to make him a weakling which looked almost real and how Hugo's make-up was.

The Hype: Many were wondering whether Chris Evans could pull of being Captain America. I would say he did an honorable job. His acting was timely, felt natural, and had some humor in the mix. He is also perfect in terms of his body (very ripped I may add). His body and delivery certainly fit the bill as Captain America. It doesn't hurt that he is handsome as well. He commands stage presence and has a solid performance. He has a few superb acting moments.

The cast: A well rounded cast with some new actors/actresses in the mix. I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as the Colonel, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. Generally, most of the cast and supporting actors were solid. Soldiers casted all did a wonderful job in creating a believable atmosphere, while also blending some humor. Humor is always welcomed in action movies.

My experience: The backdrop and character development of Steve Rogers (Captain America) was entertaining and timed just right. It did not feel dragged nor too short. The movie explores Steve as a puny, short, weak individual whom gets chosen to become an chemically enhanced soldier, because of his intelligence, courage, and humility. As he progressed, we are treated with a musical segment, highlighting Rogers' career as Captain America, as a performer. Moving forward, Rogers had enough of the performing career and wanted to help win the war and against Red Skull. The action was solid. Love starts to build between Captain and Peggy Carter. Though it's just a side story, it's still refreshing to see their chemistry on screen. It will be interesting to see if Captain has any internal conflicts (not being able to see Peggy again) in future Captain America installments.

4698188,4,B005GYJPYW,"The Sentinel of Liberty did not come crashing to the big screen but came carefully, crafted in such a way as to hopefully maximize his potential earnings not just within North American markets but also across the world.  Downplayed was overt patriotism (consider that the America he inhabited, as the moviegoer is shown, was rife with failure: Stark's hovering expo car that faltered; the infiltration of the laboratory and death of Steve Roger's mentor/ creator, Dr. Erskine; Cap's initial sidelining by way of buffoonish salesman) and played up was the comic and the cartoonish.  It was probably a good choice and the story flowed and was well handled.  Opting to keep our flag-figured hero in his patriotic colors was as far as Marvel seemed to want to push this but their ways of finding nods to his history were very satisfying (see: Cap's initial ""buffoonish"" salesman costume complete with unwieldy, pointed shield).  The humor was well-played and gratifying (Stark's hovering car that work and his quips that did; the off-set, griseled Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) being satisfyling wrong about his thoughts of who should rise to the head of the super-soldier pack; Peggy Carter, feeling jealous, firing at Cap's new shield) and The Red Skull was a capable menace, an anti-Captain America if you will, but he wasn't too capable.  I liked very much that he was a failed test of Erskine's and Hugo Weaving played him with a calculated accent.  Chris Evans did a more than fine job, so much so that I accepted him rather quickly and completely forgot that he was ever the Human Torch (played a fantastic Torch BTW)!  Evans actually showed off some acting chops, playing with humor and awkwardness and appropriate pathos.  Where I think Marvel missed the mark was in not having a face-to-face with Hitler, with not focusing (even a little bit) on the horrors of WWII.  This would have grounded the film (a la X-men: First Class) and given it more emotional weight.  But it's still a fun ride and a very good superhero movie without it.  Upon first viewing I thought that the Red Skull was played as a fairly weak villain (he was compared to the comics) but on my second viewing his screen presence and effect was very much close to right (he certainly wasn't a non-event like first Fantastic Four's Doctor Doom).  Overall a gratifying comic book movie experience.

One more thing: for those of you who have passed on the extra features I encourage you to check out how they ""made"" Captain America/ Steve Rogers.  I thought that they just used another actor the entire time and transposed Evans' face (which they did part of the time) but for parts of it it is all Evans, slimmed down and smoothed away by a computer.  Simply amazing.",1335916800,2,2743,4.794055201698514
4698189,4,B005GYJPYW,"I like many was concerned when I heard Chris Evans was playing Captain America.  Images of him from 'Not Another Teen Movie' kept flooding back.  BTW, funny movie.  I was just concerned about having a funny man play the ultimate American.  Also he had already played Johnny Storm.  It was kind of weird for him to play another Marvel character.  I was further concerned when I saw he would not be blond in the movie.  FYI, Capt. America is blond in the comics.  So, going into this Marvel flick I had some worries.  I will say my worries were calmed a bit by the epic previews they kept showing before the release of the movie.  I was eventually, cautiously optomistic to say the least.

Well, this Fanboy was not disappointed.  The movie turned out GREAT, and was a solid prequel for the upcoming 'Avengers' movie.

--Story--

The story was exactly what is should be, Steve Rogers in World War II fighting Nazis.  No other story would have been right.  To only have a brief moment of him in the 1940s and then flash forward to 2011, that would have a travesty.

**Some Spoilers**

The story begins with a Nazi villian, later revealed to be the Red Skull, finding an ancient cube in an old church.  For those not familier, the cube is called the ""Cosmic Cube"" and is VERY powerful.  The Red Skull is portrayed by Hugo Weaving.  Excellant casting decision by the way.  Just the right amount of sinister and intelligence.  The cube once harnessed by the Red Skull's scientist is able to power all his advanced weaponry.  These weapons are powerful enough to definitely gurantine victory for the Axis powers.

Enter Stever Rogers, a small, sickly man who is 100 percent adamant about serving his country in the armed forces.  Kudos to the CG department for making Chris Evans look so small.  Well Steve hops from city to city hoping at least one doctor will clear him medically to serve.  So far he's been turned down every time.

Finally he comes across an army medical doctor/scientist, played perfectly by Stanley Tucci, who offers Steve the chance he's be looking for.  It turns out this doctor has perfected a ""Super Soldier Serum"" and is looking for the right candidate to try it on.  It is revealed in a flash back scene that the Red Skull looks the way he does because he tryed an early batch on himself.  Stanley Tucci's character is concerned who to try it on, as the formula only amplifies what's already in a person.  I.E. a good man becomes GREAT, and a bad man becomes a HORRIBLE monster.

Thus, after going through some basic training overseen by none other than the great Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers is selected and prepped for the procedure.  BTW, another great decision casting Tommy Lee Jones...

We at this point get another great character entry, Howard Stark.  Howard is none other than the father of Tony Stark, aka Iron-Man.  Howard is in my opinion just like Howard Hughes.  That's what the writers of the comics and this movie are going for and it shows, in a good way.  Howard is already a millionare and works on top-secret projects for the U.S. Government.  He builds the chamber Steve Rogers becomes Captain America in.  This will no doubt be a plot point in the 'Avengers' movie.  Expect Captain America to say something on the lines of ""I knew your father Tony, and your not him..."", or something like that.

Anyway, shortly after the successful procedure, a buff Chris Evans exits the chamber.  The lab is blown up and the doctor is shot by a Nazi spy.  Thus the exact formula is lost with the good doctor.  It also means that Steve Rogers, at least for the forseeable future is the only ""Super Soldier"".

It's at this point that the movie loses pace a little.  We see Captain America dancing and singing his way around America selling war bonds.  I would have much rather seen him go right into action.

Luckily this doesn't last too long.  Steve feels horrible for not fighting, and once his old pal Bucky Barnes is kidnapped he sets off on his own for a one man rescue.

The film then regains it's pace.  We get a lot of action and some pretty cool shield throwing scenes.  Howard Stark outfits Steve with a pretty cool uniform, (which looks WAY better than what he's wearing in the 'Avengers), and gives him his vibranium shield.  Captain America puts together his own rag-tag bunch of soldiers, his A-Team so to speak...and they go on some pretty high octane missions together.

Well...to move things along.  Steve loses Bucky, or so it seems...and after stopping the Red Skull's forces and the Red Skull himself, crashes the Red Skull's plane into an ice-filled ocean.  The ship would have killed a lot of people if it made it to America.  The Cosmic Cube is recovered by Howard Stark, and later seen at the end of 'Thor'.  Unfortunately Cap is not found until 2011.  This is a sad scene, as you know he will never see the woman he loved again.  He is a man out of time, with friends and loved ones long gone.

--Pros--

Great casting.  Great costume, followed the Ultimate Captain America design.  Great writing.  The scenery is truly realistic in it's appearance.  If it wouldn't be for the futuristic tanks and energy weapons that the Red Skull's forces used, you'd swear you were back in WWII.

Having us the viewer see Steve Rogers before and after his transformation is what REALLY made this film.  Again, kudos to the CG department.

This film, although it can stand on it's own, IS really a prequel to the 'Avengers' and helps to tie 'Thor' and 'Iron-Man' together, pretty well actually.

--Cons--

My only gripe was seeing Captain America singing and dancing.  Although this was not long, I did not enjoy it and think it took the character down a notch.  Why would a man so adamant about being a soldier stoop to doing this.

Only gripe though,  movie gets back on track soon afterward.  So I only docked one star.  Also I would have prefered to see Steve Rogers blond.  I can see why they choose to go with brown though.  After all the Nazi's were blond haired, blue eyed.  Still, he is blond in the comics and in the 'Ultimate Avengers' movies.  This is just a minor Fanboy gripe though...

--In Conclusion--

Stellar movie, a MUST own for any Marvel fan.  I plan on buying the BLU-RAY edition, once I finally buy a BLU-RAY player.  From what I've been reading, you get the most deleted scenes and bonus features with the BLU-RAY.

Really liked this movie and can't wait to see the 'Avengers'.  I'll see you there, I'll be the one yelling at everyone to shut their cellphones off because the movie is starting...",1335830400,2,6555,4.578947368421052

It's good action, with a good story.  It's definately worth renting or adding to your collection.",1335744000,,255,4.382978723404255
4698191,5,B005GYJPYW,"Before the movie was released, I seriously doubted that I would like it. My biggest concern was with Cap's uniform - it was Not the original. From what I had seen of the movie's version of it, the uniform looked drab and cheap. But, Joe Johnston pulled it all off, beautifully.  The story was crafted in such a way as to lock one's focus on Steve Rogers at the very outset - who HE is, and what it was about him that made him the One to be chosen for the Super Soldier project. He was the Right pick, at the Right time, for the Right reason. A world full of Captain Americas might Not be a better place, but a world full of Steve Rogers(s) would definately be an improvement.....

From the gate, the look of Cap's uniform became less of a concen. In fact, in the context of the film - and the era in which it took place - the look actually worked, for me - somewhat. However, my only complaint about the movie was the way the facsimile of the original was used. I'm an 'old school' kind of guy, and I found that whole scenario to be rather insulting to the memory of the Captain America who I grew up on (I still think that they could effectively used the original uniform with the chain mail armor). Although this part make me squirm, it did not keep this movie from being an outstanding production.

Chris Evans' performance was right on the money - he nailed the `Character' of Steve Rogers. I can't even think of him as the Human Torch, anymore. He handled his business, extremely well.

Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull....whoa! He was the perfect choice for the role, and I can't think of any words that would do him justice.

Tommy Lee Jones - a WW2 colonel?....of course!

Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes.....I liked it.  He did a great job. Although I am a fan of classic depictions of characters, I liked the portrayal of Bucky in the movie. A kid sidekick would not have fit the tone of the movie. Stan wore the only uniform that Bucky needed.

Hayley Atwell was a great choice as Peggy Carter. She was tough, yet very much a lady - and you could see puny Steve Rogers melting her heart away. Seeing her dressed in 1940s styles reminds me why I would prefer to see ALL women dressed in those styles.

I could go on and on...

This movie is, in my opinion, the very BEST of all the Marvel movies. In fact, this is the most satisfying of ALL the super hero movies that I've seen. To me, it is waaayyy much better than The Dark Knight (not a particular favorite of mine - I liked Batman Begins much, much more). Joe Johnston is especially gifted in evoking the 1930s (see The Rocketeer - another great film)and 1940s eras. He knocked This one waaayy out of the park. Captain America The First Avenger is a grand and epic story that also pulls at one's heart - the ending left a lump in my throat.

This movie is grand entertainment on all levels, and I highly recommend it.

I've been fooled before, but I can't see The Avengers - or any other super hero movie - being a better movie than Captain America The First Avenger.",1335744000,,3027,4.281961471103328
4698192,1,B005GYJPYW,"The story was good, but the main actor (Chris Evans) was like a cardboard cut out. He was really boring and there was never a sparkle in his eye. He looked like a Ken doll that acted plastic. Boring, no charisma.",1335744000,5,212,4.195121951219512
4698193,3,B005GYJPYW,"Norway, 1942. A Nazi special weapons division commanded by Johann Schmidt secures an ancient artifact of unknown origin but incredible power, which they hope to use to power a new, more advanced war machine. At the same time, in New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected from joining the US Army due to a significant number of health issues. Frustrated, he tries to falsify documents in order to enlist. Impressed by his tenacity, Dr. Abraham Erskine instead recruits him for a top-secret programme, designed to create the ultimate soldier using technology. Rogers becomes Captain America, just as Schmidt (adopting the alias, 'the Red Skull') breaks away from his Nazi masters to undertake his own mission of destruction and world domination.

Captain America: The First Avenger is yet another piece in Marvel's 'cinematic masterplan', of tying together different characters into a single coherent universe. This plan - which also incorporates Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the two Iron Man movies - culminates in The Avengers, which recently hit cinemas. With Captain America, Marvel resist the urge to bring the character immediately into the present, instead giving him a full origin story set in WWII. This sets the film apart from its contemporaries and allows Rogers' patriotism to be established in full at a time of good vs. evil before bringing him into the murkier present.

The film is anchored on Chris Evans's performance as Rogers/Captain America (Evans previously played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies), which is decent. A problem with the Captain America character is that unabashed American patriotism isn't a concept that travels well abroad. However, taking a nod from the comics where the same issue has come up a few times over the years, Evans plays the character as a good man who wants to do his part and isn't a blind follower of American policy. Later in the film the character becomes based in London and leads an international team of agents in taking the fight to the Red Skull, mixing things up in a more interesting manner. A combination of Evans's performance and impressive CGI also totally sells the illusion of the puny, short and unhealthy Rogers in the opening sequences of the film before his transformation into the buff Captain America.

Other performances are good, with director Joe Johnston opting for safe and reliable actors in many of the roles: Tommy Lee Jones plays a brash US general who gets the best lines in the movie (as may be expected), with Stanley Tucci bringing eccentricity and humanity to the role of Erskine. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull and Toby Jones as his sidekick Dr. Zola also form a solid double-act (though Weaving occasionally slips into 'auto-pilot evil', this being a role he could do in is sleep). Hayley Atwell provides solid support as British agent Peggy Carter. The potential for saying something interesting as a British female agent working alongside square-jawed American soldiers in wartime is squandered, however, with Carter characterised as a 'plucky British gal' and not developed much further beyond punching out a solider who makes a sexist comment before she falls for the hero. The ever-reliable Neal McDonough also appears as one of Rogers's international team of agents, though aside from a truly outrageous moustache he is not very distinguishable from the very similar roles he's played before on Band of Brothers and Minority Report.

The film adopts a cool retrofuturistic (or 'Americanapunk') tone at times, with Johnston clearly tapping the same well as his entertaining early-career picture, The Rocketeer. There's a playful sense of humour at times, and Captain America deserves some plaudits for being the first contemporary superhero movie to transform into a musical for ten minutes halfway through (rationalised in the storyline). However, its musings on patriotism, warfare and heroism rarely rise above the predictable. The plot is pretty straightforward, although well-paced with some good action sequences. The links to the rest of the Marvel cinematic universe are downplayed to a few appearances by Tony Stark's father and the now-traditional appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the movie's closing moments (interestingly, in the actual finale of the movie rather than a post-credits sequence). This allows the movie to stand alone as an independent piece of entertainment.

The film's biggest problem is a total lack of surprise or tension. It's a solidly-made piece of entertainment which relies on its period setting as its sole distinguishing feature from its contemporaries. The actors and director all do good work and it certainly passes the time enjoyably enough, but it lacks long-term appeal.

I did not know what to expect from this one at all. I vaguely knew Captain America's origins, but he's never been a superhero that caught my interest. I fell in love with the character over the course of the film. Steve Rogers is simply a good person who goes out and does the right thing, even if it means great risk to himself. It's hard not to rally around a character like that.

Plus, it's a fun film.  The bad guy (Red Skull) is over the top.  Captain America's team, the Howling Commandos, are a diverse group of competent soldiers and wisecrackers.  You can see Tony Stark in Dominic Cooper's performance as Howard Stark.  Peggy is a brilliant character: focused, intelligent, and getting the job done.

4698219,5,B005GYJPYW,"For a long time now, Captain America has been my favorite Marvel comics character. He's just awesome. He's been a little on the dark side, particularly during the 80's, when it was required that EVERY superhero comic went through a dark phase, and with some of the recent Brubaker era work, Steve Rogers has seen some serious stuff go down. What Joe Johnston did with this film, and how it not only differentiates itself from all of the other Marvel films (not just the Marvel Studios films, but all films based on Marvel characters), but also how well it works, is how unapologetically sincere and earnest it is.

Without exception, all of the other Marvel-based films have had their fill of post-modern cynicism and self-referential humor, and I'm not really knocking it. For the most part, it's suited the films well, particularly X2 and SPIDER-MAN 2. But this is a film set in the 1940's, and it's about a young man who believes so much in the ideals of his country and who so badly wants to make a difference, he's willing to put his own life on the line to potentially change it.

Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss ""God"" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either. There is great fun to be had with this film, and you gotta love the little RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK references in it. Also the cast in and of itself is quite good, particularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine. I honestly get choked up in the scene Erskine and Rogers share in the barracks the night before the experiment. It's my favorite scene of the film, because it gives you time to connect with the characters on an emotional level without any flash or gimmicks.

The story was weak, there wasn't any connection between any of his team and none of the characters had any depth to them.  The ""love interest"" if you can call her that, was barely there, and they never even had a date.  Really great love story - check that off the list.  Action - too, much, too long, too dull.  All CGI effects that were dull!  Check.  Acting - eh.  I love Tommy Lee Jones but he was all, gruff and nothing else. They didn't give him enough to do with this part.

You couldn't care about Captain America because he wasn't more than cardboard, the Red headed villan was the same - idiotic.  Writing - terrible!!  I don't give a damn about the comics; you can't have a, what 5 hour movie - sorry felt like it - 2 hour movie where one of the most interesting characters, the German Scientist gets killed, his best friend dies because of him, and Capt. America crashes in the ice and then he wakes up 70 years later. Everyone you know and loved is dead.  The End.  Huh???

I mean, I love Nick Fury, Tony Stark in Ironman & Thor as much as anyone, more probably than most women, and I can't wait for the Avengers movie, but really???  I kept thinking the movie was over, mercifully, then it started up again attacking another facility, having more unnecessary fight/action scenes.  Editing - cut about half of the stuff out.

Overall rating - less than 0 if I could rate it that.  Avoid this one and rewatch Ironman 1 & 2, Thor and wait of the Avengers, which I hope will rock!",1332028800,5,1756,4.24773413897281

The best part of this movie, hands down, is Steve Rodgers BEFORE the vita-ray treatment.

Consider the 90-pound asthmatic Steve Rodgers. He is persistent. He wishes to honor the life and death of his father. And he understands appropriate deception. This is understandable and forgivable, considering his chicken-little body, and his lion's heart. These are all heroic qualities.

Then consider two of the three tests he passes before the vita-ray/super soldier serum treatment. The first is intelligence. He solves the flag-pole problem and gets the girl. Rodgers is not ""scientific smart"" like Reed Richards (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B000I9U8NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>) or Howard and Tony Stark (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man-2-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B003UYV08E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)</a>). But he is shrewd, wily, and clever, like Samson (the riddles in Judges 14) and Hercules (the Twelve Labors were tests of brains as well as brawn). And he needed to pass ""the brains"" test before he became the New Hercules for the New World.

The second test clinched the deal. Our 90-pound weakling was the first on the hand grenade. ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13). And his self-sacrifice was so instinctive! No thought, no doubt, no ""refusal of the call,"" just quick action in the right direction.

The last test was the one Samson failed, the test of chastity in the face of a buxom vixen. Forget Camelot's ""Fie on Goodness,"" this is vintage Tennyson: ""My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure."" (Galahad).

And I applaud  Marvel for both understanding their own property and also understanding the nature of heroism. Considering the abomination (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001LM1456/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk</a>) (pun intended) that have been many of the previous hero movies (they still can't get the Punisher right, nor Galactus for that matter), this one was a shot in the arm. And a vita-ray treatment, too.

4698225,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie tells the origins of Cap, and does it extremely well. Chris Evans is very believeable as Steve Rogers, both before the transformation of the expirment. And after, And Hugo Weaving as Red Skull. Wooooooooooow, people have complained that this movie was empty. And lacked substance and style, for a movie set during WWII. Question for you, would it really be appropiate to have modern day explosions, which there were plenty of. The director handled Cap with class and dignity, surprisingly following the comics. After he becomes a supersoldier, because the doctor is killed by a Nazi spy. The formula is lost, leaving Rogers to be the only Super Soldier. So the army uses him as a propaganda tool, a nod to what both D.C. Comics, and Marvel comics did during WWII. Using their characters to sell war bonds, Rogers gets tired of this. And goes off on his own, to rescue a squadron. Including his friend, my only problem with this movie. Is that they kill Bucky, but the movie actually makes up for it. For those who didn't like this movie, must have liked the 1990 movie, where Captain America is portrayed as a buffoon. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO RESCUE HIM FROM RED SKULL, but I digress. A dignified presentation of a classic comic book character, which is more than I can say for the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. Or the Dark Knight, this is how you handle a Comic book character.

-underdog American GIs ready to give them what for...
-personal transformations, explosions, hints of romance...

4698237,4,B005GYJPYW,"This was an amazing movie. There was never a moment where I found myself bored. At one point, my wife decided to pause the movie to take a break and I found myself upset. It was that good.

I'm not a Captain America fan. Of all the Marvel heroes, I thought he was too cheesy. Yet, this movie was exceptional at modernizing a war set in the 40s. The comedy was appealing, not as corny as I imagined it would be. The romantic interest wasn't overdone--I actually wanted to see more of it. And the action was right where it needed to be.

My only hangup, the end. The original reason I didn't want to see this movie was because I knew they were rushing all of the Marvel hero movies to make the Avengers. The Avengers' trailer looked so great that I thought I should give this a shot. It was worth it, but and this is a big but, it was in fact rushed. The ending just didn't seem there for me.

I'm somewhat of a Wolverine fan and I definitely expected to see a quick shot or at least a mention of his name. Nothing.

So maybe he'll show up in Part 2? No. Spoiler alert: Good ole Cap will end up in the future. Why? Stupidest thing ever, he had to crash the plane. For what? It made absolutely no sense. He could turn the nose of the plane down, but couldn't turn it around or make a safe landing. The ending was almost enough to spoil the movie, but I won't judge the entire thing off the last few minutes.

4698241,5,B005GYJPYW,"I'll cop to being a little underwhelmed by Thor, and since Captain America was the next Avengers film, I was more than a little worried. Thankfully this concern turned out to be baseless, as Joe Johnston delivers the same bouncing retro panache here that he used to such brilliant effect in The Rocketeer. Cap is a film of moments- Hugo Weaving's Red Skull frantically working a huge bank of controls to fry his superiors with a ray gun, Chris Evans bombing his USO routine to a camp of war-weary soldiers, and a dozen other instants of cinematic brilliance are icing dollops on a very sweet cake.

One feels honestly that this is the kind of movie they would have made about Captain America in the 40s if they could have. And while it contains innumerable little tidbits to appeal to Avengers followers and comic fans in general, it remains accessible to the casual moviegoer as well. If I had one complaint about this film it would be that there are really too many characters and too much plot for just one film- Cap deserved two movies just like Iron man, and I hope that down the line, he'll get them.

With this set you get the movie on BD and DVD, so you can take it to your mom's house where they haven't updated their home theater in eleven years. Extras are pretty sparse and consist mostly of little promotional tidbits that were already available online- it's my theory that all the really juicy bonus content is being saved for some kind of boxed set after Avengers comes out. The movie itself is a lovingly faithful transfer that will not disappoint anyone, but probably won't blow you away either- this is a very straightforward film without a lot of hidden details or secrets. Still, a lot of work went into these sets and digital backlots, so best to see it all, eh? Audio is appropriately bombastic (I love me some Silvestri) but like the Iron Man films, the music is rather loud in proportion to the voices- no problem if you watch it LOUD.",1329523200,,1959,4.531073446327683

Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)...

4698247,4,B005GYJPYW,"So I finally got round to watching the last of my superhero movies from last year (I refuse to acknowledge Green Lantern). The short version is I really enjoyed it.

It's not dark and gritty a la Batman which may disappoint some I suppose. Nor does it have the sheer joy that the first Iron Man offered. What it is, is solid and adding some of the war movie trappings onto a superhero story was a refreshing change.

As befits the character of Captain America/Steve Rogers (effectively captured by Chris Evans) there wasn't much in the way of self doubt or shades of grey. Cap does what he does because he believes it is the right thing to do. Plain and simple.

The supporting cast was good too. Hugo Weaving gave us the over the top two dimensional Red Skull that that particular character demands and Tommy Lee Jones was... well Tommy Lee Jones.

My biggest criticism is that the material was a little rushed. There were at least two movies to be had out of this story, but the need to get Cap frozen in ice and ready for the Avengers film made for a very rushed last few minutes.

4698253,5,B005GYJPYW,"**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 7/27/11**

Growing up, I was a huge Marvel Comics guy. Like many comic geeks, my battle line was well and truly defined. It was Marvel all the way... no DC (except Batman... sometimes). And even though I'm ""grown up"" now, I still anticipate each Marvel movie release with great excitement. After all, throughout the past few years, they've had a pretty dynamite track record.

And they've done it again. Despite loving (and knowing every little aspect about) the Marvel Universe as a kid, Captain America was never one of my favorite characters. That being said, they've just made the perfect Captain America movie. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, but I can't imagine anything better being fashioned from this character's story. It easily ties X-Men: First Class as my favorite comic book movie of the summer.

The film works so well for so many different reasons. For one, it has an ultra appealing lead actor and a main character with equal parts heart, humor and symbolism. It also features a charismatic (and truly badass) villain in the Red Skull (played by the always reliable Hugo Weaving). This was one of my main quibbles with Thor earlier this year, and definitely Green Lantern last month. A hero's only as good as its villain. Bonus points for the make-up job. Very, very cool.

Best of all, the movie's old-fashioned in the best possible way. True, the vast majority of the story takes place in the 1940's (and the parts that don't are pretty dang awesome), but like X-Men was, this is a heavily stylized setting, amping up reality to create a comic-book vibe that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet honors the story's roots at the same time. Most tellingly, the story itself has a good old-fashioned feel to it. The inevitable crash boom bang parts are there, but they're sandwiched within a story with characters you actually care about. One of my fears going into the theater was that this was going to turn out to be a boring trudge through history. Not so. I had an absolute blast. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie ups Captain America tenfold in the superhero pop culture pantheon. He's like Superman, but relatable.

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 60 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Many of them are quick but easily noticeable. An additional 5 effects made it to 20% or more.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
The cardboard cutout syndrome is glaringly noticeable early in the movie and in A FEW other scenes throughout the film with only 1, 2 or 3 depths and a flat background. The balance of the scenes converted well and only appeared slightly shallower in depth than normal and the syndrome was negligible.

If you like action type films, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of a (fake 3D) conversion and enjoy this movie for what it is. The 3D definitely adds to the viewing experience of this film.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
In addition to the menu; Crosstalk was evident 6 times but only 1 of them was a major eyesore.
(crosstalk varies from system to system)

MY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

It was that year that I came across some moldy, badly withered copies of the original Golden Age Captain America comic books. The colorful costume, bizarre villains and intriguing cross between horror comics (ahead of its time in that respect) and an old fashioned heroic archetype was irresistible. I gathered them up and took them home, but never got the chance to actually read all of them as they were immediately discovered by my Mom (how do they do that?) and thrown out into the trash. While my exposure was fleeting, it was indelible. When I saw the uniform on the cover of The Avengers #4 I snatched it out of the rack and rushed home, reading the book every step of the way and repeating that read over and over for days. He was back, that mythical uniform bursting straight off the cover and into my age of the comic book. The Silver Age was finally going big time for me. This was a hero I could not resist, much like Spider-man, because the overarching theme was an intriguing mixture of dedication and doubt. Steve Rogers is a man out of his time, everything and everyone he loved either gone or changed so drastically as to be unrecognizable. He awakens in the world of today, having been buried in a sheet of ice since the waning days of WWII having met his apparent death along with his partner Bucky while on a mission. That is where the modern day mythos of Captain Americas' begins. But the back story, his origin, his ascendency to national icon and his epic confrontation with his opposite, The Red Skull is the story of this movie. It is told well with a great feel for the period combined with wonderful details from the Golden Age Marvel (Timely) universe. It is suitable for a wide audience range, the story is broad enough that the viewer does not have to be a fanboy to follow the plot and has enough insider touches and threads to delight the real fanboys. Captain America has some great effects, some very thrilling action scenes all tied together with a healthy dose of excellent acting. As a set up for the upcoming The Avengers it does not make a wrong move and it will certainly be followed by at least two more sequels. If the quality of this first effort is carried through the sequels, Cap fans are in for a real treat",1326931200,,2332,4.438228438228438

""Captain America""  (2011)
-----------------------------------------------------
Note: spoilers below
-----------------------------------------------------

This ""Captain America"" film has been hailed as the best-est comicbook movie ever: I would say that it's certainly in the top five, and it's pretty good, though there is room to nitpick. It tells the story of Captain America's origin well and telescopes his WWII career into what looks like one big adventure.  This last detail is problematic for me: although there is an action montage which suggests other adventures that could be set in the 1940s, for some reason they bend the original boyscout origin into a scenario that has Steve (Captain America) Rogers sidelined from the action doing USO tours and war bond shows instead of cracking heads on the front lines: he has to prove himself to his cranky, old-school commanding officer Tommy Lee Jones first. Which is fine, except they also have as the climax of the film the semi-death of Captain America: one big battle and then he's literally frozen on ice until thawing out decades later. So... then how does he become the iconic WWII legend that all other Marvel heroes live in awe of??

Once again, Hollywood undercuts its own superhero franchise by cramming too much into one movie. They could've skipped the neutered-hero subplot, then shown glimpses of numerous other battles and *then* had his big showdown with the Red Skull, but oh no, that would have been too much like the comicbooks. Oh, and did I mention that they also (apparently) killed off the Red Skull as well? I'm guessing he comes back via magic, but they made it look like he burned to a crisp? Why? Why ""kill"" the hero's arch-nemesis in the first film? Why does Hollywood keep doing this? It's unnecessary and it damages the long-term prospects for building a series of movies around the hero. And why grind your way through so many plot points?  Give the story room to breathe, and the franchise room to grow - don't burn so many bridges right away.

To be fair, this ""Captain America"" is much better in this regard than other super-movies and is generally quite enjoyable. I liked the depiction of the silly super-baddies in the Hydra secret army (even though there wound up being too much anachronistic high-tech weaponry in this World War II origin movie) and I thought the prologue where Cap got his powers was well-handled.  I'd like a little retconning of the retcon so that maybe we could have more WWII adventures, maybe even a little Invaders action with the Sub-Mariner and the original Human Torch (who is glimpsed briefly in this film...) Also, it would be nice to see Cap in his bright, primary-colors superhero outfit.  What's the point of wearing the old Red, White & Blue if its buried under layers of parachute straps, canteens and khaki canvas rucksacks? WTF? I know Marvel currently loves the strapped-up Captain America look, but I doubt many fans share their enthusiasm. Let's see him all bright and cartoony! Why wear the flag if you don't let it fly?

Anyway, I thought this was pretty good, all thing considered. Make Mine Marvel!  (Axton)",1326585600,,3201,5.056925996204933

They handled it beautifully with just the right touches to make it real enough and funny.

Now the shield as boomerang surprised me, not having read the comics, and I loved it eventually. Almost too exciting for my little self. It was great!

4698269,3,B005GYJPYW,"After a brief opening sequence revealing a startling find in the Arctic, we find ourselves taken back to the height of World War II. A Nazi officer (Hugo Weaving) and his men lead a raid in order to steal an object of great power and mystery. Simultaneously, in NYC, we see Steve Rogers (played in 98-pound-weakling form a la Benjamin Button by Chris Pine). Rogers (Pine) is being denied the opportunity to serve his country in the military due to various physical issues. Not long after this, however, a mysterious man (Stanley Tucci) offers him the opportunity to be a part of the Army's new super soldier program. And, with a little delay, Captain America is born.

  Having never read the original comic books, I can't speak to their endearing qualities. And their timely inception no doubt did a great deal to inspire its readers, but the tone of the film is campy, and I don't believe it was meant to be. In addition, Pine (Captain America) doesn't really have the gravitas to pull of the role. I liked him and his co-stars in The Losers, and he was near brilliant in the irreverent, tragically-underrated masterpiece Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, but both those films had there roots planted in comedy. The First Avenger does not.",1326499200,,1236,4.712962962962963
4698270,3,B005GYJPYW,"If you loved Captain America comics, you will enjoy this movie.

Firstly think 'the curious case of Benjamin Button'. This is how I saw the transition of Steve Rogers (a very small skinny guy) into Captain America - a fairly large muscular guy. Obviously a lot of computer work went on here. Although all very well done, there was still something slightly disturbing about this transition.

The anomaly that sort of diminished this movie is that it is set in the 1940s, yet the technology seems to be on-par, or exceeds what we have today - ray guns that can vaporize an entire human in a single shot. This begs the question, why more like Captain America were not made, and how come over a period of 70 years we have not been able to perfect and replicate this kind of technology.

Putting aside these issues... The acting and the movie as a whole is entertaining. Hugo Weaving puts on an excellent performance as the bad guy. Another weird thing about this movie was the idea of the US Army using their most combat ready soldier for musicals and cheap entertainment. Very strange ... but I suppose they had to have some filler to make up the time, so that it would be a full movie.",1326499200,,1183,4.467592592592593

What I got was a bland rehashing of some hero-like story that was too focused on being politically correct rather than true to the comic book. This simply made it annoying and boring, rather than aspiring or relevant to today's kid. All in all, this was a fatal flaw with the movie. The acting was good, but this made the movie almost unwatchable. Get it, but be ready for politically correct hero-like antics. :(",1326240000,,521,4.553191489361702

And I was not disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although seeing Elrond as a bad guy was kind of hard to take. Glad he pulled out the red make-up so I would quit thinking about Elrond. But seriously, the movie is definitely worth watching if you like the super-hero genre. Because Cap is not really a super-hero with special powers except for exceptional strength and endurance as a result of a ""super soldier"" experiment. The costume is toned down so that it looks like a cross between a super-hero costume and regular soldier's uniform. I was just a bit disappointed in the ending which I will not reveal, but it sets up a sequel, I suppose.",1326067200,,825,4.363636363636363
4698277,5,B005GYJPYW,"Update:

I saw ""Captain America"" again for the third time. This time projected from a 35mm print and, while there are a few brief moments which were designed for 3D that aren't quite as cool in 2D, overall it is a much more rewarding experience than the underlit 3D presentations I saw. This is really a bright, colorful film with lots of detail in the action, sets, backgrounds, and facial expressions which are lost in the dimness of digital presentation. Well worth a second viewing if you can find someplace running it on film. I expect that the DVD and Blu-Ray will be closer to the brightness of film than the dimness of digital theatrical projection.

Original post:

Saw ""Captain America"" twice already. Both times in 3D (which ain't too shabby). Liked it the first time. Liked a lot better the second time - for a couple of reasons.

The first is that I wasn't distracted reconciling the movie with the comics. The movie is very, very good but, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B0034G4P80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>, it has the job of filling in all of the back story needed for The Avengers in 2012 and there's a LOT more back story. Captain America really deserved Iron Man's two film lead in. And, as much as the movie does an impressive job adapting decades of story into two hours there are inevitable differences some of which were a bit jarring to me. On second viewing I could appreciate the movie for itself because I already knew where it differed from the stories I was familiar with.

The second viewing, I saw the movie with my teenage daughter who knows almost nothing about the character and I was curious how she would respond to it. We, of course, stayed through the credits for the anticipated after credit scene and then this occurred:

The movie ends. Daughter turns to me.

Daughter: ""Really?""

We stand and walk to the end of the row.

Daughter: ""Really?""

We walk up the aisle a bit.

Daughter: ""An ad?""

And a bit farther.

Daughter: ""That's stupid.""

A bit farther.

Daughter: ""As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?""

We exit the theater and in the lobby are four of her friends. They greet and hug and ask ""what are you seeing? and ""what did you see?""

Friend: ""We're going to see Harry Potter again.""
Daughter: ""Captain America""
Friend: ""Cool. How is it?""
Daughter: ""Ummm...""
Friend: ""Oh. That good?""
Daughter: ""Well ...""
Friend: ""What would you rate it?""
Daughter: ""Mmmm...three stars.""
Friend: ""Oh.""

The friends obviously have no interest in seeing Captain America now.

Daughter: ""But stay 'til the end""
Daughter: ""It's disappointing, but stay 'til the end.""

The friends obviously now have less than no interest in seeing Captain America.

We leave the theater, walking to the car.

Daughter: ""That free-fall fight was cool!""

Me: ""Yeah. I liked that a lot, too.""

Daughter: ""I'd have probably given it four stars but that ad at the end was a dumb move.""

Me: ""I liked the movie a lot more this time. I think because I knew what to expect and wasn't trying to reconcile the movie with the comics and I knew when the movie really ended and when to stop expecting more. I think the ad at the end colored my feelings about the movie, too.""

Daughter: ""Yeah. When we sat through the credits and it said 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' I though 'We stayed for that?'. But then the tag and the ad played and I thought 'ending with 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' would have been better. Or ending after the little punching bag scene. It wouldn't have been GOOD, but it would have been BETTER.""

The moral: Marvel Studios, which had been doing a great job building anticipation for The Avengers with the tag scenes after the credits which teased and enticed, went for the hard sell. I doubt that that hard sell is building audience because, as daughter said, ""As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?"" But the hard sell almost certainly lost the sale of four tickets to Captain America which daughter's friends had been interested in (and had both time and disposable income to spend for) because the Avengers ad disappointed her and unfavorably influenced her immediate response to the movie.

Y'know, for good word of mouth you want to send people out on a high note, not feeling like they've been subject to a bait and switch; expecting the tradition of a cool teaser tag to continue in this movie but being delivered a tiny anemic tag followed by a routine and traditional ad.",1325980800,,4603,4.792405063291139

4698287,3,B005GYJPYW,Here goes Hollywood putting there spin on the movie not following the original Comic story-line but in this case it actually worked but for one problem...........choosing Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm to be Steve Rogers.  The extra muscle he gained looked unnatural where Steve Rogers had a natural muscular built to him and too much humor was brought to the role just like in that other pathetic movie....Green Lantern.  Hollywood needs to take their time in finding the right person for the role like they did in  Thor.  But it will never happen!!,1325721600,,549,4.934782608695652
4698288,3,B005GYJPYW,"I want to say this.  I am firmly convinced that Chris Evans IS a super hero.  Sadly, he isn't much of an actor, and it shows in this film.  He just isn't convincing as a person, constantly displaced from the people around him (especially the stunning Hayley Atwell, who can actually act her butt off here).  Honestly though, Chris Evans is the least of this film's problems.

`Captain America: The First Avenger' suffers from trying to do too much without placing it firmly in focus.  It opens VERY strong, establishing young sickly Steve Rogers' backstory very well.  As an origin story, this film gets it and it works it beautifully.  This is aided by the beautiful production design, recreating an era and a place that consumes every frame.  From the costumes to the set pieces to the brilliantly cloaked cinematography, `Captain America' promises to be amazing.  Sadly, after Steve Rogers makes his transformation and his first heroic act the film loses its footing.  This comes from rapid segments that feel like an excuse to show pointless action sequences.  There is no meat in these scenes.  Secondly, the reveal of Hugo Weaving's villain seems kind of anticlimactic (why does he wait so long to show his comrades something he doesn't seem so intent of hiding anyways).  All of these elements create a second half that drags pretty badly.  The film wares out its welcome before it is half over.

Still, some of the scenes are expertly crafted, and the technical elements at play here are nicely composed (making Chris Evans a scrawny little twig of a man is not only mind-blowing but believable) but in the end, this is a film that only `half' works.  I just wish they had stopped while they were ahead.",1325721600,,1711,4.76530612244898

4698292,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is one of those super hero movies that actually lives up to it's promise. Chris Evans is perfect as the spirited young American boy who has his heart and mind in the right place. What he lacks to go with his indomitable spirit is a body to match. This 80 lb weakling with the spirit of a lion hasn't long to wait as WWII brings a need for men like Steve Rodgers, but he lacks the physicality to serve in the military. His patriotism and spirit won't allow him to take ""NO"" for an answer. Rejection is not in Steve Rodger's book. After receiving ""several"" F4 ratings for being physically unfit for service, Steve tries one last time and is noticed by an imminent scientist, Dr. Reinstein, who takes notice of Steve's spirit and determination and that makes him the ideal subject for his experiment to create a ""super soldier"" for the US military. Reinstein ok's the papers and Steve is in the military, but it won't be easy sailing as Steve is about to discover, as his life and body are changed forever. Along for the ride is Steve's best friend, the businessman/inventor grandfather of Ironman, a lovely female soldier with eyes for Steve, both before and after his transformation and a team of fellow soldier misfits who form a ""lose"" team headed by Captain America.

I saw this movie in the theater it's opening weekend in a packed house. The movie was an instant hit with the audience. There were actual applause and cheers during the showing. Something I haven't seen in a movie showing for some time! The film is rich in American patriotism, as was common during the story period, and is not shy with a positive American presentation. The villains are perfectly matched to the heroes. Red Skull was created using an imperfected version of the process that created Captain America. As head of Hydra (an organization created by Hitler and the Nazis to further Nazi military technologies), Red Skull betrays the Nazi government to fulfill his own plans and desires and turns Hydra into his own power base with a totally loyal army of his own. He even kills several top Nazi leaders to send Hitler the message. Using top Nazi scientist and advanced Nazi technologies, he and Hydra are a true threat to the world that leaves the Nazis and Hitler in the dust.

To stop Red Skull and Hydra brings out the best in Steve and his team, but at great cost. And this leads Captain America to become a true super hero as he must sacrifice everything he knows to do what is right. His ultimate challenge will be his long sleep in frozen hibernation, after thwarting Red Skull, that allows him to continue into our modern times and to become a part of the Avenger team today after his body is discovered in a glacier.

Not a cheesy or quaint film or story, but a rediscovery of what it truly means to be an American and what America stands for. All embodied in a boy given the chance to prove himself and the spirit of Americanism within him.",1325462400,,2948,4.558490566037736

I have no gripes with Tommy Lee as an actor.  As a fellow South-Central Texan, Tommy Lee is absolutely A-OK in my book!

However, in this movie, he looks as if he's 80+ years old!  He don't look like no active Colonel I've ever served with!  The bags under the eyes and the wrinkles made him look as if he should have been wearing a VFW Legion Post cap, instead of the cap of an active duty Army Colonel.  You would think that, at least the folks in the Makeup Department could have tried to make him look at least 10 years younger!

The movie is set in the 1940s but also has a futuristic feel to it. If you are a die hard fan of Captain America you will not be disappointed.

And as a comic book hero Captain America is definitely not as edgy and as modern as either Spiderman or the X-Men; in fact, there's something suspiciously corny any hero named ""Captain America,"" and the movie capitalizes on this to good effect.

Perhaps just sticking to the source material would suit a lot of these attempts at new superhero movies better.

4698317,2,B005GYJPYW,"This was another blockbuster film that I came to with high hopes, only to end up disappointed. As usual, the problems with this film start with the script, which is limp and suffers from a poor third act, but the director has to take a lot of the blame as well. Never using subtlety when a sledgehammer will do, never allowing any character relationships to develop when a nonsensical action scene could be squeezed in, this film is a bit of a mess.

It's not without merit, but is far too stylised - yes, we're in ""comic book land"", but the events that unfold here do not occur in a parallel universe, they specifically refer to real-life events such as the war and the rise of Nazi Germany. Instead of allowing any vaguely reasonable nods to historical accuracy and then dropping the fantasy elements on top of that to make a nicely cohesive world, as a more intelligent director would have done, Joe Johnston has clearly gone through the production drawings for sets, props, clothing etc. that his designers have come up with, has looked through them for the most outlandish, silly thing he can find and has shrieked ""THAT ONE!!"" when he's found it. Headlights on Nazi officers' cars, for instance - instead of being vaguely useful beams to cast light into the foggy darkness, we've got what are clearly LEDs in a slit formation, obviously designed to look like menacing eyes. Or when a car crashes through the wall of a church, the scene is suddenly and inexplicably lit by four-lamp spotlights on tripods which have been conveniently placed right outside the church in order to light the villain to maximum effect.

The film's also peppered with stupid, irritating logical flaws and plot holes. When the fantasy elements of a film like this fit in nicely with the reality of the time in which it's set, or if a fantasy film creates its own logically consistent world (even if that world is completely invented) then a viewer can readily suspend disbelief; when a film throws all sense to the winds merely in order to look flash or to attempt to raise a wry smile, it fails.",1324944000,3,2078,4.644021739130435

The origin was wonderful, and Stanley Tucci did a wonderful job making Professor Erskine into more than just a cardboard character.  Chris Evans was great, and so was the rest of the cast.  Costuming was wonderful, they took what was in the comics and came up with versions that seemed more believable and worked better in real life.  Special effects were also wonderful, especially the way that Steve transformed from scrawny to super soldier.

4698329,2,B005GYJPYW,"This movie has a lot of problems.  SPOILERS.

First of all, the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) is supposed to be pure of heart, but he comes across as merely childish.  He is innocent to the point of being stupid.  I never got the impression that he was ""good"" in the way Superman is good - out of deep moral conviction.  Rather, Rogers was ""good"" more like a puppy is good.

Also, many of the plot details were just sort of lame.

Starting from the beginning - Rogers is a runt who becomes a super soldier after being injected with a formula.  However, the scientist who invented the formula is killed, and the formula itself is destroyed immediately after the experiment.  Therefore, the general in charge decides that Rogers would be better off selling war bonds than being a soldier.  Wait... huh?  The general originally wanted an entire army of super soldiers, but now he has only one.  Well, Rogers is still a super soldier, so why not use him for that?  Nope - the general figures he isn't worth it so a politician signs Rogers up to for an acting job with a bunch of showgirls.  Huh?

Moving on... when Rogers goes out on his own to infiltrate the Hydra base, he does so with his Captain America stars and stripes shield strapped to his back.  Huh?  Who tries to sneak into an enemy base with a big `ol America flag hanging off of their back?  That's just dumb.

Did anyone else find the selection of the ""new"" shield particularly silly?  Stark (the father of the Stark who is Iron Man) designs several shield designs for Rogers and then gives him a choice.  Rogers looks over the selection on the table, but then notices a circular shield stashed away under the table.  Rogers is like - hey... what's this... I like this one.  Starks response is - oh no... you can't have that one... it is made of a very ""special"" metal and that shield represents all that there is in the entire world.  Of course, this is the shield Rogers ends up with.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Are you telling me that there are only a few pounds of this ""special"" metal and that the best thing the scientists could think up to do with it is to fashion it in the shape of a metal disk?  Also, why the heck was it under the table in the first place?  If it is a shield, then put it on the table for Rogers to pick.  If it is not available, don't hide it under the table.  Or, if you are actually trying to hide it, don't do such a sloppy job of it so that any fool walking by would just see it sticking out.

Anyway - regardless of all this silliness, the nutshell of the plot is that Captain leads American troops to take out a bunch of Hydra bases around Europe.  ""Hydra"" is a branch of Nazi Germany - except it isn't... it is really more like Cobra or something.  The leader of Hydra is a dude with a red skull who was the subject of the first super soldier experiment.  The red skull guy comes into possession of an ancient artifact of the gods that provides basically unlimited power to make laser weapons and such.  He intends to use this power to destroy the world - including Nazi Germany.  Why?  Who knows... that really isn't clear - he is just evil.  Go with it.  It also isn't clear how Nazi Germany came up with the funds and resources to build all of these Hydra bases in the first place.

So here we have the basic outlines of the plot.  The good guys go after each base and beat the bad guys who, even though they have great weapons, can't figure out how to shoot straight.

The climax comes when Rogers has to defeat the red skull guy on his stealth bomber of death which is heading toward the US to bomb the whole Eastern coast.  To save the US (and the world I suppose), Rogers decides he must crash the ship in order to stop it... and for some reason he must pilot it all the way into the ground himself.  Uhhhh... why can't he just smash the controls and then fly off the plane in one of the dozens of little bomb jets that are on board?  Why does he have to go down with it?  Oh wait... that's the only way we can get him to freeze so he can wake up in the future.

4698336,3,B005GYJPYW,"It's harder than you would think to make an action adventure film based on the pulp simplicity of the old timers. More so now than ever before, action films have drawn upon each other from years - even months - past, all for the sake of placing a stake in present ideologies and notions of what these specific movies are meant to represent. It's limiting, but it can usually mean a quick buck or two for those limited directors who put a bit of effort into creating something moderately intriguing.

And then, we have Captain America. Before I could begin to study an odd, nostalgic throwback into the very recent voids of American cinema, Joe Johnston did it for me. Joe Johnston's interpretation of Marvel's sanctuary isn't modern; it's hardly memorable. That said, if Captain America: The First Avenger is anything, it isn't nauseously replicated by experiences months past. It is retro, such is the word that is used so seldom. There are things that a CGI unit can do to evoke such an effect: Grain filters, washed out colors, light blooming; that said, it doesn't necessarily work under the circumstances that most modern films are granted - or, perhaps, burdened - with. Johnston has an eye for these intangibles, not the least of which is dedicated to his work on both the Mummy and the Rocketeer, two completely safe and secure action films which helped to epitomize the 90's before bullet time dominated the scene.

It is wholly pulp, characeristically old fashioned, and almost painfully short sighted, but that's where all of the charm seems to lie, anyway. More than anything, Chris Evans' work needs to be applauded. Drawing his own line between insecure empathy and a hoax patriotism of sorts, Evans works well with a role which would be seemingly inflexible, allowing the audience to witness a progression of maturity from what is, perhaps, the most iconic superhero of all. There really isn't much else to say about the performances: Weaving is a hopelessly evil sociopath with superhuman tendencies, Tommy Lee Jones offers some comic relief, and there's a love interest. As far as situational awareness presents itself, these are the basics.

Plenty of this is complemented by a massive, exuberant atmosphere which evokes the majesty of the American 40's extremely well. This is most definitely where Johnston and company shine, and it's no surprise, given his extensive track record. Buildings are massive, explosions are pretty, and people die with dignity. It would be hard to call it anything other than pure family fodder if not for Evans' performance, which seems to be a vessel for others to observe and be inspired by. Chris Evans is a man who understands both the innocence and the responsibility of a ""rising"" Captain America, which is undeniably a vital component in establishing a proper atmosphere.

The imposing, impressive badass will come later; for now, Captain America is a man limited to his very clean and admirable philosophies, and it's as good a film as any to stem into Whedon's magnificent epic, ""The Avengers!""",1324166400,2,3053,4.95703125
4698337,3,B005GYJPYW,I found this movie to be a complete waste of an afternoon and $19.99. I was highly anticipating this to be a good well thought out action movie but it fell way short of my expectations. I also expected the Blu-ray visuals and special effects to be great but... not so much. This movie is just barely OK but I definitely wouldn't put it on my movies to buy list at least not until it hits the $5.00 bin.,1324166400,,402,4.10126582278481
4698338,2,B005GYJPYW,"I expected a lot from CAPTAIN AMERICA considering it got very good reviews from critics and moviegoers alike. I am in the minority in that I did not find it to be that great of a movie. My reason is pretty simple: the movie is packed with amazing special effects, is stylish, rich, and honestly looks fantastic. Unfortunately the characters are a major let down.

To have a good protagonist, you need a few things. One is a special skill, ability, or other reason to like them that differentiates them from secondary characters. Maybe they are a great leader (Patten), have a brilliant mind (Sherlock Holmes), are athletically gifted (Chariots of Fire), etc... They also need a good weakness, something that shows their human side. Sherlock is a dope fiend. Patton can't see the basic human needs of his soldiers. You get the idea. It's the interplay of the greatness and the weakness that makes them interesting and fun to root for. Luke Skywalker is likeable as much for his massive potential as a Jedi as for his naivety and occasional stupidity.

As far as I can tell, Captain America's only weakness is that he started out very weak. That's cured in the first 15 minutes of the movie, leaving a character so virtuous, powerful, and convincingly good that the central question of his ultimate success is never in doubt. He is stronger, faster, and just so gosh darn-it likeable that his larger struggles against Red Skull and his minor romantic complications seem overbearingly devoid of risk. You could argue that his being overlooked as a soldier and turned into a marketing piece for the Army would constitute a weakness, but that is an external factor, not an internal one. I wanted his former psychology of being the little guy, the weak one, the picked on, to take him interesting places. Not create an emotional shambles, but at least present challenges for him. What do you do when you suddenly have the power you never experienced before? I wanted to see him make a few mistakes and learn from them.

Couple that with weak secondary characters most of which are introduced messily (the united nations team of misfit soldiers, all of whom seem modeled of someone else, rather than actually being someone themselves are the prime example), and you have a movie with a lot of pop and little substance.

The story is average, but feels too full of stuff with nothing really explored that well. Red Skull had the potential to be frightening, but he basically whines to his minions when things don't go his way, hides, or escapes. He only faces Captain when Captain forces the issue, and again, it's resolved so quickly and easily, the audience never has to worry about the outcome. Antagonists should be frightening, not just unlikable. Contrast Red Skull with the most recent incarnation of the Joker from THE DARK KNIGHT if you want to know exactly what I mean. The Joker terrified because he was not dependent on anyone else, because he had gravitas, because he was so much the antithesis of Batman. Red Skull is just a Nazi with incredible strength. He's no more or less frightening than a normal man with normal abilities.

I would argue Captains' finest antagonist would be a character who is strong through his mind and devilishness, not brute strength. Someone to juxtapose the raw Tim Tebow-ness of Captain against malicious forethought and planning. I wanted Captain up to his eyeballs in stress, fighting for his life against traps and dirty tricks. Give him meaningful, complicated choices that expose the man under the Red-White-and-Blue.

All in all CAPTAIN AMERICA was an ok movie. I did not hate it. I just did not find it fulfilling. It does have a few great moments, probably the best of which involves the movie staple of forced moral decision (should I catch the bad guy or save the baby / old woman / falling buss of nuns) and takes it a very funny and unexpected direction. Other highlights include a very well done chase scene, and the film's first 5 minutes which harken back to the X-files or ABYSS in their creepy perfection.

Although this was the last movie in the series, it tells the story of the very first Avenger, Captairn America, who with his intrepid group of soldiers led the fight against a secret organization led by RED SKULL durring WW2. It also tells you how Captain America survived to be transported into the future to join up with The Hulk, Iron Man, & Thor led by their leader Nick Fury, played by Samuel Jackson who was in the ending of every one of the movies (you need to watch the credits of each one to see him). Stan Lee and Marvel have been working up towards this for several years and I myself am extreamly anxious to see the new movie ""THE AVENGERS"" next year. They are bringing back all the original cast for each part with exception of The Hulk who this time will be played by Mark Ruflo, after Edward Norton had a spat with Marvel over the 2nd Hulk movie. Norton endorsed and encouraged Mark to do the part as they are old friends. The original part was played by Eric Bana. I highly recommend this movie, and strongly suggest that you get all of the series so that you will be ready for the new movie next year.

This movie takes itself far to seriously and doesn't bother to provide any introduction to the characters and what role they play in the film. Hugo Weaving is exceptional as Red Skull but again he is underutilized.

The movie spends far too much time to get going and when it does the action is disjointed and the characters are poorly developed and less than interesting.

4698375,5,B005GYJPYW,"Besides being a tremendously smart and even emotional film, it's also refreshing to see a lead hero be just that... a hero. Steve is no morbid vigalante or narcissitic self absorbed anti-hero. He's the real deal. His tough life hasn't made him bitter or jaded. In fact, it's done just the opposite. He's needed to develop character because his body didn't develop. This is the key to Cap both in the books and in the film. Heart and character trump the physical elements and are what truly makes the character itself special. Even after he's given the great gift of being a ""super soldier,"" he still continues to do the right thing. It's not to prove anything to anyone other than himself because he has a high moral code. I love the fact that they choose his character for the experiment because he wouldn't take advantage of the gift. That's smart writing. Cap's first assignment from the U.S. government is to be the centerpiece in a traveling USO show, building morale and raising money for the war effort. Eventually, he finds he's wasting his new abilities and NEEDS to break away on his own to fight the Nazi menace. This brings him to conflict with the awesomely diabolical Red Skull. The Skull is one of Marvel's best crazed villains and they captured that perfectly. Here, the Red Skull was a guinea pig for a similar Nazi super soldier experiment that went very wrong. These clashes and confrontations are everything they should be and more.  Shades of gray are great in film (and there are those tones present here) but sometimes it's good to have character of pure heart, pure integrity and true morality take it to what history and everyone knows was pure evil.  It's refreshing to sit back and root for the ultimate good to take it to the ultimate bad guys.

The two leads, Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell, look good in uniform but are woefully devoid of charisma.  Casting directors, just because an alleged actor or actress has a nice body, it doesn't mean he or she can carry a movie, even a special effects extravaganza like this one!

Only the ever resourceful Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci make much of an impression here, and that would be -- look what good actors will do for a paycheck...

The director Joe Johnston must take a large part of the blame for the lack of suspense here.  I liked his ""Wolfman"" and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"", but this film must take its place among his growing list of misses.

Really, American film makers are going to have to find more worthy sources of inspiration than Comicon -- or the mortgages on their McMansions.

Finally this DVD appears to be devoid of any extras, but in this case that's probably not an issue.  I did wonder, however, how CGI managed to make such a transformation in Evans' body from 90-pound weakling to hulk.  I am guessing the color green played a role.",1322956800,,1187,4.614285714285714

As far as the cast is concerned, I thought Chris Evans did a fine job as Steve Rogers / Cap and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Phillips. I also really liked Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell was OK, but didn't really stand out at all and Hugo Weaving did the best he could with the material he was given.

4698382,1,B005GYJPYW,"I have to admit a lot of mixed feelings on this movie.  Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, and a few others I recognized in this film notwithstanding, somehow this movie cheapens the above and beyond super heroism of everyday men and women in the armed forces serving in hostile zones of combat.  Maybe it was different in WWI or WWII, but beginning with the Korean war, this country has had trouble welcoming their heroes returning from war - especially from Vietnam and since that time.  These days there are no ticker tape parades and cheering crowds who respect and honor the men and women who have watched their fellow soldiers die on the battle field.  There is widespread unemployment, a nation near bankruptcy, and a misery index as high or higher than when Jimmy Carter was president.  And this film won't make you feel good about being given a 4F rating by the Selective Service System registration office, if you honestly wanted to serve in the military.  So it is hard for me to rally behind a film that suggests our nation's finest require a super-chemistry enhanced hero to inspire them to enthusiastically face the enemy.  Especially if the country you're fighting in hates you being there.  But never mind all that, it's just a movie.  A movie about how drugs can make women fall in love with you, taking drugs and experimenting with drugs can make men who hate you willing to follow you as their leader and fight by your side for whatever mission you personally undertake, and taking drugs and experimenting with drugs will let you live over a hundred years and never physically age a single day.  The message in this film is that a sublevel romance that never finds fruition is enough to give somebody the inspiration to accomplish anything even far above and beyond human ability - no wait, that was the drugs, nevermind.  This movie has very little gore, predominantly has a lot of gun violence (more of what today's America desperately needs), a little bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.  It's a PG-13 film, and for having a 140 million dollar budget, you'd think the writers and producers would require a little bit more out of the director and editor.  Dud, flop, fail, fizzle, flummox, lay an egg, loser, turkey, and weenie.  Not even a good chic flick.  I wouldn't give this away to somebody I hated.

The movie has several scenes lifted shot for shot from the comics I read in the 1960s.  It is a conversion that respects the original material and offers changes that are reasonable where needed.  Chris Evans does a masterful job in bringing Steve Rogers to the movie screen.  His acting makes Captain Americas shield use believable.

4698402,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America is an American World War II superhero movie of a rejected U.S. Army recriut Steve Rodgers in 1943. It took him 5 tries until Dr. Abraham Urshkin gives him only a chance to be recriuted. Nobody believed Rodgers could enlist, because he was short, weak, whimpy, and contained health issues. The U.S. Army was working on a top secret scientific project that can turn a human being into a supersoldier. In boot camp, Steve Rodgers was tested to his ability determining his skills for combat and being picked to be transformed into a supersoldier and ended up  failing the tests. Colonel Phillips didn't want Urskin to make sure Rodgers was transformed in to a supersoldier due to his poor performance. Dr. Urshkin still again picks him, because he was looking for inner strength, which Rodgers had. The next morning, Steve Rodgers became Captain America and was transformed into a supersoldier with big muscles, super speed, strength, etc. He was sent overseas to fight HYDRA, the Nazi deep science division led by Johann Scmidt (Red Skull). Captain America was expected to return with full victory for America and defeat HYDRA.

4698403,4,B005GYJPYW,"I rented the Blu-Ray edition of Captain America through RedBox.  The following week, I rented it again.  That was ridiculous, but that fairly expresses my opinion of the movie: don't waste $1.59 (twice), buy it for $20.

CAPTAIN AMERICA isn't a flawless movie: it's 4-stars, not 5-stars.  To add some rants and address some reviews:

1. The film is pro-American
Absolutely.  It's unabashedly so.  It's [expletive] Captain America!  Compare to actual WW II propaganda (c.f., Signal Corps museum at Fort Gordon) - shocking in the Age of Apology.

2. ""Cheese to the rescue""
This is SHANE not PALE RIDER.  Captain America precedes the modern convention of the anti-hero, and the movie reflects that.

3. Some actors are under-utilized
The ""cow"" one-liner was rather painful (my drink went up and out my nose), and I foresee extensive usage of the ""YOU ARE FAILING!!!"" clip in graduate schools across the world.  Unfortunately, that's the extent of the highlights from Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving.",1322179200,,997,5.049079754601227

The special effects don't feel too ""cartoony"" either. Another good thing is that the director remembered that he was filming in 3D when he framed each shot. That way, you get the thrill of having things leap off the screen at you, as opposed to some 3D movies where things which should have come off the screen just fall out of the shot to the side instead. Why film it in 3D if you're going to make it look flat? (Watch ""Tron Legacy"" in 3D and you'll see what I mean.)",1322179200,,703,4.253731343283582

4698415,2,B005GYJPYW,"Chris Evans is great for the part and does a bang up job, even with the wax museum looking girlfriend. The girlfriend should look like Betty Grable... not like an oily haired fish face. The movie lacks a 1940's dialogue... as in slang... which really ruins it in so many ways. Tommy Lee Jones looks way to old in his part and should give it up or get his face tightened up. There's no smoking in the movie but people getting killed is fine... typical PC crap. There are way too many Cobalt blue lights in this movie and it really makes things look phony. It would have been nice to see how the Captain learned how to use the shield... instead we are treated to what amounts to be a series  of video game combat scenes that lack meaning. Also... you can't look at the big bad guy without thinking ""Matrix""... a bad casting choice. I'd say rent it first before you buy.

Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the end, I found myself trying to convince myself I didn't waste my time or money.

In my opinion, the movie failed to capitalize on the great cast and instead went for a very safe route or what the movie executives perceived as 'safe'. The dialogue was quite boring and there was not enough time devoted to developing the characters. In the end it felt rushed and underdeveloped. There were little character I could relate to and Tommy Lee Jone was pretty much had the only memorable moments. There is no replay value. Very sad. I really wanted to like this movie. I could give a second movie a try but I will wait to after I read reviews this time. The Avengers movie doesn't have me too excited but hopefully it will rock.",1322006400,2,937,4.47953216374269

RENT IT FIRST!

I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.
For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.

Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an ""Extended"", ""Super"", ""Ultimate"", ""Collectors"" version of whatever movie at some point.
I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your ""Ultimate"", ""Platinum"", ""Gold"", ""Silver"", ""Special Anniversary"" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies.

Of course we hear that about a lot of different movies but the weird thing with this movie is that I hadn't heard really anything negative about it at all.

The plot is decent at best. It's entirely predictable but that's not the problem to me. The problem is that it's just kinda the same thing we've seen over and over. There really isn't anything different that stands out to me, besides the beginning and the end. Sure it was entertaining at times but more times than not I would ask ""Really?"" Whether Captain America was doing song and dance (one scene) or mysteriously comes out alive of certain situations, it just kinda left me blase.

4698426,4,B005GYJPYW,"If ever you needed proof that Chris Evans can act as someone other then a douche, this movie is it. Captain America may not have the most complex characters in it, but the focus on Rodgers as a good guy rather then Captain America as a hero for the first part of the film feels heart felt and true. Having an under dog with a heart of gold isn't anything original, but this film isn't going for unique and gritty like many modern comic adaptations are. As for how everyone else does in their roles, there really isn't a stinker in the entire cast. Hayley Atwell is gorgeous and doesn't overdue the ""girl power"" thing, though I'm getting tired of the forced love interest in Marvel movies. Sebastien Stan plays a pretty serious and much more mature Bucky then I was expecting (honestly, who thought Bucky would even be in this movie?). Dominic Cooper's Stark has just enough Downey Jr in it to feel the connection, but not so much it feels like a rip off. As for Hugo Weaving, he does a great job with what he has, but not much of the run time is spent developing his character which is slightly disappointing. Most of the exposition on Red Skull is given through dialogue to Rogers, so we aren't given much to find interesting about his personality. Then again, it's a character named ""The Red Skull"", some one so bad even the Nazis think he's evil. Is there anything else you need to know?

The visual effects are varied, with some being phenomenal (The weakening of Evans looks very convincing) to pretty horrendous ( much of the Cg movement (I.E the train scene) looks videogame-ey and fake). The costume designs work with what the source material gives, and the way they integrate Captain America's costume is pure genius. That goes for the campiness of the original comics as well. The movie never parodies it completely, but works it into the plot to push the action forward. All I'll say is Captain America does hit Hitler, sort of, and it's awesome.

Finally, there is the action of the film to talk about. It encompasses a good part of the latter half of the film. The fight choreography is fine, as you'd expect from a comic movie, with some fun and unique uses of the shield. The amount of violence can be a bit surprising, as we see bullet holes rip though Hydra bodies and one man gets thrown into a propeller. It's nothing that will make you grabbing for the vomit bag, but it still feels a bit out of place in a film where the main character is so opposed to killing. Over all the action is well shot an engaging.

Captain America ends up being a slight bit better then Thor, not quite as good as Iron Man, and totally worth watching.",1321488000,2,2649,4.457731958762887

I think the biggest problem with this movie is the director. The only Joe Johnston movie I enjoyed was the perfect Rocketeer. I thought Jurassic Park 3 was a franchise-killer, Hildalgo - bleh. And nevermind The Wolfman.

I thought it was great to do a period film when showing the origins of Captain America and staying with the original comics. However I found the pacing to be a bit off. I was actually bored with most of this movie. Every character seemed very bland. Even the fantastic Hugo Weaving was demoted to half-a-second moments.

While I did enjoy this movie more than Thor, I'm not sure what I should expect from Marvel and their super hero movies anymore. If this was a tease of what's to come in The Avengers, I shudder.

On the plus side, this does equal summer fun. There isn't anything questionable as far as content. I was just hoping for more super in this hero. Let's hope we'll get that in The Avengers and the next Captain movie.",1321401600,3,1170,4.583732057416268

4698432,4,B005GYJPYW,"Chris Evans becomes America's ultimate weapon against evil in the fun-filled superhero adventure Captain America: The First Avenger. In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discovered an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination. Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed romp. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci.

If you're a fan of comic book heroes or good old-fashioned adventure, then Captain America: The First Avenger is a highly recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The comic book blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not the sharpest transfer of any Paramount releases, the movie still looks fantastic with fine detail and vivid colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack delivers fine clarity, well balanced surround effects and good bass. The Blu-Ray features a nice variety of extras: audio commentary track with director Joe Johnston and production crew, five minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, and six behind-the-scenes and in-depth comic book featurettes.

4698434,3,B005GYJPYW,"This movie is faithful to the comic book, including the ridiculously juvenile story. That's good if you are aged 7-15. Not so good if you are looking for an adult version of Captain America.

Captain America's nemsis, the Red Skull, has possibly the worst and the most fake looking nose I have ever seen. The main female character plays an US Army Officer with noticeably strong British accent. The motorcycle chase scene reminded me of the MotoRacer game on my iPhone (this is not a compliment).

Captain America is never in danger of being killed, injured, or even getting his suit dirty because, well, he is Captain America. He deals with his enemies like a video game character with only about 3-4 moves that are constantly repeated. Moreover, Captain America is just too cool to use guns (except once) to kill the enemies. He just uses his shield and knocks out his enemies like a real hero. In the Marvel Comic world, real heros don't use guns and seldom kill, even if the character is an Army Captain fighting the Nazis in WWII.

I didn't think this was a particularly bad movie (hence the 3 stars). I would have seriously enjoyed this movie if I was 12. But grown-ups tend to like slightly different movies, and movie like this just is not one of them.

FYI, I really enjoyed Superman (1978), Spiderman 2, and Batman Returns. This movie does not belong in that category of great super-hero comic book movies.",1321315200,2,1416,4.652

4698436,4,B005GYJPYW,"I was surprised, but I liked this better than some of the Marvel Hero movies.

Growing up, I was more of an Iron Man fan, the first film was pretty good  but the 2nd Iron Man movie was horrible.
I wish they had not screwed up Tony Stark's character and turned him into a sarcastic one-liner smartass instead of the troubled character he was in the comic.

The Hulk movies were both pretty bad.

Thor was OK.

Ghost Rider was not too good.

I liked the nostalgia of the 1940's Captain America.
Some editing and story development seemed chopped and rushed even at over 2 hours.

But they successfully integrated all the classic elements of the Captain America character.

I wish there was a little less camp .... it went a bit into ""cheesy"" at times.
This has nothing to do with the 40's time period ............ the cheese I refer to was an occasional tendency to get a little too carried away with witty humor and a ""cuteness"".

So in the final analysis of Marvel hero films so far, I am adding the following to my DVD collection ........

Iron Man # 1  (not # 2)
Captain America
Thor

4698437,3,B005GYJPYW,"While I didn't expect much based on what has come out of Hollywood calling itself superhero movies in the last 10 years, I was still disappointed in how flat Captain America was.  Chris Evans made an excellent Captain America (IMHO), but the supporting cast came up too short.  I expected more from Tommy Lee Jones and way more from Hugo Weaving.  I love just about every character Hugo Weaving has ever played in his career, but his portrayal of the villain bored me to tears.  Maybe it was the directing?  Even the feel of the portrayal of the Nazis were off.  They got the look right, but that's about it.  I kept thinking that someone like Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have done a much better job at making this movie pop.

Captain America had potential, but it seemed like the powers that be were so intent on just getting it out in theatres to start working on an Avenger movie, that they kind of just threw it together and got lucky with choosing Chris Evans as the lead.  It's not the worst superhero movie I've seen (Punisher would be that), but like the majority of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past decade, it had nowhere near the depth and intensity that the new Batman movies (with Christian Bale) had nor did it have the fresh, fun, thrill and charm of the Superman movies (with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman) that came out in the late 70s.  Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America.... everyone else?  Not so much.  I thought the movie was a bit boring and for a superhero movie that is not good!",1321142400,3,1560,4.454225352112676
4698438,2,B005GYJPYW,"All though the movie I felt rushed, like the film makers were trying to get me out the door.
The scenes are predictable and forced in order to cram character development into 5 minutes. Even the action scenes were compiled into a simple montage that shown as a film within the movie.

The CG was also very poor. I guess they wanted to use the same cg from the film in the video games.

As a review for the amazon video service. It's very nice, but I would like to see more functions implemented like subtitles, settings management, and the ability to play HD movies on my computer not just on my tv.",1321142400,3,599,4.292035398230088
4698439,5,B005GYJPYW,"This was another really solid movie from Marvel.  I thought Thor was fine, but the first half of the movie was a bit slow.  Capt. doesn't suffer the same fate.  The beginning had plenty of character intro, but more drama.  The cinematography was great, the colors, set design etc was done very well, it felt like watching a Norman Rockwell painting.  It was patriotic without being sarcastic or ironic, and the acting was really good overall, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving,Stanley Tucci, can't beat them. And Haley Atwell...wow, just beautiful. The small Capt. CGI was flawless as well, they spend plenty of time with him so his transformation is that much more jarring.  There's a propeller scene ala Indianna Jones that might not be for the little ones but overall, definitely recommended.",1321142400,2,791,4.954545454545454

4698441,5,B005GYJPYW,"Let me start by saying I've been one of the biggest Captain America fans since 1973. I was 9 and since then have faithfully collected all his comics, what little merchandise I could pick up along the way and waited faithfully knowing someday he would get his own big budget movie, done right!! As a kid, i did enjoy the corny tv movies NBC made, tried to enjoy the 1991 movie with Matt Sallinger (but couldnt)and I was on pins and needles for this one. Went opening weekend with my son and came out smiling ear to ear!!!

The acting, script, directing all come together in such a way it's easy to forgive the couple of minor story flaws that deviate from the comic history. I am so proud of the movie and I just hope everyone enjoys it. It's not one of the cliched superhero and his neurotic past movies we've been overwhelmed with the last few years. It's truly an enjoyable family action movie any Captain America fan can be very proud of. I'm not going into story details because I don't want to give anything away but I am so thankful for this movie!!! I can't wait to see him in the Avengers movie next year. Good times ahead for Cap!!!!",1321056000,2,1142,4.336448598130841
4698442,5,B005GYJPYW,"As Captain America has been my favorite superhero forever, I was really worried about Chris Evans being cast in the role.  Turns out, the guy can flat out act.  He's perfect in this movie.  He has the right levels of apprehension, but the dogged determination to do what is right, not matter what the cost will be to himself.

Tommy Lee Jones is also great, though I do have an issue with his immediate dismissal of Cap after the experiment.  He couldn't think of a use for just one genetically modified ubermensch?

Hugo Weaving.  Wow, that guy can play any villain in any movie ever, and I'll be happy.

I'm also thrilled that Peggy Carter has skills and can take care of herself.  I was worried about the romance, but it was perfect for Cap.

The ending was perfect when Cap says he had a date.  Then he pushes it to the back of his head, and moves on.  Just the way Cap would.

Some nice easter eggs with the original Human Torch and Order 13 sure seemed like a reference to Agent 13, Sharon Carter.

Very well done.",1321056000,4,1020,4.328042328042328
4698443,5,B005GYJPYW,"This is overall a great movie.  Acting is sometimes arkward (especially when Chris Evans is in that stupid-looking Cap Costume selling War Bonds), but overall good.  There's TONS of action.  The featurettes are especialy interesting. My only complaint concerns one of the featurettes: The Assembly Begins. My first thought was ""making of featurette.""  Turns out, its another tease for the upcomong movie The Avengers.  Other than that, its a pretty good deal on a great movie.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves these 3 things: 1) superhero movies, 2) lots of action, and 3) a good movie in general.",1320969600,3,616,4.990196078431373
4698444,4,B005GYJPYW,"I found this to be a very well thought-out and developed story.  Yes, it's a comic book story, so there are unrealities that come with the territory - they make it what it is.  Still, providing the well known Nazi experimentation philosophy with bioengineering and advanced technology as a vehicle for super-weaponry and menacing villains was a great approach, and really clicks.  The entire development of Steve Rogers to Captain America from weakling to warrior god is completely engrossing and worth watching alone.  his selfless, kind, reserved character is never lost to his strength and cunning, true to the good doctor's last request.  I also really liked the ending:  something far different from the usual fare, with a sadness that fits quite well and only adds to the overall, satisfying experience.  The World War II setting was a brilliant way to establish a superhuman character, and the cinematography only complimented this idea.

I did have to withhold one star, however, for the severely gapped plot.  Many demands are made of the audience to either assume or remember the old comic book back stories to fill in many holes.  this is otherwise also very noticeable in the romantic subplot.  this could have been much better developed without sacrificing or distracting from the rest of the story.  also, some action sequences seem to be incomplete and require the viewer to just figure out how a transition was made or a leap completed.  I think that an extended director's cut is definitely warranted; at least another 30 minutes is needed to smooth out this somewhat jagged storyline.

other than that, I can definitely recommend this one for the fun-action-comicbook section of your collection.  The endearing, enduring qualities of a true human hero are not conquered by the superhuman flash-bang of a unique and alluring action flick.",1320969600,3,1855,5.075907590759076

4698446,5,B005GYJPYW,"My wife and sons saw this when it was in theaters and said I would enjoy it. ""I'll see it when it comes out on video"", was my reply. I realize now that I missed out not only on a tremendously fun theater experience, but also on an object lesson on the value of character. C.A. successfully transforms the comic book hero into a man. The defining moment for our superhero occurs just before he undergoes the treatment. Dr. Erskine asks, ""You must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.""

Other pluses: An array of well-developed characters in spite of its genre, a nascent love story effectively carried off by the actress Hayley Atwell, and the defeat of evil personified convincingly by Hugo Weaving.

C.A. is an enjoyable reminder in our jaded age that honor and sacrificial love are ""super-hero"" values that do make a difference. May we all be so transformed.",1320796800,3,916,4.579268292682927
4698447,3,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America put the finishing touches on a triumphant summer for Marvel that included hits Thor and X-Men: First Class and successfully bridged the gap to next summer's much anticipated Avengers movie. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances. Even if Captain America wasn't your favorite comic hero, chances are you'll have a pretty good time with this movie.",1320710400,2,911,5.204081632653061
4698448,5,B005GYJPYW,"It is now obvious that when you want a super-hero film that takes place during World War II, the man to turn to is Joe Johnston.  First the highly underrated  ""The Rocketeer"" in the summer of 1991, and now the best super hero film of the summer of 2011.  Most people know the story of Steve Rogers, the 98 lb weakling turned into a  super-soldier by a scientific experiment. Created by the legendary Jack Kirby and Joe Simon before the U.S. officially entered the war, this film is fun and exciting from start to finish.  Chris Evans, the ""Human Torch"" from the Fantastic Four films is great both as 98 lb. Steve and super soldier Steve.  Tommy Lee Jones is a riot as a Pattonish Colonel that Captain America serves under.  British actress Hayley Atwell is beautiful in 1940's style make-up and hair design as the British officer assigned to the Captain America experiment who winds up being Steve's nominal love interest and Hugo Weaving is appropriately nasty as the Captain's nemesis, Red Skull.
As stated the action is fast and furious and the patriotic spirit of WW II is captured beautifully.  There is a nice patriotic musical number, ""The Man with the Plan"" starring the good Captain and a group of dancers probably representing the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, played during the Captain's war bonds tour.
The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are fine.  There are numerous not very long ""making of"" segments and one featuring the story of the Captain's origin.  There are deleted scenes and a much longer segment of the scene at the end where the Captain first meets Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury that is far better than the scene actually used in the film.  The music by Alan Silvestri is fine and the end-credits include patriotic posters, most of which were probably actually used during the war.  This just adds to the film's obviously patriotic feeling.
I looked forward more to ""Green Lantern"" last summer and greatly enjoyed it.  However I enjoyed this film more.  (If you enjoyed Director Johnston's work on this film, check out the previously mentioned ""The Rocketeer""  I'm sure you will enjoy that one as well.)
And now we can look forward to the good Captain joining Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and others in the ""Avengers"" film next May.
And if you haven't already seen the film in the movies, stay to the absolute end of the credits for more on the above.",1320710400,,2386,4.6746411483253585
4698449,5,B005GYJPYW,"Aside from the plot development, acting and (for me) the nostalgia factor, this movie was pure fun!!!  One of the most incredible things was was changing the skinny short Steve Rogers by hitting him with the ""Vita Ray"" (what a hoot!), that transforms him into Captain America.  Like I said, great acting, funny, top notch cast (must have been a HUGE budget!), great direction and writing, STAGGERING special effects...  Buy it!!",1320710400,,428,5.0
4698450,3,B005GYJPYW,"I thought that Joe Johnston was a good pick to direct Captain America. He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park-III/dp/B00003CXXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park III</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumanji/dp/B000031EGV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumanji</a>), so I figured that with Johnston at the helm for Captain America, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for Captain America sure made it seem like at least the action would be there, but ultimately I found Captain America to be very slow-moving and the weakest entry among the movies that have been introducing us to next year's Avengers.

I admit that I had a preconceived notion about Captain America way before the pre-Avengers movies even started to get made, and my preconceived notion was that Captain America was outdated and quite frankly boring. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimates/dp/0785110828/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimates</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimates-2/dp/0785121382/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimates 2</a>. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Captain America (and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B0034G4P8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>). Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books, and similarly I gained an entirely new respect for Captain America because of Millar's books. The integrity of Millar's delivery of Captain America is somewhat still in place with Johnston's Captain America; there's just something about Johnston's that made him into more of a campy, corny kind of character that left me unsatisfied by the end of the film.

Captain America is a bizarro period piece mostly set in the early 40s that documents Captain America's making and rise. So I think that the campy, corny part of his personality that Johnston instilled was deliberate and meant to suggest it was sort of the natural disposition of a lot of people back then. But for me it just came across as rather droll. Surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are gravely underused in Captain America.

Look, if you want to see the birth of Captain America and keep the continuity of the introduction of the Avengers prior to next year's Avengers blockbuster, I certainly don't recommend skipping Captain America. But if you want to read a MUCH better story with Captain America in a key role read Millar's books.",1320710400,,3061,6.163934426229508

4698453,1,B005GYJPYW,"This is a truly dreadful portrayal by the studio of a Marvel Comics icon from my youth. The plot (if you can find one) is banal, but even worse is the 3D presentation. The 3D presentation is bizarre. Imagery: it's completely out of perspective. It's like characters are digitally 'pasted' on to backgrounds, apparently many feet apart, when the perspective should be a fraction of that. Weird and amateurish. Software gone mad, no human control or common sense. There are scenes with a long arm or other object pointing right out of the screen, for no reason. Its sepia colors, no doubt to  give the impression of the 1940s WWII, are odd. In comparison to other Blu Ray 3D releases recently, this doesn't hack it - at all.",1320710400,9,722,4.640625

For the record, I am not a comic book fan and I did not really know the backstory to the Captain America story - and I had no trouble following the plot, as some others said they did.  The acting wasn't exactly A+, but I didn't think it was THAT bad.  I enjoyed the story, and I in particular liked the villain.  In reality, it was a gift for my husband and he loved it, so I was satisfied with that.  I myself also enjoyed it; I am sure I will watch it again.  As I said, I was not crazy about the ending; I take it that they were trying to set up a follow up movie, but it felt a bit awkward and disjointed from the rest of the film.

With the world audiences having been caught in the webs of spiders and roller-coastered by the flights of supermen, this (comparitively) tame Captain pales in comparison. Even the gadgets are unimpressive. Batman has far more resources than the venerable US army, I surmise. When a super hero film is shorn of extreme ""hero-giri"", it fails to excite. This movie has not used the special-effects technology available in today's times to its advantage. Or maybe the producers were saving bigger action for a sequel. Whatever the reason/s, the movie is average. Yes, the only thing which is amazing is the shrunk avatar of the main lead, before he is transformed into captain-america. One is forced to think if the smaller guy is the real life step-motherly-fed sibling of Chris Evan? Thats where they have used technology to good effect. Overall a passable movie.

4698458,5,B005GYJPYW,"This is the best comic book movie to be released this summer. That is what it is, a comic book movie. It does not surpass that level but nobody ever said it had to. While not a Spider-man 2 or Dark Knight it fits in well as a first entry in an inevitable series. Perhaps not the fun, turn the formula on its head, film that Iron Man was, it is still an excellent comic book film that manages to have developed characters and a story actually propelled by plot rather than CG sequences (I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and 3). Still, even with all its positive attributes the film might've been largely a one time viewing for me, that is, if it hadn't been for Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter.

My personal, and largest, issue with comic book movies has been their seeming inability to cast memorable and talented women in the leading lady spot. While the leading lady role has frequently been nothing more than a damsel in distress (other than perhaps in team up movies such as X-men), something unfortunately true even of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight films, here we find that is not the case. Peggy Carter is a female character who stands out amongst the many comic book movie female characters. She is strong willed, independent, can handle herself, never asks for help, doesn't take any crap and does it all in a period where women were undeniably treated as less than men. She does all these things yet she can still walk into a bar in the middle of the film wearing a red dress that leaves everyone at a loss for words.

Even better than Peggy Carter's character, and the reason I named the actress rather than the character in my review title, was the casting of Hayley Atwell in the role. The character could have become something much different without a capable actress to play the balance of tough yet feminine. Worse it could have been filled by some less capable big name actress for box office draw. For years in comic book movies I have either dreaded or at best barely stomached the casting of female leading roles.

Kirsten Dunst had her moments in the Spidey films but then would come the time when she had to be kidnapped and scream and holler for help, she also always needed a man in her life, if not Peter then another stand in to take his place. Batman Begins casting of Katie Holmes always seemed strange to me, why in a film full of lower status but credible actors would Nolan cast a more household name with much less credibility? Whatever the reason, she played the part but it is not the role anyone remembers from that film. The same goes for the sequel, in which I had high hopes Maggie Gyllenhaal would make welcome changes to the previously pitchy character, unfortunately I dare say that Rachel Dawes only became more helpless and became the one negative to be found in The Dark Knight.

More recently I was disappointed to find Gwenyth and Natalie both playing supposed strong women but one (Pepper Potts) who is subordinate to a man who treats her badly and still needs to be saved in the end and the other (Jane Foster) fairly shallow and school girlish overall.

While Jane only likes Thor at first because of his muscles, Peggy meets Steve Rogers/The Cap when he is a ninety pound weakling. We see her first tinge of interest in him when he is still this small, all based on his philosophies on fighting and dating. It is this established connection before he becomes a perfect male specimen that cements the story and keeps us truly engaged. Peggy and Steve truly bring out the best in eachother and actually share a common bond of struggling to break free from their respective stereotypes that allows the audience to believe in their relationship, one that is actually formed out of friendship first. The film is great and a wonderful starting point for a series, the ending is unique if only a plot device required for the Avengers tie in and I truly can't wait to see where they take Captain America in his sequel. He has by the end of the film, especially thanks to Peggy Carter, become quite a different hero with quite a different chip on his shoulders than any we have yet to see.

So I have wondered why comic book movies don't cast relatively unknown actresses to play these parts and allow them to really create a character. Finally Captain America has done just that with the lovely Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and I hope we see much more of it in future comic book films. The saddest part of Captain America and perhaps the thing that compells me to want to see it again Repeated times is that based on the ending it is very unlikely we will see the fantastic Peggy Carter/Hayley Atwell in all her glory in any of the sequels. They have some big shoes to fill when they inevitably try to create a Sharon Carter character, let's hope they take cues from however it was that they came to choose Hayley.

**By the way, I would like it if Hayley or someone like her played Wonder Woman for DC, brits are already playing supes and batman might as well fill in the big three with a third, and let's not only have a more obscure actress with talent but one who can fill out the costume properly, no stick thing actresses such as when people were rallying for Megan Fox to play WW.",1320537600,3,5225,4.476390346274921

I really love this movie, in an age when so many movies are so overdone, this is a simple but powerful movie. This might be why there are some people complaining that they were bored. Although, the crowd that we saw the movie with was on its feet cheering at the end of the movie. A simple movie about good versus evil. A hero who is intelligent, modest, and compassionate. The idea of fighting for something larger than yourself or for your own interests, and making sacrifices. To see a crowd of mostly young people cheering enthusiastically at the end of a film you would take your children or grandchildren to see was about as satisfying as the film itself.

This is a contrast to movies like the last Transformers move (Dark Side of the Moon), where the action is so overdone it seemed like the planet was destroyed five times over before Sam Witwicky saves the day, after surfing falling buildings with hardly a scratch.

If you like seeing movies try to outdo each other with over-the-top action and special effects - this movie isn't for you. If you can't enjoy a movie unless the plot is highly complex, you should skip this one. Although I still think it would be a pity to miss such a beautiful story of pure goodness and courage.

4698462,4,B005GYJPYW,"These past few years we have been repeatedly smacked over the head with super hero movies. Not that it's a bad thing since I admit I have enjoyed just about all of them so far. As someone that has never been into comic books I have been able to go into these types of movies with little to no expectations other than what I had seen from the previews.

Chris Evans (Fantastic Four 1, Fantastic Four 2, and Sunshine) is cast as the hero Captain America. I was a little resistant to his selection for the role at first due to him playing the Human Torch previously, but at the same time knew that he had the talent to make Captain America all that it could be. For the first quarter of the movie we see underachieving Steve Rodgers do everything in his power to get accepted into the Army. There is a very good bonus feature that describes the several different ways the studio was able to make the pre-hero Rodgers look so realistic. All the sets we see in this movie make it feel very authentic and fresh. It really looks like a lot of effort was put into making everything from the costumes, vehicles, and tech gadgets look believable for that time period (especially the Red Skull and his car!). From what I have read and been told there were some liberties taken by the studio that don't necessarily sync this movie up the comic books. From my vantage point I can't say I found any glaring problems with the movie from start to finish and was impressed with the way Stark Industries got plenty of face time.

Overall, I think the casting set this movie up to be very successful. The acting is about as good as you could hope for in a comic book adaptation movie. It has plenty of heart, action, and just enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light from time to time. The bonus features were pretty good and plentiful. My only complaint would be that the Blu Ray transfer is not as sharp as I hoped for, definitely not as sharp looking as The Green Lantern or Thor. In the end this is a fun-filled couple hour escape from reality that should please most fans. 4.5/5",1320451200,,2068,4.3549222797927465
4698463,2,B005GYJPYW,"I was so looking forward to watching this on my new tv.  I missed it while it was in the movies.  I'm so angry that I actually paid so much for the DVD.  My wife and I enjoy comic book movies, but this one was a stinker.  We were so bored that we thought the movie lasted three hours.

It's not like the actors did a poor job, I think it was the plot and/or the writing.  Maybe I should view it again, which I'm sure I will.  This could have the same effect on me as did The Fifth Element.  Hated it the first time I seen it, but liked it after watching it a couple more times.  I'm slow like that.

4698464,4,B005GYJPYW,"I was never very interested in Captain America, thinking he's just a strong guy who waves around a boomerang type shield. I now see what the ""fuss"" is about and this movie has turned me into a fan. I have seen quite a few movies starring Chris Evans and this is probably the best acting I have seen from him. The rest of the cast is very talented and don't disappoint. The storyline was easy to follow and enough action to keep my interest. It also seemed to blend very well with the other Marvel movies (the biggest one obviously being Iron Man). I'm not well versed in the comic book world but overall, I think this was a great movie and I'm glad I finally watched it.",1320451200,2,670,4.2421875
4698465,4,B005GYJPYW,"I should probably start off by mentioning that I have never read any comic books related to Captain America, so I had no prior knowledge about the characters in the movie. I honestly didn't really know whether I'd like the movie or not when I bought it. I usually like watching movies based on comic book superheroes, even if I haven't read the comic books beforehand. I guess I just like the idea of watching comic book characters come to life in these types of movies. Sometimes, I decide to check on this site to see what the average rating is for a movie before buying it. In this case, I decided to get it on a whim instead. After having seen it, I have to say that I definitely enjoyed watching it for the most part. Due to the fact that I hadn't read any Captain America comic books prior to seeing the movie, the ending definitely surprised me more than a little bit. Chris Evans did a pretty good job in his role as Captain America. I remembered him from when he was in the Fantastic Four movies a few years ago. Hugo Weaving was convincing as the evil villain of the movie. When the villain of a movie can get an audience member to want to see them vanquished by the good guy, it means that the actor is doing his job, and doing it well. This movie left me wanting to know what will happen next in the story because of what happened at the end. I don't say that about every movie. Then again, not every movie I watch has an ending to it that leaves room for a sequel. Suffice to say that if you are looking for a good action movie that can hold your attention and doesn't have a huge amount of gore (there is a little, but not very much), look no further than this movie.",1320451200,,1681,4.1753846153846155

4698469,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.

`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.

This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.

This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.",1320364800,,1711,4.340625
4698470,4,B005GYJPYW,"This is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Great special effects, good acting, and a decent plot make it worthy.  Could it have been done better?  Only in the plot.  I won't go into details since the plot has been told by many previous reviews, but the ending could of been done better.  I understand Marvel wanted to bridge the gap into the 21st century and have Captain America be a part of The Avengers, but the ending was not as good as expected.  That though is being picky on my part.  I enjoy Superhero movies and Marvel and DC have done an overall good job on bringing their characters to the big screen.  This movie is no exception.  It is great fun to watch and I recommend it to any Superhero fan!",1320364800,,703,4.265151515151516
4698471,5,B005GYJPYW,"I rented Captain America through Amazon Rental and what is to complain about? The $3.99 is reasonable, I like watching it this way because I don't have to handle dirty videos, the last video I rented had something sticky on it like red candy and it stopped working so I had to go back to the store and get another copy, and the movie theater was uncomfortable because the seats were dirty with grime and were sweaty smelling. The reviews were good for this movie and that was a decision-maker for renting, and I was not disappointed. The movie action and music were not overbearing like some others I've seen, there was good quality action and plot and not too long and it kept moving, Chris was perfect for this role and it was amazing how they presented him in two different body forms and sizes. Excellent supporting actors and the ending was superhuman cool.",1320278400,,862,4.567741935483871
4698472,2,B005GYJPYW,"I have no idea how people thought this movie was any good. I guess its a tale of two viewers. The average viewer and the comic book geek. I could see how the average theatre goer just wanted something entertaining and adventurous, which is all good. Who doesn't right. But when you watch any movie don't people want the most realistic approach to a character as possible? I mean for one Cap't America isn't mr funny man. Too many corny one liners from him. Plus, its set in WWII and im sure there wasn't too many people telling jokes then. He takes every approach in a serious matter. Second, he breezes through the movie beating up everyone and never brought to his knees. The final fight scene is one of the worst ive ever seen. Chris Evans was terrible as the Torch in FF and he's even a worse capt america. He's the leader of the Avengers and the movie should have taken notes from the Band of Brothers on how to film WWII scenes. The cartoon style filming didn't cut it for me. I'm not keeping my hopes high after seeing the Avengers trailer, thats for sure. So in my view, bad acting and filming. Definitely more of a kids movie.",1320278400,,1135,4.3584905660377355
4698473,4,B005GYJPYW,"The second half of this movie definitely redeems itself from a beginning that is a bit sluggish and from a story that is a ret-con from it's comic book origins. In the end, the only real dissapointing thing about the movie is the way it introduced James ""Bucky"" Barnes, Captain America's sidekick. In my opinion, this should have remained more true to the comics. Nonetheless, this is a Captain America movie. And while Chris Evans didn't come across as Cap-like in the first half of the movie, by the end I found myself warming up to his take on the role. As an action film, this movie works well. The effects and battle scenes are well done. I was particularly impressed with the way Cap uses his shield in this fight scenes. This is even difficult to get right in the comics, but they got it right in this movie. There is a good villain, the Red Skull, and there is a more than satisfactory ending. As I stated in my title, the very end of this movie does a great job to set up for the next Marvel film, The Avengers.",1320278400,,1020,4.317708333333333

Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in ""bigness"" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides ""The Avengers"", which looks very promising!",1320278400,2,752,4.4963503649635035

I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Captain America for its good clean image, pro-America plot lines, and real muscle.  Sure, it's fun to see a super hero beating up the bad guys with special powers, but Captain America is all about muscle, pride, and determination.  What more could you want from an American film set during WWII?

I loved Chris Evans in Fantastic Four, but was a bit afraid that cocky attitude his characters tend to have on screen would bleed over to this film.  Thankfully it did not.  Chris is the epitomy of that wholesome American loving soldier in looks and attitude.  Good job! I was amazed at the special effects to make him look small in the beginning as Rogers, and immediately had to Google it to see how it was done.

If you want to see a good ""super hero"" film with lots of real action, but no over the top fake-looking special effects, and just a tad bit of romance, then Captain America is for you.  And its a great lead-in to the Avengers movie due out next Spring!",1320192000,5,1176,4.256756756756757

4698479,5,B005GYJPYW,"I love comics. Always have, always will. I doubt that anyone could beat me in Batman trivia. Or Green Lantern. Or Swamp Thing. Anything Darkhawk.... Okay, so DH is Marvel. Anyway. What I have always loved in comics is man's ability to overcome enormous tribulations without relying on so called 'super powers'. Knowing this, you can imagine how bad I wanted to see Captain America. Despite the fact that I am a DC fanboy.

Marvel's latest addition to what will be the Avenger's film is a knock out of the park. The sense of the Cap before the super-soldier program is amazing. There's this 80-pound version of Chris Evans and he's the best. Loyal and morally strong, with a love of the American ideals. The transformation into a super soldier is amazing; he is shown 'over-using' his new body and all but trips himself up because he actually realize he's running faster on foot than the cars drive around him. His innocent patriotism becomes an unstoppable force, and it makes you believe that one man can indeed make a difference.

I have to give a nod to Alan Silvestri's score for the film. It strikes a strong central theme that fits the balance between patriotism and honest strength and it sounds authentic to the mid-40's. Well done, good sir.

Cinematography is marvelous. Together with the stages and authentic vehicles and storefronts, we actually feel that we've been engaged with WWII hanging over our heads.

The BD is just as awe-inspiring. We have the Holy Grail of sound - a 7.1 Sound track; it's only the 2nd I've ever seen. We get several featurettes, all showing various technical tid-bits and it is not the same point-counting drivel some folk have thrown together on DVD or BD. They manage to provide the tech talk with their own appreciation of the source material. There's a short film featuring Agent Coulson which demands automatic laughter at the most unsuspected details. Worth the $25 of the Blu-Ray 2-disc. It's gonna be a classic, mark my words.

I'm watching the film now with the commentary. Already it seems less 'stuffy' than most; a mixture of technical talk with fond memories.  >>>EDIT: the commentary is actually pretty fun stuff, pointing out Easter eggs and hinting towards things to come. Alas, they provided no commentary on the post-credits scene. Not that they needed to; it pretty much speaks for itself.>>>

But the best part is, we have seen some bit of what Marvel has in store for us. The Avenger's film is going to break a few benchmarks in modern film making. DC may have the Animated features each a tight and solid entry for the DCU, but beyond the Batman franchise, and possibly Green Lantern, DC just doesn't match the steam behind Marvel's power. I'm still holding out for a Flash feature film.

I'll probably catch some flames from this review. But I have to be honest and objectionable. Marvel is reminding me of a time in my youth when I didn't know DC Comics existed. And the Avengers were one of my favourite titles way back then. I'm glad to see anything positive come from anything comic-book related. Makes the years of living as a geek somewhat tolerable.

4698483,4,B005GYJPYW,"For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of nave idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.

From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.

At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as ""somewhat bittersweet"" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.",1320105600,,2265,4.817480719794345

4698486,5,B005GYJPYW,"I saw this film last night. Before I get to my review I want to address the editorial review on this page, which said that there wasn't a link from the period this story takes place to the future when Captain America is part, or leader, of the Avengers. That reviewer evidently did not see the very first and very last scenes in the film, which explain the process by which Captain America is frozen, then thawed in the future.

Anyway (sorry for the spoiler but I had to get that out the way because I don't think it was fair of the reviewer to overlook these scenes), I confess that it's been a very long time since I had such a good time on a superhero film. The reason I enjoyed this film is because, for one of the rare times with these types of films, its human elements didn't take a back seat to the special effects. In fact, it was the other way around. The acting was very good as was the story, as believable as a story so preposterous as its presented, can be.

Basically, the story takes place during WW2 and a rogue general in one of Hitler's divisions called Hydra has acquired an ancient energy source that has enabled him to construct the ultimate weapon. The only hope for the Western axis is to develop ""super soldiers"" starting with a short pencil-neck recruit named Steve Rogers who volunteers to be a guinea pig that will amplify both his physical and also his moral attributes.

This is one very good film, far and away the fourth best superhero this decade behind Batman Begins, the Dark Knight, and Spider Man. They really took time getting into character development, it wasn't just Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am straight to the action, but there was a real story here and not just enough to justify special effects later on. I really appreciate the film's attempt to recreate that era, to make the film feel alien enough for me to believe that it happened in another time. As usual, both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific, Weaving as the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee as the hard-bitten military guy. Like I said, this film is more story than action even though the action and cgi effects are very good in this film, and always feel appropriate for the situations in which they are used. I like the sepia look of the human parts of the movie and how this look contrasts with the scenes showing Captain America doing his thing. This is a great primer for next year's Avengers film and I hope that the creative team who put together Captain plays a part in that film. Must see.",1320019200,3,2505,4.465065502183406

4698491,2,B005GYJPYW,"First of all, I saw this in theatres. I did not buy the blu-ray version. I don't know extra stuff you get for blu-ray. That being said, if the movie is no good (which is the main reason why you would even buy this) then its all for not. Well, how can I put it? This movie is no good.

I was really looking forward to this movie and went with a buddy to see it opening day. I was really hoping captain america would save the summer from so called blockbusters that sucked (im looking at you green lantern). It's very hard not use the word bland when it comes to this movie, but thats exactly what it is. It is not a bad movie in the regular sense, but i ceases to do much or take any chances. Some may qualify that as bad. Putting all semantic discussions aside, this movie is frequently boring and sometime down right comical for all the wrong reasons. It was directed by Joe Johnston. Hes a done a few good movies that I enjoyed from my childhood like Jumanji. I was hoping he would keep it interesting, but fails. This movie follows the super hero story cliche without missing a beat. A loser nobody finds himself blessed with new incredible abilities, must overcome personal obstacles, have a fleeting meeting with villain only to fight again at the end and don't forget a love interest thrown in for good measure. Of course, these are how all superhero stories must be told. However, the recent SPiderman and the Batman films have done this so much better. In the batman movies, there is a real struggle going on with bruce wayne. Spiderman 2 also creates an interesting conflict among the characters. All of this is absent in Captain America. Worse than this is the amount of time it takes for the movie to get going. The film doesn't really get going until the second half with only one fight scene up to that point. After an early chase scene after Steve Rogers gets his powers, he is sent to sell war bonds instead of fighting the germans. Apparently, the military thought this would be a better use of a super soldier, to send him around doing song and dance routines to build up moral. This feels like such a waste of time. Finally, the movie eventually starts, but lets you down again. The majority of the action scense are too short and cheesy. Captain America has no problem going behind enemy lines and sneaking into a german base hiding american pow's. A few quick punches and he is inside. Remember that action montage during the commercials? That is the same thing in the movie. That does not take place in any kind of actual fight scene. In the movie, the same montage is used to speed up the story to get to more important parts. Here, Captain America has become more famous and goes around busting up german locations.

Not to mention, they totally blew having Hugo Weaving in this movie. They give him nothing to do other than to look angry and brood over the magical blue ancient Nordic orb. This is a glowing rock that has magical properties. The Hydra (Nazi sub group) are trying to somehow harness the energy to of course make a super weapon and take over the world..................sigh. I never read the comics, but i assume this is a part of it. Nevertheless, it just could not look any more silly on screen.

Thus, in captain america, we have a movie that has sub par action sequences, cheesy humor, an unexciting plot, and an underutilized villain. I can't really even recommend renting this. Its just not that exciting. As I said, the action scenes never go on long enough and there is too much boring plot filler in between. For some reason, it is highly popular right now at Redbox. You may have to wait awhile to see it. However, definitely do not buy this even on DVD. You will never watch it more than once.",1320019200,4,3743,4.445414847161572

4698493,5,B005GYJPYW,"Hello all
I recently purchased the Captain America:The First Avenger DVD and let me say it did not disappoint. First off i am not going to tell you the story if you want to know that go to wiki or marvel, but to put it plainly the story behind this movie is very good, and has many, many references to the comics both to Captain America, as well as other heroes. Bucky, and the howling commandos are all here and his main foes The Red skull and Arnum Zola are very well acted and brought to life on screen. While i did not like the way Captain America, and Red skull fight ended at the end. I think it was appropriate to set the stage for his return. Tommy Lee Jones does an incredible job as Colonel Philips, and Peggy Carter is brought to life very well by Hayley Atwell. Hugo Weaving's Portrayal of Red Skull is spectacular, but the one who steals the screen is Chris Evans, many including me were concerned he could not go from the playboy of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies, to the hero we know in Captain America, i now can say i was wrong and he did incredible. The features on the DVD are kinda slim but i have heard there are more on the Blu-ray edition. The one most will want to see is the Avengers Assemble section which details how the avengers get together and most of the links that brought them together from the previous movies, other than that there is commentary by Joe Johnson, as well as outfitting the hero which discuss how the suit and shield and the costumes were made.

 also on the disc are trailers for the sega game, Avengers:Earth Mightiest Heroes tv show, Transformers:DOFM, and Super 8. All and all a great movie and one for anyone but as a Captain America fan for many years, I myself loved it and it really set the stage for the Avengers(just look at the After credits scene) now on to the Avengers

4698494,2,B005GYJPYW,"First, read the IMDB page long list of goofs (I know there's even more!). Very entertaining and informative.
Negatives:
Some background on the energy source would have made the story more coherent.
More of an explanation as to how all the  high tech gadgetry came about. A cop out to comic book fans who don't like to think while being entertained.
A more developed plot sequence on how the various HYDRA labs were to be attacked rather than just show up out of nowhere and start firing away. Again bowing to a certain comic book audience demographic.
Roles and acting such as Jones' character shows he tediously stuck in an actor's rut. Usual token roles again for Asians and blacks and the overdone female role portrayed by Atwell as romantic interest and tough girl just seemed tossed into the plot to satisfy both the male comic book audience and to widen the demographic viewer profile all for remunerative reasons.
Positives:
Evans portrayal of the Cap was good, but I'm not sure which body was his and which was morphed in.
Fairly good quality and not yet overly overboard dominance in the use of CGI - just enough to create a good fantasy atmosphere. They did seem to borrow props and scenes from The Thing and Sky Captain ... amongst others.
The story tie in with WWII was integrated with appropriate humor and where appropriate, seriousness. Even though there's boxes of old comics to draw from I think the script people did a good job although less of a comic book feel would have helped the movie.",1319932800,2,1509,4.672932330827067
4698495,2,B005GYJPYW,"As a fan of action films, this one is disappointing; to me the super fake 'Hail' cries, English spoken with a German accent, poorly choreographed war, battle and fight scenes are just like seeing a bland person with a big hairdoo, or pouring a load of salt on under- or over-cooked food.  Save the funds, and see it on cable, or borrow a friend's copy.  The action is mostly trite, the acting and storyline seems massaged more than Kobe beef, and I actually stopped it 32 min. before it ended; I'll watch the rest today, cocktail in hand. The writers and director could've studied Spiderman a bit more, in order to understand what it takes for a filmgoer to give a damn about the character, how he develops, and what he says; this is some overcooked, watery pasta with tons of salt.
My brothers and I collected and read Marvel comics since the early 1970s and collected Capt. America and most others; I get the ideas they're going after, it just the film isn't well made and isn't fun. I really think they director messed up on details in the movie. I do not feel passionate enough to spend more time decrying it's dullness.",1319932800,2,1124,4.504901960784314
4698496,3,B005GYJPYW,"I wanted to like ""Captain America"" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years.  The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential.  Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film.  Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend ""Bucky"" much more.  The same is true of the villains--they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.

The special effects are good, and I applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original ""Captain America"" story.  I just think that this one could have been done better.  RJB.",1319932800,9,792,4.574468085106383
4698497,5,B005GYJPYW,"Just finished watching it and both my wife and I thought it was pretty good and lots of fun. I grew up reading all the Marvel comics back in the early sixties (I still have a few score of them) and could relate and appreciate the effort put into this film.
While several changes were made to modernize Cap, some things were left as they were intended. Lots of action, nice character development (once again, with more films in mind), a great blend of evil characters - the Red Skull is one of the more fiendish baddies ever, right next to Dr Doom and the hordes of Hydra were nicely done as were the giant sets, massive aircraft etc...
Great production efforts, a good mix of WWII related action and Hydra-inspired weaponry and the right mix of explosions that didn't overwhelm the storyline.
As next year's Avengers epic is due summer of 2012 which could produce the biggest film series since 'Star Wars' if done correctly. The money is there, the fan base is there and the potential for some terrific action sequences is right around the corner.
As for Captain America, pretty enjoyable, my wife is from the Philippines and had never heard of Cap before enjoyed the efforts and asked me all sorts of questions about him. It was also great seeing the quick cameo of the great Stan Lee in this one also.
Good for it. If you ever read the Marvel comics, do yourself a favor and rent or buy this one, not too shabby and lots of fun to watch.",1319932800,,1439,4.433962264150943
4698498,2,B005GYJPYW,"Yep, next to someone amazingly pretty you very well might be ugly in comparison.  Here's the rub with this movie, it does somethings great.  Somethings look great, its close enough to the real story, but there's just enough things that aren't exactly on the money to ruin it and make the ugly bits really ugly.  The characters just don't have enough charisma and what ends up happening is a watered down mollified version of what was a very violent era.  It's more childish than a cartoon.  I love cartoons, when they are done well.  In all what you get isn't a clever adaption of how a real man can become IRON MAN, but rather G.I.JOE meets WWI.  As an example, we never get to see what the limits of Steve's new powers are, why is he so good at bouncing a shield... it just shines as a movie that got a lot right and needed more polish and was only mediocre compared to what could have been.  Blah blah blah, bitch and moan, I know.  Take it with a grain of salt, the movie may be aright for you, I own it and thought to myself... I should have bought THOR instead.  Take that internet.",1319846400,,1088,4.263414634146342
4698499,3,B005GYJPYW,"I'll admit Captain America had an interesting premise but the delivery was pretty average.  There were a lot of explosions and fight scenes and not enough back story or even tension within the characters.  Schmidt wanted world domination.  That's it.  He was too simple.  Rogers was too straight up of a good guy to have much depth.  And agent Peggy Clark was not very interesting either.  To put it straight:  I became more interested in my Cheddar flavored popcorn than the movie.  It could have been much better. --Sherry Gripman, Author",1319846400,10,540,4.846153846153846
4698500,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was action packed and very entertaining. I don't think it could have been done any better than what it is. The computer generated graphics seem to transition to the reaction of the characters smoothly. Liked the vaporizing lazer guns that turned it's victims in to dust, real funny. For some reason, the energy blast from those lazer guns reminded me of G.I. Joe. I can't wait to see what the Avengers movie will be like. Hopefully, there will be a series of films for the Avengers story line. The previews I have seen so far don't have Wolverine, Spiderman, Black Panther, or the Hulk. I could be wrong, but I didn't see those characters. Just have to wait to find out who is actually in the movie when it gets released next year.",1319846400,,742,4.503703703703704
4698501,5,B005GYJPYW,"Had lots of fun watching this! Loved the feisty-chick--love interest(Hayley Atwell). Had enough witty dialog to hold my interest...
...And the dumb-asses programming Amazon's website insist on at least 20-words, so I'm including this!",1319846400,,234,5.911764705882353
4698502,5,B005GYJPYW,"I never read the original Captain America comic from the 40's, but considering this is probably the first of at least one sequel for ""Cap"" I think the film was very well done. Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four film. It's a little light on ""Cap"" action, but the story is pretty easy to follow. Great FX and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans and also gets us pumped for next summer's Avengers film, but purist may find flaws I didn't notice or care about.

The three disc 3-D/Blu Ray/DVD combo has some interesting extras making of etc. and an excellent looking Blu Ray transfer.",1319846400,3,671,4.368
4698503,5,B005GYJPYW,A feel good movie. I enjoyed it. Makes you want to get up & cheer for Captain America & forget about everything else.,1319846400,,117,4.130434782608695
4698504,2,B005GYJPYW,"I was all set to like this film but found it wanting. No one could have taken Captain America seriously in the 40's let alone today. The thin plastic or cardboard shield on his back, far from being intimidating or as protection was ludicrous. And how did the director, Joe Johnston not know that the army was not integrated in those days?But then again one shouldn't expect relevance or getting history right these days!",1319846400,,420,4.6891891891891895
4698505,5,B005GYJPYW,"This movie was much better than I expected.  The characters are excellent and nuanced, not just comic book cutouts.  The hero, for example, starts out being a physical weakling, but he has admirable heart and unstoppable determination.  When he becomes a physical superhero, the qualities that make you love him do not change; he just becomes a winner with much bigger obstacles to overcome.  Stanley Tucci's character is lovable and well played; this is my favorite of all the characterizations I've seen him in, and I feel his talent shines forth in this role.  It was sad that the character exited so early in the film, although the filmmakers managed to keep his spirit alive throughout the film, so he is not forgotten.  The action is outstanding, even for me; I am not particularly drawn to action films.  It keeps moving, and it is not just a rehash of all the action films you've seen before; it has a few interesting twists.  I also liked the hero's friend, although his character was not developed as much.  Visually, the movie is gorgeous, with a variety of scenery and excellent camera work.  The characters are more real and warm because of the way they are filmed, and the action is equally more riveting for the same reason.  Some of the scenes are breathtaking.  What really catapults a movie from mediocre to outstanding is how the characters are portrayed, and in this movie you care about the characters.  The ending is not a close-the-book-we're-done-forever ending, which suggests that they are already planning a sequel, and I am already planning to see it.",1319846400,,1579,4.825278810408922
4698506,1,B005GYJPYW,"I fell asleep on the movie.  I just kept saying I know that this movie is going to get better.  It never got better.  What about the 3D.  Even 3D can normally make a movie worth it.  I wish I had saved the $26.  Yes, I bought the 3D Combo at Amazon.  If I could return it, I would.  I love action and superhero movies in 3D.  I even love the Final Destination series because of the 3D and I don't seem to mind the acting or the fact that I always know how it will turn out.  This movie was a bit different.  Since I got the 3D TV there is very little content.  I have been collecting movies.  After purchasing a few movies that I did not like (Sanctum and The Nightmare Before Christmas), I thought that maybe I should stick to action films.  I really liked Drive Angry, Thor, and Green Lantern.  This one was was not all that good (acting, action, and 3D).  I would rent it if I could on Vudu.",1319846400,6,894,3.9943181818181817

4698509,4,B005GYJPYW,This is one of the best super hero movies of the Summer 2011- old fashion well crafted fun-it has a truly diabolical villain and some terrific action scenes.,1319760000,,157,4.642857142857143

4698511,2,B005GYJPYW,"What a disapointing movie. From the super Nazi to the Captain himself. The effects in the movie were quite good but the story and the acting was terrible. Even Tommy Lee Jones was a disapointment. That in itself says something about the screen play. What a weak tie in to Ironman with SL Jackson showing up in the end. So I am guessing there is an Ironman Captain America and the Hulk meet Captain jack Sparrow and harry Potter sequel heading our way, with a cameo appearance by Shrek.",1319760000,,485,4.46067415730337
4698512,1,B005GYJPYW,"There is no continuity in this movie, no explanations as to what is happening, just random action scenes. Add bad acting on top of that and very little character development aside from Captain America himself. The high ratings must be from fans of the comic book. Save your money and avoid this movie.",1319760000,6,301,4.69811320754717
4698513,5,B005GYJPYW,"I really loved this movie. I saw it in theaters in 3D, and then again in 2D and it was good both ways. I was so excited when i saw that it was out on video on demand. Out of all of the recent Super Hero movies that have come out recently Captain America is my favorite.",1319760000,2,269,3.736842105263158
4698514,5,B005GYJPYW,"I skipped seeing this at the theaters - I thought i would be a waste of time.  Then I saw on one of those 5"" seat-back screens on a flight to Denver. I was really surprised. The special effects, as expected, were amazing. The background of cap and his character development really added to the plot.  The Red Skull? Again, the movie pulled it off.

People that give this movie 1 or 2 stars don't get it.  Some parts are supposed to be cheesy and over the top! Tying in Iron Man's dad and all the little tidbits that are planted throughout the movie also help build the background for th Avengers. Although I still think ""Thor"" was the worst movie in decades, there's even a major tie-in to Odin.

This is a fun romp, does not take itself too seriously, and draws simple lines between good and evil.  The Red Skull is such a baddie, even the SS fears him! Cap is more American than the Man of Steel. Both owe their strength and powers to the same scientist, and even if they are not biologically related, they have a common genesis and ""father.""

This really is a must see for action hero fans!",1319760000,,1093,4.302439024390244
4698515,5,B005GYJPYW,"I think what I like the most about this movie and Cap is that he is a below average guy that was given a opportunity of a lifetime due to his will, courage and humilty he had inside him. The process he went through allowed all of these qualities to physically manifest. If you ever been the little guy that never gave up or back down, this movie really hits home in a lot of ways especially for me since I know Exactly what Rogers went through growing up. Cap isn't super rich intelligent or born with a mutation. He's just a good person who refused to give up on his dreams no matter what people told him. This is why Captain America is the best comic book hero movies that I have seen yet.",1319760000,,691,4.125925925925926
4698516,2,B005GYJPYW,"The first Spider-man film was much better then all the Marvel films that came after. The story pace was terrible, Capt. America starts out slow and about half way through speeds up as if the director ran out of time. So, plenty of action towards the end. Some of the special effects of Steve as a skinny weakling were terrible. Most noticeably when he is in the back seat of the car, his head was way to big, then he looked like a hobbit and then almost normal. It seems there is a mad rush to release these Marvel character films before the ""Avengers"" film release later this year. So, they are sacrificing quality, details, good writing, good editing and good acting for a quick buck. Thor and the Hulk were other examples of weak films. Chris Evans played Johnny (the human torch) in the Fantastic Four and now Capt. America??! There are ten thousand other actors to choose from!!!",1319760000,,884,4.53125
4698517,4,B005GYJPYW,"This long awaited film had been in development hell since 1997 which included lawsuit delays and a recent strike by the Writer's Guild of America. Chris Evans does a commendable job of playing the humble, heroic lad who will be turned into Captain America. Stanley Tucci gets one of the best speeches even though his time in the picture is limited. Hayley Atwell is one of the better love interests of the various Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is under used. The reference to MI6 was in correct as they were known as the SIS during WWII. Small nitpicking there, I admit.

There's a good deal of pulpy action and overall the story is good even if not great nor superlative. This film cost $140M to make and yielded a tad over $365M at the box office. A sequel is expected but THE AVENGERS (which will appear many of the Marvel Heroes) is going to be released beforehand. Critics were generally positive about this film. This picture was nominated for a number of awards and the 2011 Scream Awards gave it Best Superhero. As usual watch the credits to see a sneak peek at a future Avengers film.

BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan: Are you sure you know what you're doing? Steve Rogers: Yeah. I punched out Adolf Hitler 200 times. ///[flipping through Steve's file] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Where are you from Mr. Rogers?  Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities. Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file. Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis? Steve Rogers: Is this a test? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes. Steve Rogers: I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from. Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? /// [to Steve] Dr. Abraham Erskine: So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi's invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the...my people struggled. They...they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the... [he waves his hand] Dr. Abraham Erskine: And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, you...he says you will us strong. Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for a cult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. [flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine's formula and injects himself with it] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man. Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength. And knows compassion. Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.",1319673600,,3631,4.598765432098766

4698522,3,B005GYJPYW,"I reserved the movie on Redbox, made some popcorn, and watched the movie on my decent 50"" HD TV.  I really liked the special effects and it was easy to watch all the way though. The costumes were great and aesthetically pleasing. The only scenes that seemed insincere was after Bucky fell to his death, the dry eyes were unconvincing.  The scene with the snow & zip line was very deja vu, I'm pretty sure they used the same scene twice.  The typical conventional hollywood narrative of the protagonist's struggle between good and evil was brief and poorly developed...

But most of all, the entire movie felt like an advertisement to join the army.  From the time the protagonist tells how both his mother and father died while serving, to the time Red Head tempts him offering ""You could have the power of the Gods...No countries, One world!"" He's like ""Neer, I love America!"" Then in the end he makes a date which he would like to but doesn't intend to keep, giving the impression, ""A good soldier puts his country before romance.""

The whole cryogenicly frozen bit and missing his date was a horrible way to introduce the sequel.  The film had it's moments and it wasn't bad all the way through, hence the three stars.",1319673600,2,1221,4.599078341013825
4698523,4,B005GYJPYW,"Apparently the studios who make the media are idiots. They always make DVDs and Blu-Ray discs with sound levels that are grossly inadequate. What do they want, the consumer to run out and buy a sound system for their lousy movies that in most cases are not worth buying or seeing.

Have a state of the art Asus 3D laptop from Amazon with powerful speakers that I can barely hear when viewing Blu-Ray media and DVDs for that matter in Windows 7. It is not the media players (that are all inadequate) but the discs and the makers of laptops and the laptops sound scheme.

Wearing 3D glasses and ear phones is a real hassle on a laptop. How stupid are these studios and computer makers and MicroSoft? The answer is completely stupid and greedy.

Wait,there is more. The same applies to the newer plasma/LED/LCD TVs too. The TV makers give/provide a lousy sound system with your brand new TV.

Have two brand new LG 3D TVs from Amazon. The LED model's sound scheme is preposterously inadequate. At maximum volume I can barely hear the movie or TV over my house fan that sits on the floor about four feet from the LG LED TV thst sits on the floor.

These movies do not have in your face 3D effects. Captain America is a damn good movie with piss poor sound volume and nothing really in your face in 3D. My LED LG 3D TV can not overcome the inadequate sound nor can my Asus 3D Blu-Ray laptop from Amazon.

No consumer should have to spend additional hundreds of dollars to amplify the sound on their 3D TV or any new TV so they can hear it. The same for a laptop.

Studios need in your face 3D or they are going to go belly up.

Me, I want swords, fists, hatchets, bullets, rattle snakes uncoiling in my face on the screen. If you can not duck in a 3D movie then it ain't worth buying.

Captain America is a terrific movie. The lousy sound spoils it.

I know I will get a rebuttal from an employee at LG and Microsoft who will make an attempt to cover up their failings with things like it is strictly the media player (god forbid we deliberately screwed up). And of course crummy sound is to be expected. It is par for the course with the new TVs.

4698524,5,B005GYJPYW,"When I was a kid in the 60's, Batman, Spiderman, and Captain America were my 3 favorite superheroes, and remain so to this day.
No need to rehash the other great reviews, but IMO, what they got SO RIGHT here was the CHARACTER of Steve Rogers BEFORE he becomes Captain America.
Just as Batman Begins had us totally invested in Bruce Wayne BEFORE he ever donned the cape and cowl, Marvel works the same type of magic with Steve Rogers & THAT (along with stellar performances by ALL the supporting cast) is what makes this a truly great film.
After suffering through the badly done CA movies of the past, it is a dream fulfilled to see the character brought to life so fantastically By Chris Evans & Joe Johnston.
And the Red Skull--OMG--Incredible makeup & Hugo Weaving shines as always to make the character come across as one of the premiere villains of the Marvel Universe.
Finally--watch the deleted ending scene to see how they really SHOULD have ended the movie--THAT was my only gripe--the truncated ending in the theatrical version.
So, to sum up--FINALLY a GREAT, FUN & FAITHFUL rendition of Captain America.
Bring on the AVENGERS!

If you want to see a good superhero movie this the one for you or just a great action movie, this movie is great for you as well. It's close to the original comic book. If you're a fan of comics and movies. Give it a watch.",1319587200,4,325,3.7941176470588234
4698526,4,B005GYJPYW,"CAPTAIN AMERICA succeeds on so many levels that it is difficult to list them all.  But perhaps one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is that it treats the story in a time frame (WW II) that makes the 'supernatural heroes and villains' seem like operatically overstated normal people.  Opening the film with the superhero as a skinny nerdy but ethical and committed to do good kid and then see him transform into the hero of heroes who for once is doing good things because he cares about his fellowmen and his country makes for a feel good experience.  Dapple that with some old-fashioned 1940s Rockettes type dance sequences and keep the 'impossible gimmicks' down to a level of near credibility and you have a winner.

Quick, borrowed plot outline: 'It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins.'  And that about says it all.

Now, populate this story with a cast of first rate actors - Chris Evans as the magnificent Adonis built Steve Rogers/Captain America, Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine, Hayley Atwell as the sole 'love interest' Peggy Carter (Natalie Dormer does have a few seconds of screen time, too), Tommy Lee Jones as the military guy in charge, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best buddy, Dominic Cooper (a good guy), and a set of villains starting with Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Toby Jones as Dr. Zola, Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and then fill in the spare parts with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Michael Brandon, Martin Sherman  etc and the results are almost guaranteed to be good.

Joe Johnston directs the film in a propulsive fashion that takes time out for some humanity amid all the military derring-do and allows just the right amount of sarcasm and humor (courtesy the screenplay by  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and it all comes out 'just swell'. A terrific night's entertainment! Grady Harp, October 11",1319587200,,2648,4.932584269662922
4698527,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger, in my opinion, is this summer's top superhero movie. Heck, it might even be the best movie of 2011, period. Forget X-Men: First Class, Thor or Green Lantern. I'll have to say it, when noone else will, that this has to be Marvel's best, thus far.

The movie, basically, tells the origin of how Cap came to be with him going up against The Red Skull(who himself is a super soldier). There's plenty of action and the performances of the cast are top-notch and believable. Chris Evans plays Cap much better than he did as The Human Torch in Fantastic Four(which I always questioned anyhow). He's definitely more physical in this movie, with all the action he does.

However, where I find fault in the movie, The Red Skull doesn't get much screen time in the movie and-for that reason- he doesn't seem to be THAT serious of a threat to me. In the comics, The Red Skull is maniacal and is hellbent on threatening all humanity and making good on it. Like the original Batman movie(by Tim Burton), I was expecting the movie to portray the villain in as close a manner as he was in the comics but was disappointed that he wasn't. I can't find fault in Hugo Weaving, though. He did an excellent job as The Red Skull. Too, the conclusion of the movie seemed awkward and forced. I find fault in Director Joe Johnston, who seemed more concerned in laying down the origin and foundation for the upcoming Avengers movie. Not that that is a bad thing as it isn't but(..). With the sequel, however, he better 1-up everything...if he wants Cap to continue as a viable movie franchise. I suggest he looks to the Iron Man movies for inspiration or bow out while the gettin' is good and let someone else give it a shot. I know that's being critical but Cap deserves better.

Other than that, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. One of Marvel's best, if not THE best.",1319587200,,1898,4.495652173913044
4698528,4,B005GYJPYW,"Well done movie.  I don't know if I would say it was better than Iron Man, but it certainly was entertaining and enjoyable.

4698530,5,B005GYJPYW,"Hey all,

I watched this movie last night through Amazon Instant on my Panasonic Blu Ray using Vierra. As usual the video and sound quality was amazing.

The movie was very entertaining and I know it sounds strange but rather authentic. By authentic I am talking about the sets, characters, the era, etc. I do not know much about Captain America in general so I am not talking about it being authentic from that standpoint. it could be, I just do not know. It just appearred realistic to me considering the type of movie it is.

The acting was great and the cgi was not over done. I really thought it was a fun, action packed movie though I tgend to like things a little darker. I would have loved for this movie to have been rated r but I guess you can't have everything.

If you like this type of movie and if you liked Green Lantern you will love this. In my opinion it was much, much better than Green Lantern.

Thanks,

4698531,2,B005GYJPYW,"Honestly, I don't know what are this director's strengths besides his extensive background in VFX. I remember the first two Jurassic Park movies, just loved them. But when the third arrived in theaters I felt something was missing, didn't like it, yes there was more dinosaurs and things we never saw in the previous movies. It was a disappointing experience to say the least, completely lost interest in the Jurassic Park movies, and I think I was not even 14 by that time.

Well a few years later after being in school and having learned about story, script, storyboarding, lighting, camera, all you can name, I had a better understanding of film-making. By the way I am not saying I'm a genius or that I have the maximum authority regarding movies, this is my personal opinion. By this time I already knew the name of this director, already knew he was involved in the making of the great classic Star Wars movies.

Now to the point. For the last 10+ years I have enjoyed watching movie trailers in their maximum quality. The trailer for ""The Wolfman"" was great, I was so excited with the casting choice that I was desperate to see it. One day a friend comes and tells me the movie sucked, didn't want to believe him. Went to the theater and felt he was right, VFX were really really good, the movie itself: NO. I was glad to see they chose the practical way (make-up and prosthetics) for the wolfman, but in the end, not even the actors could save the movie, it was just.. too ""flat"", no real tension, no real motivation for the characters to do what they were doing.

And finally a year or more later, Captain America made his first appearance. Again, the story repeated itself when it comes to talk about the trailers. OK, I got movie, watched it, I almost fell asleep. But lets talk about what didn't disappoint me. First, I was not sure about Evans in the leading role, I'm glad to say he was good, not great but good. The rest of the actors did a good job too. Stanly Tucci's role felt too similar to that scientist's in the first Iron Man movie. I like Tucci's acting, specially in The Lovely Bones, which is a movie I had so much hope to be great... Anyway, VFX were great again, flawless, good cinematography. Now I think it comes to the script when I say I didn't like this movie that much. In my opinion, both Johnston and Evans could have done so much more with a better story. If you are teaming up Captain with the Howling Commandos, please make us feel that they are a team, that they are friends, that they care for each other. Someone else has said that the movie was a bit too long, I agree. You could have taken some time from those 2 hours and create a few sequences depicting their relationships, again, makes us feel that they were a TEAM. Like Transformers: the first movie showed us how well they played with each character but the last 2 movies, come on!!! most of the beloved characters were mute, so when a couple of them died, you wouldn't even care. Tell me I'm wrong when I say you DID feel sorry when Bumblebee was captured in the first movie. Now if I were to choose Johnston's best movie I would go for OCTOBER SKY, man!! that was a story with heart, it was inspiring, made me feel that I could achieve my goals no matter how far and difficult they seemed.

OK, so that's what I think when it comes to superhero movies, sometimes the script isn't good enough to make you feel REALLY attracted to the characters. I mean, Captain America was good but not enough to make me say: I wish I was that guy, I WISH I WAS CAPTAIN AMERICA. There are some movies that claim they are going to be ""bigger and grander"" in terms of a whole, unfortunately only a few succeed. Example? The Dark Knight, that movie really set a new standard in comic book movies. Iron Man 2, X-Men The Last Stand, Green Lantern, the latest Transformers films, they just forgot about developing a strong enough story and delivering us great villains and great story arks. They have tons of material they could use but sometimes they don't make the right choices. Did they make good money? Yes they did. Would I go to see them again in theaters? No, not even in 3D, which I think is not the greatest cinematic experience ever as some say. 3D should have stayed in theme attractions, for the kids, again NO OFFENSE MEANING to anyone.

4698532,5,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby back in the 1940's.  This was one creation that didn't involve Stan Lee.  Stan was responsible for the Captain's revival back in the mid- 1960's.  Ironically, a  1990 feature film version of the Captain prominently displayed Lee as the creator.

Captain America was one of the first to show the element of genetic engineering or ""super serum"".  The movie shows character actor Stanley Tucci as the German scientist who recruits Steve (Chris Evans) Rodgers for his experiment. The scientist wants a humble man who ""knows the value of strength"".  He wants a man who knows failure and weakness. He doesn't want an ego maniac who could turn into another Adolph.

On the other side of the globe, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)is preparing an attack on the U.S.A. and overthrowing Hitler.  The Cosmic Cube, which is a device in Stan Lee's 1960's Captain America revival, holds the key to his power.

The movie places all it's elements together at a fast pace. We even get to see Bucky, Cap's partner. Although in this version he doesn't have the costume.  The Howling Commandos make their appearance.  Sans Nick Fury in this movie, because he's alive in the 21st  Century.  Neal  McDonough has a few moments as the ever popular ""Dum, Dum Doogan, Fury's burly and  mustached right hand man. If you're a fan of the comics; you are in for a special treat.

That's the advantage of Marvel producing this film. I would have to say out of all the super hero movies this summer, this is the best of them all. You won't be disappointed if you're a die hard fan like myself.  The directors commentary provides lots of unknown information on how the film was made. You get to hear the director, Joe Johnston  talk about how the movie was developed from the ground up.  This has to be the most plausible version of the character I have seen.

There were four attempts to bring the Captain to the screen. In the 1940's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown. That version brought him into modern times. However the script was very slow to develop.  The 1990 feature film starred Matt Salinger  son of the famous author) as Captain America.  It also featured Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in supporting roles.  That too was also painfully slow to watch.  What the current producers see was the fact that fans want to see action on the screen. Not two hours of talking heads.",1319587200,2,2499,4.633257403189066
4698533,5,B005GYJPYW,"Where Iron Man 1 & 2 left you expecting more and the Fantastic 4 movies lacked the genuine feel of humanity and feeling overall complete this movie gets it right! the HULK '03 was way too bright and fake looking, Captain America seems more realistic with big explosions every so often.

I recently bought The Green Lantern and it was visually good, great graphics but it had no depth it seemed cheap but maybe I'm biased towards Marvel over DC.

I haven't gotten Thor yet skeptical of the story telling side of it more than anything. If you ignore the flaws in this movie ie. weapons issues functioning and ammo count etc and time period incorrect tires and phones the movie is wonderfully complete. It has more of the honest American working class heroe feel that will make it a classic in years to come. These characters (superheroes) make a outstanding genre that transfer well from print to screen.

You really need to give thanks to the man Stan Lee. Honestly I can't wait to see The Avengers. Should be good if it follows this pattern each movie gets better and better.

The only dissappointment is The Red Skull..... well lack there of. I wish it had more of the pure evil that made the NAZI's genuinely hated world wide with this character and tap into Weavings potential.",1319587200,3,1280,4.600877192982456

4698537,4,B005GYJPYW,"I have read some of the negative reviews of this movie and for the most part it's from people with the same complaints I have heard about other hero movies. Not enough action, characters not developed, not true to the comic, badly cast, and so on. I swear some of them just copy and paste their comments into any movie and then edit the title to match the film. By the time the review is over they have come off as either the ultimate comic book aficionado or William F. Buckly doing movie reviews.

You cannot expect a comic book to magically come to life exactly as the written in said book. With the history, horrific amount of retcons, and multitude of different books/interpretations by different authors it simply is not possible. Movie goers need to return to the roots of movie theater entertainment: having fun. Captain America was a FUN movie. It was entertaining.

For the average movie goer who doesn't know about Cap or his history, you'll have a pretty good time. Regardless of other reviews there is plenty of action and just enough background to get you on your way into the adventures of Steve Rogers without boring you with an overly hashed/retconned origin. It's a comic book movie, it's over the top hero fantasy with Red White and Blue patriotism. Not a bad thing.

For the people who have a some knowledge of the character and have read some of the newer comics and enjoy comic book heroes there should be enough here for you to comfortably recognize Cap and many of the supporting characters enough to give the hero a good tie in to be an Avenger next year in the Universe that has been created and provided for us by the various directors and actors who have brought it to life on the big screen.

If you are a hardcore comic book fan and the mere idea of your childhood heroes being rewritten and put on the big-screen is enough to make you flame every website and semi-positive review then please don't bother seeing the movie. You do yourself a disservice as well as to anyone else who managed to enjoy themselves for 2 hours who do not need your irate banter telling them how stupid they are and how everyone sucks.

If you are a Cap fan (like me) go into the movie knowing that this is yet another rendition out of the many we have already seen in our lives and the best one so far with the added attraction of the Avengers movie next year. I've seen Captain America wearing a motorcycle helmet in a made for TV movie that had next to nothing to do with his origin, the newer movie most others have seen with Ronnie Cox as the President, and even the old black and white serial where Captain America was a lawyer wielding a .38 revolver. Countless comic books, reboots to the series, alternate this that and the other, I'm just glad to see Captain America hit the modern movie scene with some good special effects and star power. There are also plenty of homages in the movie to the old comics if you look for them, my favorite being the most obvious of Dr. Zola's face being captured in that large round lens as a shout out to the fans of that ridiculous floating head in a hover chair.

Go into this movie looking to be entertained and have some fun. If you go into it to dissect it (even after claiming you were ""giving it a chance"") you will pretty much waste any money you ever spend watching a super hero movie, good or bad.",1319500800,9,3359,4.409677419354839
4698538,4,B005GYJPYW,"Before I saw this film in the theater this summer, I didn't consider myself to be that much of a Captain America fan. In fact, I didn't know much about Captain America at all, outside of the fact that he was in the Avengers and had a long and storied history with Tony Stark.

But then I watched this film and decided that, hey, maybe this is a character I want to know about.

If you're looking at buying/renting this movie, you probably know the basic story behind the character. But in case you don't: Steve Rogers, 90 pound weakling, wants nothing more than to fight for his country in World War II. He is rejected at every turn, before finally being selected to be injected with the experimental Super Soldier serum.

This is a very good adaptation of the origin story presented in the comics, and fits nicely into the puzzle that Marvel has been building, leading up to the Avengers. This is one of my favorite of the Marvel adaptations so far, and I can't wait to see where they take the Cap story next.",1319500800,4,1010,4.390374331550802

4698540,4,B005GYJPYW,"Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) isn't exactly cut out for the Army: he's short, scrawny, and asthmatic.  In essence, he's the exact opposite of what Uncle Sam is looking for.  Yet Steve just can't wait to get over to Germany and kick some Nazi butt.  A scientist (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci) admires Rogers's ambition, as well as his good heart, and enlists him in a special Army program, against the wishes of Colonel Phillips (a deadpan Tommy Lee Jones).  Rogers come out of the experiment stronger and smoother, and teams up with a feisty female (tough-as-hell Hayley Atwell), his best bud (super-suave Sebastian Stan), and scientist Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper doing a dead-on Robert Downey Jr.) to take on the evil Johann Schmidt (the always-sinister Hugo Weaving) and his cohort (Toby Jones.

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER has one solid thing going for it (no, not that god-awful title): its cast.  Everywhere is admirably cast, and while a few get underused (both Joneses, for example), and still others don't get much time to shine (Weaving is perfect when he's Schmidt, but as Red Skull, the special effects kind of get away from him), throughout these characters remain relatable and intriguing.  We genuinely root for Rogers, and though Captain America comes off as a bit of a d***** (rhymes with ""whoosh""), that could be intentional.  Director Joe Johnston knows what he's doing, at least: crafting a middle-of-the-road superhero flick, something meant to tide us over until THE AVENGERS gets here (the set-up for the latter is actually interesting; not believable or original, but interesting).

It seems I'm heaping a lot of criticism on the film.  Well, I am.  But note those 4 stars.  CAPTAIN AMERICA shouldn't be taken for anything more than it is.  It's not a great comic book film; merely a good one.  But hell, that's better than so many others out there.  If nothing else, it makes the 1940s look spectacular; kudos to Johnston for knowing how to make a period piece.  Watch this film if you're a fan of the comics, enjoy a good action/adventure yarn, or want to know all the pieces of the puzzle before seeing THE AVENGERS.

4698541,5,B005GYJPYW,"While Captain America (Chris Evans) and his origin have had screen time before it's no mean feat to bring off TWO origins stories in one film (a period film no less), make it a fun adventure AND set up a big screen sequel with what amounts to a satisfying ending all in a little over two hours.

Joe Johnston's experience with previous franchise films (""Jurassic Park III"") and retro superhero stories (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rocketeer-20th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B005JZBP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rocketeer: 20th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray</a>]) boded well for ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". Set during World War II (as was Cap's origin story)and featuring his greatest nemesis from the time (The Red Skull expertly played by Hugo Weaving). Of all the superhero movies this past summer only ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" delievered on all fronts. The main flaw of the movie is that the origin story as essential as it is seems to go on a bit too long but, in some respects, that also allows us to identify even more with Rogers as we share his frustration every step of the way. Unfortunately that also leaves LESS story for us to see Cap in action.

Originally presented in 3D in theaters ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" looks marvelous with a simply stunning Blu-ray transfer--colors are bold in a retro sort of way and the detail is amazing from the crisp, sharp images to the 7.1 lossless Surround mix.

Special features include a feature commentary with director Johnston surrounded by DP Shelly Johnson and Editor Jeffrey Ford. Their discussion focuses primarily on the technical aspect and while there are large sections of silence, they don't babble away like many folks do on commentary tracks.

We also get six featurettes on the creation of the film that covers everything from costuming, adapting the comic and the characters of Rogers and the Red Skull. Also included is a featurette on the transformation of Rogers from whimp to action hero. We also get an opportunity to hear from co-creator Joe Simon (who wrote ""Captain America"" while the great artist Jack Kirby did the artwork and helped plot the comic as well)on the origin of Cap. The special features are rounded off by two theatrical trailers for the film and a short ""Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To Thor's Hammer"" that follows Agent Colson as he makes his way to the site where Thor's hammer falls in the film ""Thor"".

Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to enlist in the good fight against the Nazi's during World War II but he's a 96 pound weakling; Roger is left behind while his pals including ""Bucky"" Barnes ship off to fight in Europe, he's left behind feeling like even more of a loser. Rogers can't pass the physical until Dr. Abraham Erskin (Stanley Tucci)takes an interest in Rogers and signs him up for his super solider experiment. Once injected with Erksin's powerful formula Rogers transforms into everything that Erskin could have hoped for the only problem is that Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones perfectly cast)sees Rogers as little more than a promotional tool once it becomes clear he won't get any more super soldiers and sees his best possible soldier as too big an asset to gamble on in battle. Ultimately, though, it's only Captain America as he comes to be known while out promoting war bonds that can fight the mutant result of another of Erskin's experiments the Red Skull.

Although the film focuses a bit too much on Cap before he gets out there to fight the Red Skull, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" delivers on the promise made early with Marvel films such as ""Iron Man"" and is the best of the batch after that film with a strong retro look, great action sequences and some truly stunning set pieces. The film also provides the perfect set up for next summer's action superhero epic Josh Whedon's ""The Avengers"" and we get a brief peak at that film at the conclusion of this film after the credits.

4698543,4,B005GYJPYW,"On its surface, the Captain America character is pretty ridiculous. The name alone is rife with World War II jingoism that seems out of place in today's considerably more cynical and global world.  Director Joe Johnston smartly embraced the silliness that is a superhero with a giant ""A"" on his forehead through a mix of digital wizardry, American montages, and good old fashioned Nazi-punching.

Steve Rogers (who first appears as a digitally-altered version of Chris Evans) is an asthmatic wimp with a hero's heart.  He can't fight for beans and he's been rejected from the Army four times, but that doesn't stop him.  Rogers may not be popular with the ladies but he's a moral man, a theme that will carry throughout the film. It's his bright soul that attracts former German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to Rogers for a top-secret super-soldier project.

That project, initiated by Erskine under the funding of insane Nazi Johann Schmidt (played with feral menace by Hugo Weaving), is a super-soldier serum.  It has one side-effect however - whoever is injected with the glowing blue stuff gains super strength and endurance but also reveals his true self. Schmidt's face peels off, thus his moniker The Red Skull.  Once Rogers becomes the hero he always knew he could be, Captain America: The First Avenger really gets rolling.

Until then, the scrawny, CGI-diminished form of Rogers is distracting.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but Evans just doesn't look right. Evans' booming voice betrays the deeply powerful body that it belongs to. But once Rogers is in Evan's true form, he is a wonder to behold.  The film literally hits the ground running once Rogers becomes Captain America.

Lurking around the edges of Captain America is the idea of the ubermensch or superman.  It's interesting that the film completely avoids this topic; Erskine's genetic research was a real focus for both the German and U.S. governments.  Good old Cap is the Nazi ideal realized, but the script never goes there.

The Nazi obsession with the reclamation of a Slavic identity is also missing.  In part, this was the motivation behind the Ahhenerbe quest for ancient artifacts proving German supremacy - the same quests that were made legendary in the Indiana Jones series.  There is mention of Yggdrasil, the Nordic tree of life, and the Tesseract, which fortunately is never actually named in the film. This cube, a boundless source of energy, funds all sorts of Schmidt's projects and it's not long before he turns against his Nazi overseers to launch his own splinter organization, HYDRA.

Captain America is basically a guy juiced up on super steroids that runs around with a bull's-eye shield, and the film cleverly capitalizes on the larger-than-life comic book without disrespecting the pulp feel of an ugly war.  Rogers transforms from super-soldier to poster boy for America, and his ridiculous outfit comes complete with dancing girls.  This plays well in the States until Rogers is sent to the front lines to cheer up the troops, where he's jeered as a ""chorus girl.""

The film never lets us forget this: superheroes are ridiculous enough in civilian life, but in war they're a dangerous liability.  Rogers has to prove himself every day to crusty Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, with some of the funniest lines in the film) and the beautiful-but-tough British Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter).  Atwell's burgeoning romance with Evans centers the film; they're less star-crossed lovers than two kids just trying to go out on a first date in a war-torn world.

Captain America, being a war film, has heaping measures of American optimism and personal loss.  The optimism is embodied by the Howard Hughes-like Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing Tony Stark's father), who is the host of the World's Fair and inventor of Rogers' outfit.  When Rogers' best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is captured by HYDRA, it's propels Captain America to risk everything to rescue him. During that rescue mission Rogers gets a glimpse of a map with the locations of HYDRA's bases, leading to the final conflict as Captain America and his soldier buddies take down the wicked organization, one technologically-advanced Nazi at a time.

It's hard not to love Captain America.  Ever respectful of its roots, it harks back to a time when America believed in the promise that anyone could be a hero at a time when the world desperately needed heroes.  Although it glosses over some rough edges, this is a film made by someone who clearly loved war films.  You can see the fingerprints of its pulp ancestors on everything from the lensing to the musical score to the brilliantly executed credits.  Captain America may be something of an anachronism in today's world, but this film does his reputation justice as a war hero.",1319500800,3,4837,4.987546699875467
4698544,5,B005GYJPYW,"I thought this film was a fine outing by Marvel. Fans of the hero will feel happy to know that Marvel got his origin just right. Chris Evans is fantastic as the earnest, honest Steve Rogers. I felt that the villain in the film could have evinced more menace, but one cannot have everything. The tech in the film (shield, ships, etc) reflects some top-notch effects work.

As an aside, please disregard any reviews of this film that address whether or not the film has any nudity, or ""language"" that could be ""harmful"" to children. These concerns are irrelevant, and reflect backwards thinking. People need to STOP worrying about children accidentally seeing breasts or hearing an ""f-bomb"".

I always liked him as an actor but he really outdid himself in this one to create one of the most likable superheroes ever.

Joe Johnston more than made up for his last movie the Wolfman with his directing in this.

His best film since the Rocketeer.

I also have to say that Hayley Atwell is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen in a movie.  She is amazing.

Thor and Green Lantern were good, but Captain America was much better in my opinion. Although the twist at the end with him being in modern day America is sure to make me enjoy the next film that much more. The movie is about a young soldier named Steve Rogers who volunteers to undergo a series of experiments for the US army Super Soldier program. After transforming him into a Super Soldier the rest is history and Captain America becomes the First Avenger,

The digital copy is presented with an English Audio track. I have to thank Paramount for not screwing over the fans and giving us a real Digital Copy thats compatible with iTunes and works on iPhones and iPads. Warner Brothers Green Lantern digital copy was a joke and did not allow a iTunes download only a streaming gimmick through flixster known as the ultraviolet digital copy. The video and sound are top notch and although the film was not filmed in 3D it still looks decent in 3D, but I prefer the 2D version as to me it just looks better.

They not only got it right, and cast the perfect guy to do it, they made a film that feels so fresh, simply by getting away from the tiresome darkness and the shaky-cam violence that is in every film.

The acting wasn't really a problem for me. However, I was expecting the action to be the best part of the movie, but what I got was a collection of 60 second action snap shots (the focus of which should have been the majority of the movie). Lastly, the Nazi character (the bad guy) is just way too over-the-top to watch. I found his character extremely annoying. I guess I was hoping for Iron Man (the first not the second) but instead I just got a really slow, bad Hollywood movie.",1319414400,8,659,4.196850393700787

After tiny Steve Rogers is once again denied entrance to the US Army he is followed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. When told about an option to join he jumps on it. After a series of tests he is given an experimental procedure to make him s ""super-soldier"". He comes out bigger, stronger and faster. He becomes Captain America. This movie is another victim of hype. This is a very good movie, but it's not the ""best superhero"" movie ever. I do think that the releasing has a lot to do with that. In my opinion the best superhero movie of the year was ""X-Men : First Class"", and if this came out first I may have liked this more. The one thing I really liked about this movie is that it was more like ""X-Men"" then ""Green Lantern"" in the fact that it was more about the story then effects. That did help the movie, as well as the casting. Overall, this is a good movie but with the hype, as well as the other comic book movies released lately, I was expecting more. I give it a B.

*Also try - Iron Man & X-Men : First Class",1319328000,2,1159,4.105726872246696
4698552,5,B005GYJPYW,"This is one great movie! I saw this one in the movie theater 3 times over the summer, and loved it every time. Chris Evans does not disappoint - a regular guy who is also fearless and ready to stand up for what's right. A little over the top, which is to be expected considering this movie is based on a series of comic books by Joe Simon, and were set in the 1940's, but the movie overall is very entertaining and great for a whole family!",1319241600,,440,4.068965517241379
4698553,4,B005GYJPYW,"After seeing Iron Man one and two, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and now Captain America, it seems pretty clear that Marvel knows what it's doing when it comes to making its comics into movies. So far, none of Marvel's cinematic offerings have flopped commercially or critically, and Captain America is just another notch on its belt.  My basic view of the movie is that it fits into the overall tone and style of Marvel's previous movies, it has an excellent cast, its story and script are quite good, and it made me even more excited to see next summer's unprecedented movie project The Avengers.

Chris Evans is great as Captain America.  If anyone has any qualms about him because of his involvement in the mediocre Fantastic Four movies, then they will be put swiftly to rest within the first twenty minutes of Captain America. There is nothing about his portrayal of Captain America that made me once think of Johnny Storm (Human Torch). Nor, happily, did it put me in mind of his hilarious turn as an Evil Ex in the epic and underrated Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World.

Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is predictably awesome, and the rest of the cast does a great job as well.

One interesting aspect of the movie is that the character Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) has a prominent role in the movie.  So in  The Avengers movie there will already be an interesting dynamic between Captain America and Iron Man, since they will have both known Tony's father in a different capacity.  Also, if you've already seen Thor (And why wouldn't you have?) then you will recognize  that the mysterious relic of power in Captain America is shown in an ""Easter Egg"" scene after the final credits in Thor.

As some have noted, there is a marked similarity between the whimsical and classic adventure tone of Captain America and that of the Indiana Jones series, although Captain America is far more in keeping with the vintage Indiana Jones spirit than the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This is what the fourth Indiana Jones movie should have been like-- well, sort of.

In any case, anyone that has enjoys Marvel's offerings so far is sure to enjoy Captain America.  Let's hope they can pull off their major movie gamble next summer so they can continue putting out excellent action movies without delay.",1319155200,2,2304,4.7182044887780545
4698554,4,B005GYJPYW,"Some of the special effects in this movie are incredible, some of the best I have ever seen. I was just stunned how good they were.

The actual filming is brilliant.

The story itself is sometimes a bit weak, still it is from comics so you cannot expect too much there. Whatever short coming in the story was more than made up by some good acting. I thought that everyone played very well.

Most entertaining, I would recommend it.",1319068800,3,431,4.430379746835443
4698555,5,B005GYJPYW,"Okay,so i read some reviews,and now I've gotta say something (again).First,someone who claimed to be a fan and comic-book reader made a remark about fitting Cap's transition from WW2
to the modern age as being accomplished by the film writers. Actually that story goes all the way back to Cap's resurrection by Marvel Comics for""The Avengers""comic back in the sixties.
In the story Cap is discovered by the already-formed Avengers in ""suspended animation"" (one of the favorites of writers back then of dealing with long gaps of time in a character's career),at the North Pole.
this is just another example for Marvel's genius at remaining faithful to a character,while retaining,and even improving upon the storyline to fit in today's cinematic world. It was great to discover that
Captain America can still make my heart pound while clobbering the Nazis, or anyone else who thinks they can ""Tread On"" the good ol' USA!In closing I would like to mention how GREAT it was to
see the ""Howling Commandos"" (Nick Fury's original platoon during WW2,which developed over the Marvel years into his promotion to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.), in action during the film. And one last tidbit of nostalgia-I remember being about 12 or 13,and coming across a Marvel re-print of  Captain America's original story,first printed ca. 1941, and even the MACHINERY in the movie looks like the lab & electronic equipment drawn in the original comic!
  So-KUDOES & LAUREL wreaths for Marvel,Captain America, and the coming of the Avengers! Personally,I can't wait.",1318982400,2,1539,5.148
4698556,3,B005GYJPYW,"Well, here we go again with another comic book character being made into a high budget feature film.  I suspect they will continue to get made until we stop going to see them.  The Marvel cast of superheroes eventually becomes a gang called The Avengers.  This film is about a 1945 young man who wants to get into the fight against Hitler and the Nazis.  Because he is small and frail, he is always rejected by the Army.  He is being observed however, by members of a small group of scientific government types as a subject for an experiment to make a super soldier.  He is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and becomes The Chosen One (he he).

The experiment works but soon after, everything is destroyed by a Nazi infiltrator.  We get a high dose of wizardry in terms of exotic weapons, especially from an ultra Nazi called Red Skull.  Yep, he has one too.  I really liked that.  Assuming you can get past the re-creation of WW II, ""CA"" has much to offer.  First, the retro look of the film is a welcome departure from the more futuristic style of most films of this ilk.  Like the ""X-Men"" prequel of a few months ago, the acting is very good.  Chris Evans in particular is well suited to this role.  He gives Rogers/Capt. America a nice guy/Superman image, complete with a sense of humor.  Does this film rank as one of the best of the genre?  Well, not quite.  It's better than the ""Greens"" but not as good as ""Thor"" or the aforementioned ""X-Men"".

1-2-12: Blu ray update - The DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is excellent with window rattling explosions but also subtle enough to show off the score from Alan Silvestri.  This 2-D version is also visually excellent.  The package comes with numerous featurettes, commentary tracks, deleted scenes and 5 trailers.",1318896000,2,1758,4.552715654952077
4698557,3,B005GYJPYW,"So in short the movie was OKAY. It had plenty of good characters involved and the story told was decent. However the movie lacked a lot of action to really show what Captain America could do. Not to mention the way the movie was presented was an extremely bad idea. It was rushed and a lot of the movie is summary scenes (one scene flashing over multiple instances with music attempting to tell a story in 1.5 seconds so we can rush to the end). Captain America needed more time to develope and better action scenes to show off his abilities. I walked away thinking, ""What is Captain America going to do in the Avengers? Hand out towels and water for the real superheroes?"". The movie was entertaining, but lacked the enjoyment and fun that other superhero flicks have captured.",1318896000,11,778,4.564285714285714
4698558,4,B005GYJPYW,"Marvel movies rarely get better than Captain America: The First Avenger.  The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.  All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is a supremely enjoyable and just plain awesome superhero film that is more than worth your time and attention, and it does a fantastic job at making us all forget about that early 90s schlock-fest with the rubber-earred suit.",1318723200,2,1330,4.972972972972973

Somehow the Red Skull has gotten a hold of the Cosmic Cube, but with no idea what to do with it, and Cap has even less idea what's going on.  It's like a condensed version of what the movie should have been, but with just a beginning, and an end.

4698566,1,B005GYJPYW,"Well I saw this movie, for one reason.  I am a fan of Captain America. But what a disgrace to the generation that fought and won World War Two. For one, the US ARMY was Segregated in World War Two. There were secret units,ranger, called them commando units if you like,raider units, special operations units in the war like today, but they all were staffed by white soldiers.  Black soldiers unfortunatly were placed in segregated units, mainly in Quartemaster, Transport, and Adminstrative units.  But there were two Division of All Black soldiers that fought in Italy.  They performed well, but were ill served by there white officers. Other units were Artillery, and Armor units that fought above and beyond the call of duty.  It was a big mistake for the army to segregate soldiers, after all we all bleed red.
  But Hollywood always misrepresents the facts.  This trends need to stop, because it is like re-writing history that most Americans do not know.

Sure they're different characters, with different ways they are created, born or transformed, but for godsakes, I can only count 2 that stepped away from the formulaic same old same old screenplay: Dark Knight & X:Men First Class.

CAPTAIN AMERICA is an interesting film, don't get me wrong, and I'm almost certainly gonna buy the BLu-ray when it's available, but it has pretty much the exact same storyline as Spiderman 1-3, Iron Man 1-2, Batman Begins, Green Lantern etc. etc. etc. Superhero starts out a normal guy, becomes a superhero, learns he has skills, practices his skills, bad guy threatens to destroy the world and Superhero fights bad guy.

I know. I know. That's comics. Like I said, maybe it's the oversaturation of these movies on the cinemaplexes. You may ask, what do you want? Well, I want the unpredictablility of DARK KNIGHT. I want the emotions of X:Men First Class. I want to feel my guy tensed up in knots like it did when Sebastian Shaw comes to convince the mutant students to join him, or when the Joker put the two people Batman cared about in different warehouses and you actually... wait for it... wait for it... FELT SOMETHING.

I wanted to feel something. I wanted to feel some emotions, rather than just saying, that was cool looking. CAPTAIN AMERICA is cool looking, and for what it is, it's a good movie.

1) DO humanize your hero but not by creating disgusting habits in him (Iron Man) - rather by presenting him as the personified goodness all humans possess but infrequently act on. DON'T turn him into a total pathetic wuss and moronic jerk at the beginning only to turn the improbable light switch for him to become the hero he's supposed to be.
2) DO showcase the central character in ALL his comic book glory and yes, a little patriotic flag waving doesn't hurt. Um, he is suppeosed to be an AMERICAN hero after all not just a ""citizen of the world."" DON'T be ashamed of the golden legacy that turned an imagined character into an enduring icon of American culture. (Superman Returns and Smallville - I'm thinking of you.)
3) DO stick to ONE story thread and carry it to completion. DON'T try to ""add depth and diversity"" by intoducing a bunch of superfluous characters that only serve to create a mess (Green Lantern, G.I. Joe and again, Smallville).
4) DO give the superhero a supervillain worthy of him. DON'T save the good stuff for a planned sequel because if your original movie sucks, the sequel becomes very unlikely (Superman Returns - Spacey's version of Lex Luthor was laughable and not in a good way. The first Hulk - his own father???)
5) DO bring out the trumpets and flurries for a memorable theme song. DON'T rely on cheesy heavy metal ""music"" (Matrix movies).
6) DO allow the superhero to fall long and hard for the ONE true love of his life and vice versa. DON'T create insanely obnoxious girly pointless melodrama (Spider-Man, Superman Returns and Smallville). On similar note, DO present the hero's LOVE and soulmate in all her stellar glory as his one and only equal - SHOW it, DON'T just say it.
7) DO frame the hero in stunning action sequences in all his head to toe uniformed glory (Tom Welling, PLEASE take note). DON'T pick an actor to play said hero if he's going to refuse to wear the suit by trying to hide behind a lame ass excuse such as ""it's more interesting to show what happend in the character's life before he became the hero we know him to be."" DON'T, DO NOT disrespect your audience by presuming to tell us what to think. If you're going to film the Statue of Liberty, doesn't it make sense that the audience expects to actually SEE the Statue of Liberty and not a blurry CGI version of it or just a close up of the head?

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is quite simply, THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. Chris Evans and Haley Atwell are bona fide stars. Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and really, ALL the supporting characters have earned my respect. The writers and director Joe Johnston have created a masterpiece.

4698581,4,B005GYJPYW,"I'm a big time comic book fan, so I knew I was going to see this in theaters ever since it was announced. However, I was never a big Captain America fan; he just never appealed to me in the way that other iconic superheroes like Spider-Man and Superman did, which was largely due to never feeling the character's personality was as clearly defined as it should be for such a premiere superhero, even after reading most of Ed Brubaker's run on the title, which is considered one of the most definitive runs on Captain America.

What sold me on the experience and made me excited about seeing this movie was that moment in the third trailer when a grenade is tossed amongst Steve Rogers (Captain America) and the rest of the super soldier candidates and everyone else runs away from the threat while Steve's instinct is to protect others from it. This was the moment when I said, ""Oh, wow, they nailed it."" It will also undoubtedly go down as one of my favorite all time superhero movie moments.

Chris Evans did an excellent job carrying the essence of that scene with him throughout the entire film, which makes Steve come off as genuine in a role that could have easily oozed corniness. I had faith in Evans ever since I saw his portrayal of a no-nonsense astronaut in Sunshine, and I'm glad to say he's silenced any critics who thought he couldn't dial back the wisecracking that he's known for and given Cap a different feel than Human Torch, having played both superheroes.

You can say the same for the performances of the film's other stars like Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, and Hugo Weaving. There were a lot of moments and lines that this movie could have fumbled based on their concept, but the actors and creative team clearly bought into the idea of Steve wanting to serve and fight simply because it was the right thing to do.

There are really only a couple of negatives with the film, the first being I thought Cap's fighting scenes could have been polished up a bit more and the second being I wanted a little more screen time for Red Skull.

All things considered, I'd definitely say the thing that makes this the best Marvel Studios production since Iron Man is the heart, and I mean this in multiple respects. Too often a studio will churn out a big budget film like this and concentrate more on effects and merchandising than story and character development. After being disappointed by the lack of heart in DC's summer offering of Green Lantern, I'm hoping other superhero films and blockbusters in general will try to have as much substance to go along with the flash as Captain America.",1314921600,4,2626,4.590618336886994

2011 has been a stellar year for Marvel Comics and their movie division. This year saw the release of three feature films featuring iconic, flagship characters from their vast library of superheroes. Both Thor and X-Men First Class were excellent films. There were high hopes for Captain America: The First Avenger. This is one of Marvel's oldest, most respected titles. Unfortunately, the movie fell short and left me with a sense of disappointment.

I just found it very difficult to get into the movie at all. A lot of that falls on the director, Joe Johnston. I felt as though he just did not create a captivating enough world to keep viewers engaged in this movie. Unfortunately, his recent history as a director has not been so great and this movie continued that trend.

A lot of the blame can be placed squarely on the cast of this movie. Let's start at the top. Chris Evans was completely the wrong choice to play Captain America, Steve Rogers. He said in interviews he was very hesitant to take the role and that came full bore in this movie. His acting was just bad. He was unconvincing and it really felt like he was phoning it in the whole movie. This movie also had Tommie Lee Jones playing a colonel. Did Tommie need a paycheck that bad to do this movie? Even he could have done better. The lead actress in the film was Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. She was decent enough in this, but there was just no chemistry between her and Chris Evans. Although this has been a common problem for marvel as the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman in Thor was also sub-par. But I will not trash the entire cast. I did like Dominic Cooper's performance as Howard Stark. I really felt he belonged in this movie and didn't feel like I was watching Cooper play Stark. I felt like I was watching Howard Stark.

I am going to mention Hugo Weaving separately. While I thought his portrayal of Red Skull was fine, I mention him here to talk about the costuming. The costuming was just not that great. The Red Skull makeup really reminded me of The Mask. Yeah, remember that movie starring Jim Carrey. Great makeup for the early ninities, not so good for 2011. Another problem I had was Captain America's suit. I really thought it looked like a paintball outfit. Although, that would have been a hilarious way to settle the war, it just felt out of place.

All in all, this movie had potential. A few minor tweaks and at least one recasting would have made this movie a lot better. It is watchable. I'm going to give this movie a 5/10. I'll probably re-watch it with the other Marvel films in preparation for The Avengers and ensuing movie marathons once Avengers is on Blu-Ray.",1314835200,19,2698,4.54320987654321
4698584,2,B005GYJPYW,I didn't really care for any of the action scenes or the characters. I'm also usually fond of Shelley Johnson's cinematography but this film is butt-ugly.,1314403200,4,154,4.961538461538462
4698585,4,B005GYJPYW,"I've never been this excited for superhero a movie. Everything appealed to me, the WWII setting, the cast, the difference from usual Marvel movies, and the fact that it was the last movie leading up to the Avengers. And I wasn't the only one, a lot of hype surrounded Captain America: The First Avenger. But does it live up to all this anticipation? My answer: pretty much, yeah.

Let me begin by saying that Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers, the skinny, patriotic weakling turned superheroic icon. This is a character who wants to be selfless and brave, to lay down his life for his country, but his physical limitations just won't let him.

The rest of the cast is spot on. Stanley Tucci is Dr. Erskine, who chooses Steve to become the first of a new breed of super soldier that will give the Allies an advantage in the war, especially against the Nazi division called HYDRA. He ends up serving as a mentor to Steve, and is also quite funny. Tommy Lee Jones is great as Colonel Phillips, proving a lot of dry wit. Haley Atwell is Agent Peggy Carter, and sometimes characters like her frustrate me, as if they're only there to make a feministic statement. Fortunately that is completely averted, and while the Carter/Rogers romance is nothing to write home about, Atwell and Evans handle the characters well and they get many fun scenes. Dominic Cooper is Howard Stark, and his swaggering performance just screams ""Iron Man's dad!""

I kept expecting Hugo Weaving's Johann Shmidt (otherwise called the Red Skull), the head of HYRDA, to erupt into campiness and explode at Toby Jone's Arnim Zola. After all, Dr. Zola isn't exactly comfortable with Shmidt breaking away from Hitler and having HYRDA go rogue, and he's had some failures too. But instead, they both have very interesting interaction and the characters are well played.

There's something to be said about The First Avenger's wartime atmosphere. You get the distinct feeling that you're in the proto-Marvel universe. This is what started it all, Cap is chronologically Marvel's first hero. And not just any hero, but a symbol, an icon, not a mystery man. Kids in the Marvel world grow up reading about a very real super soldier who saved the world.

The action is great and you can see everything that's going on (unlike a certain other superhero movie about a certain Norse god...). And don't worry, all the cool shield throws and Cap stuff you would expect are present.

Okay, so what I do I not like? Well, for one, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best friend, Buck Barnes, gets really shortchanged and I think they should've done more with him.

But other than that, I think there's one central problem that leads to a lot of other problems. And here it is: By film's end, I still felt like Steve Rogers was still that Brooklyn kid who just became a hero. I don't think this is Evans' fault at all. First, the pacing gets messed up. Everything is fine until, right after Steve goes on his very first adventure as Captain America, the movie jumps into a montage. Suddenly Cap is leading the Howling Commandos and destroying HYDRA war factories. I wanted to see more of his training, more of the camaraderie of him and the Commandos. As if that weren't enough, we don't really know how the heroes are taking down these factories, we just see them fighting. That way, HYDRA is very unthreatening, and I never believed for a second that they could take over the world. You could say that Cap's WWII career doesn't feel storied enough. I would have liked multiple clashes with the Red Skull, (and that way there would have been way more Hugo Weaving). He should not have been a looming big bad, but a true, diabolical nemesis.

Finally I must talk of Cap's finest hour. Ya know, he gets frozen. It's done alright, but it's also in the shadow of what the TV series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes has done. In EMH, Bucky and Cap have prevented the Red Skull from using the power of the other Realms and winning war. The Skull is going to get away in a rocket, so Cap tells Bucky to stay behind and resolves to defeat the Skull once and for all. The rocket takes off, with Cap climbing the outside ladder, only for him to find that Bucky has followed him. Then Red Skull ejects using his 'jet seat', safely getting away and revealing that the rocket is going to explode. Bucky can't jump off because his foot is snagged on a broken part of the ladder, but when Cap attempts to save him, Bucky just kicks him off to save HIM. Cap falls into the water, about to be frozen for the next seventy years, while Bucky dies in the explosion. In The First Avenger, Cap is alone, and it's less...dramatic. Still, it's good, and I won't spoil what the last thing he says is.

I have some frustrations, but I still think that Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. It's got it all; the tone, the themes, the characters, the acting, the action. Next to the first Iron-Man, this is arguably the Marvel cinematic universe's best movie so far.

4698586,5,B005GYJPYW,"This is the best movie I've seen this year and, for me, that is big. I've watched The Rise of The Planet of The Apes and the new X-Men movie, but I really liked Captain America. It has a lot of positive messages and different scenes and action parts that keep you interested. It isn't the same old thing.

Although, I wish Captain America would have said, ""I love you,"" to his girlfriend, when talking on the phone. It seemed like they were getting to that point but he never confessed it. I think that would have been a heartwarming moment.

Other than that..... the movie was great! It's a family friendly video and you don't have to worry about your kids hearing or seeing anything bad. I can't recall any curse words and there were no inappropriate scenes or jokes. The women in the film were also well dressed and I didn't see any women dressing provocatively.

4698587,4,B005GYJPYW,"When i first heard that they were making a captain america movie, I was both excited and worried. Marvel had already let me down with my favorite hero, wolverine, that I was nervous that they would destroy my second favorite. But as more screens and trailers began to arrive, I was excited that Steve Rogers would be given the movie treatment that his character deserves. I can say that overall this was a great superhero movie that captured the greatness that Captain America represents. I'd give this movie a 4.5/5 if I could. I had to go to the low-end on Amazon with a 4/5 because to me the movies biggest weakness is the incredibly under-developed red skull who is a much more terrifying and complex villian than the movie could produce. I do give Hugo weaving credit for what he was able to do with the character though.

4698589,4,B005GYJPYW,"I rarely watch movies in theaters anymore, because I just don't enjoy most of the ones coming out nowadays.  Still, I heard from a reliable source that this movie was good, so I checked it out.  I figured it might tingle my Catholic sense the way Spider-man 2 did, or it might not, the way Iron Man did.  Still, I knew there was a chance that it might really be good.  I love the true-blue hero types like Captain America, and I love the older comic books on which this kind of adventure is based, so I checked it out.

First, let me start off by saying that the movie gets a lot right.  A period piece set in the times of the 1940s near the end of the second world war, a wimpy little guy called Steve Rodgers wants to be a soldier more than anything, but no matter what he tries, he just can't seem to pass the army's tough recruitment guidelines.  Enter a military scientist; originally from germany, who promises to give him a chance to be in the army, by means of an experimental formula, which amplifies all the natural powers of his body to the absolute peak of human potential and, perhaps, beyond.  Rodgers undergoes the procedure and becomes Captain America; fighting in the war to protect his friend Bucky, and the other brave soldiers on the front lines.  Much action and adventure ensue.  This ultimately leads him into conflict with the Red Skull; a supervillain in charge of Hydra; a nazi splinter-group that uses advanced technology derived from a strange, recently-discovered power source.

The list of differences between this movie and the comics it was based on would go on for days, and don't really matter anyway.  In the comics, Bucky wore a costume too, but his role was otherwise the same, and frankly, I agree with this change.  Bucky didn't undergo the procedure, so it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for him to be CA's sidekick in a movie like this one.

The content of this movie pleased me greatly in some ways.  There was relatively little cursing, the violence and death didn't get gorey (though in a story about war, there will never be a lack of death,) and the closest thing to sexual content was a woman yanking CA's necktie and kissing him.  The action is a little goofy at times, and overall, is has about the same vibe as a cartoon with more military types in it, which will appeal to some, and not to others.  I know some who were hoping this would be a legitimate war movie, but I don't see how it could have been.

The dialogue is rather standard fare, and the characters aren't terribly deep.  There's not much soul-searching, and the villain is rather two-dimensional.  In short, it wasn't Spider-man 2.  That said, I loved it, because this kind of storytelling really was popular a couple generations ago, when characters didn't have to be deep or excessively-complicated to be interesting.  Archetypes are strong and rarely deviated from in this movie, and I consider that a good thing, since when you get down to it, that's really what Captain America is about.  He's an archetype for the virtuous soldier.  Seeing him in that light, a whole slew of other things about the movie become clear.

On one level, the main character demonstrates tremendous courage, strength of will, dedication, humility and care for his fellow man, yet he knows what kinds of tough choices have to be made in a time of war.  He's moral to a tremendous degree, which is enough by itself to impress me, but the film has other things hidden in it as well.

In one scene, the doctor explains his reasons for choosing Rodgers as his subject; because he believed that strong men become used to their strength, and always want more, but weak men know the value of strength, and how to be good and true.  I don't care whether this was intended or not; this line sets up the rest of the movie as an allegory for Heaven; where only the most virtuous, couragious, humble people will go to be glorified, and receive new bodies, which can be used to help others.  That put a smile on my face when I thought of it in that light.

Still, the movie isn't without its downsides.  The hydra group takes center stage as the villains very early on, and seems to be just about the only group of nazis that cap fights.  Maybe I misread that, but I felt like this was an attempt to sort of pidgeonhole our hero into his own little world, so he doesn't bother the rest of the war going on.  I would have preferred to see real nazis with real villain motivations, or even a thorough characterization of Hitler, but that might have been too much to ask for, considering the direction that modern world events are taking.

There's one thing I'm sure of; this is a good movie, because it's a movie about good people doing good things.  It's no masterpiece, doesn't go too far into its characters, and the war action is, I feel, disrupted a bit by the odd technology being thrown around, but it's still a good film, and that's so uncommon nowadays, that I don't feel it would be right of me to give it less than four stars in any category.  It may not be very thought-provoking, but it's got its soul in the right place, and I couldn't be happier about it.",1313798400,16,5163,4.478632478632479

4698592,4,B005GYJPYW,"This is the best comic book movie to be released this summer. That is what it is, a comic book movie. It does not surpass that level but nobody ever said it had to. While not a Spider-man 2 or Dark Knight it fits in well as a first entry in an inevitable series. Perhaps not the fun, turn the formula on its head, film that Iron Man was, it is still an excellent comic book film that manages to have developed characters and a story actually propelled by plot rather than CG sequences (I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and 3). Still, even with all its positive attributes the film might've been largely a one time viewing for me, that is, if it hadn't been for Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter.

My personal, and largest, issue with comic book movies has been their seeming inability to cast memorable and talented women in the leading lady spot. While the leading lady role has frequently been nothing more than a damsel in distress (other than perhaps in team up movies such as X-men), something unfortunately true even of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight films, here we find that is not the case. Peggy Carter is a female character who stands out amongst the many comic book movie female characters. She is strong willed, independent, can handle herself, never asks for help, doesn't take any crap and does it all in a period where women were undeniably treated as less than men. She does all these things yet she can still walk into a bar in the middle of the film wearing a red dress that leaves everyone at a loss for words.

Even better than Peggy Carter's character, and the reason I named the actress rather than the character in my review title, was the casting of Hayley Atwell in the role. The character could have become something much different without a capable actress to play the balance of tough yet feminine. Worse it could have been filled by some less capable big name actress for box office draw. For years in comic book movies I have either dreaded or at best barely stomached the casting of female leading roles.

Kirsten Dunst had her moments in the Spidey films but then would come the time when she had to be kidnapped and scream and holler for help, she also always needed a man in her life, if not Peter then another stand in to take his place. Batman Begins casting of Katie Holmes always seemed strange to me, why in a film full of lower status but credible actors would Nolan cast a more household name with much less credibility? Whatever the reason, she played the part but it is not the role anyone remembers from that film. The same goes for the sequel, in which I had high hopes Maggie Gyllenhaal would make welcome changes to the previously pitchy character, unfortunately I dare say that Rachel Dawes only became more helpless and became the one negative to be found in The Dark Knight.

More recently I was disappointed to find Gwenyth and Natalie both playing supposed strong women but one (Pepper Potts) who is subordinate to a man who treats her badly and still needs to be saved in the end and the other (Jane Foster) fairly shallow and school girlish overall.

While Jane only likes Thor at first because of his muscles, Peggy meets Steve Rogers/The Cap when he is a ninety pound weakling. We see her first tinge of interest in him when he is still this small, all based on his philosophies on fighting and dating. It is this established connection before he becomes a perfect male specimen that cements the story and keeps us truly engaged. Peggy and Steve truly bring out the best in eachother and actually share a common bond of struggling to break free from their respective stereotypes that allows the audience to believe in their relationship, one that is actually formed out of friendship first. The film is great and a wonderful starting point for a series, the ending is unique if only a plot device required for the Avengers tie in and I truly can't wait to see where they take Captain America in his sequel. He has by the end of the film, especially thanks to Peggy Carter, become quite a different hero with quite a different chip on his shoulders than any we have yet to see.

So I have wondered why comic book movies don't cast relatively unknown actresses to play these parts and allow them to really create a character. Finally Captain America has done just that with the lovely Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and I hope we see much more of it in future comic book films. The saddest part of Captain America and perhaps the thing that compells me to want to see it again Repeated times is that based on the ending it is very unlikely we will see the fantastic Peggy Carter/Hayley Atwell in all her glory in any of the sequels. They have some big shoes to fill when they inevitably try to create a Sharon Carter character, let's hope they take cues from however it was that they came to choose Hayley.",1313280000,6,4852,4.501702610669693

This is one of the more successful Marvel Comics adaptations to date.  Director Joe Johnson does a great job of creating period atmosphere and a grand war-time adventure.  Evans projects the ideal blend of sincerity and naivety both as Rogers and Cap.  I'm glad they resisted the temptation to turn him into a smart-@$$.  Some exceptional CGI is used to shrink him down to an emaciated youth for the origin story; it's absolutely seamless and perhaps the most successfully subtle use of computer graphics since Gollum in Lord of the Rings.

Then, it takes place during WWII, the last war that Americans generally supported. It becomes clear early on that the war isn't against Germans as Germans, but against a specific group out for world domination - something that appeals to today's more carefully targeted kind of enmity. From there, it moves forward in an utterly earnest way, as if no one had ever heard of irony.

4698597,5,B005GYJPYW,"2011's ""Captain America: First Avenger"" does a nice job stitching together a superhero's World War Two origins with his future as a member of the present day Avengers, wrapped around a good period action movie with a great villain and some neat special effects.

In 1942 Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (an earnest Chris Evans) is a under-sized but spunky straight-arrow kid who can't get into the military. A quirky scientist named Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and gets him into a secret super-soldier experiment run by the gruff Colonel Philips (Tommy Lee Jones) and his lovely English spy assistant Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). The experiment succeeds beyond expectations, turning Rogers into an incredibly strong, fit, and hyper-agile human being. When a Nazi assassin kills Erskine, Rogers discovers what the audience already knows, that the Nazis have their own superhuman, the ruthless Red Skull (Hugo Weaving in snarling full Germanic mode) who has evil designs rivaling those of his boss, Adolf Hitler.

Rogers is diverted to a war bonds drive as the costumed Captain America, but when he learns from Carter and Philips that his best buddy from Brooklyn is missing in action, Rogers gets into the war in a big way. A series of action sequences set up a big finale against the Red Skull, with a bittersweet ending. Fans are urged to hang through the credits for a nice teaser to the 2012 ""Avengers"" movie.

With the exception of two brief scenes set in the future, ""Captain America"" manages a nice retro feel without drowning in nostalgia; even the high tech stuff looks period appropriate. A brief romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter is handled with commendable and touching restraint. A cameo by Samuel L. Jackson nicely frames the ending. ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is highly recommended to fans of the current series of Marvel Comic superhero movies.",1312502400,,1882,5.064516129032258
4698598,4,B005GYJPYW,"Ok, we all know that super hero movies are going to be ""popcorn"" movies, i.e. movies that are trying to put as much action, noise, explosions, maybe a few girls running around, etc into two hours.  These days (yeah, I'm showing my age) I believe that the movies studios are addicted to CGI and special effects, they just don't know when to stop, and just because you can do ANYTHING you want in a movie today, most definitely dosen't mean you should do it. (see Spielberg films, Transformers, et al).  SO, Captain America, in my humble opinion, does show some restraint on the ""popcorn"" front.  Is it a popcorn movie?  yes it is.  But it sure helps having one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, The Red Skull, superbly played by Hugo.

4698600,4,B005GYJPYW,"It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/October-Sky/dp/B0006FYOTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">October Sky</a>) and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B00005JPH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>) appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers storylines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>&nbsp;and the 1977 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman/dp/B000K4X5XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman</a>.

The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as migr military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy ""Bucky"" Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves ""Bucky"" but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.

While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/""The Human Torch"" in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B00005JNTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>&nbsp;movies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infamous/dp/B000M341SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infamous</a>) as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore. No matter since the whole venture has obviously been designed as a springboard for 2012's ""Avengers"" sequel.",1312156800,,4297,6.550087873462214
4698601,5,B005GYJPYW,"Well, the summer will soon be nearing its end, although the temperatures outside don't seem to agree. With the changing of the seasons also comes the inevitable conclusion to the summer of superheroes (that's what I dubbed it a few weeks back). And now, with the release of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" this year's heroic reign over the box office for beloved comic book icons will soon be coming to a close.

""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a young man who wanted nothing more than to fight alongside the brave soldiers in World War II against the Nazi onslaught. After being rejected repeatedly due to his frail physique, Steve volunteered for an experimental treatment that would transform him into a living, breathing super-soldier. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientist named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is attempting to harness power beyond anything this world has ever seen, and Captain America may be the only one strong enough to stop him.

After so many entertaining entries this summer ranging from Marvel's ""Thor"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" to DC Comics' ""Green Lantern"", did the heroic summer end with a triumphant victory or a disappointing defeat?

The answer, as evidenced by the movie's opening weekend box office victory over ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"", combined with mostly positive reactions from critics, is that the summer of heroes definitely ends on a high note. And I for one wouldn't have expected anything less from the star-spangled avenger.

Taking heavy cues from classic Hollywood escapism, the likes of which haven't been seen in quite some time, the film embraces its more traditional atmosphere without being heavy-handed or cheesy in the process. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"") this film easily feels right at home in the ever-expanding pantheon of Marvel's self-produced comic book movies, but with some noticeable differences in storytelling.

One of the big differences you'll notice, aside from the aforementioned atmosphere, between this movie and the ones Marvel Studios has released prior (including this summer's ""Thor""), is that the story is much more serious-minded than the others. The majority of the previous films tied into this universe featured serious dramatic story arcs, but always with heavy doses of humor laced throughout to keep things sort of light-hearted.

That type of approach worked fine for those characters, and in the case of Thor it probably made his transition from comic book page to big screen that much easier to believe. However, for Captain America, a story filled with jokes, one-liners and sarcasm, even if they feel appropriate to the story, would have been completely wrong for the ever-stoic soldier and future leader of the Avengers.

Thankfully, the writers paid attention to this (most likely with some heavy hints from Marvel) and avoided those mistakes. While there is still the occasional joke, they are few and far between; leaving us with a movie that captures the essence of Captain America perfectly. Plus, having a little joke here and there is good to break up the potential monotony of the drama unfolding, I was just glad Cap wasn't the one cracking wise.

Another major difference between this film and the others, is that here we are presented with a hero who always dreamed of doing nothing more than fighting for what's right. In today's comic book movie landscape I can't think of any characters with this mindset. To me this was so refreshing because finally we get to see one of the few characters that's doing precisely what he's always wanted and sought after. As opposed to having the heroic mantle thrust upon him by circumstances (Iron Man or Spider-Man) or being born into it (Thor).

Now, to clarify I am a comic book fan so I already knew that Captain America was one of the few heroes that willingly accepted the heroic mantle placed before him. I just wasn't sure if the movie would keep this aspect intact or change it to be more cookie-cutter and follow the tried-and-true recipe of so many of the other adaptations over the years.

Despite my foreknowledge of that particular character trait for Cap, I still found it a fresh approach to a genre that has so many similarities within origin stories. After all, there are only so many types of origins one can tell before you become repetitive.

One last difference with this film, that I shall touch upon briefly, is that this was a pure origin story from start to finish. With most other comic book films the origin portion of the character's first movie comprises approximately half to two-thirds of the overall running time. This movie doesn't finish Cap's origins for this cinematic universe, meaning taking him from first becoming the hero to being ready for next summer's ""Avengers"", until the credits roll.

This was important because the other Marvel Studios movies featured stories set in the modern day; whereas, Captain America was created during World War II. So, for him to believably fit into the modern day landscape of 2012's ""Avengers"" team-up film, the movie had the unenviable task of introducing the character and doing justice to his time in World War II. All the while, somehow bringing him up to the modern day setting we've become accustomed to with the other films. Not an easy set of tasks, but one that the writers and director Joe Johnston pulled off quite nicely.

Speaking of director Joe Johnston, I was personally a little skeptical when he was handed the reins to this key piece of the ""Avengers"" film puzzle. He's a director that has been hit-and-miss with big budget franchises or franchise makers throughout his entire career.

Sure, he did an admirable job taking over for Steven Spielberg to helm ""Jurassic Park 3"", but even so, the movie wasn't as strong as its predecessors. Most recently he was responsible for what ended up being a snore-fest of a reintroduction to a classic movie monster with last year's ""The Wolfman"". But, after watching this film, I have to say that I don't know if anyone else could have handled the movie any better.

Truth be told, whether you like or dislike some of the movies in Johnston's filmography, one thing is for certain, he may have been preparing for this movie his entire career. With his work on the two movies I mentioned a moment ago, and his history with visual effects during the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, all of that served to prepare him for the numerous action sequences and vast CGI work necessary for bringing such a character to life. But, perhaps the most pivotal point of preparation for him may have occurred during his directorial work on 1990's ""The Rocketeer"".

That film was by no means a financial success, and ultimately failed to kick-start a franchise for Disney. However, the movie's perceived shortcomings were not a fault of the director in my opinion. Reason being, the film was actually quite entertaining, but the marketing done by Disney was poorly planned and failed to really sell audiences on the vast adventure awaiting them inside the theater. Despite all that, the film's retro style, attitude, and timeframe are comparable to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", and may have been the key to Johnston's success on this picture.

Speaking of the film's success, much of the movie's box office victory over the final ""Harry Potter"" installment could easily be laid upon the shoulders of its star, actor Chris Evans. Even though Chris had already become known to comic book fans for his spot-on portrayal of the Human Torch, I personally believe that it will be his performance here, and in the sequels to follow (including ""Avengers""), that Chris will be remembered for in the eyes of comic book fans.

Chris' portrayal is the perfect blend of idealism, strength, honesty, and authority that makes Captain America one of the purest heroes in comics and film. Now, it was a going concern among fans that perhaps Chris was miscast given his penchant for sarcasm. However, for Cap, Chris reportedly chose to remove several humorous lines of dialogue in order to stay true to the character. That choice was one that I personally appreciate, because it shows a respect for the source material; a trait which will always be pivotal to any comic book film's success.

Fighting alongside Chris and serving as a potential love interest for Cap is actress Hayley Atwell (TV's ""The Pillars of the Earth""). Hayley brings a strong sense of authority to the role of Peggy Carter, but with a touch of vulnerability for being a woman amid a predominantly male setting (i.e. fighting in a war). Not to mention, a slight playfulness that belies the soldierly outward appearance and exposes a young woman who would at times like nothing more than to flirt with a guy, namely Steve Rogers/Captain America.

In the other major supporting roles are some terrific actors; such as, Tommy Lee Jones (""The Fugitive""), Stanley Tucci (""The Road to Perdition""), and rising star Dominic Cooper (""Mamma Mia!""). Each of these supporting players is responsible for the film's few humorous bits, while still delivering very entertaining, solid performances.

As always veteran actors Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci elevate any project they appear in, but it is Dominic Cooper that surprises me the most. His portrayal as Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) is great, especially as he infuses shades of Robert Downey, Jr's portrayal of Tony from the two ""Iron Man"" films. For me this nod to his future son's personality further cemented the cohesive nature of these interlinked films that Marvel has been producing over the last few years.

Now, I mentioned that Captain America was a great hero and Chris Evans perfectly captured all of the qualities necessary to make him so; however, every hero is only as great as his villain. For this purpose, actor Hugo Weaving brings the supremely evil and despotic Johann Schmidt, also known as the Red Skull, to sadistic malevolent life.

When playing a character codenamed Red Skull, and one that has the physical qualities to inspire such a moniker, I think it could conceivably tempt an actor to sort of ham it up. Basically, go into a scene-chewing mode as the sneering bad guy who does everything evil just for kicks and all that's missing is a handlebar mustache for him to twirl in his fingers. Thankfully, as with many other potential pratfalls that could have plagued this movie, this one was avoided as well.

Actor Hugo Weaving, who is no stranger to playing a major villain (he was Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"" trilogy), portrays Schmidt in a way that is obviously sinister, but without becoming an over-the-top caricature. This was vital to making his character more believable to audiences given his garish appearance and thirst for other-worldly power beyond belief.

What I mean is that his motives are deeply twisted and malevolent, he is a Nazi after all, but you see the sincerity in how deeply he believes in what he's doing. That he's not just doing these evil things just for the sake of doing them. He has a purpose and he believes it to be right. Thus, as a character he is much more believable, amidst all of the more outlandish elements surrounding him, including his own appearance. Again, just another aspect that was pivotal to making this film work.

After all that being said, as I mentioned earlier, the summer of superheroes definitely ended on a high note. Plus, with a movie this solidly entertaining, featuring a home-grown hero, to bring the season to a close is perfectly fitting.

So, as you have undoubtedly figured out by now, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is an excellent adventure film. And one that serves as a fun throwback to classic escapism from Hollywood's past. The movie easily lives up to its Marvel Studios predecessors and firmly cements this hero from a bygone era's place in this hyper-real cinematic universe that began back in 2008's ""Iron Man"".

""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",1312070400,161,12132,4.942562592047128
4698602,2,B005GYJPYW,"Not as blatantly, ridiculously dumb as ""Thor,"" but -- from start-to-finish -- completely synthetic and artificial and, to me, deeply disappointing.

As a fan of ""The Rocketeer"" I was excited that ""Cap"" would have the same director, but Joe Johnson brings along absolutely none of the spontaneity, breakneck fun or lurking danger of the former film. ""Cap"" is ""The Rocketeer"" completely drained of its essence. The structure is uncertain, the pacing sloppy, the action dull, the logic constantly questionable.

This is a movie just going through the motions, but at the same time it feels like a four-hour film trimmed down to two. Motivations are unclear, questions go unanswered, introductions are set up and then never made. For example: Why have The Howling Commandos appear at all if you're not going to identify them as a unit?

Probably the biggest missed opportunity is the handling of Steve Rogers, who -- thanks to a super-serum and some ""Vita-Ray"" exposure -- goes from 96 pound F-4 weakling to a strapping, totally cut uber-soldier. His ""before"" version is whiny, passive aggressive and seems a bit of a masochist (taking brutal beatings from bullies, diving onto runaway grenades); his ""after"" version never really seems the least bit disoriented, conflicted or even very excited by his transformation. And most importantly we never learn exactly why Rogers was so gung ho to fight in the first place, even though there are countless opportunities for a quick monologue that might explain his passion.

In an effort to seem important, ""Captain America"" clutters itself with World War II-era iconography, but its ""chase-fight-chase-fight-repeat"" train of thought comes from a cut-rate videogame.",1312070400,16,1705,5.257352941176471
4698603,4,B005GYJPYW,"If you've paid attention to the shape of cinema recently, you'd notice that we are sort of living in what we could call ""The Superhero Age"" of cinema. Because starting in 2008, anticipation for the upcoming Avengers movie had started with the stellar flick Iron Man, with the mediocre Incredible Hulk following. Then, of course, in 2010 the just as spectacular as the first Iron Man 2 followed, with the credits holding a teaser for Thor, which would come out this year, with Captain America following just a few months later. That, plus Iron Man 2 held plenty of secrets regarding The Avengers.

And so me, the comic book nerd I am, waited for every movie with great patience, and voila, they were all great... And believe me, Captain America is a fun as hell movie.  While it may not be as great as Thor, it's still plenty of fun to be had, and it's overall a great time. I was initially worried before this though, because for one it was directed by Joe Johnston. And mind you, I've got nothing against the guy. In fact I gave a 5/5 review of his Wolfman remake. It's just that I was worried he couldn't pull it off, and he did it. Another thing is Chris Evans. I thought he was initially too much a bishonen to be convincing, and he surprisingly pulled it off. So in all, I was pleasantly surprised!

The movie, like Iron Man and Thor before it, is more of an origin story. It takes place in 1942 during the second world war, and Steve Richards, a small and skinny shotaro boy with a laundry list of medical problems, has been dying to join the American army, to help serve, and fight for his country. He has been unsuccessful in every attempt, and furthermore, he is completely jealous of his buddy, who is already in the army. One night, he manages to successfully get in, thanks to the help of a German doctor Abraham Erskine, although it isn't without difficulty in training.

However, the handsome and smart, not to mention very tech savvy Howard Stark has a plan for him: a serum that will give him a he'll of a physique, amazing strength, and furthermore turns him into the super soldier under the name Captain America. After this procedure, the transformation into Captain America begins, as he manages to do many things, such as free imprisoned soldiers from the jaws of death, somehow manage to make the smokin' hot British army general Peggy Carter fall for him, and get on the road to overthrowing the evil German doctor Johan Schmitt, who has terrifying plans for the war.

So really, let's begin with the fact that the 3D was surprisingly great. I wasn't going to bother since it was filmed in 2D and converted in post, but reading CinemaBlend's review of the 3D and further research that Joe Johnston had 3D in mind from the very early stages and carefully shot each scene for the 3D convinced me. And yes, it is totally worth it. While it's no Avatar or TRON Legacy, this is the best post conversion I've seen since Piranha 3D. Very few films shot in 3D looked better than this, and that's saying something. Maybe I'm over exaggerating, but if this is a sign of things to come for the current boom of 3D, maybe post conversions in the future could look as great as TRON Legacy or Avatar. So yes, do go for 3D!

As for the film itself, wow. Great performances abounds in the film. I wasn't expecting Chris Evans to be as great as he was, and boy did he thrill. He had great comedic timing, looked the part, played the role just the way you'd expect Captain America to be played. Tommy Lee Jones was great too, and so was Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. The script is very intelligent and filled with humour, action, and great dialogue too. The action as well, is simply amazing! Why can't all action movies be well shot, with camera shots lasting longer than a few seconds? Transformers, despite 3D, still has the quick shots syndrome, so thankfully the action here did not disappoint.

Another surprise is the use of CG is very limited- thank god! The thing about Joe Johnston is that he's been known to use CG sparingly, mixing CG with practical effects. As you could imagine, this film takes place during World War II, and not on Asgard, as well as it doesn't have a man in an iron suit, so for the most part, the effects are practical and in camera. However, when he does use CG, you almost don't notice it, it's that well used. So I gotta say, it's great that we have a blockbuster that makes use of mostly practical effects. Maybe it's just my inner child speaking, as I grew up with a man in a suit playing Chewbacca, or people holding the doors open on the Enterprise to give it the sliding illusion, or Keanu Reeves sitting on a train writing his journal with a map of Europe projected on his face, but I was pleased with this.

If I had one complaint, it's that the movie is slow in a few parts, but that is just a teensy quibble. Otherwise, this movie is a fantastic blockbuster, and a sign of things to come for the Avengers. A total recommend, and I also advise you to stay after the credits, as there's a teaser for The Avengers!

Overall: 8/10

Pros: Captain America is a surprisingly very great superhero action flick, with awesome action and performances by Hugo Weaving and Chris Evans. It also looks great in 3D and makes awesome use of practical effects.

Cons: it is slow in the middle, and Dominic Cooper's underuse is just a teensy bit disappointing.",1312070400,2,5392,4.469512195121951

(Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from ""Last Action Hero"" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.

Of course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.

Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell lead the cast of Captain America: The First Avenger and it's another great movie from Marvel. Captain America finishes the trifecta of this season's excellent Marvel movies that began with Thor and X-Men: First Class. It also sets the stage for next year's Avengers film, to be helmed by BtVS and Dollhouse creator, Joss Whedon. Captain America is a comic book icon, but until now he's appeared in terrible, low budget movies. Captain America: The First Avenger is the first film actually worthy of the icon.

Captain America hits all the high points for a super hero movie, while deftly avoiding the many pitfalls inherent in bringing such an iconic character to the silver screen. It's an origin story, but it doesn't get bogged down in the comic book lore. In fact it cleverly makes light of Cap's hokey comic book origins in a brilliantly self aware bit of movie making. Captain America will be and already is a great success, coming in at number 1 in its opening weekend. This is because in addition to being an action extravaganza, it's very well written and character focused. I had my doubts when I heard Chris Evans was cast in the title role, but he is the perfect Captain America or more precisely he is the perfect Steve Rogers, the incredibly frail kid from Brooklyn who goes on to become a super soldier.

The first half of the movie focuses on Steve Rogers' attempts to volunteer for the U.S. Army in order to do his part to combat the Nazis during World War 2. Steve Rogers is physically unfit for service, but goes from city to city trying to sneak through the army screening process. Even though Steve Rogers is obviously patriotic, his heroic appeal runs much deeper than that. He is the eternal underdog and he naturally understands that it takes more than might to make right. His moral strength is what enables him to stand above dozens of physically stronger men and leads him to be chosen for the Super Soldier program that turns him into Captain America. The writers took an incredibly hokey origin story for the prototypical square jawed action hero and humanized Captain America to the point where Steve Rogers' alter ego takes a back seat to Steve Rogers himself.

As ever, every great hero needs a great villain, and Captain America's nemesis is Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull. Played by Hugo Weaving, who has proven himself an amazing actor even with a mask that completely obscures his face (V for Vendetta). The Red Skull is not misunderstood. He is simply evil. If you have been paying attention to the last few films involving Avengers characters, keep a keen eye out for references to the other films in this series.

Captain America: The First Avenger is every bit as good as Thor. It takes a character who I did not think would translate well to the big screen and makes the transition flawlessly. Great action, a great hero and a sinister villain. Captain America will be enlisting for a second tour of duty in next year's Avengers.",1311984000,6,3047,4.698501872659176
4698607,5,B005GYJPYW,"i was so excited to see this movie, i wished i would of seen the midnight showing. this movie was everything i expected it to be. the origin was excatly like the comic, the actors were awesome. hugo weaving did an excellent red skull and chris evans was fantastic as captain america. this movie was awesome. and the battle between red skull and captain america was outstanding. the only problem i have with this movie is that i wished they wouldof stuck with the original costume but other than that this is my number one superhero movie of the year. marvel you guys did great on coming out with good superhero movies for this year. i do hope that marvel will put out the original captain america movie on dvd soon. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1311897600,11,771,4.398601398601398
4698608,4,B005GYJPYW,"I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations for the Captain America movie. They're tried to adapt it twice before and... well, it was ridiculous. And I'm not just talking about the costume.

So it came as a pleasant surprise that this latest comic book movie is not only better than the previous adaptations of Captain America's story, but is a robust, action-packed thriller in its own right. ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" has an earnest, idealistic tone mingled sometimes poignant realism -- exactly what it needs to have.

The time: World War II. Scrawny asthmatic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) desperately wants to defend his country, but he's too puny to enter the army. Dr. Abraham Erskine sees the goodness and courage in Steve's heart, and enlists him in a top-secret experiment to create a super-soldier. Within minutes, Steve has superhuman strength, speed and big shiny muscles. HOORAY!

Unfortunately, the army seems more interested in using the superpowered Captain America as a mascot than a fighter. Are you really surprised? This is the GOVERNMENT we're talking about.

When Steve learns that his best buddy has been captured by the Nazis, he singlehandedly invades an enemy base and rescues dozens of soldiers. But this brings him to the attention of the Nazi super-science division Hydra, and its malevolent leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) -- who is the only other man as strong as Captain America.

This summer has had a lot of comic book movies -- some were horribly disappointing (""Green Lantern,"" ""Priest"") and some were wonderful (""Thor""). I wasn't entirely sure which kind of movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" would be, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and solidly-plotted it was.

There's also a lot of gritty, smoky action with flying bullets (and shields), fiery explosions, and speeding trains carrying machine-gun robots. But the writers don't neglect the human side of Captain America's story, whether it's his friendship with a fellow soldier or his budding romance with an icy sharpshooter.

My biggest criticism is the MacGuffinness of the subplot MacGuffin, which really doesn't do anything except also be an unnecessary deus ex machina. Really, was there ANY reason for the Odin cube to be in this?

As for the cast, they're uniformly solid. Chris Evans plays Steve as earnest, sweet and loyal, but with iron-clad determination and plenty of courage, and he's backed by excellent performances by Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and a steely-nerved sharpshooting Hayley Atwell. And Hugo Weaving is AWESOME -- this guy can play a Nazi in a red latex mask, and still come across as insanely scary.

""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is a lot like Captain America himself -- robust, action-packed, with a good earnest heart at its core. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1311811200,,2824,5.121739130434783
4698609,5,B005GYJPYW,"Tastefully jingoistic, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" works on many levels. It's the only production I can recall where the movie improved upon the book (in this case, the comics). Among the betterments are giving Cap and Red Skull the same scientific parentage, reflecting the greater reality of the Industrial Revolution. Another is separating Red Skull from Nazi Germany. This accomplishes two things - 1) Gives a contemporary twist by showing the emerging power of small groups of terrorists and the declining threats from nation states. To smuggle this post 9/11 fact into a World War II-period movie is quite a feat of intellectual logistics and 2) Makes all but the most deluded American militarist realize that Nazi Germany was never an existential threat to the United States. Actually, no country has posed a takeover threat to the U.S. since the War of 1812 (but that's a subject for another day).
 Steve Rogers/Captain America (played deftly by Chris Evans) gives us a wonderful window into the appeal of the military and how it draws idealistic young people into its milieu. No, it's not a desire for violence. Its power is rooted in the good impulse of wanting to do one's share as the conversation between Steve and Bucky Barnes reveals. Ed Brubaker, the ingenious writer who has been piloting Captain America comics for the past several years, summarized it well - Director Joe Johnston (with Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee playing The Watcher as executive producer) made changes that advance the spirit of Captain America.
 The producers also reached back to Jim Steranko's excellent late `60s comics series ""Death of Captain America"" in bringing elements of espionage to the movie. Steranko's series featured the organization Hydra. Brilliant stroke by Johnston et al in marrying Red Skull to Hydra.
 Tommy Lee Jones is at his gruff silver screen best. He gets to drive the big car and deliver the movie's best line.  Steve's interactions with Peggy Carter and Bucky are genuine and compelling and make the end of the movie sad on a heroic note - unusual for this genre.
 It appears Cap is going to be lumped with his Tales of Suspense comics partner Iron Man and others in ""The Avengers"" next summer. My impulse is to call this a mistake (although if ""The Avengers"" has the same creative team as ""Captain America,"" I'll probably be proved wrong). The Man Out of Time canvas (which was painted on in Cap comics in the 1990s by Mark Waid) will be cluttered if the Star Spangled Banger becomes part of a team of superheroes. Let Cap be Cap. There are plenty of vines left hanging with Bucky (several Winter Soldier comic hints dropped in Cap the movie) and Peggy for Steve to swing on. Bring in Nick Fury to play off Cap (a la Jones' Colonel Phillips). By the way, was that eye-patch wearing Samuel L. Jackson entering at film's end supposed to be Fury or perhaps The Falcon?
 Cap needs to work out his new reality in the spotlight alone. For humorous effect Anthony Weiner could explain to fellow Brooklynite Steve Rogers what Twitter is. Dr. Erskine chose Steve for his courage and compassion. The next chapter of the story should be about whether or not those attributes stand the test of time.",1311811200,,3218,4.820652173913044
4698610,4,B005GYJPYW,"There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in ""Captain America"" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his ""Captain America,"" before and after the transformation.

As summer blockbusters go, ""Captain America"" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.

And the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.

Joe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.

Likewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.

4698611,5,B005GYJPYW,"I give this movie adaptation the highest rating possible the story line is spot on for the character even better than the original comics, the introduction of the cosmic cube so early on is a real bonus and I can foresee the return of the RED SKULL in the Avengers movie, the only thing that bothers me is with the re-imieagination of Thor I am willing to bet the cosmic cube gets written in as an lost Asgardian piece of super science and will likely dovetail into Starks last power upgrade from the last Iron Man movie where the ring was removed in place of the triangle. Mark my words 2011-07-27 lets see how close I get.

Back to this movie: It was hard for me to believe what a solid performance the former Human Torch Actor pulled off in his role of Captain America, I loved the inclusion of the Howling Commandoes too bad they did not put Tommy Lee Jones in the part of Colonel Nick Furry I rather think it was kind of assumed to some degree that the older fans would place him in that position anyway in our hearts.

Too bad they decided to use Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury once they did that it made it hard to go back to the original mold of the character. I loved the lead actress she looked just like the pictures of my Grandmother from the 40'.

The portrayal of the 40's was awesome they really did an excellent job of capturing the flavor and the feel of the times.

The character who played the Red Skull did a superb job. He was born for the role just like Arnold was born to play Conan.

 All in all I really, really enjoyed this film and have already signed up to be notified when it is available for purchase.

The best Movie of Summer 2011!",1311724800,3,1660,4.217665615141956
4698612,4,B005GYJPYW,"This movie gets better every time I watch it. When I first saw it, I thought it didn't have enough action and started out pretty slow. But the more I see it, I appreciate it more. The action scenes were pretty awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.)

Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the ""Super-Soldier"" experiment. He soon becomes tall and muscular and becomes a national treasure as 'Captain America' with an awesome motorcycle and bulletproof American flag shield. He must stop Red Skull from destroying the world with a cubed jewel. If you enjoy Marvel Comic movies, you might enjoy CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER!!!",1311638400,,886,4.67948717948718
4698613,5,B005GYJPYW,"I really enjoyed the Captain America film.  I've read most of the Kirby-inspired comics and his adventures in the modern times, but the film takes place when Captain America was first scripted, during the days of World War II.

In the 1940s comic book companies wrote plenty of patriotic stories and encouraged their readers to buy war bonds and even to (sadly) donate their comics collections and have them pulped for the war effort (painful to type that).

Story & Plot:

Great themes in this story.  A man who was born weak and asthmatic whose best friend is going off to war.  Steve Rogers wants to go along but has been 4-F'd several times.  A casual conversation with Rogers and gang is overheard by a professor Abraham who encourages Rogers to be the guinea pig in an experiment that would create super soldiers.

Meanwhile another man, ostensibly fighting for the Nazi's, has his own plans.  He too has been subjected to an earlier form of the super soldier serum.  But Schultz, now super-sized, becomes the Red Skull and his minions of Hydra wish nothing less than world conquest.

The clash between the Red Skull and Captain America is palpable with emotion.  The good guy gets his lumps; the bad guy retreats in defeat.

War!

Several scenes were memorable:  The experiment that made a skinny runt into a tall, handsome super-soldier is relegated to selling war bonds and basically being made fun of.  He's made into a symbol by Madison Avenue.  They even make comic books out of him - such irony.  The silly costume and the dancing girls are the icing on the cake.

We have a version of the Howling Commandoes here as they are led by a new Captain America and he gives the Red Skull a bloody nose in several battles - the Captain with his shield and the Red Skull with his new laser weapons, powered by a technology that may have come from ""the treasure room of Odin.""

Bottom Line:  I've read some reviews of fans who were disappointed, but they just don't get that this is an adaptation of the comics - that it must be altered for those who have never heard of Captain America and are unfamiliar with his story.  The World War II angle with the Nazi's was necessary as that's when the Captain was first formed.

And who would not want to see a few Nazi's burned, huh?

A combination of an Indiana Jones-type thriller and the sensibility of Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow, a must-watch for comics fans and friends of fantasy.",1311638400,2,2443,4.563218390804598
4698614,5,B005GYJPYW,"Before I begin anything if you haven't seen this yet stay after the credits as there is a end credit ""scene"" as with other Marvel films BUT with this one we also get a sneak peak of the 2012 ""The Avengers"".

This isn't Captain America's first dance; the comic book has been adapted a number of times for the big and small screen; Cap first appeared on screen in 1944, the 1960's cartoon TV series, two 1979 TV movies (which were pilots for a series), a 1990 movie (which, somehow, thankfully I missed)and this the latest incarnation of Cap and the best version yet.

Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer"", ""Jurassic Park III"")does an excellent job of evoking the period feeling in this origin story that also allows Cap to transition to the 21st century for forthcoming ""The Avengers"" movie.

SPOILERS:

The plot: It's World War II--Steve Rogers (Chris Evans)continues to try and enlist to serve his country but is constantly rejected because of his weight and various illnesses. Dr. Abraham Erksine (Stanley Tucci) thinks he is the perfect candidate for his ""super soldier"" serum that will create a stronger, faster superhuman perfected after it was first used on Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt turned into a monster--known as the Red Skull who also commands Hitler's elite Hydra group. Roger's volunteers, undergoes the treatment and lives up to Erksine's dream. At first confined to Bond selling events as Captain America by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) the military head of the program, Rogers goes into action when his best friend ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan)is taken by Schmidt's men along with the rest of the 107th division.

END OF SPOILERS:

Evans does a superb job of balancing Cap's humanity with a generous dose of humor avoiding a campy tone. Packed with terrific supporting performers ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" stands as one of the best Marvel films made (along with the first two ""Spider-Man"" films by Sam Raimi, the ""Iron Man"" films by Jon Favreau and the first two ""X-Men"" films by Bryan Singer)continuing a winning streak for the studio.

The direction by Johnston nicely balances the story and characterization with the stunts and action sequences of the film. Using a modern rap around sequence does a nice job of bridging the era the bulk of the film takes place in and bringing it into the 21st century for the next film.

Shot in 3D (rather than being a conversation after the fact)enhances the film although it isn't necessary to see the film in that format to enjoy it. Still, Johnston makes excellent use of the 3D format without bashing the audience over the head with it and, unlike most movies, Johnston doesn't adjust his cutting style for the 3D format (3D doesn't handle rapid fire editing all that well)but then again his editing style here echoes an earlier era of film.

Highly recommended.",1311552000,,2846,4.9002079002079
4698615,4,B005GYJPYW,"So first off, let me say that this movie was really fun! I'd been looking forward to it since I first saw the trailers over a month ago. The story line surrounding Captain America is golden. I love the idea that the guy who really loves his country and wants to do good is given the chance to be superior than everyone else who had frowned upon him in the past. I think that the CG for Steve Rogers before becoming Captain America was amazing. He really looks like he is 90 lbs, which makes the transformation really drastic. However, I was a little bit disappointed in the action CG ( such as when he is jumping on things and and punching people out) because it looks a little bit fake, but the acting is really good, so you kinda don't have too long to think about it. The attention to detail was really great, especially the costumes and makeup, which all look WW2 period.
I must say that there were some things that I would change. In the preview there is a clip of Captain America storming his way through a set of double doors with his team and shooting everywhich way, which i was really excited about, but that bit ended up being part of a montage, which disappointed me. I think that a lot of the technology was far to extensive and advanced for WW, but we are talking about a movie where a guy gets injected with super-human-serum, so I was okay with it. The actors and actresses were amazing and all very believable, also there is plenty of suspense, humor and heart in this movie. I think that I'll buy it when it comes out even though there were some things that I would have changed. Overall, really fun movie!
Stay for all of the credits, there is a really good extra at the end :)",1311552000,3,1696,4.286604361370716
4698616,5,B005GYJPYW,"After a hell of a lot of hype, Captain America: The First Avenger is finally in theaters. It delivers on the hype and goes even beyond that, turning star Chris Evans into a bona fide leading man. Captain America is among the best of the comic book movies released this summer. It's a lot better than Green Lantern, a bit better than Thor, but not quite on the level of X-Men: First Class.

The trail to The Avengers is blazed by director Joe Johnston, and he and Chris Evans bring style and substance to a character that I previously couldn't give a damn about. I've always thought of Cap as just a bit too hokey, too much of a cookie-cutter symbol of USA patriotism and old-timey square-jawed superheroes. I remember smiling when I learned that Evans was cast in the role; if anyone could bring genuine charisma to the character of Steve Rogers, it was the former Johnny Storm (and Lucas Lee!).

The  film starts out in a barren arctic landscape, where a group of government officials have discovered something buried. The site is excavated, and before Cap's shield is discovered, my brother turned to me and asked, ""Are we in the right movie?""

Then the film smash cuts to WWII-era New York City, where we meet our hero Steve Rogers for the first time. If you haven't seen the trailers (unlikely), you will be taken aback a bit by the CG wizardry put to work to attach the always-buff Evans' head to a seriously scrawny, short body. Even as a gaunt  punching bag, Evans imbues his character with a likability that is integral throughout the movie. With a lesser actor in the lead, this movie wouldn't be half as good.

We are shown Rogers' undying patriotism as he continually applies to be shipped overseas as a soldier. He is constantly turned down due to his tiny physical stature and myriad health problems. He is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while talking to his buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and defending his drive to join the army. Dr. Erskine sees unwavering spirit of Rogers, and offers him a chance to fight for his country- a serum that he has designed, which can turn an ordinary man into the perfect soldier. Tucci does a great job making Dr. Erskine feel like a person, not a throwaway character, in the short screen time he is given. He believes in Rogers, and Steve spends the rest of the movie trying to live up to his expectations and make him proud.

Dr. Erskine tells the story of Dr. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), also known as The Red Skull and Cap's main enemy in this movie. Dr. Erskine's super soldier serum was discovered by Schmidt, who, as a power hungry man, demanded to be the first test subject. It turns out that the serum brings out the inner qualities of the man; a good man's qualities become better, while in the case of The Red Skull, he was horribly disfigured. Ever since Erskine defected to the US, Schmidt has tried to track him down and kill him, because he knows that if he is able to make another super soldier, it will be the one thing capable of stopping his plans for global domination.

Tommy Lee Jones is great as an Army Colonel that continually tears down Steve Rogers both before and after his superhero transformation. Hayley Atwell plays the romantic interest, and has great chemistry with Evans. Her character is there to comfort Steve when he is distraught about the fact that, after his transformation, he is relegated to putting on a silly spandex costume (the original Captain America uniform) and parading around in a stage show to help sell war bonds (some of the funniest scenes in the movie happen here). After being booed, humiliated and lambasted by troops serving in Italy, he decides enough is enough and to go on a one-man mission to rescue P.O.W.'s at a nearby camp, and finally gain the respect of his fellow soldiers.

After that, the movie is mostly just about Captain America taking down Red Skull, until a heartstring-pulling ending that sets up The Avengers. All in all, it was a great summer popcorn flick, and a real star-making vehicle for Chris Evans. Marvel has done a great job in casting all of the Avengers, and it's one more movie I can't wait for next summer. Great job, Marvel.",1311552000,13,4193,4.609919571045577

4698618,5,B005GYJPYW,"""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is right up there with 2008's Iron Man (and might even surpass it) as Marvel's best movie and it may well be one of the best superhero films ever. There is something about the superhero film that makes it a special genre in my heart and I am in love with the mythology of these characters. This is my first review on Amazon and I normally wouldn't go through the time to write a review but this movie is worth it. You all know the plot synopsis, so I won't repeat it here. But it is absolutely safe to say that this an excellent, fun, and amazing movie. First off, the cast is top-notch and, as Chris Evans (who is without a doubt the best of the bunch) said in a recent interview, ""there is literally not a weak link in the chain"". As I stated above, Chris Evans really shines, no, EXPLODES, in his role as Steve Rogers/ Captain America. I have never seen an actor embody a superhero role as greatly as Chris does. If there is one thing Marvel Studios has gotten pitch perfect in all of their films, it is the character development and casting of its lead actors, from Robert Downey Jr. who made Tony Stark one of the greatest film characters of all time to Chris Hemsworth who came out of nowhere and made the role of Thor really stand out as he embodied that character. But this isn't a review for those films, this is a review for Captain America and Evans has succeeded on all levels. I, and just about everyone else in the audience in my packed theater, fell in love with his character from when he first started out as ""skinny Steve"" (through the use of some pretty impressive special effects) to after the Super Soldier transformation. You can really identify with him and you can feel empathy towards his actions and his personality. Suffice to say, he has made Captain America my personal favorite superhero.
The other cast members are amazing as well. Hayley Atwell really makes a splash as British SSR officer Peggy Carter and the romance that develops between her and Steve is both believable and heartwarming. Every superhero movie has to have romance in it (it is a staple of the genre, after all) and the romance in this movie is one of the genre's best, not to mention Agent Carter is a kick-ass, strong-willed character who Atwell portrays pitch perfectly. Hugo Weaving as Cap's nemesis Johann Schmidt/ The Red Skull is both menacing (thanks to some cool and pretty impressive make-up effects) and downright evil. He stands out in all the scenes he's in and you really couldn't imagine a more perfect choice for Cap's arch enemy as Hugo portrays the character with a great German accent perfectly. That's a word that I associate with this movie a lot: perfect. I have come to believe that the word does not exist and has no meaning to it but I feel that this movie is as close as it could get to fulfiiling my expectations and more.
Now the other supporting cast members are scene-stealers in their own right. Sebastian Stan is a great friend and a great sidekick to Cap and he really does a fantastic job in his role. He isn't in the movie enough, but when he is, you can't help but like his character. His performance gets me really excited for the ensured sequels where he returns as the Winter Soldier. Other supporting cast members include Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Chester Phillips who provides a lot of great humor and good ol' American behavior as arguably the number one scene stealer and Stanley Tucci puts his best German accent to good use as the relatable and caring Dr. Abraham Erskine, who creates the Super Soldier serum. Dominic Cooper makes the role of Howard Stark is own by playing the character his own personal way and not mirroring RDJ's performance. Lastly is Toby Jones as The Red Skull's assisstant and a classic Captain America villain in his own right, Arnim Zola, who I hope to see more of in future Cap movies as well, as he gives a great performance in the movie.
Now on to the action sequences. There are four major action sequences in the movie (the Heinz Krueger chase through Brooklyn, the HYDRA factory rescue mission, the high-speed train sequence, and the finale at Schmidt's HYDRA base and in the air on the giant Valkyrie warship which is by far the best, and not to mention the cool montage of Captain America and the Howling Commandoes taking out all of the HYDRA bases). Joe Johnston, the director who I am finally complementing for his superb job, stages these action sequences in a nostalgic, old-fashioned way that ironically is a breath of fresh air in today's virtual Hollywood blockbuster industry. He really was the best choice to direct this movie, as his special effects work on movies such as the Star Wars series and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", both of which are paid homage to in this movie, as well as his period movies ""The Rocketeer"" and ""October Sky"" have prepared him to make this movie. Speaking of period pieces.....
The best part to me personally about this whole movie was the production design and the cinematography. The 1940's setting is absolutely amazing and it really stands out with the coloring of the browns in Brooklyn, the grays in Europe, and the red, white, and blue of Captain America's costume. You really feel as if you are being transported to that time period and I can only hope that ""Captain America 2"" has flashbacks to this timeless decade. I mean, really, the period setting and filming style of this film was just knocked out of the park. The bookend scenes in the present day were done well too, especially the ending scene when Steve finds himself in modern day Times Square, New York City. This was just such a cool contrast to the rest of the movie, which may sound like a detriment to the film but it was really well done and I liked it.
In closing, I give no higher honor than to a movie like ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" as being my first movie review. This film was old-fashioned, exhilariting, beautiful, was filled with fine performances (especially by Chris Evans who deserves all the praise he will recieve), and was one of the most amazing superhero films I have ever seen. Steve Rogers is an inspiring character and Alan Silvestri's patriotic score that plays over the credits gives support to this and to an awesome film-going experience. I have signed up to be notified when this movie is released on home video as I would love to add it to my own personal collection. I also look forward to seeing more of Evans as Steve (my new favorite superhero) in next year's ""The Avengers"" (that trailer looked awesome, by the way) and in the inevitable ""Captain America"" sequels.

Due to the last several movies we have seen in 3d not being very impressive & the cost of 3d, we chose not to see the 3d version of the film.

Both my daughter & I really enjoyed this movie, and would gladly watch it again!!!

This movie is Fantasic & Works in many ways!
Chris Evans did an amazing job as the Captain, despite me previously hearing from others that he wouldnt work well, due to him being another super hero in The Fantastic Four movies.

Tommy Lee Jones was the same as he is in nearly all his other movies. He just makes his character stand out & he contributes to Evans mastery of his role.
All the actors in this film also do an excellent job in their respective roles.

I just love the fact that this movie was set in the time period it was set in.
My dad is not big movie guy & he hates to go to the theater, but because of the time period the movie was set in, I believe he would really enjoy & relate to this super hero movie, over some of the other ones.

The Villian, ""the red skull"" is the original villian of course for the Captain, and is the perfect advisary in this movie just like the comics.

The strong role & appearances of Stark really add Flare to the movie as well!
You will get a kick out of watching him, just being him!!!

This movie has plenty of action & flows at a steady pace, while also having some drama, some humor & you could say it has a bit of a love story as well.

I give this movie an A+
It isn't the best super hero movie ever, or the best one I have seen, but IT IS REAL & BELIEVABLE!!!
REAL & BELIEVABLE are the words that make the difference in this movie and really sell it!!!

Thanks for reading my review & I hope you enjoy this movie!!!
P.S. stay through the credits!!!",1311379200,5,1908,4.023809523809524
4698620,3,B005GYJPYW,"I was pretty happy with this 2011 Marvel Comics release in the theaters.  It was no award winner--just good entertainment and on an incredibly humid 105 degree day in Baltimore (yuk).  I don't remember any foul language either.  It was a war movie, so people got shot and killed everywhere, but they did not focus on blood and guts, thank God!  I saw it in 3D, but I don't believe the 3D really added much.

Steve Rogers, from Brooklyn NY, is a guy who wants to join the military and serve his country so bad he can taste it.  It is March, 1942, so WWII is going strong.  Steve is pretty small and ""puny,"" and gets rejected 4F every time he applies.  He is in the right place at the right time when a scientist overhears him about to apply again and decides Steve is perfect for a secret government experiment.  Steve is classified 1A by Dr Abraham, given a special serum injection, and he becomes a lean-mean (muscular) fighting machine.  His metabolism is about 4 times faster than other guys, his muscles are expanded at the cellular level, and he can run fast as heck, jump on top of taxis, and stuff like that.  We are told early on that the puny guy was selected because he had a good heart and the serum amplifies the inner characteristics a person already has.  Initially, Steve becomes part of a War Bond show for the army, but as you would have guessed anyway, soon finds a way to get in the war.

The evil force is Nazi Johann Schmidt (aka Red Skull), who is looking for a way to win the war for Germany and Herr Hitler.  Tommy Lee Jones is a military commander, also involved in the secret project, and as always, is exceptionally good in his role.  Federal Agent Peggy provides an Army Girl presence, quite capable of kicking butt. There is also a pleasing innocence about Steve's character.

Lots of action--It is probably more of a ""guy"" movie (generally) because it is primarily a war movie.",1311379200,2,1907,4.436781609195402
4698621,4,B005GYJPYW,"Captain America: The First Avenger is pretty much just a character introduction for the upcoming Avengers movie, but I liked it better than two of the other big superhero films this year, The Green Lantern and even the very well reviewed Thor. I liked the fact that it was set during WWII, which made this comic book adaptation unique, and it has a fair amount of humor that never seemed forced.

The acting is better than you would expect thanks to a surprisingly restrained performance from Chris Evans as Captain America and a scene stealing Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving does his usual good job as the villain Red Skull, but I didn't find him to be menacing enough to stand out from all the other comic book baddies. Still, he always plays the evil roles so well. Hayley Atwell, who I had previously seen in the TV miniseries The Pillars of the Earth, is not only gorgeous, but a better than average love interest. She actually fights, rather than just standing around looking pretty.

There is a lot of CGI and most of it looks good, especially the scrawny version of Chris Evans, but thankfully it is not overused like in The Green Lantern.

The only negatives would be that it does drag a little in spots and the hero himself doesn't have any cool powers (like The X-Men) or any cool gadgets (like Batman), other than a kicka** shield that can be thrown like a boomerang. He is just stronger and faster thanks to an experiment that turns a 90 pound weakling into a 220 pound beat down machine.

I had fun with this one. Not quite as good as X-Men: First Class, but on a weekend as hot as this you could do worse things than spending two hours in a abnormally chilly theater.",1311379200,,1681,4.465798045602606
