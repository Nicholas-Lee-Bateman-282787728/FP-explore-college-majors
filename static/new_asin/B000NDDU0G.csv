8176815,5,B000NDDU0G,Great movie,1463616000,,11,5.0
8176816,5,B000NDDU0G,"Saw this movie on TCM 10 years ago and am happy to see that it was released on DVD. Gene Tierney is as gorgeous as ever. This movie reminded me of ""The Lady Eve"" with Henry Fonda playing opposite Barbara Stanwyck. Same snapping dialog and quick moving scenes.",1382313600,3,259,4.416666666666667
8176817,5,B000NDDU0G,"I hadn't seen these two paired until I saw this movie. Fonda and Tierney make a charming pair. He plays a CPA totally blinded by his love for her, she plays the girl in trouble.  Who knew Gene Tierney could be so funny? The scene where she arranges to have him win back his money in the casino is hilarious as he tries to rationalize his winning streak. Many great scenes, interesting villains, funny dialogue and great suspense. Fun.",1358640000,3,434,4.493670886075949
8176818,3,B000NDDU0G,"OK light comedy, pales in comparison to Preston Sturges sparkling ""The Lady Eve"" of the year before (both films have similar story).Though Gene Tierney is beautiful, she has nowhere near the presence nor comedic depth of Miss Stanwyck of The Lady Eve. Even Henry Fonda is not as good as in the earlier film.",1358380800,3,307,4.703703703703703
8176819,3,B000NDDU0G,"A pair of con artists (Laird Cregar, Spring Byington) take a young shopgirl (Gene Tierney) under their wing and passing themselves off as society people use the girl as bait to hook wealthy men and then swindle them. But when they swindle a young man (Henry Fonda) on vacation, it backfires when he and Tierney fall in love. This lackluster attempt at a romantic screwball comedy has its modest charms. Its relatively brief running time doesn't allow it to wear out its welcome and Tierney is charming though lacking in comic timing and Fonda, as he proved in THE LADY EVE (which the film resembles), makes for an endearing nerd. But it's not very fresh or original. The director Rouben Mamoulian (QUEEN CHRISTINA) nudges it along as best he can but it's a highly forgettable piece. With Shepperd Strudwick, Henry Stephenson and Iris Adrian.

The Fox MOD DVD-r is a pristine B&W transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio.",1346976000,,925,4.817610062893082
8176820,4,B000NDDU0G,"These Fox Cinema Archive discs vary in quality, but this is one of the really good looking ones.  It appears they went back to film elements to do their video transfer as the image has rich contrast levels and excellent detail.  Projected onto a 10' screen, the picture quality holds up and is very ""film-like"" in appearance.  The film itself is also a lot of fun.  Very highly recommended!",1345075200,19,390,4.608695652173913
8176821,4,B000NDDU0G,"Lighthearted romp with the always dependable Henry Fonda, and the lovely Gene Tierney, who is always a feast for the eyes. The dvd quality is very good, but as with most mod titles could be better. Recommended",1344643200,3,209,4.675675675675675
8176822,5,B000NDDU0G,I was really pleased to see this was released on DVD.  Starring a very young and lovely Gene Tierney and Henry Fonda as her likeable beau this story of con artists spinning their web takes some hilarious turns.  Spring Byington and Laird Cregar are great as the sneaky duo who use Tierney's charms to swindle young men.  There are a number of tense moments that leave you routing first for the con men then for the sweethearts.  It would be very hard to dislike this one if you are into romantic comedies or any of the primary actors.  It has to be one of Gene Tierney's best early roles.,1344211200,14,588,4.3577981651376145
8176823,5,B000NDDU0G,"I love watching the old movies, from back when people could really act and the story involved more than umpteen explosions.
Start with a simple salesgirl (the beautiful Gene Tierney).  Add two darling rogues who live off rich friends (and sometimes a little more).  Simmer for a couple of years (movie time, of course).
Enter Henry Fonda, a cautious mathematically gifted accountant who is mistakenly targeted by the terrible trio.  Cupid, however, is even more accurate.
Want to know the end?  Watch the movie...",1238630400,17,513,5.071428571428571
