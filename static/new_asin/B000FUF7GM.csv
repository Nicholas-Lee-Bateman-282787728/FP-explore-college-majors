2589390,5,B000FUF7GM,"If you love The Who or bass guitar you'll probably like this DVD about the life and music of John Entwhistle, one of the greatest musicians ever to pick up a bass guitar and the cornerstone of The Who's sound.

Of particular interest to bassists are the musical clips which have been tastefully remixed to emphasize Entwhistle's playing.

A friend of mine loaned me this disc and after watching it I ordered my own copy. I'm not usually much of one for rock biographies but this one's a keeper!",1340496000,,494,4.53932584269663
2589391,3,B000FUF7GM,"I could live with being the least popular member of the Who, and I'm guessing fans of that great band gravitated more to drummer Keith Moon, guitarist Pete Townsend and vocalist Roger Daltrey than they did bassist John Entwistle. Even Entwistle, who died in 2002, deemed himself ""the Quiet One."" Nonetheless, he deserves no less attention than he receives in the fine 2006 documentary AN OX'S TALE: THE JOHN ENTWISTLE STORY.

AN OX'S TALE reminds us that John Entwistle, while he certainly earned his share of the credit for the Who's success, was more responsible than anyone for enriching the use of bass guitar.  Musicologists, please correct me if this film and I are wrong, but until Entwistle and the Who hit it big how many records did you note for their bass?  Sure, James Jamerson and Paul McCartney came before the Who and while they may have cracked opened the door for creative bassists, didn't Entwistle then kick it down?

It is unfortunate that Who singer Roger Daltrey is not among the AN OX'S TALE interview subjects, which include Chris Squier of Yes, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, and Pete Townshend.  Daltrey's vocals on Entwistle compositions such as ""Trick of the Light,"" ""Had Enough,"" ""It's Your Turn,"" and ""You"" made for contributions that held their own alongside the many great Townshend songs on those Who albums.  But I don't want to assume Daltrey refused to participate, because AN OX'S TALE seems low-budget and the time and money necessary to talk to everyone may not have been available to the filmmakers. I mean, it probably isn't too hard to get an interview with Kenny Jones and Zak Starkey, the Who drummers who followed the late Keith Moon, but they do not appear in the film, either.

AN OX'S TALE: THE JOHN ENTWISTLE STORY tells us John Entwistle was nicknamed ""Ox"" not because of his imposing build but rather his durability, being a man who could hold liquor like he held his bass guitar.  See this documentary to learn a little more about this extraordinary artist we lost too soon.

While I never picked up another John Entwistle solo album, for three decades and counting I've always caught some grooves listening to his 1981 release TOO LATE THE HERO.  That might have made a better title for this film, though I can understand why they went with AN OX'S TALE.  Other musicians were in the spotlight more and while it's too late for John Entwistle, his talent was heroic.",1334102400,,2414,4.751196172248804
2589392,3,B000FUF7GM,"I really enjoy The Who, and thus I enjoyed watching this video (compliments of my Prime membership) about the quiet band member, John Entwistle.  If you're not a fan of The Who, then I really doubt you will find much of anything in this film interesting.  Also, it's not as if the film making itself is anything noteworthy either, so you won't miss anything there.  With all due respect, there wasn't all that much interesting about John.  He is arguably the best bass player ever, but outside of that his life was rather ordinary.  I found it a bit sad that a part of the film was about his possessions instead of what he had done.  By far the most interesting part of the film was the significant dislike of each other by John and Roger.  Seems it was so bad that Roger didn't even make an appearance in this film to offer even the slightest of kind words for John.  The biggest treat of the movie was my learning of John's song ""Back on the Road"" which ran over the closing credits.  Was not familiar with that one, but I immediately enjoyed it.",1298678400,,1048,4.360824742268041
2589393,4,B000FUF7GM,"I enjoyed it for the most part.

Not that this is a 'for bass players by bass players' film but I did feel puzzled by some of the cameos(Robin Zander?NOTE:I'm a Cheap Trick fan). Not 'bad' just unexpected. Hey, whatever...

The only thing that got to me was the criticism by Jim Ladd(?SP) towards The Who for continuing the tour following Entwistles passing. I may not be an authority on The Who but one thing seemed pretty clear: John Entwistle loved to perform and tour. 'He'd play at the opening of an envelope' was the quote if I'm not mistaken. So, if they could have asked him what to do, I'd like to think he'd have said 'Do you even have to ask?' I thought by The who playing they enabled more people to join in and honor his memory by doing what he would have loved to do if he could've himself. Perhaps even his absence on the stage further served to remind people of his impact.

Hopefully, someday someone'll get it together to make 'A Moon's(Loon's)Tale'",1277856000,,967,4.421348314606742
2589394,4,B000FUF7GM,"Sometimes what is not said speaks louder than the story that is told.  Aside from the underlying causes of John's premature death, what scars this fine film and tribute to an extraordinary musician is what was not said and by whom.  The lifestyle of rockstars -- drugs and drink, etc. --leads to bad and foolish behavior; that much is certain.  But bad character is another matter and bad character is what is shown here, not by John or Pete, but by the glaring, conspicuous absence of Roger Daltry.  Whatever personal differences Roger may have had with John pale when compared to the loss of a gifted, humble man who was his fellow band member for decades and one of the greatest bass players in the history of rock.  While the brilliant but hyperneurotic Pete was open and frank, Daltry's total silence went beyond disrespect to sink into the nadir of insensitivity and crassness.  I came away from this documentary with nothing but respect for John and nothing but contempt for Roger Daltry.",1227484800,,995,4.755813953488372
2589395,3,B000FUF7GM,"First, I'll cut to the chase - I'd buy this again. The show was well worth watching. Nothing really new, but it is nice to have a DVD that is about John, not about The Who with bits about John. It contains nice interviews with his son and others. A few good shorts of John with his band, and although he looks ill in his interviews, that is one of the high 'bits' as it were - he never shows regrets, but he sure seems to have enjoyed the ride.",1208908800,,444,3.9444444444444446
2589396,2,B000FUF7GM,"I would have thought this would be a great production. Should'a started with booming bass and great licks...but terrible grainy footage, not even artsy...just crumby. My eyes still hurt. Couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. Yeah, I'll go back and watch the whole thing, but I'm not jumping at it.",1186790400,,299,4.882352941176471
2589397,5,B000FUF7GM,"I was lucky enough to see The Who twice while growing up. They certainly were a force to be reckoned with. This DVD provides us with a side of John that wasn't accessible to the media at large -- you see him from the point of view of the people who knew him, worked with him, and loved him. The interview footage with Pete is priceless. Notable (for reasons beyond me), is the complete absence of Roger in this biography. If you love The Who, buy it  and enjoy it -- you won't regret it.",1171843200,,487,4.126315789473685
2589398,5,B000FUF7GM,Not only do you get to know the greatest basist of all time but you also learn of his interpersonal relationships with the origional members of The Who and the chemistry that bonded them.,1168905600,,187,4.529411764705882
2589399,5,B000FUF7GM,"If you're reading this review, you must be an Entwistle fan.  In that case, you need this well presented collection of interviews and biographical info on John Entwistle.  There are interviews with Pete Townsend, Allison, Chris, and Queenie Entwistle as well as others who were close to JE, both with the Who as well as the John Entwislte Band.  The bonus clip of BORIS THE SPIDER forom a Detroit performance is nearly worth the price of admission by itself.

While you're at it, get THUNDERFINGERS and MASTER CLASS.  Get the latter even if you don't play bass.  There are insights into Entwistle that even a non-bass player can learn from.",1168732800,,640,4.7727272727272725
2589420,5,B000FUF7GM,"That John Entwistle has been named ""bassist of the millennium"" should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with his music both as a solo performer and as an integral, unmistakable and unequalled musical force with The Who.

John Entwistle, The Ox, as he was affectionately known by his friends and fans alike, was a gifted and original rock and roll bass player who helped to pioneer a style of playing and a sound that has influenced generations of musicians.

An Ox's Tale is a well constructed, very entertaining depiction of The Ox's life as delivered to you by rock and roll greats including Pete Townshend, Roger Glover, Billy Squier and Peter Frampton. The narrative is fantastically supported by previously unseen footage of John in both live performance and interview. For fans of a good story, great bass guitar and solid ground-breaking rock and roll, An Ox's Tale should prove to be both entertaining and illuminating viewing.

An Ox's Tale was to this Who fan, a thoroughly enjoyable depiction of John Entwistle's life, his contribution to rock and roll and his legacy to popular music. This DVD provides a real insight to the life and genius that was the late, great John Entwistle.",1168732800,,1198,4.891625615763547
2589421,5,B000FUF7GM,Great in-depth look into his life and music. A must for any serious bassist or Who fan.,1168387200,,87,4.176470588235294
2589422,1,B000FUF7GM,"I am a big WHO fan so it is hard for me not to like anything on the WHO. I purchase the Ox Tale about a month ago. I though it was great. Good insight into WHO John was. Some excellent interviews with John, Pete and others who were near to him. The only disappointing part I found was that Roger was not in it at all. I know Johns and Roger had an ongoing issue on stage with John's volume. Thought that to be a bit strange. Worth buying for any WHO fan.",1168300800,,454,3.8404255319148937
2589423,5,B000FUF7GM,"Being that I am a huge WHO fan and a bass player who was influenced by John Entwistle, I was very eager to get my hands on this DVD and when I did I was not disappointed.  A great film that covers the life of the OX, goes into his personal life, his home and his solo projects.  Too many who books and films revolve around Pete Townsend and I was happy to finally see something on John Entwistle because he deserved it.  Any who fan, bass player or aspiring musician will like this film.",1162771200,,487,4.105263157894737
2589424,3,B000FUF7GM,"It's good that one of rock's gladiator's is given a musical tribute. There is not enough visual testamony to the creators from those prolific decades, starting in 60's. It is sad that so many artists, burnt out in their prime like Morrison, Joplin, Hendrix and yet, it's even perhaps more sad, that we lose a performer who had more time, to get straight and ""get it right."" Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, and many others indeed, swore off hard drink and hard drugs after youthful exploratory misadventures and still perform as they get on in years. The lesson here should be, strive to fight toxic lifestyles. A little rust is better than self distruction.

Old man time, can be kind. Four strings down.",1160784000,,702,4.754098360655738
2589425,4,B000FUF7GM,"The Townshend interviews are outstanding. He is relaxed and funny and doesn't need to make any grand statements or generalizations. Frampton's narration is a bit stiff, you can tell he is reading words he isn't really comfortable with. The Doors' Ray Manzarek, however, is a complete idiot here. He tries to look wide-eyed but is actually wizened, and is spouting off cliches like a history whale.",1160438400,,397,5.03030303030303
2589426,4,B000FUF7GM,"Yes, they glossed over the circumstances of John's death but this DVD does a fantastic job of detailing the life and talent of arguably the best bass guitarist (not merely a bass 'player') to finger a fret board. As a long-time WHO fan and owner of all JE's solo work, I was amazed to learn so much I did not know about his talent. Pete Townshend, as always, finds a unique way to present his views and appreciation for John's work from his unique perspective sharing the stage and countless jams with ""Thunderfingers"".

The comments of his contemporaries, and those whom he influenced such as Chris Squire of Yes, were enlightening. The most revealing content, however, was provided by The Ox himself through a series of interviews at his home which appear to have occurred not too long before his death.

There is plenty of 'musical footage' as well including the isolated ""bass only"" video of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from the DVD version of ""The Kids are Alright"". It's just the right mix of music, commentary on his talent and retrospective on his personality and his life to provide a complete picture of the man. He who stood so still and so quite for so long through so many WHO concerts, letting his fingers do the talking.

If there is one disappointment, and it is not minor, participation by his other living bandmate, Roger Daltrey, would have been sorely welcomed. (It will no longer be ""too bloody loud"" Rog. I'm certain you will miss that).

This is very good stuff with excellent narration by Peter Frampton. No self-respecting WHO fan or aspiring bass guitarist should be without this DVD in their collection.",1159747200,,1627,4.738515901060071
2589427,5,B000FUF7GM,"This documentary on John Entwistle is paced and presented well,  exploring his early childhood, how he met up with the other members of The Who, and his subsequent career in and out of that band. There have been many documentaries about The Who, but this once benefits from film footage provided by Chris Stamp, the band's former co-manager. Stamp adds insightful commentary, as do Pete Townshend, Roger Glover, Billy Sheehan, Chris Squire, director Steve Luongo, and other friends, family and associates of the late and lamented Ox. The bassist's death is treated somewhat subtly, but it's made clearer that John's lifestyle undermined his health leading up to his death at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas the morning of The Who's planned tour opening gig there. Bonus sequences include home movies, an interview with Entwistle's son, plus hard-blasting concert footage featuring The John Entwistle Band. The JEB video material features Entwistle playing bass in full throttle mode, a real treat for bass fans.",1157587200,,1012,5.170731707317073
2589428,4,B000FUF7GM,"There are moments in An Ox's Tale that are magical.  The Pete Townshend interviews cover a lot of ground.  The musical dynamics of the Who are covered, but Townshend shares recollections of John's childhood.  A number of John's contemporaries discuss his musical contribution.  This alone makes An Ox's Tale worth seeing.  Some complaints; the narrative could be stronger as there are subjects brought up, but never examined.  There a also a few repetitive montages.  Beyond that, it is a warm and touching doc that doesn't hide the causes of John's death, but isn't ""tabloid.""

For me, the song by John Entwistle played at the end was the most affective.  It's an intimate song that stripes away his trademark irony.  It summed up the film and it sums up the man.",1156291200,,764,4.8076923076923075
