8324771,4,B0000CG8AO,"""Before you are anything you got to be a man first."" - Gorgeous Dre(American Pimp)

I was always intrigued with the man...Gorgeous Dre aka Andre Taylor. As a man of color, and a student of sociology I was amazed with Andre Taylor's eloquence and position as a former pimp. It is quite easy to get wrapped up in the media stereotypes of the pimp character through film, tv, music etc.

 Andre Taylor presented something different. Taylor presented conviction and congruency. Over the years I was curious as to ""where are they now"" relating to the pimps depicted in American Pimp by the Hughes Brothers.

I noticed Taylor had transitioned into life coaching and a street preacher(after his prison term). Several interviews and clips plugging Master of the Game are available on youtube(which gave me awareness of the follow up to American Pimp). I figured it would not be available since it was not found on the net or amazon at the time of my search. My curiosity was engaged by his comments towards male insecurity, which eventually became the opening of his documentary.

As of late...Master of the Game has become available for purchase and download at [...]

Now, the production quality is not like a Hollywood budget documentary. Be aware that this is Gorgeous Dre aka Andre Taylor after release from prison & roughly between 2002. This is a capsule of Taylor...then in 2002-2003. I am not sure if this was previously released;however, at this point the documentary is available for fans and the curious a like.

Also, fans should be aware that Taylor was transitioning into his goal of being an entertainer & entrepreneur. One may notice snips of his music and videos spliced in during the documentary. If you have followed Taylor this far-he is certainly a man of great changes during his journey.

Some of the highlights for me was Taylor's views towards the pimp game, and even several interviews from his wife and women of his past. A lot of insight from the females towards Andre Taylor's role as a man are the key reasons they were successful as prostitutes. Taylor was solid as an oak tree, and allowed them to flow like water.

Check out his interview with Bruce Bugzy back in 2002. Part 2 of the interview presents Taylor's thoughts on male insecurity and jealousy. Otherwise, one needs to grab the documentary and watch the first few minutes of his statement that opens the documentary.

Again, this is for his fans. I did realize that many of the clips have been put in pieces ( not in the fashion of a linear narrative) on youtube, and on his myspace page. BUT, the full documentary does his story justice-and gives one the complete picture-at least until 2002-2003.",1378771200,4,2683,4.775377969762419
