8027239,4,B0002EP6DU,"Very good film with a great team of actors and wonderfuil music. This is so called ""a film on the shelf"": the movies prohibited to be shown in theaters due to their content, style and/or opposition to the official views, when the films were sent to a storage to be placed on a shelf for uncertain amount of time. All of them were ""freed"" in Perestoika times. I read somewhere that the movie was found too light-minded for a film about the Civil War to be a serious historical drama (though there are some elements of this genre in ""The Intervention""), and at the same time it has too serious content to be a musical or comedy (there are some elements of these genres there too).",1280016000,,678,4.388888888888889
