I haven't seen it in so long that I can't remember a lot of the plot and, even if I had seen it lately, I'd be a total spoiler. I seem to have a problem with shutting my big mouth. Anyway, if you enjoyed The Hobbit and/or The Last Unicorn, I highly recommend this movie. It'd make a fine addition to any movie collection (I just wish they'd put it out on DVD).",1061510400,2,536,3.926605504587156
