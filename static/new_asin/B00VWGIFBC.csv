7113087,4,B00VWGIFBC,"This film is a is the story of Sarah, a woman who was abandoned by the father she loved as a child, and her search for a relationship as an adult. Happily involved with her friends and dating to find the ""perfect"" man, her hopes seem fulfilled when she meets Reece. Wealthy, handsome, and charming, he is the epitome of her romantic fantasies. Sarah is devastated when Reece abandons her too.
Already starting to go to church through the encouragement of her friend, Tricia, Sarah begins to lean more on God while recovering from her broken heart. When Reece reappears in her life, she must come to a decision. The elements of forgiveness and restoration play heavily into this film as Sarah learns the true meaning of love.

Really more of a ""chick flick"" type film in many ways, but it kept my attention and I thought it was a satisfying film. I prefer the more subtle way of telling the story with elements of faith being a natural progression and the journey that may not always be a smooth path. I thought it was a well done film that opened doors to others to learn to forgive.

I received The Father's Love by Word Films compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside the complimentary copy of the DVD.",1435708800,3,1305,4.52542372881356
7113088,3,B00VWGIFBC,"In this DOVE approved film Sarah is working hard to make her way in the Big Apple and is having a lot of fun doing so. Behind the big smile and fun loving attitude there is also pain: As a little girl she saw her Dad leave their home, never to come back and she is hurting still.
When she meets Reese and falls in love, she is so happy she does not see the warning signs that not all that glitters is gold.

The Father's Love is the story of a broken heart and finding a shoulder to lean on when things are getting tough, that of God.
I cannot say I enjoyed the movie as entertainment yet I found the forgiveness ending comforting. Finally the actors tried hard but Sarah's journey of self discovery of real love and dignity was far too long for me.

I give it 3 stars!

7113089,5,B00VWGIFBC,"Sometimes when we want love so badly, we are willing to take it in the most unlikely of places. Far too often in places we wouldn't recommend a friend to do it, but often times willing to accept less than for ourselves, just to have it.

As a young girl, Sarah struggled to find a way to fill the hurt in her own life when her father failed her and her mother in being loyal to his family. Now as she has grown she is looking for it in all kinds of places, from work, to partying in her free time with friends, and even dating multiple men at the same time, in a way to fill the void in her own life. Her father continues to write her letters, but she refuses to open a single one, banishing the letters to a growing pile, much like she feels he had done to her.

When just the right man shows up, Sarah believes she has finally found the right one. He offers her everything under the sun. Wonderfully romantic dates, gifts and words of love and affirmation, even offering to share a great apartment in New York with her. But soon afterwards the phone calls from Reese grow in distance, always having to work, always being called out of town to help his family, and soon Sarah discovers that the love Reese has for her isn't the same definition she has.

I received The Father's Love by Word Films compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside the complimentary copy of the DVD. The opinions contained here are strictly my own. This movie has a great message but due to the subject matter involved, I wouldn't recommend this for the entire family even though the Dove Foundation has offered a review. It truly shows us what unconditional love looks like and how we can achieve that through God and through His Word found in the Bible and not from any man. It shows the power of God's love and how it has the ability to heal wounds we would never imagine possible and just how wonderful forgiveness can truly be. Well worth 4.5 out of 5 stars for this reviewer.",1433289600,6,2057,4.323834196891192

8711449,1,B00VWGIFBC,"Too much display of the main character's body. Immodest dressing. Immorality, kissing, sex scenes (not portrayed, but hinted), way too much inappropriate touching. I can't find anything good to say about this movie, other than the plot had good points, and could have been good, if it was done in a more Christian and clean way. As it is, the plot is spoiled by a low-budget production, slow moving plot, and indecent behavior for a Christian film. I understand that the main character was not a Christian at first, but why so much emphasis on her clubbing, drinking, sex life, love life, and indecent displays of her body? Clean up this film, and totally re-do it, and it might actually be okay.",1475539200,2,696,4.713114754098361

8711455,4,B00VWGIFBC,The Father's Love tackles a very common issue - finding true love. Oftentimes we look for it in all the wrong places. We forget that we are worth waiting for and waiting for that person who will treat us as we were meant to be treated. Sarah is living in New York City and is enjoying life except that she wants to find love with a capital L. She thinks she finally has it when she meets Reece at a party. He becomes her whole world and she is happier than ever. Until she realizes that what she thought was love wasn't. It makes her look for the true source of love and finally come to terms with her past as well. Excellent movie. Well done.,1465171200,4,643,4.111111111111111
