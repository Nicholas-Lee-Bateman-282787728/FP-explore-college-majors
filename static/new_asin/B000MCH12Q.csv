8167785,1,B000MCH12Q,"Extremely poor quality DVD transfer, with a digital ""watermark"" in the lower-right hand corner of the screen for the entire film.  Indians and fans of Bollywood need to learn to demand more from distributors of classic Indian films such as this one.  Colors are inconsistent and the print used to make the DVD transfer is severely damaged.  No effort was made to restore the print before making the DVD.  As is it, this DVD is a rip-off.",1457568000,,437,4.636363636363637
