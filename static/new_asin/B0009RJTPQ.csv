8065553,5,B0009RJTPQ,"This is a very enjoyable DVD of a somewhat hard-to-find TV series. I believe there are only around 9 episodes of Brave Eagle in circulation, with four of them on this DVD. Hopefully, Oldies.com can lay their hands on the remaining four (""Witch Bear"" can be found in several western DVD sets).  The show itself is interesting as it is told from the viewpoint of the Native Americans rather than the White Man; a rarity for the era (and even now). All four episodes on this DVD are pretty clear and decent transfers, considering the rarity and age of the shows.",1461369600,4,559,4.534653465346534
8065554,4,B0009RJTPQ,"This DVD contains 4 episodes of the 1955-56 TV series ""Brave Eagle"", produced by Roy Rogers' Frontier Productions.  The shows look great, are complete, and easily 5-star material.  The only major problem is the use of a huge ""RR"" logo during the shows.  It's infuriating to spend good money on a DVD and then have to put up with this logo crap.  The only way I could enjoy watching was to cover up that part of the TV screen.  Be warned, all DVD's from the Rogers Museum have this logo.",1283990400,12,486,4.355555555555555
