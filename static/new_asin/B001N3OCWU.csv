It is fun and entertaining, and with the violent and intense programming available on TV, this is a laid back alternative, a little low budget but that is fine with me. I can just relax and have fun with it. If you like quirky shows that don't take themselves too seriously then this could be for you.",1267920000,9,374,4.208333333333333
3710303,2,B001N3OCWU,"Beware! This is not the show Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed that was running on The Learning Channel and Discovery a few years ago. I goofed and bought this disc, which dramatizes 3 stories per episode and challenges the audience to guess which one really happened and which ones are only Urban Myths. The trouble is if you're an Urban Legend enthusiast like me, you already are familiar with these stories and this show doesn't fill in the background on the legends like ""Mostly True Stories"" does. So you end up with some hokey dramatizations which would tip off even someone who has never heard the stories to which ones ""actually happened"". Hence, I can't recommend this DVD to anyone and now I need to try to sell the damn thing. BTW-I didn't buy it on Amazon. I wish I had since I could have saved some money.",1244592000,9,828,4.563758389261745

8323155,3,B001N3OCWU,"This is a fun afternoon watch of a TV series that talks about popular urban legends. Although the subject matter is entertaining; the presentation of the legends could have been done a little better due to the ""2 false - 1 real"" format. Although the actors in the re-enactments do an admirable job of presenting the legends, they also (in some ways) give away the mystery of what legends are true and what are not. If you see an interview with an actor from a previous episode - you know it's going to be false. Also some legends are briefly touched upon on their history or origin while others are explained in detail with (who would of guessed it) actual live footage which immediately tells the viewer it's a real legend or based on real events. I really would have liked it if the show just presented the legends as is without the need of telling the viewer which ones were based on actual events and which ones were totally fabricated. A series based on Urban legends produced in the 90's did it this way and (in my opinion) really flowed better.

None the less I enjoyed it for what it was and wish more shows would focus on such subject matter. There are a lot of ""modern"" urban legends now-a-days thanks to faster internet and online social media; it would be nice if these were brought into the spotlight.

Keep in mind Amazon actually has the 3rd season of this series but it was produced/directed by Steven Scott and not Luke Campbell.

8323159,3,B001N3OCWU,"Fairly entertaining series in which each episode recreated three urban legends, then gives the viewer the chance to find out which one of the three is real (generally its pretty obvious, with slightly sillier fake episodes - or if you've read books of urban legends, you can discern the fake ones.) The production value is decent but at times is a little goofy (such as the guy in the chair with the weather balloons, etc).

The content is a tad mature for young viewers, as themes do include violence, cruelty to animals (no animals harmed in the making of course) and adult themes, with blurred nudity, etc, so probably not appropriate for all ages.",1444348800,4,651,4.7105263157894735

8323161,5,B001N3OCWU,"For those interested, this is not the series ""Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed"" from TLC. This is a series that aired originally on SyFy and is now seen occasionally on the Chiller Channel. The episodes are 30 minutes long and each episode contains three stories that re-enact popular legends or real events, complete with ""commentary"" from individuals involved. After the three segments are shown, you are to guess which of the three segments is true. In later series, there are times where more than one story is true. In the cases of the legends, the ""commentary"" is fake and done by actors, but in the real stories, the actual people involved provide the commentary. While I like this less than MTS:URL, I find this to be quite refreshing and nice.

Admittedly, the series was not something I immediately fell in love with, because many of the stories I could tell due to reading them or watching on MTS. However, there were quite a few that I had not heard of before, both real and false. Once I saw an episode with this, I basically turned 180 and became a fan. Yeah, some of the segments are cheesy, but I feel it gives off a better vibe with it. It's like a B-movie horror flick in that it's meant to give you satisfaction while not completely terrifying you.

There is just one thing I have to say though. The Blocky format of the title text on the purple and black cityscape background is creepy. The first time I saw it, it scared me. I once fell asleep watching this at night, and woke up to the main menu with the eerie theme playing around 3 in the morning. Suffice to say, I did not fall back asleep that night. Nonetheless, it's a great series worth watching, whether you've seen MTS or not.",1423353600,,1718,4.503205128205129
