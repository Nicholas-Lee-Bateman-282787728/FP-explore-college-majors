7856273,4,6303947085,"A visionary, dark, erotic and disturbing tale that is definitely filled with ""Illusions."" Heather Locklear does a fabulous job of portraying a former mental patient, Jan, who is released after her nightmares and hallucinations that got her put away, come to a sudden stop. Jan's husband Greg (Robert Carradine) has just purchased a new house in the mountains, so the happily married couple moves there. However, Jan's happiness is spoiled when Greg's sister, Laura (Emma Samms) comes for a visit. Jan's nightmares and hallucinations begin once again as she realizes that Laura and Greg might have a rather different brother-sister relationship than most, and that Laura is trying to drive Jan insane. Overall, ""Illusions"" is a highly original, intense drama that is similar to a character study, as we see the emotional ups-and-downs of Jan. The narration by Jan may sometimes be distracting and slightly annoying, but it does help to fill some plot holes not fixed by the scripted dialogue. All the performances are excellent, most notably by Locklear and Samms.
The script by Peter Colley (who adapted from his stageplay ""I'll be Back before Midnight"" to make this film) is extremely thrilling, sexy and full of intense situations. Director Victor Kulle makes this, as already stated, a visonary experience, making the entire film look like a dream. I bought ""Illusions"" from a local video store, having seen the reviews and cases for it on the internet. It's surprisingly a very good movie, considering the low budget it was on.",1071360000,,1531,5.103585657370518
