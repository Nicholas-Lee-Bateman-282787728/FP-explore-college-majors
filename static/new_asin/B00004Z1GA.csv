7927961,5,B00004Z1GA,"For a film from 1986, this one although obviously phones are different, isn't really that dated overall, well except that some of these types of weapons were banned after the Port Arthur Massacre ten years after the film was released. A hot girl runs a farm which is a wildlife sanctuary for native Australian animals that happen upon the place.  But some Mad Max style hooligans into blowing away kangaroos and bush bashing in their massive 4WD they affectionately refer to as ""The Beast"", aren't going to let No Hunting signs deter them.  In ""The Beast"" and a refrigerated truck with a Jaws rip off image on the back they harass a young blonde woman who drives from the property on her way to town.  At the town's main store, the woman behind the counter stupidly lets it slip that her friend Jessica is all alone on the farm when one of them is also in her store.  When she reacts outside the store to the really creepy one taking a photo underneath her (she doesn't like to wear pants)  and humiliates him, they decide to visit the farm and have some fun with her.  She however fights back, and in their minds this means they've got take it to an all new level.

It's a pretty fun film, although both the bad guys and Jessica seem unable to commit to doing what both's goals are in relation to each other, causing a repeat back and forth game with escalating terror for Jessica.  They could easily kill her at times when that seems the goal or do other stuff to her.  Yet they don't.  She could easily disable ""The Beast"" at one point, but leaves it for them to use when it's already been part of a nightmare experience for her.  You'd also think loud welding and banging sounds would wake these guys up about half way through the film.  Still the film is a fun one and a good look at rural Australian life in the 80's.",1518739200,,1823,4.3609467455621305
7927962,5,B00004Z1GA,"Are you a hetero male?  Are you sick (and disgusted) by the current crop of movies being shoved in your face by the feminist / anti-hetero / pro-homo hollywood elites?  (The ones depicting women acting like men, or men acting like girlies.)  If so, buy this movie!  This movie is about a very attractive woman who overcomes great adversity - but the storyline (and visual scenery) is intended for that 99% of the male audience (who enjoy watching the scantily clad female body).

Plotwise, poachers terrorize a woman, then there's an unforgettable scene of the woman *SPOILER* tied to the hood of a car *END SPOILER*, but the woman gets her revenge.",1423958400,3,649,4.758928571428571

7927964,3,B00004Z1GA,"I paid $30 for this in good condition with the exception of a badly abused case that needed to be replaced. I saw it as a kid, and remembered that I liked it, maybe because it was one of my first looks at naked female breasts in a movie. Unfortunately, seeing Delaney tied topless to the villains' vehicle is still the high point (no pun intended) of this movie. I don't usually pay so much for one title, and this one isn't worth it unless, like me, you want to see it one more time before you can't buy it anymore. The availability of this movie seems to be decreasing rapidly, and the price going up. If you want it for old-time's sake, better get it now.",1391904000,,658,4.188976377952756
7927965,5,B00004Z1GA,"This was like an old made for tv rape exploitation film from the 80's. I saw it when I was a child, but in my mind I was sure the girl got raped by all of those men on the hood of that truck in the film, but watching the movie again, it was skipped completely when making the film, I guess so it could appeal more to tv viewers. Personally, someone needs to remake this film with lots more nudity and sexual violence or insert hardcore rape scenes into the film making it NC-17. The way it currently is, it pushes no boundaries and could easily be mistaken for an ""after school special"".",1384992000,,587,4.157894736842105

7927968,5,B00004Z1GA,"If you enjoy Australian, action-packed movies as i do then this one is for you. Cassandra Delaney stars as what you might consider a helpless woman alone in the outback, but wait till you see how she deals with her terrorist. A great addition to any action packed movie lover's library.",1335312000,2,286,4.627450980392157
7927969,4,B00004Z1GA,"As understood, this nice Australian thriller run from 114 to 92min, depending on particular politics-to-date acceptance of nudity and violence.

Hilariously, the latest Australian edition lasts 82min and is worth every cent of a few dollars paid for, leaving the 30min cut to the rest hundred-plus US dollars requested in Amazon.

By hidjabbing the most of actions, modern Australia's modesty pursuers expose a very essence of skilled, handsome kangaroo-hunters, which is absolute ignorance of others, tolerance for own urges only, no moral but mere animal instincts to fulfil any madness desired.

Satisfying paranoiac impulses rather than sexual needs differs this work from some similar Russ Meyer's opuses.

No commentary advertised exists de-facto in EXTRAS.",1265587200,,763,5.666666666666667
