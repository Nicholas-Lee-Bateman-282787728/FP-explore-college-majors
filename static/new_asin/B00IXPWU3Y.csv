8646168,5,B00IXPWU3Y,"Love this DVD - good variety, short sessions, very easy to follow - classic Shiva Rea style",1503964800,,91,4.411764705882353
8646169,5,B00IXPWU3Y,"I love this video and I love the matrix system. I can get a better meditation in doing it this way than by having to switch videos constantly. And there's two already created meditation lines. So there's that, too. I love Shiva. She's so relaxing and her guided meditations are very helpful. My stress levels have dropped so much since I've found her and my back issues have drastically improved since I started doing this, too. Of course, that's also probably because this is helping to improve my posture. 5 stars all the way.",1497744000,,528,4.627659574468085
8646170,4,B00IXPWU3Y,I have most of shiva rea's videos. I love her. love her style. I was excited about this one because I want to meditate more and do well if I'm guided but I was a little disappointed that its a matrix (her handy format) of all the meditations from off of her other videos :( with a few others thrown in that ive never seen before. I was hoping for a selection of guided meditations longer than 5 minutes.....,1460246400,3,407,4.1645569620253164
8646171,3,B00IXPWU3Y,"I should have done more research on this. It's quite a bit of moving meditation. If you're into that, this is the DVD for you. Unfortunately, just previewing this, I felt like this was a bit too woo woo for me.",1451952000,4,210,4.146341463414634
8646172,3,B00IXPWU3Y,"I did like this video, lots of good meditations, but some were a little off-putting.  The Female meditation in particular.  It was a tad uncomfortable having to stare at Shiva Rea's camel toe while being instructed to touch myself all over in order to get in touch with my femininity.",1436832000,5,284,4.66
8646173,3,B00IXPWU3Y,Not exactly what I thought but okay,1426377600,,35,4.142857142857143
8646174,1,B00IXPWU3Y,Terrible.  The first DVD I ever threw in the trash.,1425427200,,51,4.1
8646175,4,B00IXPWU3Y,"This DVD is a compilation of meditations from several of her other DVDs (Trance Dance, Yogini, Radiant Heart, The Daily Energy series, and Yoga in Greece)  with a bonus 22 min creative flow meditation. Shiva has a calm and soothing voice, the music is relaxing and the scenery is gorgeous. I personally like the option of using the matrix to combine her movement meditations (there are several to choose from) with savasana and use it as the wind down at the end of my practice.

The Disc has:
3 solar meditations
3 lunar meditations
2 opening meditations (great for the start of your practice)
4 movement meditations and 1 pranic mediation  which is a combination movement/savasana prep
One nine minute chanting sequence
One six minute mudra meditation
The 5 min savasana from Yoga Trance Dance

I gave it a four because at the beginning of the disk is an annoying string of ads for other acacia products that can not be skipped. This really messes with my vibe when  I have to sit and wait for it to play through. My solution is to prep the DVD before I start, but if the solar portion of my practice comes from a different DVD, I waste four minutes with stupid techno waiting for it to finish.

All in all a good buy",1408665600,20,1219,4.493212669683258
8646176,5,B00IXPWU3Y,"This a compilation of her previous DVDs but she is great at instructing,the visuals on this product makes it worth to get them. You can play with the selections  and practice according to your needs.",1408579200,8,199,4.685714285714286
