8494758,4,B00247THE2,"When I ordered this item I had thought I was getting a documentary on specific NATO ships
but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it focuses on on the maritime strategy and
tactics of the Western navies preparing to fight the Soviet era navy. It presents different
scenarios of the overall strategy/plan of fighting the Soviets in the Atlantic. The dvd
includes footage of Soviet Cold War era ships and some live fire test footage of cruise
missiles and other weapons. Unfortunately, a lot of the Soviet navy footage tends to be older
and grainy. While the footage of the NATO navies is mostly of 1980s to early 1990s vintage and
most of it is of good quality.

The dvd is 37 minutes long and has 10 chapters. The chapters are:
1. Introduction: World War III, 2. Helicopters and Carriers, 3. The Submarines, 4. Ready for
Battle: The Hunter Killers (submarines), 5. Battle Beneath the Ice(attack boats in the arctic),
6. Know Your Enemy, 7. Defend and Protect, 8. The Support Role (escorts warships), 9. Conflict
at Sea, 10. Missile Attack (cruise missiles).

There is a small amount of footage dealing with the what the land conflict would be like but
it retains its focus on the possible conflict in the Atlantic. The programs does NOT give any
details about specific NATO ships but instead shows what their role would be within the context
of NATO's maritime strategy. For instance what the attack subs would do if war broke out between
East and West. It even goes into amphibious landings in Norway as a strategy of countering
possible Soviet gains in that country. The dvd comes with a book that provides more detailed
information about the warships that would do the fighting and also the challenges and strategy
of NATO at sea.

I liked this product because it deals with modern naval combat strategy and tactics during the
Cold War era. So the content and footage is dated to about late 1980s to early 1990s. If you
don't mind watching the dated footage then this informative documentary on modern NATO strategy
should be a good one to have. This product probably does appeal more to the naval enthusiast or
the person looking for some general information on warship tactics and strategy. But it does not
have the latest footage or content detailing the latest technology. I plan to keep it for my collection
because most military documentaries tend to focus on weapons and technology. This one focuses on
tactics and maritime strategy!",1372464000,,2451,4.775943396226415
