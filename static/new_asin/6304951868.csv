7880806,1,6304951868,"In this video, Hoagland shows us a single low resolution image that he claims shows a massive ""face"" on Mars.  To support his theory, he attempts to discredit any information that contradicts this theory, which necessarily involves accusing NASA and the government at large of a massive conspiracy to hide the truth from him and the public.
Able to leap enormous gaps of logic with a single phrase, Hoagland then presents some curious mathematics that ""prove"" that the ""The Monuments of Mars"" (yes, there are more than one) are linked to terrestrial crop circles, Stonehenge, and ancient Mayan temples.  The crowning glory is when Hoagland shows video taken from the Space Shuttle that he claims shows the US government firing upon a UFO, but strangely doesn't attempt to link this to the ""face"" -- leaving the impression that he's more interested in implying ""Conspiracy!"" than doing an objective scientific analysis.
Hoagland violates a basic principle of the scientific method by first forming a conclusion and then attempting to characterize all evidence in terms of how well it supports this theory.  As a pitch for an ""X Files"" episode it's mildly entertaining, but as a hard-hitting scientific theory it's a complete joke.",1005264000,2,1229,5.104477611940299
7880807,5,6304951868,"Hoagland has done a great service to us all by revealing the controvercial content of his years of research. For those who have wondered, who seek  truth and conspiracy, Hoaglandis a godsend. I found his intellect and  dedication quite moving, and convincing-- and am forever changed by the  evidence presented. At last, the extra-terrestrial phenomena has been  logically approached.",966729600,6,384,5.4576271186440675
