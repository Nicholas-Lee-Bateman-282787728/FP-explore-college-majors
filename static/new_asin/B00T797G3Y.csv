7002727,4,B00T797G3Y,Great show!  The only downside is that this DVD does NOT play in all DVD players.,1427328000,4,81,4.0625

7002768,5,B00T797G3Y,"They just get funnier and funnier. I had to buy all of the Squidbillies DVDs because they're that freakin' hilarious. Each and every episode of the Squidbillies from season 1 to season 6, are positively gut busting. None stop laughs and positive insane humor. I hilly recommend this DVD and all the others, if you're an animation collector like me. You will NOT be disappointed. Adult animation comedy at its absolute best. Totally hilarious. There are many times I have to rewind the episode I'm watching to hear what the characters said because I was too busy falling on the floor and laughing form the last joke and unable to hear what they said next. Its that funny. Insane comedy.",1450656000,,685,4.716666666666667
7002769,4,B00T797G3Y,"I'm going to review this new Squidbillies release and leave some information that wasn't listed in the description. Well, this isn't as much a review as just giving that information. I am pretty happy with this new volume of this completely bonkers show, though.

Like others, I am a tad disappointed with how this new volume was released. If it's either this or no volume 6 release, well, I'm happy enough just to have and own this season on DVD. But, it really is bare bones in my opinion in terms of no great cover artwork on the disc itself and no liner insert with something cool on it like normal. And while this DVD did play just fine in two of the Blu-ray players that I popped it into. Well, there is a light ""ticking"" noise that I heard continuously while I was watching this on-demand, DVD-R disc last night. As long as it plays and I can watch the episodes, I'm pretty much fine with anything and I should say that I think that this is another hilarious and insane season of the show. So, while I don't think I can give it the five stars that it would normally deserve like with previous, Squidbillies, releases. I still can say that overall I'm pretty happy with this DVD and again, I'm just glad and grateful that it was offered at all. Below is the episode list.

Now, I am sure this is the full season but I believe it also has extra episodes, at least it might. Because, unlike the recent releases, instead of just 10 episodes you get 15 on this disc. Which isn't the wonderful 20 episodes that we got on volume 1 and 2 of Squidbillies, but I am glad it's not just the 10 that we have received on the past few volumes. The episodes on this volume are,

01. Rusty and Tammi sitting in a Tree, B-A-S-T-A-R-D
02. Beware the Butt-Cutter
03. Squidbilly Manfishing
04. Green and Sober
05. The Legend of Kid Squid
06. From Russia with Stud
07. Granite Caverns
08. Ga-Ga-Ghost
09. The Inkubator Lives!
10. Drone to the Bone
11. A Jailhouse Divided
12. Stop, Jammertime!
13. Thou Shale Not Drill
14. The Squid Stays in the Picture
15. Gun of a Son

I didn't have the time when I did this to list any extras if there are any, sorry. But, I do hope that this review and information is helpful to any other shoppers and Squidbillies fans, thanks. Oh, and I also uploaded a flat cover image for this volume because the only one listed for this DVD is skewed and if you're like me and catalog your movies/television shows. You probably want a normal photo for the cover artwork. Again, hope this review and info. was helpful.",1449878400,8,2528,4.360934182590234
7002770,5,B00T797G3Y,"Well if you like twisted animation like ATHF, SeaLab 2021, and  Harvey Birdman, then this is the show for you. Its redneck fun and politically Incorrect and I love ever minute of it. From Adult Swim comes the story of well Redneck Squids. They steal lie cheat and generally cause mayhem. Role models they certainly are not. But if your looking for a twisted show with no real values whose moral compass always points south then Squidbillies is the show for you. Its so wrong its right. Its so stupid its funny. If your looking to have a laugh and you just don't care about being PC, then shut up, grab a cold one prop your feet up sit right back and watch this ridiculous show.",1447286400,,677,4.373015873015873

7002773,2,B00T797G3Y,"Great show, full of the usual insanity that is Squidbillies.  However, having waited for a while for this collection to be released I was very disappointed to learn that it does not work on all DVD players.  My copy played fine for about the first three episodes, then broke down, pixelated images and froze altogether if it went beyond that point.  I would give it five stars if I could, but the bad format ruined the experience.",1442534400,2,430,4.558441558441558

7002783,5,B00T797G3Y,"Great Episodes. Be sure to note that this DVD-R will not play in older DVD players that only play regular DVDs such as normal retail DVDs. It will play in most computers and newer DVD players. The outside art is as pictured, but there is no insert or picture on the disc itself. The disc is black with wording, and looks nice, but previous Squid DVDs had artwork on the DVD itself.
No stars off because I chose this option to save time and money. The Squid episodes...great as always.",1427673600,,484,4.388888888888889
7002784,4,B00T797G3Y,"I'm a huge Squidbillies fan. I have all of the DVD volumes so far, and now have this latest one, volume 6. I'm enjoying it, but there is an obvious downgrade in the packaging and disc format. Totally bare-bones, compared to the first 3 volumes. There are no extras, not even any music that plays in menu mode. No cool extra artwork that shows up when the disc is done playing. I'll always be a huge fan, but it seems like the over-all quality is declining.",1427673600,8,456,4.313953488372093
