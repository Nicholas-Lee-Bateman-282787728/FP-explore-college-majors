The characters have excellent roles, this has a six-star plot, and the action was filmed and thought of wonderfully.  I recommend you see this.",1007942400,,294,4.3090909090909095

799005,5,6304132360,"Clever, witty, beautifully done. Star Trek the way it was meant to be. The war/action episode were serious, the enigma type episode were just that, and the comedy episodes were sublime. The ""His Way"" episode was one of the funnest things I have ever seen, I laughed out loud. Here was a guy from 2400 taking love advise from a 1960's night club singer, who is really a hologram character. Yet the hologram knows that he is a hologram, but he knows a lot about love and human relationships! Really funny and heart warming, things you would not expect in a Star Trek episode.",1485475200,,573,4.519230769230769

799009,5,6304132360,"Season 6 is my favorite season of DS9.  I have watched all the episodes of the original, Next Generation, DS9 and Voyager many times using Amazon Prime.  That's approx 600 episodes.

Season 6 has the Federation retaking DS9.  Sisko really grows as the Emissary and his son Jake becomes a writer.  Worf and Dax get hitched.  The relationship between Odo and Major Hottie blossoms.  The introduction of Vic Fontane is pure genius.

My 2 episode I like best is ""His Way"" and ""The Sound of her Voice""  I don't want to elaborate too much, but I will say you will enjoy them too",1485129600,,572,4.475728155339806

799165,5,6304132360,This series is even better upon a second (or more) look. Especially binge watched in order.

799293,5,6304132360,"Best show even for family watching.  My 8y-old learned so much of astronomy and other science from this show because whenever they use scientific stuff in the plot (needless to say its SCIENCE fiction! ;0) I would discuss it with him, pointing to what is actually true in the real world and what is a scientific anticipation of not yet known/proven theories in Science.  Also refreshing to see (in our divided politicized real world) how science works together with different cultural beliefs without rejecting one another but trying to understand one another. Over all I think its great show to watch with good moral points to discuss almost after every episode! I also love plenty of good humor and standing up against evil stories in here - good for kids! Overall I watched it 3 times - start to end with my growing up kids (5 kids, they range from 28 to 8!), and every time I watch I find new nuances I missed in previous watching.

799377,5,6304132360,"My 14 year old son & I have been watching all the ""newer"" Star Trek series since we were gifted an Amazon Prime membership for Christmas last year.  Now in November, we're through all seasons of Next Generation and Voyager, and now we're almost through season six of Deep Space Nine.  Deep Space Nine starts out slow, but by Season 6, it's probably my favorite Star Trek series so far (as I rewatch it again years after it originally aired.)  They just don't make TV like this anymore!  The issues addressed in Star Trek are as relevant today as they were when these series originally aired.  Even the special effects and makeup really don't seem outdated because they were so well done for their time.  I have thoroughly enjoyed sharing these shows with my son.  It's been a great bonding experience and an opportunity to speak about some important issues that come up in the show that still apply to this day.

It's an episode of how the Romulans joined the Federation against the Dominion because of some craftiness & duplicity conceived by Garak, of course!

In fact over the last many months I have been slowly working my way through the seasons on Fire TV.

Today I watched episode 23 of season 6. Decide to get started with 24 and pick up the bulk of it later.....BUT

Suddenly ...on my screen anyway.....it required a Hulu Plus subscription.

Called support. Tried a few things...no dice and then something of a double talk explanation that contractual obligations made for sudden changes etcetera

I'm hoping it is a system glitch...will give it time.

In the meantime I checked and Voyager was the also requiring Hulu.....and another series I enjoyed revisiting. X Files appears to be completely gone. Also a movie they had rent before and I had planned to watch was suddenly gone too.

Fingers crossed it is a systemic glitch....might be because on my system text search is also not available right now.....voice search says each of those shows are not listed in catalogue...

PS The next day .It was a glitch. The Hulu requirement for DS9 and Voyager vanished. X Files reappeared, but does now require HULU.",1468886400,,1091,4.735449735449736

But overall good, engaging plots.  Sometimes, I will admit it didn't feel like a star trek series, because it's on a stationary station, and lots of the characters aren't federation officers.  But, thank goodness unlike TNG they don't sloppily hammer the point/moral lesson home in every episode.  Often they leave it open enough for you to decide what was right and wrong.  I thought that the Bajoran religion and emissary parts were going to get old fast, but they surprised me kept them believable and did not overdo it.  The Dominion war and Bajoran/Cardassian conflict also gave a good continuous plot line other plot lines could revolve around.  Summery: You want a series that will keep you interested and sometimes surprise you, try this.  And remember always give a show a half a season or sometimes a whole season before you quit on it.",1467417600,,1162,4.813131313131313

800082,5,6304132360,"As of this writing I'm the 434th person to make a review of this season. I won't go into all the details of this season. I'll do that when I have time to expand and edit this review. Suffice it to say that this was one of the best seasons of Star Trek Deep Space Nine's run. It had action, adventure, comedy, romance and unfortunately, the death of a long time favorite character just like Star Trek: The Next Generation. But unlike in The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine's character died near the end of the series' run. We cared so much more for Dax because we knew her so well. Yar was new to us and her character was never really developed too well.

The special effects on this series were incredible. The fx shots that they had were leaps and bounds ahead of where they were in 1988 just 10 years after TNG. I highly recommend this series. buy it before it is out of print. I wish they had been able to make one cinematic movie for DS9. The show deserved that in my opinion.

One more thing. Quark truly needs a bouncer in his bar!

Within that plotline, and sometimes completely unrelated, there are standalone episodes worth taking the time to watch.  It's important to note that while many people feel the series took a very dark turn with the war, some of these standalone episodes function as a break from that strain.  During the course of the season the viewer can see the effect the war has on the characters, so an occasional diversion is welcome.  Some are even delightful comic relief.

That would explain the speed with which the Romulans change sides.  But still one of the best.

I think this was a mistake and they should have operated like the previous Star Trek's and mad the show stand alone. That said they would insert some stand alone episodes in this which would be of little import. They would do this when they were losing the war, or the outcome was in question. This doesn't make sense, I can see a small diversion such as a game or a nice meal, but they would make there's all consuming. Too me this came off as dumb. Too many changes too the different species were also made, they did this in generations with the Klingons but not near to the extant as they do in Deep Space Nine. A lot of humans could fight hand to hand with Klingons in Generations, including Picard. All humans in the original series could fight with Klingons. In Deep Space Nine in the 5th or 6th season they make the Klingons 3 times the strength of humans, probably so they could have them fight the Jem'hadar. To me this is just sloppy writing, they should not change species as you go. If they wanted something else they could create new species, or better come up with a different show. this would be creative and not sloppy.",1438300800,,1215,4.310043668122271

801611,5,6304132360,"  

Season 6 is pretty much all about he war with The Dominion. Even in the episodes that don't focus on the war, the war is an ever present background plot. This dedication to the Dominion war over multiple seasons is what sets DS9 apart from the rest of the Trek series. It's what makes it good.

There are some breaks to the Dominion storyline that are more 'fun' episodes in Season 6. The alternate universe where all the Trek characters are evil comes back in this season. And there is an episode where some of the crew is on a shuttle that's shrunk to a few inches long. It's kind of a silly story line, but it works and is a welcome break from the heavier story arc about the Dominion war.

As for the storytelling DS9 is probably the best overall story arc in the Trek franchise. While there are a lot of single episode stories, there is an overall story arc that spans the entire series. It's interesting. It's well written. Well made. And it's just good sci-fi and story telling in general. The series long story arc takes a lot of twists and turns but it deals with inter stellar politics and power struggles that the other Trek series only elude to. (Yeah, Captain Picard has a fair amount of diplomatic and military run ins with the Romulans and Klingons, but on Deep Space Nine the series delves much deeper into the politics or all that, and introduces a few new races from the other side of the galaxy into the mix)

If you like the Star Trek franchise, you have to try Deep Space Nine.",1430611200,,1502,4.362007168458781

801765,5,6304132360,"Okay, my review of Season 5 wasn't so loving.  Season 6, however, seemed much better.  To me, Star Trek shouldn't always be ""warm and fuzzy"" like some of the previous seasons were.  Dark, odd, worrisome, now THAT's entertainment!

Star Trek: Deep Space 9's Season 6 had shaken the tree, so to speak with Terry Farrell's (LT/LCDR Jadzia Dax) farewell.  Some may think that was an odd ploy, but it works.  Hey, if people aren't happy with what they're doing and where they work, they definitely aren't going to turn in excellent performances.  It was win-win.  Farrell wanted to leave and DS9 got to use that to their benefit.

As always, the usual cast of the station kept themselves busy with the minutiae of daily life aboard a revolving ""hotel"" at the mouth of a wormhole.  With all the extra characters that manage to float in and out, it was easy for the writers to continue writing great scripts and for Michael Westmore to have some cool characters.",1424304000,,955,4.664670658682635

Most of it's airtime conveniently overlaps with Voyager; and so now that these series have been gone for some time now, it is now time for Paramount to assemble the team once again and see these captains acting together -perhaps with a little Borg ingenuity at her disposal, Admiral Janeway from Voyager can now use seven of nine and some of her crew to team up with Bajor to find the captain. Of course, such an epic adventure can not unravel without a mind-blowing plot that reveals a catastrophic conflict. Perhaps the Borg from another time frame capture seven and force her to collaborate in reaching a comprehensive understanding of Omega. Omega will be the final factor that could pull the alpha, delta, and gamma quadrant into a war with the Borg from a past time frame. Eager to reclaim their title as rulers of the universe, the Dominion, the Federation, and allies that Janeway had made in the Delta quadrant come together to destroy Omega and the Borg indefinitely? Will the Borg have retained some of the knowledge after having assimilated temporarily Jean Luc Picard? Will they also have the upper hand because they have the only Borg from the current time frame at their disposal? how much will Janeway risk and will the prophets release captain Sisko in an effort to help the federation eliminate the threat?

I look forward to reading anyones' written responses... who has suggestions? Who tends to agree?

Paramount...it is time to return to the drawing board...new characters and new ships. We need new alliances and new alien enemies. What new tactical advantages will the Federation have to their advantage?

Look at Deep Space 9 in all seasons and understand how this franchise comes together. Be prepared to be amazed.",1408752000,,1941,4.875757575757576

Sisko loses his wife during an attack on a space ship and while still grieving he and his 11 year old son are assigned to a deep space station that was formerly occupied by the Cardasian race captors of the enslaved Begorian people.
When he arrives the Begorians who worship a non-corporeal alien race announce that Sisko is The Emissary that ancient text foretold would deliver their race. Each episode is woven with political intrigue, from the Begorian religious leaders who resent an outsider being their emissary and military intrigue from the Marque a rogue group of foreign settlers on Begor who resent interference from Starfleet and are secretly waging war again the Cardassians. There is also comic relief from the Ferengi whosculture is characterized by an obsession with profit and their constant efforts to swindle unwary customers.
By the end of the first episode a stable worm hole is discovered just above Begor that will open the quadrant to new trade and what ever else awaits on the other side of the galaxy.

802525,5,6304132360,"I'm convinced DS9 is one of the best science fiction series ever to hit television and possibly the best of the Star Trek franchise--equal to Next Generation. The writing is tight, the plots are intricate and fascinating. Even the limitation of being stuck mostly on a space station (relieved by the Defiant ship) have been overcome. In fact, one of the best episodes ""In the Pale Moonlight"" is a tour de force. In this episode, Sisko literally risks not only his career but the fate of the entire Federation with a plan of deception, concocted with the aid of Garak the Cardassian agent. The episode is told as a monologue by Avery Brooks (as Capt. Sisko) entirely as a self-video personal log. This guy can ACT. The end is stunning, yet it simply takes place on a couch in Sisko's quarters. Another episode, Valiant, is almost a mini-film in itself, with a young crew of elite cadets who are field-brevet promoted to full officers after a devastating attack on their training mission.

The rest of the season has a good thread about the increasing losses during the Dominion War, with side trips for wartime love affairs (the whimsical holosuite character Vic Fontaine has an episode with Odo that is very sweet) and of course more Ferengi antics are shoved at us. DS9 manages the impossible, to make the craven Ferengi more palatable (Quark and Nog) but the episode where the Nagus is deposed in a coup was one I skipped past. I have a rule, more than three Ferengi in an episode, and I'm done.

Despite the diversions, the arc of the war story is strong, and the characters develop, though never quite as fully as on Next Generation. This is some of the best Trek I've ever watched. Avery Brooks should sing more, by the way.",1382400000,2,1729,4.628664495114006
802526,4,6304132360,DS9 develops its characters fully and believably over the 7 seasons.  Even the villains have depth.  Easily the best series in the franchise.,1380499200,,141,5.086956521739131

I would take a captured space station and a fleet of Defiant class ships over any of the other Star Trek chronicles.

There were some great episodes in season 6, I guess this is part of why I pay for Prime membership, so I can watch some of the classics of DS9.  There are a few episodes that really have some teeth.

802701,5,6304132360,"Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine, Season 6, is unquestionably the best Season of Deep Space Nine, and one of the best seasons of all of Star Trek, in my opinion.  This season has some of the best episodes in all of Deep Space Nine.  Waltz is a beautiful masterpiece, as an injured Sisko and a slowly turning insane Gul Dukat are stranded after crash landing on a planet.  Rocks and Shoals is a very deep episode that deals with morals and conscience, although this time, not of Starfleet, but with an injured Vorta running low on Ketracel White for his squad of Jem'Hadar.  Sacrifice of Angels is a very interesting episode, deeply dwelling on religion, namely Sisko as the Emissary as he attempts to give his life in a suicidal attempt to stop a Dominion armada from exiting the wormhole.  Far Beyond the Stars is epic, and later play into the Season 7 episode, Shadows and Symbols.  One Little Ship is a moderately cheesy premise but has a lot of fun in it, and I enjoy the fact that the Jem'Hadar were able to briefly occupy the Defiant.  Inquisition introduces us to Section 31, as Sloan tries to recruit Dr. Bashir into the organization.  In the Pale Moonlight is one of the darkest episodes of Deep Space Nine, having all ready happened, and Sisko narrating how he tricked the Romulans into the Dominion war, with the help of Garak.  His Way is sort of a ""let's forget there's a war going on"" episode, but it does bring Kira and Odo together, finally.  The Sound of Her Voice is a very strange, yet interesting episode, dealing with the echo of a woman's voice, now dead, as Sisko and company attempt to rescue her.  Tears of the Prophets was probably the second best season finale, only behind Call to Arms in Season 5.  This shows the dark side of war, that actions have consequences, and we lose Jadzia Dax :(  This season is beautiful, covers many aspects on all our characters, main and supporting alike, and is a true Trek gem.",1374451200,,1934,4.504297994269341
802702,5,6304132360,"Deep Space Nine(DS9) began as a mediocre shopping mall in the sky with characters and plots hardly up to the hopes of the Trekker community.  As a result, it never 'took off' as did the original show and Next Generation.  Even Voyager(my favorite but much maligned) had Seven-of-Nine while DS9 never had that 'water cooler' attention getter.

To set itself apart from the other Treks, the producers made the station chief hate Captain Piccard of Next Generation.  OK, they wanted to break away, but this further antagonized some viewers.  What next?

Ah, but the producers took another direction.  Adding Dominion War, the most interesting character in Trek(the tailor/assassin on board the station, a Cardassian double agent); Worf from Next Generation along with O'Brien too; Ferengi's for comedic relief; hyper-serious plots about the Holocaust, the military-industrial complex, etc etc.  By the time of the sixth season, the show had become mature, nuanced, and 1 million miles away from the shaky start.  People forgot how shaky the Next Generation was in its first year.  But, unlike any other Trek series, DS9 learned from its errors and just kept evolving and adding weight to its content.  By this, the sixth season, it was as good as any Star Trek-themed series.

One final note: This DVD is a pretty good print, but the sub-menu's are terrible, perhaps the worst I've seen since the Commodore 64.  If you enter them, be forewarned: my print did not illuminate the cursor selection properly and it was quite irritating after a while.

""A truly unique and dark version of the Star Trek franchise that sets it a part from all the other series. What I like best about this series is that it focuses more on the aliens and has a wide slection of interesting regulars who are NOT in starfleet. However it keeps the traditional Star Trek story telling style of making powerful and relevant commentary on the human condition but in a unique way. With the 3rd and 6th seasons being the best, after the less than stellar first 2 seasons.- enchantmentofeternity""

Instead, the story explores the possibility that DS9 is nothing more than the imagination of a writer in the 1960s. We follow his story as he tries to publish the station's story, pushing back against the racist adversity of the time.

I can understand that the episode might be a little too meta for some viewers, but for me, this abstraction was perfectly done. The episode has us watching the characters we love questioning their own status as characters, and reminds us that one of the greatest gifts that humans possess is the ability to imagine the future, to imagine a different world. Why else do we watch Star Trek in the first place? We embark on a journey to a world where a black man can command a space station. Hard to believe there was a time when you wouldn't have been allowed to imagine such a thing.

The first part of the episode, while not as big on overarching plot points, is an interesting window into Odo. Vic is one of the best holocharacters Trek ever did. Totally disagree with the idea that Kira/Odo is ""unrealistic"" -- sometimes unlikely romances actually happen. Kira is a woman who spent most of her formative years as an on-the-run terrorist so I think it's very believable that she is a person who never knew exactly what she wanted romantically.

Lots of laughs, especially coming off the recent Dominion war heavy episodes.

Okay so now I'm going to go on a bit of a rant. Jake Sisko; the character and the actor, makes me puke. I've tolerated him for 4.5 season, but just recently he's causing me nightmarish flashbacks to having to watch Wesley on Star Trek TNG. It began when he decided not pursue star fleet and become a writer. No one cares about your stupid books, or you're stupid news articles. When he decided to stay behind to report on the Dominion war instead of standing by his father. The way he almost exposed the resistance movement snooping around for his retarded Star Fleet news coverage and bragging about having ""sources"". And now in this episode gloating about his book being published....Hey Jake...STFU! Nobody cares! You've become a tremendous disappointment and Nag has more honor than you (who the hell would've thought). As a matter of fact Capt. Sisko would probably rather have Nag as a son than you, I puke everytime I see Jake trying to ""act"" on this show.

803231,5,6304132360,"In this season the war with the Dominion starts to heat up and there are some victories. The most noted one is the retaking of Deep Space Nine. And it was one that had to be acted on fast because the Dominion had figured out a way to disable the mine field (set up during Season Five). Now while much of the season was focused on the war there were other events as well. Major Kira and Odo start a relationship and things do get intense. Lt. Commander Worf and Jadzia Dax get married. A new character appears. That would be Vic Fontaine, a 1960's Las Vegas
night club singer. Vic Fontaine is a hologram and knows he's a hologram, but he is able to interact with the crew and he is able to sense when things are wrong and can step in to help or give advice. However the season does not have a pleasant ending. Jadzia Dax is attacked and killed, the prophets abandon Bajor, and Captain Sisko leaves Deep Space Nine on a leave of absence and it's not known if he'll return. He takes his baseball with him.

While all the episodes were good here are some that stand out:

* Who Mourns For Morn: A episode that is devoted to and tells a side about a beloved, secondary character: Morn

* In The Pale Moonlight: Captain Sisko lies, cheats, and even becomes an accessory to murder to help the war effort. And he is okay with doing that.

* Inquisition: Introduces Section 31. An outfit whose stated purpose is to safeguard the Federation at all costs-even if it violates Federation principles.

In the poem, Shelly hijacks the rationalist view that I'd have expected from Aeschylus (and Roddenberry) and gives it his own romantic spin: love conquers all.

803295,4,6304132360,"The 34th rule of Acquisition states that ""War is Good for Business,"" but War is GREAT for Deep Space 9. Knee deep into the war with the Dominion, DS9 goes where no other franchise has dared to go. The closest comparison is the Borg in Next Generation, however the Borg were entirely unsympathetic cyborg creatures who were the binary opposite of all other life forms in the Star Trek universe. That made the Borg war a black and white moral affair. However here in DS9 we have a war between similar life forms with radically different ideologies. The previous 5 years of character development for both sides of the war make for intensely detailed and rich drama. The conflict between Dukat and Sisko is riveting because of the dynamic relationship that has developed between the two leaders for years. DS9 is the only Star Trek that shows humanity in differing shades of grey. DS9 is not about a utopian future with perfect characters that have to seek drama and conflict outside of themselves, DS9 rejects syrupy platitudes and gets down and dirty in season 6.

""In the Pale Moonlight"" is an exquisite examination of morality in a time of war and is my favorite offering in Season 6. ""Favor the Bold,"" ""Sacrifice of Angels,"" ""Waltz,"" ""The Reckoning,"" ""Far Beyond the Stars,"" ""Inquisition,"" and ""Tears of the Prophets"" are the pick of the litter here.

The sequentially driven Dominion War arch episodes are top notch in season 6. That being said, this season also contains some of the worst stand alone episodes of the entire series. ""Sons and Daughters,"" ""Statistical Probabilities,"" ""Change of Heart,"" ""The Orphan,"" and ""The Valiant"" are weak offerings that dilute an otherwise excellent season.

The duds are compensated with a great convivial fare in ""Who Mourns for Morn,""  and ""The Magnificent Ferengi.""

The tension is building up in season 6 for the final season 7 ahead that leads to the best and fully realized ending of any show in television history.",1332288000,6,1963,4.865269461077844

Aside from his love of Lwaxana Troi and hatred of the mirror universe, I'm pretty much with him.

That said, you've gotta watch this one. The fact that it's separate from the Dominion plot is irrelevant. This is a great hour of television. It's a fantastic exploration of what science fiction means to culture, and it's the only time that Star Trek really engages with the issue of race.

803652,5,6304132360,"Bottom-Line: ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" with its 26 episode arc (unheard of today in this era a 13 episode seasons) is science fiction television at its best.

The Star Trek franchise has been alive for over forty-five years and through all of the various incarnations: Star Trek (The Original Series), Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek: Enterprise, as well as nine motion pictures, I have been an eager and loyal fan.

When ""Star Trek Deep Space Nine (ST: DS9)"" hit the airways in 1993 I was stationed with the U.S. Navy in Hawaii.  Because if my rather unpredictable schedule I was able to see only a few episodes, principally the first season, but overall I missed most of the 7-season run of ST: DS9.  So when I found all seven seasons of the series on Amazon.com, I plotted a course and picked up the entire (7) season run over the last two years.  I am just finished watching The Complete Sixth Season.

The Story-Line

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" is entrenched in Gene Roddenberry's now multifaceted Star Trek universe.  The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and indeed they produced most of the episodes.  Paramount Television owns the Star Trek franchise and released the series to DVD.

A spin-off of Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" opens as the war with The Dominion kicks off in a big way.  At the end of Season Five, the Federation loses control of the Cardassian space station Terok Nor (Federation name Deep Space 9) to a combined Cardassian/ Dominion force.

As ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" kicks off the Federation and the Klingon Empire are losing the war against The Dominion.  Major Kira (Nana Visitor ~ Dark Angel, Mini's First Time, Wildfire), Odo (Rene Auberjonois ~ Benson, The Pirates of Dark Water, The Patriot), Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton ~ Soul Food, Invasion)  and Quark (Armin Shimerman ~ Beauty and the Beast, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Boston Legal) live under Dominion-occupied Deep Space Nine and eventually start a resistance cell to limited effect.

Meanwhile Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks ~ Spenser For Hire, A Man Called Hawk, American History X) together with Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell ~ Paper Dolls, Deep Core, Becker) and Operations Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney ~ Last of the Mohicans, Star Trek The Next Generation, Clean Break) based on the U.S.S. Defiant devises a plan to take back Deep Space Nine.  And five episodes into the season in Favor The Bold, he succeeds, calling upon the ""Wormhole Aliens"" for help in keeping Dominion reinforcements from coming through the wormhole.

But the war with The Dominion is far from over, indeed ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" proves to be a very bloody and costly one indeed; the retaking of Deep Space Nine is only the beginning of what turns into a long protracted war in which the survival of the Federation is at stake. The war with the Dominion taints every episode of Season Six and takes the series to a very dark place that also sees Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn ~ Star Trek The Next Generation, CHiPs, Heros) and Jadzia Dax marry, only to have her character meet an unfortunate end during the closing episode.

There are also several recurring Cardassian characters in ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season, including the former head of the station Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo ~ Hill Street Blues, Star Trek: The Next Generation); he acts as the primary villain of the series.  Gul Dukat is a complex character and he undergoes several transformations before ultimately becoming profoundly evil and by the show's conclusion, he has morphed into Sisko's archenemy.

Another equally complex character is Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson ~ Ryan's Hope) the only Cardassian to stay on the station after his fellows pull out.  He is suspected of being an agent of the dreaded Obsidian Order, the Cardassian secret police however; he insists that he is but a humble tailor.

My Thoughts

ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season continues to build on the fine start of Season One insofar-as each story build on the other in some way shape or form.  And each episode is well written, well-acted, and this sixth season builds on the story-lines of the first five with intriguing and engaging story-lines and characters.

In the ST: DS9 universe a large cross-section of alien creatures comes through the station, in fact almost every episode introduces us to a new race, most of which come through the wormhole.

Though there are light moments in ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season most of the episode explore dark material that more than other Trek series explore contemporary issues in American society at the time, including the separation of Church and State, the role of religion in the classroom, genocide, racism, loyalty, bigotry, and terrorism and now all-out war with The Dominion.

Avery Brooks continues the evolution of Captain Benjamin Sisco in fine fashion.  His character, like so many before him called ""Captain"" in the Star Trek universe, is both strong, but also flawed, and essentially human.

There is little separation between Star Trek: The Next Generation and ST: DS9; both series take place during the same time period, only ST: DS9 had a bit more dark spice to offer up.  All of the actors on the series now completely inhabit their characters and work well together as an ensemble.  The caliber of actors, both regulars, and guest stars, is outstanding make the series and engaging, emotional, and sometimes tough to watch.

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" with its 26 episode arc (unheard of today in this era a 13 episode seasons) is science fiction television at its best.  The special effects are top notch, the stories well written, and episodes well-acted, and the overall plotline well received.  And while Season's 4 and 5 should be watch before this sixth season (context), ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Sixth Season"" stands out for me as the best season in the (7) season run of Star Trek Deep Space Nine.",1293753600,,6067,4.875365141187926
803653,5,6304132360,"If you enjoyed the DS9 Dominion War as much as I did then you will enjoy not only Season 5,but also Season's 6&7. These 3 seasons contain the whole stoty. Higly recommended for anyone.",1293321600,,184,4.4411764705882355
803654,5,6304132360,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 6 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first four seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

Season 6 is the next best Season with regards the consistency of good episodes to Season 3.  I liked ""Rock and Shoals"", the hilarious ""The Magnificent Ferengi"", ""Favor the Bold"", ""Sacrifice of Angels"", the brilliant ""Far Beyond the Stars"", ""Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night"", ""Inquisition"", ""In the Pale Moonlight"", ""The Reckoning"", ""Time's Orphan"", and the season ending episode ""Tears of the Prophets"" is very good too.  Overall I believe this season 6 together with season 3 to be the best among the seven with no real dud episodes to speak off.

The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 6 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

Highly recommended!",1293321600,,2254,4.813953488372093

803657,5,6304132360,"Despite a six episode long WWII melodrama-style story arc that in some parts is rather pompous and self important the sixth season of Deep Space Nine was a marked return to form for the series. Even though it all took place under the smoke of the always esculating Dominion war the content of the episodes of this season was more varied and the storylines broader in scope than anything the series had done for about a season and a half. First off,as promised in the finale of the previous season Jadzia Dax and Worf are wed in a tradition Klingon wedding after Jadzia must openly confront the differences between her free spirited nature and what's expected of her as a Klingon wife. Even though it is a dark episode ""Waltz"" is an absolutely eye catching study of Gul Dukat's intense dimentia,meglomania and evil as he confronts Sisko on his true opinions on the galaxy around him and reminds Sisko that there is an element of both great good and great evil around him. ""Far Beyond The Stars"" is one of the strongest and most unique DS9 episodes ever as Sisko has a religious experience with the Bajoran Prophets identifying him with a 1950's science fiction writer who is actually dreaming up Siski and the Deep Space Nine world and is driven to insanity by a world that refuses to except the concept of a story about a racially integrated crew of his space station. Given Avery Brooks.......unique approch on theatrical acting this episode gives him a chance to display his quircky sense of intensity. ""Wrongs Darker Than Deaht Or Night"" explores Kira interacting with her mother's questionable association with Dukat during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. This season is home to my very least favorite DS9 episode ""In The Pale Moonlight"". It's a very morally questionable episode wherin Siski lies and cheats to get the Romulans involved in the war against the Dominion and there's no solid emotional resolution in the end. Of course aside from that digression there is a very funny episode in ""Profit And Lace"" where Quark ingages in a little Ferengi style transvestism in order to finish an important job his ailing mother is unable to complete. ""Times Orphan"" is a complex family episode for the O'Briens who,on a trip to Bajor lose their daughter Molly back in time,only to have her emmerge as a maladjusted 18 year old who winds up returning her younger self back to her parents. The season ends on an unpleasant note when Jadzia Dax,popular series character whose personality mingling fire and compassion defined the general character of the series is killed in one of the most senseless and meaningless deaths in all of Star Trek. Even though the series had one more season to go things would never quite be the same.",1277683200,,2732,4.790254237288136

803659,5,6304132360,"As many have noted, Season Six of DS9 is clearly the most controversial.  Most of this is centered on the confusion surrounding the departure of Terry Ferrell from the show.  My belief is that studio was not willing to provide her with the kind of money she wanted in order to stay on the show rather than pursue the rather mediocre sitconm

The unquestioned highpoints of the season revolve around increasing developments in the war with the Dominion.  These ongoing plotlines are what make DS9 so much more involving than the other shows in the STAR TREK series.  There were a number of exceptionally good episodes and a number of outstanding Gul Dukat twists, as he continued to be one of the most interesting characters on the show.  Several of the standalone episodes were superb, such as the outstanding ""Far Beyond the Stars,"" in which Sisko has a vision of himself as a pulp SF writer in the 1950s, with all of the usual cast members appearing without make up.  Just as good is ""His Way,"" in which James Darren made his first appearance as holodeck lounge singer Vic Fontaine and helped Odo to loosen up and, as Sebastian the Crab would put it, to ""kiss the girl"" (coincidentally, in THE LITTLE MERMAID Rene Auberjonois did the voice of the chef who was intent upon making Sebastian part of the prince's dinner).  This season featured as many truly great individual episodes as any.

On the downside, the romances on the show were all appalling.  Both Dax and Worf on the one hand and Odo and Kira on the other were completely lacking in chemistry.  I never believed any of them as couples.  The brute fact is that STAR TREK had no memorable romances.  The best of the bunch was probably VOYAGER and even then only Tom and B'Elanna.  Most of the romances seem forced, like Worf and Deanna on TNG and the absurd pairing of Neelix and Kes on VOYAGER.  Or the almost random pairing of Seven of Nine and Chakotay, who had developed absolutely no history or nothing that would lead one to anticipate their getting together at the end of the series.  It is just not one something the show did very well.

I personally didn't mind the demise of Jadzia Dax.  I didn't dislike Terry Ferrell, but I wasn't an especial fan either.  I loved the concept of Dax, but that didn't go away in Season Seven with the appearance of Ezri Dax.  In fact, I loved the whole idea of Ezra, who was completely untrained to become a host to the Dax symbiote.  But this is all a matter of preference.  I fully understand those who found the departure of Terry Ferrell to be a minor tragedy (even if I don't share their sense of bereavement).

One thing to point out about the show is what a superb creative team they had.  Many of the producers and writers went on to bigger and better things.  Ren Echevarria, for instance, went on to be one of the main people tasked with carrying out James Cameron's ideas for DARK ANGEL and later headed up THE 4400 (along with Ira Steven Behr), before moving on to be Executive Producer on MEDIUM and CASTLE.  The writing team of Bradley Thompson and David Weddle wrote several very fine scripts for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  Peter Lauritson stayed with STAR TREK for a while longer, working on ENTERPRISE, before going onto THE STARTER WIFE and now THE MENTALIST.  Terri Potts after DS9 went on to work on two groundbreaking comedies, FREAKS AND GEEKS and UNDECLARED.  And of course, no one did better than Ronald D. Moore, who became show runner on ROSWELL before moving over to be show runner of CARNIVALE, before going on to reinvent TV SF with BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.

Still, whatever the faults of Season Six, and I will be frank in saying that I found fewer (except in the romantic relationships department) than most, the series remained as satisfying as ever.",1261008000,2,3780,4.598507462686567
803660,5,6304132360,"This season is, in my view, the apex of DS9. This is probably due to the fact that it's the last season with the original cast intact. Dax, a character I've personally loathed, finally wins you over in her final episodes. Terry Farrell really shines in the wedding episode, ""You Are Cordially Invited"", and shows that her evolution from 'annoyingly-cryptic wise man' to a spunky amazon was a decision which saved her character. No more walking around with her hands behind her back all the time, as if that makes her a more convincing 700-year-old. For awhile she reminded me of Dean Cain's Superman who always walked around with arms folded.

Basically, the whole cast is hitting all cylinders. Avery Brooks rocks the house in ""In the Pale Moonlight"", as everyone knows. Worf has continued to solidify his place in the DS9 pantheon most elegantly. This romance with Dax, while stilted at first - then again, you could say that of all of them - is the sweetest relationship on Trek. Alternatively, Odo's budding relationship with Kira is a bit wobbly; it seems Odo's infatuation was more interesting when they were kept apart. Once he and Kira are on-screen together, it's slightly inbred for these salty war buddies to lock lips on the crowded promenade.

The Dominion War (finally) heats up with some space battles; whole fleets of Federation ships, Klingon Birds of Prey, the whole kabob. The CG effects are surprisingly solid too, considering how much time has passed. They still look good. There's still a few clunkers in this season. The one where Quark gets a sex change (blargh) comes to mind. However, I almost welcome that episode since it finally killed off DS9's affinity for excessive Ferengi episodes.

Another flop is ""Wrongs Darker Than Day Or Night"", which begins with Sisko cavalierly granting Kira permission to futz around with the space-time continuum. Yeah, sure. The story doesn't work at all, nor does the revelation that Dukat kept Kira's mother as a concubine. Wait, just how long was Dukat the prefect of Bajor? Supposedly, he caught flak for being the last (failed) Cardassian to hold that post; yet here, he's ruling over the planet twenty years in the past. Anyway, the show would've worked better if a younger Dukat was merely *stationed* on Bajor in the past, instead of ruling over it.",1253318400,,2318,4.878172588832487
803661,3,6304132360,"This season began with an exciting deviation from the standard episodic format of Trek shows, and indeed from the accepted style of science fiction/action shows in general. The first half-dozen episodes are a basically continuous little arc which finds the station itself occupied by the Federation's enemies, and the cast split in half -- some of them depart the station to carry on the war with the fascist Dominion, while others remain on Deep Space Nine as a resistance against the occupation.

That makes the first few episodes exciting drama, but keep in mind that the Dominion War was never more than an efficient Second World War-style conflict in space, with little or no dramatic subtext or relevence, and the consequences of the war never quite reach our heroes. The Dominion themselves were static bad guys, obsessed with conquering the galaxy, and they never develop beyond that defining trait. This entire arc is ultimately disappointing, because it never goes quite as far as it could. The show's plodding style and dreary music certainly don't help amp up the suspense.

The following episodes of the season descend into DS9's usual mishmash of comedic Ferengi-centric buffoonery and generic sci-fi nonsense, with many holographic adventures and run-ins with various villains, and plenty of bland soap opera from the main cast. Worf and Jadzia Dax get married, which is a bad move for both of them; Odo and Kira fall in love, which was likewise ill-conceived; a holographic lounge singer listens to the crew's problems. The war is all but forgotten, and moves forwards from time to time in jarring fits and starts, such as the season finale which sees Jadzia murdered by the series' villain, and some setbacks for the rest of the cast. This all could have been built up much better, if the writers/producers had only bothered to plan out their show and invest it with some kind of structure.

A few good episodes arrive in the middle of the mess: in ""Far Beyond the Stars"" Captain Sisko has visions from the godlike Prophets that cast him in the role of a 1950's science fiction writer, and he experiences racism for the first time on Star Trek. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the ongoing story of the series, but it's a good hour of television anyway and it's fun to see the cast playing different roles without their alien make-up. It's a classic sort of Trek episode almost lost amid all the war and bustle.

Special features include a number of interviews with actors, writers, and producers, and features on Dax and other characters. There are no commentaries, which is unfortunate. STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE was a mixed up show from the beginning, never quite sure what it was about or what it wanted to accomplish, and even the much-hyped Dominion War can't quite redeem it.",1237420800,,2806,4.864016736401673
803746,5,6304132360,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. They are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker cannot say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Parents respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors' DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. However these collectors' boxes are being replaced by the new slim line boxes that are cheaper. These are simply a cardboard holder with four to five slim DVD case holders with 1 to 2 discs in each holder (The slim line boxes do not contain the special collectors' DVD-ROM). There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Often the bonus disc may contain the last episode or two of the season, so watch out for those. Sometimes the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they were filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they were filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season six is mostly about the retaking of DS9 back from the Dominion and Cardassians, saving the Alpha quadrant and the death of one of the leads.

The same crew is back. DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko. Jake Sisko is his son. Odo is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief O'Brien is chief engineer. Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor. Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian. The Cardassian Garak helps Sisko. Rom and Nog are fully operating as part of Starfleet. Also Weyoun, a male Vorta, who appeared prominently in season five features extensively in season six.

Season Six of DS9 is mostly about undercover missions, Jem'Hadar, Worf's son, the DS9 occupation, morale, Dukat's daughter, Klingon weddings, Vedek Bareil, genetic-engineering, Quark's mother, Dukat's madness, Morn, racism, shrinking, mobsters, duty vs. relations, Kira's mother, Section 31, Romulans, Vic Fontaine, wraiths, red squad, Ferengi law, Molly O'Brien, distress calls and the death of a crew member.

Best episodes are Sacrifice of Angels, You Are Cordially Invited..., One Little Ship, Inquisition, In the Pale Moonlight, His Way, The Reckoning, Valiant, Tears of the Prophets.

DS9 Season six is the best of seasons one to six. A few dodgy episodes aside this season is clearly outstanding in all departments. The leads are strongly engaged in their roles and the Dominion War is in full swing with lots of movie quality battle sequences. The Defiant is now as popular as the DS9 station itself. The Founders, the Vorta and Cardassians make for a compelling enemy. Following on from the darker ending to season five the full invasion looming through the wormhole brings with it lots of suspense. DS9 has been transformed into Terok Nor and the crew must battle to get it back. The CGI in this season is a huge leap for the Star Trek series in general. It really is movie quality and the battles are colossal. The last episode however sees an important crew member who has been with DS9 since season one die. The wormhole also has a serious problem and it looks like the DS9 team will never be the same. So we look to season seven to pick up the broken pieces and wonder how the Federation will ever be able to stop the shadowy forces that threaten their freedom.

803747,5,6304132360,"I cannot express enough superlatives about Season Six of Deep Space Nine.  Even though it has been about a decade since this season aired on television, the stories never get old and the storylines are always enjoyable.  There are quite a few episodes that are vying for my favorite...""Far Beyond The Stars"", ""Profit and Lace"", etc.  Knowing that the upcoming season, Season Seven, is the last of the televised episodes, it makes me wish that movies will be made with the cast of this series.  A Deep Space Nine movie is L-O-N-G OVERDUE!!!!!!!",1230249600,4,543,4.806451612903226
803748,5,6304132360,"After I watched this episode again recently, it set me thinking about a lot of things that I not only saw with this particular version of Star Trek, but science fiction as a whole. The episode 'Far Beyond the Stars' is easily the high-water mark for this entire show, despite the fact that it was completely separate from the main and ongoing story-line of the show. This episode actually stands by itself much like 'Inner Light' does with Next Generation and 'City on The Edge of Forever' with the Original Series.

The main thought, and I won't even bother to say premise, is that the ever lingering question that plagued this show and made things abrasive for many of the cast members was openly and very adroitly addressed here.

The question being: Can a show have a black Captain, or a black hero as the driving force?'

Avery Brooks as Captain Benjamin Sisko suffered under this plague the entire time that the show ran. While many think that Hollywood is colorblind, it just isn't the case. Tensions from this show probably derailed much of what was going on with Star Trek in the nineties and quite possibly damaged the franchise for a long time to come, much like a butterfly effect. I'm sure the producers would disagree. Of course they would. I'm not saying that it was the fault of Avery Brooks or because they cast a black Captian and that it was a bad idea. Not at all. On the contrary.

The executives in charge of DS9, as well as the head writers were openly hostile towards Brooks and even through the seven years the show ran, the problems continued and never seemed to fade until finally, the show ended. Star Trek lore is rife with information about the relationships between Avery Brooks, Brannon Braga and Steven Behr. Let's just say it mirrors what Albert R. Broccoli once said about Sean Connery as James Bond when they were originally trying to get Carey Grant: 'He's not exactly what I was looking for'.

This episode speaks to this tension, in my opinion, more than anything. Not being a trekkie without inside knowledge doesn't diminish it either. Benjamin Sisko is 'Benny', stuck as a black science-fiction writer in 1950's America, during Jim Crow, Segregation and probably just before the bulk of the civil rights movement and dreaming of a better future for all of us, not just himself. The episode in this context is bleak and has the same sinister feeling that most of the DS9 episodes had, but deals directly with every day issues. It was a stroke of genius to have a science fiction show set 200 years in the future deal with an issue that is apparently 50 years in our past, but still relevant and eye-opening. Should this episode have won a Hugo Award? Yes. Without any doubt in the world. In 1998, when this episode and aired and would have been a contender, it never even got a mention. The Hugo in 1998 went to the film 'Contact'. Just shameful. I wonder if it had anything to do with 'a Black Captain'?

The struggle Benny is going through in this, shows the pain that all writers must endure on some level, some more than others. Charles Bukowski, suffered much like our good friend Benny and once stated: 'The Gods have really put a shield on me'. I've truncated that quote for reasons that are obvious to anyone that has read Bukowski. I fall apart every time I watch this episode because Avery Brooks depiction of the frustrated writer, caged in like a parakeet, is very true and very well-acted. It's painful to watch, not because of the intensity that he's going through on-screen, but because every word and gesture he emits is more than true. You can feel on some deeper level that you're seeing the events of perhaps thousands of peoples lives. It takes you all the way back to another question: 'Does the caged bird still sing?'

His soliloquy of 'you cannot destroy an idea' is powerful and so in the face of everybody that has never faced a day like this, a moment like this, a life like this.

I don't want to recap the entire episode as many folks have already done that. Watch the episode if you haven't seen it, you're really are missing out if you haven't. If it's been awhile revisit it, it's honestly Star Trek's finest hour, bar none.

This episode 'Far Beyond The Stars' is from Season 6 and is Episode 13. It premiered February 11th, 1998.",1224979200,5,4304,4.579220779220779
803749,4,6304132360,"Deep Space Nine goes where the other Star Trek series rarely did.  After the first few seasons, DS9 steered away from the techno-babble and ""we can solve it with science"" approach (which is often the complaint against Star Trek in general), and moved into the darker side of Trek and inter-planetary society.

The sixth and seventh seasons of Deep Space Nine are must buys for any fan.  If you own one, you have to own the other, they not only go together, but more importantly, it is the point at which the series takes its darkest plot twists, and really becomes all about war, and the social and political issues surrounding it.  There are some fun and less heavy episodes of course, as Star Trek has always done so well, but there is no lack of action in this DVD set.

If you're trying to decide on only one season, don't make the mistake of passing over season seven.  It has by far the most involved and dark storyline, which season six lacks at times.  Season six is not on the same level as season seven.  Don't get me wrong.  This season (6) is still great, but not quite as good as the next one.  Still, for any fan of the series, season six is a must buy, (you can get tired of watching season 7 over and over), and it completes the storyline that culminates in season 7 and the last episode.",1212710400,2,1304,4.329218106995885
803750,4,6304132360,"Highlights and memorable moments of the entertaining sixth season of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" include a big six-episode arc right out of the gate that immerses us in the war with the Dominion (to be clear, we're not talking about a six-parter telling one story, but six episodes-  some continued and some stand-alone- that deal exclusively with the war); a fair number of excellent non-war episodes (my favorite is the tribute to 1940's pulp sci-fi writers, ""Far Beyond the Stars""); James Darren as holo-crooner Vic Fontaine, who offers both wisdom AND great song stylings to the DS9 crew; and the usual assorted, top-notch, character moments, special effects, and guest stars.

Even the obligatory ""funny Ferengi episode"" this season, ""Profit and Lace"", is watchable, if more for its bizarre qualities (Quark undergoes a temporary sex change and Rom is apparently revealed to be a closet cross dresser) than for actually being funny.

Finally, a well-crafted (though maybe a bit too busy) season finale- laced with huge battles, dark mysticism, and high tragedy- draws the curtain on the season in high style.  I liked the way the season finale was genuinely complex: it had a ""happy ending"" as far as the Dominion War was concerned (the Federation made some major advances) but things are decidedly less happy on the personal front, as doubt, confusion, and death confront our characters.

A generous series of interviews and behind-the-scenes features round out the last disc, once again providing an illuminating and entertaining cap to these well-packaged season-long Trek boxed sets.",1197936000,,1593,5.20703125

While I expected the season to wrap it up at some point, much like real wars, it kept going, almost to the point where it was part of their regular life.  The show was very dark in spots, but made up for it in a number of very light and fun episodes, involving Worf and Dax's wedding, and several fun ferengi episodes.

803753,5,6304132360,"Season Six aired the episode 'Far Beyond the Stars'. The title itself a 'tribute' to the titles SF stories have carried in the past.

In the episode 'Far Beyond the Stars', Captain Benjamin Sisko falls into a dream. In the dream, he's back on earth. The year is 1953. He's writer Benny Russel, and former crew members on Deep Space 9 are his co-workers at the magazine where he works, 'Incredible Tales'.

Benny and Kira (the female writer for Incredible Tales) are told, not to come in to work the next day, company photo day. Benny's given an illustration called 'Air Force Space Station 9' (which looks similar to Deep Space 9) and asked to build a story around the illustration.

Is he, 'Captain Sisko' federation officer and emissary, dreaming he works for 'Incredible Tales'? Or is he a simple writer, dreaming he's dashing 'Captain Sisko'?

When the story is complete Benny turns it in to his editor (Odo). Everyone likes the story, but Odo balks at the Negro captain in the story. ""It's not believable"", he says. Odo can't decide what to do with the story. Benny's told to come back later, to give Odo some time to think it over.

Odo calls Benny into his office, saying, he really likes the story about Captain Sisko and Space Station 9, but, can you change it? ""Make the story, a dream of the Negro kid"". Benny doesn't want the story changed. Odo finally gives in, and decides to publish the story.

1953, perhaps, is not a good time to be 'Benny'. He's called back to the office. Odo tells him, he wanted to publish this story, about Starships, the Federation, and friendship, but higher ups turned it down. In fact he's been given orders to fire Benny. Benny has a nervous break-down and collapses, ""It's real!"". ""It's all real"".",1170720000,,1741,4.618122977346278

I've seen it all, many times over, and in my opinion Season 6 of Deep Space Nine is unmatched in the Star Trek canon and is one of the best seasons of television from the 1990s, in any genre.

Something you need to know:

-you're going to enjoy watching this a lot more if you're already familiar with and interested in the Star Trek universe, and especially if you're familiar with the previous 5 seasons of DS9.  I recommend them all, so if you're coming to this cold turkey you should maybe check out season 1 first.  Why?  Well, Season 6 (and 7) represent a climax of all the plotlines and story threads that had been developed since the 1st and 2nd seasons of the show, and the risings and fallings, the emotional weight of the stories just isn't going to have the same impact if you're not (somewhat) aquainted with the character's back story.

If you are familiar with the earlier seasons of DS9, well, what are you waiting for?  I suppose the most likely viewer of this item is someone who remembers the series from television in the 90s and is considering owning it for re-viewing.  For those of you who for whom the show is completely alien, well, now's as good a time as any to get into it, but for those of you who're mulling over whether it's worth investing in the show, I'd like to go through some of its moments of genius to demonstrate why you should pluck down the cash.

'In the Pale Moonlight' - IMO televised Trek's finest hour.  No episode of DS9 so ably depicts the moral compromises and 'new Trek' that the show was exploring.  Sisko and his crew didn't have the luxury of the moral high ground and unlike their predecessors sometimes had to choose between the lesser of two evils - which is precisely what happens in this episode.  I simply can't recommend it highly enough - I think this hour of television is great and if not for its place in a niche subculture could be considered alongside great films and those rare sublime moments on television.

Waltz - great heroes are ennobled by great villains, and 'Waltz' provides our best look yet at the complex psychology of a madman, Dukat, who contrasts so poorly with the nobility of Sisko.  The moral simplicity of previous Trek villains (the Borg) or their flippancy (Q) simply don't exist in Dukat, a truly evil and deeply disturbed man who is yet simultaneously capable of benevolence.  Again, in DS9, morality is never clear, and though there is a dichotomy in Waltz the lines are still blurred.

Who Mourns for Morn - good comedy is harder to write than good drama, anyone who's put pen to paper knows this.  This is a deligtfully light episode amidst a season of darker ones, that explores the history of one of the many secondary characters on the show, the beloved, if unheard, Morn.  The supporting cast of characters was of course one of the best things about DS9.

Inquisition - introduces Section 31 and yet another Federation moral compromise.  It's so typical of DS9 in episodes like this and 'In the Pale Moonlight' to make Federation officers less like the moral robots of previous (and concurrent) series and at the same time more human.

I could go on and on about every episode, because the season is near flawless (with one notable exception - the less said about Profit and Lace, the better).  If you've read this far and you're not convinced, then I suggest you move on.  But I don't suggest you do.",1159228800,3,3556,4.527386541471048
803755,5,6304132360,"This seasons starts off with the space station being occupied by the Dominion, and how the Federation gets it back! It extends over six episodes and moves with lightning speed. I felt this was the best Trek I had ever seen. The generally peaceful format that was initially launched many years ago has been shattered. This should be expected as humanity moves forward with its relentless exploration of the galaxy.

The most poignant episode is ""Far Beyond the Stars"". It is rather hard to explain unless you have seen it. It may be my personal favorite of the entire series.  There is some hardcore Science Fiction happening here. Most of the episodes are very interesting this season.

The season winds down with with some humorous and down right sad moments. Iggy Pop in his hilarious alien get-up is great!  The Bajoran subplot deepens and Gul Dukat goes mad. The death of Jadzia was one of the saddest episodes I have ever seen. She was one of most intriging characters on the show and it was hard to say good-by...",1150675200,2,1019,4.675977653631285
803833,4,6304132360,"Season six was, in my opinion, one of the best seasons for Deep Space Nine.  In Season Six the Federation has lost Deep Space Nine to the Cardassians and their Dominion allies and the war with the Dominion is only getting bloodier for the Federation and the Klingons.  To me, that was part of what made this particular season so great.  In no other Star Trek series before or after DS9 has war been written so dramatically, so truthfully, and so emotionally.  You can really see Ronald Moore's hand in this season.  Much of the grittiness we see in the Battlestar Galactica seemed to get its genesis here.  Moreover, even with the bloody war around their characters, the writers also found time to write some deeply felt stories of everyday life on the station, and as usual gave each of the main cast an episode that allowed them to shine.  Of particular note in this season is the episode entitled ""Far Beyond the Stars,"" in which Sisko is thrown into an alternate reality where all the cast of DS9 -- minus the makeup; yes, we get to see their real faces! -- plays a role during 1940s/1950s America.  A majority of the cast is a part of a group of early science fiction writers at a time when women had to use initials so the readers wouldn't find out about them, at a time when an African-American writer (played beautifully by Avery Brooks) had to hide color of his skin.  By far, it is the best depiction of racism in Star Trek ever.  Above all, it was perfect science fiction.  Not only did it discuss the issue of racism, but it was an homage to the early science fiction writers who were paid pennies to put out good, and bad, sci-fi stories that fired the imagination of a generation of future science fiction writers.  It was Star Trek at its finest, and this episode deserved far more attention than it ever received. It was certainly Emmy worthy in the tradition of the Twilight Zone.

In addition to ""Far Beyond the Stars,"" the wedding of Worf and Jadzia Dax was a comedic delight.  I always liked the pairing of Worf and Jadzia much more than the forced pairing of Troi and Worf in the last season of Star Trek: TNG.  Michael Dorn and Terry Farrell had fantastic chemistry.  This pairing is also what makes me put the ""Almost"" in my title.  I remember at the time the sixth season was coming to an end that Farrell and the producers of DS9 were at an impasse concerning her salary for the seventh and final season, so in their infinite wisdom the producers decided to kill the character of Jadzia Dax in a very crappy way.  After two seasons of building this relationship up and to see the character killed off like that was just stupid.  Money or not, the seventh season would have been a heck of a lot better, a heck of a lot more fun if Terry Farrell had been there. Of course, there is nothing wrong with Nicole deBoer -- she's great in The Dead Zone -- but too much time was wasted trying to integrate a new character into the final season, and she just wasn't Jadzia.

Except for that final part, this season of Deep Space Nine is definately worth the price to own.",1145750400,7,3086,4.409171075837743

803836,5,6304132360,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 6) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""A Time to Stand"" in which Sisko is relieved of his command of the Defiant. With Deep Space Nine having been abandoned to the Dominion, the Federation is on the verge of losing the war. Sisko is placed in command of a captured Jem'Hadar spaceship and tasked with a dangerous mission which jeopardizes the lives of everyone onboard... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""Statistical Probabilities"" in which the crew must analyze the probably of a desirable outcome from the proposed peace treaty with the Dominion, and ""Time's Orphan"" in which Molly O'Brien wanders into a vortex that sends her centuries into the past, but when the crew retrieves her, it's an older version of Molly...

803837,2,6304132360,"Before you go laundering how great DS9 is I think you should watch B5 from season 1-5, then you release that DS9 is a copy.

For example from seasons 1-4 the programme was about finding all the missing Bajoran orbs, but after season 4 nothing is metioned of it, yes we have The Dominion War, and that was good, but then we have Bajoran profits vs Pi raths (or DS9's response to Shadows v Vorlons) section 31 (DS9's version of Nightwatch) not only was the change of direction bland, but it completly ruined the complex of the story!!!

Compared to B5 this is B side material, thank God it gets the recognition it deserves now, B5 showed the way forward and Star Trek ok maybe it adapted, but why this series, and it ruined it so much, the characters seemed to become different overnight, example Odo and Kira (DS9's Sheridan & Delenn) all of a sudden fall in love with out any incling (from season 4, Odo is suddenly in love with Kira, although previously in other seasons there seemed no chemistry)

Not to say there aren't good moments, the recapture of DS9 is great, and the death of Dax is a superb episode, and The Worf and Dax love relationship is the only one that I feel truely had any chemistry (Worf entered in season 4, hmmm I wonder???)

I actually really like Star Trek, I think TNG is the best series, followed by TOS, then Voyager (up till series 5, then it became Porno in space), DS9 (especially seasons 3 and 4), and then the real porno in space Enterprise!!!!",1122336000,2,1477,4.419117647058823
803838,5,6304132360,"You just can't get much better than this from ANY Star Trek series ... and I am a diehard fan who grew up watching the original in syndication (was born in 1973 -- lol), The Next Generation (which is also fabulous, but still not as good as Deep Space 9), Voyager and Enterprise.

Season 6 & 7 are darker than dark.  Due to the Dominion War you see a transformation in the characters that is perfect.  By the time you end out the season and the complete DS9 series, you know so much about these characters that they feel like family!

You get to see how the war is taking its toll on the Captain and its crew when all their colleagues are coming home in body bags, you see how 1 lone alien who is part of the race who started the Dominion war struggles with what his people are doing then is inflicted with a deadly disease by a secret section of The Federation (the infamous SECTION 31, lol)  to wipe out the Dominion aliens; You see how Captain Sisko's connection to the religion that adopted him (since he was never religious until he came to DS9) builds and plays a huge role in his life and where the path of The Prophets lead him.

You see how Gul Dukat (former glorious military leader of Cardassia, now cast out and shamed) becomes mad and starts to lose himself and his mind in the evil religion of the people he helped to occupy and destroy (Bajorins and the occupation of Bajor); his closest aid (Gul Damar) changes from a proud soldier of Cardassia under Gul Dukat's rule, to a Dominion collaborator, to a freedom fighting revolutionary against the Dominion and ultimately a war hero to his people.

I could go on and on and on ... There is so much depth in the later seasons of Deep Space 9 that you could drown.

Seasons 6 & 7 are fabulous ... even if you purchase them on their own without the rest of the seasons (although not quite sure other than money why you'd do that).

I've said it to my friends before and I will say it to Amazon readers now --  there is absolutely no way that DS9 should not be considered the best Star Trek series of all the Star Trek series!  I love them all, but *HANDS DOWN* DS9 * IS * THE * BEST.  If you are not engulfed by this series then you just don't like dark dramas.  I've heard a lot of TNG fans rag on DS9.  There are some major differences between them, one being that the TNG crew is constantly moving and the DS9 crew is stationary.  You know what I think?  The writing had to be deeper and more involved on DS9 because of the very fact that the crew was stationary -- -- I'm sure it was a much greater challenge to write for them.

You TNG fans... Don't rag on DS9!!  You cannot compare apples to oranges.  Have faith in the Prophets... They will guide you!! LOL  ;)",1117324800,4,2726,4.2057692307692305

In an unprecedented move in Star Trek, the season begins with an arc that is altogether some of the most dazzling Trek to ever grace the small screen.
From the commencement of the season, it is quite evident that the season is going to be big in so many ways.  From the war with the Dominion to many of the payoff's between the characters that have, in some cases, been building since the first season.  Worf and Jadzia's marriage, Odo and Kira finally getting together and Dukat's turn for even the worst are just ""some"" of the season's highlights.
I stand by my opinion that Terry Farrell's decision to leave the show to do a sitcom that she was later ""released"" from stands right up there with Denise Crosby's decision to leave STNG, ""not too smart!""
As is the usual, the writing, directing and performances by all for this continuation on the saga that is Deep Space Nine are all extraordinary!
A brief synopsis of the more outstanding episodes of the season:
A Time to Stand to Sacrifice of Angels - In this brilliant and unprecedented six episode arc the shows producers takes us from where the fifth season concluded through many of the machinations of the initial stages of the war with the Dominion.  Integral to these first six episodes is some the series most extraordinary writing, directing and acting that all lend greatly to this six episode arc being tops among all of the Star Trek episodes ever, from any of the series.
You Are Cordially Invited - Despite the war still raging, in this great episode, we see Star Trek's first Klingon wedding between Worf and Jadzia.  Beyond the festivities of the episode, you can truly tell that the actors were having a great time as well.
The Magnificent Ferengi - Iggy Pop makes a guest appearance as a Vorta in this great first Ferengi episode of the season where the Dominion captures Quark and Rom's Moogie.
Waltz - Gul Dukat makes a return to the series after the death of his daughter, Ziyal.  Coupling that death with his downfall as the leader of the Cardassian Union has seriously demented his views and Sisko finds himself being the object of Dukat's quest for revenge.
Far Beyond the Stars - Hailed as the series most poignantly well written, directed and performed episode, this episode should've received many more awards than it did.  Through his connection to the prophets, Sisko finds himself switching between two different realities; his life on DS9 and a life in which he's a struggling writer in the fifties on Earth and dealing first hand with racism at its worst.
One Little Ship - As an homage to other great Sci-Fi movies, the producers decided to shrink a runabout and it turned out perfectly for this episode in which Bashir, Dax and O'Brien are stuck in a shrunken runabout while the Defiant is taken over by Jem'Hadar.
Honor Among Thieves - DS9 does a mob show as O'Brien is forced to work under cover in the Orion Syndicate and this show works extraordinarily well, highlighting Colm Meaney's talents as a brilliant actor.
Change of Heart - Worf's devout devotion to duty is and his devotion to his wife are brought to the forefront and in conflict in this episode in which they find themselves on a mission to pick up a spy but Jadzia is injured.
In the Pale Moonlight - This episode is the most dramatically well written and performed episode of the season as Sisko finds he is no longer capable of dealing with the casualties of the war and he devises a plan to bring the Romulans into the fold from their neutral status which also prompts him to deal directly with Garak.
His Way - After six long years of pinning over Kira, Odo's greatest wish comes true after the introduction of Vic Fontaine, DS9's resident lounge singer.
Valiant - Nog takes on a larger and more interesting role in this episode in which he and Jake find themselves on board the USS Valiant which is being run by Starfleet Academy's Red Squadron and a fanatical but inexperienced captain.
Profit and Lace - In this extremely funny Ferengi episode, Grand Nagus Zek is deposed by Brunt and Zek comes to DS9 to enlist the aid of Quark.
Time's Orphan - This O'Brien episode speaks greatly for the producers ability to write good family shows when Molly is drawn into a time portal and Miles is able to retrieve her but not the child that entered the portal but a teenage version of her.
Tears of the Prophets - In this extraordinary season closer, the war is still raging but the Federation is taking an upper hand and the Dominion is looking for some way to turn events in their favor.  To their relief Dukat makes a return and his sudden addiction with the prophets does more than they could hope for, causing the wormhole itself to close and Sisko loses his connection with the prophets, causing him to go home to Earth, defeated.  Here is where actress Terry Farrell made the decision to leave the show and the death of Jadzia comes about.  {ssintrepid}

803931,5,6304132360,"Yes, the series starts off extremely promising, with a 6-story arc that covers the Dominion War and the effort to regain Deep Space 9. However, once the station is re-taken, the series seems to fall back into the standard pattern of previous seasons. This is not altogether bad, but it does feel awkward. Yes, the war is still on in the background, but it grows more and more in the background throughout the middle of the season. Significant accomplishments are somehow forgotten or written away (take, for example, the elimination of the White replenishment facility).
In reality, I feel that many of the stories are obvious attempts to catapult Deep Space 9 into the forefront of the then-burgeoning sci-fi field. That's not to say that these are not good stories; many of them are GREAT stories! But the competition was fierce: Babylon 5, Star Trek Voyager, and even the X-Files were there, seeking to be the best sci fi show on the market.
Take, for example, the highly acclaimed ""Far Beyond on the Stars."" Watched as a single episode, it is quite good. But put in context of the competition of shows like Babylon 5, the show seems to take on a whole new meaning. Every time I see Sisko fall to his knees wailing after he is fired from the newspaper, I can almost hear the writers saying, ""Why didn't you give us two Hugo awards? We had the black captain!!!"" Babylon 5 won its first Hugo Award  for Best Dramatic Presentation in its second year with ""The Coming of Shadows,"" beating Deep Space 9's ""The Visitor."" In 1997, Babylon 5 again won with ""Severed Dreams."" In a not-so-subtle way, I get the funny feeling that the writers of the show were actually attempting to persuade the Hugo people that if they did not give the award to Deep Space 9 in this season, they were probably racists...hmmmm...who can tell what they were attempting to really say...
Anyway, apart from a handful of stories that feel a bit contrived, the season is solid. It also has a strong tear-jerking O'Brien/Keiko story in ""Time's Orphan."" No, it has nothing to do with the Dominion War, but I have always felt that the O'Brien/Keiko stories are particularly strong stand-alones. There is a real chemistry between the two actors (Rosalind Chao is an excellent actress), and each season seems to have one O'Brien family story that is particularly poignant.
This season is definitely worth owning. With so many good characters in Deep Space 9, you find yourself wanting to know when you will see one of your favorite characters show up again. All in all, a sign of significant accomplishment.",1069459200,2,2573,4.743303571428571
803932,4,6304132360,"The spaceship made the difference. TOS, TNG and Voyager had ships. They had episodic adventures every week. The absentee viewer -the ones who watched only once in while -thought all these shows were better than DS9 because there was no continuing stories. No need to really pay attention to characters, because the Temporal Reset Button would be hit during the last five minutes, and then the crew was jaunting off for a new adventure. Plus the bad guys had to come to them.

For some, DS9's serialization -especially in these final two seasons - would prevent any new viewers from watching. As I said, some had watched TOS, TNG and Voyager because every week the crew would meet new aliens. But DS9 was always conceived as a stationary show. Thus it forced the writers to create dozens of adjuvant roles, supplementary characters, and recurring characters -eventually, they would create nearly 30! And at times, because of this, it was hard for new fans to get involved.

This almost serialization grew deeper, as the sixth season opened with a 6-episode story arc. ""A Time to Stand"" opens three months into the Dominion/Cardassian alliance. The war is not going well for the Federation and since DS9 is now in the hands of the enemy, the crew works from the Defiant. A plan is hatched to destroy a ketracel-white facility -after Sisko's crew mines the wormhole, the Dominion must produce the life giving force for the Jem'Hadar. Of course, things don't go as plan...

The arc includes ""Rocks and Shoals"", ""Sons and Daughters"" (perhaps the weakest story in the series), ""Behind Enemy Lines"", ""Favor the Bold"", and ""Sacrifice of Angels."" Other highlights include the hilarious wedding of Worf and Jadzia in ""You Are Cordially Invited"", ""Resurrection"", ""Statistical Probabilities"", ""The Magnificent Ferengi"", ""Waltz"", ""Who Mourns for Morn?"" ""One Little Ship"", ""Honor Among Thieves"",  ""His Way"" (which introduced the hologram character of Vic Fontaine and the love affair of Kira and Odo) and ""Profit and Lace""

Also included in the season was ""Far Beyond on the Stars"", a brilliantly written, acted, directed (by series star Avery Brooks) tale about racism. It's a wonderful hour that takes straightforward and honest look at a time when life for African Americans was -despite some positive steps -difficult. All the regular actors appeared out of make-up in various roles as writers at the fictional Incredible Tales. It is simply one of the best hours produced for the show.

Also included was ""In the Pale Moonlight"", perhaps the darkest episode of Trek ever produced.  With the war going badly for the Federation, and with Betazed (Counselor Deanna Troi's home world) now in enemy hands, Sisko decides he has to get the Romulan's involved (who've maintained a distant ""no involvement"" policy). But to do so, Sisko will need to compromise some of his values as a Starfleet officer; or as Garak puts it: ""That's why you came to me, isn't it, Captain? Because you knew I could do those things that you weren't capable of doing. Well it worked, and you'll get what you want: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have saved the entire Alpha Quadrant and all it cost was the life of one Romulan Senator, one criminal and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.""

Pretty heavy stuff.

Finally, in the season ender, ""Tears of the Prophets"", we say goodbye to a regular cast member, as Gul Dukat ends the life of a beloved Starfleet officer and closes the wormhole, cutting off all chances for Bajor and, ironically, the Dominion. In a sad and open-end conclusion, Sisko returns to Earth to take stock of his life and where it's going.

Elsewhere, the war continues",1069027200,6,3818,4.905426356589147
803933,5,6304132360,"The sixth season of DS9 was a considerable challenge to all involved: the ongoing war with the Dominion lead to the loss of the space station to the Cardassian/Dominion alliance; Dukat crossed over to the dark side completely as he sold his soul to become the head of the new Cardassian government; Worf and Dax married; Odo romances Major Kira and, finally, Section 31 reared its ugly little head recalling the hysteria of the McCarthy era Communist witch hunts.
With more of the cast stepping behind the camera and an influx of vets from Next Generation helping out as well, DS9 managed to maintain its roots but continue to forge its own, unique dark identity among the Trek franchise. There were so many plot threads dangling from previous seasons that they could easily have gummed up the storytelling in season 6. Instead, they provided just the right amount of variety and allowed the conflict between the Dominion and Federation to continue without it becoming too tiresome.
If that wasn't enough there was a unique story that was every bit as special as Trials and Tribb-ulations from season 5; the brilliant Far Beyond The Stars (written by Ira Steven Behr and Hans Beimler from a story by Twilight Zone vet Marc Scott Zicree)allows Ben Sisko to venture into the past with a twist; he's a 1950's science fiction writer working for Incredible Tales of Scientific Wonder Magazine. The crew is there as well inhabiting similar roles. Sisko's main story is called Deep Space 9 about the very troubled space station whose crew are caught in the midst of interstellar war. It's a powerful episode that transcends its cleverness to become a great episode of science fiction television (and not just a great Trek moment).
The season ends with the murder of Jadzia Dax at the hands of the villianous Gul Dukat. Suddenly, Worf moves from Newlywed to grief stricken husband all within the span of 26 episodes. Tears of the Prophet also has major changes in store for Sisko, the wormhole and DS9. If the original Star Trek and Next Generation are an example of the franchise childhood and adolescence, then DS9 represents its adulthood. The series continued to deal with complex story lines, themes and dark moments that made it a very real adult series. The Trek franchise never improved from DS9. It has continued (with mixed results)but is missing the risk taking that characterized DS9.
There are quite a few digital compression artifacts visible particularly if you watch the film in progressive scan mode. Still, squeezing 4 episodes of DS9's dark, rich and active frames onto a single dual layered disc comes fraught with problems. On the whole the boxed sets have looked pretty good considering how many episodes are squeezed onto each disc. The 5.1 sound hasn't been used to maximum advantage on any of the DS9 sets but they do sound pretty good overall and are an improvement over Next Gen's boxed sets.
The extras appear to be promising but, once again, Paramount has chosen not to allow there to be any writer/director/actor audio commentaries. With a series this rich and full of interesting characters, DS9 would benefit from a couple of the key episodes having a commentary track. Ira Steven Behr would be the prime candidate (since he and Robert Hewitt Wolfe more or less ran the show day to day after Pillar left)for an audio commentary. It's a pity as DS9 certainly warrants boundiful extras.
Still, this is a rich season full of strong writing/direction and acting that looks good if not spectacular on DVD. The dark DVD transfer is a major improvement over many of the home videos and released. Is this the best season of DS9? It would definitely be a close match between season 5 and 6. Season 7 had many memorable moments but it lacked the dynamic tension of these particular two seasons.",1068940800,6,3808,4.8420245398773005
803934,5,6304132360,"The highlights of this one are Worf's marriage to Dax. It was great to see him get together with someone other than Counselor Troi from Next Generation. Though short lived; it made the series a better one. In DS9 we had the O'Brien's, Odo and Kira and now Worf/Dax.  It's a contrast to Next Generation, which didn't show a lot of depth in the interpersonal relationships.
Far Beyond the Stars takes Sisko to another dimension where he is a science fiction writer facing racism in the 50's. In this one he is the creator of a Deep Space Nine saga. The editor won't publish it. Not only will the editor not publish his story but he won't consider any of his work good enough for publication. This tale is by far the most poignant and heart wrenching of all the series.
As usual the set is light on extras, but the episodes more than make up for it. If Paramount ever issues this seven season set as one unit; (like the UK Borg Box of seven seasons of Next Gen) it should have a lot more in the way of episode commentary and interviews.
For what you are paying; a lot more in the extras could have been produced for such a great series. I still have to give it five stars. The episodes surpass the final ones in the last season.",1068336000,2,1225,4.280172413793103

The episode ""In The Pale Moonlight"" is a great example of the mastery that this show was capable of. Philosphically it's perfect, and morally wrong at the same time. Pretty nifty. Box 5 is a masterpiece as well, and 7 will be alright, but it doesn't get much better than this.

The first six episodes are in serialized arc format, and they rule. You will never look at Star Trek the same way after viewing them. The rest of the season is equally worthy, paritcularly ""Far Beyond the Stars""; a retro-episode that tackles racism efficiently, and poignantly. If you're new to DS9, I'd recommend Seasons 3, 5, or 6 to start off with (although it is ideally better to start from the beginning). It's a highly complicated show, with arcs running throughout the seven year run, and more characters than any show could ever boast to have. A must for any fan of true Drama, and Sci-Fi.",1068163200,,754,4.551470588235294

804007,5,6304132360,"It's hard for me to pick any one season of DS9 as being the best, but season 6 is perhaps the most interesting season of all. The reason for this is that they took several risks.
One of them of course is the use of long, involved story lines. Almost more than any othe sci-fi series (with the possible exception of Babylon 5), DS9 showed that war was a messy, complicated business, not just in terms of body count but in compromised values, shifting allegiences, and tough decisions that may or may not be right. Sisko truly comes into his own as the leader of the station as well as a key figure in the war. The highlight of the main war story arc is In the Pale Moonlight, a true masterpiece of storytelling about the seamy side of  war. Almost as good as this exceptional episode in the general story line is Inquisition, which introduces the KGB- or even Gestapo? -like Section 31(and they work for the good guys!)
Every Trek season has it's off-topic type of episodes, and season 6's are some of the best. Even the Ferengi episodes are not that bad - The Magnificent Ferengi is a comic highlight. Who Mourns for Morn is uneven but nevertheless makes use of one of the most famous non-speaking parts on TV, Morn the barfly. Statistical Probabilities is a very interesting intellectual episode that furthers the story of Julian Bashir as a genetically enhanced human, and shows what can go wrong with such ""enhancements"". Valiant shows the effect of war on kids (a young Academy squad who somehow end up commanding their own ship after the death of their captain). One Little Ship is a ridiculous but totally fyn episode (Honey, I Shrunk The Runabout!) His Way introduced James Darren as Vic Damone, a holographic night club owner with self-awareness - since Voyager was pursuing the idea of a hologram being a sentient being, this was nice to see - and Vic becomes an important secondary character in season 7. Worf and Jadzia Dax's wedding (You Are Cordially Invited) is a bit cheesy, as many Kllingon episodes tend to be. But the Worf-Jadzia relationship was one of the very few marriages shown in Trek (aside from the O'Briens), and later episodes managed to show the difficulties of being in the same war with the one you love quite effectively, until the death of Jadzia in the last episode. The death itself was quite abrupt - almost up there with the death of Tasha Yar in TNG, but in the context of war it makes sense. Death in war is senseless...
I left the best for last - Far Beyond The Stars. This is a transcendent episode, and a must-see for any sci-fi fan - even if you don't like Trek. It asks the question, are we real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? And what is it that makes what we dream of? This idea was explored somewhat in a Next Generation episode (Message In A Bottle), but it's really told beautifully here.
I can't really think of a truly bad episode in this season, like a couple of the clunkers in both season 5 and 7. All in all, this season is a keeper.",1067212800,27,3009,4.48087431693989
804008,5,6304132360,"I also have to register my complaint with Paul Tonks' rather ignorant and dismissive editorial review for DS9's 6th season, which I consider to be its most complete and satisfying overall.
The famed 6-part story arc isn't famous because they tried it, it's famous because it succeeded. Even the weakest ep of the 6, Sons and Daughters, did its part to move the compelling storylines along in an interesting way. And Rocks and Shoals is DS9 doing what it does best: showing fascinating aspects of the Trek universe (and its inhabitants) without having to fly around in a ship greeting the alien of the week.
It's generally accepted that few episodes of any Trek series were as powerful or compelling as In the Pale Moonlight, which Tonks neglects to even mention. He decries the overabundance of humourous episodes, but it seems he forgot to watch some of the most important 'serious' eps in order to come to his conclusion.  And Far Beyond the Stars, while packed with humorous moments, isn't a 'comedy' episode at all.  It deals with subjects such as racism and segregation from a Trek vantage point.
As for the comic eps, yes, there are several, and while Profit and Lace is a Ferengi stinker, The Magnificent Ferengi is probably the best Ferengi ep in the series' history.  You Are Cordially Invited is a treat for fans of any Trek show or movie, as it uncovers even more aspects of Klingon culture and mating rituals.  And while some may not have been fans of the Kira/Odo pairing, His Way was a very clever way to finally bring it out into the open, adding another great recurring character in the mix in Vic Fontaine.
As for Tears of the Prophets, it was an abrupt way to have Terry Farrell exit the show, but for anyone who knows what the Dax character is about, killing Jadzia is the only way to have the Dax character live on in the form of another host body, which is how Ezri Dax came to be in Season 7.
Season 6 was all about risk taking for DS9, and I think it paid off in some of the best hours of Trek ever seen.",1066435200,4,2027,4.47027027027027
804009,5,6304132360,"I'm mainly posting this in oposition to the editorial above. This person does not know Trek very well to not recognize what is by far the best season of Deep Space Nine and argueable, the best season of all Star Trek.
The introduction of Section 31 gave everyone something to talk about. Far Beyond the Stars was an artistic masterpeice. And the death of Jadzia Dax, I must say, the writer of the editorial has it all wrong. Terry Farrell wanted to leave the show. True enough, she didn't want her character killed, but she did make the decision to leave. That may make her character's departure seem out of place, but none the less appropriate. The Dominion War has been faught, officially and unofficially since Season 3 (which began with major tensions with them) and lasted until the very last episode of the series. It is only logical to conclude that someone will die. Sisko reads through thousands of names of casualties at the hands of the Dominion, yet he never lost anyone of his crew until Jadzia. This makes it much more potent...it makes the war seem personal...and the Devil (Dukat) is a more real enemy to Sisko than the Dominion.

Quite possibly the strongest season of all. But the seventh year would give it a run for it's money.",1064534400,5,414,4.845070422535211
804011,3,6304132360,"CAPTIVE PURSUIT is a nicely understated episode featuring some solid performances from the regular cast and crew.  The first season is still young, so it's good to see them focusing on individual characters rather than trying to cram everyone into the mix, regardless of how well they fit a particular episode.
The first alien from the Gamma Quadrant accidentally finds himself journeying through the wormhole and arriving at the Deep Space Nine station.  Although he comes from the other side of the galaxy, he looks pretty much the same as most other types of aliens that we see in Star Trek; it's up to Scott McDonald's performance to put some feeling of otherness into the creature, and he succeeds admirably.  O'Brien attempts to gain the alien's confidence to learn what he is up to as well as opening ties to life-forms from the other side.  The alien, who describes both his species and himself simply as ""Tosk"", is reluctant to talk, sparking discussion among the station crew that he may be an escaped prisoner or a wanted fugitive.
I liked how relaxed the first contact with an alien from the Gamma quadrant was.  I'd imagine this same story taking place on the Next Generation ship would have involved a lot of pomp and circumstance, and it would have stretched over two commercial breaks, punctuated with long speeches delivered by Patrick Stewart.  Here, O'Brien just wanders up to the guy and asks if he needs any help fixing the ship.  The two characters work well together, and the episode's most successful scenes are those of the pair trying to learn about each other's culture.  It really is standard science-fiction stuff, but the two actors make even the more hackneyed dialog sound fresh.
This could very easily been a rather bland episode, but it's rescued by good performances and some clever dialog.  For me, Star Trek is often at its best when focusing on the smaller-scale stuff, when it remembers to allow the characters to have some depth.  And that's just what we have here.",1060041600,,2005,4.819241982507289
804012,5,6304132360,"Watching DS9's sixth season,you come to realise that it's far removed from the premise of a darker edgier Trek of  the first two seasons ,only to emerged as the greatest Trek show of all time.
The writing had become more ambitious than any other latter day Trek Series(TNG,VOY,ENT),and it was only the penultimate season. The six-part Dominion War Arc(including classic episodes A Time To Stand,Rocks & Shoals,The Sacrifice Of Angels) showed the producers going for broke as well as establishing DS9 as a show that's not afraid to take chances.
 The best season six episodes are too many to list(....Cordially Invited...,Waltz,Far Beyond The Stars,Inquisition,His Way,Reckoning,The Valient),but it's In The Pale Moonlight that is the highlight of the entire season(as well as my 3rd favorite episode behind season one's ""Duet"",and four's""The Way Of The Warrior"")as Captain Sisko wrestles with his conscience as Garak helps him to dupe the Romulans into joining their efforts in the war.
 The season ends on a dark tone with ""Tears Of The Prophet"" in which Jadzia Dax is killed by a Pah-Wraith possessed Dukat. Although the final season carried on with another Dax,it was a step down which season six staked it's claim as Star Trek's best ever show.",1054512000,4,1248,5.137931034482759
804013,5,6304132360,"For my money, Deep Space Nine's Sixth Season was the series' best, and that is quite a distinction. The show tells stories in this season that are both more epic and more personal than ever before, features genuine twists, great acting, of course, as well as some infinitely memorable moments.
The season begins with a sensational story arc that picks up where season 5's ""A Call to Arms"" left off. The arc is perhaps the show's best, and brings about many developments: Nog becoming an officer, Gul Dukat's daughter getting killed by his second-in-command, Starfleet retaking the station. The show then segues back into its blend of character-based drama and war tales that make this season so good. Character stories are plentiful here and include: Worf and Jadzia tying the knot in ""You are Cordially Invited..."", Bashir being reunited with his not-quite-so-well-adjusted genetically engineered friends in ""Statistical Probabilities"", and Dukat's truly evil nature being exposed in the terriffic ""Waltz"". Marc Alaimo delivers an astonishing portrayal of the once-proud Cardassian Military Leader now a schizoid, hallucinating, paranoid man driven hopelessly mad by his beloved daughter's death. The highlights continue with ""Far Beyond the Stars"", an episode on race relations on Earth, circa 1950, that has echoes of TNG's ""The Inner Light"". But where that episode was warm, this one is painful and uncomfortable, but unmistakeably brilliant. It even ventures into the metaphysical, onto the nature of perception and dreams. A memorable episode. Sisko also had some important development in ""The Reckoning"", where we truly begin to see how great the changes in his soul have become when he is willing to be an Abraham to save Bajor. There were plenty of other character-driven episodes. Chief O'Brien befriends a criminal in ""Honor Among Thieves"", Kira learns the horrible truth about her mother in ""Wrongs Darker..."", and Bashir is recruited into a ultrasecret intelligence agency in ""Inquisition"", which brought us the first glimpse of the amoral Section 31 group, and ""Tears of the Prophets"" has the most shocking plot twist of all, with Dukat becoming indwelt by a Pah-wraith and murdering one of the crew, as well as the disappearance of the wormhole. There were also plenty of lighter moments. ""His Way"" introduces the very popular Vic Fontaine hologram who helps Odo out with his love life. ""The Magnificent Ferengi"" has Quark, Rom, Nog, Brunt and various other Ferengi attempting to free Quark's mother from Dominion incarceration. ""Who Mourns for Morn"" is the only episode dedicated to everyone's favorite barfly, ""One Little Ship"" is a cheeky tribute to old science fiction shows where people become miniaturized.
This season also includes my personal favorite episode. ""In the Pale Moonlight"" is undoubtedly the most spectacular episode that the show ever created. For an episode where nobody leaves the station, nobody gets in a firefight and without even a single scene of space combat, some might wonder how this could be the best episode, let alone one of the most exciting. It is both, in my opinion. The episode centers on Ben Sisko's attempt to gain the Romulans as allies in their fight against the Dominion. In order to do this, Sisko fabricates internal Dominion files, trades a potentially lethal substance for an essential data rod, and becomes indirectly responsible for the death of a Romulan senator. However, the plan soon gets out of Sisko's control, and he must continue down the road paved with good intentions. The episode is beautifully paced, with several twists and a great sudden reversal at the end. One must marvel at the choice that Sisko had to make: save countless lives and compromise your moral integrity or don't and suffer the consequences. A thoroughly nuanced and powerful hour of television, with Avery Brooks' most powerful performance in the run of the show. After watching this episode, it is easy to see why most DS9 fans hail him as Star Trek's best captain. Andrew Robinson as Garak also turns in a memorable performance.
In short, the highlights of this season are too plentiful to list. Buy it.",1048809600,17,4153,5.144970414201183
804014,5,6304132360,"Dear Amazon Customers,
One of the most exciting series of programs in the Star Trek universe returns in its sixth season on DVD. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in season 6 takes on some of the most aggressive story development ever in the Star Trek universe of programs. It is the sixth season that really defines Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as the pinnacle of SCI-FI shows in the Star Trek universe.
In the sixth season, Benjamin Sisko played by ""Avery Brooks"" must come to terms with himself and makes a decision as to his dual roles as the Emissary of Bajor and as a Commander in Starfleet. Even as he leads an assault force that frees the Space Station Deep Space Nine from the clutches of the Cardassians and the Dominion, he finds himself torn having to struggle between both roles. The Federation has asked him on a number of occasions to choose between his dual occupations. In season 6 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Sisko must make his decision.
It is in the sixth season that the audience learns even more about the turmoil inside of the character Odo played by ""Rene Auberjonois"" and his wanting to return the Great Link and to his own people. Troubled at Odo's loyalties to his people, Kira Nerys played by ""Nana Visitor"" confronts Odo with the question as to which side of the war he is on. Odo is caught again with the decision to pick between his love for Major Kira and his desire to return to his own kind. These events leads the two characters into one of the most tremulous period of their lives.
During this season, the character Miles O'Brien played by ""Colm Meaney"" is reunited with his family but is still cautious and tries to protect them from the horrors of war. Although he has never questioned the actions or his loyalty to Starfleet, O'Brien finds himself confronted with the decision to help friends or to blindly follow the orders of his superiors. The writers of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine finally give the opportunity for ""Colm Meaney"" to show some excellent dramatic acting as the character Chief O'Brien.
What would season 6 be without the appearance of the most popular race in the entire Star Trek universe, the Klingons. In season 6 we get to see the wedding between the Klingon character Worf played by ""Michael Dorn"" and the Trill character Jadzia Dax played by ""Terry Farrell"". Their sometimes on again off again romance makes for some interesting dialog between the two but finally it comes to a conclusion with the wedding ceremony which reveals even more about the Klingon society. One of the most aggressive aspects of the show is revealed on the last episode of this season in which both Jadzia Dax and Commander Worf's lives are dramactically affected forever.
Many SCI-FI fans and Trekkers alike will be dazzled this season with the special effects of the first ever space battle scene shown in it's entirety from start to finish. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine had already received accolades for it's special effects in previous episodes but in this season, the audience gets treated to the most spectacular space battle scene ever shown in the Star Trek universe of programs.
I could tell you so much more about this season but the best thing for you to do is purchase Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 6 on DVD. You will find that this season is the absolute best that the Star Trek universe of programs has to offer. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in season 6 reached all new heights in story, character and special effects development which has not been repeated in the Star Trek universe of programs since the airing of this show.

7863648,5,6304132360,i am such a huge fan ds9 and i love this show so much. not as much as my mother though. this was a christmas gift for her and she loved it. working on getting her the entire series. slowly getting there.,1515024000,,203,3.857142857142857
7863649,3,6304132360,"Way too bogged down in the war plus the beginnings of future entanglements with the Pah Wraiths made this season a definite turn for the worst in my opinion. I missed many episodes of this season when it originally aired. I'd tune in, nope, still at war, then skip the next week or two. The war would have been a great story arc for a few episodes, maybe even half of a season, but it gets boring after a while. I enjoyed some of the episodes that were not war-related and a few of the war ones are not bad. DS9 seems to have developed a style of finding something that works then continuing it way too long until it drags down the entire show.",1510963200,,644,4.16

7863651,3,6304132360,"There are some bright spots, and some absolute turkeys, to this endless-war season of DS9. I will say that ""Far Beyond The Stars"" was the highlight episode of the season, if not of the entire series (so fascinating to see these characters we know for so much makeup, sans makeup! The story was fantastic, if a tad corny at the very end. The Dominion war tends to grow weary after awhile, so glad they finally got the station back and returned to some regular stories, but wow, are there some stinkers. Yet another mirror-universe, yet another temporal anomaly or two, and the atrocious Quark gender-change episode, which seemed to go out of it's way to offend. Sorry to see Jadzia go, but the Worf relationship never felt real at all (same with Kira and Odo - just nothing feels real about that.)",1508198400,,796,4.612676056338028
