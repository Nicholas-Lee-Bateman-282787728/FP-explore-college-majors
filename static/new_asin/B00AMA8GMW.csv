5450453,4,B00AMA8GMW,"My son LOVES Dino Dan (he is 2). If you can handle cheesy plot lines then by all means, watch this with your kids. They are educational and entertaining. You don't have to worry about inappropriate situations, dialogue, etc that you have in some kids videos/shows.",1378512000,,264,4.760869565217392
5450454,4,B00AMA8GMW,"It is a good DVD for Dino Dan fans. Good quality video. It has repeats from other Dino Dan dvd's, but if your kid does not mind watching it over and over and makes them happy then why not get it. I would have prefered that the company made a DVD with the entire season, instead of separate, but who am I to criticize; as long as it makes my grandbaby happy I will continue buying them, no matter how many repeats they have.",1376870400,,423,4.0476190476190474
5450455,4,B00AMA8GMW,"My 6 year old was excited when he found out there was a new Dino Dan. We already have all the other DVD's and he has watched them over and over. He said one of the episodes on here is on another one of the DVD's and that's a little disappointing. But, overall I'm glad to add another Dino Dan DVD to our collection. My 2 1/2 year old is starting to like it too, so the more DVD's we have, the better! (Less watching the same episodes over and over...)",1376006400,,451,3.967032967032967

5450457,5,B00AMA8GMW,"Another awesome DVD from NCircle Entertainment! This month we reviewed Dino Dan: Dino Party. It was great! Micah (3) is very picky about what he'll watch, but he sat down and watched this with his siblings. Cadance (8) loves dinosaurs, so she really liked it. The DVD has 5 episodes, making it about 60 minutes long. Heaven (10) said it was a bit young for her, but she still watched it. Cadance said, ""It's really cool, I loved it!"" I personally liked how it repeats the names of the dinosaurs often enough for the kids to remember them.",1371168000,3,538,4.5
5450458,5,B00AMA8GMW,"Our family was able to review the Dino Dan Dino Party DVD and we loved it.  At 60 minutes total, it's about the perfect length.  Since there are multiple features in this movie, it's easy to stop at any point in between as well.  My husband liked the fact that they names of dinosaurs were repeated enough that the kids were able to retain some of them.  The kids loved watching/helping Dan celebrate his birthday and they even helped choose names for the chicks.  All in all, a great movie.  We suggest you pick it up today for your Dino fans!",1370736000,2,544,4.336633663366337
5450459,4,B00AMA8GMW,"My boys and I just finished previewing the upcoming NCircle release from the Dino Dan television series. The newest DVD is called ""Dino Party"" and has a running time of approximately 60 minutes. The DVD includes five episodes plus three bonus features. In the first episode (Chicken or the Dino), Dan tries to reunite a baby Brachiosaurus and his mother while his class focuses on coming up with a name for a baby chick that is about to hatch. The second episode (Moody Dino) has Dan trying to prove his theory that Stegosaurus' plates change color based on their feelings. In the third episode (Dino Trap), Dan tries to capture a sneaky Compsognathus before it destroys his mom's garden. The fourth episode (Dino Party) is set at Dan's birthday party where he and his friends solve clues in order to discover what dinosaur his cake is modeled after. In the fifth episode (Hard Hat, Long Neck), a Triceratops and Brachiosaurus knock down a sandcastle at the beach and end up helping to rebuild it. This DVD is great for kids who like dinosaurs, but have a shorter attention span. With each episode lasting just a little over 10 minutes, it's nice to have on hand to provide a short break from your routine. My boys enjoyed this DVD and even learned a few things!",1370649600,,1262,4.638392857142857
