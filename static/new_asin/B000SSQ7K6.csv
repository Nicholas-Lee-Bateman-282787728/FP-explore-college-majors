Nuf said.",1191196800,11,114,4.55
2889964,4,B000SSQ7K6,"I was hesitant at first to pick up Closure. In a time when American (and worldwide) theaters are flooded with mindless and disgustingly pointless torture porn, I feared it would be another one of those sleazy movies that feeds the brain-dead masses eating popcorn and slurping coke while watching someone physically tormented to death. Eventually, being a Gillian Anderson fan, I decided to give Closure a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is a violent movie (nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be though, but maybe I heard too much about it), however it at least offers some kind of reason and explanation for the brutality. The story follows Alice and her much younger lover Adam as they are viciously attacked on her way back from a party. Both emotionally and physically scarred they try to cope with the aftermath. Alice, daughter of a soldier, does not believe in turning the other cheek and wants to seek revenge, while Adam, who seems to be much younger than Alice not only in age, but also in emotional maturity, retreats into drug abuse and his co-dependency on Alice. When Alice learns the identity of their attackers, Adam and her learn what dark vengeance tastes like. The movie is not as straightforward as it may sound with some unexpected turns and in general I think it's a pretty solid piece with great acting and engaging mood.",1191024000,5,1359,4.738396624472574
2889965,4,B000SSQ7K6,I chose this movie as a free movie on my Columbia House DVD club account. I expected it to be a bad movie but it had Gillian Anderson in it and I couldn't find anything else to choose as a free movie so I got this. I actually thought it was a good movie. I'm guessing whoever wrote the script must have been a fan of the movie Deliverance. There seem to be some common points in the two films. I could have used a commentary track. You don't really get much for your money. An 80 minute film with no bonus material.,1190851200,6,515,4.009708737864078
2889966,1,B000SSQ7K6,"As a fan of the X-Files, I'll usually watch anything that David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson appear in, so I was looking forward to this movie.  What a mistake that was.  Not that Gillian Anderson was a disappointment--she was about the only good thing about this movie.  However, what the %^$# was she thinking when she agreed to appear in this crap?  Every other scene is totally implausable; the photography is so dark in most of it you can barely tell what is going on and the editing must have been done by someone with Attention Deficit Disorder.  Terrible!  There is absoultely no character development (which is a big part of why so much of it seems so implausable)and one scene jumps to another in such a disjointed way you don't even know what is going on.  I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but these seem to be a bit drawn out and, therefore, mostly gratuitous. Sadly, it seems as if director Dan Reed simply wanted every opportunity he could find to film Gillian naked and moaning. The movie is short, so there was available time that more character development could have taken place which would've helped this movie immensely. The editor should refund his/her salary.  The editing was choppy; the scenes were cut in the dumbest places, leaving the viewer wondering what had just happened.  Sadly, I really can't say enough bad things about this movie.  Danny Dyer, unknown to me before this movie, was a sleazy guy and you didn't really mind that he got beaten up.  And Gillian's character wasn't sympathetic either and had almost as much of a sleaze factor as Dyer.  Someone so seemingly successful as her character made bad decision on top of bad decision.  Again, if that character had been developed, maybe we could've known why.  Because Reed didn't explain, she just seems like a stupid, self-centered bitch who made her own trouble.  And the attacker's daughter?  What was that about?!  Oh yeah, most people anally rape the dad and then give their daughter a lift after. Dan Reed should maybe look into a different line of work because he does not seem to be very good at movie making.  Terrible waste of Gillian Anderson and a terrible waste of time for the viewer!",1190419200,4,2206,4.656330749354005
2889967,4,B000SSQ7K6,"Great directing by Dan Reed, well known for his award winning documentary movies.
In ""Closure"", he is building up a thriller from an everyday 'regular' situation. Familiar urban environments quickly become grey and monotonous in an unsettling way, people gatherings also transformed: for example, the party scene looks like it is turning into a party of shadows. Equally unsettling is the depiction of muddy and drizzly countryside (the photography is outstanding). The sounds - whistling wind, rustling leaves, characters barely talking, mostly breathing heavily and moaning or yelling and screaming. All characters (both 'good' and 'bad') are alienated from each other, they meet and interact because they happen to be in the same, mostly wrong, places. All are emotionally empty, except for the rage and desperation which give them some short-lived intentionality and purpose. Very good Anderson and Dyer.
There is no closure after watching ""Closure"". The movie could have been longer than 80 minutes to allow the (very talented) director some space to better develop some of the characters. After watching it last night I was under the immediate impression of the violence depicted, but later on I was even more struck by desolation, sadness and loneliness of the characters' condition.
This is not the movie to relax, but the movie that will make you think.",1190332800,24,1362,5.28110599078341
2889968,2,B000SSQ7K6,"I picked up this movie because I am such a fan of Gillian Anderson.
Since 'X Files' I have only seen her in 'House of Mirth', and 'The Last King of Scotland'.

Just so you're warned, 'Closure' is a violent movie. So you might not want to leave it out for the kids, or watch it say, the night before you are about to swap your apartment with someone on EBay who has a cottage in  the English countryside. Because 'Closure'is not quite like 'Holiday' with Jack Black, and Kate Winslet.

Set mostly in rual England, it is the story of a Alice Comfort (Anderson)and her date Adam, an alarm systems manager, played by Danny Dyer, who are brutally attacked on their way home from a party. Both survive, but have very different coping mechanisms. One character regresses, with a child-like dependency on the other, who has become a vigilanty avenger.

From the begining of the movie, Alice is an mysterious woman. She has a paraplegic boss who is obsessed with her, and the party she and Adam attend before the attack is so strange and subtle that I wondered for a minute if what followed was some type of set-up.

Most Hollywood movies that are extremely violent have a way of 'glazing' the violence so that I don't usually feel extremely effected by it. One example is 'The Brave One', with Jodie Foster, which I recently saw in the theater. I felt like I was watching nothing more than a graphic novel brought to life.

The climactic violence of 'Closure' takes place in farmhouse kitchen in the middle of the woods, and there was no glazed feeling. It was gritty, and it was horrible.

I loved the roll of the weather in this movie. Most of the scenes are shot outdoors in late Autumn, early Winter. Everything is cold, and dusky, and smokey. I appreciate movies where the countryside is a truly menacing presence, and one longs for the safety of the city.

Fans of 'Straw Dogs' and the French (possibly Belgian) movie 'The Ordeal' might agree. There is no DVD commentary, and  'Closure' and doesn't apoligize for the violence the characters perpetrate on each other.",1190332800,9,2064,4.602179836512262

2889976,4,B000SSQ7K6,"A disturbing violent and visceral experience. Gillian Anderson gives her performance of a life time as a rape victim who decides to seek ultimate justice. Alice is a strong willed woman. Independent and strong headed but soon her reality and her life turn upside down as an act of violence against her. This has wonderful acting performances by the whole crew starring. An eye opening performance by the young talented Danny Dyer as Adam. Adam has just met Alice and is a security alarm installer. Adam ends up falling for Alice.

Danny Dyer is brilliant in this performance and deserve a huge mention for his reality based acting and ultimate persona in this film as his character becomes a part of you and shocks and amazes you with his gifted acting quality. He was born in United Kingdom and has acted since the late 80s all the way to the present. He is a master talent at building his characters and showcasing a reality based quality to his characters. He ends up making you believe his performances and the character of Adam in this is no different. Dyer is a performer that should be showcased for any lover of cinema and the art form of acting.

I grew up watching Gillian Anderson on The X-Files. Never missed an episode in its original run. I watched the very first episode on the night it premiered. I and my family was in Myrtle Beach staying for vacation. My parents wanted to go for a walk on the beach but I made them wait until the show ended before we left. Gillian is master at her characters throughout her acting career. She is far from a one trick pony. If anything she became flawless after The X-files ended. She is such a truly gifted and brilliant lady that shines in all her glory and amazing beauty. She is a truly sexy lady. If you ever get the chance make sure you seek out the 2011 production of Great Expectations. This was a Mini-series by the BBC Productions. She played the character Miss Havisham and she owned it and deserved huge awards and it was the best of the character ever performed in the acting world. She is currently a main character on the awesome, amazing, twisted and truly disturbing and must watch and must experience TV show Hannibal. She plays Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier on the show and truly works her mysterious and brilliant ways.

Alice and Adam are brutally attacked in a wooded area after stopping to kill a deer they hit. So begins the struggle to come to terms with the reality of incident and also the ultimate anger, rage and revenge boiling inside them.

I am a huge fan when it comes to revenge seeking films. From the brilliant cult original Death Wish Series to the very underrated 2007s The Brave One to the over looked 2007s Death Sentence to the best and ultimate revenge masterpiece 1960s tour-de-force The Virgin Spring. I even enjoy the more horror induced one like 1972s The Last House on the Left, 1978s I Spit on your Grave, or even more of the odd cinematic ones like Kill Bills. I am just a fan when ultimate justice can be served when regular justice fails. I guess I am just a twisted little person but I believe that justice should be allowed.

This is a great film when the final revenge starts and the torment of the reality of taking another persons life starts to weigh on Adam. To kill someone is not an easy means and when the persona of the human side starts to play with the mind. Alice wants her revenge. Alice wants of justice. Alice needs her Closure.

2889990,3,B000SSQ7K6,"Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) and Danny Dyer (Severance) are victims of a violent crime seeking revenge, in Closure (aka Straightheads) (2007), a drama with some tense and genuinely touching moments.  Directed by Dan Reed, the story is fairly well told, and features some strong acting performances, but the film's ending leaves a bad aftertaste.  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.

Set in Britain, businesswoman Alice Comfort (Anderson) has hired Alan (Dyer) to install a security system in her home.  She asks the 23 year-old to be her escort for the evening, at a party at her boss's home in the country.  The couple are attracted to each other, and before leaving the party, they have sex in the woods.  Cruising back to town in Alice's Lexus, they encounter a slower moving SUV in front of them, and Alan honks the horn as the Lexus races by.  Down the road the couple hit an elk, and while stopped along the road they are attacked by men in the SUV.  Adam is whacked in the head, while Alice is pulled from the car, and raped on the hood.

The story jumps forward a month, and Alan has moved into Alice's apartment.  He has problems seeing out of one eye, and apparently suffers from sexual dysfunction.  Alice did not report the sexual assault, and the police have no leads who may be responsible for the attack.  Alice unexpectedly learns that her estranged father has died, and while visiting her father's house in the country, she sees one of the men that attacked her.  Coincidentally, her attacker named Heffer (Anthony Calf) lives a few miles from her father's house with his daughter Sophie (Francesca Fowler).  Together with a reluctant Alan, Alice begins to plot her revenge.  Breaking out her father's rifle, she begins practicing her shooting skills, and somehow gets hold of a silencer.

Much of what happens, like Alice and Alan being free to devote their time to this venture, Alice running into Heffer, an unlikely attempted suicide, and Sophie's mysterious appearances, are a bit too convenient.  Setting those issues aside, you have a pretty edgy, though not entirely convincing drama, that mostly keeps you guessing which way things will go.  Adam manages to get into the attacker's home and plant some surveillance cameras, but this device doesn't seem to be used as well as it could have been.  There are a few moving revelations, some radical twists, and brutal sadistic violence unexpectedly explodes.  Unfortunately the final twist leaves a bit too much unsettled and up in the air, causing what could have been an excellent movie, to rate only 3.5 stars.

Danny Dyer is pretty convincing playing a younger man, bringing believability, frustration, and sensitivity to his performance.  Gillian Anderson is very good, in an emotionally stressful and challenging role, going from victim to vigilante.  You feel her pain when she is ravaged, and understand her desire for revenge.  While at the end Alice may have reached ""closure"", she also seems to have unleashed a demon.",1315353600,,3014,4.91106719367589
2889991,5,B000SSQ7K6,"Right, so, I had this movie delivered via Netflix but didn't watch it.  I was one, afraid of the rape scene and two, everyone said it was a horrid movie.  I am a huge Gillian Anderson fan due to X-files so my curiosity got the better of me.  I have never seen her in anything else.  The reason I gave this 5 stars instead of three or two is because of several factors.  The first being, drink a bottle of wine while watching this movie.  Actually, drink the first glass before the movie, drink the second by the 30 minute mark and drink the third glass by the 70 minute mark.  Then understand these two things.  First, the guy who plays Adam is a horrible actor and consequently, a huge douche.  Second, whoever is the editor should not only be fired but should never ever see film again.  Gillian Anderson did what she could with a questionable script and made this film worth watching.  She should be up for an Oscar is there was a category, ""I had to float this film.""  Last, but not least, to give this film a five star rating it does help to be drunk off of said bottle of wine.",1301443200,,1083,4.203883495145631
2889992,4,B000SSQ7K6,"I gave it 4 stars only because the ending wasn't really one but Gillian Anderson-(GA)-is incredible in this. Its not an easy thing to see, not at all but its a good film. Not for kids at all!!! Even adults may have trouble but its still a good movie and worth seeing!",1295827200,,267,4.153846153846154
2889993,5,B000SSQ7K6,"This movie was a suprise.  Gillian Anderson looks stunningly sexy and remarkably real.  This alone is worth the watching of this movie; but plus you get to see her speak with her English accent which is quite interesing in itself.  Sidenote: I thought it very strange sychronicity that I was listening to a talk show minutes before about people hitting deer on the road and then this movie had the same thing in it.

This movie is very different, dark, real, it has a strange intuitive feel.  I think it expects it's audience to be smart.  There are things that are left vague, you have to sorta intuitively feel what is going on.  Yet no question there are many suprises as well.  Gillian Anderson is really great - she is believable.  You see her in a new totally different light, extremely sexy, dominant, and she still is a pro when she uses a weapon as in X-Files.  If you are used to her persona (Dana Scully - which I love) this is much different but equally as powerful and impacting.

I don't want to go into what the movie is about but it's not what I expected nor even knew where it was going.  I wouldn't mind if the director gave us a Closure part 2 - it would be very interesting indeed to see where the next film would take us, as interesting as how this film leaves us.  Just make sure you get all the original characters for part 2 if you do it.

If you like Gillian Anderson I can't imagine you not enjoying this film, seeing her sexier than ever is worth it alone but you also see her in a more vulnerable way than her character on X-Files.

I give it 5 stars for it's uniqueness and realistic acting and scenarios.  Remember it's a smart film but also very intuitive - telling you things but not everything.  You have to feel it out.  It plays very real - in the fact that it's strange, like life.  It stirs up emotions within you and what it stirs up stays with you as you wonder about the characters and how things will end.  It's a nice looking film.  I like that it has silence in it.  Sometimes silence says more than dialogue or music.

Now don't get me wrong that this is a masterpiece, it is not - but it is something very special and stands out.  I give it 5 stars for it's ability to be so entirely different and unexpected and that is able to draw you in emotionally and visually.  I find the length of the film perfect, if it was any shorter it would be not enough to understand it - and any longer, it would lose it's impact.  The length of this film was superbly executed.  I want more when it's over.  I want to know more.  About what happens afterward, the characters, the dynamic of the people and the relationships.  How the characters feel after everything.

I think this is the sexiest I've seen Gillian Anderson in a film.  Which is also a huge plus.  And believe me she is sexy and looks very classy.  But it's the fact she seems so genuinely English (she did live there when younger) that it is like looking at a different person.

The premise of the movie is strange.  This movie is strange, and interesting and leaves you with a strangeness.  It makes you wonder what you'd do in such strange circumstances.  You just have got to see it.  I thought at first to give it 3 stars but when I rewatched parts and as time went by I could see this movie impacted me deeper than I first suspected.  Again, it made me realize that the director is hoping you can sort out certain things on your own.  Connect dots - make connections, he doesn't explain everything for you in black and white.  And any movie that can make you want to watch it again and study the characters so much to me deserves a good rating, but also the way it is presented, is quite good and clever.  It leaves you in the role to be a silent observer, just watching; but yet feeling the characters.  He lets you get into their head, but only so much.  I really don't know what more to say except if you are a fan of Gillian Anderson I think you will be genuinely suprised at her beauty, her depth, and the chemistry between her and the main actor who is strange but likable himself.  It's because of this different dynamic that makes it even more interesting.

This is one of the most likeable strange movies I have ever seen.  Strange being very good here.  Very good indeed.  Strange being another very operative word here.  Positively so.  Also this is not for children, it is a very adult film.  This movie just keeps haunting me, and that is why I give it 5 stars, everyone in the movie is effective.  I really think they should make a part 2 if they can come up with an interesting story - I would definitiely see it.  It could develop the characters a bit more and give us more insight.  For in this film we must use our heads and intuition to come up with some answers.  Repeated views make things stronger.

The director has made a very unique film that just seems to stay on your mind.  Worth a watch, a few times - especially late at night with the lights out and silence all around you.  It reminds me of autumn energy which has that mystery with it.  Other people write they wonder why Gillian Anderson might have made this movie - I can say because it is impacting, she looks extremely sexy and fun, she looks equally vulnerable and angry as well as smart.  Her co-star plays his role wonderfully.  It's a shocking film that impacts and haunts especially if you watch it a few times.  Also it has the potential for another sequel that I WOULD LOVE TO SEE.  Why - because I don't have total closure myself yet.  I want more closure.

I will be hoping for Closure 2.

Of course, the primary reason a lot of people will want to see this film is to see Gillian Anderson topless.  I admit I fall into this camp, and that alone warrants the cost of the DVD.  That said, it's also a pretty good movie in its own right - IF you're into sadistic dramas.",1258675200,4,1523,5.545454545454546
2889999,2,B000SSQ7K6,"This movie is an unconvincing descent into gratuitous violence redeemed only by an excellent performance from Gillian Anderson. Although the desire for revenge is an understandable response to the brutality suffered by the two main characters their reaction is not a credible one. Few people act on an urge for vengeance but even if we accept that they do on this occasion it's hard to believe they would be this extreme. What is this movie trying to tell us about a lust for violence? Well, nothing really, except that some people have such a lust. Now, I like a good gory horror flick, but in such films the violence is not posited as real. Here, however, we're supposed to accept these sadistic acts of retaliation as plausible, and we're left feeling a little grubby for having witnessed them.",1254614400,,797,4.782608695652174
2890000,2,B000SSQ7K6,"I am not really sure where to begin with this movie, so I will open the floor with why I watched this film in the first place.  I watched ""Closure"" for two reasons.  The first is because I am a fan of Gillian Anderson.  Like many people I was introduced by Gillian Anderson when she played Dana Scully on the classic television show ""The X-Files"".  I have managed to see in her several other things throughout the years and I believe she is a fine actress.  The second reason I watched this movie is that it was recommended by a friend of mine, who said this movie was wrong on many different levels.

Going into this movie I wasn't expecting a ""mainstream"" or ""Hollywood"" type film. In addition, I had already expected a bit of an exploitation film, due to the ""rape and revenge"" nature of the content. I also knew that this film was released in the UK under the title ""Straightheads"" not ""Closure"".  After watching this movie, I don't think the former or latter title really fits the substances of the film.  The one thing I know for certain, I was very disappointed when this motion picture was over.

The plot is a bit implausible, yet simplistic; Alice (Gillian Anderson) is a classy business woman who is having a home security system installed.  The person installing the security system is Adam (Danny Dyer).  Due to some subtle sexual attraction, Alice invites Adam to be her date to her boss' birthday party.  At this point I raise my eyebrow at bit, but I guess this could happen.

At the party Adam is out of place, more than likely due to the fact he is much younger than Alice.  This doesn't stop Alice and Adam to leave the party to have sex in the woods.  At this point I raise my other eyebrow, but there is such thing as bohemian lust.  On the way home from the party, Alice and Adam are driving and then ran off the road by another car.  Three men get out of the car and approach Alice and Adam.  At this point Adam is severely accosted and Alice brutally ganged raped.

We now fast forward a month later and it appears that Adam is now living with Alice. They have both been traumatized from the attack; Adam is now reduced to wearing an eye patch. Adam is also a bit ""all over the place"" he is wayfaring through myriad emotions and is now impotent.  Alice has become very aloof and somewhat cold.  Her focus becomes vengeance.  This leads Alice and Adam to go after their attackers. There is a bit more to it, but not much and if a person has the desire to watch this film, I don't want to ruin it for them.

The major problem I had with this movie was the character of Adam.  I am not sure what Danny Dyer was trying to do with this individual.  The wishy-washy nature of his character only vexed me; it didn't make me feel sympathetic for him.  Maybe this was the filmmakers' goal.  I also didn't see how a character that was this unstable would be still hanging around a woman he hardly knew.  I understand that there is an element of misattribution of emotion (the rape/attack) that they both went through.  In contrast, I don't see a professional business woman taking in an unstable person, who she shares no history prior to this tragic attack.  Yet maybe this duplicity was the filmmakers' goal.

The first half of the movie was pretty good.  It appeared that there would be some element of revenge or dare I say ""closure"".  Then everything falls apart at the half way point of the movie.  The film is only about 80 minutes, so after the first 40 minutes I felt everything began to crumble.  It appears that half way through the movie, the filmmakers decided to make this story ""deeper"" and the ""villains"" more complex.  This ruse was a shoddy attempt to make this movie something that it wasn't.  When the credits rolled I was like ""wow, I can't believe I spent money on this movie"".

In contrast, Gillian Anderson's performance was amazing.  Her British accent was awesome and I did care what happen to her character.  She was also extremely sexy and stylish in this movie.  I was also not expecting to she her unclad in this movie.  So I guess that is a bonus.  However, I don't like to gauge a movie on its amount of T&A, if that were the cause all porno movies would be Oscar winners.  Her performance and some of the scenery in this movie is the ONLY reason I am giving this movie two stars.

This movie had so much potential and it could have really been a great film.  This ""rape and revenge"" genre isn't anything new, remember ""I Spit on Your Grave""?  However, this movie fails terribly.  Not because it isn't ""I Spit on Your Grave"", but because the movie starts off strong and then gets flat. There was mood that this movie had, very eerie and haunting.  Consequently, the mood is totally divorced by misdirection, loop holes in plot and too many incredulous factors. Not to mention Danny Dyer's performance is embarrassing.  I'm done, no more blaming statements.

In conclusion, there is an interesting scene in ""Closure"" involving sodomy with a rifle.  I can relate to this scene quite a bit.  For this scene is when I realized I sodomized out of the time and money I had put into this movie.  Now I need to have a long conversation with this friend of mine......",1252454400,,5204,4.439281942977825

2890005,2,B000SSQ7K6,"Straightheads (Dan Reed, 2007)

Despite something of a weak beginning, I have to say that for the first hour, Straightheads (released in the US as Closure) struck me as the kind of movie I'm always looking for, an overlooked, underrated gem that people didn't get simply because most people who go to movies seem to almost pathologically avoid overthinking them. It had everything a smart, low-key psychological thriller needs. Then it all went to pot in the space of two or three minutes; another could-have-been great film that ended up mediocre.

It starts off with what might be the least realistic opening scene in filmdom: an executive named Alice (Gillian Anderson), who's getting a security system installed in her swanky house, decides on a whim to ask Adam (Danny Dyer), the guy installing the system, to go to a big work do with her. I don't say unrealistic because of the situation; I say unrealistic because, well, it's GILLIAN ANDERSON. Why does she need to go hitting on security system installers when she could have me? But I digress. In any case, big party, driving home, car accident, very bad things happen with the locals. Cue big revenge drama, like Straw Dogs, but with the roles reversed-- Alice is the one hell-bent on making the bastards pay, while Adam, who lost an eye in the attack, is counseling moderation. Just when the two of them are ready to carry out Alice's dastardly plan, however, a monkeywrench is thrown into the works: the guy they're after has a daughter, Sophie (Francesca Fowler). Alice switches gears: she'll save the daughter before offing the father. This is not where the movie goes downhill (surprisingly), but this is where the setup for the implosion begins. By the time we get to the big climax-- which, as it turns out, is not big at all (it has the same anticlimactic feel as Straw Dogs, which I will keep referencing in this review until everyone's mad at me, but without anywhere near as much violence)-- we're entirely uncertain what's going on. There's a good deal of psychological trickery at play, but where any of it's going to lead is anyone's guess. Normally, that's a good thing. Here, it isn't.

This made the Times' (London, not New York) 100 Best Films of 2007. Over Zodiac, no less, or even such lesser, but still not bad, lights as 1408. And I'll give you that for the first forty-five minutes or thereabouts, this really does have the quiet-thriller-that-blows-up-in-your-face feel to it, and I was completely ready to go wherever it took me. Then it started playing with what I can only assume was supposed to be ambiguity, and, well, things went downhill fast. I must admit, though, it was certainly nice to see that much of Gillian Anderson (who COULD'VE HAD ME!) for the first time since The Turning, and that may be enough to convince Anderson fans to give it a go; too bad the last half hour of the film doesn't hold up. **",1216339200,3,2900,4.715976331360947
2890006,2,B000SSQ7K6,"This movie runs pretty close to violent classics like, I Spit On Your Grave.  While Gillian Anderson plays her role well, as a tough-minded, good-looking business woman, the story is too graphic for my taste.  The basic premise is that Anderson is a successful business woman who picks up a younger man and takes him to a party.  Some of the scenes really seemed unnecessary, like a guy in a wheel chair, at the party coming on to her, her having sex on the lawn with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cranking himself when alone.

On their way home from the party, a truck full of drugged up men brutalize the couple.  Anderson is brutally raped and her boy toy is severly beaten.  She quickly sets up in a cabin which just happens to be easy access to the home of one of the rapists.  With a silenced rifle she looks for targets and sends her boyfriend on errands, like retrieving a dead dog and installing a movie camera inside of the rapist's home.  This dude plays her little helper monkey without taking any initiative on his own.  They catch one of the rapists and violate him in a gruesome fashion.  I had to fast forward through this movie hopeing that it would make some kind of sense.  While it might appeal to people who want to see a hard revenge flick, I found it hard to watch.

2890007,1,B000SSQ7K6,This movie was a total disappointment. I rented it because I am a Gillian Anderson fan and usually whatever she is in her acting makes it incredible but in this even her talent could not carry it. The script was horribly written and the leading man made you want to shot him. The script was very choppy and seemed forced into trying to carry a plot line. God willing X Files 2 will be worthy of her talent. If your curiosity still gnaws at you please rent it first before you waste your money purchasing it.,1208476800,2,507,4.291666666666667
2890008,4,B000SSQ7K6,"Gillian Anderson is becoming more beautiful and interesting as she gets older. The round-faced freshess of her X-Files days is gone, replaced by a sleek steeliness. And in this film she's 180-degrees different from her X-Files character, and for us that's a very good thing, because we see a performance that's tough--aggressive, even--unnerving (and that's even before she and her date are viciously attacked), and yet still vulnerable. Much is communicated through facial expressions and body language, not dialog. Danny Dyer's Adam is a perfect foil to her toughness, being basically a big kid at 23 with a low-paying job and a general innocence and decency that he holds onto through most of the film. The circumstances presented in the film are really just opportunities to explore the characters, as they both deal with the aftermath of brutality in different ways, shifting toward and away from each other, phasing between power and powerlessness, outrage and fear, conscience and brutality--sometimes all within the same scene. In this film what's gripping is less the plot (although there are a couple of nice twists at the end) than the character study of two people whose already-empty lives literally implode and the choices they make in the aftermath. Every moment Anderson and Dyer are on screen is riveting.

2890012,3,B000SSQ7K6,"Somewhere in here was a very good movie trying to get out. For me its probably between 3 and 4 stars. The fact that its never really very good doesn't mean to say you shouldn't watch it. The script whilst it has a lot of flaws and some gaping plot holes is basically a nice little twist on the standard revenge movie (think Straw Dogs). Some previous reviewers have been quite harsh in their criticism, but my feeling is that it actually reflects human nature rather well. I.e. different people will react differently if they have been the subject of a violent attack.

The cast all give decent performances with Gillian Anderson undoubtably the best actor in the film. However the big problem with the film is its lack of sympathetic characters. In the end you just don't care what happens to anybody.

I'm grateful that some British films are still being made though. There is a lot worse than this coming out of Hollywood! So overall I only recommend buying if its very cheap, as it maybe worth seeing once, but I don't know how it will stand up to repeated viewings.",1199059200,3,1070,4.538860103626943
2890013,4,B000SSQ7K6,"I disagree with the opinions of many of the reviewers of this movie; it is better than their two-star rating would imply. Yes, there are weaknesses: background on the characters, particularly the character played by Gillian Anderson and the two most agressive attackers, was sorely lacking. The ability to travel miles through the forest on foot in mere seconds stretched credibility, and personality reversals seemed to occur frequently and with indistinct motivation. Was the daughter actually being molested by her father's associates, or was it merely a possibility? What's up with the abrupt ending? etc...etc...

Despite the shortcomings, many scenes and situations were quite engaging. Anderson's character radiated an intense sexuality and her casual seduction of the security system tech was quite credible. I doubt that the ""relationship"" would have lasted long without the brutal interlude on their way home from the party, but once forced together by their shared horror and injury, the increasing pathology of their relationship becomes riveting. The gender reversal is a nice touch: she becomes stronger, dominant, and more bent on revenge; he shies away from violence, weak, damaged, and literally impotent.

Eventually, this reversal is reversed, albeit without full justification in my opinion. Her desire for revenge is quickly sated, far short of what was originally planned, while his accelerates dramatically. Another paradox is presented by the rapist/father: he claims to have only raped the Anderson character to distract his cronies from raping his daughter, but he did so with a level of brutality that does not seem consistent with a ""fatherly"" figure. Then, this brutal rapist/concerned father suffers remorse that leads him to attempt suicide, which will leave his daughter at the mercy of the men from whom he originally sought to protect her. Illogical, but an interesting sequence of events.

Likewise, the abrupt ending. At first I was shocked and disappointed, then I realized that nothing more could have been said or done. Any subsequent plot or dialog would have diminished the power of what occurred.

The mere fact that I felt compelled to spend time analyzing the motivation for these plot and character twists supports my personal conviction that there are moments of high quality in this production. When a movie is entirely bad, there is absolutely no compulsion for analysis. I admit that flaws and contradictions exist in this production, but like a stew made from things of varying appeal...in my opinion, there is enough here to justify the meal.

One final note: I agree with one reviewer in questioning the origination of the idea voiced repeatedly in reviews that the rapist/attackers were ""hunters"". It is clearly stated in the movie that the three men were out drinking and returning home. Hunting was never mentioned.",1198886400,27,2870,5.298901098901099
2890014,1,B000SSQ7K6,"I see some people are giving this movie decent reviews because they like Gillian Anderson. She is probably it's only redeeming quality. Everything about it is truly bad. The story revolves around an older woman and a younger man whose relationship is even more shallow than their character development (which is non-existent). Brutalized, traumatized, seeking revenge, that's about it. There isn't much more to say about it. I guess if you want to see Gillian Anderson take her clothes off, you might like it. But it certainly isn't worth the price of admission, although she did prove her talent regarding various forms of moaning, grunting, and screaming. She's a much better actress with her clothes on.

And what's with this ""brutalized by a group of hunters"" nonsense? What makes them hunters? Just because they were driving a Land Rover? How many people living in the countryside there drive Land Rovers? Every time we see the three bad guys, it's the same thing: one guy is wearing casual clothes, another one is wearing everyday street clothes and hobbling around with a cane, and the third one is wearing slacks and a jacket. None of them are ever dressed for hunting. And not only are they never shown in the act of hunting, but they are never even seen discussing it, nor are they ever seen carrying a rifle or shotgun. But for some unexplained reason, these three dweebs who always look like they just got home from another day at work are supposed to be hunters? Uh... okay, whatever. When I figure that one out, I'll get back to you.

The story jumps from scene to scene in a very choppy manner, and it ends abruptly while leaving you with the feeling that the last ten or fifteen minutes that wrapped up the story were for some reason left on the cutting room floor. Obviously, the film was made that way (with one of the central characters walking up and staring into the camera? Please, how cheesy can you get?), but the whole thing was just poorly executed and leaves the viewer hanging. It seems to be nothing more than an exercise in trauma and horror for the sake of... trauma and horror. I really can't think of any other point behind this movie.

I can't believe Gillian Anderson is actually in a movie this bad. She must be getting desperate for work since the X-Files ended.

to bare more than her soul. Much of the drearyness of the film is probably due to the shooting location. They should have shot it in the Bahamas.",1193097600,2,617,4.609090909090909

The last movie she co-starred in was The Last King Of Scotland even if it was small part it was good to see that she is still acting.

Closure which probably opened in the UK but went straight to DVD in the states isn't a bad movie. It's brutal,sexual,masturbation,violent rape scene (not as much as the cult classic ""I Spit On Your Grave"")and focuses on one woman's quest for revenge and her male (boy toy) going from a scared weakling and finding himself.

This movie is borderline X-rated,so it's not a family movie or even along the lines of Death Wish or The Brave One. It's very sadistic,you don't get to bond with the characters and I don't think you would want to.

The ending will sure enough be a big surprise.

If you looking for a Death Wish than this in NOT the movie for you,better movie in this catergory is ""I Spit On You're Grave"".Brutal but you understood why the character did what she had to do.

With this movie you kind of wish they had called the authorities and made more like Jodie Foster's ""The Accused"".

If you're a Gillian Anderson fan it's a watch but not if you are looking for the innocent Gillian Anderson than skip it,her character will make you throw up. The last time she did a movie with a tad of nudity was her first movie ""The Turning"".This is a 360 degree turn compared to that one.
