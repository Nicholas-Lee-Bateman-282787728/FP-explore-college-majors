1925375,5,B0000DIJNU,"This movie has to be one of the most inspiering, and beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. The imagry and simbalizom alone, were enoff to take my breath away, add that to an amazing cast and script you have your self this 5 star flick. This is a spctauler film and moveing story. I would recomend it to anyone, espshaly if they have siblings.",1076198400,7,348,4.287878787878788
1925376,5,B0000DIJNU,"As a huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland this movie knocked me off my feet.  The characters were so wonderfully portrayed by the actors that you could have knocked me over with a feather.  I am used to Kiefer being a bad guy, being a good guy, but this one ranks as his best movie to date.
Definitely hangs with 24.

1925377,5,B0000DIJNU,"First, this is a superb script. It searches the deepest emotional corners of life with crystalline clarity.  There is depth of emotion without sentiment, spiritual exploration without cliche and human truth devoid of lecturing.  In addition, this writer and director were truly fortunate in their cast.  The characters are extraordinarly realized and executed. It takes trained, talented and caring actors to so succesfully inhabit their roles. But their way was certainly smoothed by the heartbreaking intensity and utter integrity of the story.
The locations are almost painfully beautiful and the editing and direction produce an utterly seamless experience.
Finally, this not a story about death; it's about living life -- and that is it's greatest acheivement.",1068768000,33,765,5.577586206896552
1925378,5,B0000DIJNU,"Considering the typical role of Kiefer Sutherland, this film is quite out of the ordinary.  The performances by two incredible actors bring alive the story of man who is fighting his own fears, while trying to help his sister fight hers as well.  They help each other to accept certain tragedies in their lives, his illness, her denial of their mother's murder, and rebuild a relationship with each other that is incredibly real.  This film is poignant, brilliant and touching to say the least, and has an incredible message concerning HIV/AIDS, but also a touch of humor.  Kiefer's gestures, facial expressions and his portrayal of this man with the rough exterior who has such a kind heart show that he's beyond talent.  The scene on the beach where Roy and Natalie have their conversation about being alone is fantastically done, and the scene near the end when he tells her he loves her is so simple, yet so touching.  It faces the finality of death, and shows the importance of family and forgiveness, in a masterful production that I watch over and over again.  We need to see more of this type of film from Mr. Sutherland.",1067990400,46,1129,4.700507614213198
1925379,5,B0000DIJNU,"Behind the Red Door is a lovely and poignant movie.  Keifer
Sutherland is excellent as the brother.  Watch his walk! So
in character!  This man never disappoints.
His dry wit and perfect timing are a delight.
This movie was based on a true story and it is apparent that
real care and talented people were behind the making of the movie.
The sister in the movie is excellent.  The mood and tone of
the story is so good, you hate it when the ending comes.
The scenery adds even more to the nuances of the film as well
as the excellently researched medical background.
This is the ""gem of a movie we are all looking for.""",1067558400,2,618,4.301724137931035
1925380,5,B0000DIJNU,This movie was such a surprise to me. Many great performances and the subject matter was handled with such grace and dignity. I love it. It is now on of my all time favorites. I will be watching this movie over and over again.,1398643200,,226,4.159090909090909

1925382,4,B0000DIJNU,"There is no doubt that from the very start of this movie you know how it will end.  Not only will you know how it will end, but you can just state out loud what the next stereo-typical plot twist or deviation will be and whom is who's brother or sister or father. Who will die a horrible death, etc.  It is so ""hallmark/Lifetime"" in its predictability that it borders on sappy. The acting leaves less than can be desired. All three main characters try hard, very hard, to get through this script as best they can. Sutherland trying to play bitchy and somewhat effeminate gay man is painful to watch. The script for Channing is almost beneath her talents and she too is painful to watch..and Sedgewick is just painful.  So why did I give this four stars? The cinematography is breath taking. Not just the locale, but the pristine sharp focus of the lens and the the somber setting makes you become part of the movie. I have never watched any film where I truly felt I was there, I was in the scene and not because of the emotions pouring from the actors, there is no emoting, it is clearly the cinematography.  The colors of autumn, even in summer, are pronounced and vibrant..this feel/look follows the film from start to the very end. The first time I viewed it on Showtime I was taken back by the photography...it was only later upon watching it a second time did I realize just how awful and predictable was the story line.",1370476800,,1426,4.431297709923665
1925383,5,B0000DIJNU,My original copy was ruined so I HAD to replace it.  This movie is intense and moving.  Watching Keifer as a gay man is a hoot! I really like all the actors in this movie,1369180800,,170,3.8285714285714287

1925385,5,B0000DIJNU,"One reviewer said there was a problem with the aspect ratio. This DVD was not made for TV. I worked on the film and it was made for movie theaters. The film was made in Canada and sometimes things are prepared differently than the US depending on the company.
Keifer did an amazing job in this movie. I believe it is his best role.",1350950400,,331,4.1875
1925386,3,B0000DIJNU,"The subject matter and acting is fine.

The DVD itself is an example of a problem occasionally seen with DVDs of films made for TV.  None of the choices of aspect ratio on my wide-screen HD TV are correct.

This is similar to the usual problem of a hotel room with a wide-screen TV connected to a standard-definition cable service subscription; the hotel remote control offers no way to change the aspect ratio.  I think of it as the ""fat-head"" syndrome.",1348531200,,454,4.567901234567901
1925387,5,B0000DIJNU,"I enjoyed this movie so much. I love all three of leads in this movie. Kiefer Sutherland is my favorite male actor because he is so fine to look at and portrays his characters so well.

1925388,4,B0000DIJNU,"We never can be sure what happened in the past, but we get to focus on the present, with a brother dying of AIDS and his sister taking care of him.  That he has a bad attitude and hasn't seen her in years adds to the drama and to the sense of time together slipping away. Great performances by Sedgwick and Sutherland.",1326758400,,318,4.129032258064516
1925389,5,B0000DIJNU,"This movie was a lovely surprise for me. I commend Showtime for producing character-driven, grown-up movies like this, and Behind the Red Door was no disappointment.  I really love it when an actor completely defies an iconic role the way Kiefer Sutherland does in this movie.  Others have mentioned his subtle expressions, but what struck me was the clipped, almost affected way of speaking - just one of the many barriers this character put up between himself and the world.  I found myself rewinding to replay some of his sarcastic, wry remarks.  I had not seen Kyra Sedgwick in too many things (not a fan of The Closer), so I had no preconceptions about her.  Her character was so multilayered and real, and her struggle to understand what happened to her mother was like an open wound.  I loved her reactions, especially her temper tantrum outside after being attacked for her bad cooking.

I think a previous reviewer completely missed the point about the mother's death.  It was not about resolving a murder mystery (as a lesser film might have attempted), but about Natalie's coming to grips with the event.  Her comment to Roy, which I won't spoil here, about ""knowing,"" and his agreement, summed that up nicely.

I loved that the film wasn't preachy about AIDS or about being gay.  It was just this beautiful story about how life gets stripped down to the things that really matter, and all pretenses and masks fall away, when you know you only have so much time to put things in order.  It wasn't sentimental or sappy or contrived or cliched.  I felt like I knew these characters by the end of the film, and I had grown to like them as well.  I absolutely will watch this movie again and again.  I highly recommend it.",1263945600,,1729,4.641447368421052
1925390,5,B0000DIJNU,"This film was recommended to me by some members on the 24 fan site.  I had never heard of it and was curious to see how Kiefer would pull off playing a gay man. His portral is priceless to say the least. ""Roy"" is very rich, very selfish and very sick. First contact with his astranged sister is difficult for both of them.  This is a fantastic portrayal of a brother and sister who have loved and needed each other, then hated each other, then work their way back again.  The commentaries on the disc are revealing and personal.  I'm very glad to have spent the money on this film.",1246665600,,581,4.254545454545455
1925391,5,B0000DIJNU,"Great storyline.
Great acting by Kyra Sedgwick and Keifer Sutherland.
Highly recommend this movie.",1243814400,,98,6.071428571428571
1925392,5,B0000DIJNU,The story line holds my attention to the end.  And what a bittersweet end it is... Great acting by Kiefer and Kyra Sedgwick.,1209686400,,124,4.391304347826087
1925393,1,B0000DIJNU,"Pauline Kael famously barbed that she might have been able to conjure empathethic tears for Bette Davis in DARK VICTORY if it weren't for the fact that the terminally ill Judith so nobly surrendered up such a posh-elegant life in such a posh-elegant setting.  In kind, the terminally ill protagonist of BEHIND THE RED DOOR collapses in a bathroom the size of an enviably vast studio apartment--posh-elgant gold faucets and all.  If ya gotta go, then die young, pretty, and rich.

The positive components of this movie are the cinematography of beautiful landscapes on diamond-sharp film stock, Kiefer Sutherland channeling his real-life father's best acting tics, and ... well, that's about it.

Stockard Channing looks young and attractive and not over-the-top brassy in the Audrey Meadows/ Eve Arden role of tough best friend, and the rest of a capable cast at times raise their paper-thin characters to two-dimensionality.

But the negatives include a self-serving screenplay, a muddled Daddy Dearest subplot that spins its wheels in redundant but non-advancing flashbacks and is not adequately resolved, and a heroine continually playing second banana to her own Medusan hairdo--the worst cocker spaniel coif since Daryl Hannah's flat curls in the drab remake of REAR WINDOW.

""No one really wants to be alone,"" a dying man intones somberly, though it's likely that ANYONE would prefer dying alone rather than be subjected to the nearly psychotic, solipsistic drivel this poor soul must endure in the climactic deathbed scene.

A major flaw in the script misses what might have been a moment of genuine interest.  When the heroine is splashed with contaminated blood, she assures the doctor that she's safe because she has no open cuts.  But in the first scene of the movie she stabs her own finger at the mere hint of her brother's existence.  The self-stabbing was intended only as a a ""visual"" externalization, a disturbed sibling's metaphor rather than an actual aspect of a sustained character over the arc of a coherent plot.  Convenient for the exposition but too complicated for the film's ""third act,"" so we're expected to accept the sister's short-term lapse of memory:  this is the kind of pretty-suffering movie where an audience's short-term memory is expected, demanded, and a blessing.

Sutherland plays ""Roy,"" a man of limitless wealth, whose sister's principles keep her poor but pure.  By movie's end, as each breath brings him closer toward death, Roy morphs from egotistical tyrant into a beatified saint spouting sputums of precious wisdom, while the script transforms Sis into self-satisfied Rod McKuen greeting card.  Should we be surprised to learn that the film was produced, written, and directed by a woman whose now deceased brother's name was ... Roy?

Evidently the real-life Roy bequeathed his real-life limitless wealth to his real-life sister, enabling her to make this visually stunning but egocentricly shallow fortune cookie of a movie.

Real-life Roy's real-life sister was so real-life wealthy and nobly grieving, it appears, that she defied anyone else associated with the production to cool her jets and make the tribute to her brother she hoped but failed to achieve.",1202774400,,3212,5.1937984496124034
1925394,5,B0000DIJNU,very good-i could relate to the movie because i was told i only had less than a year to live when i had cancer. you really do focus on what needs to be done in the moment and not what should be done in the future. very powerful message-i believe in a person's right to choose when to die.,1192579200,,288,3.8983050847457625
1925395,3,B0000DIJNU,"Kiefer Sutherland's credible acting as Roy, rich, successful businessman is the reason you should see this little-known film. For his next project Roy, acid-tongued perfectionist, hires a photographer Natalie (Kyra Sedgwick), who happens to be his long estranged sister. We soon realize that Roy actually called in his sister for another reason - he knows he is sick.

""Behind the Red Door"" tells the story of their reconciliation as well as their traumatic childhood in the film's black-and-white flashback sequences. Stockard Channing also appears as Natalie's agent, but the time and role allotted to her is too short and small.

Kiefer Sutherland superbly deals with the vulnerable side of cynical Roy, who must accept the inevitable facts. Kyra Sedgwick is also very good as his sister, who cannot leave her annoying brother even after displaying her animosities right in front of him. Each scene including both actors has a ring of truth, something that many people would find in their personal experiences.

However, I for one found the flashbacks about the murder of their mother unnecessary. The saddest event that must have affected the lives of the children needs more detailed descriptions, but the back story about the death of their mother remains too vague to convince us of the impact upon Roy and Natalie, whose memories, it is suggested still haunt her present life.

The dramatic power of ""Behind the Red Door"" comes largely from the talented stars whose effective acting makes the otherwise ordinary film's scenes very memorable.",1176422400,,1549,5.184
1925396,5,B0000DIJNU,"This movie absolutely took me by surprise.  I wasn't expecting much as I have seen some of Kiefer Sutherland's earlier movies and wasn't impressed at all by the story content or his acting.  With that said.... I have to say I was absolutely stunned at the power of his portrayal of Roy Hadad.  I found myself forgetting that it was Kiefer playing a role, but instead found myself empathizing with Roy and taking great joy in the relationship he was beginning to re-form with his sister Natalie on an adult level.  I could truly feel Roy's vulnerabilities and fears through Kiefer's interpretation of him.  I also am not ashamed to admit that I rented this movie multiple times before I bought it.  The only thing that mars the beauty of this story is the use of a very strong curse word used multiple times by different actors.  I wish it wasn't there and it really serves no purpose being there.  It truly detracts from the pure beauty of the film.  The serenity of the ocean coupled with Kiefer's very subtle facial expressions and movements when he makes his decision on the deck and when he tells Natalie of this decision (I won't ruin it for those who have not seen it) overwhelmed me.  I truly felt the power of his conviction and the sense of purpose Roy must have felt at that time, and this was once again all due to Kiefer's portrayal of Roy.  Kiefer also portrays Roy's lifestyle in a way that is understated so that this is not the focus of the film but keeps the focus on the relationships and Roy finding for himself peace with God and others.  This movie is pure genius on the part of Kiefer Sutherland and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie with depth.  I look forward to more truly amazing performances by Kiefer Sutherland in the future.  Kiefer, if you're out there let me say that no actor has ever moved me the way you did in this movie.  Thank you for the experience.",1150848000,16,1916,4.4498567335243555

1925398,5,B0000DIJNU," must see movie for people with substanance.  Emotional healing is a long and painful process.  Roy painting the front door of his house a bright red colour is just one of the visual healing processes.  The nature scenery is so beautiful I wish I could see, feel and hear the surroundings of the house and the house itself.  Both actors delivered brilliant performances, and I don't understand why the movie and the actors didn't receive an Oscar or Golden Globe!",1138320000,8,463,4.7375
1925399,5,B0000DIJNU,"I rented this film before I bought it.  I must say that this is Kiefer's absolutate ""best"" performance.  I rented it for 3 straight weeks and then bought it.  I watch it over and over again.  The story was so sensitively told and the cast was absolutely perfect!!!!  Kiefer of course was the solid anchor and Kyra brought in the rear w/her solid portrayal.  I loved the actress who played Michelle as well, she was a delight.  I also particularly took notice of the actress who played the young Natalie.  I am expecting more from this young lady and look forward to seeing her in future projects.

But, back to the story.  My heart was touched and I found that ""I"" wanted to go help Roy myself.  That's just how profound Kiefer's portrayal is!!!!  It seemed like I was watching my own loved on going through this situation.  Though I have enjoyed everything I've seen Kiefer do, this is, again, his absolute ""best"" work.  And now with his success on 24, there's no stopping him now!!!!

I highly recommend this film.  You will see a most sensitive story told in the absolute finest form, superb peformances and you will experience Kiefer ""at his best!!!""

You go Kiefer!!!!  May God continue to bless you!!!!",1117324800,9,1208,4.591549295774648

8001154,4,B0000DIJNU,"I agree with the many positive judgments that have been made about this film but I found the setting very distracting.  Being very

familiar with the east coast I was constantly wondering just where the movie was supposed to be taking place which made understanding the plot

extra difficult.  It sure did not look like Massachusetts nor even anywhere in New England. Had the writer ever even been to the  east coast?

And what man of taste could live in such a dark and hideous house?

The dispersing of Roy's ashes was also bungled.  Where was the directer?",1464307200,,559,4.63265306122449

I started with 24 when I made it to Kiefer Sutherland & watching how well he portrayed that character made me wanna get more of his works so I bought this movie. It's the story of a brother & sister who had the misfortune of having a horrible father but a loving mother which set their path in love. Kiefer character was very successful had a great career beautiful house while his sister was still struggling to find your way. He hires her to do a photo shoot and while she's there he tells her he's dying. She reluctantly stays to help him because being around him only serves as a reminder of their lives as children.

8001156,5,B0000DIJNU,"Kiefer Sutherland did three movies for Showtime. This was, I believe, the last of them. They are all wonderful. The first was Woman Wanted, with Holly Hunter, Michael Moriarity and even a small role by Sutherland's mother, Shirley Douglas. Last but not least is Last Light, with Forrest Whitaker. Sutherland's performance in this film is one of the most powerful and moving I have seen. I believe he also directed this film

The Red Door grabs your attention from the beginning and holds tight to the final scene. It's a real tear jerker, not because of any over dramatic writing or acting. The skill of the writers, combined with those of Sutherland and Kyra Sedgewick, make this film so real that the conclusion is hard to bear.

8001160,1,B0000DIJNU,"Same scenes over and over again.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through this movie and just wish something would happen.  I'm tired of B&W flashback scenes that don't mean anything because you can't see what is happening. Just a lot of screaming.  I'm tired of the same scenes of her taking his temperature and trying to help him over and over again. I'm tired of his temper tantrums.  I'm sure there is some sort of explanation of the whole thing coming pretty soon but frankly I've reached the point where I no longer care.  What a waste of money. WELL, I DID FINISH LOOKING AT IT AND - there is no real explanation of anything.  Unexplained things.  He says he needs money but he stops working and apparently the money keeps coming in??? We never find out what happened to the mother, we never find out why the brother and sister were so estranged for so long.  There is simply one scene where the woman confronts her father who, instead of being some big scarey figure is, for Pete sake, the owner of a VERY small deli.  Then the brother dies and that's that. What is so funny is that he never gets any thinner, he never has any spots on his face or torso. I guess Old Keefer was too vain for that. I can say one good thing about this movie.  It is beautifully photographed in a very scenic location.  The brother must have made a lot of money and, I guess, he left it to her because at the end she is still there in the huge gorgeous house on the gorgeous coast.  Kyra Sedgewick was inadequate or maybe she didn't understand the movie either.  One annoying thing is that she thinks acting is continuously pushing her hair behind her ears.  One just thinks that if her hair bothers her that much maybe she should pin it back off her face. Stockard Channing is totally wasted here.
