6675409,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"this is DCs new 52 introduction with the movies.

Justice league: War
Justice League: Atlantis
Justice League: Gods and Monsters.

DC is doing a great job with the scripts and voice over actors.

Cant wait for this 3rd installment of the New52 for DCs animation movies.",1421280000,26,269,4.804347826086956
6675430,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"The most violent DC movie of this type ever! Mexican Superman, Vampire Batman, and wonderwoman's background story and costume is completely different. Not only does Batman kill he drinks the blood of his victims. The first scene i thought they were all new poorly done villains with some dirty spanish speaking creep that turned out to be superman, a really bad costumed guy biting everyone, and some ridiculously costumed girl with some giant thing on her head. I can't say enough about how bad this was! It was laughable at times but mostly just awful sad.",1522281600,,558,4.822916666666667

6675432,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"How this got such a high rating (Rotten Tomatoes) I have no idea. The movie is horrible. It stinks like your trash can after you forgot to bring it to the curb in over two weeks. The plot, while creative, never comes together.",1518393600,2,226,4.27906976744186
6675433,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"I love this reimaging of the Justice League as a darker more tragic real world Justice League. The noir feel, adult themes, and true violence really pull this film together. If you're expecting this to be a kid/family friendly move then you're wrong, this movie is aimed toward a mature audience. DC did a fantastic job with this Justice League and I'd love to see more!",1516492800,,370,4.621212121212121
6675434,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"I really enjoyed this take on the Justice League.

It was a bit more graphic than I was expecting, but that's kind of offset by the more cartoonish character models that are used.

I would have liked to see the characters and stories flushed-out a bit more. I actually would have liked this if it was the conclusion of a two part series.

All that aside, the characters have their own backstories that explore the main themes of the movie ""monsters,"" and with the run-time the film has, it does a quality job of exploring the gray areas around our beloved super heroes.",1516147200,,569,4.504854368932039

The voice acting was almost too good i don't know how else to say it. Andrea Romano, the casting director for the DCU, often referred to as the ""TimmVerse"", because Bruce Timm had his fingers in everything, makes such amazing choices for the people who play the characters its become too expensive to get the original guys to do them sometimes haha",1506988800,,502,4.397849462365591

6675463,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"I think this is perfect animated Elseworld. I find it funny the people who rate this poorly don't really understand what they should be expecting. In my opinion though this movie wasn't made for them, it was made for old school ""Elseworld"" or ""What If"" fans. I think it was probably a hard sell for them to get approval to make this, but for their intended audience I think they knocked it outta the park. This was an amazing look at an alternate world where things happened very different than our Earth1.

6675481,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"DC has cranked out some pretty good to top-notch animated fare with their superheroes and some of this has been alternate timeline or alternate dimension tales/ takes on some of their most beloved characters. This Justice League is an alternate take on the Superman-Batman-Wonder Woman trinity offering us a different take on these characters. While interesting it made me miss what Ive enjoyed most about those iconic characters. The reimagined characters here lack the traits and depth that their time-tested counterparts possess. Here Superman is a reluctant Stormtrooper of sorts, dishing out final justice in sometimes merciless fashion. Batman is an autistic vampire, and Wonder Womans character is a New God from Apokolips planet who escaped the scourge that her duplicitous father was creating. None of these characters are actually Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, or Diana Prince but other persons who have found themselves occupying cut-outs of those heros places in this new telling. They are the gods; and they are the monsters. But they still contend with and for humanity (whom they protect and quasi-rule) until their lacking morals are sorely tested by an old associate of Kirks (Batman). Someone, or something, has been killing people and doing so in a way that makes it look like these heroes are the ones doing the killingits certainly not beyond them. Will they uncover the mystery in time? Can they save each other? Can they redeem themselves? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

In the scheme of DCs animated output this one is just alright. If you're not up on your DC animated movies then move this one to the end of the queue.",1489017600,,1631,5.04074074074074

6675514,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"As I've written in previous reviews I haven't been all that positive with many of the recent releases from DC Animation. But with ""JL: Gods & Monsters"" we're finally given an animated adaptation of an ""Elseworlds"" yarn so it's an alternate world albeit, a stand alone tale. I feel they did a pretty god job overall with this feature. This Justice League is more reminiscent of ""The Authority"" where they have a bit more ""bite"" to them than what many viewers are probably used to. It certainly works here & we're also given a back story to the main characters as well. An enjoyable, fun movie that brought back memories of the classic Justice League & Justice League Unlimited cartoons.",1481414400,,685,4.716666666666667

6675553,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"DC is certainly the leader in animated videos. Gods and Monsters is a nice entry. It takes some getting used to the main characters not being the usual Trinity. It's not the Superman we're used to seeing, or Batman or even Wonder Woman. But they work well together and makes for an enjoyable adventure.",1473120000,,302,4.611111111111111
6675554,5,B00NPHDBUQ,Im glad to see alternate DC universes are beggining to be explored and produced. I think this is a much better storyline that the traditional DC stories for the trio of heroes. Could have described Wonder Womans change better for the new viewers.,1473033600,,246,4.744186046511628
6675555,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"very good for what it is, and extremely well animated. interestingly, this film has thorough well done character development at the expense of the plot and storyline, which is simplistic, though totally coherent. this is an unusual trade-off for an action movie, more often in a modern action movie I would expect to see shallow characters in an overly complicated plot with twists that don't hold up to logic. this film doesn't bite off more than it can chew in terms of storyline, and develops interesting versions of batman, superman, and lex luthor.

this was a great batman backstory. it was very cool to see him overcome a crippling illness, finding a cure for his lymphoma and a way to survive, but at the expense of his personal identity. lex luthor was almost the most interesting character conceptually, because he's essentially exactly the same. he's still motivated solely by his intellect and capable of drastic actions and genius level thinking, but without Luthor's petty needs for recognition and control. this leads the exact same character to take very, very different actions and sends his life in a totally different direction.

I thought this version of wonder woman could have used more thought, her character is simple and obvious with the least interesting backstory of the three. and although I found the voice acting/casting for batman and superman to be very effective and unusual, the voice of wonder woman was boring and generic, with inconsistent and occasionally poor line delivery.

overall, quite fun to watch.",1472947200,,1543,5.066929133858268

6675576,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Nature vs nurture has been an argument that has raged on ever since Piaget first theorized the concept. Whether they realized it or not, Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett waged into the century-long debate with their latest animated original film for the DC Universe, Justice League: Gods and Monsters. The film directly answers the question, what makes a hero?

Taking the iconic DC Comics trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, Timm and Burnett completely flipped the idea of what is a hero by replacing the characters alter egos and origins with individuals who have less than noble beginnings and methods. Even the society it protects, questions if the this incarnation of the Justice League are truly heroes, or just thugs with abilities.

While this issue serves as the underlying theme of Gods and Monsters, there is a story to tell and Timm and Burnett, with an assist from Geoff Johns, weave a masterful Elseworlds tale that features classic DC characters in a different light.

Scientists are being murdered, and while the Justice League takes an interest in the case, it is for more self-serving reasons than for the good and protection of mankind. This alternate version of Superman even poses the question to his teammates of whether the League should just rule the world instead of serving it. One thing is for sure, this is not your fathers Justice League.

Meanwhile, Burnett and Timm give each character terrific and tragic origins, not in the traditional storytelling mold, with all coming in the beginning of the film, but rather in flashbacks, which assists in pacing and getting right to the heart of the tale. All three characters are represented and grow in the film, while the most heartbreaking story probably belongs to Batman (doesnt matter who wears the cowl, does it?).

DNA makes up a lot of who we are as people. If a persons DNA includes that of a sociopath, does that mean that person is destined to eventually fulfill that role, or can they be more? Justice League: Gods and Monsters answers that questions while entertaining fans with what is hands down the best animated feature DC has yet to produce.",1467676800,,2138,4.878787878787879

6675597,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"I quite enjoyed this one. A little predictable, but fun at the same time. It's rare to get a full 100% alternate universe in a video medium (usually that stays in the comics).

Michael C. Hall as Dexter-Batman was great, though he was a little quiet. I loved Kurt's character.

This was nothing revolutionary, but I loved a quick peek into the alternate universe.",1465084800,2,363,4.65625
6675598,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"Gods and Monsters is the very essence of what made reading DC's Elseworlds series so captivating in the 1990s. The big ""what ifs"" using current or past DC source material and characters makes this actually worth the viewing especially if you were fan of the late 90s to early 2000s DC Animated Universe. It so happens that it was created, directed, and produced by the same people of that time. Note of caution though: this animated movie is NOT for children. The violent and language content in this movie was definitely borderline hard PG-13 to R rated.
It was surprising for me to watch a Bruce Timm and Sam Liu creation be this mature. However, it doesn't allow itself to be defined by it. It's an interesting story that I believe is far more interesting than NetherRealm's Injustice: Gods Among Us video game's evil Superman cliche. The""grimdark"" category does reside within it due to the setting and characters, but it somehow doesn't' allow it self to be something typically bland or drab. Instead, like if you were watching Justice League Unlimited, it retains a colorful atmosphere and is full of interesting characters with twists from their source materiel. DC fans can geek out with this like they are reading an Elseworlds story. In my opinion, the Vampire Batman, (voiced by Michael C. Hall (of Dexter fame) was the stand out interesting twist of the three.
My only negatives about this product are two: The origin of Wonder Woman was borderline Disney Princess related to absurdity, especially if you are familiar with anything Darkseid related. Yes, it's an Elseworlds tale, but I roll my eyes and said ""whatever"" in spite. The second, the cover art for the Blu Ray/DVD case is awful and superfluous. DC/WB thought it was safe to place the original Justice League Trinity for whatever reasons and it was not needed since they are NOTHING like them. Part of the fun of watching this movie was guessing the DC references and seeing the twists. So it was too forced and pointless. The comic trade cover would have been better.
The movie definitely stands on its own and it doesn't need a sequel. But I'll admit that I would like to see more of this universe.",1464912000,,2171,4.7612732095490715

As for this movie: the story was so bland I started playing candy crush while I watched and didn't miss much if anything in the movie. As far as the leads, they took everything I loved away from the original three (Batman = realist and ultimate detective, Wonder Woman = Amazon and idealistic, Superman = idealist and ""Boy Scout"") and replaced them with bland back stories and forgettable characters.

But the art was nice and the voice acting was well done, and (even though I hated the characters) parts of the back stories seem more ""believable"" than the originals. I still don't like it but it does have some good points. If you like the ""elseworlds"" ideas please check this out. But if your more like me, save yourself some time and move along.

If you're looking for a different twist on Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, then look no further.  Though they are a bit more ruthless than their counterparts, a humanity seeps through the cracks.  There a few nods and fervent shakes to characters like Dr. Victor Fries (Mr. Freeze), Kirk Langstrom (Manbat), Amanda Waller, etc.  It's a fun little misadventure that runs like a pretty darn good Justice League episode.

6675722,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Personally, I loved the movie. The extra violence and language might put some people off, but in my opinion, they're missing the point. The whole idea behind this movie is that it's darker reality than the usual Justice League movies. Superman is actually the son of General Zod, Wonder Woman is Bekka (one of the New Gods from New Genesis), and Batman is a scientist who accidentally turned himself into a vampire in an attempt to cure himself of cancer. Some of the lower reviews criticize the movie for a ""total lack of story,"" but they couldn't be more wrong. The story is just more complex than we've come to expect from a Justice League movie. There are lots of little references put in that will make the more hard-core comic fans laugh, without alienating people who won't get them as much. In short, it's a darker twist on the main Justice League trinity with an intriguing story and lots of plot twists. There's also some pretty cool tie-in media. To my knowledge, there's three machinima shorts, three One-Shot issues, and a 3-issue miniseries, all can be found by searching ""Justice league gods and monsters."" However, due to the more mature themes, violence, and language, this movie and its tie-ins shouldn't be viewed by younger audiences. I know it says ""Justice League"" on the front, but this isn't exactly your typical squeaky-clean superhero cartoon.",1449360000,,1369,4.854700854700854

Wonder woman offers her body to a cop for information (no, I am not EVEN kidding). Krypton's destuction becomes a weird, liberal statement on the evils of fracking?? This movie has no audience.

Fans of DC will probably like changes (Batman isn't Bruce Wayne, but when you learn who he is, it may make you chuckle, for instance.)
I'd like to see more in this vein, or even in this version of the DC universe, especially when created by Bruce Timm.
(I miss Kevin Conroy as Batman, but since it's not Bruce Wayne, I'll let it slide.)

There are also a number of mini-cartoons that weren't included in the digital copy of this and may be on the Blu-Ray version.
These shorts may give away ""twists"" in the characters also revealed in the movie, so if you prefer to be completely unaware while watching the full movie, you can watch these shorts later. Otherwise, enjoy them now:

6675762,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"If you're a fan of the 90's Batman: The Animated Series or any of its spinoffs such as Justice League, Batman Beyond, Superman: The Animated Series, etc. you will like this film. However, be warned it has a much darker tone than the other series' and is set in an alternate reality.

In this reality, Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are all different characters with different backstories and motivations than their main DCU counterparts, and their scars and histories have made them brutal in their enforcement of justice.

Batman's a pseudo-vampire gone wrong, Superman's the son of Zod and raised by Mexican immigrants and Wonder Woman is a New God with a harsh past. It's an interesting concept with an all original story set in a more violent worls, and it was interesting to find parallels and references to characters in the mainstream DC universe and Timmverse characters.

It's worth watching especially if you're a fan of Bruce Timm's work. The voice acting is great, the story interesting and fast paced and the action sequences well choreographed. The background music is intense and dramatic and the character designs are more subtle but original and fresh. Overall, a great addition to the DC Universe Animated Original Movies lineup.",1446163200,,1251,5.033816425120773

6675788,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"This is one cool, full-length animated movie! The 'Justice League' title might be a little misleading though: The story is set in an alternate DC universe where Clark Kent / Kal-El / Superman never existed, and from there it diverges even farther from the familiar continuity. The not-quite-heroes of this world look a bit like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, but are definitely not them ... saying any more than that would give away some important - and very dramatic - story elements. This is a very Bruce Timm (of 'Batman: The Animated Series' fame) style story; it is sharp-witted, fast-moving, dramatic and more than a little dark. The more you know about DC comics continuity, the more you'll appreciate it, but you don't have to be a trivia expert to enjoy it.
Be aware that this is NOT a Saturday morning 'cartoon' and it is definitely not intended for little kids! It has a complex storyline, plenty of scary, brutal violence, strongly implied sexuality and is generally quite dramatic, dark and intense.",1444867200,,1016,4.878612716763006

6675939,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"There is no excuse. There is absolutely no excuse now as to why Warner Brothers and DC Comics cannot make Alan Moore and Brian Bollands The Killing Joke into an animated film (UPDATE: DC has officially announced that it is coming, see here). Justice League: Gods & Monsters proves that The Killing Joke is just on the horizon. Clearly, a division has been made in Warners DC Animated Universe. On one hand, you have Teen Titans Go! and on the other, Justice League: Gods & Monsters. It is a great time to be a fan of these characters and where DC is going to take us.

Justice League: Gods & Monsters marks the return of Bruce Timm to the DC Universe. The man is responsible for shaping our collective perception of how the animated DC Universe should look and sound. The story of Justice League: Gods & Monsters is his own and is set in a universe very different from the one we know. In this universe, General Zods son is Superman (voiced by Benjamin Bratt). Kirk Langstrom becomes the Batman (Michael C. Hall) and not Man-Bat. Finally, Wonder Woman (Tamara Taylor) does not hail from Paradise Island, but is, in fact, Bekka, one of the New Gods. They are still heroes, just with a darker approach to how they handle their business.

Strange assassins in this universe are killing off the worlds top scientists. They appear through Boom Tubes (transportation devices used by the New Gods) and leave each victim with incriminating evidence implicating the Justice League. The United States government is already on edge with the Justice League and feels that their methods are too violent. They are also beginning to suspect that the Justice League will one day take over the world.

In the course of the story, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman have their unique origins revealed to the audience. Superman was raised my immigrant workers in the US and saw that people only understand force. Wonder Woman left her home after a horrific family coup. Batman, was injected with nanites combined with his own bat formula in hopes of curing himself. It made him incredibly powerful, but he craves blood. Where the story turns personal is when Superman hires one of the scientists to help unwrap Kryptonian technology and the man is brutally murdered. Batman investigates the murder and finds a connection to Will Magnus (C. Thomas Howell), creator of the Metal Men and life long friend to Kirk Langstrom.  All the previously murdered scientists have a connection, they have all worked for Lex Luthor (Jason Isaacs).

Our characters are dark, yet still heroes. It is an interesting approach to the icons we know so well, but it makes for a great story and debate. What if Batman was really a monster? If Superman was raised by good people under the boot heel of another, how would that shape his perception of justice. What if you were betrayed by everyone you cared about, but still wanted to do the right thing? These are interesting characters and, hopefully, this is just the first story in this universe. Batman Beyond started off as an animated series and leaped to the comics. Anything is really possible.

Justice League: Gods & Monsters is a great twist on familiar characters in a completely unfamiliar universe. At no time did the Bruce Wayne or Diana Prince as we know them appear. You expect there to be some connection or hero from our universe to be the main villain. This just wasn't the case. The run time of 76 minutes is staggering because there is so much story here that youll wonder why Timm isn't spear-heading the live action DC Universe. This was one of the best Elseworld stories I have ever experienced. It never held back and followed through with all of its characters. Bruce Timm and his team have set the bar very high once again.

This is not a film for the kiddies. In fact, it may be the closest thing that DCs Animated Universe has ever delivered to an R rating. The unholy Trinity of this story eliminates an early threat so violently, that most parents will turn it off. Ive seen a lot of these animated films and nothing prepared me for this. As a fan and a critic, it was completely refreshing. Just don't let the kids watch it.

If you are discovering DC Comics Elseworld premise for the first time, there is a great special feature titled ALTERNATE REALITIES: Infinite Possibilities on the Blu-ray. Hopefully, with the success of this film, we will see Gotham by Gaslight, written by Brian Augustyn, Holy Terror by Alan Brennert, and Red Son by Mark Milliar soon. My only complaint on the whole Blu-ray experience is that the animated episodes in DC Comics Vault are on the lighter side. Clearly, Justice League: Gods & Monsters needed the 5th episode of the first season of the Worlds Greatest SuperFriends titled Universe of Evil.

Justice League: Gods & Monsters Blu-ray and Blu-ray Deluxe Edition contain the following special features:

ALTERNATE REALITIES: Infinite Possibilities  Justice League: Gods & Monsters falls into a category of storytelling where our well-known characters and the worlds they inhabit are re-imagined. This documentary explores the various attempts by writers to have a little fun and tinker with the characters, resulting in exceptional storytelling that posed thought-provoking questions to audiences.
CALCULATED RISKS: The Making of Gods and Monsters  Justice League: Gods & Monsters was an idea that pushed the boundaries.  It began with that challenging question writers face: What haven't we seen before?  Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett audaciously answered that challenge, resulting in a fresh and exciting film that forces us to think differently about the DC Universe.

In this story's alternate reality, Superman is the son of General Zod instead of Jor-el, Wonder Woman is the granddaughter of an unprincipled Highfather of the New Gods, and Batman is a vampire version of Kirk Langstrom, the ManBat of the regular DC universe. They use lethal force against the villains they face, and are as feared in their reality as their counterparts are admired in their more familiar heroic selves.
  Despite these radical difference from DC/s iconic Trinity of heroes, there is still a nobility about them and a desire for justice, with the difference that these anti-heroes believe that the end justifies the means. Rated PG-13 for comic book violence and a few mild vulgarities, the feature is recommended for adults and mature teens who like intelligent writing and superb voice acting.
  The only reason I gave JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MONSTERS four stars instead of five is that the bonus material contains only two cartoons from the DC vault instead of the four classic cartoons in previous Blu-ray presentations. The two cartoons are both excellent, but I felt cheated. It was like  going to my supermarket and finding food at the same price with less content than my previous purchase of the same item. This short-changing is inexcusable. A Blu-ray disc still has the same amount of space available. Why not fill it up for those of us who chose this format over the lower-priced DVD? We consumers have come to expect better from DC.",1441929600,,1680,4.943262411347518
6675942,5,B00NPHDBUQ,Great movie.  Interesting take,1441843200,,30,6.5
6675943,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"The return of Bruce Timm is a welcome one! As a kid who grew up on the Bruce Timm DC universe with shows like Justice League and Batman Beyond, I have a fondness for Timm's darker worlds and irreplaceable style of animation. Props must be given to the animators of G&M because while they embrace the old Timm style that I know and love, they make it look crisp and smooth for your modern animation pleasure. G&M presents an enticing mystery to solve while watching how our darker heroes came to be with interesting, unique origins. Even if a third or more of the film is filled with exposition-esque backgrounds, the stories pulled me in as they shift what we know and love about our normal DC Holy Trinity. The movie is very mature and dark so caution is definitely advised for younglings, but if you like a more adult tale for your comic book characters, you'll enjoy this movie! The special features are a nice plus too, especially for the price, and I'm already hoping for a sequel with this universe only just having been set up! If you want more though, just check out the Gods & Monsters shorts they released before the movie on YouTube, telling a short story about each character. Superman is my favorite, but each one has an awesome, different story to tell. That wraps up my review so I hope you found it helpful and enjoy the movie!",1441843200,,1343,4.485714285714286

Zodd.  Batman is the more tragic, but brilliant Kurt Langstrom, and Wonder Woman is Becca, a former New God fleeing her family's great treachery.  You might think in this alternate world, with humanity rising against them, that these three, this trinity, would go super villain.  But the lines of what makes a hero are blurred.  These three super powered beings are all that stands between all humanity and an insidious enslavement.  This original animation turns everything on it's head, with more twists than a rubix cube on crack.  I loved it.  I want to see more of this universe big time.  Bruce Tim design work.  Glines.

I have always hated the fact that the bad guys kill, murder and rape but only get beet up, well with the exception of batman, he at least cracks joints, breaks bones and snap joints. This version of Superman, Wonder woman and even Batman was exceptional and really enjoyed. I like this whole alternate universe storyline and would watch it again and again.

So I loved this.  Man-bat as a vampiric and tortured Batman was perfect and I adored everything about this AU version of Bekka.  Finally, the story is about *her*.  She is not another side dish of angst for Orion, no, she is as vital and vivid as Diana has ever been, and just as warlike.  Just as compelling.

The real kicker for me, though, is Superman.  Because while Zod's genetic imprint is evident in him, so very much also is Lara's.  His actions show him to be a good man; hard, yes, but still protective and still, at his most basic, a believer in doing the right thing.  Never has it been more evident that Lara is a huge portion of what makes Clark Kent such an amazing person.  And how much do I love that Lara is the deciding factor in this world, when historically DC has always made such a huge deal of fathers as opposed to fridging or making ciphers out of mothers.

What really drove home how much Hernan Guerra is not Zod - and *is* Superman - is his encounter with Luthor on the space station.  Luthor basically destroys his image of his own history... and he leaves.  He doesn't kill or destroy, he just tells Luthor that Luthor is as much Superman's creator as Zod and leaves.  Exactly as Clark would have.  Then he almost dies protecting the planet from Magnus and his killer robots.  Just another day in the life.

Now I want to know what Diana and Bruce are up to in this world - if they're part of it or not.  But I guess that's what fanfic is for.",1440633600,3,1499,4.274021352313167

or swear, or drink, or ""have relations,"" or any number of other foibles we mere mortals indulge in....would we still call them gods...or monsters?

bruce timm and team have crafted a really good story which sadly suffers from the fact that the movie is marketed as a ""justice league"" movie....if only they'd have titled the release ""dc alternate universes"" or ""dc elseworlds"" I don't think anyone would be complaining as much about the movie as they have in previous comments.

that said, only giving the release 4 stars instead of 5 due to the bonus content....a retread of the ""new gods"" bonus feature that was originally released with the ""superman/batman: apocalypse"" movie release as well two bonus cartoons-the legion of super-heroes episode ""phantoms"" and the superman the animated series episode ""brave new metropolis""?

while I'm ALWAYS happy to see the LSH being promoted wouldn't the justice league ""a better world"" episodes featuring the justice lords have been a better choice for this release?  or, if wanting to spotlight the LSH, why not ""the man from the edge of  tomorrow pts 1 & 2""?

I've explored a bit of the comics but not much at all, however I love the shows & movies that refer to the comics; the geekier it is, the more I love it even though I don't read them. (Example: one of my fave JL episodes is ""Eclipsed"": I lend my dvd out to any body with a sense of humor: it was 3x more hilarious the day I discovered the comics character Eclipso!) After I discovered Murakami's Teen Titans & anime, I retroactively caught up to the JL shows & movies which linked me to the Batman cartoons I loved in the 90's. So kudos to Kevin Conroy, Andrea Romano, as well as McDuffie, Tucker, Riba, et al., But for the last 7 years, I dedicate every Friday night, (and $16.99 for a 75 min. movie every three months or so) chiefly because Bruce Timm, in his collaborative flexibility & vision, is a mark of stories I adore again and again and again. So I bought Gods & Monsters without even reading how unusual the storyline would be, THRILLED, because I knew I'd be spending Friday night watching a Bruce Timm cartoon, and of course, it was better than I expected: engaging, witty, savvy, thought provoking, and appealed me as an adult w/o the excess megaboobs and savage bloodletting: just gourmet story and character development.

6676086,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"This movie is just plain bad. Once again, DC attempts to attract ""mature"" viewers. Do they write more sophisticated plots? No. Do they elevate the story? No. Do they offer challenging themes? No.

By ""mature,"" they mean that they had a group of fratboys put in as much inane sex and violence as they wanted. In the opening five minutes, we see characters impaled, bludgeoned, crippled, ripped in half, burned to death, shot, crushed and decapitated. The movie is no better for any of this - it's just senseless, poorly animated violence delivered with hackneyed dialogue and awful acting.

Added to this, the filmmakers determine to incorporate as much offensive sexual innuendo as they can. Don't get me wrong - Sex in the City was hilarious. But in this movie it's just god awful. In one scene a female character says ""this designated driver is leaving,"" to which her boyfriend replies ""but I'm your boyfriend - you're supposed to drive me tonight."" Ugh.

6676097,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Visionary and indispensable producer, Bruce Timm, has returned to show the directionless and
mediocre hacks at Warner Brothers Animation department what drama, pacing and originality are all
about.  Justice League: Gods and Monsters plays out like one of the many great Elseworlds
tales presenting an alternate take on the big three classic DC archetypes (Superman, Batman and
Wonder Woman).  The Authority (comic book series) is the closest analog to what we get in this
production.  The plot begins on Krypton and cleverly twist the origins of the Kal-el giving us a
superman more in the vain of Philip K. Wylie's Gladiator.  Batman and Wonder Women are
also made over and cut from much different cloth than there more familiar versions.  DC fans will
recognize other characters from the DC Universe in strong supporting roles.  The story itself
is a murder mystery were the Justice League is seemingly being framed for murder as to bring on
a direct confrontation with the government.  The timeless theme of absolute power corrupting
those in power remains fascinating and relevant more than ever..

The Justice Lords from season two of Justice League episode (A Better World) are mere bench
warmers compared to these guys.  The characters are fleshed out and presented interestingly
energized by fluid animation and solid voice work.  Those expecting the silliness of Superfriends
or the ineptitude of the so-called New 52 will be greatly disappointed.  Flashpoint?  Joke.  Get a life.
I trust the volume of positive feedback will entice the sorely missed, Mister TImm, back for future

6676102,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"In this completely worthless and lacking adaptation of the Justice League, we see what would happen if the three biggest members of the league were murdering dictators.

Superman - Coming from humble Mexican upbringings Superman is raised by a Latino Mexican version of Johnathon and Martha Kent, whom I can only imagine raised this superman on the lessons of pinning down small rodents and torturing them.  As well as a very large sense of Latin pride.  Oh his dad is Zod so he's meant to be this way.  Apparently DC has solved the nature vs. Nurture argument is and hour and 20 min.

Batman.  He's a vampire.  They went twilight on this one guys and gals minus the sparkling skin, the only benefit is that Michael C. Hall plays his voice.  Apparently nanotech makes you into Edward Cullen and gives you the voice acting chops of Kristen Stewart.  Blah blah blah I suck blood.

Wonder Woman - She's an angry ginger with large breasts.  As if you'd like anything better.  They should have thrown in an Irish accent just to make this a little worse or maybe just  pictures of Maureen O'Hare.  Oh, and she's got a sharp sword that cuts tanks in half.

If you're bored one night in yuor mom's basement and like bad fan fiction turned cartoon.  Well then, watch this.  If you're DC and you're trying to combat MARVEL's new reboot of heroes...well get you own under control first.  Thing about money is is always comes back around.

Just to let you know, Lex Luthor is some paraplegic Brainiac and it just makes the story that much worse.  This is like ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" in animated form with more swear words.

I myself don't mind the idea at all. However, I felt the execution fell flat. The plot felt underdeveloped, the villain's scheme was outlandish to the extreme the whole thing was a bit too grim. Also, Batman's costume was fairly boring.

Take High Father and Dark Seid; they existed long before the whole Batman, Superman, Earth adventures, etc.  So why would they be different?  It's almost like the writers/director said, ""Let's just change everything to opposites or just make them different.""  I doubt High Father would have been different because a handful of events changed.

6676123,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"The DCU video library has been rapidly growing but, in recent times the quality of the films has been declining. Thank goodness for Bruce Timm making his return as executive producer alongside Sam Register. This time we get a brand new original story based on the cult favorite 'Elseworld' series as well as some great throwbacks to the now legendary DCAU.

Justice League: Gods and Monsters is the story of the big three DC Superheros (Superman, Batman & Wonder Woman) like you never would have imagines. In fact, these three may not even be what you were expecting at all. The film features a prosperous alternate universe on a razor's edge as they are unsure if the Justice League will be the saviors or the conquerors of the world. The story features many easter eggs a fantastic and strategic placing of separate origin stories as well as a few DCU firsts like Will Magnus making his first appearance. The film is far from perfect but, it is a breath of fresh air compared to the last few releases. It was also wonderful to see the original Bruce Timm animation back along side one may be the most mature storyline thus far. The story is also not as action driven as recent releases rather the best parts of the film reside in the dialogue and interactions of the characters.

As I said this new edition is far from being the best (Batman:Under The Red Hood still holds my top spot). However, with Timm Burton back to oversee the 2016 releases I feel that we will see the next chapter in this series of films to get back to where they once were. Especially with the news of one acclaimed story transitioning to film with a familiar face from Bruce Timm's world returning from a long break.

This is the toughest, most adult, darkest, grittiest Justice League movie I have ever seen! Lots of cussing, EXTREME violence, and strong sexual innuendo GALORE. This is not made for kids, believe that. Superman is General Zod's son but unaware of it and is a hero but still uses controversial methods, murder being one of them. NOT KIDDING. Wonder Woman is not from Paradise Island/Femascara but is actually the daughter of the head of the New Gods and is murderous and pagan in battle with a costume that barely covers her attributes. Batman now is a vampire but not by spiritual means; more like Micheal Morbius from Marvel Comics who is a vampire by science, not magic. Superman and Wonder Woman are very similar in power levels to the ones we are accustomed to but Batman gets a major boost. Super strength, speed, and flight on a level with Spider Man or Spider Woman if you include Batman's new flight ability. Imagine Batman Beyond almost exactly but with a real thirst for blood. PG-13 is almost not enough but I would not rate this R. It is more like PG-16 if they ever were to make that rating.

6676138,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"I had high hopes for this movie based on the Chronicles series featuring the titular characters. The Chronicles shorts were compelling and showed that although these guys were heroes, they were dangerous and perfectly willing to take the lives of evil-doers. They had great fight scenes and even some heart-rending drama. So naturally the main event featuring them would be just as good, right? Sadly, that's not quite the case.

The main problem is that in reinventing these characters, it also becomes necessary to reintroduce them. And this is quite a task--all the exposition takes up at least half of the movie, and some of it goes along at a very slow pace. It's like, did we really need the scene of those dead rats getting thrown away? Granted, there were some really good moments in the backstories, but they also disrupted the flow of the main plot. At more than a few points I wondered when the movie would just get on with it.

Batman seems to be the weak link in this movie, which is surprising since his Chronicles short was probably the best of all of them. His backstory is, unfortunately, the dullest, and worse, it's integral to the entire plot of the film. Throughout the movie, Batman is constantly getting his butt kicked and can't keep up with the other team-members at all, ultimately proving less effective than the normal-verse Batman despite having actual super-powers! The normal Batman keeps up with the other JLA members with his arsenal of gadgets and ability to improvise, but this Batman didn't even throw a Batarang--not that I can recall--and this is while punching way, way above his weight class! As a character, he's interesting if a bit dry, but this movie did not give him the chance to shine, really. As for the other heroes, I don't have any particular complaints aside from feeling like the movie didn't quite fully deliver on the premise of dark heroes protecting a world that's scared of them.

Lastly, the movie's big payoff for all that exposition wasn't much of one, ending with a fight sequence against a villain whose motivation for being evil made absolutely no sense. I could spoil it for you, but I'm not sure if I could write it out without going into convulsions. It was the biggest letdown of the movie.

I know I've been hard on the film, but there were parts that I liked, and I do think these characters could have more adventures if DC Comics is willing to go further and darker with the concept. And with all the character exposition out of the way, maybe we could get a better movie out of the deal, too!",1439424000,,2565,4.655629139072848

6676150,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"While not being the first DC Universe movie based on an Elseworlds story, Justice League: Gods Ands Monsters is an original story in the spirit of Elseworlds and other ""imaginary stories"". This was written and directed by DC animated alumni Bruce Timm, along with Alan Burnett and Sam Register as a darker version of the Trinity, while excluding most of the other JLA regulars to make for a more streamlined storyline.

Set in a parallel universe from the canon DC comics, the last survivor of Krypton is actually the biological son of General Zod who as a baby crashes not in Smallville, but by immigrant Mexicans. Years later, more egotistical version of Superman has formed an alliance with two other heroes to form the Justice League. Their version of Wonder Woman is not an amazon but Bekka, an outcast resident of New Genesis and wife of Orion. Batman is Kirk Langstrom, while in the original universe he occasionally was Man-Bat is instead here an artificial vampire in the spirit of Mobius the Living Vampire who has none of the weaknesses of a vampire but still sometimes craves blood. The Justice League maintains a shaky alliance with the U.S. government, with Steve Trevor as an agent having an on-again/off-again romance with Wonder Woman. Lex Luthor has had knowledge of Superman's alien origins for years, and help form a group of eager scientists to come up methods of applying the little Kryptonian tech for the American armed forces. Members of this select think tank are being killed off by mysterious super-powered robots made to look like it's the League assassinating them. This trail leads Batman to his old college mates, Will Magnus and his wife Tina, whose research accidently help transform him into a bloodsucker. From them, Batman learns about a project title Fair Play, but sees all the other scientists aside from Magnus get killed by the robots. To uncover the mystery, Superman visits the aging Luthor in his orbital satellite who tells him that Fair Play was the government's contingency against the League if they ever went rogue, but that someone else is using this advance technology to frame them. Superman leaves, but witnesses Luthor's space pad getting destroyed, and the army thinks Superman blew it up. The armed forces converge on the League's tower, but Magnus' awakes inside after being brought back via nanotech magic, and reveals that the robots were his creations. Magnus years ago had killed Tina in a fit of rage because he was tired of hearing her ask him to help cure Batman's condition, so he recreated her as Platinum and decided to use this version of the Metal Men to take out the League, but also to gain access to the Superman's old ship to power up some device for him to launch a wave of nanobots all over the world to take everyone's minds. The League fights back at the Metal Men, and thwarts Magnus' plans while proving their innocence. Luthor appears at the end in his teleporting chair and offers to take Wonder Woman back to New Genesis, while the World's Finest stay behind to reconsider their approach to peacekeeping.

This made for an interesting take on the Big 3 of DC, with alternate versions of various DC characters, including a male Cheetah, a laser gun-toting Livewire, and legit takes on Mr. Freeze and Dr. Silvana. The animation is above average, although the story could've used a little more tweaking. There's so far been a 3-episode online animates prequal series to the movie, although for some reason it wasn't included on the Blu-Ray or DVD release. There's also a series of one-shot comics, and a 3-issue mini-series tied into the movie, although so far no plans have been made to have the Gods And Monsters universe crossover with the canon DC comics. This does make for a great take on the Justice League in an alternate reality, and a great leaping on for any fan of superheroes, although its not totally for kids.",1439251200,,3904,4.816691505216095

6676173,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Just finished watching, along with Jeff H., ""Justice League - Gods and Monsters"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Justice League - Gods and Monsters"" is set somewhere in DC's vast multverse of their ever-expanding Elseworlds series.
The Superman of this universe is actually the son of General Zod who inserted his DNA into the birth matrix that Jor-El and Lara were about to launch into space before the destruction of Krypton.  Raised by migrant farm workers - this Superman is darker and grimmer and has absolutely no problems in killing terrorists.  Likewise the alternate versions of a New Gods Wonder Woman and bio-engineered vampire Batman - they too kill without hesitation, much to the chagrin of their American minders led by Steve Trevor.
Yet the uneasy status alliance between this darker Justice League triad and law enforcement is shattered by the vicious killing of members of an elite scientific community that had once been led by Lex Luthor.
Spoiler Alert - Superman, Wonder Woman, and Bat Man are being framed for murder by someone who is control of boom-tube using robots that kill by mimicking the powers of the superheroes.
""Justice League - Gods and Monsters"" is perhaps the best in a long line of animated adventures in the DC universe of heroes and villains. Jeff H. commented that it's a shame that there are no big screen releases of these animated DC tales.

It's such a departure from the JL movies of the recent past that the reviews / ratings are likely to fall into the 'love it' / 'hate it' camps, and not much in-between. I thought the overall story line was rushed, and not well thought out. Think about this: There must have been a writers' meeting where someone proposed the idea of Batman being Dracula, and dressing Superman like Blade... Additionally, proposing the idea of rebooting Wonder Woman by taking away her lasso and arm bands, and giving her a super-sword. Oh, and dressing her all in white with a matching Galactus helmet....

I've collected DC cartoons for a long time, and enjoy many of the twists and turns the comic world has to offer. What I think has always set the characters apart from the run-and-gun franchises of Marvel Comics has been the philosophic tensions and backgrounds to DC's characters. This, in many ways, aims their cartoons at an older audience.

A very underrated DC cartoon was actually the Wonder Woman movie they made several years ago (also available on Amazon instant video). Nathan Fillion (Firefly, Castle) does a very good job as the male protagonist, and their relationship in the movie is very PG and appropriate for the warrior-like heroine. It was, in my opinion, very tastefully done for one of the less-liked franchises in DC.

If you're committed to DC, this may be worth a watch. But as someone who genuinely enjoys them: it's too dark for your kids, and not a good enough story for adults.",1438905600,4,1091,4.731578947368421

6676237,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"ELSEWORLD TALE. NOT FOR CHILDREN.  Bruce Timm returns with a bang!

This is a fantastic movie! A murder mystery that twines through into a maniacal plot to destroy life as we know it.

There's something about Timm's pacing and narrative style that I love, and have sorely missed with many of the recent DC animated releases. If you like Timm's work, then I highly recommend this title. In fact, I would encourage the 1-star reactionaries to watch or read some Timm interviews about his intent, give yourself some time to cool off, and try it again. If you bought the disk, there's a nice piece about the making of on the extras.  That way, you can compare the movie to what it _is_ rather than what it isn't.

I don't want to give spoilers, but I respectfully disagree with those who were negative about the ending twists. I thought it all wove together beautifully, and there were many surprises I didn't see coming. All in all, a nice, fresh take. It was vaguely reminiscent of the Identity Crisis story.

Extras: I was very happy to see a High Def version of the Legion of Superheros cartoon. I'd love for WB to release a blu-ray set of that under-rated series, but am not holding my breath. This may be the only episode of that series in HD, as season one was released on DVD and no season 2 release ever. So, that was a nice treat.

6676238,2,B00NPHDBUQ,"Not the worst DC anime I've seen but not great either.  If you are going to take such huge liberties with established characters and alternate timelines, then do a good job with their personalities, backstory and heck, the basic plot.  None of these was done overly well.  The overall impression was.....they could have done better....a lot better.  To the point that it just doesn't make sense at times.

In this rendition, the Justice League are not bad guys, nor are they good guys.  In fact, their motivation seems pretty vague, shifting and at times, one dimensional.  Large swaths of plot are introduced, often for reasons that are pure propaganda, then don't anywhere.

Superman, for example, is found and raised by illegal aliens.  Which might be an interesting plot development except super homeslice is clearly whitebread and they barely mention it.  He's also the genetic offspring of General Zod....which doesn't matter in the slightest.  Wonderwoman is barely any better.  Her origin is dramatically different than usual and what they cover is interesting.....except, they left out the part as to why anyone should care or why she is on earth instead of New Genesis.  Batman is by far, the worst.  He's a vampire with no regard for human life whatsoever.  Why he shouldn't be exterminated on general principle is a subject oddly avoided.

Again, the JL aren't good guys, nor bad guys.  Nor do they seem to particularly work for the government and have vague, poorly described plans to take over.....which is then never mentioned again.  They are basically a bunch of jackasses with superpowers doing bad things to people its not really clear are bad guys or good guys and no reason to really care.

This is a poor, poor, very poor copy of much better done, far more popular alternate time line.  Nothing here that hasn't been done before only much better.",1438732800,5,1868,4.926282051282051

The characters' backstories provide insight into each's struggle with their basic goodness even as they do terrible things and the beginnings of their raise toward true heroism.

Despite all this and great voice acting and characterizations by Michael Hall, Benjamin Bratt and Tamara Taylor, everything is dragged down by a really weak story and a dissatifying conclusion.

Overall I'd like to see more of these characters but not if main plot continues to be this lame.

6676250,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"Spoilers Included

I admit not knowing the cannon that this film is based on, and I hope the knowledge would improve one's understanding of this film's plot.  I've enjoyed and own many of DC's former animated offerings and think them far superior to Marvel's animated films.  However, this particular film seems to miss the mark.  The plot though very dark seems almost random.  You receive brief flashbacks that try to explain why the current incarnation of this justice league is brutal in its methods.  It then randomly (again, I'm not familiar with the cannon) has Luthor rescue the world a couple times.  I think the worst part of the film was the weak link towards an unrequited love being the basis for destroying the world.  Sigh.

The voice acting is fine considering what they had to work with but one is better off renting/buying the myriad of other Justice League films and series available.",1438473600,4,903,4.811688311688312
6676251,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Not some much that I loved it- but it is a darn good show.  I'm not much on DC's and current Movies changing the Superman I know.  I can only guess they are running out of ideas.  But knowing this is an alternate universe and the these 3 weren't suppose to be the same ones we grew up, I liked the twist on the characters.
Story good:  check.  Interesting characters:  check.  Great Voice acting:  check.  Plot twists:  check.
Only 2 small details I personally wasn't fond of:
1.) The majority of the women in this show.
Wonder Woman drawn as a model.  I'm not saying Wonder Woman should be ugly.  I just always imagined her as tall and masculine - in a good way.
I hardly consider myself a feminist.  But it seemed every women in this movie had a perfect body, round face, pretty har and beautiful eyes.  That is. except for the Scientist woman and the president.  And the President was a character from the DC universe already, so they were forced to not draw her as a model.  I can only guess they do this to keep the teen boys happy.
2.)  The recent trend that studios feel that cursing is needed in comic books.  Are there no more kids reading comic books anymore?  Are we so limited in our knowledge of the English language that no other words can be spoken?
However, neither of those two caused me to dislike the movie.  It just could have been better in my opinion.

I really feel like they help teach them good values, such as Spiderman's ""With great power comes great responsibility...""  Usually.  But this series from DC has begun getting a bit too violent for my taste, or my comfort level.  In this series there is blood flying, bullets hitting heads with splatters of blood and brains being blown out, and at one point a main character is painfully skewered on the tip of a bloody sword that springs out from the front of the chest.  That's just one fight scene, and there are many.  MANY in this movie.  So, no, I didn't like this one, and I won't be watching this series with my kids anymore.

The story is definitely original in terms of who's the villain but the idea of the government concerned about the ""justice leagues"" power is something already explored ESPECIALLY by Bruce Timm.

It just didn't feel like a justice league film. I don't want to give any spoilers but I will say it felt like a story about characters we know from the dc universe but with different paths for said characters. For example, Wonder Woman is a new god and batman is Kirk creator of the manbat in regular storylines. This might as well have been a completely new entity using different characters and still have the same storyline.

6676267,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"I didn't buy this movie, I rented it through Amazon. To keep it to the point. It's simply a tell of an alternate reality where dc big three hero's aquire their same alternate identity under much different circumstances and origins.

The animation quality is very good, akin to 90s boxed chin batman. Kevin Conroy isn't voicing batman either. Surprisingly enough it's Michael C Hall of Dexter fame doing voice work for the now vampiric batman. I'm guessing his work with blood on Dexter has a lot to do with it. To be honest he does a impeccable job portraying a cold, emotionless, caculated batman!

As someone stated earlier it is short. The chunk of the story revolves around the 3 protagonists origins a bit of mystery and a rather explosive, argessive, and damaging resolve. This story is a bit dark. For God's sake superman has a goatee with a loyd Christmas from dumb and dumber haircut
So you should know things are gonna get serious! 16 dollars might be too much for such a short story. Maybe 10 dollars? Maybe? But this is definitely worth a rental. Or if you're a for hard... I say go for it! This movie is awesome with surround sound.

6676284,4,B00NPHDBUQ,First off I want to say that I've never read like superman red son or other elseworld things of that nature but after watching this change my mind. Bruce Timm's back to do the story i'm glad for it making superman's father zod is scary and badass at the same time but he's not as I thought again just a badass. The changes in this are great like evil new gods and another person that's not a wayne or not associated with him being batman was just cool. I love the story it's kinda noir to me but it all comes together very well. The voice cast did a amazing job I liked Michael c hall as kirk Langstrom for some of the time when he talks about blood I can't help but to not think of dexter lol. I for one wish there would be follow up to this world but if it just be this i'm ok with it. Welcome back Bruce Timm we missed you,1438300800,,825,3.9166666666666665

6676289,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"In an alternative universe \where the heroes aren't quite as saavy at controlling their image or direction, this justice league is yet again facing a threat from within their inner circle.

The film isn't wide-reaching or grandiose as other JL films but it is a more than welcome change-of-pace that encourages and challenges the viewer to watch for the slight permutations to the canonical mythos of JL.  Lois Lane takes a car is one small example.  Sorry for that very minor spoil, it's hard to write a review without giving even the smallest thing away.

Gods and Monsters is a good story, but in the I found it remarkably bittersweet statement of the depth of these characters and the nearly universal human struggles--just because they have superpowers, doesn't mean they don't have hearts that can be crushed as easily.  In this way, the film is kind of a humanizing gem for the hero trope that has us thinking about that retroactively and progressively as we enjoy these stories.",1438214400,2,986,4.845238095238095
6676290,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"Disappointing.  The animation is largely the same as we've seen in the other DC animated movies, the voice acting is hard to judge.  The script is quite frankly pretty bad which results in some flat lines for the actors to read that I don't think anyone could actually make them sound good.  To be blunt it was a waste of potential.  Even more so if you've watched the short films on youtube, which are significantly better than anything that happens in this movie.  To give you an example of how poor the writing is the movie largely ends with a literal Deus Ex Machina appearing and fixing everything.  The Justice League really doesn't do anything other than get their asses kicked or when that's not happening spending the bulk of the movie in flash backs to their unnecessary origin stories.  The movie leans on the crutch that this Justice League will kill people as basically their only characteristic, something that's actually undercut in final scene with Superman suggesting all this killing isn't helping.  Ugh.

Personally I almost feel like I wasted my money getting this.  If you're sitting on the fence I'd say don't bother unless its on a step discount.  Though I know most of you reading this are comic book fans and will buy nearly anything that has DC/Marvel plastered on the side.  So to all you casual fans out there, realize that most of the reviews for these movies are by people wearing roses tinted fan glasses and adjust your expectations accordingly.",1438214400,,1477,4.749019607843137

6676293,2,B00NPHDBUQ,"The animation was solid, and Benjamin Bratt and Michael C. Hall gave the best performances they could given their lack of experience in these roles. However, this movie misses a lot of opportunities. Tamara Taylor's performance as Wonder Woman was less varied than that of the other main actors, and the film explored the backstories of Superman and Wonder Woman very insufficiently.

""Gods & Monsters"" also doesn't treat female characters well. Wonder Woman's history introduces her and her fiance as political bargaining chips, and the writers treat her as a sexual object on more than one occasion. They include gendered slurs in the dialogue for the insults' shock value when other insults would suffice, and the film's creators kill one woman off screen to cause emotional turmoil for the male charactersa tired trope if there ever was onewhen leaving her alive would have had the same or more emotional potential.

The villain revenges himself against the three members of the Justice League and seeks to enact a diabolical, world-altering plan when his grudge apparently extends only to one member.

There is supplemental material available to address the poorly-developed characterization and minimal backstories, including comics and short animations. Consuming these materials beforehand may improve the film's coherence to you. However, I feel that the creators would have been wiser to include this content in the film itself.

Jason Isaacs's performance as Lex Luthor was very enjoyable to hear. He's using his ""Admiral Zhao"" voice.",1438214400,4,1545,5.345679012345679

6676307,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"First of all these are not the same characters from the comic books or the other shows. The only thing that remains are the alter egos. Does that make sense at all? These are new characters that use the original characters as a loose basis. So knowing that if you were hoping for the orginal members of the justice league look elsewhere, but if you can keep your mind open the you're going to get a great story with a decent plot and actual character development which you can't say of all animated comic book movies, or even all the live action ones. By far the best story belongs to this story's batman. In the normal DC universe Kirk Langstom is the man-bat, but here he's a vampire going by the Alter ego of batman. Kirk definetly gets the most development and is the most tragic figure in this tale. Michael C hall does the voice acting and I was sceptacle at first but he voices batman as very cold and distant, it's just the slightest shade of Mr. freeze from the orginal batmna animated series from the 90's and it works really well for the character. Wonder Woman also has an excellent backstory, in this she is no longer Diana Prince, her name is Bekka and is the grand daughter of the high father of genesis,DC animated knocked it out the park in in Justice League War with regards to Diana Prince Wonder Woman so the bar was very high. Where Gods and Monsters succeeded was in not only giving this Wonder Woman a tragic backstory but keeping her strength intact. Justice league war succeeded in the action but at times treated her like the fantasies of 15 year old boy instead of being a fully fleshed character. Now for superman, poor Superman, he definetly gets short changed in the story department, this super mans father is Zod, and that's about all we get. When I heard that superman in this story was found by mexican farm workers I was excited and scared at the same time. It's basically added so that he can spout a few stereo typical spanish one liners and nothing more. I don't even think we learn his real name in the movie, I had to look it up. Whereas we get to see what transformed and ultimately drives Wonder Woman and batman we never get that with superman. He mentions dealing Justice with a heavy hand because he's been on the receiving end of it but we never see that. i think they initially went into supermans story ready to tell a more detailed story but perhaps the poltical climate would have created to much controversy so the played it safe or maybe his story was cut. By rooting his origin in mexican american culture they were inviting controversy but they seem to have stopped short of actually addressing it. Over all though this movie is great and tells an interesting story. Whoever is working on the live action Wonder Woman should really be paying attention to this movie and its treatment of Wonder Woman. Another review a read mentioned game of thrones in regards to wonder woman's story and I feel it's an appropriate description. It tells a great tragic story with a powerful female character, and it feels completely appropriate in the setting of new genesis and Apokolypse. If you don't like change this movie isn't for you,but if you enjoy a good storytelling,El Superman aside, then this is a fantastic watch.",1438128000,,3265,4.535593220338983

6676314,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"So my first thoughts were, Anything with Bruce Timm's name attached has got to at least be sampled. And I was right.  Gods and Monsters is a retelling of the traditional stories of Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, often called the Trinity of DC comics.  Instead of Bruce Wayne you have Kirk Langstrom, a mistake of science made him a Vampire.  Instead of Clark Kent you have Hernan the Kryptonian son of General Zod raised by a migrant family to the U.S..  Lastly we have Bekka of New Genesis, one of the gods of New Genesis Bekka's reason for leaving the New gods is explained in the film.  These are not the Super Friends, nor the Justice League Timm has given us before.  This Justice League has no problem killing the bad guys.  For more introduction into this world there is also a line of comics I highly recommend.  Three on each of the main characters and a nine comic series on the Origin of this strange form of the Justice League.

First I have to say, animation is fantastic, the action is smooth and dramatic, you can see the artistry, the weight behind every punch.  Amazing fights in this film.  There's a mystery which is something that hasn't been in many of the DC Animated films, you actually do not know who the bad guys are in this universe because it is such a new and different world there's really no way to know until it is reviled.  All the characters are very well thought out very dynamic and growing throughout the film.

This movie has let me put faith back into the DC animated films, the last few were alright but didn't really have the kick as some of their earlier work.  Unit this one came out that is.  If you are a DC fan if you like Elseworlds and alternated universes, this is a must see.  And if you want more backstory on these characters there are shorts out there with each as well as the comics.  Check it all out and pick up or rent this movie, I'm pretty sure you'll like it.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

Slight edit: sorry about this but I felt strongly that this was important to say.  Just finished with the special features about the film and some of the background stuff.  Loved it!  These are the kind of special features they used to have, where they go in depth with the creative process which for this film was very, very deep.  Loved these special features so that's one more thing this film has brought back from previous DC movies that makes it just little sweeter.  The more I watch the more I'm enjoying it.

Thanks for reading this edit and have a nice day!",1438041600,,2534,4.363247863247863
6676315,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"SPOILER-FREE REVIEW AND A VIEW TIP

I highly recommend watching the three vignets that DC put up on YouTube that precede this movie. They add about 20 minutes to the overall length and help flesh out the characters even more than the movie.

Anyway, this is not your regular Justice League. I'm OK with that because the core aspects of the characters that make them who they are remain, though not as purely as I would have preferred. They are similar in tone to the Justice Lords as seen in the Justice League cartoon.

There are some very enjoyable things in this movie:
1) The three main characters breath in a way we haven't seen in a long time in a DC animated movie.
2) The animation is top notch. Like Justice League Unlimited or Young Justice top notch.
3) The story uses a familiar theme but keeps it fresh.

However there are some things that I didn't like enough to mark off one star:
1) It is excessively violent in spots. Unnecessarily so in my opinion.
2) The movie takes up too much time with back story on the heroes. The narrative ground to a halt every time it happened.
3) The voice overs were too tepid. The actors recite their lines like a normal movie which does not carry over well into animation which lacks the subtlety of real facial expressions. That's why there are professional voice over artists.

Don't get me wrong. I liked this movie more than any DC animated movie in a decade.  And I sincerely hope this is the start of a series. There is a lot of creativity here that can really deliver the goods.",1438041600,,1533,4.418439716312057

6676317,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"I was extremely skeptical watching this feature. I was pleasantly awarded with a great story, great action and drama. I actually ended up caring about the characters by the end of the film. You need to let go of preconception to truly enjoy this. This is an alternate universe where some things occur differently, so those expecting Bruce Wayne/Batman etc, will not be seeing those characters. Please give this a shot and I do agree with other reviewers that this one is not good for all ages unless you allow your children to watch it under close supervision. That way you could address any mature themes that they may not understand. The only graphic depictions is blood and any sexual situations are only alluded to.",1438041600,,719,4.76
6676318,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"THE GOOD: Solid storytelling with an interesting premise. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are all different--darker--people assuming the mantle of the classic heroes, so for once their being overly brooding and grim actually makes some sense. The story really informs you about how and why these new versions of the Big Three are who they are, and it makes you care. They are a deliberately brutal departure from the classic Big Three, but in spite of that, they seem to have a code of honor and principles we can grasp onto--like any good anti-hero story. Seeing the alternate back story of these heroes unfold is as intriguing as the mystery they are solving.

This is finally a premise that rolls with DC/WB's new found insistence of sucking the ""fun"" out of its superheroes . . . which in turn, actually makes this pretty fun! Top notch action, animation, and voice acting that you would expect from this series of movies, in addition to a return to the classic JLU/Bruce Timm model sheet style that makes the action really pop.

THE BAD: Like a lot of the more recent Justice League movies, this one is dark and a lot of blood gets splattered. Fortunately, the Justice League seem to only hurt the bad people (unlike in other movies like Flashpoint Paradox where DC Heroes are psychos for seemingly no reason). Admittedly, the grimness kind of works because the premise is a very deliberate departure from classic DC. There is no Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, or Princess Diana in this world, so at least we don't have to feel like those characters are being sullied. Some fans may still not care for the re-imagining.

THE UGLY: In spite of getting a Justice League that feels a little bit more like Marvel's Punisher, thanks to good writing, these characters are somehow a lot more likable and relatable than the New 52ish League we've been seeing in more recent DC animated movies. Yikes! :)

Overall, a fun premise, well done! You can tell that the old guard of talent from DC Animation was heavily involved, and it was refreshing!",1438041600,,2038,4.732394366197183

I just finished watching what is basically an imaginary story (or Elseworlds, which was one of DC's best imprints), Justice League: Gods and Monsters. Bruce Timm (an animation God to those who are fans) hit it right out of the park. In this alternate look at the DC universe, Superman is the son of General Zod, Wonder Woman is Bekka of the new Gods, and Batman is Kirk Langstrom, known in the regular universe as Man-Bat. Batman is a Vampire in this. I'm not going to give away any secrets here, but the story is fantastic, with a quite unexpected character the villain. A lot of winks at the regular DC universe, but this is really a very hard PG-13 as far as ratings go. As usual with DC, the voice talents are stellar and this is well worth watching.

JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MONSTERS may give audiences the DC 'Holy Trinity' of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman as dark, tragic, 'a hair from' anti-heros, but it in no way compromises their nature as compelling and fascinating characters.  Throughout the course of the film's narrative, these new versions of our beloved heroes overcome their tragic backstories to shine through in the film's climax, delivering the thrills and inspiration inherent within their historic iconography and classic iterations.

In the film's alternate universe, General Zod is Superman's biological father, and the Man of Steel was found and raised by hispanic migrant farmers.  Batman's identity is scientist Kurt Langstrom, whose attempts to cure his progressive cancer with an experimental bat-serium (amped-up on micro-eccellerant particles) saved his live, but turned him into a vampire.  Wonder Woman is a fallen Goddess who, after rejecting her family's betrayal and killing of the alien Darkseid and the entire population of his planet, chose self-exile on Earth.  The three operate out of the Hall of Justice in Metropolis, using aggression and violence to implement the takedown of hostiles and high-risk targets for the U.S. Government.  When prominent scientists begin popping up murdered, and circumstantial evidence points to the 'God-Like' Justice League, an already tense relationship between the League, U.S. Government and public grows tense and quickly collapses.

With a story co-written by Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett's screenplay is stunning.  It's adult writing on a structural, emotional, and intellectual level that evokes Frank Miller and Alan Moore's best work of the 1980's.  The cast delivers top-notch performances across the board, with Michael C. Hall's restrained yet heartbreaking Batman/Kirk Langstrom being a unique stand-out.  Kudos to director Sam Liu for simultaneously capturing the look of Bruce Timm's DC Animated TV series of the '90's and melding it so well with the kinetic adult action, violence and epic vistas of this century's greatest DC Animated Original Movies as pioneered by the great animation director Jay Oliva.  As always, composer Frederik Wiedmann delivers a complex, moving score that is layered to accent both the epic and intimate.

Finally, a special mention must be given to co-Executive Producer and co-Story Writer Bruce Timm.  This is his return to creative production work on a DC Universe Original Movie since his supervising production duties on the DC Universe Original Movie's epic, ground-breaking, and classic BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, PART 1 and PART 2.  This film at times has the feel of the 1993 Bruce Timm co-directed, Timm and Burnett co-produced, and Alan Burnett co-scripted classic motion picture BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM - THE ANIMATED MOVIE.  That film is still considered, by many film critics and Batman historians, to be one of - if not the - greatest and most authentic Batman feature film ever made.  Timm's return here, and re-teaming with longtime collaborator Burnett, has yielded not just the first 'Elsewhere' Justice League film, but perhaps the greatest Justice League film ever made.  Here's hoping, with the outstanding achievement that is JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MONSTERS, and the upcoming 2016 adaptation of Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"" that Bruce Timm will Executive Produce, that Timm's return to the DC Animated Original Movie Universe is a permanent one.",1437868800,6,3840,5.468697123519458
6676331,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"Meh.
Justice Leagues: Gods & Monsters presents DC's foremost characters in an alternate timeline where they are loved and loathed equally. It's an interesting idea but it would've be much more powerful had the three superheroes - Supes, Wonder Woman, and Batman - kept their unique backstories. Instead Supes has anger issues, Wonder Woman's name is Becka and she is bit of a femme fatale, and Batman is .. well he's a Vampire bat. With those three at the helm, the story doesn't seem to be about the Justice League at all. It seems to be about a different (and oddly less interesting) set of characters with which we don't have much of an emotional connection. The Justice League is familiar; these folks are not.
The plot centers around an attempt to frame these three for a series of grisly murders; they have murdered in the past, and ultimately bring them to justice. As one would expect, these heroes carry their fair share of baggage and demons that makes them the obvious suspects.
Nothing about the story is bad. But nothing about the story is fantastic either, and considering that these folks are damn near gods in this universe and in the DC universe, that does seem to be a bit of an injustice.",1437782400,,1207,4.644859813084112
6676332,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"This movie made me realize how great animated media can be.

While not the traditional DC Superheroes many know and love, this darker take on the DC universe was made exceptionally well. The writing is fantastic and makes the audience sympathize with the characters. The voice acting done takes it all to another level as well.

I would recommend that anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a darker tone for an animation watch this as it was fantastic, I hope they make more like it!",1437696000,4,478,4.546511627906977
6676333,4,B00NPHDBUQ,Its a cool concept overall.  I like the feel of Wonder Woman though the history is a bit hard to swallow as it is far more than a minor timeline variance.  The Luther and Super dynamic and history was really good and help something rich.  The batman aspect is something I thought I'd enjoy more but they lost something of the quality of the Batman that makes him endearing with the transformation.  The storyline though is solid and the twist is respectable.  Actually I was going to give it 3 stars but after contemplating the whole we'll bump it to four if you consider the story as a whole.,1437696000,,593,4.4036697247706424

6676343,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"The long awaited return of Bruce Timm was expected to bring a breath of fresh air back to the DC universe.  Unfortunately although the concept itself is a novel idea, this movie falls short of the very high standards set by fans of the legendary Bruce Timm.

As with most of my reviews I shy away from spoilers and this one will be no different.

While I can appreciate the concept and unique vision the creators had in mind. This feels appropriate for maybe a DC animated movie 10 years ago. With DC animation shelling out pretty decent to amazing movies (Looking at you Dark Knight Returns!) this feels like a giant leap down from what we have previously been treated to.

Overall if I was to rate the movie using a 1-10 scale I would give it a solid 6, I definitely can see people loving this movie and as excited as I was, unfortunately I was not one of them.

The climax just sort of happened really suddenly. I really wanted to get to know this world and why people felt the way did about the League.

I really enjoyed this story and the characters in it, I just wish we got to explore a little bit more before reaching the end. I hope we continue go to explore this universe either in more animated features or comics",1437264000,,675,4.384

6676355,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"Before all else, you must ask yourself if you like alternate universes.

No? Then don't watch this. You won't like it.

Yes? Then this is one of the best DC toons that WB has put out in a while.
First off, its all-new and all-original... WB's previous attempts at adapting book stories have been hit and miss, and when you try to adapt seminal works like Dark Knight or All-Star Superman, you're going to lose a lot in translation.

2nd, if you're familiar with the Elseworlds imprint from DC Comics, and you enjoy those alternate universe stories, this is most definitely a story that could have the Elseworlds label on it.

A completely alternate universe DC with no crossovers, the story covers the origins of these very different heroes.. ones with questionable morality involved in an actual conspiracy/mystery. You are drawn in because you never seen this before, and because you want to know how its going to end. Tossing viewers into unknown territory is a great way of telling an all-new tale.

As a Dexter TV series fan, I also love hearing Michael C Hall voice this very different version of Batman (without giving too much away, for comic nerds, I give you a hint: Man-bat crossed with Blood Reign... pretty cool!). Wonder Woman being a god of different sort (but from a pantheon familiar to DC fans) and Superman... this is no spoiler since its the first 5 minutes of the film: But ask yourself, ""What if Superman was the son of Zod rather than Jor-El?"".

Again, I highly enjoy alternate universes and Elseworlds, making this a 5 star affair for me. It helps that the story is well thought out, and the animation meets expectations. Perhaps we will eventually see a crossover where the proper JL runs into this alternate version? I could only hope so.

1 star haters pretty much from people who never heard of Elseworlds or the Multiverse, or only ever want to watch JL Unlimited or Batman TAS episodes... those fans will never be satisfied",1437177600,35,1953,4.692982456140351

God forbid if they do something different from classic adaptions.  With that being said the movie is the best DC has to offer since Flashpoint paradox.  DO NOT go into this movie expecting the norm in any circumstance because it isn't that.  Betrayal, killings, tons of action, far from boring, very interesting, characters you can gravitate towards. Hell what more do you want from an animated movie? Plot is pretty basic for a beginning movie.  Yet still highly enjoyable and watchable.  Can't wait for more.

His goal was to reimagine the characters, maintaining their basic powers, but completely changing their origins and nearly everything else. Apparently this was done to the characters of Flash and Green Lantern during the transition from the Golden to the Silver age at DC.

Anyway, that's what has been done to the DC big three. As a result a great deal changed, yet the points of similarity are all the more compelling. In the end it's a most enjoyable experience.

Each character was given a flashback origin - Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.  I found Wonder Woman's story the most compelling - *SPOILER* - it was quite a switch to see the typically virtuous gods of New Genesis transformed into a group of treacherous murderers.

The visuals and voice acting were top notch.  It's great to have Bruce Timm back again.  I'm looking forward to seeing future episodes of this different Justice League on YouTube.",1436832000,52,716,4.87603305785124

6676375,2,B00NPHDBUQ,"I recently caught the world premiere of Gods & Monsters at SDCC 2015 and my excitement brought me back to my childhood because Bruce Timm was spearheading the project.  They also had a panel discussion and it was a real treat to see some of the voice actors and Bruce Timm speak, but unfortunately, the excitement stopped there.  G&M had so much potential, but the execution was poor and storyline very boring.

Characters:  G&M is a reimagining of our fabulous Justice League trio Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.  Sounds great, right?  But the problem is they literally scrapped their backstories and changed the heroes so much that a lot of people in the audience around me were muttering, how is this even Justice League?  It shouldve just been some random Superhero movie.  Superman is now the son of Zodd and now raised by Latino immigrants instead of the Kents.  Batman is no longer Bruce Wayne, but replaced with Kirk Langstrom, a devoted scientist, who in his pursuits to cure cancer ends up becoming a vampire.  Wonder Woman is now the granddaughter of High Father of New Genesis.  Lex Luthor works for the government and eventually becomes a mix between Lex Luthor/Braniac/Metron.  They also throw in a few other cameos here and there from other characters e.g. Ray Palmer, Amanda Waller, etc.

Plot:  There is a fragile alliance between America and the JL as the people always question who guards the guardians.  This alliance is shattered as a slew of high-profile scientists start dying and the killers utilize abilities/weapons that mimick those of the JL effectively framing them for the murders. JL tries to figure it out and it ends up being someone you don't expect yadi yada.  The story starts off pretty slow and takes about 30 minutes to really pick up.

Overall:  I had high hopes for this ever since I heard it was announced and bringing back Bruce Timm, but as stated I was sorely disappointed with the execution.  However, they did reveal at the panel that they are going to continue this as a web series and also listed some releases coming next year such as the Killing Jokes so there are some things to look forward to.  I may give the web series a try, but was pretty turned off from this movie.  I feel as if they were trying to recreate things to fit more with the times, but went about it pretty lazily by completely discombobulating the franchises iconic characters to try to bring freshness.  For example, their attempts at ethnic diversity by reintroducing an iconic character like Superman with Latino roots.  If they really want to bring some kind of diversity, try to make new characters and champion those instead of changing the staple of characters everyone knows. Vampire Batman really had no place in this nor did changing Wonder Womans Greco/Roman roots.  I can understand changing a few characteristics to change the universe/origins, but so much was stripped away that it did not maintain any of the integrity of the characters they were supposed to represent.

I would give the film a 2/5.

Oh and parents curious if this would be appropriate for their children.  Bruce Timm deviated away from the kiddie violence like in Batman the Animated Series.  Now we get something thats grittier and darker with blood being spilled left and right, people being impaled, immolated, or being squashed.  Keep that in mind if you're sensitive to exposing your children to that sort of thing.",1436745600,6,3429,4.8136752136752134
6676376,4,B00NPHDBUQ,"A return to the better DC animated movies.

I know many are hesitant to get behind this film. After all, it is not the Justice League you grew up with. Instead, each of the big three comes with their own twist on the classic heroes, but they bring a unique sense of newness to the show and learning their origins is fun. I will not spoil them for you in this review, as seeing them is half the fun.

Justice League Gods and Monsters takes place in an alternate universe yet manages to maintain strong threads to the casts you're already familiar with, but more importantly, it brings with it some heart. The movie spends time helping you get to know the heroes, and even better, letting you care about them. This isn't your JL movie of late where it's quip, punch, quip, punch. No, the action sequences are shorter and more meaningful. And the film is better off for it. Most, this movie reminds me of perhaps Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman. Not the greatest of the DC animated films, but at least a step back towards where you cared about what was going on, and you felt some level of sympathy for the heroes you're supposed to root for.

The plot is a little cheesy, especially the villain's overarching master plan. It hearkened back to something found in Justice League: Doom. Don't expect to be blown away. You do not need to have seen the Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles movies, but it wouldn't hurt to give them a view. There's three of them, each focusing on one of the 3 JL members. They're on youtube, and 5 minutes apiece. They give each character a little more flavor, and help set the tone.

The violence is about what you've seen in the DC animated films lately. Borderline R, but cutting away at the last instant or showing the gruesomeness in shadow to soften the blow a bit. The language is hard PG-13, too. No sex, but some brief sexual innuendos between a couple characters. However, all the moments are sparse enough that kids 12 and up shouldn't have any trouble with the film.

Voice acting is another area w/ improvement. Of the 3, Michael C Hall gave the most lackluster performance, yet still brought a different spin on the Batman. Benjamin Bratt and Tamara Taylor both do excellent work. Jason Isaacs also shines as Lex Luthor.

Overall I recommend the movie, especially if you're a fan of the older DC stuff and haven't appreciated the tone, plotting, and dialog of the recent stuff we've been given from DC/WB animation.",1436659200,34,2463,4.5610859728506785
6676377,5,B00NPHDBUQ,Justice League: Gods and Monsters put a different spin on everything. there was a lot on tension the whole film but it was very interesting.,1436659200,3,140,4.64
6676378,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"So, rather than make a commentary on violence in media, the sanctity of the 'poor children', or bloodlust in society; I'd rather review this as a film. From the PG-13 rating, assume the subject matter is not intended for little children and use some discretion in showing this to the younger set. I personally, would have loved something like this as a teenager. There will be minor spoilers, but none of the film's twists will be discussed or described.

Pros: Quality Animation, Excellent Characterization, Self-Contained World, a decent examination of power, control, public perception, and grey morality. Bruce Timm.
Cons: May require broad familiarity with the DC universe. Infodump flashbacks.

It might be easy to initially dismiss this movie as an  elseworlds tale of a 'Dark Justice League.' This is not Bruce, Clark, and Diana. Batman is a vampire, Superman was raised by Latino immigrants, and Wonder Woman is one of the New Gods. They are ruthless, violent, and unconstrained by morality or public perception. They openly discuss taking over the government and asserting their rule by force. They are feared, distrusted, and described as an organization of terror. After a sequence of terrorist attacks serves to frame this new Justice League for even greater crimes, they must track the source of a threat to themselves and the entire world. In the process, they must confront their personal demons, government and media hostility, unexpected allies and foes, and determine for themselves whether they choose to be Gods or Monsters.

Bruce Timm spearheads this alternate take on the Justice League, and I will say unreservedly this man is likely DC's greatest asset. He understands how and why these characters resonate through the ages. He easily creates an entirely new take here, while using it as a vehicle to examine core themes behind why the Justice League works in any iteration. Truth, Justice, Morality, Responsibility, Repercussion, Regret, Redemption. This is what elevates this movie beyond simply being 'Dark JL,' as while their methods and motivations are quite different, what makes their actions heroic or horrific does not. These are flawed characters who are each trying to figure out their own idea of what Justice is.

That is to say, the writing is quite good. It manages to give new origin stories to the three major characters, builds a new world, hit some major themes, and tells a self-contained story within this context. Now, admittedly I approach this as a slathering DC fan, so I was able to easily pick up on minor mentions and easter eggs, and understand how shifts in this universe are reflections of what I already know and love. I cannot give an accurate impression of how someone who isn't a fanboy might take this film. It seems like you can go in fairly ignorant of most, as they do manage to detail through extensive flashbacks how these characters came to be, but I cannot help to think non-fans might get confused quickly without an understanding of Mother Boxes, New Gods, Metal Men, and various characters in the DCU. There is a lot of material covered very quickly, and while the flashbacks are helpful, they border on expository infodumps.

The animation is top notch, fluid and exquisitely choreographed. It is very much inline with previous Bruce Timm fare (Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, Justice League, JLU). The violence is not toned down, as these characters by their nature are far more brutal than previous Justice Leagues, but it makes sense for the characters in context, and to complain about the violence I feel is actually missing a huge point the film is making and part of the very reason this movie doesn't feature Bruce, Clark and Diana.  These are different characters entirely, but across the multiverse gap still assume the mantle of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. Examining the differences in motivation, modus operandi, and attitudes in contrast to their brighter counterparts can give some very fascinating insight as to why the characters of the Justice League work on paper and on film. To which, I must simply reiterate: Thank the Gods for Bruce Timm.

THe more I think about this film, the more I enjoyed it. It was intelligent while action packed, and lingered in my mind far beyond my viewing. I hope they further expand this universe in various forms of media.  I also recommend checking out the Machinima Gods and Monsters chronicles, which are shorts featuring these characters. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.",1436659200,9,4534,5.002652519893899
6676379,2,B00NPHDBUQ,"Most of the people who are reviewing this on Amazon haven't even seen the movie yet.  My son and I watched the actual movie last night thanks to our connections for early release, lol. My son and I have watched every animated Justice league movie there is and we watched this one with a very open mind...however, this Justice league movie was plain garbage.  The idea of an alternate universe could've been really cool but instead the whole storyline stunk, the movie was absolutely boring and no...this is not a kid friendly movie. It seems to me that in an effort to try to cater to the 30-40 year old comic book fans who want non-traditional heroes, pointless violence, excessive blood, sexual innuendo, cursing, and the like (think Hancock), this fits the bill.  However,  for the rest of us that want the Justice league  without all that...this film isn't it.  I don't know what the rating is on this animated film but it should be PG-13 at least.  We are very disappointed In DC for releasing this gargage but oh well it's just animated baloney.  Don't waste your money.",1436659200,7,1076,4.656084656084656

Animated doesn't mean it's for kids, neither does live-action means it's for adults. Your kids are going to grow up doing whatever they want whether you like it or not. They know SHOULD know the difference between fantasy and real life (if not, that's bad parenting). They might or might not get the hints this movie is going to show when it comes out, doesn't mean you have to baby them through it.

6676387,1,B00NPHDBUQ,"...transferred to animated form. The trailers I've seen...has me anxious to add to these animated films. I was surprised to see the animated style of Bruce Timm's animated series. But BT's storytelling has always been topnotch. Gods & Monsters is original story, not adapted...(if I missed the story in comic form....I stand corrected). This story should be good! The one star does not reflect JL Gods & Monsters is a bad pic...I have rate it to post a review.

July 28, 2015 update:  Wow! Good film. The plot. The character depiction. The animation is good. Nice spin from Luthor to Superman and everyone inbetween. The only one who didn't deviate from who she is....Lois Lane. But for those who don't read reviews ......I liked it.... liked it a lot! I saw it too. *****stars",1432771200,3,777,4.791044776119403
6676388,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"UPDATE: Having watched the 3 mini-sodes on Machinima, I say that this is without a doubt, NOT SAFE FOR KIDS. As was made somewhat evident by the shows description a bit ago, this is most certainly more adult themed and not likely suitable for younger children. What the mini-sodes do show is a very promising for the full movie release and set up some interesting character dynamics and situations. Without giving anything away, go over to Machinima and check out the Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman mini-sodes and get a taste of some damn fine Bruce Timm work.

Given the past success rate for Bruce Timm associated animated properties (Batman Beyond, Batman The Animated Series, Superman The Animated Series, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, Green Lantern The Animated Series...) its a safe bet to say that this will in all likelihood, be pretty damn good.

Bruce Timm is a proven property in the animation world and nearly everything he touches is golden, so to have high hopes for this series is not the least bit unwarranted given his track record. To those people who may have only a passing knowledge of Timms work, please be aware that even though this is an animated movie produced by Bruce Timm, the subject matter is going to be adult themed and most likely not child friendly. Do yourself a favor and watch trailers before buying this if you had planned on getting it for a child, because from the things I've read, this is likely not going to be appropriate for younger Timm fans.

To those who aren't yet aware, JL:G&M will also have a series of shorts appearing on the Machinima network. While I don't know the exact number of shorts being made for the series, they will be approximately 7-10 minutes each by all accounts. According to news sources, the Machinima series has already been picked up for a season 2, which looks very good for the series for sure!

While I haven't seen the movie yet and cant speak to the actual quality or lack thereof, I am hopeful this will continue the successful record Timm has produced to date and be just as good as his previous works. I am giving this a 5-star rating and will amend this review and score once I have actually seen the movie and give more specific critique once its available. Like I said previously, given his past record of work, its not a completely unwarranted idea to think this will be a strong showing once released.

I'm writing this in hopes it might help people make a decision about placing a pre-order for this item, who might not be strongly familiar with Timms work and might want some more information to help make a decision on the matter.",1432339200,21,2636,4.648068669527897

8679694,5,B00NPHDBUQ,"Now that's the way to make a comic book movie.  The characters are more complex than a typical DC movie.  Great alternative interpretation of classic charactes.  There aren't too many fight scenes, but that's actually a good thing.  Everyone's motivations are clear and have enough logic to see why they are doing things.  By the end of the movie, lessons are learned, not everything is fixed, but it shows the move in the right direction",1527033600,,438,4.786666666666667
8679695,3,B00NPHDBUQ,"In this alternate universe, a vampire Batman, a Wonder Woman who doesn't come from Themysciera, and a genetically altered Superman are the only members of the Justice League of America.  They are a brutal, not to say murderous, trio, and they are considering whether or not they should rule the world to save humanity from itself.  Amanda Waller is president of the United States, and Lex Luther is a good guy.  In this twisted reality, someone is murdering the world's leading scientists and making it look like the Justice League is the culprit.

This is an intriguing story line, but it is marred by the artwork and less than inventive animation.  This was Bruce Timm's most recent venture after having left the DCU for a time, and the artwork feels older, almost rushed, barely serviceable.  Other recent DCU movies may have their faults, but the artwork and animation of all these later movies has been just this side of breathtaking.  Most of this artwork seemed cartoonish and not quite worthy of the mature storyline.

And speaking of mature, I rather wish I had been warned that we'd be regaled with the name of Jesus or his title, Christ, being taken in vain.  I wouldn't have purchased this video had I known that.  Of course, perhaps that's why it wasn't mentioned.  I can't be the only adult on the planet who would prefer his children not be subjected to profanity in cartoons.  Why Bruce Timm and others insist on placing profanity in the mouths of their cartoon heroes when they must know that children will watch these titles is beyond me.  When I checked the PG-13 rating box, it mentioned only the violence and graphic pictures.

Well, hopefully, my review will at least help those parents who care to give this animated movie a pass.

Profanity aside, this is an intriguing story line that simply isn't very well executed.  It's not bad, but neither is it very good.
