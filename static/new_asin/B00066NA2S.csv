8039286,5,B00066NA2S,"I studied with Sensei Ajari in the early 1970s. Sensei Ajari introduced Wado Ryu Karate to the USA and is the real thing--in an area with lots of pretenders and wannabes. Anyone seriously interested in Japanese Karate, Wado Ryu/Wado Kai in particular, should study this set. This is really the definitive Wado Ryu. Hats off to Bien Sien Lee who made this happen, and helped record all of this for posterity. When watching this, keep in mind that in 2003 when this was filmed, Sensei Ajari was about 75 years old. The techniques are exact and traditional. I am surprised and honoured to be the first to review these DVDs. Well worth 10 times the price. Thanks for reading. John",1476316800,,676,4.641666666666667
