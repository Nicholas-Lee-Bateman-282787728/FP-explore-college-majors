7989224,4,B000094FGI,I bought the dvd for my nephew who really likes Dennis the Menace and he loved it. Great price as well.,1372118400,,103,3.9523809523809526
7989225,3,B000094FGI,"On the day we got this my son (age 6 1/2) watched it three times, and he laughed at a lot of the gags, even the third time around. Adults may be able to chuckle once or twice but mostly they will wish they were watching the 1950's TV version of Dennis, which in my opinion was much funnier and had more charm.
Although the DVD is region code 1, there were no problems playing it on a European DVD player which had been switched to codefree use.",1061510400,,444,4.056818181818182
