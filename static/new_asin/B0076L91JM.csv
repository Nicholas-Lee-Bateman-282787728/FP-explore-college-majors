5057539,3,B0076L91JM,"Not a very good concert, even with John Wetton and Steven Wilson. There was no fire or emotion, just lak-luster playing. Sorry Guys ! But I do love the other 4 dvds that I have of Steve Hackette.",1340236800,4,195,4.157894736842105
5057540,5,B0076L91JM,"Last night I finally watched the ""Fire and Ice"" concert DVD by Steve Hackett and his band. I purchased the DVD a month or two ago, but didn't ever get the opportunity to watch it in it's entirety. The DVD was released last February and was out of stock for a while on Amazon. At any rate, this DVD is simply AMAZING! Another high-quality show from Steve! Such an amazing tour! He was also joined by Steven Wilson and John Wetton!!! His bassist Nick Beggs was simply an amazing guy to watch! Nick also plays and tours with Steven Wilson. But of course watching Mr. Hackett play guitar was the absolute highlight! There is no one who plays as brilliantly and with such range of emotion as Steve does. So very, very skilled and gifted. All the musicians performances were top-notch. It just doesn't get much better than this! Also got to relive many old Genesis songs and moments! Sometimes brought tears to the eyes! Much of the DVD included songs from his then current album ""Out Of The Tunnels Mouth"" and they also played one track from the (then being worked on) album ""Beyond The Shrouded Horizon"". All in all a fantastic show! VERY, VERY, recommended!! Worth every penny!!",1339632000,13,1175,4.6
5057541,4,B0076L91JM,"First of all, this is the longest DVD of all Hackett's DVD with a running time of 2 hours and 26minutes. So we have a lot of material here, but the DVD contains no extras. The quality of the songs is good from start to finish with 1 song from the ""Beyond The Shrouded Horizon"", and 5 from the ""Out of the Tunnel's"" cd. With this latest stuff, we have some favorites old songs and some Genesis tracks, and if i am not mistaken, this is the first time, at least that Hackett played ""Carpet Crawlers"" on a DVD.

The camera work is good and the only audio option available is a very nice 5.1 surround sound that offer some nice surprises along the show. There is some newcomer in the musicians department with a female guitarist (Amanda Lehmann) and Nick Beggs of Kajagoogoo, yes this is not a joke. They both did a nice job with their performance on that show. All in all, it's a very good concert to have in your collection, that would have been better if the picture quality for the distant shots in the back were not as blurry as they are here. Just for that detail, this DVD is not as good as is previous one ""Once Above a Time"". Oh Yes, Steven Wilson played on 2 songs, and John Wetton in one, the Bob Dylan's song ""All along the Watchtower"".",1337990400,21,1244,4.226890756302521

5057543,5,B0076L91JM,As always an extraordinary performance by Hackett and his band. Old songs like Shadow of the Hierophant with special guest Steve Wilson is a must.,1439769600,,146,4.88
5057544,5,B0076L91JM,"Hooley Dooley , they talk about rock n roll gods , guitar Gods etc etc , then they talk about Steve Hackett !!!!!!! , Its amazing to think that this quite unassuming fellow keeps knocking out amazing chunks of work, from his early days in Genesis to what he's doing in 2015  it never ceases to amaze me that his works are consistently of a very high standard , innovative , and enduring, LETS HOPE THERE MORE MUSIC TUCKED AWAY IN THE VAULTS, because I for one never get tired of Steve's work!",1421107200,,492,4.290322580645161
5057545,4,B0076L91JM,"This DVD has two very strong attributes in its favor. First, this concert features 5 songs from Steve's CD ""Out of the Tunnel's Mouth."" Second, this tour features the best band line-up Hackett has ever put together (in my opinion.) The addition of Amanda Lehmann's strong vocals and guitar work, along with Nick Begg's amazing bass guitar, really solidify the band. I sought out this particular show because it features so many songs from ""Out  of the Tunnel's Mouth.""This is my favorite recent era CD from Mr. Hackett.
 All in all, this is a very strong performance from the band. My only complaint is with a slight audio distortment in Steve's guitar at the end of ""Fire on the Moon""- the problem was recorded in the source audio. It kinda stuck out like a sore thumb in through my Bose audio system.
  One of the strongest highlights from the concert is Amanda Leahmann's exceptional lead vocals on ""Shadow of the Hierophant.""",1419552000,,929,4.751552795031056
5057546,3,B0076L91JM,"I had bought this product a couple of months ago for a Christmas gift.  I gave it to my husband early (I couldn't wait to watch it), we listened to it and enjoyed the music, but it constantly skipped!  How embarrassing is that?  I can't return it because it's been too long.  Other than the skipping, Fire & Ice concert was awesome!",1418860800,,332,4.306451612903226

5057548,3,B0076L91JM,It was a very good concert. Simply wish the audio was not so fuzzy. Kind of like the microphones had 2 socks over them.,1394150400,,119,4.0
5057549,5,B0076L91JM,I have seen this show live once and bought tickets to see it again.  I have been a Steve Hackett fan for years and saw the early Genesis shows many many time.  this is well worth your time to watch.  I watched it on amazon prime and didn't buy it because I already had the copy of the show in Germany,1391817600,2,300,3.8852459016393444
5057550,5,B0076L91JM,"Probably the best touring ProgRock band at this time. Even though this is a 2011 lineup, his current 2013 (Genesis Revisited II) lineup is virtually the same.",1383523200,2,158,4.888888888888889
5057551,1,B0076L91JM,Great music. Terrible video quality. Basically unwatchable. Don't waste your time. Amazon needs to weed out these sub-par videos. Very disappointed.,1380758400,,148,6.095238095238095
5057552,5,B0076L91JM,"Once again, Steve Hackett and band put on a show that shows off their incredible talents and technical ability by playing faithful renditions of songs from across Mr. Hackett's legendary career. The video quality  is very good, and the sound quality is excellent. Steve Hackett is playing and writing better than ever, and this video proves it. For anyone who loves prog rock, a must see!",1374624000,2,388,4.878787878787879

if you like early genesis
wonderful musicians
great sound
What creativity
Great guess performance

5057554,5,B0076L91JM,"Steve has been, IMHO, the only member of Genesis who has kept the true spirit of the band alive...the adventure, the passion, the romance, the very soul of the band...

Nick Beggs on Bass and Chapman Stick is incredibly entertaining to watch, Roger King is obviously a stellar keyboardist and engineer and Gary O'Toole is not only an excellent drummer, but carries vocal chores most admirably. Strongly recommended to Prog Rock fans and those who appreciate virtuoso musical performances in general. Can't wait for the show in Chicago Sept. 21st!",1371081600,6,546,5.066666666666666
5057555,5,B0076L91JM,"Steve Hackett shows again that he still holds the legacy of earlz genesis with pride. The band he plays with is great, musically, there is really nothing to complain about. The only downs are the quality of the video at times (in particular the views of the whole stage are literally nothing but noise), and the lack of any bonus material. This is however just nitpicking, all in all, if you want a great Hackett show, this one is a good choice.",1369872000,,445,4.439024390243903
5057556,1,B0076L91JM,"My player is a top of the line region free Oppo, and this DVD does not play...it is factory defective, or at least some of them, and should be recalled. BTW I have a torrent downloaded copy from a PAL version...DVD-9 and it plays with no problems, so it seems that is the NTSC version!!! I was refunded, but I want to get an original NTSC copy that works!!! Not sure if that is a common issue but that was my experience...",1363910400,5,422,4.158536585365853
5057557,5,B0076L91JM,"Nothing better than Genesis..........and Steve Hackett is Genesis, as well as Phil Collins, Michael Rutherford, Peter Gabriel, and Tony Banks....................what we should all do as fans is herald their re-union to perform The Lamb, and watch it lie down, live, on broadway",1360022400,,277,5.619047619047619

5057560,5,B0076L91JM,Steve Hackett is one of the finest and creative guitarist and musician.  We look forward to his upcoming tour to promote his new album.,1354320000,2,135,4.625
5057561,5,B0076L91JM,"It's refreshing to see that Steve still hasn't lost his ability to blow one's mind with his infinite ability to create captivating atmospheres with his guitar.  This presentation, like many of his, are a must for any collector of great prog concerts.  I can't wait for the next one!

8510956,5,B0076L91JM,"Steve is the only member of original Genesis to keep the heart of Genesis music alive, while also doing ethereal, classy, interesting music on his own. He's one of the world's guitar virtuosos, and a genuinely nice man who has always provided the highest levels of musicianship and performance integrity.",1466899200,2,304,5.1
8510957,5,B0076L91JM,"I've been a Hackett admirer for decades. When I found this in my Prime list, I was very happy indeed. Exuberant performance by a very tight and passionate band! My only complaint is that there wasn't much of Hackett's classical guitar work- admittedly not the focus of this particular performance, but a neglected part of his repertoire, I think.
The wide variety of material presented helps keep this from becoming a ""Genesis cover band"" affair (which I write while mindful that there have been some wonderful Genesis tribute bands!).
We all have our personal favorites, and I would have liked to hear live interpretations of Racing In A... from Please Don't Touch, Shadow of the Heirophant from Voyage of the Acolyte, and some of the material from Midsummer Night's Dream. But their absence in no way detracts from what was presented.
This show moves and pulses, smart and deliberate but never cold, despite Steve's on-stage statement that it was filmed on ""the coldest night of the year"".
I think I'll go watch it again!",1466467200,2,1023,4.885057471264368

8510961,5,B0076L91JM,"Steve Hackett is definitely still one of the top shelf guitar players. But you also have to acknowledge the phenomenal band that he has assembled. It's almost hard to comprehend how good all these combined musicians are. Each member of the band is a thoroughly accomplished musician and they play close attention to the quality of the songs. The thing that I see is most, is that they love the music as much as Steve Hackett loved creating it. A lot of these songs have take a new shape and form. It seems like these new Renditions also have taken in consideration the different artists now playing with Steve and their Style and ability seem to shape and blend these new Renditions.",1459296000,2,683,4.60655737704918

8510963,4,B0076L91JM,"Classic, progressive, spacious sounds reminiscent of early Genesis. Steve Hackett was the main influence in the music of Genesis, Upon his and Pete Gabriel's departure Genesis fell under the leadership of Phil Collins who steered the group away from psychedelic prog rock to commercial pop, eventually ruining the band's credentials. I have not even bothered to listen to anything Genesis has produced later than early 1980's.
Great music by Steve Hackett.",1447804800,,456,5.436619718309859
