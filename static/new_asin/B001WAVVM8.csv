8347542,5,B001WAVVM8,"The Drive By Chronicles takes us into two separate worlds within the same city. After the tragic death of his mother during his birth and his father away at war, Sidewayz (Alvaro Orlando - VH1 ""The Pick Up Artist"") is left behind growing up with his older brother Frank (Kurt Caceres - ""American Family"").

Growing up as orphans, they go on with their daily routine and are forced to support themselves. But, given his current circumstances, and lack of parental guidance, Sidewayz heads in the wrong direction and tries to join with a local gang. His initiation turns sour when he is forced to rob at gunpoint a local merchant, a friend of the family.

Trying to escape his past mistakes, Sidewayz accidentally finds work as a day laborer and finds, little by little, a better way of life. As the weeks go by, his employer, Mr Vanderwyde, grows fond of Sidewayz and promotes him to supervise the other workers around the house. But, a lack of judgement and infidelity of Mr Vanderwyde's wife with another day laborer turns for the worst as Mr Vanderwyde suspects Sidewayz.

After escaping a drive-by attempt from the thugs of his neighborhood, Sideways now faces another enemy he does not know about, and an ending no one would have suspected.

Written and directed by Imagen Award winning filmmaker Kenneth Castillo.",1310860800,2,1318,4.81858407079646
