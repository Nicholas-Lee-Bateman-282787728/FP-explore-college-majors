2771000,5,B000NJXBIG,"After watching the video I wanted to fly to where Diana Haynes works and get a massage session! (I'd do it if it was not an international flight.)

This video is awesome; everything is clearly communicated and 3D illustrations are very helpful. The techniques shown are working very well. Actually, using the techniques shown in this video, I have healed two of my friends in less than a minute (Both of them were not able to turn their neck for an inch).

I have another title of Diana Haynes, called ""Chair Massage"", and it is PERFECT too!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1314057600,14,562,4.656565656565657
2771001,5,B000NJXBIG,The instructions were clear and understandable enough for me to perform the techniques on my friends after having only watched the video a few times. This is important as I have no actual bodywork training and at the time was completly new to the practice.,1305590400,8,256,4.711111111111111
2771002,5,B000NJXBIG,This dvd is invaluable.  I have started using it in my practice and clients are responding quite well.  The instructor is a great educator.  I was so impressed with this video that I ordered her Mastering Chair Massage Video.  I hope she releases more.  I would love to take a CEU with her as an instructor.,1296691200,17,307,4.410714285714286
2771003,5,B000NJXBIG,I am a physical therapist and purchased this DVD to enhance my manual skills. Diane does an excellent job of instruction.  I highly recommend this DVD.  The explanations are great and the techniques are clearly performed.  It is very easy to follow and allows you to implement the techniques immediately.  I have just recently purchase the DVD but have used the techniques on several patients and have gotten excellent results.,1239148800,10,427,5.057142857142857
2771004,4,B000NJXBIG,"I recommend this DVD for students of the massage school.  Very useful techniques, supplemental to Ortho-Bionomy.  I tried it on my clients and many of them got relive from pain especially in the neck area.",1199577600,7,205,4.828571428571428
2771035,5,B000NJXBIG,"loved this video, very helpful.  A great way to work over used muscles.",1412467200,,71,4.461538461538462
2771036,3,B000NJXBIG,This is a great video to use as it is easy to follow.  So glad I bought it. I followed the reviews and glad that I did.,1411344000,,119,3.4074074074074074
2771037,5,B000NJXBIG,"I LOVE this DVD! I have used Diana's techniques already and know that I will use them on many more of my massage clients in the future. I also have her Mastering Chair massage DVD and Love it too, (matter of fact, it's playing now!)
I like that I can watch the DVD's at my leisure to reinforce what I learned while in massage therapy school. I'm an hour away from the school and just starting out my practice, I find the older I get, the more forgetful I get....Having the dvd is a benefit to my memory :O)",1396396800,,506,4.121212121212121
2771038,5,B000NJXBIG,"the instructions are easy to understand and very helpful.

The only negative is trying to locate a specific technique, its frustrating.",1391558400,,135,5.428571428571429
2771039,5,B000NJXBIG,"One of the best massage training videos I have come across. Techniques are clearly explained and demonstrated, with multiple camera angles and anatomical diagrams where necessary. Not only is the DVD good, but the techniques are highly effective and can readily be integrated into different massage modalities. For massage therapists this is important -- you don't want to throw away a lot of stuff you've learnt just to try something new. I find the background music a little annoying, but that doesn't affect the five-star content and presentation.",1388966400,,550,5.261363636363637
2771040,5,B000NJXBIG,This was a gift for my daughter.  She is a massage therapist and is always interested in learning things that will help her clients. She was very pleased with the set,1387152000,,166,4.354838709677419
2771041,4,B000NJXBIG,"I loved this DVD. It was very informative and has given me another technique to use when I have a client that has very tight & tender areas that you can't use DT techniques on. The DVD was well done, with nice break downs, though I wish some of the camera angles had been better so you could see a bit better what she was doing, though her verbal descriptions helped fill this gap. A good investment for any MT.",1371945600,4,411,4.15
2771042,5,B000NJXBIG,"This is the best DVD I've gotten through Real Bodywork. Simply stated, an excellent training tool for any professional therapist. Diane's mastery of the subject matter is unmatched, and she makes a complicated subject understandable. Her mastery of the human body is also compelling and powerful. Furthermore, this DVD has split screen observations on each technique which further helps the viewer understand the movements. This is a high quality effort by a company (Real Bodywork) that has flopped on other DVD's.

This effort is well worth the money. If you are a professional therapist wanting to deepen your understanding of the body by learning release positions then you can hardly go wrong with this astonishing tool.

Positional release has been called other names in its history. Some refer to it as Strain/Counter strain, or Orthobionomy. While I have not compared this effort to others in the field, I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than Diane.

I can see that I will be spending long hours of trail and error trying to use these tools effectively for my clients.

I give this my highest recommendation!",1363824000,9,1125,5.032258064516129
2771043,4,B000NJXBIG,"This instructional aid is concise, to the point and informative. Practicing the various techniques is the bottom line towards success.",1360972800,2,134,5.75
2771044,5,B000NJXBIG,"Amazing video, I absolutely love it! I use positional release in my practice regularly but was having trouble figuring out how to release certain areas of the sacrum and lower back. The instruction is very clear, the video clearly shows the techniques from different angles and Diana's presentation makes the whole thing interesting and fun to watch. I would buy anything taught by her. I got this video for Christmas and I've been glued to it all morning! I plan on eating some lunch and watching it again.... ; )

The only thing I would change would be to add a reassessment of the young lady she worked on for most of the video. I was sad to see that we didn't get witness the structural changes that I know would have been visible upon reassessment of her posture.",1324771200,17,768,4.525179856115108
8178932,5,B000NJXBIG,This is a well done instructional video that demonstrates how to perform this type of manual therapy.,1487980800,,101,5.0
8178933,5,B000NJXBIG,"What a generous and excellent teacher Diana is. I notice that often female teachers seem to be more attuned to communicating in ways that get the point across really clearly. Especially helpful are her ""integration sessions"" which show how she utilizes positional release techniques while performing typical massage/myofascial release sessions. I bought this and waited several months to actually watch it. I realized I was already intuitively doing her general approach, but seeing her do them on camera and describe specific muscle functions relative to common dysfunctional structural and pain patterns was really helpful. She's a great teacher. This dvd is definitely a great investment.",1470873600,,691,5.59047619047619
