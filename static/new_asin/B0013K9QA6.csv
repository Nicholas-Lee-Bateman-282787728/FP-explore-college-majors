3113714,5,B0013K9QA6,"I heard about this series on EWTN Catholic Radio and had heard some of the episodes.  I purchased this for my teens and they actually watched it!!  Teens want to hear THE TRUTH and this is all about TRUTH - honoring GOD, our creator and our bodies that HE has given us.  Short, 30min episodes, questions and answers...not ""light"" and simplistic or full of don't do this, don't do that.  Young people hunger for this kind of teaching.  Go against the flow and purchase this product.",1312156800,9,481,4.546511627906977
3113715,5,B0013K9QA6,"This DVD set pulls together the program.  The team speaks to the youth well, and leave enough to the leader manual for you to follow-up with.  Theology of the Body is a difficult subject to teach to adults, teens are even more tricky.  This program amazed me with the ease of discusion and tangents for the group on such a sensitive subject.

8251514,4,B0013K9QA6,Easy to understand & having young people talk to other young ones makes good sense; the TOB questions at the end are good too.,1421712000,,126,4.291666666666667
8251515,5,B0013K9QA6,"A must watch for all teens. I'm planning on having a sleep over for my daughter's
friend so we can all watch this. A very important message to all teens.",1410480000,,153,4.133333333333334
8251516,3,B0013K9QA6,"Enjoyed the High School Edition More... this watered down version failed to keep my attention as an adult... plan on just waiting to approach our youth at a more advanced age... with this approach, when we can use the other program.",1405555200,,232,4.682926829268292
8251517,4,B0013K9QA6,"I gave it a four because I felt it could've been more in depth. My teens really liked it. So I know it really helped them, but I felt that for the price there should be more. There is some wisdom, however, in the short focused segments because it does stick to the attention span of teens. I would've liked the series to go on further and delve more deeply into the subject. It seemed a little glossed over for something which should cover something so lofty as the Theology of the Body",1404777600,3,486,4.236559139784946
8251518,5,B0013K9QA6,This series is well worth the time and investment.  Teaches great importance of why God created our bodies male and female and the differences.,1391126400,,143,4.958333333333333
8251519,5,B0013K9QA6,"Theology of the Body is one of the most important, yet largely unknown, treasures of the Church. This presentation was perfect for my 8th grade son. It's professionally produced, entertaining, funny, and kept his attention. It also does an excellent job explaining the Church's complex teachings on the nature of self, our purpose in the world, gender, love, family life, and sex. The message is positive and encouraging. Every middle school youth group and Catholic school in the U.S. should own a copy.",1389225600,,504,5.0843373493975905
8251520,5,B0013K9QA6,"Awesome DVDs!! I have 3 girls and we are watching them in a teen group, with friends. They talk about real issues and do not beat around the bush. I would recommend for all Catholic Teens!",1381190400,,188,4.25
8251521,5,B0013K9QA6,Great series for MIddle School kids to become conforttable with their bodies and what respecting the bodies of others means.,1376006400,,124,5.25

8251523,5,B0013K9QA6,This DVD is going to Africa for the youth.  This is a very unique presentation and will be used wisely.  Something that would be helpful for other youth groups anywhere.,1323129600,3,169,4.6
