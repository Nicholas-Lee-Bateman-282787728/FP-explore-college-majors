8517223,2,B007I1TGK4,"Melanie Denholme movies are basically one woman shows. She is in 98 percent of the scenes, and she acts in various stages of dress or nudity. She does have great screen presence, and her acting is pretty decent.  The editing, film construction, direction, and music in the film also is pretty good. In fact the editing is superb from scene to scene.  However my basic complaint with the film is there needs to be more of a plot. Someone acting out various emotions from scene to scene is not enough. How about maybe adding a few cast members too. How much could that cost Even if you had four people with dialog. There is little  dialog in this film. Also the film is pretty short. It may have worked better in a edited version in a tales of terror compilation. I would like to see her in a better constructed film with a good plot, because I think she would do well.",1465344000,,867,4.339506172839506
8517224,2,B007I1TGK4,"The film starts out with a woman who lives in ""paradise"" with her newly wed husband. She meditates quite a bit. Once while meditating she gets bit by an unseen snake and eats an apple. The overt symbolism made he feel that the director thinks his viewers are idiots. At this point she appears to descend into madness, but really she is supposed to be an ancient spirit  ""Nencha?"" come back for revenge against a man's world or something.

This is a low budget film and pretty much a one woman movie. The husband remains off camera for much of the film. She talks to him like she talks to us looking at the camera, which made it a bit confusing. She kills a couple of guys in it, but they both look the same, so it hard to figure out if it was supposed to be the same person or not. The low budget didn't prevent them from shooting with a fish-eye lens which they used at random, just to show us they had one. They did have money to buy a snake skin looking body suit and sheets.

The overall effect of the film directing had me flashing back to those cheaply made acid films of the 60's normally with Peter Fonda or someone with his hair. A great film if you want to watch Melanie Denholme in every scene, eat you heart out George Clooney.

F-bombs, sex, nudity.",1408320000,3,1262,4.224066390041494
8517225,1,B007I1TGK4,"I bought this DVD because of all the positive reviews. I love vampire movies-however,this is not one of them. It was about as entertaining and exciting as waiting and watching paint to dry. To me it was a COMPLETE bore-I could hardly wait for this piece of crap to end. Pretty well a one woman show that really goes down the toilet. I would NOT recommend this garbage to ant TRUE vampire movie fan. Complete waste of money. I think the positive reviews were written by the  makers of this thrash. I did warn you -would be buyers.",1370476800,2,529,4.3979591836734695
8517226,4,B007I1TGK4,"SUCH an original idea!  The transformation of Eve from normal, rather boring lady to badass killing monster should go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.  It's bizarre, but captivating!",1370390400,,225,5.054054054054054
8517227,4,B007I1TGK4,"This IS a weird movie.  But Denholm does SUCH a great job, you're hooked, and the weirdness actually leaves you really wanting to know what could possibly happen next!  Really original movie here.  Creepy and great for a date night in.",1368316800,,235,4.682926829268292
8517228,4,B007I1TGK4,"This is a strange movie, but having said that, it will definitely keep your attention. A friend gave me this as a gift so I wasn't sure what to expect, but after watching I see why she gave it to me. Very entertaining.",1361145600,,218,4.093023255813954
8517229,3,B007I1TGK4,"Melanie Denholme is definitely beginning to grow on me, or maybe it's just a rash.  So why do bad things always happen to pretty girls?  In this case, one snakebite leads poor Melanie down a very dark path involving continuous and seriously sensual writhing, a skill she excels at, along with some effective fem-dom action.  A one-location, one actress tour-de-force, this reminded me a lot of Polanski's Repulsion.  This was a tough assignment, carrying an entire film alone, but lucky for the filmmakers and for us, Melanie is entirely up to the task.",1340409600,,553,4.913978494623656
8517230,4,B007I1TGK4,"Twilight on steroids--this chick is off the hook! All the grown-up vampire lovers out there will enjoy this racy response to the blood-sucking craze. Sexy, scary and mostly a feast for the eyes, this is not your vampire romance flick!",1339113600,,234,4.875
8517231,5,B007I1TGK4,"This movie is practically a one woman show, and is played really well by Melanie Denholm.  Her character, Eve Dark goes from being a good, holistic, spiritual woman to bad ass, scary but hot crazy vampire.  The film is very visual, it will draw you in but there is not much dialogue.  The music, sound effects and arty camera work, along with the engaging performance by Melanie Denholm makes this movie very captivating.  Highly recommended.",1336608000,3,442,4.8533333333333335
