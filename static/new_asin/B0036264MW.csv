4071890,1,B0036264MW,"This movie is anti-Jew, hiding in the cloak of ""Israel is evil - Palestinians are victims"" tripe.  This is a modern-day version of propaganda against the Jews.  Yes, the Palestinians suffer, but it is because their own leadership siphons off any help that should come to them.  Arafat's widow has millions in bank accounts that will never reach the poor people in Gaza.  Sadly, even with their current leader, Abbas (and Hamas), the Palestinians are ruled by a bunch of thugs.

Unfortunately, ""With God on our Side"" is lacking truth - but the excellent production quality packages the deception so well that many will fall victim to its folly.

Our time would be better spent reading the Word of God to see things from His perspective.",1276905600,21,735,4.7936507936507935
4071891,5,B0036264MW,"Outstanding video that all Christians should see. I believe the author was fair-minded in his presentation as he moved us through his paradigm shift. In my view, the film's goal was not so much in pointing fingers but in offering solutions. God's love should be extended to both Jews and Palestinians alike. The Seed of Abraham was the person of Jesus Christ and He is the Prince of peace.  By Scriptural definition, all true children of Abraham are Christ followers, both Jews and Gentiles. Faith in Christ is the unifying factor that can and will bring peace to this region. Blessings to Porter for putting this masterpiece together.",1274054400,13,635,4.87962962962963
4071892,5,B0036264MW,"I watched this documentary last weekend, and highly recommend it for anyone who has any interest at all in the present Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and especially for those who have theological convictions regarding modern day Israel and/or the Jewish people.

One of the features of this film which I greatly appreciated was the space given to Palestinian Christians to share their stories and their perspectives. They are often a forgotten voice in the present conflict. The same is unfortunately true in the world of Christian Zionism, where even Jewish unbelievers are among the favored ones, but our Palestinian Christian brothers and sisters are too often sidelined. One man (Salim Munayer) shared what he saw firsthand in 1948 when Israel became a nation, when his own family members were made homeless along with nearly 700,000 other people. He doesn't share these details with bitterness. Instead, he expresses how he loved the Jewish people prior to 1948, and by the grace of God continues to love them post-1948. Upon watching the film, one gets the sense that there are so many similar stories which could and should be told.

Another helpful feature of the film is an informative section devoted to the history of the land/region of Palestine during the last several centuries. The film's very informative official site provides some of these same details, minus the attractive graphics presented in the film. One learns about the Ottoman Empire, its fall around the time of World War I, the famous Balfour Declaration of 1917, and British-controlled Palestine during the ""British Mandate,"" all prior to 1948. As the film site () states,

""The status of the populations between Arabs and Jews living in the land of Palestine before 1948 is one that is continuing to be debated. While researching for this film, we came across various population numbers and statistics. We have tried to take numbers that most accurately indicated the realities on the ground at that time. The two main things that can be said with little doubt, no matter what numbers you use is that, one, the land of Palestine was not empty when Jews began immigrating back in the late 19th century. Two, there was a majority Arab population and minority Jewish communities living in the land of Palestine before 1948.

Jewish immigration to Palestine grew, especially during and after WW2 and the Holocaust, which saw the systematic murder of over 6 million Jews at the hands of the Nazis. As Jewish immigration grew, tensions between the two communities mounted. However, before that, Arabs and Jews lived together peacefully. It is true that there was Arab migration into the area as Jewish immigration and opportunities arose; however, the idea that Arabs only started to populate the area when Jews made it prosperous is a myth.""

Speaking of myths, some of the theology characteristic of Christian Zionism is discussed throughout the film, but especially during the last half hour (the film is 82 minutes long). The film is not one-sided in this regard, though. Christian Zionists, John Hagee being one of them, are given numerous opportunities to express their views without interruption. In some cases, their views are then refuted by featured speakers in this documentary. In other cases, their specific points are not so thoroughly addressed, though I found myself wishing that they would have been.

The video footage alone makes this film worth viewing. It was fascinating to see the way of life of both Jews and Palestinians in villages, cities, and marketplaces. To be sure, there were heartbreaking moments as well. The suffering and injustices are incredible, and too many are needlessly being made victims, and much more could be said on this. The viewer learns of some disturbing details behind the push to locate settlers in disputed areas, including massive financial support from Christian organizations in America which is enabling certain aggressive activities to continue and increase. Is God on one side of the present conflict, but not on the other? Christian Zionists say ""yes,"" but does the Bible agree? Emphatically, I must say ""no.""

It's my conviction that it's impossible to make a responsible case from within the pages of the New Testament that God maintains any promises for the Jewish people which are not available for all who trust in Christ, not even promises regarding the land of Israel. In fact, unbelieving Jews (and Gentiles) are entirely outside of God's covenant and promises, for these promises are only accessible through faith (see especially Romans 4 and Galatians 3). Nor do I believe that any promises await any future fulfillment exclusively or primarily for the Jewish people, for there really is no Jew or Gentile in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28; cf. Romans 10:12, Ephesians 3:4-6, Romans 9:6-8).

I'd highly recommend also Stephen Sizer's book ""Zion's Christian Soldiers"" as a further explication of the theological issues at stake.

4071895,4,B0036264MW,"With God On Our Side Director Porter Speakman Film and DVD

Screened at Christchurch, Virginia Water on Sunday 28th February. Explains some of the background to the conflict refutes the arguments of Christian Zionism that have taken root in the US and which are also present in the UK.

Beginning with Joshuah Ch 5 (Joshua asks a shadowy figure ""whose side are you on - ours or our enemies"") the film explores the question of whose side we should be on. The answer to the question he poses is by the way - ""neither"". The warrior says he is on God's side, and of course therein lies the rub. If God is on the side of anyone it is on the side of the dispossessed is what this film argues.

However the Christian Zionists strongly disagree. They do believe that God is on the side of the Jews and that the battles of the Old Testament are still being fought for possession of the land.

Christian Zionism is something to worry about becasue it has a strong influence on the influental evangelical movement. Without a strong grasp of either recent history or a nuanced view of the Biblical history CZ offers beleivers the vicarious pleasure of taking sides in what in their mind is a holy war.

Never mind that Israel was founded as a secular state, or that the Bible is full of references to the Jews as chosen to be the bringer of the messiah to the WHOLE world. These CZ's stick to the narrowest and most divisive interpretation of the chosen people as a conquering army and a precursor to the literal kingdom to come of a conquering messiah.

It is in short an imperialistic vision that feeds into the imperial status (and insecurity?) of the US as a world power with a mythic structure that goes with this.

The difficulty for Christians is that significant elements of this story have been bought into by large swathes of the Evangelical church. While I would say that there is a much more nuanced story, and one that is not exclusive in its theology, many evangelical go along with an exclusive view of religious identity in which there is an elect and a damned, however sorry they are about it, this is their reading of the Bible.

Sadly this vision has a long tail, with our own Lloyd George glibly praising the foundation of a state of Israel as being from ""Dan to Beersheba"" and wilfully ignoring the history and geography of the land in the early 20th Century.

At its limited ""best"" Zionism holds a romance for both the Christian's of late Victorian England and in the US today, and aruably a fig leaf with which to cover the church's historic anti-semitism. At its worst it is a macabre and wholly unchristian set of claims that give succour to people who are seeking a saviour who will give them assurance of an exclusive place in heaven and one which for which they are willing to make victims of others.

The film takes a measured but very serious view of this with trenchant views from Salim Munayeer and othera not only in the church such as notable critic of Christian Zionism Stephen Sizer and the historian Ilan Pappe, shown in counterpoint to the views of Zionist proponents of the secular state of Israel and of an vicarious apocalyptic struggle on behalf of the US and the Western world. It also shows young Israeli Jews mobbing the Old City in Hebron and terrorizing the local citizens with chants of ""Death to the Arabs"". They can, the film explains, do this with impunity because if a settler drops litter and debris on the people below their settlement all they can do is seek shelter whereas if they throw a stone back, then the Israeli military who are looking on all the while will shoot them.

We have to take their word for this in the film but the situation is one attested to elsewhere in both films and books. What speaks volumes is when we hear in it that not only the 30,000 local inhabitants live in fear of the 500 settlers, but the Israeli soldiers themselves who protect the settlers are also we are told frightened by them.

Another film recently made by the Amos Trust, Garth Hewitt interviews the Christians who have gone to the Holy Land and Hebron to monitor these acts and they say the same thing.

The extreme views of Christian Zionism are as I say echoed and in my view nourished by the inertia of the church in the UK which tries to tread a middle path between the extremes but which in so doing gives credence to them. This is a result in my view of our inability to tolerate conflict between things that we hold dear. Are the Palestinians sufferings - yes, but its okay becasue its their fault and history is made to fit the story. Moreover these cherished beliefs are less to do with the story of Israel than they are to do with our own story and taming of our own faith so as to make it compatible with our own ease, standard of living and well being. A Jesus that truly sides with the poor, befriends the victim, and consorts with prostitutes and tax collectors is not the kind of Jesus that we really want to associate oursleves with.

So our poor must come in unpoliticised colours, they need to be starving and help-able, preferably African, not vilified and called terrorists. What takes work is unpacking the words and seeing what the substance is. Is Palestinian synonymous with terrorist and Israel with making the desert bloom or are these vacuous but emotive stereotypes to enable us to stay in our comfort zone.",1268352000,40,5375,4.510791366906475

With God on Our Side: Porter Speakman Jr Interview

Porter Speakman Interview from Stephen Sizer on Vimeo.

Porter Speakman shares about his new film ""With God on our Side"" For more information see [...]

""With God On Our Side takes a look at the theology of Christian Zionism, which teaches that because the Jews are God's chosen people, they have a divine right to the land of Israel. Aspects of this belief system lead some Christians in the West to give uncritical support to Israeli government policies, even those that privilege Jews at the expense of Palestinians, leading to great suffering among Muslim and Christian Palestinians alike and threatening Israel's security as a whole.

This film demonstrates that there is a biblical alternative for Christians who want to love and support the people of Israel, a theology that doesn't favor one people group over another but instead promotes peace and reconciliation for both Jews and Palestinians.""

The title for our film, ""With God on Our Side"" was inspired by the verse:

...while Joshua was there near Jericho: He looked up and saw right in front of him a man standing, holding his drawn sword. Joshua stepped up to him and said, ""Whose side are you on--ours or our enemies'?"" He said, ""Neither. I'm commander of God's army. Joshua 5:13-14a (The Message)

We believe this verse is still true today, that God does not take sides with certain people groups, nations or agendas. Rather He is for all people. Throughout history, those who have claimed God was on their side have used it to justify atrocities done in the name of Jesus. We believe once again certain Christians are approaching the people in the Middle East claiming God is on their side in a way that disregards human rights and gives unilateral support to a secular State, elevates one people group over another while using the Bible as justification. We believe there is a better way, a way of justice, peace and love for Jews and Palestinians. One that is inclusive, not exclusive. That is the heart of God.",1267747200,24,2057,4.826704545454546

The creators are liars!!! It clearly is one-sided lying in favor of the Muslims. Just one example of the many distortions: This movie fails to state the truth that in the 1967 War, Israel was surrounded with Enemy countries declaring war against them and complete Annihilation! Over 6 MILLION JEWS HAD JUST BEEN MURDERED DURING THE HOLOCAUST, SO THE JEWS KNEW TO NEVER WAIT FOR ANNIHILATION TO BEGIN BEFORE STOPPING THE DISGUSTING COWARDS. According to International Law, a declaration of war by demanding people evacuate, publishing through news outlets and radio media the intent, is be grounds for a defensive war, as well as, the war weaponry pointed at them across their borders. If Israel had not ""preemptively"" struck the forces amassing all around them, they may have been completely destroyed. And, how about that ""Palestine"" was a thriving populous??? Have you seen the historical documents from Mark Twain, newspapers, photographs? Show me the documentation of those cities without stealing The Palestinian name, which was what Israel was once called. No where in the history of the world was there a ""Palestinian"" people before the term was invented during the Oslo Accords! No these Arabs were squatters. If there is any doubt, how about DNA test them with the surrounding countries? No? The Ottoman Empire was part Hitler's allies during of WW2 and lost- they had no right to claim ANY land, that is why it was partitioned by The League of Nations! The Ottoman Empire exhiled millions innocent of Jews peacefully living among them. The Ottoman Empire stole the Jew's property, harrassed them, harmed them, killed them, and forced them to be refugees. THAT- IS ETHNIC CLEANSING!

4071911,2,B0036264MW,"Near the end of the film, the filmmaker mentioned putting oneself in someone else's shoes.  For him, apparently this means one must not put oneself in the shoes of a Jewish Israeli, because throughout the entire film there is nothing representative of that perspective.  This film is so one-sided that it truly is an incredible work of art.  Filled with convenient historical gaps, key political explanations, and theological misrepresentations, extreme examples of injustices of sub-cultures falsely being shown as being representative of entire movements as a whole, and numerous half-truths which when left alone actually convey lies, this movie is not worth your time.
After watching this movie, one would get the impression that all that is wrong in the Middle East is squarely the fault of Christian Zionism.  Palestinian suffering is real in many ways, but to pin this on Christian Zionism or even the state of Israel is to live in a fantasy.  The simplicity and navet of this view aside, it's sloppy and shows a real lack of discernment as the filmmaker seeks to paint with broad strokes.  While failing to note the particular positive aspects of the demonized view and only noting its negative aspects, the film instead brands the whole view as negative and therefore to be categorically and unquestionably rejected, like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  This is really a shame because such misdirected blame and disingenuousness prevents the real issues from being addressed, and will only serve to further the suffering on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides, which is something we really should care about.",1454457600,3,1631,5.132075471698113

4071914,2,B0036264MW,"As I say with EVERY documentary, the same applies here; I believe if one is to criticize/critique a particular worldview, in the interest of accuracy, there should be interviews of those who hold differing views ""if"" the documentary wants to be accepted as non-biased. I perceive this documentary as biased by that definition. The doc doesn't show the ""good"" the Jews & IDF do to provide & protect ALL Palestinians, even those who'd have them slaughtered. I DO NOT like the demonstrations displayed where some Jews were declaring ""death to Arabs"" & in ANY case this is indefensible behavior. BUT, there is likely in many cases a sincere place within each of their hearts that this hatred has arrived, as is usually with ANY ethnic group/culture. Maybe they've lost loved ones.. ie wives, children, etc.. to the brutal slaughter at hands of arabs?.. just as one example. In either case, I don't believe the majority of Israeli Jews are bigots.. there's too much demonstrated to the contrary. Walls, barriers, laws.. are usually developed in any nation only when ""security"" becomes a valid concern. As for the ""American Family"" that the documentary began by interviewing.. I think they're just plain ignorant. If you want to argue that you once contributed/supported Israel but have now withdrawn from such support because you no longer see yourself concurring with their actions then that's just a blanket condemnation. They could still give/support Israeli's without propping up the government, if you object to that government's actions. Give food, clothing, prayers, love.. to those in need. Remember the Holocaust?? Well.. Remember the Holocaust!! Love the Jew, love the Arab.. love them all.. & never condone violence of any sort on any side EXCEPT when it is a neutral force of good for peace & security such as the men/women of the IDF!

Even before seeing this film, I have been troubled by the idea that Israel belongs to the Jewish people. Sadly, this film did not address more of how the Balfour document came to be, and how it is a document that should really hold no weight at all. It also did not address many of the deeper issues that I am aware of. Nonetheless, the principal idea remains intact in this film: how would YOU like it if someone came and threw you out of your house, segregated you, and forced you to live in a ""ghetto,"" all because they claimed the Bible said THEY should be there instead?

When I watched this film, and I saw the terrible gates and walls, with their coiled barbed wire, I could not help but think of a comparison between the concentration camps of World War II. How can the Jewish people do to others what was done to them? It seems surreal. I would think their experiences in World War II would have made them more compassionate as a people towards others. We are constantly reminded of the holocaust by the Jewish people, and yet it upsets me that they never memorialize the Christians who died during the holocaust too. The focus is entirely on them, and yet they can turn and do something rather like that to another people? They are so obsessed with the fact that they have suffered as a people, that they forget ALL OF HUMANITY has suffered throughout time, not just them.

The Evangelical reasoning is also nonsense. I am glad that I am not an Evangelical, because I have always been taught that the Jews err greatly by not accepting Christ. We love them, certainly, and I have many Jewish friends, but Judaism was fulfilled with Christ. The chosen people are no longer those who call themselves Jewish, but those who are one with Christ. Therefore, to argue that the Holy Land belongs to the Jewish people of today makes no sense, for the true Jewish people of today are the Christians.

It is so sad to see so much suffering over a spot of earth. If God wants one group to have that area, let HIM work it out. Is He not God? Can He not give it to who he chooses with a wave of His metaphorical hand? But to launch wars and drive people out of their homes over it is just so sad. I really feel for the people who are suffering as though they are somehow less than the Jews. I said it and I will say it again: the Jewish people are no longer the chosen people. We have no obligation to stand behind them in this ""fight.""

But then I met a Christian who had worked in the Palestinian territories as a nurse for several years.  We became friends and over time she told me what she had witnessed over there. I was shocked by what she told me.  We don't hear any of that on the news in the U.S.
I didn't want to believe her but her description of what she witnessed kept nagging at me.  It wasn't until God led me to pray for the truth about this issue no matter where it led that I looked into it (and studied the Bible more).  God answered my prayer not only concerning the truth about Palestine but about Dispensationalism itself and its relatively short roots back to the 1800s..
This movie is a MUST SEE for ALL CHRISTIANS WHO SEEK THE TRUTH ON THIS ISSUE NO MATTER WHERE IT LEADS, even if it turns out they've been wrong all along, as I found out I was.
Should we not care about the Palestinian Christians as much as we care for all persecuted Christians, Christians whose families lived there for many generations and some dating back to the Pentecost?  Sadly, they are so ignored by so many Christians in America who have been hoodwinked by Dispensational eschatology and neocon talk shows.

4071935,1,B0036264MW,"This film is well produced but is unfortunately overlaoded with many errors.  The entire film is based on untrue statements as a way to show that Christian Zionism is invalid and silly.  One untruth is the entire segment By Dr. Norm Finkelstein who makes the false assertion that the 1948 Green Line is an ""internationally recognized border"" and that Israel was building its security fence on someone else's land.. The truth is, the green line is not ""a border"" and never was ""a border"".  It is was an armistice line.  Even though the 'green line"" has never been ""a border"" it is being used in this film to defame and denigrate Israel as if  the premise had some legal standing.

The other falsehood was proposed by Rev. Stephen Sizer who stated rather emphatically that Christian Zionism is the same as Dispensationalist Theology. That assertion is untrue. Biblical Zionism is based on God's eternal and unconditional promise to the Jews in Genesis ( about 2,000 BCE)  to receive a specific land, the borders of which are described in detail.  God asserted that even if they were scattered, He would bring them back. This promise is repeated over and over in the Holy Scriptures from Genesis to Jeremiah and into the New Testament.  It has nothing to do with Dispensationalist Theology which was a product of a much later time with a theologian name Nelson Darby in the 1800's.
Political Zionism was founded by Hertzel in the 1890's and was based on the idea that the Jews who were then under persecution throughout Europe and Russia  needed a homeland.
The entire film is based on these erroneous pronouncements which leave the impression with viewers that  Israel's claims to the land are rather recent ( 1800's) and that Israel's claims are false claims.

4071943,3,B0036264MW,"Never quite understood those ""Christian"" Zionists who profess that Jewish folk in Israel are ""God's Chosen People.""  How does that square with being a Christian?

Jesus, the Son of God, declared that he is the ""New Covenant.""  The Old Covenant is null & void.

Hebrews 9:15 declares, ""For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that He has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.""

Christians do not abide by the Old Covenant.  Thus, those who declare Israeli's to be ""God's Chosen People"" are not Christians... but something else.

The kingdom of God is open to all who believe.

*********

The new covenant is spoken about first in the book of Jeremiah. The old covenant that God had established with His people required obedience to the Old Testament Mosaic law. Because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), the law required that people perform rituals and sacrifices in order to please God and remain in His grace. The prophet Jeremiah predicted that there would be a time when God would make a new covenant with the nation of Israel.

""`The day will come,' says the Lord, `when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. . . . But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day,' says the Lord. `I will put my law in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people'"" (Jeremiah 31:31, 33). Jesus Christ came to fulfill the law of Moses (Matthew 5:17) and create a new covenant between God and His people. The old covenant was written in stone, but the new covenant is written on our hearts, made possible only by faith in Christ, who shed His own blood to atone for the sins of the world. Luke 22:20 (ESV) says, ""And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, `This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.'""

Now that we are under the new covenant, we are not under the penalty of the law. We are now given the opportunity to receive salvation as a free gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Through the life-giving Holy Spirit who lives in all believers (Romans 8:9-11), we can now share in the inheritance of Christ and enjoy a permanent, unbroken relationship with God. Hebrews 9:15 declares, ""For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that He has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.""",1412380800,,2585,4.5139186295503215

Taking the viewer through the history of the last century in Israel/ Palestine, the question is ultimately answered when rightly handling the Word. Isn't that the solution to pretty much every question?

Here is where you will get all the polarization amongst Christians. There are a couple ways to view the Chosen People. Never mind theological terms. There is the right way and the wrong way. And Christians who actually read the New Testament should recognize the right answer right away because the only people called ""Chosen People"" (e.g. ""you are a chosen people and royal priesthood"") are followers of Jesus. Those in the Old Testament who were true believers were Chosen People - which is why the main issue with Judaism in the OT was that they kept introducing false gods into the culture of the supposed followers of Yahweh. Those that stayed true to Yahweh were the real followers of God.

God is not about race - he never was: remember that the original ""Jew"" Abraham wasn't ""Jewish"" (but actually the exact same enthicity as the Babylonian/Chaldean/what we currently call Arabs around him) or remember the Egyptians who went with the Israelites into the Exodus or remember the non-Jews who became more true followers of God than any ""Jew"", like Rahab or Ruth's mother-in-law. Or if you aren't familiar with those characters simply look at yourself. If you are black or white you aren't ethnic, historic ""Jew"" but you may certainly be a part of the Chosen People if you follow Jesus.

Enough with the blind support for the modern state of Israel using the Bible as justification. God is love and God is justice. And what is happening to His people who happen to be ethnic Arabs is terrible. What is happening to non-believers in the Middle East is horrible. Justice demands that we hold evil accountable. Love demands that we care about the Palestinians, Arabs and Jews.

Since I do believe in the Bible as the only authoritative source of truth, this film was quite disturbing of how they viewed dispensationalism and the theological basis for Evangelical support of the Jewish people and Israel.  Dispensationalism was portrayed as being a theology that holds to a sort of duel covenant; that the Jewish people do not need to believe in Jesus as Messiah to ""go to heaven"".  This is not true by any stretch of the imagination and it is false to say that those of us who believe in dispensationalism as a method of interpreting the Bible hold to this belief.  Believing that the Church and Israel are separate is not the only proponent of dispensationalism; but it is one of the key differences when you are looking at the other side being supersessionist/covenant/replacement/fulfillment theology.

The way the film opens with a devaluation and tacit scorn of the Jewish roots of our faith is off-putting, to say the least.  We as Christians have a debt to the Jewish people we can never repay; for receiving, transmitting, transcribing and protecting the Scriptures for centuries.  Our Messiah was also Jewish and you cannot truly understand the need for a Saviour to come if you do not understand the Jewish roots of our faith.  Yes, there is distinction between the Jewish and Gentile parts of the Body but you cannot discredit the role the Jewish people have played in history due to God choosing them as a nation.

It was not a surprise that the only Jewish people shown in this film were either soldiers with guns or the ultra-Orthodox.  There was also no mention of Islam or terrorism.  If you had no idea about the facts on the ground, you would come away thinking that most Palestinians are Christians who are being wrongly oppressed by the Israelis.  Only 3% of the security fence is made of concrete and 98% of Palestinians are under civil law administered by the Palestinian Authourity.  To say that they are under military rule is false.  I could go on about each issue that was ""addressed"" in the film but I will run out of room here.  There are so many things, from the history to the current state of affairs that were either false or skewed.

There has been so much suffering on both sides, Arab and Jewish alike.  That does not give anyone license, however, to just spout falsehood and paint false pictures of any conflict.  To say I was disappointed and disgusted by the misrepresentation of my reasons for supporting the state of Israel as a Christian is an understatement.  I constantly pray for the peace of Jerusalem and all of those who live there.  I pray for peace and that the Palestinians would have a state of their own so that they are able to determine for themselves the way they will go.

4071964,4,B0036264MW,"I watched this movie in Jerusalem after spending over 4 weeks in Israel.  I first came into the middle east having only a basic knowledge of the conflict.  I read and reread Harms & Ferry's Introduction to the Palestine Israel Conflict (2008). During my time here, I've been able to go to meet with all sorts of perspectives.  I've talked to former resistance fighters and idf members who both want peace, seen the major cities in the West Bank, as well as met with idealogical settlers in Hebron, and Ariel.  I've been to many refugee camps and talked with the displaced, as well as had the opportunity to experience Shabat dinners with jewish families and attended some services in a synagogue outside Jerusalem.
 I think the documentary was very well done, with accurate summaries for its main argument. (basically an attempt to make Christian Zionists have another perspective on the conflict, or inform those who side with Israel automatically because America does, that there is another side to the story and Palestinians aren't actually all muslim or  suicide bombers. ( no those don't go hand in hand.)  Although it does lean in favor of the Palestinians, I do believe that it is justified in their argument about justice.  I do think from a personal perspective that many Palestinians are treated unfairly, and the people who flock aid to Israeli Settlers are indirectly responsible.  As a Christian American (notice the order in which I identify with,) it was shocking to hear from the Mayor of Ariel, the 4th largest settlement in the west bank, how supportive christian zionists were toward someone who I really couldn't Identify with.  He doesn't believe that Jesus is who I think He is.  Sometimes I think zionists forgot about Jesus Christ and his radical movement that we read about in the gospels.
Although the movie doesn't mention the 2nd intifada, or suicide bombing which is obviously an issue on some level, it's not completely relevant for the main arguement against christian zionism.  he only gives a  background on the conflict because of his subpoint of, there's a side of the story that most don't hear.  They also don't mention much of the Haulocaust which is an emotional appeal that has been working for decades.  Justifiable?  I'll let you decide for yourselves.

anyway, the movie was great.  i'm gonna buy it and help me tell what I've learned in Israel.

*There's more than just the Israeli view that I've heard my whole life and have assumed, like must Christian Americas.
*There are a lot of Palestinians suffering, and their voice is either not heard, or made out to sound like a terrorist.
*I think Jesus would side with the people who are poor, hungry, and who weep now.
*What's more Chrisitan, or Christ-like? supporting a cause that hurts people, even other Christians, or defending the displaced/marginalized?  you can decide for yourselves what Jesus would do.

I'm not antisemitic, or anti-Israel, or Anti Palestine or Arab.

I love both.  I want peace.

Peace is not the absence of war, it's the presence of justice.

to my fellow Christians:

Let's focus less on the zion, and more on the Christ.

Israel from the Bible is different than the one today.

Christian zionism is also something i know little about.  I know that my dad votes right, and supports israel, but now i question that.  I'm gonna start researching and reading up on aspects of its affiliation.",1302912000,12,3411,4.861351819757366

Mr. Speakman uses this theory and states that the majority of people who support ""Christian Zionism"" support this theory.  This is not the truth.  The majority of Christian supporters of Israel also believe that everyone, including the citizens of Israel, need to accept Christ as savior to be accepted into heaven.  Jews do not get a pass on this because they are Jewish, as John Hagee suggest.  Hagee was criticized because of this and Porter uses this heretical belief as if it was fully accepted by all Christians.

Mr. Speakman seems to accept the replacement theory.  During his film he states he does not believe in replacement theory but in the next sentence he precedes define his theory.  Strangely enough Mr. Speakman's theory is exactly the same as Replacement Theory.  My question is why does Mr. Speakman on one hand state that he does not support the Replacement theory and on the other hand use the definition for Replacement Theory as his own theory?  Why not just tell the truth what you believe?

During this film Mr. Speakman uses Reverend Stephen Sizer as a spokesman.  He is interview about his beliefs and held up as an expert on the Palestine-Israel conflict.  Rev. Sizer has questionable credentials.  He shared a platform with Holocaust denier Fred Tobin in a conference in Indonesia, he has had meeting with Hezbollah clerics in southern Lebanon, he has been sponsored by holocaust deniers and other anti-Semitic groups.  In my opinion Rev. Sizer is a not a non-bias provider of information that Mr. Speakman seems to suggest.

With a quick check in Wikipedia one can discover the misconceptions Mr. Speakman presents.  In my opinion, Mr. Speakman's film can be seem, in the best light, as a propaganda film full of distortions designed to mislead individuals with misperceptions.  His overall goal seems to be political and not informational.  It is obvious that Mr. Speakman is anti-Israel and this film is designed to encourage an anti-Israel point of view.  The problem is that the Palestine-Israel difficulty is real.  The film could have been just as useful if Mr. Speakman was truthful in his presentation.  But I do not think Mr. Speakman goal was to be truthful.  His main goal was to mislead people so they would have the same opinion of Israel that he has.",1302825600,16,3116,4.90057361376673
4071966,3,B0036264MW,"""With God on Our Side"" does an excellent job of criticizing the theology of Christian Zionism. It represents the latter fairly, especially in that it allows one of its chief representatives, the head of the ""Christian Embassy"" in Jerusalem, to speak freely.

Portrayals of the rhetoric of John Hagee, the aggressiveness of Israeli settlers, harsh measures Israel has felt compelled to impose and the voices of Palestinian Christians taken together should motivate American evangelicals to examine uncritical their support of the modern state of Israel and to recognize their need to pay attention to the voices of Arab Christians.

However, the film is weakened by a rather skewed portrayal of the conflict over Palestine. Zionism was bound to encounter opposition from Arabs inside and outside of Palestine in light European betrayal of promises of self-determination after World War I. But relying on Israel Finkelstein and Ilan Pappe as historical authorities weakens the credibility of the overall case because of their tendency to blame the Zionists/Israelis for everything and to give their Arab opponents a free pass. For example, the viewer learns of Ben Gurion's 1937 statement that the Arabs need to be transferred out of a future Jewish state, but hears nothing of the widespread organized violence initiated by Palestinian Arabs in 1936 under Haj Amin al-Husseini (who went on to make anti-Semitic broadcasts from Berlin for Hitler). Also, to blithely equate the wall Israel built in the wake of the suicide bombings of the Second Intifada to the Berlin Wall is at best misleading. It would have been far better to portray the historical and political context in a more balanced manner. Benny Morris, or even Avi Shlaim, would have been a better choice then Pappe but especially Finkelstein, given the latter's tendency to be flippant and disrespectful of those who do not share his radical interpretation of the history of Palestine.",1299456000,20,1946,5.214057507987221

The arguments and conclusions in this DVD cover both sides of the debate, both pro and against Israel's policies.  The guests include ministers, scholars, professors, human rights activists, and concerned citizens.

""With God on Our Side"" provides no sources or references for any of the biased information, statistics, quotations, graphics, or history it presents as ""fact"" and on which it bases its point of view. This alone should cause any thoughtful viewer to question the film's claims and conclusions.

Many of its statements--especially those about Jews, Jewish history, Judaism and the essential importance of Israel to the Jewish people--are inaccurate, unsupported, false and even offensive. Just a few examples:

-The film uses an infamous fraudulent quote attributed to David Ben Gurion that was actually invented by an anti-Israeli activist in 2006, and which has been clearly debunked....

-The film's commentators are the usual anti-Israel and anti-Jewish extremists: Steve Sizer, Ben White, Ilan Pappe, Norman Finkelstein; all conveniently have their books recommended on the film's  website, which is questionable journalistic ethics....

-The film does not interview a single Jewish theologian. Instead, Christian voices mis-define and mis-interpret ""Israel,"" ""Zionism,"" ""Jews,"" and ""Judaism"" (terms which are incorrectly used interchangeably). This is like making a film about the New Testament and not consulting any Christians...

-Whole decades and major historical events are skipped over or consciously ignored: Jewish history in the land, League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, UN Resolution 181, the 1956 and 1973 wars, the intifadas, the PLO, the peace process, etc, etc.

That said, one might be inclined to presume this movie to be a one-sided polemic that serves as little more than ginned-up propaganda. It is not. By including the preeminent voices from all sides of the issue, one is free to weigh all points of view and make up one's own mind--a process which may however require a bold reexamination of one's theological presuppositions. The movie also allows us to see the hardship that US foreign policy has inflicted on Palestinian Christians--something we rarely if ever get to see in American/Western media. The strangest irony of all: War--not peace--in the Middle East is a primary objective of the Christian Zionists, who see the destruction of the Dome of the Rock and subsequent thermonuclear conflagration as a welcome harbinger and necessary step in the return of...the Prince of Peace. And of all the Jews for whom the Christian Zionists profess their love, allegiance, and support--only 144,000 of them will survive while the rest perish in flames, according to their flimsy exegesis of so-called biblical prophecy.

4071985,1,B0036264MW,"If one applies a consistent grammatical historical hermenutic to all of Scripture then they will be Dispensational and a Christian Zionist.

The `replacement theology' church is on the wrong side of the conflict in Israel.

Replacement theology church organizations continue to make rash statements about Israel; call it an occupier; blame it for the Palestinian plight; actively pursue divestments of investments in Israel or in companies that do business with Israel; and side with the Palestinians while never addressing the history of problems perpetrated by the Palestinian leaders, by their own terror groups, or by Arab incitement against the Israelis.

These church groups refuse to address the Palestinian leadership's years of corruption and exploitation, its militancy, its use of terrorism against innocent victims or the fact that Arab leaders are using the Palestinians as pawns in the peace process with the goal of Israel's destruction.

These liberal theologians don't discuss the Arabs' role in the War of Independence in 1948; the Six-Day War in 1967; the Yom Kippur War in 1973; the terrorist bombings under PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat's leadership in the 1990s and the early 2000s; and the ever-growing threat of radical Islam to Israel, the U.S. and the world.

They never mention that Iran is funding Hamas and Hezbollah, two groups that continually call for the elimination of Israel, and they refuse to condemn Iran's leaders' scathing comments about Israel or its development of a nuclear weapon. Instead, they co-sponsored a dinner for Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in New York City in September 2008.

They don't mention the horrendously violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah; or that in country after country in the Middle East, it's Muslim fighting Muslim.

They don't make statements about the abuse of Muslims by their own people; the horrific wars of Iran and Iraq when 1 million people were killed; the Lebanese war and conflict with Hezbollah; or the violent sectarian conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (to name a few).

They also refuse to acknowledge that in nearly every place on earth where there is war or heavy conflict, it's caused by or carried out by radical Muslims.

They have ecumenical meetings and photo ops with imams, even as Christians are being persecuted and killed by followers of Islam due to their faith in Jesus Christ.

This is Scripture in fulfillment.  All the peoples are going to gang up on Jerusalem and the Jewish people and that will sadly include the vast majority in the ""church"".

""I will gather all the nations, And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land."" Joel 3:.2.

""Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.
""And it will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it."" Zech 2:2,3.

 ""Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
""The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed."" Ps. 2:1,2.

This film is the tip of the iceberg.

4071987,5,B0036264MW,"Kevin Miller, co-writer of Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, must have a thing for controversial projects. His latest work, With God On Our Side, is a foray into the heated Israeli-Palestinian debate.

In my view, much of what is published on this topic is both heavily biased (for one side or the other) and/or overly vitriolic. I once asked a Christian friend whom I trust and who has traveled extensively in the Muslim world if there was any ""fair and balanced"" news source/blog on this topic. He was not aware of one. Part of the problem is that each side tends to question the other side's ""indisputable facts"", which makes the subject even more daunting for those of us who have never lived there and don't have a Ph. D. on the history of the dispute(s).

Nevertheless, as Christians, it seems we should exemplify honest and charitable dialogue, even when we disagree. With God On Our Side is a remarkably informative and redemptive documentary which, while critical of modern day Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and even more critical of a strand of Christian Zionism which offers unflinching support for the Jewish state regardless of its actions, doesn't stop there. It seeks to promote mutual understanding and reconciliation between the two quarreling peoples and also raise awareness among American Christians of the plight of Palestinian Christians. This latter aspect is what I found most encouraging. Because regardless of one's view of the nation of Israel, its history and/or its actions, we should agree that Palestinian Christians are squeezed by Muslim groups in their own country, by Israeli strictures designed (at least ostensibly) to ward off acts of terrorism, but which disadvantageously impact all Palestinians, and by a lack of support from the United States. In fact, the documentary helpfully quotes Christian Zionist leader John Hagee making that very point.

Secondly, I think even careful dispensationalists should agree that one's view of Israel's role in end-times prophecy should not make the Jewish state immune to criticism. Even in the hay day of the Davidic kingdom, Israel was not beyond receiving severe discipline from God (e.g., 2 Sam. 24). And most would agree that the first Advent of Christ signified a new era in redemptive history in which the kingdom of God is now advancing invisibly through the gospel gaining adherents from every tribe, language, people, and nation. God's kingdom is thus not within the bounds of any geopolitical nation-state. I would hope that even dispensationalists would be careful in speaking of the Jews as ""God's chosen people"". No Christian I know disputes the uniqueness of the Israeli race (Jacob and his posterity) in biblical history, but apart from individual faith in Christ, every Jew will face the eternal wrath of God (Acts 2:21; Acts 4:12; I Tim. 2:5). The same applies to members of every other race. Surely, as Christians, we should agree on that.

Lastly, we should remember that social justice, while a good thing, should never be elevated above the gospel -- the one gospel which both Jews and Palestinians need (and which unites with an irrevocable bond those from both ethnicities who have embraced it) -- and the one gospel whose implications would lead to peace and reconciliation.

Perhaps my favorite character in the documentary was Palestinian Christian Salim Munayer. Though I don't know him besides what's in the documentary, I was encourage by his winsome humility, grace, balance, and desire to see reconciliation and peace between the two peoples. I wish the film had included an interview with an ethnically Jewish Christian living in Israel to go alongside the commentary from Munayer. It would have likewise been good (and in line with the redemptive, peace-seeking spirit of the film) to hear the Israeli perspective (from local Jews) on some of the subject matter discussed (like the ongoing settlements and the wall of separation).

One of the several takeaways of my visits and study of the issues in Israel/Palestine is that Christians in our USA are killing Christianity in the Holy Land -- albeit unwittingly and under delusion.  But the fact remains: it's not the Arabs, but mainly Israeli policies supported by ""Christian"" Zionists (Hagee et al.), who are driving Christianity out of the Holy Land.

This film is not-at-all anti-semitic or anti-Israel, as one reviewer suggested. Its message is clear in making a plea for Israel's own security and survival as a state. But as the film notes, many Jews are also concerned and appalled by Israeli policy towards the Palestinians and its sickening effect on Judaism itself.

On the propaganda side, it utterly ignores the context of the situation, namely that Jews recently endured the most horrific persecution in the history of the planet, namely the Holocaust, most of which was perpetrated by Christians.  Not just nominal Christians either, For example, Gerhard Kittel whose works are still required reading in seminaries was an active supporter Nazi persecution of Jews. Christian Zionism is, in part an act of repentance on the part of the church. It also utterly ignores Arab racism and anti-Semitism as well as their repeated and horrific aggressive wars against Israel and barrages of other terrorism and suicide bombing.  In this Harrell give the impression of being a spoiled upper-middle class American millennial without a historical consciousness or education.  From the perspective of Biblical studies, it utterly ignores the New Consensus on Paul (formerly called the ""New Perspective on Paul"" but it's no longer new, having come to dominate the field of sophisticated academic NT studies since the early 70's). Namely it states that Paul as well as all the apostles saw themselves as Jews, continued to endorse the keeping of Jewish law __for Jews__, the continuation of all Jewish covenants with God,  but saw Jesus as the means by which non-Jews could be reconciled into Gods family.  One of the professors interviewed alludes to the latter part of the formula but not the former.  That is, he refers to the reconciliation of non-Jews and Jews through Jesus, but not the fact of the continuation of the original covenant.
