3515760,5,B001CQS7LU,"This is a fascinating documentary about Pearl Fryar, a South Carolina man who has transformed his grounds into a dizzying display of plant sculptures. Fryar had no prior experience or knowledge of topiary and his only introduction to it was a brief demonstration at a local nursery. He immediately started landscaping his property with all kinds of evergreens and began training them into stunning shapes and designs with hedge trimmers and chainsaws. Interviews with Fryar's neighbors, friends and family show the influence of his work on the townspeople, young people (he regularly speaks to college students and give tours to grade school students) and tourism for the town. A remarkable man and film, very uplifting!",1232409600,16,720,5.269565217391304

3515766,4,B001CQS7LU,"Pearl Fryar is an extraordinary man, self-made to be sure. The son of a sharecropper, he seemingly has an innate sense about the way plants grow, blessed with a keen, artistic mind. Combined, these talents have made him almost obsessed about turning his modest, 3-acre property in tiny Bishopville, South Carolina into a work of topiary art. Using cast-off plants from a local greenhouse, he creates and beautiful Eden in his backyard. The film is a paean to his efforts, his vision and his effect on his community.

There's a tendency to see Pearl as a sort of backwoods topiary savant. But listen to him speak to college art classes, and you will hear a articulate man who embodies the artistic impulse and inspires students to leave their sketchbooks behind and reach into their hearts. He may not have gained his knowledge from textbooks, but from Nature itself, the source of the textbooks. The film interviews Pearl, his wife and son, neighbors, his pastor and his many friends. The ""best supporting actor"" has to go to the head of the local Chamber of Commerce. Though his feet-on-the-desk, salesy manner might remind some of Uncle Kip in ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" he sems truly appreciative of Pearl and his potential to bring a few more touirists into town.

Played as a fiction, ""A Man Named Pearl"" would have been set as a standard against-all-obstacles story. This film is not so craven as to invent huge villains for Pearl to overcome. The standard demons of lingering racial stratification, self-esteem, community doubt and the clock will have to do. A fine film that shows what human bengs are capable of when given the light, air and space to grow. Kind of like plants.",1224633600,39,1680,4.829861111111111

3515773,5,B001CQS7LU,"This is an awesome beautiful documentary.  Pearl has an High School education and worked in a factory for over 30 years.  His declaration of having yard of the month, spurs him on to create a garden that is spiritual experience for anyone who sees it.  He is a humble man who obviously listens to and is guided by that ""still small voice within"" to create a jaw-dropping inspirational garden that puts this sleepy-town that you don't even know is on the map of the United States.  They say love opens one up to a fourth dimension and becomes your teacher.  He has the same genius of Micheal Jackson, Prince, Steven Spielberg, Michael Jordon,  Rembrandt, etc.  His horticultural skills are beyond amazing; especially, since he uses plants that are discarded as unusable by experienced horticulturist.  It shows miracles are within all of us regardless of your upbringing, economic status, race, creed, or whatever keeps us trapped in our excuses that keep us small.

3515841,4,B001CQS7LU,"I loved this man and his art. I wanted to know MORE about him than what I learned from the movie. I felt myself getting restless with some of the interviews because some of these people repeated themselves.

So many questions!!!

  I couldn't get the scope of the garden from the camera angles and choices.  I wanted to know if he merged rounded bushes with other rounded bushes. Did he have a theme for certain areas? I wanted to know more as to how many years he took on certain bushes for him to obtain the idea/result of what he was aiming towards. The mathematical/geometric angle could have been explored a little more because it was an fascinating tidbit offered after Pearl talked about one angle having to grow to meet the end of the tree. Did he align these trees/bushes into a row of geometric patterns? Or was it all free form thinking?

 I wanted to know why that tall tree was angled (with the branches bare in the middle) the way it was. This tree was so unique and I wanted to know more about it.  Why did he cut some of those trees in long swirly patterns.  What did he see in his mind before he started?  Did he have to get off his ladder often to see the *whole picture* before starting on another branch?

What were all the tools he used?
ANYWAY, this film left me with so many questions as you can see.",1383696000,,1323,4.2730923694779115
3515842,5,B001CQS7LU,"This is a documentary film about Pearl Fryar, a very tall and well-muscled plant-sculpturing topiary artist and ladder athlete who started life in abject poverty and later found himself wanting to move into a Bishopville, South Carolina neighborhood dominated by whites who didn't want him there because of their beliefs that blacks don't take care of their yards.  He managed to move in and became inspired to start gardening with no formal training in art or horticulture.  He began to be noticed when he won Bishopville's ""Yard Of The Month"" award.  He also discovered that he was more than a highly motivated black person.  He had extremely high levels of artistic talent which began to be noticed at higher and higher levels. Eventually, his gorgeous topiary displays triggered topiary efforts by his neighbors, gave Bishopville a major tourist attraction and allowed Fryar to become recognized worldwide as a great plant-sculpting artist.  This high level of recognition also allowed Fryar to become a listened-to philosopher and role model.  The inspiration gained by those who view this documentary would apply to those with interests far afield from topiary art.",1381536000,,1171,5.235294117647059

He puts most younger people to shame with his zeal and boundless energy.  I liked how he had no training and does things that the so called ""experts"" tell him not to do, and it's successful.

One of my aunt's cousins told her about this documentary so she asked me to get it from Netflix so she could watch it. I was going to send it to her directly but for some reason I decided to watch it first. I'm so glad I did. What an absolutely amazing story of a man with incredible talents. I spent the entire time watching this film close to tears it was so beautiful. Who knew a topiary garden could affect me so deeply. Pearl is truly a beautiful soul who also shares his wisdom with the world. Most of this documentary shows Pearl at work in his garden and then there are many people who admire him who share their knowledge of his life. This documentary is warm, magical, funny and awe inspiring. This is a film I can recommend to everyone. It will leave you with a deep impression that Pearl's garden is made with love.

3515860,5,B001CQS7LU,"We just viewed this on the OWN network today and have already ordered our copy and can not wait to receive our copy so that we can watch this beautiful documentary over and over. We also plan to share this with family and friends. This is great for church groups,schools to watch, and communities, etc to gather and watch how a person who is allowed space and time think can transform and transform others. This will also show how one over comes rejection and trials.

We love the fact that Mr. Pearl saw a need and is meeting the need. We wish more schools would focus on the underdogs, ""c"" students and not always the gifted... It reminds me of a book I read that stated the same thing,(the book is by Thomas Stanley The Millionaire Mind and The Millionaire Next Door) how here in America we focus on the gifted and talented.. and never allow individuals to be creative and innovative.

We want to test and test and only take the cream of the top and give them a chance. Well many other countries don't operate in that manner and it is great that someone in American finally is doing something about the way the C students are perceived. Wow being a C student and being looked down on, all the time and told what you can not do, and then turning around running fortune 500 companies shows what and individual can do if given the chance. This DVD will show you what is being done in one town to help individuals that no one else may see as capable of much, but when given the chance rise to the unexpected..

If you love gardening, inspiration, truth, hard work, patience, persistence, faith, dedication, etc this DVD is for you.. And even if you don't you still will walk away touched and transformed...

We are so glad that this DVD was made and hope that more stories of this subject matter will be made.. We also garden with veggies, so this is great for us!

Anytime you meet a person who puts their whole being into creating something beautiful, so much so that others can see and feel close to the supernatural force behind his intent, its refreshing. This man not only has created something special, but unselfishly shares it with others as if its a God-given duty laid upon him to do so.

I hope someday to walk in the garden of Pearl; to meet the man and experience the glory of peace and harmony he's cropped here on earth.  If we could bottle the grace that Pearl must feel while tending to his garden, we'd have a cure for prejudice and hatred that could revolutionize cultural, social and maybe economic differences that keep people separated on this planet.

In gardening as in life, its the pauses and spaces in between the leaves that tell the real story.  Pearl has created space in a place for us to pause and feel the oneness of life.",1291766400,3,963,4.511494252873563

3515873,5,B001CQS7LU,"A wonderful movie about a wonderful man.

Pearl Fryar (and his lovely wife Metra) are two of the sweetest and most truly humble people you'll ever find. As much as I loved Pearl's topiary creations, what really touched me here is the truly unconditional love these two share. You can't fake this kind of connection; look at her eyes when she talks about him, and look at the gentleman he becomes in her presence. The entire world should have someone they love who loves them as much as the Fryars do each other. It's just heartwarming to be in their presence, even via film.

And it's a real treat to watch Pearl's love of nature and gardening transform those who come to view his three-acre slice of heaven, sliced by Pearl himself and certainly watched over by many green angels. The busloads of old ladies and young schoolkids and everyone in between are visibly moved because they can see and feel the love of the man in the plants, and his very individual vision. As some of the gardening experts say at the beginning, he shouldn't be able to do all this...this and that tree don't grow well here...yet there it is, a garden as perfect as Versailles in its own small, quiet way.

I think it works and grows and moves people because of the love so clearly on display. Trees and plants feel that love just as people do, and Pearl's love extends from his family (it's tough to separate his home, wife, and plants, they all seem of an exquisitely peaceful piece) to the people and his community, his church and his God. Yet few churches have the vibrant life and joy that emanates from Pearl's yard, and his very strong intention that it move and soothe others has clearly borne fruit on a level hard to imagine yet easy to fathom. How many small towns can you name that are famous for someone's yard? I can think of only one, and the unforced, sincere love and respect the people of Bishopville show for Pearl make questions of race fade away, and truths about love and determination move happily to the fore.

Pearl is clearly a very wise human being, a wisdom with a special flavor imparted by decades of caring for both trees and people. He says many simple, startlingly accurate things that resonate long after the film is over, and by the end it's hard not to see him as rather more enlightened than most of us. When he casually mentions that he'd never use chemicals in his garden, it makes sense in a way that a long treatise on organics might not. The endless singing of birds suggests that somewhere, St. Francis of Assisi is smiling.

I watch movies not so much to be entertained, but to be moved, informed, and above all transported in some heartfelt way. A Man Named Pearl did all of those almost effortlessly. The gentle jazz score couldn't be more apt (nice job by composer Fred Story, and kudos to Phil Thompson for some lovely tenor sax moments), the film moves with the assurance and ease of a bird flying from tree to tree, the directors remain invisible and keep our hero squarely in the spotlight, the film moves with the assurance and ease of a bird flying from tree to tree, and the whole thing just feels right: unassuming, intelligent and authentic.

I've seen a lot of documentaries about a lot of subjects, and when it comes to movies on great Americans, I'd have to say my three favorites are now Ken Burns' Mark Twain, Ric Burns' Ansel Adams, and Galloway/Pearson's A Man Named Pearl.

Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did, and you'll never forget Pearl Fryar.",1266019200,11,3494,4.527733755942948

It's not for his own vanity; it's for others to enjoy, and it may inspire them to do similar things in their own lives, even if that does not include gardening.

He's won awards and has a huge garden that people come from everywhere to see and walk through.  The movie speaks with friends, his pastor, neighbors and the many visitors that come to see his work.  He does everything himself, often working late into the night.  His creations are really amazing.

3515909,5,B001CQS7LU,"Bishopville, SC is located in Lee County, one of SC poorest counties. Poor in economics but not poor in the richness of their citizens. Pearl Fryar is a remarkable man that has put Bishopville, SC on the map. He started with a small seed of a dream to win ""Yard of the Month"". His creative muse was unleashed with a 5-minute lesson on how to create a topiary with a chain saw from a plant rescued from a compost pile at City Nursery Wholesale Farm (one of seven nursery farms in the US licensed to grow 'Encore' Azaleas.
From one topiary grew two to three to Pearl's entire 2-acre property. His message and philosophy is outlined in his garden with plants that spell, ""Peace, Love & Goodwill"". Pearl is using his creative gift to support and lift up students in Lee County by receiving donations which he uses as scholarships to average ""C"" students in his community. He is a leader in his community with the theory ""it takes a village to raise a child"". Pearl and his wife recognized the challenges young people have in their community with low incomes and decided to do something positive to help lift them up and away from a possible life of drugs and crime. Pearl and his wife are among many unsung American heros living in our backyards. I think every school and library should have a copy of this DVD and share Pearl's message of ""Love, hope and goodwill"" with all students. You will find yourself laughing, crying and filled with inspiration when you watch this DVD. After you watch his DVD check out his website and visit his garden.

Set the record straight--the man named Pearl welcomes people to his garden free of charge; at his driveway, a mailbox stands with a sign, ""Donations"" and Pearl specificially says he does not want anyone to miss seeing his garden because they are unable to pay. His enterprise has nothing to do with hype, popularity, performance, or self aggrandizement.

The documentary does a credible job of showing how Pearl began his work, and the story includes interviews with Pearl's son, and Pearl's wife, who is as wonderful as her husband, in her own way. The only question I had at the end, was how Pearl nurtures discarded nursery plants to such green, verdant liveliness.

I don't think Pearl was reacting to the limited view of some local folks who thought blacks don't keep up their yard, with some sort of passion to prove them wrong. He was following his heart and inspiration to make something beautiful. I agree with the previous reviewer, listen to the presentation to academics and young children by Pearl. It is perhaps his spiritual base or just his goodness that he can see that others can follow their inspiration to create something unique for the world. That's pretty deep. Pearl is an inspiration and the movie is so worthy for young and old folks. Bishopville is much more fortunate then the extended visits Pearls creations have drawn. His gift is much bigger than that.

TITLE: A Man Named Pearl (2006)  G  1:17:57
  Pearl Fryar
  Scott Galloway, Brent Pierson (Directors)

  If you are in the mood for a real-life, uplifting, feel-good story, then this is the documentary for you. It is the immensely inspiring true story of how one man, in his own humble fashion, positively impacts the lives of those around him; and, how he also increases the future economic prospects of the town in which he lives. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.33:1  Color  480p  MPEG-2 (5.2 Mbps)

  Though this movie's image is formatted as 4:3 (1.33:1) on disk, it displays as a properly formatted 1.78:1 image on modern widescreen televisions (which is how I viewed it). I imagine that on old-school 4:3 TV's the image would appear vertically stretched (but, without ANY black bars). In any case, this movie's picture quality, within the confines of the DVD format, is good in most of the many talking-head scenes; and, frequently, it is very good (for a DVD) in the scenes of Pearl's garden. Further, this movie's image features (in those aforementioned scenes of Pearl's garden) dazzling colors, fairly sharp panoramic vistas, and good apparent depth. It also has OK contrast and decent shadow detail (as seen in the scenes of Pearl working in his garden at night). Also, fine detail (for a DVD) is frequently evident in the brighter scenes and in the many close-ups of the plants and decorations in the garden. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has fairy good picture quality; and, should satisfy most viewers.

AUDIO: Dolby Digital 2.0 (Stereo)

  This is a documentary with a large number of talking-heads  so, there aren't ANY gee-whiz sound effects, no deep bass (heck, no bass at ALL, really), no surround activity, and almost nothing outside of dialog (which is clear and easily understood) from the center channel (if you're listening in something like Dolby PLIIx mode, which I did). There are a few occasions in the movie where music is included in the soundtrack, and on those occasions the listening experience comes alive (briefly) because of the well recorded, and dynamic, nature of the music (a version of which is included on the companion CD). Overall, considering the fact that this is a dialog-driven documentary film, its soundtrack has more than acceptable sound quality.
