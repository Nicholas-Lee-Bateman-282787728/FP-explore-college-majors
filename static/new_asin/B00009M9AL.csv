7991791,5,B00009M9AL,"My college cultural anthropology class watched this movie and I also rented it again. I was quite taken with the simplicity of the movie while at the same time it reflected the intense conflicts involved with a moka planning of this size. Ongka states ""I have knocked you down with what I have given."" which I saw as humorous because gift-exchange in their system requires a payback with interest and the moka he presented is going to be very difficult, if not impossible to beat. I look forward to an update, which I hear is now available, as to what has happened since.  Without an economic, anthrpology or sociology background, the everyday person would enjoy the simplicity of the movie and share in Ongka's frustrations.  A must see!
