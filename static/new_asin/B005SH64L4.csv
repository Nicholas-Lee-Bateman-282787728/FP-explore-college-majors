8485060,5,B005SH64L4,"This is a 2-DVD collection of three live shows -- Live 'N' Lewd, The Man Who Thinks He's It, and As Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters. The characters featured are Mancunians Paul & Pauline Calf, Portuguese pop singer Tony Ferrino, safety expert Ernest Moss, former roadie Tommy Saxondale, the world's worst comic Duncan Thicket, and, of course, failed talk show host Alan Partridge.

The DVD extras aren't as good, but still worth a look. The TV mockumentary Steve Coogan  The Inside Story confusingly features more of comedy duo Vic and Bob than it does of Coogan. The Paul and Pauline Calf animations are funny, but don't quite capture Coogan's mannerisms. The excerpts from Coogan's 2009 Australia tour are also funny, but repeat much of the material from As Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters.

I'm a massive Steve Coogan fan (already have The Steve Coogan Collection box set) and was delighted to find this collection. I've watched it over and over again. It's well worth the purchase and a bargain at that. Though there are only up to five stars here, I give it 10 on 10.

[Note: References to British (and Australian) personalities will largely be lost on American viewers. If you are new to Steve Coogan's work, start with Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge.]",1464739200,,1310,4.914027149321267

Great, what else can I say? A-Ha!!!! A must for every Steve Coogan fan!",1338076800,3,240,4.4772727272727275
