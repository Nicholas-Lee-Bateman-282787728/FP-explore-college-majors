8623983,5,B00GJXSMWK,"This is a real treat for fans of Dave, Nick, Billy, and Terry.  I bought this within a few minutes of seeing it available here on Amazon, with my fingers crossed that it would be GOOD or better, and it is.  I'd say it's great or better, and way damn better than the YouTube videos we Rockpile fans have been watching for years now, especially the audio.  But even the video quality is much better than I would have had the right to hope for, given the fact that this was recorded and directed live on 1970s technology.  It's really directed too, not shot on single cam.  I've watched this on a big screen TV and it holds up well in the big picture.  Set list is solid, Nick and Dave trading off songs with Billy getting a few of his own.  It's the closest I'll ever get to seeing this late great band live, and I am happy to settle for it.  (Another review complains there are no ""Seconds of Pleasure"" songs on here but that tour and LP was a year away from happening.  They did a US tour on that in 1980, I wonder why that hasn't shown up on DVD yet?)",1406764800,10,1052,4.092682926829268

ROCKPILE's new release ""LIVE AT ROCKPALAST"" is a classic TV concert that's been restored and released by the great German label Repertoire records in a nice slipcased CD+DVD digipak. It's another great release in this series along with CLIMAX BLUES BAND: Live at Rockpalast 1976, MICKEY JUPP: Live at Rockpalast 1979 and STREEWALKERS: Live At Rockpalast 1975 & 1977......

ROCKPALAST is a legendary `live' music TV show from Germany. It was first broadcast in 1974 and has become a pan-European television institution. It has its own fan club and online forum. There have been many DVDs released over the last few years on different labels, finally making these shows available to fans. The performance here was recorded January 12, 1980 at the Markthalle in Hamburg, Germany and was their only appearance on the show as ROCKPILE (a DAVE EDMUNDS BAND show was broadcast in 1983). The sound and video quality are great and I'm sure the best possible considering the age of the material. All the older shows I've seen from German TV look great, even 'Beat! Beat! Beat!, and that's ancient! If you have any other Rockpalast DVDs, it's similar in quality to those. There are also clips available on YouTube if you want a preview of the contents (don't go by YouTube's picture quality, however)......

ROCKPILE, for all you newbies, was a pub rock/new wave/rock'n'roll supergroup combining the talents of Dave Edmunds (guitar & vocals, ex-LOVE SCULPTURE), Nick Lowe (bass & vocals, ex-BRINSLEY SCHWARZ), Billy Bremner (guitar & vocals, ex-LULU & THE LUVERS) and Terry Williams (drums, ex-MAN). This is an essential release for fans, since the only legitimate ROCKPILE concert release (so far) has been the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-At-Montreux-1980/dp/B0052WBI48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live At Montreux 1980</a>&nbsp;CD. ""LIVE AT ROCKPALAST"" contains the best and greatest hits from both Dave Edmunds' and Nick Lowe's stellar back catalogues, featuring songs by Mickey Jupp (""You'll Never Get Me Up In One Of Those""), Elvis Costello (""Girls Talk"") and Chuck Berry (""Let It Rock"" & ""Promised Land"") along with their own compositions. Strangely enough they don't perform anything from their debut album as ROCKPILE, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SECONDS-OF-PLEASURE/dp/B0001Z3U56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SECONDS OF PLEASURE</a>."" I was lucky enough to see ROCKPILE twice, opening for Van Morrison and then BLONDIE and both times they stole the show! The informative booklet has dual liner notes; in English by Will Birch, an ex- member of their contemporaries THE KURSAAL FLYERS and THE RECORDS who's now a noted British journalist, broadcaster, author and expert on the Pub Rock and `Southend Rock' scenes (of which DR. FEELGOOD were the leading exponents), and in German by noted journalist and broadcaster Uli Kniep. The Track Listing is:
