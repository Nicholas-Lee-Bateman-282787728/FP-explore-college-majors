4165940,1,B003Q7B7BU,"I wasn't overly bothered that the story deviated significantly from the old Phantom; a fresh look or new take can improve source material. Unfortunately, this is a horrible flick. The lead is never believable as a hero...he starts as a whiny b*tch and ultimately (after 90 minutes of dragging out his origin) evolves into snarky. The story is often illogical, the pacing is painfully slow, and the acting by the leads is on the level of a high school play. If you are a masochist and want to watch it, view it free the next time its on the Syfy channel or wait a few months and pick it up in the $2.99 discount bin.",1283299200,15,615,4.356521739130435
4165941,5,B003Q7B7BU,"As more than one person has already explained, yes, it takes a while to get to the real action of ""The Phantom"", but the setup/history/explanation is well worth the wait! I've only gotten to see part of this mini series and am looking forward to the DVD release. (Maybe some good bonus features?)",1280102400,3,296,4.60377358490566
4165942,4,B003Q7B7BU,"The series is decent in that it sets up the possibility of a decent future show. The mini series on Syfy was 4 hours long. It took about 1 1/2 hours to even get to the Phantom. It setups nicely as to why he is the Phantom and who the bad guys are. It pays homage to the history of the Phantom as well. If you would like a modern Phantom this is the show for you, if you have your heart set on the old time Phantom running through the jungles this is not for you. Very modern, I would say the only thing I didn't like was that the new suit in the show appeared to be mostly black with very little purple. Looks like they may have corrected that at least according to the box art of this DVD.",1280102400,17,690,3.8661971830985915
4165943,4,B003Q7B7BU,"This is a relatively decent modern update of the classic serials, and a good followup to Billy Zane's film version. The story has enough twists to keep you guessing, even at the end, and has plenty of potential to be a new series. The quality and scale for this kind of budget was obvious and should be improved if this turns into a series, which it should.",1278547200,8,357,4.343283582089552
4165944,3,B003Q7B7BU,"Kit Walker has come of age but before he can take up the challenge of becoming the 21st Phantom, his adoptive parents have to bite the dust....  The PHANTOM saga continues in this almost 3 hour two-part television mini-series movie with Ryan Carnes playing the legend.  Compared to the long history of dozens of Tarzan films, it has always seemed a Hollywood anomly that the Phantom had to date only rated ONE serial, ONE feature film and an animated TV series.  Finally we are treated to another visualisation of the GHOST WHO WALKS legend, but a somewhat disappointing one at that.  A pity that lessons of the past still seem to not have been learned.  Pause for a moment to consider another film legend - The Lone Ranger who has appeared in a couple of serials, a long running TV series and several movie adventures.  The original TV episodes with Clayton Moore are fondly remembered and his two cinema adventures remain very popular with fans especially the first Lone Ranger film which was almost non-stop action with our hero besting the bad guys but only after Tonto was almost strung up and the Lone Ranger had recovered from being shot.  I mention this because many years later Hollywood tried to revive the legend with an updated Lone Ranger film that was a third of the way through it before our hero appeared in his traditional blue outfit accompanied by the unforgettable strains of the William Tell Overture allowing fans to finally stamp their feet with approval.  But at the end of the day, fans berated the producers for a boring film with far too much delay before our hero appeared.  Fast forward to the current Phantom adventure.  Guess what - our hero does not appear in full uniform and chasing the bad guys until part 2 - YES - THAT'S NOT TILL AN HOUR AND A HALF INTO THIS PRODUCTION !!! (Yawn, yawn, yawn.)  The Billy Zane Phantom film was originally panned for its comic strip production values but is now very fondly remembered for being a fun and faithful rendition of the comic strip hero we have come to admire.  The new PHANTOM fails to generate any of the excitement captured in that film.  The new story is quite boring and when the bad guys open fire, none of them think to take aim at the Phantom's lower face which is the one body part not protected by his new kevlar body suit.  Overall, the best that can be said is that it's great to see the Phantom on the screen again but this half hearted resurrection will do nothing to enhance the legend and the expected luke warm response to this product is unlikely to encourage film producers to invest in a more worthy film adaptation.  To give this an A rating, the A will have to be defined as AVERAGE. And as for the new uniform, we watch movies to be entertained.  I for one, would much rather see an entertaining movie set in the 30's to 50's with the Phantom suited up in the traditional Billy Zane style costume than this new and almost unrecognisable version of a present day hero in a sad and confused drug fuelled modern setting.  Yes, the new Phantom goes through all the motions but is he entertaining?",1278288000,74,3095,4.527827648114902
4165955,2,B003Q7B7BU,"Wow, did this suck. The beginning wasn't bad - actually an interesting take on the Phantom legend...but the effects were total garbage and part 2 of the story just fell apart to the point that I had to force myself to finish it.",1483833600,,228,4.325581395348837

I thought he played a good phantom, im referring to the worst bad guy acting on the planet. Over acting with a goatee and a terrible blonde wig doesn't work. Also the phantom standing in front of bullets?

Saw this on Sci Fi years ago for free thank goodness.",1480636800,,332,4.171875
4165961,4,B003Q7B7BU,"I was skeptical about this rendition of this Phantom because just by looking at the cover, the costume design alone is horrible and looks nothing like the iconic Phantom. That being said, I gave this movie a chance because I do love the character and was curious to see if the story has some semblance of the classic tale. I was happy to see the story does follow the classic enough to be plausible and the actors were mostly adequate in their roles. I did enjoy the watch and would recommend this to others to see, but if the series ever picks up again I hope they make the hero look less like any cheesy vigilante and make him at least look like the Phantom!",1477526400,5,660,4.288

It's not bad but it's not perfect. You may like it , my wife said it was entertaining, I feel a sleep throughout and watched it again. I still find myself watching the 96 version ( a least I know  I have seen it about 50 times) if you like the phantom and the jungle tales you may want to skip it. The actor here and believe me I keep up with actors and heroes they play. I can never remember his name . Billy Zane will always be the phantom.

4165997,3,B003Q7B7BU,"This is a review of the Vivendi Entertainment/RHI Entertainment Blu-Ray edition of ""The Phantom"" (2009).
There are some technical details not properly specified by Amazon:
- This is a ""Zone Free"" or ""Multiregion"" disc, and not a Region A only.
- The movie has English subtitles.
- There are 2 special features (not subtitled): Interviews with director Paolo Barzman (6') and star Ryan Carnes (11')
- The image format is 1'78 enhanced for 16:9 TV sets. (Great  image quaility throughout, no complaints here.)
In regards to the movie in itself, this is an ""updated"" version of the comics character, so fans out there must be aware that a lot of changes have been made to the original Phantom lore.
It is still The Phantom, though, so comics fans should buy this Blu-Ray nevertheless.",1460592000,,781,4.87218045112782

Lots of it is comic book style which makes it even more fun. It sticks to the Phantom dynasty story closely so it doesn't mess with the link to the previous versions.

4166059,4,B003Q7B7BU,"Admittedly, the concept of this up-dated ""take"" on The Phantom, the old-time syndicated comic mystic rider (a more appropriate designation than ""superhero"" for what that comic used to represent), is better than its realisation. Of course, such a junior Phantom would not be the inscrutable travelling sage and adventurer which that figure was in the ""funny pages"" (to which he lent some air of ""gravitas"") in the press of the 1940s and 1950s, as I recall from reading ""The Phantom"" in the newspapers back then as a child and teen. This 2009 film, rather wisely perhaps, lays out new ground in Phantom lore, in imagining some newly conceived, youthful adventures in a more modern setting for that comics hero. One should be able to tell that this is so from the subtitle which the DVD's packaging presents. The full title thereon (here placing a word entirely in capital letters, for emphasis) is ""The Phantom: REIMAGINED and Reloaded"". And reconceived, indeed, is the Phantom whom Ryan Carnes depicts!

As for the 1943 moving pictures serial, which can cumulate nicely into a lengthy movie, the portrayal of the Phantom therein, much closer to his image in the comics, differs almost entirely from the 2009 film. I especially miss Devil, the Phantom's trusty, clever, and valiant canine companion (a wonderfully well trained hound, beautiful German shepherd that he was), playing a significant and endearing role way back then in the 1943 production. Kit Walker, the Phantom in the 2009 movie, whose adventures and exploits are more prevailingly urban, has no animal helpers like Devil (a grey mountain wolf in the comics) or the Phantom's steed, Hero.

As the ""twenty-something"" heir to the family Phantom line, Kip Walker as Ryan Carnes plays the part looks, at this point in his career, somewhat like the boyish Don Johnson at a similar age (i.e., pre-""Miami Vice""), extending to the winsomely sunny smile, but Carnes, already rather physically more robust, is not so downright memorably pretty a lad as Johnson, who was epicene perfection personified. Carnes embodies the youthful Phantom convincingly, clearly having the makings of the character of The Phantom as he would mature, but the entire aura of this once-mysterious figure differs much from the 1943 movie serial, quite apart from the modernisation of the 2009 version's cinematic setting. The other characters suitably fit their parts, dramatically and visually.

While the movie location for shooting it, Montral, simulates the boroughs of New York City very well, the major roles are assigned to American actors. However. the production team and the rest of the cast do Qubec and Canadian cinema proud. I especially enjoyed Peruvian-Qubcois actor Victor Andrs Turgeon-Trelles' brief appearances in both parts of the film as Kip's friend and contemporary, Jordy; Turgeon-Trelles' movies have tended to be ""art films"", so seeing him in this very commercial cinematic mode is an interesting change of pace for him.

The film had its origins as a TV ""pilot"", presumably in both of the two episodes, which are included together on the DVD. In one of the two bonus features included, there was some indication that a television series had been hoped to result, something which did not come to pass. Perhaps if the conception had been for a motion picture from the outset the film would have had tighter construction; as it is the level of interest and forward momentum sag at times. It is rather refreshing, in a way, to see a superhero film that does not rely on spectacular filming technique, C.G.I., and the like, but which proceeds unspectacularly but nonetheless appropriately for a movie in its genre. I'll be watching this DVD numerous times again (on the North American edition of it that I own, i.e. Vivendi Entertainment RH-2830), if only from pride in so many of its good Qubec production values!",1422921600,,3868,5.0579937304075235

4166120,5,B003Q7B7BU,"When I first saw the teasers for Syfy's Phantom miniseries, I was dead set against it. I saw just another unrecognizable revamp of a beloved character with vast history. Trading in the purple tights for a suit that looked more like a sans-mask Guyver? Where was Devil? Where was Hero? Multinational corporate suits for the Singh? But I decided to go ahead and give it a try as a diehard fan of Phantom in print and film. What could I lose but 4 hrs of my life in exchange for a chance to mock another bad revamp of a comic superhero. After watching it, though, I couldn't really mock it. I found I loved the new Phantom as much as the old one.

Considering this isn't our familiar 21st Phantom, but his son, Kit Walker #22, I understood there would be changes, but was still a bit resistant to losing the impression of immortality, the consistent look that makes The Ghost Who Walks that is entirely tied into the classic suit. But realistically, the myth of immortality isn't vital to this Kit. There was a twenty year gap without a Phantom at all after his father died, the Singh were well aware of the truth about the bloodline seeing as they tried to kill little Kit to end it, and in a new, more sophisticated era, the concept of him being immortal just wouldn't be as threatening as it might to villains of a more imaginative time. In the vacuum of an active Phantom, his allies had turned to high tech paramilitary development, so by the time his son was found, they could make a straight switch to a completely new Phantom without worrying that they would destroy a legend most had forgotten about anyhow. This Kit was free to take the best of his ancestors and add his own personal twist, to create a modern hero ready to deal with modern threats.

What really sold me on the 22nd Phantom, though, was Ryan Carnes. I loved Billy Zane's portrayal that hailed back to the classic serials and gave a real sense of the immense history of the character, but Carnes took it a different direction in keeping with a 21st century Kit. He played a completely relatable, totally genuine character, and seeing him bring the Phantom to life is by itself worth the watch. Yes, it takes a long time to get to the Phantom, but you can't help but love seeing how he develops from reckless and self-absorbed Chris Moore into heroic and valiant Kit Walker. If they'd rushed it, we wouldn't really know Kit #22 or why he's not the Phantom we've come to expect. Carnes's Kit struggles with figuring out how to handle an organization his father never had to, with infighting and treachery in his own ranks, how to lead rather than just be the guy in the suit, how to maintain his own identity while honoring the legacy of ancestors he never knew, and how to handle the loss of the only life he understood growing up in his adopted family. Through three hours of film he finally manages to find a balance, to reinvent the Phantom in a believable and relevant way.

If you go in expecting this to look anything like 21st Phantom, you'd probably be better off sticking with Billy Zane, who played the classic Phantom perfectly. If you go in expecting it to be a trashing of an established icon like a lot of current TV and film superhero portrayals, you might be more than pleasantly surprised. The revamp is well-thought out and explained, respects the classic 21st, and yet gives us a modern and relevant hero who is just as strong. And Ryan Carnes makes it work, making a hero that's more relatable than you expect from the genre.",1400544000,8,3517,4.4921875

There were some changes to the canonical locales and places, but all in all, this was still the Phantom.  The original costume was updated, and the Pirates who were the enemy of the first Phantom, have now gone corporate.

This was a wild and entertaining ride, with technological upgrades to the Phantom's costume and weaponry, plus the successor the Phantom mantle is now a Parkour practitioner.  Great mini-series, it's a real shame that the SyFy Channel didn't pick it up. :(",1397952000,,552,4.840425531914893

4166126,4,B003Q7B7BU,"I liked the film even though it had a number of problematic parts and I would have preferred the old phantom rather than a 21st century version of the 21st phantom. What was problematic to me were: The phantom wore a bullet-proof costume but it did not cover the lower part of his face; why would he walk into a hail of machine gun bullets shot by two men; surely at least one round would have hit him in his exposed face. The villains had a mole in the Phantoms hideout, so they knew his location, yet they were searching for him; couldn't they bomb the hideout; even if he wasn't home, it would have killed his assistants and destroyed his supplies. We are shown that his costume gave him enormous power, much more than people have; yet a couple of times he was almost beaten during hand to hand combat. The film repeats several times that the Phantom does not purposely kill people; yet after wounding two men who tried to machine-gun him, he leaves them in a room and bombs it. If I misunderstood and he had killed them rather than wounding them, this is also a contradiction. As with all films about masked heroes, the hero only covers his eyes but most of his face is visible; how is it possible that his loved one would not recognize him. This problem is especially strong regarding superman where the only difference between superman and Clark Kent is that the former has a curl falling over his forehead and doesn't wear glasses. Despite these problems, the film was good, and if there is a series I would watch it, at least for awhile.",1387756800,,1545,4.443661971830986

4166131,4,B003Q7B7BU,"I first saw this mini series on DVD, so I can't say how well it played out in its original airing. My exposure to The Phantom is limited to the 1996 Billy Zane movie, which is most memorable to me for the over-the-top performance Treat Williams gave. Similarly, this attempted relaunch also had a comical villain. That aside, there were some interesting elements; namely the characters directly connected to our new hero. I'm unfamiliar with the lead actor's previous work, but he did well here. I could have seen this becoming a Smallville-esque franchise but SyFy tends to be more restrictive on their products. I should note, one of the more intriguing characters/performances came from Sandrine Holt, who shone even more brightly against a few of the more hammy (short-lived) performances. The mini series was perfectly set-up for launching a franchise and, by the end, I was left wondering how that might have turned out.",1376092800,3,926,4.980645161290322

4166133,4,B003Q7B7BU,"This was a really mini mini-series consisting of two episodes where we were reintroduced to the Phantom, but they took the idea and pushed it to a more modern respect.  The old enemies of the Phantom have grown into a multi-national criminal organization and the Phantom has been MIA for years.  Now the new Kit Walker has been, how shall we say, rediscovered and is brought up to speed and trained to be the new Phantom.
The Producers of the show were more than obviously trying to make are series out of it.  Based on what they had I could easily see that working, however, that does reflect on this mini-series a little too much.  Overall, it's worth a watch just to see how they changed and in some ways didn't change the Phantom that most of us...ok not most, but some of us know and love.

Easy to see what was going to happen though. Also, you can't just watch the movie straight through. You have to watch it in two parts which are on the same disc. Why? Just because that's the way it was shown on TV? This is one purchase I will donate to the local library.",1339545600,5,429,4.0588235294117645
4166165,3,B003Q7B7BU,"I thought this would be series was great fun. Wonderful production values. It was not done cheaply like so many rebots, remakes, etc. etc. etc. At first I could not accept young Ryan Carnes as The Phantom, but when I realized that this was like a sequel and not a remake, I was fine with it. Young Kit (Carnes) was yet another son of the last Phantom. Too bad the last Phantom died because it would have been great to see Billy Zane reprise his role as the Phantom. I am in my 70's and I've been a fan of The Phantom since my Aunt Mary used to read me the comic strip in the Sunday American here in Chicago. So I do know a little of the subject of which I speak. In fact I learned how to read because of my interest in the comics such as Dick Tracy, Smilin' Jack, Invisible Scarlet O'neil, Brenda Starr and Terry & The Pirates.  And before I go on with my review, let me say that, that outfit the the new Phantom had has got to go. It's terrible. Too bulky, terrible headpiece. I don't know what they were thinking with that terrible outfit. And you couldn't even see if it was really purple! What were they thinking-an Iron Man type outfit? They can make fun of the spandex outfit all they want , but that was The Phantom. Billy Zane looked great in that original Phantom suit. And that silly outfit Kit was in was not really The Phantom. Just another Super Hero jumping from roof to roof. And that very complaint of mine may be the reason the two part series was not picked up to go on in a reguler series! No doubt. To bad too because like I stated it was a good story and concept.
And one more complaint (sorry about that) if your a fan of Isabella Rossellini and expect to see her a lot of her in this film, forget it. Isabella has a short role in it. All together she may be in the movie 10 or 15 minutes. And she too had an ugly headpiece. A gawky foolish blonde wig and terrible make-up. Why a great actress like Isabella would take such a role I'll never understand. But when she speaks you can close your eyes and hear the voice of her Morher Ingrid Bergaan. Who in my humble opinion was one of the greats in The Glory Days of Hollywood.
The colors in this film are gorgious. Sharp & clear. And the acting is some of the best I've seen. And the new young Phantom is a good interesting actor and very youthfully good looking. I sincerly hope Ryan Carnes makes it. He's got the looks and talent. And in the 'Glory Days  he would be a big star. Well the film was made a couple of years aga and I didn't even know it existed until I seen it advertised on Amazon. Well that's my humble review and if anyone would like to drop ma an email, fine.  robert,anderson110@comcast,net",1321574400,4,2681,4.161849710982659

Ever since Tim Burton's Batman most superhero costumes are all black or non-existent, this one is both. How would the new Phantom continue the legend of, ""The Ghost Who Walks"" without the uniform? The concept of the super-powered suit isn't all that bad, the Phantom did add new technology to his arsenal as times changed, but make it look like the Phantom. When the classic suit in the case was revealed I thought, ""COOL"" the new Phantom character ridiculed it. I'll take the Zane version over this junk any day.",1296864000,23,657,4.823008849557522
4166173,3,B003Q7B7BU,"After reading the reviews from people who watched this on Syfy, I was frightened.  I thought one of my favorite characters was going to be raped by writers who thought they could make a completely awesome new school movie by ignoring the original groundwork.  As a huge fan of the Phantom (and someone who loved and still loves the Billy Zane movie) I felt I owed it to myself to preorder the DVD and give it a chance.

I understand the length of the movie.  The Phantom is an older character and I see why the makers felt the plot needed to be elaborated on for the newer audience.  Great job explaining everything and setting the story.  However, I did not like the futuristic skull cave idea.  The Phantom was a lone ranger with a very few close friends, not with a full military attack center staff.  Also, the suit was a HUGE problem.  The Phantom was meant to be a gun slinger, not a SWAT/James Bond/The Hurt Locker hybrid.  I would have much rather had the original suit.  But  good job explaining the new suit.  ""Your dad didn't like the old suit"", simply enough right?

As far as action, there really wasn't any.  Nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I realize this Kit Walker didn't have his entire childhood to train, but Carnes played a very rough screwball of a character that was learning on the job, I felt a little more polish was in order.  No incredible stunts.  Mainly this movie is about explanation.

I thought Ryan Carnes being casted was suspect, but he actually put my foot in my mouth.  For the part that was written, Carnes pulled it off well and I wouldn't have a problem with him playing a future Phantom because he really seemed to get into the character.  Good look for the character and completely capable of playing a role such as this.

I heard this movie was made to test the ground and see if people would like a Phantom motion picture to be made.  Either a new story or a reboot to the Zane  film.  Personally I think they could have done a better job if that was their aim.  Its kind of like Shyamalan's Unbreakable, it is a good explanation movie but nothing that makes you want to see it really develope.  If it does fine, if it doesn't fine.

My suggestion is to pick up the original Zane film and watch it, it is a great movie and what is surprising is how well they pulled it off with a low budget.  There are millions pumped into comic book movies today that can't compare to The Phantom.  If you enjoy the original, pick this up and spend some time watching it.  I would have rated it 4 stars, however I know that this movie strayed far from the original idea of the Phantom.  IMO it was too much new material covered all at once.  While I don't consider it the flop that forums quickly deemed it, I'm not going to say it was a really strong movie.  With the resources that they obviously had, there was no reason this movie couldn't have given the 96 film a run for its money.",1293926400,14,2931,4.3076923076923075
4166184,3,B003Q7B7BU,"I see a lot of reviews on the DVD so I thought I'd comment on the Blu-ray production.  There is a high quality top menu.  You can turn on English (only) subtitles and this is the setup option.  After you play part one, it's back to the menu. Then you can manually decide to play part 2.  Special features include interviews with the star and director and we also have a trailer.  No other trailers are present.  The video is pretty good...HD and wide screen.  The sound is good but only stereo.  I think it is recorded with a 5.1, but only once or twice did I notice a sound that may have come from the surrounds.

The movie was ok, but I felt a bit overwhelmed by the plot holes. One example: the police let the Phantom go when a shooting victim tells them that the Phantom saved his life.  New York cops won't just let a masked and armed man go without even asking for an ID.  This Phantom's support team got a serious upgrade from the Pygmy People.  The Phantom has a Skull Cave with a good looking antique living quarters lighted with electric lights including a chandlier rather than candles.  He has an endless suite of hospital facilities, science labs, computers, etc on the lower levels.  Also, a gym, shooting range, motor pool, and even a cafeteria (but the Phantom can call room service...I'm not making this up).  This was a bit much to shove into Skull Cave.  My biggest problem with the movie (or mini-series as SyFy called it) was the terrible ending.  But I have seen worse movies.

4166189,4,B003Q7B7BU,"This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980's.

Ryan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.

Chris Moore has lost his memory and doesn't know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called ""Flicker"" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.

The movie doesn't have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job. However, if this is it, you might wait until you have 3 hours to kill on a movie that is more carrot on a stick than action.",1286064000,2,1794,4.427272727272728
4166190,5,B003Q7B7BU,"Essentially, this is not for huge die-hard fans of the original Lee Falk Phantom, who like their Ghost Who Walks to be more like the comic strip. While I actually really like the film with Billy Zane (more for its sense of humor than anything else, but does have some really interesting action set pieces), I LOVED this update. The director Paolo Barzman really takes a page from the book of Christopher Nolan in giving a purposeful update to a character that hasn't had the best treatment before by, in essence, rebooting the character of Kit Walker aka The Phantom by giving him a reason to become an avenger of evil, rather than just allowing it to be his destiny rather than his choice. And by giving the miniseries a slow burn, allowing us to understand the beginnings of this incarnation of The Phantom rather than just diving right in and showing us, ""Okay, there's this guy who's The Phantom and he fights piracy and evil wherever he finds it.""

I really liked Ryan Carnes also as Chris/Kit. I liked the fact that he already has some training in parkour, but also seems to have certain inherent abilities that are perhaps tied to his specific lineage.

The film overall has some nice surprises, and feels, in many ways very much like Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS. And that is not a bad thing. I feel that it's a little whiny to say that ""Oh, well, we actually have to wait until halfway through before we get to see The Phantom!"". That's akin to being disappointed by waiting about 50 minutes into a feature film before we see Bruce Wayne in the Batman outfit or about 40-odd minutes before Clark Kent first saves Lois Lane.

The bottom line is this: This was an excellent update and will hopefully become a series, and once that happens, I'm sure that will be pretty excellent too.",1284336000,3,1783,4.565625

The immortal Phantom has been unflagging in his fight against the Singh Brotherhood, an international crime syndicate that has ever sought to spread its corruption. Lee Falk's creation lives again in this Syfy Channel effort. But Lee Falk may be spinning in his grave. Hell, Billy Zane may be spinning in his grave.

In his last year at Columbia law, Christopher Moore can occasionally be found on the New York City rooftops, scaling walls, hurdling obstacles, performing back flips, practicing the perilous art of parkour. The law study gets put on hold - the parkour training comes in really handy - when Chris is informed by a mysterious organization that this isn't his real life, that his real name is Kit Walker. That his is the honored bloodline of a legendary globetrotting crime fighter named the Phantom. To preserve the illusion of immortality, the Walker men have always assumed the mantle of the Ghost Who Walks. Chris's father was the 21st in an unbroken line. But is the world ready for the 22nd Phantom? It turns out, no.

Maybe if this were a new character rather than a reinvention of an iconic comic strip character... It's pretty hard to do justice to an iconic figure so linked to its pulp era, especially when there's a determined mindset to bring that icon to a modern day setting. What happens then is you flirt with cheesing off audiences that would naturally gravitate toward this show. Sometimes, when you strive for the hip update, the soul of the thing is mislaid. Tape don't lie.

Warning bells were ringing like a mother. The wonky starts with the Phantom himself as played by Ryan Carnes. My opinion only, but Kit Walker shouldn't look like Dax Shepherd. And unless the costumed adventurer's secret identity is James Howlett, he should stand taller than a garden gnome. This iteration of the Ghost Who Walks doesn't exude a larger-than-life presence. The Phantom threads are radically altered, and while I'm not at all averse to a costume change or modification, the proviso is that it not look lame or uninspired. This new costume is not only lame and uninspired, it makes him look generic, like a fancified member of the S.W.A.T. team. The purple bits are hard to make out. Also, visors and kevlar vests are for wussies.

The movie suffocates under a landslide of poor choices. A horribly banal screenplay. Sluggish pacing. A slow burn parceling of story content. A tendency to drag out scenes. Lackluster action scenes. NOT ENOUGH action scenes. The dreary score. The writers approached this with SMALLVILLE sensibilities, and maybe you can't blame them given the television platform and a modest budget. The internal conflict naturally deals with Chris's acceptance of his destiny. But the external conflict revolves around the very tired plot device of mind control. The Singh Brotherhood has figured out the Phantom's secret and I do like the follow thru thinking the Brotherhood utilizes: cut off the bloodline. However, the fallout is that this motivates Chris to take up the family business.

This three-hour-long two-part mini-series was made with an eye towards an ongoing television series. As such, the Phantom's potential supporting cast is introduced and given time on screen. Thing is, there's an erosion of the overarching mythic elements whenever the camera shifts from the Phantom to track the (relatively) mundane lives of an NYPD police detective and his daughter. The most intriguing supporting character is the beautiful Guran (Sandrine Holt), one of the Phantom's advisors. Meanwhile, Jean Marchand is detached and creepy as the Phantom's mentor, Abel Vandermaark, and damn if he's not one of the good guys. The other beautiful girl in this movie is Cameron Goodman, although she gets the less interesting role of the girlfriend. Isabella Rossellini is also here, and so what?

Another irritating thing is that the film goes to painstaking lengths to establish Chris Moore as a parkour practitioner. However, other than the chase scene from the French murder twins, we barely see Chris performing parkour.

The best scenes concern Chris's time in the jungles of Bengalla as he undergoes training. The rest is boring. The film's parting shot if of the Singh Brotherhood's inner circle chanting their mantra: ""Long live the Singh Brotherhood... and death to the Phantom!"" Judging the arsebottom quality of this mini-series, they may get half their wish. I don't really foresee a television series spinning out of this. Then again, television networks aren't exactly known for their acumen, eh? This incarnation lacks credibility, more the Ghost Who Plods than Walks. I found the Phantom more credible when he was adventuring in the year 2040 or hanging out with Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. In cartoon form.

The DVD's bonus stuff includes ""What the hell was that?"" interviews with Diretor Paolo Barzman (00:06:01 minutes) and actor Ryan Carnes (00:11:03 minutes) - did these guys not prepare for these interview questions? There's also THE PHANTOM trailer, which looks shady.",1284249600,4,5141,5.06855791962175

In this version why does Kit Walker wander about the city with his coat wide open so everyone can see the skull buckle on his outfit? At least the real Phantom had natural strength ( of 10 tigers : old jungle saying) and didn't have to enhance it with an electronic suit. Why does Guran have to be a woman? No offense meant towards women but Guran has always been one of the Pygmy Poison People. Why change that?Lets hope someone will make another film like the Billy Zane version. Please don't turn this new Phantom into a series. Phantom?What Phantom? He may as well be another X-man.",1283472000,43,752,4.41726618705036
