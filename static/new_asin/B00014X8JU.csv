8006574,3,B00014X8JU,"The 17 day celebration in Dayton needed multiple camera crews to cover it.  Here is just one crew with handheld video, one source microphone with no direct feed, and reduced frame rate when zooms and pans are too fast.  We were at the Vectren Airshow for one day, and an entire program could be devoted to those several days alone.  It would have been difficult for one party to attend all of the activities in Dayton, even if adequate promotional material had been available up front.

There is a hodgepodge of segments: opening stadium ceremonies, hot air ballon meet, blimp meet, interview with Wright's niece, various air to air photo businesses, Robinson helicopter, John Glenn signing, F-117, bits from the air show, bits from the hall of fame event, NASA film on the shuttle Enterprise glide tests mixed with an interview with the 747 pilot, NASA film on John Glenn and Mercury, the English Channel glide event, Cirrus Design and Carillon Park  Some are interesting by themselves, but some leave you wanting.  And taken as a whole the film doesn't do justice to the entire event.",1398211200,,1086,4.811827956989247
8006575,3,B00014X8JU,"My husband and myself were very disappointed in this video.  It was more about the celebration festivities of the 100 years of flight.  We thought there would be many more pictures & video of planes and hot air balloons, etc. Much too much time spent on footage of walking around at the celebration.",1359331200,,299,4.622641509433962
8006576,3,B00014X8JU,"This is basically a video of the 2003 Dayton Airshow with some Wright Brothers' history included. There were a few scenes of the airshow, but not as much as I wanted to see. There were a lot of interviews with the Wright Brothers grand-niece; interesting, I suppose, but not what I was looking for. The title seems to indicate that it covers 100 years of flight, but there really is not much on this video to document the real highlights. The best video I have ever seen documenting the true history of aviation was the TV series ""Chasing the Sun"", the videos of which I have never found on the Internet. I would love to get my hands on a DVD set of these videos.",1256947200,,663,4.312
