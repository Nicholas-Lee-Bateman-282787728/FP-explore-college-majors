8669235,5,B00LZVB07U,"Two **GREAT** Spaghetti Westerns.  Not the DOLLARS Trilogy of Sergio Leone, but entertaining, nonetheless.  For those who enjoyed Quenti Tarrantino's ""DJANGO UNCHAINED"", here is your opportunity to hear the song ""His Name Was King"" sung for the first time.",1468627200,,256,5.538461538461538
8669236,4,B00LZVB07U,"American actor Richard Harrison is the focus of this double bill from the curators at Wild East productions.  Harrison starred in many genres in Italy but is mostly known for his Sword and Sandal and Western films.  Before Director Sergio Leone would change the look of the Euro Western with his Dollars trilogy , other Directors were extremely influenced by their American counterparts.  Up first in the bill is a perfect example of this with Director Joaquin Romero Merchant's 'GUNFIGHT AT HIGH NOON' aka 'THREE RUTHLESS ONES' aka 'I TRE SPIETATI' and as it appears in the end credits 'EL SABOR DE LA VENGANZA'- 1963.  Here we have a rancher brutally murdered by bandits leaving his widow and three sons left to swear vengeance on any person who sets foot on their land.  The film follows the three sons as their lives intersect and change due to the tragedy. Harrison plays the lesser role who becomes a US marshal and eventually sheriff who falls in love with a woman who happens to be the daughter of one of his father's killers.  His other brother played by Robert Hundar gets whiff of this news as the film escalates in a brother against brother confrontation leading to the eventual gunfight.  Its all very straight forward without the grit that would become the staple of the Spaghetti Western genre.  With a nice music score by Riz Ortolani and roles by future Euro western stars( Fernando Sancho, Jose Manuel Martin, Aldo Sambrell), its a nice time waster.  Up next is Director Renato Savino's (here billed as Don Reynolds) 'HIS NAME WAS KING' aka 'LO CHIAMAVONO KING' -1971 which is yet another revenge Western with Harrison  swearing vengeance against the Benson gang for murdering his brother and raping his sister in law.  Along for the kharma ride is Klaus Kinski who only takes up about 8 minutes of the films running time but makes the most of it playing a sheriff with an agenda and cameos by Luciano Pigozzi and Vassili Karis.  It winds down with the eventual showdown highlighted by a great score by Luis Enrique Bacalov (traces of his 'DJANGO' score pop up now and then) and gritty photography by Guglielmo Mancori.  The highlight of this set is an excellent 55 minute interview with Harrison which appears to be on the grounds of his estate.  All of his major films are discussed along with a treasure trove of tidbits and facts about the Italian film industry and his take on how he turned down Sergio Leone for the major role  in 'A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS ' aka 'PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI'-1964 and recommended Clint Eastwood for the part. Each film has the Wild East stamp of excellent quality widescreen transfers dubbed in English with picture galleries and original trailers .  All in all, another nice double bill of rare Euro Westerns and worth the price.",1426291200,,2780,4.72463768115942
