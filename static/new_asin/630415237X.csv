7863242,3,630415237X,"This looks to be a straight transfer of the video. Quality isn't any better. If you really love animation & wanna see some good stuff from the beginnings, this one is good.",1348272000,,172,4.40625
7863243,4,630415237X,"I have no idea what the initial reviewer means when she says;
""If you ever played a video game back in the late '80s or early '90s you'll get a sense of what Computer Animation Festival has to offer.""
Oh well.  Anyway, this DVD is pretty decent if you are a die-hard CG fan.  Here are a  few of them described;
The End - My favorite animation on this disc!  The  academy-award nominated animation created by Chris Landreth (who later made  academy-award winning Bingo) turns reality on it's head in a way that  really can only be done with computer animation and motion capture.  Hilarious!
Sleepy Guy - Very funny cartoonish animation by PDI animator  Raman Hui, who worked on Antz.
Liberation and Let There Be Light - These  are two music videos produced by the same animation company for Pet Shop  Boys and Mike Oldfield.  Fairly cheesy animation, but the music mixes very  well, especially in the Mike Oldfield video.
Fluffy - A classic twisted  HASH animation.  It's amazing that this software is responsible such great  animation work as this yet it's so cheap and doesn't seem as widely  known.
Arnie and Birnie - Seriously twisted character animation of a dog  and a pesky flee.
Mercury - Remember the classic BMW commercial showing  a bit of liquid traveling over a dimly blue-light figure vaguely resembling  a nude female body?  Well, this is it!
Still Life - Funny animation of  fruits being attacked on a still life painting by hungry silverware.
Word  Play - Nicely modeled animation by Topix for an Oreo Cookie commercial, I  believe.
Orbit - This is an in-house animation by Softimage and is used  as a tutorial for people learning to use the software.
""Stand By  Me"" - This animation would be impressive if the character was done on  a computer, but no - it's just some guy with makeup standing in front of a  blue screen...",948412800,8,1841,4.651090342679128
