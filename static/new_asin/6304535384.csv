7875502,5,6304535384,"It was a very entertaining episode indeed.
Famke Janssen is very attractive to begin with. As Kamala she entices some miners aboard the ship, as well as Riker, Worf and Picard. It wouldn't be a stretch for any actor to play opposite her although they all played their parts very well.
The ambassador who had escorted her becomes conveniently incapacited by the Ferengi and his negotiating duties are conveniently taken over by the captain. He is taught the rituals and customs by Kamala and in the short period of time together they bond. They both want each other but as the leader of a starship with all the responsibilities it involves, he resists but becomes somewhat shaken at the end. Sort of like a James Bond martini.

The best line comes at the very end when Capt Picard escorts the ambassador (who recovered) to the Transporter Room. The ambassador just before saying goodbye says ""Captain, I just have one question.  I was specifically chosen for this mission because I was highly trained and besides I'm 200 years old.  And even at my age I am still tempted by Kamala and her ways. Working so close, how were YOU able to resist her?""
The pale and heavy hearted captain replied ""Have a safe trip Ambassador"".

I think Picard had to have one of those Cold Sonic Showers after that.",1278547200,,1291,4.649122807017544
7875503,5,6304535384,"It had more humor in it than normally found in a TNG episode: for example, the Ferengis that are brought aboard make total fools out of themselves with lines like ""Peace is good for trade!...unless you're an arms merchant.""  But the best part of the ep is how Kamala keeps shifting her personality for every man she runs into: when she enters Ten-Forward, she turns blue-collar when she meets some miners the Enterprise is transporting, then starts purring/growling seductively at Worf on her way out.  An interesting piece of trivia regarding this ep is that Famke Janssen was the original consideree for the role of Jadzia Dax on DS9, and her character makeup of freckles down the sides of her head would later be used for the Trill species.",986860800,13,743,4.751937984496124
7875504,4,6304535384,"This story lets viewers see an emotional side of the captain that hadn't previously been explored.  The relationship between Picard and the metamorph was well-developed, and this episode contains some fine acting.  We see the kind of woman Captain Picard likes, and how much he really needs her.  Their parting is heart-wrenching for both, and I really felt for them.  The main flaw I have with the episode is the ferengi, who should not have been trusted to roam the ship unescorted.  The metamorph should have been accidentally released in some other way than by the meddling ferengi, whom the crew should not have allowed to be there in the first place.",971049600,7,656,4.821428571428571
7875505,4,6304535384,"Not a lot of action, but it shows a side of Picard's character that makes him the Captain he is.  A metamorph, a being with the ability to become whatever she needs to be to please her mate, has found Picard of interest  to her.  He resist, but since she reflects his interest and desire so  perfectly, finds her irresistable.  But she is to wed the leader of another  planet to end decades of war.
Her final words to him before becoming  another man's wife, the stoney expression on Picard's face as he gives her  to that man as part of his duty....You have to watch this one for yourself.",958608000,12,590,4.3
