1147385,5,7885142523,"This film takes on a pretty difficult topic. Shanghai was/is a polyglot of cast-offs and people who have something to hide. If the screenplay had attempted to really explain how all these people got there and what the forces that control their lives are, it would be a three hour movie with two hours of exposition. This, of course, doesn't happen, but you must pay attention or it's very confusing. Well worth the effort. I consider John Cusack as an actor who delivers according to the material he has to work with. This screenplay was pretty solid and the cinematography was very good....with a few seams of the CGI showing now and again. I cannot understand why there is such a delay on getting a U.S. version out.",1300060800,5,718,4.6171875
1147386,5,7885142523,"This film isn't going to gross hundreds of millions at the box office. It isn't an Avatar or Green Hornet. If you're under 20 and have ADD you probably won't like this character-driven little masterpiece of a thriller. If you don't need an explosion every nano-second, but instead appreciate story twists and acts of betrayal in the story, you'll like this one. All the actors, including some of the best Asian actors in history give a great performance. Even John Cusack was believable in his role, something he's not known to do. I highly recommend this movie. This DVD on Amazon is great. Awesome picture and sound. It includes both the original English audio and the official Mandarin dub with English subtitles.",1294531200,37,716,4.877049180327869
1147387,5,7885142523,"I've never been a fan of John Cusack. But he's in top form here with the rest of the cast including Gong Li (who is finally crossing over in a big way to Hollywood after a couple hits including Miami Vice), Chow Yun Fat, and Ken Watanabe. This is a very well made film -- a WWII thriller that bridges East and West. What made this film special was the Hollywood budget with some of the best Asian actors, and Asian production sensibilities. The depiction of pre-WWII Shanghai is magnificent. Absolutely fabulous movie. A must see. This DVD is also great. It is a dual-layer disc with very high picture quality. It has the original English language track, along with the Mandarin dub viewers in China got to see. If you view it in Chinese, you can see English subtitles.",1294531200,41,769,4.5

I guess the one lesson from this is if your are beautiful and desireable when calamity befalls, you will certainly be saved by some guy if not two.  If you are not, you are most likely on your own.  shark",1479254400,,379,4.28169014084507

1147859,4,7885142523,"The movie's best quality is its setting which is Shanghai (a city in china) during WWII before the US are dragged in and before the city is taken by the Imperial Japanese.  Its a spy thriller that lost me at times (if it didn't then I would have given it 5 stars).  The acting is good and the characters are believable.  The Japanese are portrayed accurately as brutal genocidal savages.  Its also interesting to see the perspectives of WWII were held by the varying characters and nationalities (the movie takes place in a district where all the embassies are, among other districts in the city).",1477180800,,597,4.6571428571428575

John Cusack plays an American intelligence agent investigating the death of his friend, another intelligence agent.  The complex plot is interesting in theory and I generally like Cusack as an actor, but the movie suffers badly because of constant voice-overs (some needed, some not, but either way too many for a MOVIE) and Cusack's low key style when more obvious passion is needed at times.  The idea of making this a film noir instead of a more traditional political thriller is also interesting but doubtful given the material.  This is especially noticeable with the ending.

Don't expect a chick-flickish romantic film even though it deals with love. Gritty, violent but not bloody or intentional; it is necessary as history was even more violent. (Don't worry you will not have to cover your eyes.) Shanghai was a tumultuous melting pot; a precarious cultural and political mix with a crudely sharp but beautiful flavor all its own.

John Cusack and the supporting cast did a great and realistic job, presenting a more serious view of espionage than most movies of this genre/ period in history. The film was top notch all the way; depicting certain a behind the scenes look the true nature of espionage, which is a lot different than the Bourne/ Bond slick sexy ""secret agents"" that hollywood is known for. It seemed dry and a little ""too serious"" when I first started to watch but then it hit hard and it hit on the mark.

1149340,3,7885142523,"If a $50 million movie with a solid international cast of talented, acclaimed (at least in their home countries) actors and excellent production values sits on the shelf for five years before essentially being dumped on home video, you would think it had major problems... a bomb of ""Ishtar"" proportions. But after watching ""Shanghai,"" a noirish pre-World War II drama with aspirations of being an Oriental version of ""Casablanca,"" I wound up being mildly entertained by the cast and the interesting historical context (I confess to knowing little about what went on in China during this time period). Ultimately, however, ""Shanghai"" is less that the sum of its parts and not nearly as good as it could have been, due to an extremely muddled plot.

The movie starts in the fall of 1941, when Shanghai was essentially occupied by the Japanese, although there was a large contingent of foreigners in the city with whom the Japanese still tried to maintain cordial relations. An American agent in Shanghai is murdered, and his friend and fellow agent Paul Soames (John Cusack) is determined to find out what happened. Soames's cover has him working as a journalist, who feigns Nazi sympathies in order to gain access to information about ongoing military activities. He soon winds up in the middle of a hornet's nest of intrigue, as both a Japanese military officer (Ken Watanabe) and a Chinese underworld leader (Chow Yun Fat) try to gain Soames's sympathies. The mobster's wife Anna (Gong Li) also tries to gain his sympathy in a more direct fashion, by getting him into bed. She too has ulterior motives, as shes involved with the local Chinese resistance.

The parallels between Shanghai and Casablanca are obvious, and one thing the two movies share is a terrific supporting cast. Chow Yun Fat, Ken Watanabe, and Gong Li may not be household names in the United States, but they are highly respected. Add David Morse, Hugh Bonneville, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the mix and director Mikael Hafstrom has the right elements in place for a terrific movie. Unfortunately, that overabundance of talent leads to a script thats far too complicated, and the movie eventually becomes a matter of attempting to decipher the numerous changes of heart and allegiance among the main characters.

Director Hafstrom doesnt help matters by starting the movie with a flash forward that pretty much gives away what should be obvious to anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of World War II, namely what an American agent trying to keep track of Japanese naval maneuvers in the fall of 1941 was likely to discover, and how much good that information would eventually do him. In the right hands, knowledge of what was going to transpire might give the movie a greater sense of poignancy. Here, its just a footnote to a overly melodramatic, soap operatic finale.

Visually, Shanghai is a delight, with Cusack looking appropriately rakish in a variety of white suits and tuxes (hes that rare actor whose sex appeal is enhanced in white suits). The film also depicts the lavish opulence of the various embassies and Western businesses and residences, a far sight from conditions in the streets. And the movie also does a good job of depicting the casual Japanese brutality towards the occupied Chinese and the complex nature of international relations at that time. Few in the United States are familiar with that aspect of world history, and Shanghai is a welcome eye opener in that regard.

Ultimately, however, Shanghai feels like a giant missed opportunity. Its interesting to see these actors go through their paces, and Cusack plays well off his co-stars here. But theres more real emotion in five minutes of Casablanca than in this entire movie. For those wanting to see something for free on Amazon Prime, they could certainly do far worse, but Shanghai is never anything more than a well acted but bland period piece.",1460592000,,3903,4.9526717557251905

  shanghai was a very fast paced movie. the stars played their characters well. gong li's character was outstanding...as was her no nonsense gangster husband.  there are always people at the leadership positions (watanabe the commander) that go overboard in any situation. but, having a strong moral code helps make him real. we needed more of jeffrey dean morgan...his part was too short... a good movie with lots of action.",1456617600,,432,5.142857142857143

The other actors who's names I recognized seemed to have very little screen time.  Like most movies that don't catch and hold my attention, I started it then finished it some days (maybe weeks) later.  To its credit I didn't have to start over to remember what had happened in the beginning.  Acting was fair, ending was a bit confusing and I won't say how because it might spoil it for some people.

Its a fantastic addition to my movie library. The movie is set in Shanghai a couple of weeks before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Its a spy thriller.

John Cusack is one of American cinema's unheralded geniuses and Gong Li is without equal.

1154783,4,7885142523,"I thought this film was likely John Cusack's best. It is certainly full of intrigue and great actors. I never recognized Hugh Bonneville as Ben Sanger, as he certainly looked different than in his role in Downton Abbey, but did notice Franka Potente, the fine actress who co-starred with Matt Damon in the first two Bourne films, where she was terrific.

I noticed a character named ""Astor"", the part played by David Morse. I thought the character was in reference to Vincent Astor who was a spy for FDR early in WWII (at about the same time as the setting for this film). However, it could also be a connection to the Astor House Hotel in Shanghai. In any case, it is a tie-in to the Astor family and likely Vincent. So, while the film is fictional, it has some connection to history.

I found it to be an unusual event for Americans and Europeans to be shipped home from Shanghai whilst the Japanese bomb and invade the city after Dec 7, 1941. I would not have enjoyed that trip as the chances of a successful journey would have been slim.

All in all, it was an enjoyable film with intrigue and action with a lot of very well done performances by the entire cast. It is very unusual to find that it was filmed in Thailand and not China. I wonder if it was due to the need to have actual Japanese portray soldiers in Shanghai which could be more akin to rubbing salt in the wounds than anything else. It could have also been due to the tensions between both modern day countries which was beginning to be seen back when this film was being planned and filmed.",1449187200,,1561,4.375862068965517

I can't recommend this film.  The acting is fine, the characters are fine, the photography is good, the special effects are good, but what was the point of it all?  It either went over my head or their doesn't seem to be much of a point.

It only got that third star because of the things that were good.  I won't ever watch it again.  I won't recommend it t to my friends.  Just one more movie to pass on when I am channel surfing in the future.",1448755200,,654,3.931297709923664

1156006,5,7885142523,"There's a whole lot of betrayal going on in Shanghai.  John Cusack stars in this drama set in pre-WWII Shanghai as a Naval intelligence officer posing as a way correspondent with a bent towards the Nazis.  David Morse plays Cusack's immediate superior so convincingly one doesn't think of Morse as any character but who he is.  (That's a tough one to me as Morse always seems to play the same type of character.)

Prior to his arrival his best friend was murdered.  Cusack befriends local crimelord Anthony (Chow Yum-Fat) and his enchanting wife knowing they would likely be useful to him in his endeavor.  The ranking Japanese man (Ken Watanabe) and Anthony have an uneasy alliance as long as each is useful to the other.

This is a well thought out movie in all aspects.  All the actors were accurately cast.  The writing and direction were superb and even the appropriate nationalities were played by appropriate actors of said nationality.",1448409600,5,943,4.84375

1156138,4,7885142523,"It was a good movie, well worth watching.  When I was googling it, I remember flashing by a review which had a line to the effect that the movie proved that John Cusack is just not a good leading man.  So I started trying to think about who would have been better than Cusack.  If it had been Daniel Craig, for instance, he probably would have been a strong leading man, but there would have been expectations that he would beat up the entire Japanese army, which belongs in the fantasy section.  Cusack's character had a more realistic blend of courage, cleverness, and helplessness in the face of the overwhelming march of history.

Gong Li is pretty spectacular.  I kept getting this nagging feeling that she reminded me of somebody, then finally realized that she has an awesomely cute little jaw which can jut out in a convincing show of defiance that isn't so far removed from when Keira Knightly thrusts her own jaw forward.  Now I wish somebody would write a movie co-starring these two beautiful ladies, where the plot requires both of them to jut their jaws out at each other frequently...",1448409600,,1099,4.634020618556701

The movie was very dramatic with rich settings and lots of good acting. I didn't read all the end credits but I have to believe that the movie was filmed in an authentic setting -- there was just too much of everything for it to be a stage setting. I hadn't seen some of the male actors in quite awhile and it was good to see them doing their usual sterling jobs.

Rinko Kikuchi and Jeffrey Dean Morgan clearly have major roles but are barely in the film. That said, this is worth a look. There's some terrific work in terms of the atmosphere and the central performances are all solid. The writing is either a little undercooked or overbaked so while I understand why this missed at the box office, I found it watchable, enjoyable and on occasion a moving thriller with intelligence and passion.",1448323200,,532,4.731182795698925

1156470,4,7885142523,Full disclosure: I am a big fan of John Cusack.  I will watch most anything he is in.  The other reason I liked this movie was because it was a period piece--1940s--so I got to see all the cool things I loved about the 40s.  The sets were impressive; the camera work was inventive and on occasion mesmerizing--if only for a few minutes at a time.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the script dragged a little in some places.  All of the actors did a superb job.  A definite watch for a Cusack fan or a fan of 40s detective/spy stories.,1448323200,,556,4.101851851851852

1156476,4,7885142523,"Interesting story that takes place in Shanghai during the Japanese takeover in WW2.  Admittedly, it does seem like an updated Humphrey Bogart movie with some of the stock characters, but it's engaging anyway. The weak actor in a very strong cast is lead John Cusack who plays himself. He is an American spy sent to discover what really happened to his best friend, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, also a spy. Morgan should have had the lead, not Cusack.  Ken Watanabe is good as the dangerous Kempetai (secret police) major.  Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li are excellent as husband and wife.  Fat is a suave Chinese gangster who plays all sides against each other. He is very much in love with his beautiful wife, well-played by Gong Li.  She is a spy for the Chinese underground and helps the rebels bomb the Japanese forces.  She walks a tightrope and hopes not to get caught.  In the meantime, she and Cusack's character manage to fall in love.  This is a good old-fashioned adventure story with a romantic tinge. The sets and costumes and music are excellent and the camera work superb.  It's a feast for the eyes and really takes the viewer back in time.",1448323200,,1142,4.586206896551724

1157206,4,7885142523,"Pretty solid film, attempting to bring back a kind of ""noire"" to the theater, as well as some honesty about what Shanghai may have been like during World War II. The attempt to bring in an avuncular tone into the film by having John Cusack narrate it was noble in effort. That said, Cusack was surprisingly unable to bring off the tone of a war torn agent - the narration itself sounds exhausted, rather than relaying exhaustion. In the end, it is clear that the director was trying to display the presence of a little humanity in Shanghai at the moment an attack on Pearl Harbor was being revealed. It was an excellent and refreshing attempt, but in the end, it was only an attempt.  We are never given any reason to admire a murdered friend of Cusack, or believe that Cusack is driven by any kind of love. The elegance of the violence is distracting more than artistic, and it's not clear in the end that distraction ran through the entire creation of the film, save Li's performance, which was outstanding. The film is worth watching, and it may age well, but the viewer should be prepared to feel somewhat empty, and not from the artistic merit of the director. A good film. Could have been a much better one. One senses the director forced Cusack into a tone alien to the actor. If you cast Cusack, you need to let him find his path. One get's the feeling Cusack was all but forced to punch a time clock as he stepped in and out of character.",1448064000,,1447,4.399253731343284

1157431,3,7885142523,"Shanghai is one of those oddball films that just doesn't seem to fit anywhere.

A derivative, muddled Casablanca-esque WWII spy thriller helmed by the reasonably accomplished Mikael Hfstrm ( Evil, Derailed, The Rite), who specializes in crime thrillers and high-concept horror, it's not a good film, and it holds little prospect of commercial or critical success.

Perhaps that's why it languished in film-industry purgatory for five years before the Weinstein Co. finally gave it a limited release this month.

Yet. And yet. Hmm. Well, I really liked it, despite my better judgment.

John Cusack is badly miscast as Paul Soames, a Dashiell Hammett-esque American intelligence officer posing as a pro-Nazi journalist in Berlin, who follows a group of German dignitaries for a diplomatic visit to Shanghai.

A remarkable city, Shanghai is on the verge of being taken by Japanese forces, who already control much of China. The city is filled with soldiers, spies, drug dealers, arms merchants, and call girls from every corner of the globe.

Soames is called into action when his friend and fellow spy Conner (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is brutally murdered after stumbling on a piece of information that suggests Japan's fleet may be amassing against U.S. forces in the Pacific.

That's right: Shanghai is about Japan's plot to attack Pearl Harbor. It's October 1941, and virtually everyone in the American intelligence establishment is blissfully unaware of Japan's plans. Everyone, that is, except Conner.

Yet instead of honing in on this promising premise, Hfstrm's film zigs, zags, and careers all over the place with a profusion of fruitless subplots. In one, Soames befriends top triad boss Anthony Lan-Ting (Yun-Fat Chow) while falling in love with his wife Anna (Li Gong). The daughter of a principled Chinese nationalist murdered by the Japanese, Anna is a spy for the city's anti-Japanese resistance force. Another subplot has Soames hunt down Conner's Japanese girlfriend.

Then there's Cusack's interminable voice-overs explaining the plot as the film moves forward (while going nowhere).

Shanghai has a fascinating if outlandish premise, amazing photography, and an amazing cast of international stars who also includes Ken Watanabe, David Morse, Franka Potente, and Hugh Bonneville. Yet it is hampered by weak writing and a badly executed story line.

Despite all its problems, Hfstrm's film has a nostalgic, 1940s film-noir feel that I found attractive. To enjoy Shanghai, you have to approach it not as a completed film in its own right, but as a disparate series of cinematic gestures that evoke a genre that was long gone by the 1950s.",1447891200,,2648,5.251184834123222

Sometimes, you wonder what the story is, but it is supposed to be about a guy who is trying to find who killed his best friend.  The back drop for the story is the Japanese invasion of China and the subsequent horrors accompanying.  Everyone turned in a good performance considering the improbability of events.  For example, our Hero is arrested, given a sound beating and when they can't get anything out of him, they let him go!  The reality would have been an execution at the end of the ""interrogation"".  Also, being a Caucasian American makes our Hero stand out like a sore thumb so ""blending in"" is impossible.  The film does portray the infamous brutality of the Japanese toward the Chinese population.  American and British service men captured by the Japanese are very conversant with this aspect.  When the Japanese soldiers get blown away by Chinese resistance fighters, you can't help but feel that they were justified in doing so.  Again, this is the movies and the horrors of reality for the Chinese was much, much worse.  The menace of the unknown, not really knowing who is friend or foe, makes watching this the more compelling.  Only four stars given due to lack of historical reality on some points.",1447372800,13,1278,4.733031674208145

Sometimes the answers we search for are less complex than we have imagined but lend themselves also to a cause greater than we could have predicted. A very human movie when it's all said and done, with some interesting odds at stake that aren't beaten into the ground but instead used to carry the people through, forcing them to decide.

Covers the turbulent time period of the 1930 in revolutionary torn China- a challenging time period for the short-lived governance of the mainland under the Nationalist government. The international settlement was an interesting anomaly where the government had limited authority if any. The occupation of Chinese territory by foreign powers has not been forgotten, and those who have forgotten will incur the wrath of perceived wrongs by the current communist government. The Chinese people are very sensitive when it comes to territorial issues.

In this movie, its a great intertwining of national, local and international intrigue (politics) with a host of players from the Triads to the Japanese military which jockey for power until the eventual occupation of Shanghai for the duration of WWII.

As explained, China is divided in different sectors which justify the all international casting.  Gong Li, David Morse, Franka Potente, Ken Watanabe, Chow Yun-Fat to name a few.

1158566,3,7885142523,"Produced in English by Harvey Weinstein's company, it's odd that this two year old film has never been released officially in the U.S. Fortunately for me; I found this at a used store for only two bucks. It's the Chinese release of the film but there were English subtitles. The price is worth it although the film is a fairly standard war drama/mystery set in the eponymous city in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. There's plenty of noir-ish spy type confusion and the scenery is well reproduced.

The acting is good, even from Cusack, a guy I'm not sold on. Buying him as a fedora-sporting agent was a bit much, but he avoided his typical Cusack mannerisms. Gong Li plays the wife to mob boss Chow Yun Fat and Ken Watanabe is the Japanese officer in charge of suppressing the Chinese resistance movement. I've yet to see any of those three phone in a performance and they don't do so here, either. I find it interesting if even a bit courageous that Watanabe is willing to play a person with a certain level of moral hesitation given the grim history between China and Japan that still simmers today. He is not the cartoonish evil Japanese military officer and for that the film gets some props because there is a level of moral ambiguity the characters wrestle with, not unlike the characters in another Shanghai-based war movie, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.

Shanghai is a mid-level big production film that harkens back to the noir-ish war films of the 40s. With a cadre of very good Asian actors and some good Yank ones as well, coupled with a quick moving story and some nice cinematic eye candy, it's not a bad movie to spend some time with, especially if you can find it for two bucks.

Probably ""Shanghai,"" directed by Mikael Hfstrm (""Evil"" ""The Rite""), is best described as a film noir, or a story of men and women caught up in the chaos of the pre-war and wartime China. Like many classic noir films, the screenplay (penned by Hossein Amini, ""The Wings of the Dove"") centers around the intricate and conflicted relationships between the characters including the protagonist, who, while investigating the case with his identity concealed, becomes romantically attracted to Mrs. Lan-Ting (Gong Li), wife of the local crime lord Anthony (Chow Yun-fat).

Of course, things are not what they seem, and one Japanese military officer Tanaka (Ken Watanabe) seems interested in what is going on between Paul and Mrs. Lan-Ting. It is a tale of love and intrigue, told against the background of the increasing confusion of the city.

The concept is not new - you may remember Ang Lee's ""Lust, Caution"" - but for all its impressive international cast and beautifully created production and costumes designs, the film is a major disappointment.

For the film's web of love and betrayal (or whatever you name) lacks emotional power that would make you care. Some characters (Rinko Kikuchi's opium-addicted woman in particular) are little better than ciphers. Also, with some obligatory (and dull) ""action"" scenes thrown in, the film suffers from the slack pace and lack of the narrative skills on the part of the director, who seems interested only in filming beautiful shots. Cusack's too frequent voiceovers do not help.

The actors are doing their best, and Gong Li is a real stand-out, but the lifeless film needs something more than noir clichs and connect-the-dot storytelling.",1313971200,10,2068,5.142857142857143
1158570,4,7885142523,"I saw this film while visiting family in India last summer.

Shanghai has never been released to theatres in the US or UK, and it seems a real shame.

This is an exciting thriller, with a good story and some great performances.

It is very film noir, and I would recommend it to people who like that particular genre.",1311984000,,317,4.338983050847458
1158571,4,7885142523,"""Shanghai"" is set in the exotic background of China's great international city of Shanghai--the ""Paris of the East""-- on the brink of Japanese takeover in the weeks leading up to Pearl Harbor. It seems to have been filmed mostly in Thailand, but with CGI and a great ensemble cast headed by John Cusack, Chow Yun-fat, Gong Li and Ken Watanabe, it convincingly recreates Shanghai in 1941. Viewers familiar with Shanghai's wonderful heritage-listed architecture in the Waitan-Bund area, and the former international concessions, will see much that they recognise.

This may be the highest standard and most entertaining international movie production set in Shanghai in the inter-world war era since Spielberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empire-of-the-Sun-Blu-ray/dp/B007KW5N9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empire of the Sun [Blu-ray</a>]. It is a pity that the production could not resolve issues with the Chinese authorities, who at the last minute revoked permission to complete the production in China. It is unclear whether this was due to China's difficulties confronting historical and fictional depiction of its painful past, or some other causes. In any case, the film is listed for release in China.

The success of the film in recreating an impression of old Shanghai seems to owe much to the vision of producer Mike Medavoy, who was born in Shanghai in 1941. It is a romantic spy story, based on a credible premise that people with their wits about them in Shanghai in 1941 might have picked up intelligence about Japanese intentions to attack Pearl Harbor. The premise of the plot is especially credible because, as other folk with an interest in Chinese history will know, the Imperial Japanese Navy used aircraft carriers in both the ""January 28 Incident"" (Shanghai War of 1932) and the ""Battle of Shanghai"" (Aug-Nov 1937). The city was a hotbed of international espionage through the 1930s. By odd and little-known coincidence (maybe - maybe not a coincidence), Nomura Kichisaburo - Japanese Ambassador to the US when Pearl Harbor was attacked - was an IJN admiral with a lot of Shanghai time. Nomura commanded the Japanese forces which attacked Shanghai on 28 January 1932, including the first major aircraft carrier action in the Far East.

The main characters of the film, John Cusack's US Navy intelligence officer, Chow Yun-fat's Shanghai tycoon/crime boss, Gong Li as his wife and a secret Chinese resistance operative, and Ken Watanabe as an astute but conflicted Japanese counter-intelligence officer, are well cast and well played, and appear to be fictional characters drawn partly from composite historical figures. Among the strong supporting cast, Franka Potente has a cameo role as the bored and ignored wife of a German diplomat that is an interesting contrast with her well-known roles in ""Run, Lola, Run"" and two ""Bourne"" movies.

The simple title, ""Shanghai"", for English-language release, relies on the mystique wrapped up in the location name for much of the international audience. The Chinese title is more complicated and colorful: Die Hai Fengyun . The characters literally mean ""espionage sea wind cloud"", with the second character meaning both ""sea"" with a hint of the naval intelligence plot, and the second character of the name of Shanghai in Chinese, and the final two characters, being a compound meaning storm, a synonym for ""fast-moving situation"". The Chinese movie title therefore may be freely translated, unfortunately without the layers of meaning in the Chinese, as ""Shanghai Spy Thriller"", ""Spy Storm In Shanghai"" or ""Naval espionage in the city on the sea"".

The region A Blu-ray release by CN Entertainment is a high-quality video transfer.  I found the English soundtrack level a bit low, but this was easily compensated for.",1306972800,41,3829,5.394648829431438
