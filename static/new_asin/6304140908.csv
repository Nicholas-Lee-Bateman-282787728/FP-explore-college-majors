799331,4,6304140908,"This film covers more of the Moses story than any other film I have seen.  Although there are a few inaccuracies, they are few compared to most Hollywood films and generally don't make any substantive change to the Biblical text.  One problem with the film is that the crowd scenes just don't do justice to the reality.  Scholars estimate there were about 2.5 million Hebrews in Egypt who made the exodus.  I doubt if there are any scenes in this film which show more than 50.  The film could be greatly improved if they could add computer generated people to build the crowd scenes.  This is one thing The 10 Commandments could do well.  The second problem, is that the film just isn't as exciting as The 10 Commandments.  Perhaps that comes from being more accurate.  Overall, it is a good film which does an excellent job at covering the events.",1066176000,7,848,4.562913907284768
799332,4,6304140908,"This movie was well acted out and devoid of the grandiose nature of ""Hollywood"" in general. PROBLEM: there were far more Israelites then is depicted, this IS a MAJOR flaw. You don't begin to appreciate the power of God until, as mentioned so eloquently by 'A viewer from Los Angeles' ""TNT's version reminds us that faith and patience is required as God reveals His plan"" at the Sea. This film only misses the point on this issue alone but unfortunately, it is an important one. In order for people to understand the trials of the Israelites and the repeated disbelief of God's power they would have had to actually show the 'Exodus' as the GRAND event that it really was.
Otherwise it is almost perfect, TNT has shown by far more of the story and gives us a much better than any other single ""Moses"" movie to date.
Combined with all the other films, TNT's version is definitely one NOT to be missed.",1062201600,6,899,4.521472392638037
799333,4,6304140908,"The story of Moses is so complex, so vast, that every portrayal seems to lack something. Hollywood has tried time and again (probably because they get to play with the Red Sea scene each time) to tell this story. Charlton Heston, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley...each does at least an interesting, if not great job of becoming this great historical figure.
I prefer Kingsley's movie's interpretation to the two more prominent movies. Heston is too superhero-ish; and while Fiennes' movie is visually beautiful, it jumbles too much and leaves off midway. Kingsley is a fine actor. You gotta love Gandhi. His Moses movie makes sense as a whole. It takes us through most of the events (a lot more than The Ten Commandments or The Prince of Egypt do anyway). The Red Sea scene is powerful and full of unexpected tension. The death of Moses is quite moving. The only thing keeping it from getting  a full five stars is that there is this one guy who keeps doubting and complaining--no doubt he is supposed to represent the stiff-necked nature of the Israelites. The only problem is that the repeated use of this one actor is almost comical...""Where's the Beef Moses???"" Still, out of the three movies about Moses mentioned here, I give this version starring Ben Kingsley the edge over the other two.",1016496000,12,1291,4.789237668161435
799334,5,6304140908,"This was the first movie from the TNT group that I bought and I was not disappointed. The movie covers Moses' life from his birth to the time right before the conquest.
From a Scriptural point of view, Exodus is the book they follow most. They do not deal with most of the wars during the wandering in the desert and they skirt over some things like Korah's rebellion. Most of the time is spent in building up Moses' encounter with God and the actual exodus from Egypt.
Scripturally, the movie is well done. They had to personify the Israelite people into individuals. Also they make no mention of Moses' children and very little about his wife. Like all movies about Moses, they compress the time frame a lot. They also tone down the size of the Israelites to a few hundred (on screen).
The production is very good. This movie is definitely PG-13. It portrays some sacrifices and war. It may not be appropriate for younger children.",978566400,42,933,4.559523809523809
799335,4,6304140908,"Devoid of the excessive stereotyping and Americanization prominent in The Ten Commandments, Young's work is a long-awaited breath of fresh air.  In this version, Kingsley portrays a Moses much more warm and human, complete  with occasional stuttering and blunders.  The viewer will find in this  character a mortal man facing genuinely impossible obligations.  His  humanness is demonstrated, for instance, during the great slaughter of the  masses following the golden calf event.  Standing bold and firm with his  staff in hand, Moses oversees the brutal, gratuitous killings while  shedding tears in the process.
The beauty of the miracle events in this  movie is in the raw atmosphere accompanying each moment.  These miracles  portray realism rather than magical wonders in a fairy tale, candy coated  with church liturgy.  For example, the burning bush scene in The Ten  Commandments involves a state of piety not unlike that of a modern day  church in Western society.  The setting bears soft lights and prominent  silence.  In essence, Moses enters a holy altar.  Bowing to God, his  movements are rehearsed and orderly, like a skilled monk in a prayer  closet.  Quietly and humbly, Moses moves into repentance and consecration.  When God tells him what he wants him to do, Moses' question of ""Who am  I to do such a thing"" carries a tone of modesty instead of rejection.  But in Young's rendering of this event matters are very different.  Moses  is caught off guard in an otherwise normal setting of sheep, rocks, and  dust when a common shrub a few meters from him suddenly bursts into flames.  Upon investigation, Moses finds himself not so much at an altar but rather  in an altered state.  Yet the rawness of nature surrounding this phenomenon  remains unchanged.  When confronted with his assignment, Moses pleads with  God consistently to reconsider.  He cries out and insists that he is the  wrong man for the job.  Equally impressive is the scene's conclusion.  With  a promise of assurance God gets the last word in, and just like that the  bush returns to normal and the altered state is gone.  No music, no space  gun sound effects, no singing angels.  Moses, still in shock, checks his  surroundings and then himself as if questioning his own sanity.
The  film presents a cast of good actors.  The character dispositions are  slightly peculiar and odd in a way that seems to jibe with the nature of  ancient Middle Eastern culture.  This serves to alienate the audience just  enough to generate a convincing level of authenticity throughout the saga.  Though made on a budget, the movie avoids those tell-tale budget features  that get in the way of enjoying the moments.  I found it both colorful and  poignant, and consider it suitable for anyone, believer and atheist alike.",947376000,24,2799,4.978213507625273
799336,4,6304140908,"Ben Kingsley has to be one of the finest Hollywood--as well as biblical, character actors in the world today. His Moses spans the life of the hero from youth to the old man most people think of when the name of Moses is mentioned.
This film is the best version of the Exodus story to date. It is far superior to 'Ten Commandments', which stressed the spectacular at the expense of the accurate. This TNT version--while not quite as good as 'Joseph', is extremely accurate in its depiction of ancient Egyptian history. It stresses the Egyptian background of Moses' life, and doesn't just portray him as simply Hebrew alone.
How nice to see Moses pictured as a highly trained soldier (which he surely was) in growing up in the Pharaoh's court! Especially novel is the portrayal of Moses' lisp, which could be a very accurate interpretation of the Biblical narrative's 'slow of speech'. While a bit more emphasis could've been placed on the fact that the plagues were specific judgments upon Egyptian gods, the film does a fine job in nearly every other respect.
The next to last meeting between Moses and the Pharaoh (""MY name resounds in all the earth--and I let YOU live""!) is exceptionally well written, and the final meeting is wonderful. Moses speaks volumes in his silence! The parting of the Red Sea is pretty darn good (though the crossing is mysteriously speedy--even for an epic!), and the fact that the Hebrews crossed it 'on dry ground' is an excellent addition which most miss in the Bible, not to mention the film! Great job, here!
The 'pillars of fire' which hold back the Egyptians are depicted as lightning, and this part is a real highlight! The film assumes Ramases and Mernepta are the major Pharaohs of the period. This might cause a little confusion to more conservative believers who place the Exodus earlier (1445 BC), and the Pharaoh as Thutmoses III. It will be especially confusing to 'Prince of Egypt' admirers, since Ramases there is Moses' friend, instead of the Pharaoh-father.
All in all, this is a film well worth watching. Unlike 'Joseph' however, which never had a dull moment, 'Moses' is considerably less interesting after the crossing of the Red Sea. But it does fair justice to the Bible, and the acting is superb. One could hardly ask too much more from Hollywood!",943833600,58,2302,4.78643216080402

799602,4,6304140908,"The Egyptian culture dominated the Mediterranean for centuries. Militarily, economically, culturally, religiously, etc.. The Hebrew influence was near to non-existent. Today Egyptian hieroglyphics are for scholars, the Hebrew alphabet (aleph, beth) is world wide. Egyptian gods are a curiosity, the Hebrew God dominates religious thought. Hebrew law (the Ten Commandments) provides the basis of much of western legal theory.

This drama, introducing the story of the Hebrew release from Egyptian control, provides the background, the explanation, for the initial impulse that started the West on the road we are still traveling (however many detours taken).

Interesting drama. Follows along with the Bible narrative, with a few digressions. Does excellent job of putting the Biblical story in a real place (Egypt), with real people (Moses, Pharoah, Aaron), experiencing real events (plagues of frogs, river into blood, rebellion).

Presents this as history not fantasy. Demonstrates the first Passover and the eating the 'bread of affliction' and blood on the door posts. Includes miracles, opening Red Sea, writing on tablets, manna, etc.

The reaction of Israel makes the movie touching. Moses, Aaron and even God can barely stay ahead of the scoffers and rebels. Pharoah will not humble himself and then Israel doesn't either.

Human nature presented as we still experience it today. Miracles do not produce faith or sometimes even respect.

The development of Moses as a man and prophet is probably the key theme. Shows him growing up in Pharoah's household. Presents him as timid and almost a victim. Kills the Egyptian in a fit of anger to protect Aaron.

I don't think this is precisely the way the Bible explains Moses. Stephen, in Acts, says Moses ""was powerful in words and deeds"". Paul says in Hebrews, he ""refused to be Egyptian, choosing to be mistreated"". He ""looked intently at the reward, continuined steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible"". This is not a description of a timid victim. This is courage born from real faith.

Another detail, the biblical account indicates pharaoh died at the Red Sea. Movie presents him surviving.

However, in this movie, Moses does end up with this profound connection to God. He faith is shown to grow and deepen as Israel passes through the tests of faith. His anguish and then impatient anger is easily seen as caused by the stress of decades of painful leadership. Well done.

Also presents the problem of the Hebrews adjusting to a written law, after living under the rule of pharaoh and their own tribal system. Jethro's firm counsel to appoint additional men with authority is well done!

Movie ends with Moses ascending the mountain and not returning. Joshua leads Isreal into the promised land under the hand of God. Shows Moses work did reach its goal, even if he was not there. Heartwarming. Faith-strengthening.

We have watched many times. Helps narrative come alive.",1447113600,5,2939,5.16421052631579

799692,4,6304140908,"From THE BIBLE COLLECTION comes yet another excellent Bible movie epic, entitled: MOSES. This single, DVD disc, depicts MOSES - the one time, Prince of Egypt; MOSES the slave; MOSES the outcast; MOSES the murderer; MOSES the Prophet, the chosen Man of God. The story of MOSES unfolds with Dolby Digital Surround Sound and full screen viewing, and it is an enthralling depiction of a man to whom the national deliverance of the Lords' People, was entrusted. His brother Aaron was the primary spokesman but with MOSES, was the power of God. Their sister Miriam was given the Spirit of Prophecy and together, all three of them made for a powerful spiritual and leadership, bond (Exodus 15:20 KJV). For  ""...a threefold cord is not quickly broken"" (Ecclesiastes 4:12 KJV) especially, if the Lord, is in it. Very little, theatrical license was taken and this movie version closely follows the Book of Exodus, the second of 66 Books that comprise the Holy Bible. The Red Sea parting was very dramatic and this is the only version of MOSES or any of the Ten Commandments films... that point out in detail, that while in the wilderness - the people, out of fear... rejected talking with the Lord and preferred that MOSES, do it for them. ""Now all of the people witnessed the thundering's, the lightening flashes, the sound of the trumpet and the mountain (of God) smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood afar off. Then they said to Moses, 'You speak with us and we will hear (listen); but let not God speak with us, lest we die'"" (Exodus 20:18-19 NKJV).

I understand that there is always going to be some 'filler' in a movie--some things that are speculative . . . conversations, relationships, etc.  But what I found most disturbing is that this Bible strayed from Scripture when there was no need for it to.  Like the blood that was supposed to go above and on each side of the door frame--in the movie, it was only painted to one side of the door.  (The placement of that blood was supposed to be symbolic of Jesus' blood that was shed on the cross, and from the crown of thorns on His head.)  Or like conversations that did not go as the Bible said.  Etc., etc.  I kept having to say--'well, that's not the way it is in the Bible'.  This is definitely not a movie for anyone who wants an account that stays true to Scripture.  It wouldn't be good for a Sunday school class, or for teaching anyone what the Bible says.

800095,5,6304140908,"This TNT miniseries is arguably the best film portrayal of Moses for biblical accuracy and entertainment value. Ben Kingsley is a bit old for the role at 52, but he plays Moses with a passionate zeal and human fallibility (anger, stuttering, impatience) that is captivating to behold, if not readily sympathetic for younger viewers who may want more action than character development. If too many Bible films offer one-dimensional heroes and villains rather than Biblical figures with real character arcs, Kingsley is the antidote as a reluctant hero who matures from a misfit plagued by self-doubts into a true leader of men who trusts deeply in God despite his lingering flaws.

The other actors are good foils for Kingsley, giving their own nuanced interpretations of the material. Frank Langella and (more briefly) Christopher Lee nail their roles as the two pharaohs of the story, showing stubborn anger and lust for power without descending into cartoon villainy. David Suchet of PBS ""Mystery"" fame offers a richly textured Aaron and Scottish actor Maurice Roeves (""The Last of the Mohicans"") makes a convincing Hebrew foreman who represents all of Israel's doubts and rebellious instincts, even though he's probably the weakest character of the film. Philip Stone, a staple in Stanley Kubrick films, makes a warm and likable Jethro whose character somehow benefits in a grandfatherly way from being just a tad bland.

The film has a few minor downsides. It moves slowly in spots and might have benefitted from including more of the action-packed material (attack of the Amalekites anyone?) from Exodus in its second half, rather than several slow-moving character segments in the desert that are apparently meant to explicate the biblical story. The Amalekite battle featuring the staff of Moses would have been welcome here, emphasizing an important element (the ability to defend themselves) in Israel's journey from slavery to nationhood that is otherwise neglected here. Also, the early CGI special effects are muted despite being very good, making them likely to disappoint younger viewers who expects high spectacle -- i.e. a magical special effects atmosphere for the plagues and crossing of the Red Sea -- from any version of this story on film. Finally, the broad outlines of this story are so familiar that the viewer may lose interest in its straightforwardly reverent approach, which eschews Hollywood style to the point of casting plain-looking people dressed in authentic garb rather than supermodels dressed to attract the eye. For all of these reasons, the film might disappoint kids who have been weened on the self-assured Moses of DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" spectacle and the animated wizardry of Dreamworks' ""Prince of Egypt"" film. It may also disappoint those who want to see an edgier agnostic take on this material, such as Hallmark's dreadful 2006 miniseries ""The Ten Commandments"" and its guilt-ridden Moses (Dougray Scott) who is a one-dimensional nutjob. One may reasonably expect that Ridley Scott's ""Exodus,"" starring the wooden Christian Bale as Moses, will likewise be a disappointment when it hits theaters in December 2014.

Yet the film is sensitive in its emotions, subtle in its themes, and brilliant in its characterizations. Its naturalistic and historical style presents real events with real people struggling and often failing to grow in faith with God's help. The overall narrative is coherent and reasonably close to the Bible, dispensing with the birth and childhood of Moses (which took most of the first half of DeMille's 1956 film!) before the opening credits have finished rolling. Marco Frisina's score and Raffaele Mertes' photography are beautiful. Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Kingsley: He's clearly going for broke in an effort to sell his emotions in every scene, and the effort is mostly successful. Rather than declaiming biblical words in high-handed style, Kingsley uses the speech rhythms of powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela (as he relates in interviews) to create an intimate portrait of Israel's first prophet and lawgiver. Despite its fidelity to the source material and its other merits, this photoplay rises or falls on Sir Ben Kingsley's shoulders, and he manages to elevate the film from a dry religious lesson into a performance of deep insight into the thoughts and emotions of the man ""who talked to God face to face."" His performance in the burning bush and theophany (Ten Commandments) scenes are particularly memorable, emphasizing the film's gift at presenting the supernatural in a naturalistic way. And the confrontations between Kingsley and Langella as the Pharaoh are electric. If you see this movie, you will feel like you know Moses better than in any other film portrayal, and that is perhaps its greatest achievement.",1381449600,2,4851,5.264857881136951

So when Moses came out, I wasn't sure I'd like it. I had seen Joseph and was very impressed--Ben Kingsly plays in both. Again, it's no Hollywood exaggerated set, but production value is perfect for that time period.

Moses depicted the story perfectly. A few things were off from the story, but the production stayed true to its time period and the story stayed as true as one can hope for a movie.

Superb performance as always by Ben Kingsley as a sterling combination of a shy and stuttering to passionate and charismatic leader. A likeable and strong Aaron played by David Suchet, and Christopher Lee as an arrogant and imperious Ramses.
And of course Maurice Roves as the rabble rousing malcontent Zerack.
Geraldine McEwan as an excitable Miriam and , Anita Zagaria as an attractive and wise Zipporah and Enrico Lo Verso as a passionate and loyal young Joshua.

800273,3,6304140908,"I enjoyed the movie. It was more realistic than The 10 Commandments which was done for theatraical purposes. However, in some places it did not follow scripture very well. First it showed Moses as a child when he was not heard of from the time he was put on the Nile until he was about 30. Secondly it showed him leaving his wife and children behind when he returned to Egypt. The Bible clearly states he took his wife and 2 sons. Moses sent them back to Jethro, her father when on the trip to Egypt. When Jethro came to visit Moses the dialog about his missing Zapphora was not accurate. Jethro brought her and her 2 sons back to Moses and returned to his land without them. There was a lost also to learn about Moses and the Exodus that is only theatrically portrayed or not portrayed in the Ten Commandments. One account was when the people wanted to hear God too. The movie showed God speaking the 10 commandments through the people before God gave them to Moses on Mt. Sinai. It showed how the people were afraid to listen to God and learned to trust more in the leading of their God through Moses. There is a lot to learn from the movie if you read the account of Moses. There is also other things that had to be changed to fit the script . It was worth watching and I highly recommend it if you are wanting a Biblical account of Moses. I recommend that you follow Moses in Exodus. It will bring a blessing to your heart. To follow the life of a man who knew not God but was willing to follow Him when He spoke to Moses.

I throroughly enjoy The Prince of Egypt but its drawback is that is departs from the biblical narrative in several major ways, and live action films are more credible for classroom use than cartoons. The Ten Commandments looks great but has too much melodrama and a distracting and unnecessary love triangle. This film looks just as good as The Ten Commandments, but the writing and direction are not nearly as good as the sets and costumes and effects. It fails to deliver the natural drama of the story by a very pedestrian approach in many instances, and in others is too melodramatic and overwrought, with too many people yelling and wailing, including Moses. I like that he laughs but too often he seems just loony, laughing oddly one moment and then roaring the next. The people of Israel never number more than maybe 100 persons in any scene.

I showed this movie to all of my classes after we finished our study on the Hebrews.  They loved it!! This movie is outstanding, in my opinion.  It shows the humanity of Moses, who the Bible mentions was ""slow"" in speech, and who at first asked ""why me?"" when God chose him to go back to Egypt.  The Pharaoh and the Egyptian culture are displayed in a very authentic way, and the plagues were done in a very effective way.  The scene where the Red Sea parts is way better than that of the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston in my opinion. This movie also shows the journey through Sinai, the Ark of the Covenant, and many other Biblical details.  The only drawback is that they do not make the Hebrews look like an entire nation of people, showing only about 100 or so rather than the many  thousands that there were in reality.

800467,5,6304140908,"If I could rate it a 10 I would. It was great; however, be prepared to dedicate time to watch the entirety of the movie. My suggestion is to let it be one of those movies for a rainy day or for a weekend you stay in. The movie sticks very closely to the bible, however does not replace it (in no form)and the writer's do use some creative adjustments. I was impressed on how much they got into the 3 hours. They showed many of the plaques that fell on Egypt (many that other adaptations don't touch on), many of the trials the Hebrews had to endure in the wilderness, (the manna and quail, the golden calf, Miriam's leperosy, the striking of the rock), and a pretty good depiction of what Moses' personality may have been like. The parts not so pleased with- how Aaron was let off so easy as it related to the golden calf (it is depicted as he only allowed the others to make the calf and it doesn't show he is the one to make the calf), the small amount of people depicted in the exodus and in the wilderness (their where really over 600,000 and a couple of hundred).But it only made me go back and read the story of the Exodus again (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,and Deuteronomy), so it was a win-win situation. Eventhough it is very long; once you start the movie, it grabs your attention until the very end. I got Moses in the collection (which I strongly encourage for anyone buying this movie). Though they use some creative adjustments, it really gets the point across and well worth the price. Again 10 stars and 4 thumbs up.",1202774400,2,1531,4.337979094076655

800469,5,6304140908,"This is not as exciting as Charlton Heston's TEN COMMANDMENTS but it is every bit as good in terms of instruction and as a depiction of a biblical story. It covers some aspects of the exodus story that are not found in the older classic and which help make more sense out of the story. The sets are not as big or as expensive but everything is well done.

The story is the seminal event for the story of the Jewish people and nation. The people are held as slaves in Egypt. Moses is raised as a privileged prince of the royal house but is conflicted. He kills an Egyptian while saving a Jewish slave and flees for his life. He finds safety but God orders him to go back and free the people. This he does with his brother and brings the people out of bondage and into the wilderness where they are forged into a real nation.

These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!

Also, Moses was a general of Pharaoh's army... not a blundering clutz with a speech impediment (stuttering) as they present him here.  This movie exalts Aaron as the one constantly making Moses go on.  We know Moses was reluctant at times, but on the mount, Moses begged God to kill him along with the rest of the nation rather than go on without them and Aaron is not there telling him to do it.  Considering these limitations, they did the best they could from there and had most of the other details somewhat in line with scripture but I've seen better.  This company has some other stories that are excellent but I find this one the fartherst from being an accurate protrayal.",1143417600,10,889,4.709677419354839
800474,5,6304140908,"Moses is among the best film that I have seen from the Bible collection. Among the others I have seen are Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob and Samson and Delilah. Ben Kingsley plays Moses, a feat he performs with remarkable success. He plays the ordinary man who answers God's call to carry out enormous responsibilities. Watching this film is a spiritual journey illustrating God's love for his people. Best of all, the story in the film is very close to that in the Bible (unlike the more spectacular ""Ten Commandments"" by Cecil DeMille).

This is a compelling movie that illustrates vividly the challenges that Moses and a nation of people who followed him to the Promised Land had to endure. Moses, who stutters and occasionally blunders, initially feels inadequate and unequal to the enormity of his task and needed assistance from his brother Aaron. However, as the film develops, Moses grows not only in faith but also to be a confident leader who speaks with absolute authority as the Voice of God.

The production is excellent. The stage settings, costumes and portrayal of the realities of day-to-day living in those times are very impressive. The Biblical story of Exodus comes to life as one gets some appreciation of the challenges that Moses had  leading the mass of people under constant threat of attack, hunger and without a home and who had doubts about the authenticity of the relationship between Moses and God.

There are many unforgettable moments in the movie such as the parting of the Red Sea and when Moses reaches the gates of the Promised Land, but cannot get there. However, the righteous and God fearing Moses accepts God's will.

My only minor criticism is that although it is estimated that up to two and half-million Israelites left Egypt during the time of the Exodus, one sees the largest group of people in the film numbering just over 70, due to budget constraints. However, this does little to dilute this great movie which is well worth watching.",1143072000,4,1982,4.85207100591716
800475,5,6304140908,"I am always buying and purchasing Books or Movies regarding the Bible. This version is the best. It is not as hollywood driven yet by far surpasses in content, acting and quality. There are so many aspects that are brought out in this version you will experience more of the real emotions of the man himself, Moses. Unlike the hollywood version, when Ben Kingsley as Moses stands before the sea...it doesn't happen instantly. You can see him standing and agnoizing through faith as time passes before the event. When his sister dies and the people are again grumbling to him I can understand his anger and how the events that followed occured. The true drama of a lot of things is what makes this movie superior. He was a man called to do a mighty work and Kingsley is outstanding and captures it! Crystal Clear",1138838400,5,811,4.6

The casting is excellent; especially Ben Kingsley.  He does a fantastic job.

Being a corporate executive I especially appreciate how Moses struggled in how to lead people in the midst of his own inadequacies and personal burdens.  It has inspired me in so many ways.

For people more interested in its spiritual content, you won't be dissapointed either.  It shows a real man [not like Charlton Heston in the Ten Commandments], in all his humaness, trying to know and obey his God.  The spriritual element is of benefit to Jew or Christian; doesn't matter.

I hope it inspires you as much as it did me.",1138233600,4,875,4.660130718954249

Ben Kingsley's depiction of Moses made the movie enjoyable and was a good cast for the part. True to the written story with very little deviation from the Biblical account, it is the best depiction of the story of Moses ever filmed (and I have seen several poorly done and grossly re-written). From Israel's bondage in Egypt to their wandering the wilderness for 40 years to the Promised Land, the land God promised to Abraham, this movie promises to deliver.

This struck me as odd since I was used to the Moses from ""The Ten Commandments,"" in which Charleston Heston plays a good-looking character who is liked and revered by everyone. However, I noticed that this movie is much more accurate according to the scripture. And for this reason, I really enjoyed this movie's version and portrayal. After watching this movie, you will have a greater knowledge of one of the most amazing stories of the Old Testament.",1126915200,5,572,4.846938775510204
800599,5,6304140908,"I really enjoyed this movie. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job with this role. I think this type of movie shows the real side of being human while at the same time loving God. In this portrayal, you see all the ""warts"" of being human. Being angry. Being disappointed. Failing. Yet at the same time, Kingsley shows such an ""awe"" and love for God. One of my favorite scenes is where God is speaking to all the people. Moses is standing smiling (even laughing) at the joy of hearing his God speak while the people are terrified. It really shows what it's like to have a real relationship with God. I would recommend this movie to anyone. As has been stated, ""The Ten Commandments"" is a classic too and sure has the effects galore. As also pointed out, there are some variations from scripture. But I think the thing that always makes me feel so good is seeing the human side of these people we've read about and heard about all our lives. To be able to see they faced the same problems we face, to see that they dealt with all the heartaches and disappointments we do, to see that they just sometimes ""blow it"" like we do, well.......to my way of thinking, it only brings me closer than ever to God in realizing his love for us all.

It's truly a wonderful movie. I would highly recommend it.",1126742400,5,1290,4.375
800600,5,6304140908,"I have to agree with what so many people have said already...this one's a keeper!

I tend to go for accuracy rather than drama, nothing frustrates me worse than having to stand up and say ""That didn't happen like that!""

With regards to the comparision between this Moses movie and The Ten Commandments, this one stands out more in my mind.

Major instances:

1. He talked with a stutter in real life; he talked with a stutter in this version. Very well done.

2. The burning bush really was on fire, not just glowing as in 10 Commandments. Very effective.

I do have a few major complaints with this version, and in most, 10 Commandments does a much better job.

1. There could have been tons more people than there were. According to the Bible, there were several million strong, in this, there's maybe 150 at the most.

2. The parting of the Red Sea was much more dramatic in 10 Commandments. This one never really showed it happening, just what it looked like afterwards.

3. The Bible said a pillar of fire held back the Egyptians, not bolts of lightning.

4. The Bible also says that they crossed on dry ground. If it was raining, the ground wouldn't have been dry.

5. Jethro had 7 daughters, not three.

In short, there are many things that vary between the two, if you want more accurate as far as major details, go for this one. If you want more minor details wrong, but plenty of things to go ""Oh, cool"" at, then skip this one and watch 10 Commandments.",1124323200,9,1464,4.4216417910447765

It covers more of the story than ""The Ten Commandments"" with less Hollywood twisting of the story.  My criticism of the film rests primarily on budget constraints.  Scholars estimate there were two to two and a half million Jews who left Egypt in the Exodus.  The largest group of people in this film is about 75 people.  Perhaps computer graphics can go back and add more people in now.  Additionally Jethro was supposed to have 7 daughters.  In this film he only has three.  In spite of the budget limitations, this film is the best out there.",1116288000,4,638,4.48695652173913

Good acting and special effects, and far more biblically accurate than any other movie I've seen on the Exodus. This movie has all the passion without all the ""cheese"" typically seen with many bible movies.  If you enjoyed Jeremiah and Esther of the Bible Series, you will love this movie.",1111363200,10,485,4.574712643678161
800604,4,6304140908,"Watching movies like this is a good way to review the bible stories and also get a slightly different understanding of what happened.

An example of this is when Moses strikes the rock twice to get water without checking with God first.  That event is presented as being a result of the frustration that undoubtedly occurred during their 40 years of wanderings in the desert.

The movie also gives the feeling that there were some key events where some people had to be weeded out of the group because they were going to cause problems.  This happened when Moses came back with the 10 commandments the first time and with the rebellion of the Koras.  In both case bloodshed occurred.

Moses was no choir boy anyway since he left Egypt after killing that one Egyptian.  I suscribe to the Edgar Cayce information about the motivation for this killing.  That Egyptian had sexually assaulted Moses' sister.

I would have liked to see the part when Moses first saw the beautiful 'Ethiopian' woman come along.  If I recall correctly from the bible his attraction to this woman created some controversy.

There's still a lot of mysteries surrounding these events and this story could be done again with tremendous special effects.

The hard part is knowing more precisely what exactly happened.

800605,5,6304140908,"Though this television production doesn't have the epic grandeur of ""The Ten Commandments"", it is a marvelous telling of the story of Moses, with some superb acting; there are a few liberties taken to flesh out the script, but the heart of the Biblical account is intact, with a memorable portrayal by Ben Kingsley as the prophet who was ""clumsy with words"" but led his people to freedom.
Other terrific performances come from David Suchet as Aaron, Sonia Braga as Zipporah, and Philip Stone as Jethro, and as the ""bad guys"", Frank Langella, who with his sonorous voice makes an effective Pharaoh, and Maurice Roeves as Zerack, the man who is a continual kvetch.
Filmed in sub-saharan Quarzazate and Agadir, Morocco, it is visually beautiful, with the excellent cinematography by Raffaele Mertes; I like the neutral palette, and the artifacts and costuming that give it an authentic look of ancient times. Added to the atmosphere is the wonderful score by Marco Frisina.
The effects are good, from the parting of the sea to the tablets of the law, and other than a short sequence of violence (which includes a swift depiction of sacrificing an animal) after the golden calf incident, it is family friendly. Total running time is 184 minutes.
This is a film that stands up to a lot of repeated viewing; it is so full of eternal truths, and content that is applicable to our lives today.",1081987200,91,1385,4.799163179916318
800606,5,6304140908,"I thought this was the best of films I've seen about Moses. I liked the way he was portrayed as an ordinary man who was chosen and called by God. He had to grow into greatness and he had to grow in his faith. I found his transition from ordinariness to greatness over the years and through many difficult circumstances and difficult choices to be inspirational.
Films I've seen in the past about Biblical characters have often tended to come across as a bit formal or contrived feeling. I thought the portrayal of how the people lived had a more natural look and feel to it, instead of looking more like actors simply trying to portray past ways of living.
The film gave me a better sense of what Moses and the people of Israel went through in their journey from slaves to free people reaching the Promised Land. There were many difficult choices to make and some chose unwisely. I was touched by the portrayal of Moses' grieving when the people rebelled and God dealt with them.
It brought tears to my eyes at the end when Moses, before he died, was standing on the top of the mountain looking down at the Promised Land. I thought it was an excellent portrayal of Moses and his fulfillment of God's destiny for him.",1069977600,6,1216,4.457399103139013
