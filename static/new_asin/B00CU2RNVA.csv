5912126,4,B00CU2RNVA,"I thought this movie was going to be pretty lame when it first started. But apart from a few oddities here and there, it actually turned out to be quite a fun and entertaining movie. My kids enjoyed it too.",1385942400,,206,4.175
5912127,4,B00CU2RNVA,"I would have given it a 5 because the storyline is well done and keeps the kids interested, however there is some cussing in it.",1384300800,11,128,4.16
5912128,5,B00CU2RNVA,Tad the lost Explorer is a great 3D flick. The 3D effects aren't bad at all. The price is even better!

5912131,3,B00CU2RNVA,"Anation wasn't as good as expected.  Story line was ok.  Kids didn't find it as funny as I thought they would.  Looks like a one off, there was no hanger for another movie.",1382227200,,172,4.151515151515151
5912132,5,B00CU2RNVA,"Tad the Lost Explorer is a pretty fun 88 minute animated film whose main character is a tribute to the Junior character from Indiana Jones. It's a kids' movie but has plenty of references to movies adults will have seen in their youth and jokes that will probably go over the heads of kids (because their supposed to) but adults will smile at.  Like most kids movies the human heroes have their animal sidekicks.  Tad has his dog and the main female character Sara (who when she takes off her formal shirt and appears in the top she is wearing on the cover, changes Tad's mind to go on this risk his life adventure) has a mute parrot who communicates with Wile-E Coyote type wooden signs.  Even if kids (or yourself) haven't seen the Indiana Jones films, they'll still understand this but it's fun watching this and thinking, oh yeah that's playing homage to that scene from that movie.  Tad the Explorer does have a plot of its own too.

Since the product page at the time of this review doesn't list one I'll outline the basic plot but there are some spoilers from the start of the film here. Tad was a bit of a loner as a kid, raised by his grandma and always wanted to be an archaeologist which obviously earned him a lot of ridicule from neighbourhood kids.  But Tad is a good natured guy and just rolled with it along with his fear of mummies, and has continued to do so in his current construction industry jobs as a very clutsy adult.  I say jobs as he can't seem to keep them, always getting distracted by what treasures the construction team unearths at the sites which he takes to the museum where a good natured professor has taken pity on him and humours each find, even though a shelf shows them to be anything but artefacts.  The professor has also just discovered a letter that has gotten delayed along the way with a ticket telling him to bring his half of a mysterious tablet to South America that departs in hours.  Tad does his friend a favour and drives him to the airport but inadvertently injures the man in the departure lounge and doesn't correct the flight attendant who assumes he is the professor since he is holding the boarding pass who rushes him onto the flight.  When he arrives he finds out pretending to be the professor is a very risky thing to do be doing when snatched by typical movie type villains, including a guy with a claw hand giving a nice homage to Mad from Inspector Gadget who wants the tablet.  Luckily Tad escapes and wants no further part of this but changes his mind and teams up with the letter sender's daughter due to lust, after a change of her outfit, to find her father and bring the tablet to him. Of course the villains aren't going to give up either.

The animation is pretty good, your modern 3D style, originally this wasn't an English language film but obviously since it's a cartoon you don't need to worry about lip movements not matching voices and so on.  The movie does follow your typical kids' movie clichs and therefore has a bit of predictability to it, which is further enhanced by some scenes being a homage to the Indiana Jones franchise, but it is certainly one of the more fun animated movies to be released in the last couple of years and definitely one that adults will have no problem sitting through or even watching without kids.",1373155200,13,3313,4.4561983471074385

5912164,4,B00CU2RNVA,"If you have any experience in the realm of animated feature films, you're already aware of a simple reality:  The good ones are generally really good.  Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney, Sony; they've all spoiled us with massive budgeted, butter-smooth animated, touching storied works of art.  The bad ones, on the other hand, are typically very bad.  How can one tell the good ones apart from the bad at a glance?  The bad ones are direct-to-dvd affairs and you've likely never heard about them before happening upon them in the Redbox, on Netflix etc.

So what makes the bad ones so bad you ask?  Simply this: 99.9% of the time they are actually foreign films, created for a foreign market that the rights are bought up for and shipped over here to the US of A as a direct-to-dvd deal.  They are then slapped with an English dub voice track, given a name similar to something you have heard of (Know of Frozen? Meet Frozen Land.  Familiar with Kung Fu Panda? How about Chop Kick Panda?  Like Happy Feet?  Perhaps your kid will be confused into picking up Tappy Toes.)  There are literally dozens of these on the market and more released on a weekly basis.

So what's the problem with that?  Well simply this- timing.  Since the viewer expects the mouth to actually move with the dialog, this puts the English dub crew into a terrible predicament.  More often than not, dialog becomes ridiculously simplistic, redundant, and you can forget comedic timing; or for that matter even natural conversational flow.  Scenes feel disconnected, the pacing of the film feels somehow off, younger viewers get bored.  Older viewers start to contemplate the meaning of existence.  In short, it's ugly.

All of this brings us to Tad the Lost Explorer from Studiocanal and brought to the US as, you guessed it, a direct-to-DVD affair from Vivendi.  Yes it's a foreign film imported (originally Spain's 2012 Las aventuras de Tadeo Jones).  Except here's where things become a shocker: It's actually good!  Good for an import?  Nope, just good period.

The story, in my spoiler-free summary, follows the adventures of one Thaddeus ""Tad"" Stones; a Chicago bricklayer with aspirations of becoming a world-renowned archaeologist.  One fateful day, however, a series of events result in his being mistaken for a real professor of archaeology and our hapless hero (and his dog Jeff; short for Thomas Jefferson) find themselves on a flight to Peru in search of the Lost City of Paititi.

There he expects to meet with the genius Professor Lavrof and his beautiful daughter Sara to unite two sections of ancient tablet believed to be the key to the fabled city.  Factor in a robotic-handed German accented villain names Kopponen and the shady Odysseus corporation who seek the riches of the ancient city for themselves and it's high adventure in the steamy south the moment Tad steps off the plane.

If the setup sounds like something out of an Indiana Jones film, rest assured, that's exactly what it intends to be (do keep in mind the original character's last name was even Jones, changed to Stones here presumably to avoid legal trouble).  And while the concept has enough merit to be cute, the film actually manages to play out like a genuine big-budget Indy adventure rather than a silly spoof.  They even cleverly integrate an Indy reference when Tad receives his trademarked hat and careful viewers may even catch a hint of the Indiana Jones theme song (used with permission) during one of the action sequences.

The visuals are gorgeous, the animation spot-on and even the pacing, usually the biggest faux pas of foreign films turned domestic, is flawless.  I came into this one expecting a lot of silly slap stick visual gag comedy and pun-filled dialog but was pleasantly surprised to find neither being the case.  The humor is, at times, quite layered to appeal to audiences of all ages.  Some of the subtle stuff is the best stuff.

Now the bad news, yes there is a little of that too I'm afraid.  The film makes use of a couple appropriate words/ phrases on occasion.  Words like ""crap"" and ""hell"" work their way into the dialog so if these are things you wish to prevent younger viewers from exposure to, be advised.  Additionally it seems the rather buxom proportions of the female lead Sara have managed to offend more than a fair share of female viewers in particular though in all fairness, it's no different from anything you'd see on primetime television these days, on the cover of the tabloids or the latest issue of Cosmo.  She's always fully clothed and drawn in at tasteful angles.

All in all, this is perhaps the first film I've encountered in my travels that actually manages to succeed in an area where I previously didn't think possible:  It's that rare foreign animated film that comes off so spectacularly in action that it's easy to mistake it for an inflated budget domestic piece.  While the intricacies of the plot and the dialog will keep more mature viewers interested, the pair of pets (said dog Jeff and a parrot that uses signs to communicate like Wile E Coyote) should keep kids involved.  Factor in a cleverly done mummy at the end and all of the ingredients are preset for success.

With the price of the DVD release of late in bargain-bin territory and a hardy 80-minutes of genuinely entertaining CG animated action, it's very easy to recommend this one.",1412294400,3,5371,4.790217391304348

5912192,5,B00CU2RNVA,"In various reviews and within the movie itself there are references to homage paid to Indiana Jones. Having no interest in seeing an ""Indiana Jones"" movie, I am unable to understand the reference.
With that said, this is a delightful movie.
As an unwed father of seven kids with two more on the way, I try to keep a fresh stock of enjoyable movies for the kids to watch and leave me alone when they come over.
There is a mute bird in the movie with an endless supply  of comedic commentary signs that he (assuming it's a ""he"") pulls out of somewhere to express himself during any given moment.  A similar act seen in ""Monster in Paris"" and ""Pirates! Band of Misfits"" to name a couple.
At one point, I did have to stop the movie to explain a certain scene to the kids. The female protagonist, Sara kissed the dog Jeff on the back of his head while Tad is holding him. For an instant, Tad looks down at Jeff's crotch and then up at Sara as she is walking away realizing Jeff's ""affection"" for Sara as well.
Other unspoken instances of props and body language will be directing the viewers attention to Sara's generous assets throughout the movie.
A refreshing movie to see in what is often an over-hyped market for movies put out by the other major studios. Often times, actually seeing the movie feels more redundant than novel after the hype surrounding the movie leaves little new material to enjoy.",1390348800,4,1400,4.486274509803922

Is indeed a Christian movie, though it didn't seem advertised as such, or maybe I didn't look at the description^^D ha...
There was only one curse word: the bad guy said it, the worse version ""heck"". And no blasphemiesOO)! Not a lot of toilet humor, though they did ""beat up"" some animals many times (a bird hits a window)... doesn't show an obsession over dogs as tv used to, thank goodness...the dog is constantly being shown in a negative view, though is loved by his owner Tad:/...
A very realistic movie in the sense that everyone has their weaknesses: Tad lies...etc. But many times Faith is brought up in a positive light and not ""back-hand slapped"" as corruption would have in tv...A very good movie in that respect:)
There is goofyness, and they use a bit of violence, though it goes with the plot and not just for ""comedy""...

Overall a real treat:) A huge lesson (YES! A lesson!) at the end of the movie that SPOILER money isn't important. Love and family is...
A good movie:)!",1525910400,,1168,4.561904761904762

8605250,2,B00CU2RNVA,"Watched with 11 year-old nephew. For the most part, he seemed to like it. I thought the plot was decent for a kid's movie. However, it was absolutely maddening the way the lead female character was presented. Why, before traveling to find her kidnapped father, would she change into shorts and a revealing top? The lead male character looks at her and gets all googly-eyed. All the men were dressed appropriately. Long pants and long sleeve shirts. Sara (the only woman) wore rolled up shorts and a tank top that shows way too much boob for a kid's movie. I mean her huge breasts heaved and swayed and were pushed up when she crossed her arms. Completely ridiculous. Mind you, a significant portion of the movie takes place in a jungle. It's like Sara is too stupid to know how to dress appropriately.

There's also a scene where one of the characters shows a picture of a woman dressed in a Playboy Bunny costume. It's just stupid.

I would NOT recommend this movie. Girls will be influenced to believe they must put their bodies on display instead of their brains. Boys will be influenced to objectify women.",1502323200,2,1110,4.629441624365482
