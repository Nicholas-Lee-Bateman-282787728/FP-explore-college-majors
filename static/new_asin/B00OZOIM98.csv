8685831,5,B00OZOIM98,"Quite possibly the worst documentary ever I have ever seen and I totally recommend it. Five stars because my daughter and I got such a great laugh out of it, and the next day we are still laughing. And we probably will be for quite some time. My daughter is taking it to her friends house so she can laugh also. To me, that is worth the $15. And I am not really kidding, the entertainment value of this film is off the charts. Starting with the whole ""bootleg feel"" of the documentary, and the music that is NOT MCR, to the footage of a band that is also NOT MCR, and the 1970's special effects graphics. Very retro of them. Retro is in. We also had lots of fun counting the pixels on the really bad photographs of Gerard. It reminded me of playing video games in 1980. There are only a  few photos, but they show you the same ones over and over so if you are not done counting by the time it's off the screen, wait for them to show it to you again and continue. The Danger Days cover will imply that this film covers more than the first two albums, which it does not. And the ""rare footage"" that is mentioned? I think they were referring to the MANY moving shots taken while driving by random cemeteries. It makes the film so much cooler. If you miss one, just wait about 30 seconds and there will be another one. They were not, however, referring to footage of MCR. Because there is none.  Oh, and the interviews....yes, LOTS of interviews! And ONE of the people interviewed was quite relevant to the story!  But I did love the guy sitting in the window. He said something about the MCR audience looking like cats hair standing up, which again made us crack up. Oh, and they didn't even mention the education part of it! That is a bonus. We got to learn everything we never wanted to know about New Jersey. Now, what really made me take this film seriously was the British lady that likely had never even heard of MCR before this gig, that they hired to narrate much of the film. She has a very serious voice and a classy British accent, which automatically adds value to the film. Because England. So to sum it all up, I am actually really glad I bought this for my daughter. TOTALLY worth it, it will continue to give us comedy material for weeks to come.",1484956800,,2259,4.261072261072261
