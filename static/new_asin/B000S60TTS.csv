8325694,5,B000S60TTS,"One of Coach Billy Robinson's (RIP) better instructional dvd sets out there.  You will not only learn a ton of old time catch wrestling material here but you will also get a nice history lesson too as Coach Robinson breaks down the history of CACC.  If you are looking to learn some things that you may not see anymore but are still effective and can still work, this set is for you.",1458604800,,383,4.305555555555555
8325695,5,B000S60TTS,"Well like the other reviews mentioned. The sound is kinda weird. Billy Robinson has the ""leather lungs"" his voice sounds like he's smoked a carton every week. It's 4 discs the first 2 last about 2 hours. The 3rd about an hour, the 4th about 45 mins. Here and there Billy does like an interview. It's interesting, takes up about an hour. He's got mma legend Erik Paulson (Team Lesnar, Ultimate Fighter). Josh Barnett, former UFC Heavyweight Champion. For some reason David Hart Smith is on here with his face blurred out. I'm pretty sure it's him his size, and haircut. Probably under contract with wwe at the time. It's pretty easy to follow along. I'm glad it wasn't just rehashed BJJ. These moves are dangerous as Hell. Billy Robinson taught Kazushi Sakuraba, one of his many students. Almost all the moves are practical and broken down. There's also a few workouts in here. The 4th disc is edited weird and hard to follow.",1436659200,,925,4.646341463414634
8325696,5,B000S60TTS,"Tremendous knowledge from Billy. A little tough to hear at times, but it's well worth it for the knowledge.  This stuff is deadly!",1375401600,,130,4.6521739130434785
8325697,4,B000S60TTS,"The DVDs are good material but the thing is the SOUND is not the best. Billy's voice is not the crystal clear type, and there is some background noise (very unprofessional) in some of the material, where high school boys apparently come in and practice wrestling while filming is in progress. You have to be really patient and really into catch wrestling if you plan to watch all of it and not want to press STOP before the second half of the first DVD.",1236643200,4,453,4.404761904761905
