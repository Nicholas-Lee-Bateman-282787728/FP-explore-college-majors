It has that vibe that I think suits Serge so much, and the acting is knockout by all, especially Eric Elmosnino as Serge. Visually impressive and with a soundtrack that could not get any better.  If you are in the slightest interested in Serge and his life and loves, you will enjoy this movie. RIP Lucy Gordon XX.",1332979200,,384,4.394366197183099

4436157,5,B004NJR516,"I knew very little about Serge Gainsbourg but now I'd like to know more.  I don't know if I'd agree that his life was ""heroic"" but Joann Sfar has made a masterful tribute to the artist-musician.  Sfar's art work is, in itself, wonderful.  I knew when I watched the opening titles that this was going to be a visual delight.  There is plenty of eye candy of all sorts, including some luscious erotic scenes.  The music was mostly all new to me but I loved it all.

Eric Elmosnino plays the adult Gainsbourg and while I've never seen the real guy, this one is quite amazing..kind of a blend of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Leonard Cohen.  He captures the decadence, elegance, originality and self-destructive impulses of Gainsbourg and yet there's no menace in him, there's even a qualtiy of innocence and sweetness to him.  I have to wonder how accurate that is....maybe the film maker added his own interpretation to the character?  I don't know.  I do know that this is a brilliant, visually splendid, fascinating film.",1358121600,,1014,4.7102272727272725
4436158,5,B004NJR516,"I don't usually care for film biographies, especially about rock stars or pop culture. It is usually someone being portrayed as a narcissist/self-centered/junkie/drunk ""artist"".

In a shallow view, ""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"" can be one more of these movies. Certainly the ""A Heroic Life"" helps. What is so ""heroic"" about his life? That he nailed BB, Jane Birkin among others? Maybe. That's something beyond reach of any mere mortal. He was a great poet and musician and produced amazing works of art. I am not sure if that is enough to qualify someone as ""heroic"".

The big difference between this movie and others from the genre is the approach of that inner Dionysian voice that is inside us all. Some of us totally ignore this voice, some dispute her balancing with other voices that are also inside us that control our reason and some of us obey that voice blindly. This movie is mostly about the relationship between Serge and that voice. There is one scene that Serge told the voice to go away and that he didn't need her anymore. He didn't need her because he just didn't need her or because he became the voice?

I found this an amazing movie. Well made, amazing acting and so on. And, yes. It was indeed a treat to be in the same room when Serge played his songs to Brigitte Bardot for the first time.",1358121600,,1311,4.5702127659574465

4436161,4,B004NJR516,"Serge Gainsbourg was born Lucien Ginsburg (Kacey Mottet Klein) and grew up in Nazi occupied Paris.  Lucien was smallish boy interested in art, especially graphic stories.  He and his parents escape Jewish extradition but return after the war.  Lucien, following his father's footsteps becomes a piano player in various nightclubs.  His manager suggests the name change to Serge (more masculine) and a less identifying spelling of his surname.

Now brilliantly played by Eric Elmosnino, Serge has a compelling charm that manages to seduce the most unlikely women.  With some historical accuracy, Gainsbourg has numerous affairs including one with rising starlet Brigitte Bardot (a spot on Laetitia Casta).  He suffers through a couple marriages before eventually marrying British model and actress Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon).  That union produced French singer and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.

The film features a couple characters created in Serge's mind including an alter ego known as La Gueule (Doug Jones), a giant, exaggerated version of himself with huge ears and proboscis.  Gainsbourg is clearly an interesting character and a train-wreck in the making.  He gets caught up in his fame and fondness for the ladies, all fueled by excessive alcohol.  The film features non-stop smoking by just about everybody in the movie including a gaggle of pre-teen boys and girls.  Be forewarned if this is a problem.  Director Joann Sfar adapted the screenplay from his graphic novel and he is clearly a big fan.  The film is sometimes erotic, sometimes irreverent but always interesting.  Like other filmmakers, Sfar has a hard time stopping as the movie clocks in at 2 hrs. 16 minutes.  Recommended.",1338940800,3,1697,5.295880149812734

4436163,5,B004NJR516,"Comics Artist Joann Sfar has made a successful foray into Film Directing, with Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life (2010) This film biography of French Musician and Artist Serge Gainsbourg draws on Sfar's abilities as a comic book artist through its extensive use of fantasy artwork, animation and puppetry. Sfar wrote the screenplay based on his graphic novel. Sfar is a self-confessed Gainsbourg fanatic, and it is easy to see why: they both share an affinity for drawing and painting, and both are French, but with Jewish heritage.

Gainsbourg grew up during the Nazi occupation of Paris, and that is where this film bio begins. Lucien Ginsburg is a most precocious young student at Art School, who also has a talent for music. His father makes his living as a bar room pianist. Lucien, played by Kacey Mottet Klein, has a very active imagination, and his imaginary friend takes on a life of his own, depicted as an egg like head that grows and grows until it explodes, leaving a tall ladies man who doesn't let his long nose or strange looks get in the way of his conquests. Sfar uses his own artistic talent to depict Gainsbourg's alter ego as a Sesame Street Muppet-like puppet--he looks a lot like Count von Count, the vampire who was obsessed with counting. This seems like an odd mix for a film about a decadent French Rock Star that is not for children, but it works because it really gives an insight into the interior world of Serge. It is his alter ego who gives the shy young man confidence and career advice, such as to go all out in playing guitar like the two fingered gypsy Django Reinhardt, and to ditch his art in favor of pop music.

Eric Elmosnino plays Gainsbourg as a young man onwards, and he was a real find for director Sfar. Sfar had wanted to use Gainsbourg's daughter in the film, a la Dylan biopic I'm Not There's fluid concept of gender and identity, but she pulled out while still giving her family's blessing on the project. Elmosnino does a great job, depicting Gainsbourg convincingly from his early twenties to his death in his sixties. It is quite a heroic life spanning very tumultuous times. The chain smoking, hard drinking, Artist/Composer/Rock Star wades through various lovers, singers, and Artists, in a life that is nothing if not heroic. Laetitia Casta is cast as Brigitte Bardot, Anna Mouglalis portrays chanteuse Juliette Gr&eacute;co, and Sara Forestier plays French Pop Tart France Gall, along with many other superb performances from the supporting cast.

The Bottom Line is that Director Joann Sfar has created an illuminating portrait of Serge Gainsbourg, and Eric Elmosnino has turned in a brilliant performance, displaying all of Gainsbourg's quirky genius for the world to see. Je'taime.

4436164,5,B004NJR516,"""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"" (2010 release; France; 130 min.) was in US movie theatres last Summer. It brings a non-traditional retelling of the ""heroic"" life of Serge Gainsbourg, France's original but talented ""bad boy"" singer/songwriter/performer. Why non-traditional? For one because the movie jumps back-and-forth between various phases of Gainsbourg's life. For another because the director brings an imaginary animated character into the movie (""good"" vs. ""bad"" Gainsbourg), Don't let that stop you from watching this movie. I just went with the flow, and really enjoyed this a lot. It was pure eye and ear candy to see how songs like ""La Javanaise"", ""Requiem Pour Un C.."", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (duet with Brigitte Bardot) and of course ""Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus"" (duet with Jane Birkin) came about.

The acting is nothing short of amazing thoughout the movie. ric Elmosnino as Serge Gainsbourg looks like a reincarnated Gainsbourg, and in fact he did all the singing in this movie himself (he rightfully won an French Oscar-equivalent for Best Actor for this role). But also worth mentioning are Lucy Gordon as Jane Birkin, and Ltitia Casta as Brigitte Bardot (sadly, Lucy Gordon committed suicide shortly after fliming of this movie wrapped).

I am a life-long fan of Serge Gainsbourg, having grown up in Belgium. Having see this movie last summer, it ignited a Gainsbourg ""re-appreciation"" period for me, as I relistened to several of his albums, and I even got to see Jane Birkin live in concert for the first time ever in December of last year. All that aside, if you are a fan of Gainsbourg, you cannot go wrong with this movie. But even if you're not super into Gainsbourg, I will venture that you can enjoy this movie for what it is: a celebration of a unique talent in France's performing history. ""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1333152000,4,1858,4.990322580645161

8436729,5,B004NJR516,"I would like to begin by saying I was so lucky to have the moment to see this wonderful cheerful movie. I had a two hours of delightful time watching and listening to the Serge Gainsbourg's songs along with many other women singer joined.
 Also his other talent which is drawing comic book cartoons which appeared also in this movie as another charactor following Gainsbourg and keep making him annoyed which was really fun to watch.
 Sometimes the cartoon images are appeared as part of the shots which was also a great delight to look.

But above all the acting of the Eric Elmosnio as the Serge Gainsbourg himself was the biggest joy for me. It's not that he is beautiful or handsome or anything but somethinng from somewhere grabbed me really tight. He was acting as if he doesn't care at all. He doesn't care whether he is cool or the audience will like him or the film means anything to him or even the world will be collapesed tomorrow. What ever. That was his attitude.
 And that was cool.

Also all the other actresses are so beautiful and talented. And knowing the fact that they are all well known- kind of- was a bit surprised.
 Lucy Gordon acted for Jane Birkin, Laetitia Casta for Brigitte Bardot, Anna Mouglalis for Juliette Grco, Sara Forestier France Gall. They all were Serge's lover and most of them were very famous actors or singers.

The thing is Eric is not a promiscuous Casanova type of a guy but he happens to have a lot of different lovers during his career. And he loved them all so dearly.

As talking about his life, he was born as a Jew and becomes a Jazz singer to an iconic pop star. He suffered from alcohlic and smoked cigarrette too much but I don't think he was miserable.
 He was a humorous delightful guy that everyone loved especially women.

The movie was filled with beautifully shot images and great music sang by the actor Eric Elmosnino himself and the orchestra joined sometimes.
 The music done by Olivier Daviaud which I don't know much but he did it really well and it was almost as great as the famous the Michel Legrand.
 It really made the movie even more better.

As I told you before especially Laetitia Casta for Brigitte Bardot, Anna Mouglalis for Juliette Grco, two actresses were really charming and they were supporting the main actor very well. The three main actors are something that I remembered even after the movie was finished.

Also as I mentioned, the cartoon images and the appearance of the cartoon charactor following allthorugh the movie was a positive stream for this movie. It was kind of comic.

There was only one serious moment when Gainsbourg shot the real gun to the toy doll in front of his daughter for real and the first wife was freaked out and asked him for a divorce. After that I cannot remember any seriousness from this movie.

Just relax and you can enjoy the great music and storys of the great artist story.

8436733,5,B004NJR516,"Captivating biopic directed by French director, novelist, comics artist Joann Sfar.

If Gainsbourg was a river that ran deep in your world, if he was part of your cultural fabric, you will fall in love with the film, grateful that he has been recreated--beautifully--, that you can spend two hours in his company again, trying to puzzle out what happened to him. I loved witnessing once again the remarkable eloquence of this man of letters, his musical and poetic genius, his cutting wit, cheekiness, poker face, understated singing style, the subversiveness that was present from the outset, his vulnerability, his antics, drunken debauchery, quiet rage, the ears, the hooter, the string of alluring and high-profile women...

Each episode blends into the next seamlessly - a rare feat in a biopic.

8436735,5,B004NJR516,"I came to view this film via the somewhat oblique route of tracking down movies featuring the lovely Euro uber Model/Actress: Laetitia Casta. As a North American resident my only previous awareness of Serge Gainsbourg was through his (back in the day) romantic/musical connections to Brigitte Bardot (of whom I, among millions of others, am a big fan!) - I knew he was a French singer/composer and pretty goofy looking and that was about 'it'.  Since this film featured the gorgeous Ms Casta playing BB I just had to check it out!  In retrospect - I'm glad I did - because not only did it provide one of the most satisfying filmic turns for Laetitia that I've seen to date, but it also provided a fascinating introduction to a European mega pop star of prodigious talent and personality.

It might be noted that this DVD offering is a 2 disk set - the second disk contains a 20 min featurette on the 'Director' of the film - French artist Joann Sfar.  Sfar is apparently a huge fan of Gainsbourg and he previously produced a 'graphic novel' that chronicled Serge's life, and upon which he based this, his (premiere!) film making effort. The images of Sfar sketching in his own artistic notebooks mirror Gainsboug's own early forays into art (which he ultimately abandoned in favor of music) and demonstrate the degree to which his art was influenced by Gainsbourg.

Altho this is an inaugural Directorial outing for Sfar it certainly doesn't show - the film is not only thoroughly professional in every aspect but unusually inventive in how it presents its' story. The lead actor (Eric Elmosnino ) who portrays the adult Gainsbourg is excellent in the role and all of the actresses who play his lofty love interests are equally attractive and entrancing - as noted: Laetitia makes a very convincing BB!  The movie covers a lot of ground - conveying pretty much all the notable stages of Gainsbourg's life: from precocious adolescent, through his pop ascendancy, into ultimate superstar burnout.  One can imagine that Euro-viewers of this biopic would be humming along with the string of musical 'hits' that are portrayed within the film, as the plot & years progress.  While N. American audiences might not have this same 'connection' to the material - the film still provides an engrossing and interesting experience and introduction to a major musical talent.  I really enjoyed it!  Technically - the film is presented in widescreen format - French language w/ English subs - numerous 'extras'.",1389571200,,2496,4.879432624113475
