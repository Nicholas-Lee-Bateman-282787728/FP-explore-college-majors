To me, Fred Wolf has a unique voice in those who are speaking about the quantum field. I love his expressions, his way of explaining this information and his compassion for humans, and the human experience we are all sharing as we use the field, whether we are using it consciously or not. I can't recommend this highly enough. Thanks, Fred!  I'm out there, poppin' my quiff... :-) making my life my masterpiece each day. xooxox",1412899200,,594,4.711538461538462

If you are on a journey to not only find answers but, to win over your ego. Then this is another small piece of the puzzle.
Read his book... which was excellent.",1355097600,2,393,4.3108108108108105
