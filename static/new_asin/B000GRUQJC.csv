2616059,5,B000GRUQJC,"I'm glad to read that this is show is finally available...

The main reason I'm posting though is that I wanted to point out that above it's listed as 1 disc and 110 min runtime.  I looked it up on the Warner Bros site, and it's actually 2 discs, 220 minutes total runtime, which is a total of 10 episodes.",1158883200,15,306,4.083333333333333
2616060,5,B000GRUQJC,"When this show was on a few years ago, I always made time to sit down and watch it. It didn't have a script, or a plot, or acting. But, nevertheless, it was vastly entertaining, and, for my money, more funny than most sitcoms that were out at the time. Whose Line Is It Anyway? was always better viewed with some of your friends helplessly howling with you, while simultaneously marvelling at the quick wits and inventiveness of the cast. Now, I've never been much of a Drew Carey fan; he doesn't really make me laugh. But he was the main reason the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? was put on the airwaves, so, for this, he gets my thanks.

Whose Line Is It Anyway? was an improvisational comedy show which had British roots; it used the premise of a game show as a framework, with a host and a panel of four participants, except that, in this game show, the points don't really matter and the winner is arbitrarily chosen by Drew Carey. As host, Carey got to choose the scenario or ""game"" the players would play. All in all, the cast was wondrously dependable in their ability to tickle our funny bone. These guys were excellent ad-libbers. I did feel, however, that the segment where the ""winner"" gets to do something with Drew near the episode's end was almost always a let down. I'm not sure if this is because of my antipathy towards Drew or because Drew just isn't that good at improvising.

What made the show work was that the contestants were genuinely funny performers; add to that the fact that three of the participants were regulars, which gave 'em the chance to get in sync with each other comedically, resulting, almost paradoxically, in a tighter, improvisational style of levity. Discounting Drew, there were three regulars: Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and Wayne Brady. Stiles and Mochrie had great chemistry together and were quick-thinking funnymen who were equally adept with the quip or  the occasional physical comedy. Personally, I thought Colin Mochrie was the funniest one of all. Wayne Brady was a genius with the impromptu lyrics and a good singer, to boot. With his congenial personality, you could see how he got his own show.

The fourth seat was reserved for a rotating guest list, the most often used of whom were the smartly glib Greg Proops, the amiable Chip Esten, and the goofy-expressioned Brad Sherwood. Stunt guests included Robin Williams and Whoopie Goldberg (who tanked), and even Stephen Colbert guest starred in two episodes. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that British comedienne Josie Lawrence, in particular, was always a delight and gave Wayne Brady a run for his money in the tunes department. In the original British Whose Line, Josie often tore up the crowd with her ad lib song renditions.

The most popular games played were ""Let's Make a Date,"" ""Superheroes,"" ""Newscasters,"" ""Party Quirks,"" ""Questions Only,"" ""Helping Hands,"" and the dreaded ""Hoedown"" (which Mochrie loathed). My favorites games were ""Scenes from a Hat"" (participants would enact audience-written scenarios drawn from a hat), ""Props"" (the players are given props, which they must find a funny use for), ""Mission: Impossible"" (often with Mochrie and Styles, who enact spy capers), ""Narrate"" (again Mochrie and Styles, who channel film noir), ""Three-Headed Broadway Star"" (three of 'em join in a song, whilst taking turns singing only one word at a time), ""Greatest Hits"" (usually with Wayne Brady singing quick snippets about a product Drew selects, with hilarious promotional intros by two others of the cast), and ""Song Styles"" (Wayne Brady must improvise and serenade an audience member to a song style suggested by the audience).

Heads up to the consumer: there will be two versions of this dvd released. There's the censored version (which is what we saw on tv) and the uncensored version (which, to me, is the one to get). Both dvds will contain the first 10 episodes of Season One, complete with outtakes. Hopefully, there are more bonus features included.

Reruns of this show is still on at times on cable television, but, now,  that's not good enough anymore. Hopefully, in due time, we'll see the release of all the episodes, of the U.S. and British versions both. Until then, this isn't a bad start.",1158624000,13,4262,4.852819807427785
2616061,5,B000GRUQJC,"I first became aware of ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"" through the reruns of the original British version on Comedy Central. Though Clive Anderson (the original host) was not as funny as Drew Carey, he had a knack for delivering witty barbs and insults. Then, in 1998, the show came to America (apparently, we wanted it and bought it).  Clive Anderson came with it, but after a handful of episodes, he was replaced with Drew Carey. I guess the stuffed suits in the studio thought that American audiences would relate better to an American host.

Most episodes of the American ""Whose Line"" star Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, and Drew Carey, with a fourth actor rotating in and out. These usually consisted of Greg Proops (a frequent guest on the British 'Whose Line'), Chip Esten (also occasionally on the British), Brad Sherwood (also seen in UK), Kathy Greenwood, and Denny Siegel, though there were also appearances by Ian Gomez (Larry Almada on 'The Drew Carey Show'), Steven Colbert (yes, THE Steven Colbert!), Kathy Kinney (Mimi on 'The Drew Carey Show'. You can see her here without makeup!), and my all-time favorite, Josie Lawrence, a frequent participant in the British 'Whose Line', whose comic genius and musical abilities made an excellent complement to Wayne's on the American.  Though many women have appeared on ""Whose Line"" since it first debuted in the UK, Josie, IMHO, is the ""Whose Line Diva"".

The cast participates in various improv games, and improved songs, most of which set the audience roaring in laughter (and me too!), especially in one of the most popular games, ""Hoedown"", one of the remnants from the UK's version.  I have every intention of adding both versions of this release to my collection, and intend to purchase every ""Whose Line"" DVD release, which hopefully will be frequent. :)  And not just the American, but let's get the British ""Whose Line"" over here too! Comedy Central has stopped airing them to make room for ""Mad TV"" and ""The Daily Show"", which are not my taste.",1155945600,82,2019,4.871720116618076
2616062,5,B000GRUQJC,The moment that I've learned that the DVD will be released soon I was like Colin & Ryan doing the sound effects of a very happy man who just learned the show will be released on DVD soon! This is just wonderful news. No matter how bad your day is just watch few moments from the show and try your laughing limits. Thanks to everyone who worked on this project.,1154476800,7,360,4.1571428571428575
2616063,5,B000GRUQJC,"I love Whose Line, so just before this show was released, I pre-ordered the Uncensored version.  I loved the special features it had, it was very entertaining and hilarious but...I found out there is more to it.

I found out when I bought the Censored version that there are different special features on the Censored disc 2.

Never Before Seen Outtakes for the Censored version disc 2.

1) Film, TV and Theatre Styles

2) Sound Effects

3) Shopping From Home

4) Bar Scene

5) Foreign Film Dub

6) Animals

Never Before Seen Outtakes for the Uncensored version disc 2.

1) Questions Only

2) Scenes From a Hat

3) Animals

4) Duet

5) Bar Scene

6) Greatest Hits

The Bar Scene and Animals are the same suggestion on both versions.  But the Uncensored version shows more on what happened while they did Bar Scene.  And the Gag Reels are pretty much the same except the uncensored version has more to show than the censored version.  But really not suitable for children.",1154304000,,971,4.6
2616064,5,B000GRUQJC,"This show is hilarious.  Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and Wayne Brady are phenominally talented, and kudos to Drew Carey for bringing an American version of this British comedy show to the U.S.  This show is a wonderful way to introduce family and friends to the world of improvisation and creativity. Why ABC ever stopped producing this show is a mystery.  Thank goodness Whose Line continues to air on ABC Family. I imagine the censorered version would be better for homes with younger children, while the uncensored version would be better for homes with older or no children. If you haven't seen this show, have only caught a couple of episodes, or are a huge fan, this DVD is a must.",1153958400,4,687,4.708333333333333

You get 10 episodes from the first season which, after skimming out the endless explanations of each game, comes down to about two and a half hours of actual footage. Some of the earlier-numbered shows are only chuckle-worthy, which is probably why they're not in numerical order on the discs. Most of the fourth-chair guest comedians aren't even worth watching (with the exception of regulars Greg and Brad).

Since they insisted on taking the show off the air, where do we start a petition to get these four into the movies? (Colin and Ryan especially ... they have the makings on a classic comedic team!)

2. What kind of business plan is this?!?

Here are all these people (present company included) are are ready, willing and able to buy the entire show on DVD, and the company that owns the rights (ABC?) releases ... a few shows from the first year. What a marvelous business plan ... NOT selling products to customers who want them!

(I know that's what everyone says, but it's true this time). It's lots of fun and absolutely brilliant. Otherwise you should buy the unsencored version. It's the same as the sencored one + gag reels with som material that were sencored in the first place.

Yes, these are so funny you can watch them over again (it is a rarity that repeat viewing happens; I have a closet full of DVDs that I've watched once or not even at all).

They're quick-thinking comedians who act, do impersonations, impressions, and sing, and they develop innocent ideas into whimsically funny situations. The show was popular for a simple reason: this is an example of real adult entertainment. They don't run to the toilet every two minutes, yet they don't avoid sex or anything that happens to the average Jo. They focus on human experience and the often absurd nature of human interaction and the human condition. It's often silly, but it's also witty and fresh and unpretentious.

It would seem to me that there must be a way for adults only to get into the area of those types of DVD's.  I would hope that you would work on this as I believe its important.  I wouldn't think that Amazon wants that type of material to be easily acceptable.

The US version has less of that forced look to it and the guests really look as though they are enjoying it. The winner is Drew Carey as he is sat back watching his friends try to make him laugh. Ryan Styles and Colin Mochrie are two of the best and both have that class that distingiushes the show. Funny and a great buy.,1168819200,,492,4.030612244897959

Why not the entire first season?  Most other tv series' on DVD come in entire seasons, so why not this one?  The fact that it's called ""Season 1, Vol. 1"" gives us hope that there will be more, but when will the next one be coming out?  The dvd set's website doesn't say anything about any future installments.  I would much rather get the whole season all at once then have to wait over a long period of time for them to come out in 10-episode installments.  Please Warner Video, give us entire seasons!  Or at least give us half a season instead of just 10 eps!  On the plus side, they are pretty good episodes, and the extras, which include 10 never-aired games and 2 gag reels, are good.  The gag reels are especially hilarious.  (Note: on the uncensored version, it's only the extras that are uncensored; the actual episodes are still censored.)  It's still a good dvd set of a very hilarious show, but the paucity of episodes are the main reason for my average 3-star rating.

While the actual episodes shown are the ones that made it to air, as they were on the air, Disk 2 has the uncensored stuff on it, and it is GREAT!!

2616576,4,B000GRUQJC,"This hysterical show is one of the few cases of the good use of a European concept for American television. The improv comedy unleashed by the talented cast can be surprisingly subversive and satirical, and Wayne Brady and Colin Mochrie in particular are truly brilliant improvisers. For those in a certain comedic frame of mind, Whose Line will keep in you in stitches guaranteed. But with all that being said, I agree with some of the other reviewers here in that the original TV show is 5-star, but this DVD package deserves lesser praise. There are just two very under-packed discs with a disappointingly meager selection of material. This ""Volume 1"" set offers just ten episodes from the first season of the show, and there is no info booklet or episode guide at all. As for bonus material, there are a mere six deleted scenes and two ""gag reels"" of bloopers and outtakes.

This is all perfectly uproarious for the enthusiastic Whose Line fan, and the brilliant cast will surely justify your love. But alas, the minimalism of this set is a bit of a disappointment. There is little reason why the entire first season shouldn't be offered in a more robust three- or four-disc set, with similar packages for subsequent seasons. This arrangement would probably also be more affordable than the cumulative cost of the multiple smaller sets that will become necessary if the producers plan to release the entire series in the current fashion. Now don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the steady helping of laughs delivered by the Whose Line cast. But there should be more courses to this meal. You have to wonder if there will someday be a ""deluxe edition"" that will combine the smaller DVD packages like this one into something more useful and informative for the fans.

2616577,5,B000GRUQJC,My family enjoys watching WLIIA on TV. Could not wait for it to come out on DVD. Had to get it when it came out. It is just great. The Uncensored parts had us rolling with laughter. Great DVD. Just wish they would bring back the show.,1167782400,,234,4.0
2616578,5,B000GRUQJC,"I have always loved this show.  This uncensored dvd was so worth the money.  I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes!!",1167782400,,120,3.9583333333333335
2616579,3,B000GRUQJC,"Same skits over and over with different dialogue...  But very funny and worth watching.

I never really got into the television series, but thought I'd give it a try on DVD (I hate commercials).  The skits are funny and they guys on the show are hilarious.  The only problem is that they had no real diversity in the skits.  It was the same ones over and over.  I'm hoping that season two has a little more diversity in their acts.

But, this is a very entertaining show, and I laughed.  And, isn't that the point?",1167004800,,514,4.336842105263158
2616580,5,B000GRUQJC,"I ordered this dvd a few days ago and can't wait to see it. I have seen the Gag Reels on YouTube and can't wait to see them without being kinda choppy.(I have cable internet and am thrilled to get even faster cable in a cpl. days) I ut the gag reels and a few clips I found online on my myspace page. I hope they release all the episodes uncensored in the next release. I was hoping the episodes weren't censored. I was assuming they weren't, but I read on here that they were. It's misleading to the viewers by saying this is ""uncensored""...at least the gag reels are...I am giving it 5 stars just because it is FINALLY on dvd and we get to see all the outtakes from one of the funniest shows on earth!! I have been a HUGE fan ever since I saw the original version on Comedy Central years ago...now I watch the original on BBC America...I prefer Clive to Drew, but they are both funny..Clive was funnier in the later seasons of the show and Drew seemed nervous during the early seasons of the US show. Anywho, I'm thrilled to get to watch this anytime I wish and hope they add fmore episodes in future releases and also read that the UK version is soon to be released next year... I hope they have plenty of outtakes as well.",1166313600,,1226,4.1991525423728815
2616581,1,B000GRUQJC,"This is a great show, but the makers of this DVD completely disregarded any english-speaking deaf or hard of hearing viewers.  There are subtitles in Spanish and French--gee thanks.  My sister is deaf and loves this show.  I bought her the DVD as a surprise.  Now she can't really watch it.  What a disappointment.",1165622400,6,314,4.7407407407407405
2616582,3,B000GRUQJC,"....we all know how funny the show is (that's a given) so I couldn't wait to see the unedited versions. The ""F"" word is tossed around quite a bit but just saying that doesn't make it funny. I expected FUNNY unedited bits. I wonder if any of the cast members had any input in what went into this DVD? I still love the show but I do hope that the next set to be released has more ""unedited"" stuff that actually is funny.",1164672000,4,418,4.048192771084337
2616583,4,B000GRUQJC,"I am not going to bother reviewing the show here. If you don't know what a great show this is you are either brain dead or haven't seen it. If you haven't seen it check your local listings and check it out for yourself. The DVD extras have the uncensored parts. I expected a bit more extras but it is still a great DVD to own.

My only real complaint, hence 4 and not 5 stars, is the audio. There seems to be a big gap between the volume of the performers and the audience. I have to turn the volume up a bit in order to fully hear the performers. But then when the audience applauds and/or laughs it is way to loud. Hopefully future installments are not like this.

If you like to laugh this is a must. I hope they release the BBC version as well.",1162944000,5,748,4.0134228187919465
2616584,3,B000GRUQJC,"This uncensored version comes with 2 discs. I've played sections of both discs and it appears that the audio is slightly ahead of the video. It's not incredibly annoying, but it is disappointing.

Seeing the uncensored sections is amusing; For example, they show you clips where the ""censor guy"" comes out and warns Drew that they can't air a scene where Wayne Brady has fallen in love with a hamster.",1162425600,5,401,4.728571428571429
2616585,4,B000GRUQJC,"So is it Uncensored?  I just had to see for myself.

As I was going through all the episodes on the DVD, I asked my self ""how can it be uncensored when the original is already censored?"" And then it hit me. The Extra Features with the gag reel and deleted scenes ""are"" the uncensored part.

""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" is still a great show and I'm happy with the DVD they did a great job picking some great episode out of season 1, but more Extra Features would have been nice or at least a couple of more episodes would be nice too.

4 out of 5",1160956800,3,544,3.963302752293578
2616586,1,B000GRUQJC,"I was happy when Whose Line was coming out on DVD and uncensored I was going to purchase it, however when reading a couple of the other reviews and found out that the episodes are still censored, it was dissapointing. Needless to say I'm not going to waste my money on this DVD if I wanted to watch it censored I'd record it from ABC Family. I hope the makers of the DVD see this review and realize what a mistake they have made.",1159574400,5,429,4.119047619047619
2616587,4,B000GRUQJC,"Whose Line Is It Anyway? is my favorite show on television right now.  It's packed to the brim and overflowing with hilarious moments, great musical performances, and improvisational slip-ups.  Brilliance in its finest form.

So you can imagine my excitement when I heard that it was coming out on DVD.  I was dead set on getting the Uncensored version because, if you've watched the show as much as I have, you'd want to break out of the normal, FCC-monitored routine, too.  Something truly different.

This DVD is great, absolutely, but I have a few quips about it.  When I heard that the DVD was uncensored, along with the numerous adult content warnings, I expected hands-down, fully uninhibited content.  However, the episodes themselves are still censored.  There was only one censor in one episode on this DVD, though, and I don't believe it really had to be censored, either (I'll let you watch to see for yourself).  This doesn't give me much hope for future releases.

Also... a little too short.  10 episodes and some special features?  It's kind of disappointing that I got through this DVD in a few hours.  As short as this one was, and considering it's only Volume 1 of Season 1, they better come out one after another fast to hold my interest.

My favorite part of this DVD set was the special features.  I had been watching the same episodes over and over on TV, so seeing some outtakes really did it for me.  The gag reels are absolutely hilarious!  And uncensored!  You'll see plenty of the cast's obvious disdain for the director (lots of ""Hold, please"").  My favorite in the gag reel is the one where Greg is doing ""Let's Make A Date.""  I leave the watching up to you.

In summary, this DVD is wonderful.  A must have for any diehard fan of the show on TV.  But again, it's a little short, so it'll probably spend most of the time on your shelf.  But it's a great addition to any TV-on-DVD collection.",1159488000,13,1921,4.579411764705882
2616588,5,B000GRUQJC,"The show gets 5 stars... but I give Warner Bros. 3 stars for the way they marketed and released this show.  ONE: the UNCENSORED version is ONLY regarding the bonus features.  You WILL still hear the beeps and the word 'censored' over certain hand gestures, etc. on the episodes.  There is only one example of this on this set and that is the very last episode during Hoedown where Ryan Stiles makes a reference to 'using my right hand'(which is beeped).  TWO: not releasing the entire season is a letdown.  So we have to pay full price for a half season? To me that is a litte annoying and smacks of greed.  THREE: The episode list is confusing.  There are 5 episodes on each disc.  Do they say ""episode 1"", ""episode 2"", etc? Noooooo.  They say -for example- Episode 106, episode 102, episode 111, etc.  So somewhere they did a lot of slicing and dicing before they first aired this show back in 1998.  I hope Warner Bros. looks at these reviews because I would like to see these things fixed in future DVD sets.  Otherwise, the show is great and funny as it always was and the gag reels is hillarious.  20 minutes of goofs up and Ryan pleading(or acting up) for a restroom break, etc. LOL.  I didn't realise so much work went into filming this show... you will see what I mean if you watch the Gag reels.  Great show but Please release entire seasons!  And get the cast to do some sort of 'making of' or commentaries!",1159315200,32,1418,4.375478927203065
2616589,4,B000GRUQJC,"The last decade have really brought out some of the most interesteing and exciting television shows, especially from overseas. With so many different shows like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, American Idol, and Survivor as current mainstream success on televsion today that were strong in Britain for years, there are very few that still show as fun and enjoyable as they were originally released. That is the case with Whose Line Is It Anyway? The improve show which began in Great Britain with host comedy writer Clive Anderson, has been making audiences worldwide since the late 80's. The show tackled uncharted waters with Drew Carey as host in the late 90's in America, could the show hit more laughs than before?

Whose Line Is It Anyway? Season 1 Volume 1, is a double disc DVD set featuring the first shows of this ABC classic, which also has shown a lot of promise in reruns on ABC Family within the past five years. The original shows feature constants Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles who played Lewis on The Drew Carey Show, as well as classic semi-regulars Greg Proops, Brad Sherwood and Wayne Brady, before he became a full time panelist like Ryan and Colin. The episodes are hilarious, and still deliver with laughter and hilarious games from the popular hoedown, Weird Newscasters and Party Quirks where one perfomer tries to figure out the others silly secrets, and lesser-played ones like Telethon and Daytime Talk Show which was mainly only featured only in the first year. The episodes have all been restored, and still are just as funny as they were originally debuted years ago.

Although there have been spinoffs from Blue Collar TV with Jeff Foxworthy, to Last Comic Standing which have brought new spins from reality shows with comics, Whose Line Is It Anyway? is one of the funniest shows ever on television. I just wish that there could've been more shows highlighted here on this DVD, but hopefully there will be more editions coming out soon. If you haven;t yet seen this great show from here, or overseas, than I definitely suggest you buy this great DVD and add it to your collection.
