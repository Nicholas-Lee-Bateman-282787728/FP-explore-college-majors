8120153,3,B000FBHCLO,"Beautiful cinematography and the talented Grazyna Szapolowska do not redeem a ludicrous plot. The mission is to get some vital WW1 documents from Russia to Stockholm via a courier taking a train journey.  I couldn't shake off memories of a train journey episode of Get Smart which was actually intended to be ludicrous. The Venus trap is glaringly obvious and the behaviour of the two protagonists towards each other makes no sense in either a love story or an espionage adventure. For all that, the film is a visual treat from beginning to end.",1522540800,,545,4.797872340425532
