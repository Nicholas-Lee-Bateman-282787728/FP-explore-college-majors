Can it really be done in 60 minutes? Yes it can...with time to spare. As an experienced PowerPoint User (100's of presentations)the challenge is not the content. The challenge is the design, the look.

I have been through the material twice and have a a distinctive template that now shouts individuality rather than Microsoft.

The information on working with slide master is easier to implement than any information that I have in four PP manuals. My increased confidence working with slide masters will save me hours and hours of work and by itself is worth many times the price. But then again, that is pretty much what I expect from Jim...he brings new meaning to the term ""over deliver""

Of all the online marketing ""gurus"" and experts, Jim Edwards is without doubt the best at teaching people how to actually do the things he recommends. When you've finished watching any of his lessons--including this DVD--you will know not only what you need to do, but HOW to do it.

There were two people, I decided who appeared wise, experienced and connected to with my own businesses' trajectory, struggles and hopes. One was Rich Schefren and the other Jim Edwards.

What makes Jim's teaching, in particular on something as technical as creating a PowerPoint presentation(I am VERY right-brained!), is he deals with the techie issues in plain talk that can be digested by a non-techie like myself AND it's a step-by-step.  That is SO key.

I see dozens of PowerPoint presentations weekly where I work. Though Microsoft provide templates, hardly anyone uses more than two of the default set.  The presentations start to have the same feel as Charlie Brown's teacher: ""Wa wawa wa, wawawa wa...""

Jim Edwards' approach is going to light up your presentation and help it stand out in the crowd.  These days, that's an edge you need.

Each time I do this, people ask me where I got the background that was a custom fit to my presentation theme. They are usually surprised when I tell them I made it in about 10 minutes.  And now I'll steer them here when they want to know how!",1232496000,,899,4.58125

I know and use PowerPoint and even I was amazed at Jim's ability to make you comfortable with a software program even if you've NEVER touched PowerPoint previously.  Yes, he taught me a few things too.

Most people that want to learn PowerPoint will look for a book, which they'll buy and put on a shelf for when there's a convenient time, then the book sits on the shelf.  Instead of a book, pick up this DVD and I promise you'll feel comfortable and knowledgeable about the product within one hour.  Watch the DVD and press pause, power up PowerPoint and do exactly what Jim does.

You'll learn what's wrong with most PowerPoint presentations, and what you must do and what you must never do.  You'll know where to get images and how to position them, you'll learn the secret to efficiency, which is building a template once and using it again and again.  You'll be comfortable with graphs and charts.  You'll know the all-important MASTER slide template and how to let it fix all your pages for you.  Should you use a light background or a dark one?  How many lines should you use, how big should your fonts be?  You'll know more about fonts than most people ever know.

I can't imagine a tutorial that can get you up to speed faster than this...Jim's tips and tricks will be ones you can amaze your co-workers with.  But keep these secrets to yourself, it's better for job security to be more expert at PowerPoint than everyone else.  And Jim's DVD will get you to expert status in an hour.

In 3+ years of studying internet marketing techniques, I have never encountered a teacher who delivers more information as clearly as Jim Edwards. After this course, I can sit down at my computer and produce a compelling presentation (something I had never done before) with confidence. And much of this information was useful in many other ways as well.

3719720,5,B001NMT8Q6,"As a trainer and consultant, the most effective way I find new clients is with live and recorded presentations. I'm now doing 3-4 new presentations per month. Quite honestly, working with PowerPoint 2007 has been a dreaded time-sucking nightmare...until now.

This DVD has saved me hours upon hours of hair pulling. With the simple, straightforward guidance on this single DVD, I'm creating MUCH slicker slides in 1/3 of the time! I've especially found the streamlined set up of the Master Slides incredibly helpful. I can even now create my own polished, custom templates that are consistent with my company image to use over and over again. In just a few minutes, I can do what used to take hours of wrestling with graphics, animation and consistency. This DVD has been a real life saver for me! It doesn't get much easier than this.

3719722,5,B001NMT8Q6,"If your time is important to you and you want to create great products in just a few hours, ""How to Create Killer Powerpoint Presentations"" really hits the mark! I'd been struggling with creating Powerpoint Video products for months. I took this course and literally created my first video powerpoint presentation in 48 minutes. Shortly after that I had it posted to my web site and helping build my business. I have since saved countless hours creating very high quality Video Products using exactly the techniques taught in ""How to Create a Killer Powerpoint Presentation.""

Jim Edwards is an extraordinary teacher and he provides everything you need to know to create video Powerpoint Presentations that are a step above almost anything else you will find out there. That means a huge competitive edge in the marketplace if you are selling products. His step-by-step guidance makes this simple, easy and incredibly quick.

I wish I had this information earlier for it would have saved me a lot of time, and I would have created a better product. Rather than go on and on, let me just say I think anybody interested in creating effective powerpoint presentations would be silly to miss out on what Jim has to teach for I know personally they will find tremendous value purchasing this DVD.",1232409600,,508,4.532608695652174

My recommendation to anyone who needs to do PowerPoint presentations: ignore the instructions, templates, etc., that come with PowerPoint. They only teach you how to dull, boring, mind-numbing presentations filled with distracing glitz. Ignore the free tutorials on the Web. They only recycle the instructions that come with PowerPoint.

I'm an experienced computer user, but sometimes you just don't get the time to learn everything a new program can do.  I watched Jim's presentation on Powerpoint, and in one go created a powerpoint master slide that I've used in a presentation, webpage and on my first sellout DVD (just sold out in six hours).
Straightforward, honest, human, highly skilled, and caring about his audience. Everything you would want a good teacher to be. Thanks Jim, here's to the next one.",1232409600,,581,5.315217391304348

8327397,5,B001NMT8Q6,"I stumbled across this video quite by accident while browsing Amazon Instant Video.  I use PowerPoint at work to create presentations and have had training on it and consider myself an intermediate user of most Microsoft Office 2007 & 2010 products.  I had read of the Master Slides but had never tried using them.  I followed along as the author creates a presentation and immediately used his techniques to create two different presentations--in much less time than I would have previously taken for one!

I picked up a few other new techniques such as grouping two objects together also.  This is definetely worth the price of the rental.  It's sort of a cookie-cutter approach but if you follow his advice and experiment around then the quality of your PowerPoint presentations will improve.  He has some reasonable advice on design too.

The last 45 minutes of the video is an interview with a graphic designer, which I did not find that interesting--I was too anxious to get started making a presentation!  Even if you don't watch the interview the first part of the video is worth the money!

Will you benefit from this video?  If you do not understand and use the technique of the Master Slide, then yes, you will greatly benefit.  If you already use them and feel comfortable with them, then I bet you already know the other techniques also.",1344729600,,1350,4.771551724137931

8327400,4,B001NMT8Q6,I recently saw a presentation by someone and I could immediately notice Mr Edwards techniques at work.  I really like his approach and his methods work (especially after seeing someone else use them effectively)  He does state that you can make your own presentation template but the I'm no graphic artist and I think it really requires someone with this skill to create a template for you that establishes your 'brand',1277683200,,419,4.887323943661972
