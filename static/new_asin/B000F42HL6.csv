I still haven't seen Yellow Hair 1.",1371772800,,289,4.37037037037037

8117070,4,B000F42HL6,"The first and as yet only time I saw this film was on VHS with no subtitles back in 2002. It was so bizarre and brilliant in a disjointed, insane and stylized way that I had been searching for it ever since. It's essentially about a trio of dysfunctional(in all ways) young people who get themselves tangled in manslaughter, blackmail, gun violence, suicide, murder, and karaoke. Oh and the main character is a bisexual transgender man/woman. I didn't know that watching the film without subtitles though, which I suppose is a triumph for her (formerly his) surgeon. Before finding the actual title of this film I could only sum it up as ""The Violent Adventures of Bisexual Snapple Bitch 2"" which pretty much describes the arch of the film.",1205193600,2,740,4.744186046511628
