2607888,5,B000GFRI68,"This series combined wonderful performances of consumate actors with subtle exploration of timeless issues. My oldest daughter is now the age that I was when the series ran and would be as charmed by the stories as I was then. The richness and complexity of the ""everyday"" characters and the stresses they face is warmed by the underlying mutual love and respect they share. They create a family more real and dear to my household than the Waltons!",1140566400,7,448,4.756410256410256
2607889,5,B000GFRI68,"I have been buying DVDs of old VHS tapes of this show from Ebay for awhile now and I am amazed at how well this show holds up. From the directors who worked on ""thirtysomething"" this stuff is top notch. The scripts are incredibly sensitive (especially the first few shows from the first season, like the episode ""Thursday's Child"" where the family tries to make peace with the death of their youngest, Timmy, while preparing for Nancy's newborn's Chirstening is heartwrenching and more real than most ""reality"" television I have seen in the past few years.) The acting is nothing less than superb. Although I am a big fan of Kristy McNichol and she turns in many great performances here, it is Sada Thompson as Kate Lawrence that really offers viewing magic with a really rich and full presence onscreen; she gives such reality and weight to her role. This is just great, quality television; completely satisfying.

I can only hope that extras include comentary by the cast, especially Kristy McNichol!

2607904,5,B000GFRI68,"I was a teenager when Family first aired and found the program's  controversial topics as well as the cast and their acting
to be ground breaking for the 1970s.  Sada Thompson and James Broderick (was the father of actor Matthew Broderick)
were absolutely superb in their roles and Kate and Doug Lawrence.  Kristy McNichol, Gary Frank and Meredith Baxter Birney
also gave excellent performances in their roles as supporting cast.

The series' musical score, including the beautiful theme  used in the opening credits, was written by actor/composer John Rubenstein, who like his more famous father, composer Arthur Rubenstein, had a talent for composing.

Rubenstein also played the role of Jeff Maitland, husband of the Lawrence's eldest daughter, Nancy.

Elaine Heilveil,  played the character  Nancy Lawrence Maitland, eldest daughter of Kate and Doug, for the first few episodes, and was later replaced by Meredith Baxter Birney.  Helveil  was excellent in her role, so the reason for her replacement remains to be seen.

However,  Birney was also excellent in the role.

Many well known Hollywood actors of the day made cameo appearances on Family, and a number of young up and coming actors
also appeared, including:  Tommy Lee Jones,  Michael J. Fox,  Blair Brown,  Willie Ahmes,  and Dina Manoff (daughter of actress Lee Grant).

This series was very well received  and  Sada Thompson,  Gary Frank,  and Kristy McNichol each one Emmys  for their performances.

In 1986 an effort was made to capitalize on the success of Family, which ran from 1976 to 1980, with the creation of a TV mini series
called ""A Year In The Life.""  The series starred Eva Marie Saint and Richard Kiley,  along with a number of lesser known, yet very talented actors, including Amanda Peterson,  Sarah Jessica Parker,  Richard Oliver, Adam Arkin (son of actor Alan Arkin) and  Wendy Phillips.

The mini series won an Emmy and spawned a TV series in 1988 also entitled  ""A Year In The Life,""  which  while excellent, only lasted for 22 episodes.  The series could have, and would have succeeded had NBC not made the foolish mistake of moving it from a
successful time slot where the show garnered respectable ratings,  to another, in which to compete with the Olympics.  This would be a fatal  move for the cast of A Year In The Life, since the show was not renewed for the 1989 season.

Unfortunately,  some of the promising young actors in this series, including the beautiful and incredibly talented Amanda Peterson,  found their careers in a tailspin, after A Year In The Life ended,  in which they were unable to obtain roles in quality productions in the future.

This led to abbreviated careers which should have been much longer.  Amanda Peterson, in particular had become an overnight
sensation when the movie she co-starred  in with Patrick Dempsey, entitled  Can't Buy Me Love,  became the sleeper Hollywood
hit of 1987.

Peterson became a teen idle with millions of fans all over the world,  who to this day wonder what happened to Amanda, and why her career did not skyrocket after Can't Be My Love.",1434326400,2,3093,4.9221789883268485

My disappointment was vast and memorable so when I found this set I couldn't wait to see if the series was really as great as I had thought. It is.
  Sada Thompson (Kate) gives a solid and true performance as the Mother of the family. She is the rock solid and loving anchor of the home--as most Mothers were back ""in the day."" James Broderick, the Father (Doug provides for and guides the family through the social issues of the times. The children, played by Meredith Baxter Birney (Nancy), Gary Frank (Willie), and Kristy McNichol (Buddy) work their way through the kinds of problems everyone faces in growing up--Nancy's divorce and being a single Mom, Willie's romances and career, Buddy's friendships and teen problems.

I can't say enough good things about this series.  I tried to make these episodes last for as long as I could because I didn't want to see them end.  Two things stuck out.  First, this show tackled some sensitive issues, especially considering the era in which it originally aired.  There are episodes about abortion, about being a single parent, about homosexuality, about dying family members and so on.  They are all well-written and tastefully done.  Very impressive.  Also, as the title of the show states, this is about a family and unlike most shows today about a ""family,"" this family feels real.  You often feel like a fly on the wall.  The interactions between family members feels real.  The dialogue feels authentic as do the emotions of each family member.  It's neither overly dramatic nor overly trite.

2607952,5,B000GFRI68,"When I was growing up, Christy McNichols was my ""pin-up"" girl. I also like the performance she pulled off on Family -- she was the ONLY reason I watched cause I didn't care about the stories...

Now, watching the first 3 episodes actually surprises me by how current the story points are with modernized issues -- the pilot gives a very good touch on marrital fidelity and percerverence along with why women who are thinking of having abortions should chose NOT to have them (done in a very respectable way).  and that was all in the pilot

Episode 2 deals with the fear of the woman of the home getting ""a lump"" in her breast and the fear such a finding can place on a family --

And still Ms McNichols performance was outstanding, reminding me of why I thought she was the perfect teen-ager pin-up girl of my time.",1358899200,,816,4.42

I have corresponded with an executive at Sony Pictures Entertainment who offered the following explanation:
""We did the necessary business research on this release. With regret, it appears that the business economics will make this prohibitive due to outside music clearance costs that are out of our control. Unless we could promise those outside music copyright owners that we would sell many thousands of sets, there's no way to do this.
We're ready to go. Maybe you can get 10,000 signatures for people as interested as you and it would give us a better argument.""

Careful and proper cleaning has made two of the marred discs playable, but the other 3 are a lost cause.  There are no scratches or any other mechanical defects, just some faint streaky marks which prevent the DVD player from reading the surface.

Dear Ms. Smith:

Thank you for the standard policy response you sent me regarding my disappointment in your marketing strategies.  Again, Sony continues to ignore our concerns and dissatisfaction by addressing our input with standard, template responses.

You state that you ""currently do not have a published release date for this title."" You do not say why you continue to put out incomplete DVD sets.

I have lost confidence in the products you put out on the market, and your response reinforces the fact that you have no intentions of changing your marketing strategies in order to satisfy the consumer's interests.

I will not purchase incomplete DVD series from Sony again.

Respectfully,

Nilsa Pagan

Willy is everything a brother should be. And I always wanted to be like Buddy. I was sad that Kristy McNichol didn't do more that we got to see here in Australia. I don't know what other stuff she did in America but I remember hearing she had typical problems that most child actors had at that time.

The DVD included the first and second seasons, and as I watched the series of tapes, I was transported back to another time and place.

I remembered who I was and what I was doing then.  I was a young mother, a social worker, and a graduate student (working on my master's degree in counseling).  My life was poised on the threshold of a future that I had envisioned.

Now, watching the series long after those years had unfolded, I recalled those moments and the feelings I held.  The dreams.  Even though my life had changed directions a few times, I could still feel what I felt back then.

This recapturing of special moments is probably the best reason to watch something from the past:  recalling who we were then, and studying the pathway that led to who we are now.

The voices of the characters spoke to me with an echo of poignant nostalgia.  We can never go back, nor do we really want to do so, but to remember is to recapture a piece of who we were.

2607980,5,B000GFRI68,"If you were a fan of or familiar with Kristy McNichol in the '70s,'80s and part of the 90s, then I'm sure you knew of ""Family"". This was a groundbreaking show for it's time ('76-'80), yet it still exhibited the cohesiveness of the average middle-class family through it's struggles, triumphs and tragedies. The creative forces coupled with the fine acting made this show a true masterpiece. While a somewhat simliar program ""Eight is Enough"" that I liked would run from 1977-81, Family was still my favorite.

I watched as much of this show as I could when it aired until the time it ended. It was simple in it's presentation, yet addressed a broad range of comtemporary issues that other shows were not as bold to breach during that period.

If this show were fast forwarded to today, I could imagine Kate scoffing at dinner-table texting, lol.

I haven't watched re-runs in years, but saw some clips on YouTube recently and it brought back a lot of memories. I intend to get the DVDs soon.

I remember having a crush on Kristy then and IMO, I always believed had she left Familiy before it's run, the show wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. It is a shame she has left the industry, but I admire her for wanting to play the biggest part of her life, which is Kristy. While I would welcome her return, I wish her well no matter what.

Family also laid the ground for many other dramatic and successful shows that would grace both the TV and pop culture such as Dallas, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest from the late 70s and into the '80s.

2607991,5,B000GFRI68,"I was only 6 years old when ""Family"" debuted; my mom adored it.  To my older siblings, it was one of the most boring things on television, and they protested loudly if my mom tried to watch it.  So my mom only watched ""Family"" when just she and I were home.  I remember that every episode seemed to be about weighty adult issues and was so talky.  UGH!  I just wanted to watch cartoons.

As an adult, I often enjoy weighty dramas, so I decided to try the first two seasons of ""Family"" on DVD.  Not surprisingly I had a very different reaction this time.  ""Family"" focuses on the Lawrence family of Pasadena, California.  Doug (James Broderick) is a successful attorney married for 25 years to Kate (Tony winner Sada Thompson).  The oldest child, Nancy (Meredith Baxter Birney) is a young newlywed with an infant (Timmy).  Willie (Gary Frank) has dropped out of high school and does little but hang around the house.  Finally, Buddy (Kristy McNichol) is a young teen tomboy struggling to find who she is.  The family lives in a terrific older house with rambling stairs that was passed down from Doug's father.

The Lawrences are an idealized family of sorts, but they also have problems.  During the first season, Nancy catches her husband cheating, and they soon divorce.  Likewise, the family frequently argues and has communication break downs.  However, in the end, they stick together and support each other.  I love the warmth between the family members; it sometimes threatens to become sticky sweet but remains realistic.  They're the kind of family many people wish they could have.  In particular, Sada Thompson is superb as the mother.  She is the perfect parent - warm and encouraging yet tough when she needs to be.

Like many 70s dramas, ""Family"" tends to be limited by its episodic nature.  Most episodes present a new problem that is more or less tidily wrapped up by the time the end credits run.  Too often, the storylines depend on a relative or an old friend from out of town reappearing and involving the family in some kind of drama.  So one week Willie's old friend who is wanted by the FBI drops into town and nearly gets Willie arrested, and the next week an old flame woos Nancy until she finds out he has a drug problem.  It just doesn't seem that realistic that an average family has this many old friends and relatives with problems who just happen to show up each week.  Today's television dramas do a much better job of creating storyline arcs that last several episodes and therefore seem more realistic.  However, this is a relatively minor quibble about what is otherwise an excellent drama.  I think ""Family"" will appeal to fans of other 70s family dramas, such as ""Eight is Enough.""

The first season of ""Family"" was presented as a miniseries; this set contains Seasons 1 and 2 - a total of 28 episodes.  The DVD set includes no extras.  So far seasons 3-5 have yet to appear three years after the release of this set; hopefully they will eventually be released on DVD.",1258848000,6,3005,4.64326375711575

And for all who still hesitate: buy this edition of the first two seasons. I promise: you won`t regret it. Really not! Just sit and enjoy!",1248048000,6,701,4.754098360655738

2607996,5,B000GFRI68,"I was just a kid when ""Family"" was shown on TV but I have fond memories of sitting with my family after dinner and watching this show. We used to watch so many quality shows those days - others being ""Little House on the Family"", ""Eight is Enough"" [which is yet to be released on DVD], ""The Waltons"" and many more.

When I look back, the themes covered in ""Family"" were rather radical for its time - adultery, divorce, homosexuality, drug addiction etc. And all this in a regular suburban family, the Lawrence's in America comprising attorney dad Doug[James Broderick], stay-at-home mother Kate[Sada Thompson], eldest daughter Nancy[played by Elayne Heilveil in Season 1 and Meredith Baxter-Birney in Season 2], high-school dropout son Willie[Gary Frank], and teen daughter Buddy[Kristy McNichol].

The writing is intelligent and economical, and the acting by all cast members is above average, especially by Sada Thompson as the stalwart mom. There are even familiar names amongst the guest stars such as Tommy Lee Jones, Helen Hunt, James Woods etc.

There's plenty of heart in ""Family"" and the stories manage to strike a chord in viewers even after all these years. It's rare to find such quality family-centered shows on TV these days and I'm so glad this show is out on DVD. I hope ""Eight is Enough"" will be released on DVD too.",1242518400,5,1333,4.889380530973451

The writing, the cast, the guest stars (who are almost all recognizable) are just brilliant.  I don't remember the show being funny back then, but now I laugh out loud fairly often.  I'm amazed at Sada Thompson's subtle and dry wit.  How lovable Kristy McNichol's Buddy is.  How beautiful John Rubenstein's theme music is.  Every episode is a gem, and I really hope that they release the other seasons.  This is one of the best family drama series of all time.",1239148800,5,621,4.3304347826086955

It is so unfair to the fans of a great show like 'Family'. When I saw the 1st & 2nd seasons come out on DVD, I ran to buy the set. I think I must have watched all the episodes within 2 days. I just love this show; it had interesting plots, great characters and true to life stories. I felt like I was 13 again. What a terrific show and to not continue with the entire show's run on DVD is extremely irritating- Why not just put the rest of the seasons out in one big set and end the debate. I would rather buy all the seasons at once then in dribs and drabs.... PLEASE! We need more 'Family'!!!",1229817600,22,837,3.9585798816568047
2608004,5,B000GFRI68,"I grew up on this show and remember loving it, but ironically I don't recall a single episode. So I bought this DVD set last week and have spent every night addicted, watching one or two episodes each evening.

This is a show that is both of its time, and still quite relevant. Why wouldn't it be, since drama, conflict and families are eternal? Be prepared to fall in love with these people.

""Family"" is headed by and stars Sada Thompson who is an aristocratic, dignified and funny mother.  There is a touch of Hollywood unreality to her, in the way she cleans her house, cooks meals and drives in high heels and dresses.  People who were not alive in the 1970s might assume this is how women looked back then, but they really did not. This is television.

The setting is Pasadena, and the home is lush and well furnished, but these people drive Pintos and Mavericks. (supplied by the Ford Motor Company). You will see the properly attired attorney Doug (James Broderick), his blonde, pretty, divorced daughter Nancy (Meredith Baxter Birney), creatively inclined high school dropout Willie (Gary Frank) and little boyish Buddy (Krisy McNichol). McNichol has perhaps the most endearing performance as kind hearted but self-loathing rebel who is trying to navigate the tumult of her early teen years. Guest stars like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt play friends of Buddy's.

The most artificial part of the show is the way life shattering problems (alcoholism, divorce, cancer, murder, custody battles) are solved in less than 60 minutes. There is always a tearful dramatic moment, where people cry, hug, apologize and then...it's morning in America again. But the viewer is lulled into a belief in both the power of the words and the strength of the performances.

""Family"" has some of the a folksy, granola naturalness that characterized the 1970s, a time when the war, drugs and protest cooled down, and the self-absorbed 1980s loomed ahead. Like ""The Waltons"", the Lawrence family showed that any trial or tribulation could be overcome with the right amount of family unity, love and courage.  Maybe that is the best thing to come out of this very well done drama.",1229385600,5,2164,4.861413043478261

Sada Thompson was everything I could have wanted for a family anchor and her family management felt like home and hearth.  Even to the house itself, the interior furnishings, family dinners at the table, family harmonics and arguments -- it was all extremely well-written and every dynamic was one that might come back in later episodes.  I loved every single episode for the role model it was and remains.  Old fashioned it may now appear, but it continues as something to aspire to even in these more ""modern"" times where family seems more of an afterthought rather than the main event.  Buy this and you won't be disappointed - I promise.  Boomers especially will appreciate this and those who miss out or just miss the family unit, will come back to this over and over.

2608022,5,B000GFRI68,"""Family"" is a fantastic, well-created show that deserves praise for many reasons.  Chief among these is its realism, believable family situations and the show's consistent ability to move the viewer, sometimes to tears.  The Lawrence family's dynamics are ones to which many of us can relate.  The production qualities and music, for the most part, are certainly on par with any made-for-TV movie of the late 70s and since.  And no foolish laugh tracks to distract the intelligent viewer.  Moreover, Mike Nichols and the show's producers and writers tackled with class and rationality some heavy issues, most of which are still difficult on a societal level (emphasize 'American' society).  This series represents among the finest dramas--this viewer believes--ever to have appeared.  I remember vaguely watching the show as a child, not having seen it since probably 9 years old, when it ceased production.  It obviously made an impression on me because something led me to purchase the set.  As I near completion of watching all the episodes, I now completely understand that connection early on, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it all over again.

When the series first aired we had small children at home, and now that our children are adults, we are able to view the series from a different perspective. If anything, we love them even more.

2608039,5,B000GFRI68,"I was utterly delighted that this landmark series was finally made available. Although tame viewing by today's standards, many sensitive and controversial issues were covered with (albeit conservative) empathy that had never been addressed before. Insightful, thoughtful and frequently witty writing. Although neither Elayne Heilveil nor Quinn Cummings ever held any appeal for me and I knew instinctively that the arrival of the latter was sounding the death knell for the series, it was an otherwise timeless cast, with interesting guest appearances.

Nonetheless, I have to be honest and admit that - a huge childhood crush on Gary Frank notwithstanding - the heart of Family for me has always been  the lovely, gracious, inimitable Sada Thompson. She never strikes a false note, speaks volumes with her eyes or with the hint of an expression. No emoting here, but the sensitivity, committment and hard work of an intelligent, well-honed and superior talent. I could watch her interactions with either James Broderick or Gary Frank ad infinitum. Ditto Kate reading her grocery list on the phone.

Despite occasional weaknesses due to deterioration of the colour, the overall picture quality is very good. However, I would have appreciated the convenience of having each episode broken into 'chapters'. Also, although my pleasure at having the series available meant I was initially unconcerned about the lack of special features, I would dearly love to see some included should there be another release.

And having watched every episode of Seasons One & Two at least 3 times, I will be heartbroken if there is not more.

The thing about Family is that it didn't have the togetherness that Eight is Enough had and the parents didn't seem affectionate. It was a certain disconnect, but I think that worked for the show. The acting was excellent as was the writing. Can anyone answer these questions?

1. Why did Elayne Heilveil leave the role as Nancy? She was good!

2. Why did Meredith Baxter Birney only appear in every other episode?

3. How did the show end?

and a rhetorical? Why did they get rid of the excellent original theme with that crappy theme from season 2?

Ah... This show makes me long for the warmth and security of the Carter years.",1180569600,3,775,4.460992907801418
2608043,5,B000GFRI68,"I've looked for this show for years and I'm so glad I finally found it.  It aired briefly in the late 80's or early 90's on an early cable network, then it disappeared.

I actually bought the DVD to hear the theme song. I couldn't quite remember the tune. The theme song to NPR's Weekend Edition is close in style but the melody (written by the actor I had a crush on, John Rubenstein - Jeff)eluded me through the years.  Imagine my disappointment when I heard the theme in the pilot episode and it wasn't the song I had expected.  That melody was wistfully beautiful with a little jazz thrown in.  I slightly remember that theme (also written by Rubenstein), but it wasn't the catchy tune I remembered. I suppose when the network decided to pick up the show they decided to give it a more upbeat theme song. I finally heard what I remembered in episode 5 or 6.

In viewing the shows with thirty years of perspective, I find all of them charming.  I believe Family was one of the first serialized dramas on tv where you got to really know the characters. The actors were superb. The writers touched issues that had previously been taboo on tv: an impaired (drug addicted) physician, an unwed mother,sexuality (Willie wasn't a misnomer!).  Kate even offered her pregnant daughter a cocktail in the pilot show.  Obviously, these shows were written before Fetal Alcoholism and Aids were a part of our medical conscience, but the shows are great.

The fashions are somewhat outdated, the messages in the stories are timeless. Share the DVD with your kids or grandkids and enjoy the discussion. (I did.)

I'm hoping the final seasons will become available too.",1174694400,9,1655,4.652920962199313

2608045,3,B000GFRI68,"This FAMILY first and second season DVD really brought back some great memories.  Not only was I the very same age as Buddy (Kristy McNichol) was when this show first began, but I grew up watching it for as long as this aired on Television.  I actually had never seen the original pilot show, so seeing it for the first time, and the shows that followed, was incredible.  I first noticed that this DVD was reproducted and rentable through blockbuster.com, but then I decided to just go ahead and buy it since it was offered through amazon.com for the least amount possible that I could search on the web, and I really didn't want to wait for the rental.  Amazon even beat out walmart and blockbuster prices by nearly 10 bucks. This DVD plays very well, very clear, without commercials; though I must say, the commercials from the 70's would be nice to see again too!  I'm just hoping that this collection will continue through all the seasons that it aired because I plan to buy them all!  Thank you amazon.com for allowing me to relive my childhood through the magic of Television once again.  GOOD JOB!! A+A+A+ service.  Will buy from again.",1174521600,16,1143,4.596059113300493

It's terrific to have a such a well written family series preserved on DVD especially in light of some of the questionable television that is on these days.  I just loved everything about it -the writing, the acting, it was an intelligent and thoughtful look at the things these people were experiencing in their lives.  For some reason it really struck a chord with me and became an all time favorite.  So you can imagine how excited I was to see it was finally released.  I'm just hoping the rest of the series will eventually come out as well.  I'd recommend it to anyone especially if you like good television with meaningful subject matter.  All the members of the Lawrence family were represented with storylines which also made it interesting and for me at that time Kristy McNichol's adolescent experiences were the most poignant.",1171670400,12,992,4.596590909090909

2608049,5,B000GFRI68,"Family was probably the best acted and written drama series to come out of America in the 1970s. Thankfully, those of us who grew up with the Lawrences can now retrace all the issues and challenges that they faced due to the DVD release of seasons one (only six episodes) and two. Hopefully seasons three and four are on the way.

Watching the series again all these years later has reminded me that Family is actually a show that, believe it or not, expresses family values. The Lawrences are a very warm, and loving family, and that's the theme that has proven to be universal, and timeless. At the time of its original broadcast dates, some of the themes seemed rather shocking, or at least confrontational. These days, no one is shocked to see these types of issues (divorced daughter who happens to be sexually active, the scar of adultery, a high school dropout son.....) portrayed. Television has covered all of these things, and more. We've moved on. However, what is memorable is the affection that the family demonstrate to each other, especially the little quiet moments between Sada Thompson and Kristy McNichol. It's a timely reminder that middle class people, with so-called liberal values also value their family relationships.",1170720000,10,1242,4.914285714285715
2608050,5,B000GFRI68,"I was so pleased to find this show on DVD, since I remembered watching it as a young adult.  I had forgotten so much of it.  Mostly I remembered Buddy.

It is an interesting time capsule.  Kate wears dresses around the house.  Kate and Doug share libations together on a regular basis - it is all very civilized.  Although Doug is an attorney, they seem unduly worried about their finances.  Willie's hair is pretty goofy looking - I am appalled that I used to have a little crush on him.  In spite of these quibbles, I love the show and am hooked all over again.

Buddy is entrancing, one of the best characters in the history of TV.  Buddy and Nancy are both timeless characters.  The poster who called Kate ""aristocratic"" is right on the money - she acts a little superior to everyone else, IMO.  Occasionally Buddy gets her to loosen up a little.  The writing is good, the acting is elegant, and I get choked up at least once every episode.

I am intrigued by the fact that Amazon features Mary Grace Canfield as the star.  She plays the maid and is quirky enough but hardly a star-making performance.  Great fun to see Genie Francis, Willie Aames, Tommy Lee Jones, et al in early performances.  I recommend this series highly.",1170374400,12,1231,4.472972972972973

I was in high school at the time and just beginning to appreciate a well-constructed, thought-provoking script.  Certainly, the show is dated but not to the point where it's unwatchable.  It's amusing how some heavy issues are approached so gingerly.  Then we were shocked - now we smile and think ""God, they were cautious back in the 70's.""  But for me, experiencing the Lawrences again was like a family reunion - pardon the pun.  I loved these characters and their interactions together.  This show was very sophisticated for it's time - and in today's era of Survivor, Super Nanny and Nancy Grace, I long for television written BY clever people FOR clever people.  Okay, so I'm being overly cynical.  Yes, there are some well-written shows today mixed in with the shlock - if you watch long enough you'll find them!  But I digress... Sada Thompson's stoic Kate is a wonderful matriarch.  And don't forget inquisitive Buddy, brooding Willy, perfect father/husband/champion Doug and, of course, bumbling big sister Nancy!  FAMILY is a great nostalgia trip with relatives you forgot how much you missed.",1168214400,16,1176,4.883838383838384

Back then, I probably watched for Kristy McNichol, which wasn't a bad reason because she was terrific. But as an adult, I see the heart of the show was the tender, subtle performance of Sada Thompson. The entire cast is wonderful, and works because you truly believe they are a family. If you're a fan of true, heart felt dramas like Everwood and Party of Five, check our Family. It deserves to be remembered and treasured.",1168041600,6,505,4.440860215053763

This show is from the 70's and was considered very daring in its time.  One would think the subject matter would seem dated today but due to the excellent writing, and heartwarming, emmy-worthy acting all around, every episode is just as relevant today.

It is so refreshing to see a show done for quality and not to just be the best cop show or beat others in the ratings.  To bring Meredith Baxter into season 2 as Nancy was the smartest choice. (Season 1 was actually an extended mini series.) She gave Nancy such depth and brought her to life.  Her scenes with the truly gifted Sada Thompson are pure acting revelations.  They are both two of the best dramatic actresses ever.

And add in Kristy mcNichol, who had rare maturity for someone her age and also an acting range that puts todays people to shame.

It is too bad that a show makes you long for when tv was done merely to provide quality, which this show does in spades.  All I can say is PLEASE, I BEG, put all the other seasons on dvd as well.

I love this show, and my heart sank when I read another reviewer's post that his DVD's were suffering from DVD Rot. I checked mine and, lo and behold, they are degrading as well!!! Luckily, unlike with some other people who are experiencing this, mine still work, so I am making a backup copy of my set and I urge you to check yours and back them up too before you lose them.  The DVD's seem to not be available anymore and this may be the reason, so before you lose this gorgeous show, back it up!!  To report your DVD rot issues to SONY, you can do so here: consumer@SPHECustomerSupport.sony.com

What follows is my original review.  It is five star because I am reviewing the show, not SONY:

Family holds as true and charming as it always has, and one cannot help but truly feel as one of the family while watching it.  When the DVD season's 1 & 2 came to an end, I really missed the Lawrence's!  I love watching some TV on DVD, but this one I truly hated to see end as I approached the last DVD on the set.

I have always loved this show and I must confess was a bit in shock when I found out it was to be released on DVD.  I never thought I'd see the day, but always hoped.  I mean, they released `Punky Brewster' for crying out loud, why not Family?!  I was also a bit worried that, at the last moment, the DVD release might be canceled or delayed (can we say `Once and Again'?)  But, lo and behold, it WAS released on schedule and., I might add, wonderfully remastered!

While a few episodes show their age on some short scenes, the overall quality of these DVD's episode mastering is gorgeous.  I had the episodes on tape, which I recorded while on syndication, all horribly chopped up.  Now, watching these episodes in their glorious entirety, beautiful colour and sound...what else could I add except: PLEASE release seasons 3, 4 and 5!

NEWS:  No news.  Does that say it all?  SONY has not yet announced another season release.  Yes, they are usualy slow (check their track record), and maybe I have been burnt by corporations like Buena Vista, who left thousands hanging for 'Once and Again' season three (we are still hangning, by the way, years later).  Maybe we can start a petition on [...]?  Notice that SONY Home Entertainment does not even care to hear from you.  There is no contact info on their site.  Maybe that says it all as well?",1162512000,9,2494,4.348484848484849

This DVD set brings back those times fresh and new.. If you are at least my age then you will know things that you had to be there to know and if you forgot then watching this will bring it back, like the episode Buddy talks on a CB radio, the catch phrases ""Far -Out"" Dynamite, etc...  are spoken of frequently.  Current and popular Tv peseronalities of that day being mentioned on some of the episodes are Donnie & Marie.. John Boy.. I enjoyed how current this show was at mentioning what was HOT and ""IN"".  where's Pong?  Technology has changed in the last 30 years, but not really people.

2608074,5,B000GFRI68,"FAMILY, was one of the best (if not the best) dramatic series on Television during its triumphant run in the 1970's. The show dealt with many serious issues that the Lawrence family from Pasadena, California dealt with magnificently well. Although the series initially was supposed to have a short lifespan as a midseason replacement for another show,it quickly found an audience and became incredibly popular that the producers made it a permanent weekly attraction. The show enjoyed an unparalled success mainly to the superb performances from its gifted cast. When Family first premiered on March 9, 1976, I was 10 years old and I quickly became infatuated (like most boys my age) with the innocence, charm and sweetness of Kristy McNichol. I became a huge fan of this gifted and talented actress that I would watch the show every week just because she was in it. I decorated my bedrooms walls with every poster and magazine article that I could find about her from the popular teen magazines of the day like Teen Beat, 16 and Tigerbeat. Kristy, (Buddy Lawrence on the show) stole my heart and during my formative teen years she was an idol of mine. I'm very happy that they finally put this amazing and groundbreaking series out on DVD, it was about time and I know that there are many people out there who grew up in the 70's like I did that feel the same way. Now that the first and second seasons have been finally released (in this beautiful box set which contains the first 28 episodes from seasons I & II, I hope that they will release the remaining episodes of seasons III and IV on DVD as well. I don't remember how many seasons that show was on but it had a remarkable run from 1976-1980. The picture and sound quality of the show is outstanding and I'm glad that I'm able to go back and relive a period in my life when everything was more simple and less complicated. To who ever thought of the genius idea to release this legendary dramatic series on video I thank you and all of us who loved this beautiful show thank you. Now I can watch Family anytime that I want and I can show my kids what a great show this was and I can smile and think back to when I had a huge crush on Kristy McNichol, one of the hottest and most talented teen idols of her day.",1159660800,11,2269,4.430622009569378
2608075,5,B000GFRI68,"Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldburg did a series without car chases, shoot 'em up or cute expressions. Family was a slice of Americana with a large piece  of life, real life. The characters spoke honest feeling, sometimes not always pretty. Storylines and characters reappear in an episode or three..it was the PBS show An American Family done for Prime time TV

This 1970's show was never sitcom-ish. The cast was first rate lead by Sada Thompson and James (Matthew's dad) Broderick as the mother and Father  of three children. Nancy (first season-Elayne Heilveil, Second season Meredith Baxter Birney) is  a divorcing mother with a young son. Wiulle (Gary Frank) is a young man trying to find his path in life. Buddy (Kritie McNicholl) is learn what it means to be a teen and a young adult.

This show handled adult situation with real emotion. Such subject as being gay (a tattoo in late 1970s), Drug abuse, Death of an older loved one, Breast cancer and its effects on the family, divorce, alcoholism and many issues plaguing families today, The show may seem slightly dated, but on the whole it stamds up as go as when it aired

I too, had a special relationship with my older brother, who was very similar to Gary Frank's, Willy. As an adult, I appreciate the superb acting of this Award winning series. Everyone is perfectly cast, and the acting is ""spot on"" as one reviewer wrote. I can appreciate the the excellent writing also. I have only seen the first 5 episodes so far, but each has pushed me to tears. I only hope and pray that all remaining seasons will be released.",1158451200,8,555,4.398058252427185
2608078,5,B000GFRI68,This is compelling viewing of a special sort.  The quality of the writing and performances is astonishing.,1158364800,5,106,5.235294117647059
2608079,5,B000GFRI68,"Who would have thought that this quality show would ever be released on DVD? Thankfully someone realized that there's still an audience craving intelligent, heartfelt, humanistic drama!

What strikes me upon watching these episodes again after so many years is the superb writing & acting. These are smart, articulate people, living in a more civilized culture than exists in America today. They're also flawed in very human ways, capable of deeply wounding & being wounded, but always ready to take the path of reconciliation & understanding. It's a family that expects more from itself than the lowest common denominator ... and the show is wise enough to acknowledge that such a laudable & worthwhile goal may sometimes have its drawbacks.

Kate was warm but a touch aristocratic, obviously the driving force in the family dynamic. She could be infuriating at times, heartbreaking at others, both in her relationship with Doug & with her children. Nancy could be spoiled, Doug stubborn, Willie a little too carefree in his approach to life, Buddy simply struggling to grow up -- but all were basically admirable, striving to grow & embrace life, rather than hide from it. They took chances, for all the comforts of their cozy home; they were hurt at times, made foolish choices, found unexpected rewards. Not an idealized family, but a very desirable one!

This was very much a writer's show -- the dialogue is sharp, witty, poignant, laced with warmth & humor when needed, often summing up a complex situation with a pithy phrase. Some younger viewers might complain that people don't really talk like that. Perhaps they don't, at least not these days. But again, the writing aspired to more than the barely sufficient. It makes you appreciate language & how it can be used.

But the writing is only half of it -- without fine acting, the best writing in the world falls flat. Luckily the show was blessed with subtle, quietly powerful actors, who could express a wealth of emotion in the inflection of a single word, or a brief glance. Despite the time-specific backdrop & references, this is truly a timeless family, experiencing & responding to all the trials & joys that life brings.

So here's hoping the subsequent seasons are released as well! We need more quality viewing, just to remind people that there's more to life than ""reality"" shows, spoiled celebrities, and the crass & the vapid (which ought to be the title of half the shows currently on TV). Most highly recommended!",1158019200,183,2491,4.921428571428572
2608080,5,B000GFRI68,"I just finished watching the Pilot episode of ""Family"" via this nice-looking 6-Disc DVD set containing Seasons 1 and 2 of the series. I've seen many of these episodes previously, but I don't recall ever having seen the Pilot program, which co-stars Elayne Heilveil in the part of ""Nancy"" (she was later replaced by Meredith Baxter-Birney). You may recall Heilveil co-starring opposite David Janssen in a pretty good 1973 TV-Movie called ""Birds Of Prey"" (which is also available on DVD).

The Pilot episode for ""Family"" is simply wonderful, perfectly introducing us to the Lawrence ""family"". I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this Pilot. Everybody in the cast, from Sada Thompson right on down the line, is just perfect. I'd recommend this Pilot (and this DVD set) to anyone who enjoys family-type dramas. The Pilot episode was filmed in late 1975, and was originally telecast on March 9th, 1976.

There are a few very funny moments in the Pilot show too, especially when an angry Doug (James Broderick) screams at Willie (Gary Frank) after the family learns that 13-year-old Buddy (Kristy McNichol) has taken the car out for a spin -- ""Willie, you stay here and try to figure out how you can possibly have an I.Q. of 140 and not use ANY of it!!"" ~LOL~ (You see, Willie has secretly been giving Buddy driving lessons. And the fact that Willie has recently dropped out of school doesn't exactly help to make dad any happier with young William either.)

The ""Family"" Pilot features the burgeoning acting talent of an extremely young-looking (and future Emmy-winning) Miss McNichol, who gives a spot-on performance in the series' premiere as ""Buddy"", a girl who has her own set of problems to deal with -- e.g., she's being called ""Shrimp-o"" at school; she's upset at being the shortest (and flattest) girl in her class; she gets quite an earful while eavesdropping on her parents' argument; and she ends up in a police car before this Pilot reaches its conclusion (that ""driving without a license"" thing, remember).

It was quite a debut show for Kristy indeed. And she pulls it off like a veteran. A remarkable actress. (But she had already co-starred in one TV series prior to ""Family"" -- a short-lived drama called ""Apple's Way"", which lasted for 28 episodes in 1974 and '75.)

This DVD collection of six single-sided discs gathers together the short 6-episode first season of ""Family"" and the entire 22-program second season, for a total of 28 hour-long shows (the episodes run for about 49 to 50 minutes on the DVDs).

The video and audio look and sound mighty good here too. Colors aren't super-saturated, but I'll bet the PQ here is every bit as good as when these shows first aired on ABC-TV in 1976 and 1977.

""Family"" appeared on network television for five seasons (86 total episodes), from 1976 to June of 1980. Aaron Spelling and Mike Nichols were two of the creative forces who brought this intelligently-written and well-acted drama into American homes for those five TV seasons.

Upon digging a little into the background of this series, I was surprised to learn that some of the original music for ""Family"" was credited to Pete Rugolo and John Rubinstein. (Rubinstein, who composed the low-key musical themes for the Pilot broadcast, played Nancy's husband ""Jeff Maitland"" in various episodes throughout the series; while Rugolo's signature trademark, as far as I'm concerned, will forever be his one-of-a-kind music that he created for the 1960s TV series ""The Fugitive"".)

I also have learned that at least one episode of ""Family"" was directed by actress Joanne Woodward. I hadn't realized that tidbit of information either, prior to preparing this review. So, the ""Family"" talent runs deep, both in front of the camera and behind it.

""Family"" gets its very first home-video release of any kind with the September 5, 2006, arrival of this DVD set from SPHE (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment). There aren't any bonus features within this set, but the quality of the episodes themselves makes this collection more than worthwhile.

Video is presented in its proper TV ratio (1.33:1 Full-Frame). The audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. There are no subtitles, but English Closed-Captioning can be accessed if you've got a caption-capable television.

Packaging for this 6-DVD set comes in the form of three slim cases which slide into an outer cardboard carton (each of the plastic cases holds two DVDs).

I look forward to additional ""Family"" seasons reaching the DVD market in the future (knock wood). I'm sure that other fans of the show are hoping that the remaining seasons are released on DVD too. Because once you've taken a look at this series' dandy premiere episode, you're bound to want to see more of a ""Family"" named Lawrence.",1157846400,49,4755,4.913965087281795
2608081,5,B000GFRI68,This show was by far my favorite growing up (I had a crush on Kristy Mcnichol) but it also helped to divert from me from my own family's disintegration as a young pre teen. They seemed so normal and capable of dealing with difficult issues which maintaining the family unity...something missin today. This was a show ahead of it's time.  Now I cannot wait until the remainder of the seasons to be released (there were more than 2 weren't there?) Any idea when the other seasons will be available?

2608085,5,B000GFRI68,"This program affects my brain waves and neuron connections. It is healing in many ways.  First, Kristy McNichol is the most adorable woman I've ever seen on television, extremely talented and it was all her natural acting ability.

This thoughtful program was considered ground breaking for its time as a form of reality television, dealing with real life sensitive issues previous television tried to cover-up. In fact, this was Aaron Spelling's favorite production of the hundreds of series he created in his lifetime. This program was Aaron Spelling's pride and joy and justifiably so. It had some real depth, was full of true caring, love and emotions, less contrived then other programs of its day.

Matthew Broderick's (Ferris Beuller's Day Off) father played as the father. Sada Thompson and the rest of the cast are excellent. Kristy McNichol was the biggest star of the program and went on after receiving two Emmys to establish new heights for teen actress movie contracts. Kristy McNichol was the first to get a movie contract for what was back then a dizzying $1,000,000 (1980).

This program may seem too boring for today's audience, but those of us who grew up back then really appreciate the value it gave to help us through hard times with our dysfunctional, careless, abusive parents.",1156636800,15,1301,5.0092592592592595

2608087,5,B000GFRI68,"I got hooked on ""Family"" in the mid-eighties, when Lifetime TV started and the network would show re-runs of ""Family"" in the afternoon.  After that it seemed to pretty much vanish from the airwaves.  Finding out that the show is coming out on DVD, through a fluke while surfing the net, has made my morning.  I have read of the series, ""Usually well-written, and always well-acted,"" and that pretty much captures the quality of the show.  I'm eager to see if time has been kind to the series plot-wise, but actually would watch no matter what.  It has been written that the Fisher family of Los Angeles on ""Six Feet Under"" were modeled after the Lawrences of Pasadena. ""Family"" was aired at a time when the nation was experiencing a hangover from the sixties, Watergate, and Vietnam, so in one episode you see Kristy McNichol's character (Who played perhaps the only child on TV ever to have three nicknames.  Nobody ever called her by her real name, Letitia; her brother called her ""Peaches"" and her mother called her ""Tizzylish"" and to everyone else she was ""Buddy"") dancing disco while in another her mother Kate frets about returning to college as an older woman.  What a great show!  Superb cast including James Broderick (late father of Matthew Broderick), Sada Thompson, Meredith Baxter, Gary Frank, and of course McNichol, with various notables in guest roles.  The show is also a fine portrait of an UMC Los Angeles family in the seventies.",1156032000,17,1449,4.78714859437751

I used to watch Family since it first premiered in 1976 until the series ended.  The writers were great giving these actors wonderful scripts...enjoyed two episodes where Kate's mother comes for one last visit and the episode where Willie's friend comes out of the closet being gay..

2608089,5,B000GFRI68,"With so much crap out there, getting a quick DVD release, it's amazing a quality series such as Family hasn't been out sooner.  I watched this duriing its first run & it was one of the few shows that I was allowed to see at such a late hour (10 PM).  It shifted throughout its run to earlier formats, but due to some of its controversial themes, the series was initially put in a later time slot than the typical family viewing hour.

There's so much to love about Family.  Sada Thompson was always elegant & graceful as Kate, the matriarch.  James Broderick was so down-to-earth & good natured, he was warming as the Lawrence patriarch.  Kristy McNichol was lovable as Buddy & made you wish you had a friend like her in real-life.  Gary Frank as Willie was carefree & made you wish you had Willie as a brother or even as a boyfriend.  He had all of the fine qualities a grounded woman seeks in a man.  Was really cute as well.

I implore anyone who has never seen this show to buy this set, as well as longtime fans, such as myself who watched it as a child.

Family was critically acclaimed as a result of its frank depiction of love & relationships.  It also garnered an emmy for Kristy & Sada, due to their poignant performances.

I'll buy every season as its released & have many Family marathons to relive the good ol' days of this fine & stellar tv series.  Can't wait to get my copy.",1154304000,122,1391,4.2796934865900385

My best friend, Lisa May from KROQ Radio in Los ANgeles (The Kevin & Bean Show)and I use to run home everyday during the mid 80's to watch this--our favorite-show! It was re-run paradise !  Sada Thompson was awesome as the matriarch--before Agnes Carpenter, (The Carpenters) the over-manipulating-yet quite entertaining mother of famous singing-siblings Richard & Karen Carpenter) Sada ruled the roost with an iron fist and a oven mitt. Totally domineering, yet lovable in a totally non-approachable way--which helped the audience understand why her perfect looking family was so disfunctional. Please--if I had Merideth Baxter Birney living in my (converted) garage, I'd be pestering her with all kinds of questions about Betty Broderick!!  Kristy McNichol was stunning in her portrail of Buddy--the misunderstood teenage girl who's every waking breath was a conflict with EVERYTHING !

And who didn't just love Willy?  Before dissheveled hair was considered cool, he was just a tired looking boy-mess filed with angst and smart allec one liners--which we all loved.
