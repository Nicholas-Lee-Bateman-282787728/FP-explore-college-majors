Also found as a bonus are interviews and behind the scenes.

White the picture and sound quality are great to me, the light show could be a problem to some.  They have about 30 spotlights that crisscross during the show and at times they can be distracting and/or overwhelming.  I personally didn't have much of a problem but I can see where others might.  At one point in the show the spotlights are white and red and crisscross so brightly that you can barely see the band.  It doesn't last long but it's still distracting to watch on a TV. (I bet it was awesome in person though!)

One of the things pointed out from that stage that I found pretty cool is the fact that the audience represented over 40 countries.  For those not familiar with the band this stands as proof of the popularity and talent of the band.  While Epica isn't large in the United States, they're a force to be reckoned with overseas with their style of Symphonic Metal.

I found the track listing to be great although I personally would have liked to see more off of their Consign to Oblivion album.  More specifically, I would have loved to see them perform ""Mother of Light"" and/or ""Dance of Fate"" but that's just my humble opinion.

In summary, if you've not heard of them, pick this up as a great way to see what the band is all about.  If you're already a fan you'll love this concert as a part of your collection.  For me: 4.5 stars, losing only a 1/2 star for not including the 2 songs I mentioned above (those are my personal favorites).",1415059200,4,2196,4.544529262086514

Who cares about machine head they are aweful.  I was really looking forward to seeing EPICA live.. EPICA PLEASE COME BACK!!!",1413158400,2,277,4.54

8636990,5,B00HWWK6FS,"Somehow neglected to ever see Epica play live in person until earlier this year in NYC, no clue what the hell I was doing before that was so much more important, but that same night I immediately bought a copy of every record they had for sale at the merch booth, and the rest on Amazon plus this when I got home. With the retirement of barnum & bailey this is now a good contender for the greatest show on earth. Only downside is it does need less spotlights and more lasers, but we're all really here for the music anyway, the video stream is more or less wall art",1512777600,,566,4.154545454545454

8636992,5,B00HWWK6FS,"This live performance was put together with great love,care and hard work.  It is not possible to tour with an entire orchestra and choir.  However, for a band as talented and ambitious as Epica -- perhaps it could be done for one night.  Retrospect does just that.  What a great band with a great performance!  I was unaware of Epica, or of symphonic metal until just a few short months ago (about March of 2017) even though I had been a fan of Little Rock's Evanescence since the soundtrack to Daredevil and then, of course, Fallen.  I had been in love with gothic/symphonic metal and am so glad to know that Epica, Delain, Nightwish, Within Temptation and others exist, but more than that, make great music.  Is it almost impossible to hear mostly northern-european symphonic metal here in the US through ""normal/traditional"" channels here in the US?  It appears so as I did not hear their music on any radio station, including Sirius satellite radio, but only through reading and research.  I owe the discovery of Babymetal to Rolling Stone, and Epica to Loudwire.  Then a quick jump to ""youtube"" to hear the vast amount of videos of the amazingly deep catalogue that Epica possesses.  And fortunately, Pandora will play all of the afore-mentioned bands and more on a programmable ""Epica"" station.  Within the first month of my late discovery, I have purchased 4 of their albums and this Blu-ray.  I'm sprinting to catch up with so much material!  I have yet to hear an Epica song that wasn't great.  They are so talented and terrific.  I realized in Dallas, I'm as guilty as anyone else of not knowing previously of this awesome band.  I had no idea they made such great metal in Holland.  I look a little further and I see that Nightwish had headlined to a huge audience during prime time at Waken Open Air way back in 2013.  Well, I'm driving all of my friends and Dallas fans of metal (we are, after all, the home of everyone's favorite Cowboys from Hell, Pantera) crazy recommending Epica - who I'm pleased to say will be coming to Dallas with Lacuna Coil in September 2017  -- a must show that cannot be missed!
Which brings me to the Retrospect Blu-ray.  It's simply awesome from beginning to end.  I see that it was released back in 2013, so it's from 4 years ago and they've released 2 albums since then.  Retrospect contains 26 beautifully shot and recorded songs.  On my big-screen televisions, it's a visual and sonic masterpiece.  I did read one criticism of the bright lights to wash out the picture.  Yes, it's true  -- and a director's choice.  It is cut in such a way that we are made aware that the live performance uses lots of bright light, but those shots are then quickly cut to others, and the point is made.  Epica's show is a big show and uses big lights!  I have fallen in love with symphonic metal.  I love Epica and Retrospect.  I highly recommend this Blu-ray.",1498348800,2,2893,4.5680933852140075
8636993,5,B00HWWK6FS,"Let me start off by saying that I've been a long time fan of the symphonic/melodic metal genre, specifically with bands such as Nightwish, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, and others.  Epica has been a band that I've liked, but somewhat neglected due to the fact that I'm not really into the growling vocals - Simone's voice is just too beautiful to (in my opinion) be paired with growls, but that's just me.  So, basically, I like Epica, but they're not among my top favorites.

The reason I'm explaining this is so that others can understand that the opinions of this review are coming from someone who really wasn't all that into Epica...and I need only point to the title of this review for you to see what I think of them now...  This performance is, without a doubt, the greatest, most impressive visual and audible performance I've ever seen!!

THE SOUND
Holy cow, the sound...  A 70-piece orchestra, choir, the band...  Whoever mixed this show deserves a medal and lifetime expenses paid early retirement.  Incredible.  Flawless.  I can't explain how amazing this sounds.  Although I have also enjoyed this show on my computer with a plain-jane sound card and speakers, please enjoy a proper EXPERIENCE of this show on a decent home theater system.  It deserves at least that.  Either way, you will not be disappointed.

THE LIGHTS
I see people complaining about the lights but it's not a problem at all to me.  Yes, perhaps they could have used some diffusion, and the camera-ops could stand to close the iris a bit at times, but ultimately it didn't distract or ruin any part of the show for me.  If you're watching it in a dark room, and/or generally are sensitive to lots of bright/flashing lights then yeah, I could see where some of the visuals here might not be totally enjoyable for you.  Sensitivities aside, the lights didn't bother me.

PERFORMANCE
Well, I'll say only this - if you glance around at people in the audience from time to time, you'll catch people crying.  There is a ton of emotion and feeling and energy in this show, and I was feeling just as much of it as some of those crying audience members were.
Guitars are thumping and precise, drums are intense, orchestra/choir is powerful and dramatic, Simone's voice is crisp and projecting and wonderful for being a few months pregnant and singing for 3 hours.  Floor Jansen from Nightwish makes a guest appearance for two songs to duet beautifully with Simone.

OVERALL
Are there other live performances out there that outdo this one in terms of the music? the light shows? the editing? the general band energy and performance?  Yeah, absolutely.  Epica can't compete with the likes of Iron Maiden in terms of stage presence, or Nightwish in terms of pyrotechnics and lights, but that's not how I'm judging this performance.  How I'm judging this performance, is by the ""stuck in my head"" factor (i.e. after watching this show, I can't stop thinking about it!).  I can't stop looking the songs up on youtube to listen and watch it all over again during random moments of the day, and no other band's show has had that effect on me before.  I think that says a heck of a lot for a band like Epica that I only somewhat liked before...

Make of this what you will.  Coming from someone who wasn't all that into Epica, I can't say enough about how great this show is and I will cherish it for years to come, forever wishing I could have been there LIVE to be a part of something so amazing.  Simone says it best at the end of the show, ""You will never forget this,"" indeed, I certainly won't.",1466380800,2,3562,4.609523809523809

8636995,3,B00HWWK6FS,"Good performance, and great vocals from Simone. The two guys who growl and snarl need to take a seat and let her sing more. I could have given this a 5 star rating if it weren't for the two guys trying to say who knows what. Also disappointing as it is not playable on most US DVD players.",1439337600,,289,4.0
8636996,1,B00HWWK6FS,"Very disappointed despite the intricate production. Simone's vocals were flawless of course, as is her beauty despite being obviously into her second trimester, a beautiful young mother to be indeed! The choir and the orchestra were a very nice touch. The lighting and pyro-tecnics were enjoyable as well despite having to be somewhat limited for safety of course. My only complaint with the show, or Epica's music in general is the ridiculous death metal backing vocals which obviously did not fit with the intricacy and beauty of Epica's music and stage image. It's almost like watching two different shows at the same time - not only very disorienting, but very disappointing as well. No wonder the band's music lies undiscovered to America. A shame really since Epica is a very talented band otherwise, they're writing style just need to mature. If one was to turn the sound down the show is enjoyable enough to watch, the band just sounds terrible because of their immature, idiotic style, unfortunately even the ballads are ruined by the same wasteful foolishness. Such a shame! No wonder they only have ONE DVD available for sale after all these years. And they wonder why they haven't caught on? Grow up kids - you don't lack talent, you just don't know how to utilize it. What a waste of time and skill!",1432944000,2,1312,4.835555555555556
8636997,5,B00HWWK6FS,"A lot of people complain about the light show, I didn't mind it. Personal preference, I suppose. If you're epileptic you might want to skip this one though, no joke. Great band, great set, guest appearances were awesome, energy was high, and special features were really cool. A+",1429142400,2,279,4.833333333333333

8636999,3,B00HWWK6FS,I like the music. I had to take it off ( I will just listen to it) as the light show was so distracting. A lot of spot lights that constantly crisscross even in front of the band that it takes away from being able to watch them.,1419552000,,228,3.7708333333333335
