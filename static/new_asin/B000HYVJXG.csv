8142596,1,B000HYVJXG,"Was looking for a decent print of Dinner At The Ritz, and was sorely disappointed when I ordered the DVD from Family Value; a double billing with No, No Nanette.  Don't waste your money.  A very sub-par quality of picture and sound on both films.  I was unable to even get through the first ten minutes on either film.",1472601600,,318,4.3559322033898304
8142597,5,B000HYVJXG,There are a few nights a month I just wand to watch the classics and this was a great addition to my collection. Musicals from back in the 'Hey' day are always a favorite. The black and white adds to the fun and the music is sweet.,1323561600,,231,3.9361702127659575
8142598,1,B000HYVJXG,"I agree with D.G.D....""No, No Nanette"" is an RKO bomb with a very good cast, but with a innate/simple screenplay, it has no vigor, no purpose and throw in no comedy ;albeit, a few good songs are totally wasted as no one has a good voice...just alot of foolish jibberish wondering when this turkey ends; conversely, the French beauty pays off big in, ""Dinner at the Ritz""...you can't take your eyes off...ANNABELLA...I say again...Richard Carlson, Victor Mature, Eve Arden and Roland Young are victimized by an innate screen/play and just seem to 'waltz threw the tulips' for a steady pay/check...too bad, not at all worth this price.",1177804800,4,633,4.925233644859813
8142599,5,B000HYVJXG,This is a classic movie double feature that can usually be found for only a buck at many of the dollar stores. Good entertainment!!,1170115200,3,131,4.5
8142600,1,B000HYVJXG,"I gave it one star. This really is a wretched movie. It's not funny, it's not a musical and it wastes a wonderful cast: Victor Mature, Zasu Pitts, Eve Arden. The stage show on which this movie was based ran for over 600 performances in the 20s and enjoyed a popular revival in the 70s. Judging from this movie, one can only imagine what they must have chucked out to adapt it to celluloid because if this was anything like the stage version it would have closed the first night.

The comedy is contrived when it happens and though people in comedies may be broadly realized, the writers in this took some convoluted and tedious routes to get to what they must have thought hysterical pay offs and punch lines. The actors only look stupid because even people in comedies are supposed to resemble real human beings and here they're just props for bad bad bad writing and direction.

This is a terrible waste of time. And people laugh at ""Cocaine Fiends"". It just goes to show: you can spend more money on a movie's production and still wind up with garbage.

Have tried to watch the 2nd feature: ""Dinner At The Ritz"" and it may be better.

The cover art is the best thing about this DVD.",1169337600,6,1185,4.422018348623853
