My kids love watching this video, and now I have to take them there so that they can experience it full force!!!! I promised.
Perfect way to educate natives and new comers of our culture. My daughter took it to school to show off where her grandma Shirls is from. Just Brilliant! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!",1285200000,,378,4.492753623188406
8403928,5,B003RYQXNE,"I just love, love, love this DVD. It is proof of what I have been telling my stateside friends about the Virgin Islands. It's a perfect gift for someone living abroad (to include VIslanders that have moved away) and with its impeccable quality, a great marketing tool for the Virgin Islands. But it is also a great keepsake to have at home.

It's a fun dvd to watch alone and with friends! Superb work by Mr. Wheatley.",1284768000,2,418,4.428571428571429
8403929,5,B003RYQXNE,"This is such an amazing documentary of the Virgin Islands Carnival.  Carnival is a great culture experience for people throughout the caribbean and this DVD portrays the greatest highlights and expresses carnival in its best form.  As many Virgin Islanders like myself are living away from home this is a true 'keeper' for the DVD Home Kit.  Its something you can watch when you are home sick and its a great opportunity to market and spread the love and colorful vibes of the VI community.

John Wheatley is a Great Virgin Islander and has done such a fantastic job of using his talents to uplift our community in a positive way by sharing this experience of our culture with the world.

This is a must have for all visitors to the VI and for each Virgin Islander.",1283904000,,765,4.554744525547445
8403930,5,B003RYQXNE,"I loved the video. I've always had fond memories of Carnival, but the My Virgin Islands DVD captured carnival better than I could have ever imagined. It really made me home sick and proud to be from St. Thomas. Living in NC now, there's so many people I want to show this to - you just can't capture the culture of the VI better than this!

On this DVD you get to hear the calypso and steel pan music plus all the aspects that make carnival special - Jouvert, Parades, Queen Show, Horse Race, Food and Cultural Fair, the Toddler's Derby and the dancing.  In addition, the commentary and interviews throughout the DVD walk you through the entire carnival experience.

It's truly a gem to anyone from the Caribbean that is living abroad, but I would also recommend this to anyone that's ever been intrigued by caribbean culture, or to anyone that's ever thought of visiting the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Carnival is a fun festivity that shows the true spirit of caribbean people.  This professional quality video captures all the excitement.",1282953600,2,1035,4.696132596685083
