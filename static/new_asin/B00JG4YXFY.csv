6356701,5,B00JG4YXFY,"This is a beautiful, soulful film, anchored by a beautiful, soulful performance by Oscar Isaac.  It manages to strike an improbably balance between the typically-skewed Coen brothers worldview and a grounded, sympathetic, humane portrayal of the title character.  A highlight in an impressive filmography.",1456272000,2,305,5.909090909090909
6356702,5,B00JG4YXFY,This is one of the best Criterion releases I've picked up since I started collecting. The interview between the Coen bros and Del Toro is particularly great. I can't recommend this enough.,1455580800,2,188,4.90625
6356703,5,B00JG4YXFY,"As usual, the CRITERION COLLECTION curates and releases the best version of this film (the first Coen Bros film in the collection).

The print quality is very very strong, the soundtrack is beautiful. The film is an acid-dark comedy - both an appreciation of and a critique of the efforts of authenticity in the early 60s Greenwich folk scene. Oscar Isaacs is fantastically dour, but also deeply talented.

This release also contains some exceptional extras, as some Criterion editions provide. This edition has several particularly compelling, special, distinct extras, which makes it among the best of even recent Criterion releases.

 Notable here:

~ The full aired broadcast version of ""Another Time, Another Place,"" a super-star folk concert featuring music and performers from the film.

~ An interview of the Coens by noted filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, a charming conversation that spans the aesthetic and technical inspirations of the career of the filmmakers. Very enjoyable for cinema buffs.

~ a metaphysical discussion about folk music between the Coens and T Bone Burnett, musical director of this film and long-time collaborator

~ a 40 minute documentary about the making of this film.

~ The commentary for this film features notable writers about folk musicians Robert Christgau, David Hajdu, and Sean Wilentz

~ historical background about the 60s Greenwich folk scene

~ A short documentary from 1961 about a violent folk musician / NYC police protest.",1453420800,36,1473,5.278969957081545

6356706,5,B00JG4YXFY,This movie hits me hard. The resolution of the Blu-ray is excellent and Criterion has so many great bonuses. Oscar Isaac gives his best performance to date and the Coen Bros have made another Odyssian classic.,1482624000,,209,4.833333333333333

6356712,5,B00JG4YXFY,"""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is, along with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" one of my two or three films by the Coen Brothers. It depicts the life of a folk singer in Greenwich Village during the early sixties, and is roughly based on the life of Dave Van Ronk. The film has been available on another DVD and Blu-ray, but has now been issued by The Criterion Collection, which, along with doing an excellent transfer, has added a good deal of material about the film and the Coen Brothers in general. I bought this newer issue for the extra materials, and have not been disappointed. It's highly recommended for fans of the Coen Brothers or the sixties folk scene.",1465948800,5,654,4.5508474576271185

6356715,2,B00JG4YXFY,"I'm a big fan of the Coen Brothers, but I did not like this movie. John Goodman gave a strong performance as usual. The song in front of the Chicago club owner was the highlight of the film; otherwise, I had no empathy for the lead character.
Probably my least favorite Criterion release and definitely the worst movie from the great Coen Brothers.",1461283200,2,348,4.5396825396825395
6356716,5,B00JG4YXFY,"I was not a big fan of the movie. I loved the soundtracks, the original and the Another Day, Another Time live set. This Criterion Collection version includes the documentary live concert and is 10 times better than the movie!",1460160000,,226,4.675

6356718,5,B00JG4YXFY,this was an amazing movie. I enjoyed the music to the movie so much I downloaded my favorites from the soundtrack. Fare the well and hang me have a tendency to get stuck in my head. This movie is not a comedy in the vein of other Cowen brother movies but it still has some of the quirks. Oscar Isaac gives a subtly heartbreaking turn as we follow the ups and downs of the titular character for a week. the movie is dark but a wondrous adventure that I was glad I finally sat down to watch it. I just wished I had found it sooner.,1459382400,,529,4.0
6356719,5,B00JG4YXFY,The Coen's may have made their masterpiece with Oscar Isaac playing the title character in this beautifully shot tale of a man who just can't get out of his own damn way. It's heartbreaking in places and hysterical in others and both at once as well. The ending should lead to one helluva conversation too. Must see as is the case with most Coen Brother entries.,1459382400,3,362,4.5
6356720,5,B00JG4YXFY,"I was never a big folk music fan, but as I've aged, I've come to appreciate the poetry and turmoil entwined in the genre. What do you get when you collect the best writers, actors, and director? You get a fantastic film. It's one of those rare movies I can watch whenever it pops on to my screen. Many huge stars, and Oscar Isaac is extremely impressive in the title character. He plays and sings and acts the hell out of it. John Goodman and Justin Timberlake were also perfectly cast.",1459382400,,486,4.351648351648351
6356721,5,B00JG4YXFY,"Pristine transfer, as one expects from Criterion.

As for the film,  what a joy it was to see this film. To me, this wasn't about the folk scene in the 1960's; it was biting social commentary on success in America. The Coens message, as I took it, is that sometimes the talented and best don't prevail. If you ever wonder why the talentless hacks make it in whatever field, watch this movie. Very entertaining, could not stop watching it. Beautifully shot, and the music was great too. I don't get the negative reviews for this film. This is complex storytelling and its not meant for people who need immediate gratification or everything spelled out for them",1459036800,,659,4.672413793103448
6356722,5,B00JG4YXFY,Fast! Great!,1458345600,,12,5.5
6356723,5,B00JG4YXFY,"My monthly Costco trips aren't complete unless I treat myself to a $20 Criterion title.  There are many times that I know what I'm looking for, and some moments like these, that I simply pick up something totally unknown.

I never heard of Inside Llewyn Davis, that is, until it was recently reviewed here.  It's theme is something of which I have no interest in -- mainly folk music.  However, the selling point for me was the Coen Brothers, and I figured that their reputation for bringing ""quirky"" stories to life would be an incentive enough to purchase.

So how did I like Inside Llewyn Davis?  I was completely amazed by it.  Yes, this film is based on the NYC folk scene during the early 1960s, but it's more about one man's road trip to......nowhere.  And, being a road trip movie, it comes with many interesting surprises along the way.  I went into this viewing blindly without reading who exactly starred in this film -- so I was really ecstatic about two major cameo appearances.

The success of this film lies solely on the back of it's main actor, Oscar Isaac, who plays Llewyn Davis, a struggling folk singer who's not about to abandon his career.  The film is brilliant, funny and touching.  Most of all, long memorable after the lights come up.  It's amazing this film didn't receive any Oscar nominations.

The Blu-ray presentation is as fantastic as one would expect from Criterion, whose transfer has been approved by the Coen Brothers.  Colors are rather limited, given the intended look of the film.  Detail is exquisite.  Projected on my 110"" screen, it looked quite remarkable.

If you are looking for something really magnificent to watch that doesn't follow the Hollywood playbook, I would highly recommend you pick this up if you can find it for $20.",1457827200,9,1777,4.732899022801303

8650642,5,B00JG4YXFY,"I absolutely love this Criterion release!  They hit the ball out of the park, as usual.  It goes without saying: the film, Inside Llewyn Davis is a quirky, under-seen, under-valued, and often misunderstood classic.  And you should see it for that reason alone!

However, the extras on this disc are phenomenal, truly fantastic!!  For starters, there is a lengthy interview of the Coen Bros. conducted by also famous director, Guillermo del Toro.  And their conversation together is brilliant and insightful.  There's also a conversation here between T-Bone Burnett, who put together the music for the film, and the Coen Bros.

The commentary by David Hadju and the old Greenwich Village documentary film, called ""Sunday"" are also dynamite!  Very cool stuff aplenty in the special features section of this blu-ray.

But the REAL gem here is the 101-minute Tribute Concert Film Criterion included, called ""Another Day, Another Time.""  This is awesome.  I've watched it several times now, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  The concert celebrates the music of the film--Oscar Isaac even plays a few numbers-- but also celebrates the music of Greenwich Village Folk Scene, circa early '60's.  And there are some great artists playing throughout the show: Joan Baez, Mumford and Sons, Avett Brothers, Punch Brothers, Gillian Welch, Jack White, Elvis Costello, The Milk Carton Kids, Colin Meloy (The Decemberists), and Conor Oberst to name a few.

This is truly the definitive version of this film yet released on any format for home video!  Buy it now, and do yourself a favor!  It serves multiple purposes for your viewing pleasure.  What more could you ask for?",1514073600,,1664,5.122676579925651

8650644,5,B00JG4YXFY,"This is my favorite film, so to be able to geek out even more with bonus features is just dandy. I do wish there was a commentary track with some of the actors though. That's the one thing that's missing. There's very little in the way of interviews with the cast.",1492300800,,264,4.196078431372549

8650646,5,B00JG4YXFY,Cinematic poetry with a few tunes to carry you through. John goodman is the cohens secret sauce. The sister is a huge problem and letting of is the response to all complex filmmaking these guys have that down. Each shoot is journey and reflection of the internal conflict of oberving your emotions while letting them go. Imperfectly by openly. It's a bonding experience of creativity.,1491177600,,384,4.923076923076923
