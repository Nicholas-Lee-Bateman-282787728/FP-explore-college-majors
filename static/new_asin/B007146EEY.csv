5046645,5,B007146EEY,"First, I cannot wait to get this DVD, I love these boys, they are fantastic.  Now I ordered this DVD but noticed from Il Volo on Facebook that there is a Standard Edition and a Deluxe Edition.  Up top Amazon lists another DVD but doesn't clarify the difference between this one and the other. I have now ordered both but really only want the Deluxe, which has 17 songs and the Standard has 15 songs yet the songs listed on the ""other"" DVD shown here on Amazon shows 15 songs with 2 from the Deluxe that aren't on the Standard.  So if this sounds confusing it's because it is.  I hope this gets clarification before these DVD's ship.",1328572800,29,632,4.330508474576271
5046646,5,B007146EEY,"This CD and the DVD are not yet released.  The three young Italian men who perform are unique and so very talented.  I have their original release and enjoy it thoroughly. You can check them out on their facebook page, several videos are available to view there. I am an American grandmother who grew up listening to my dad's 78 albums with some of the selections Il Volo perform ~ what lovely memories from three such special voices.  I am anxious for Feb. 28, 2012 to arrive, when the CD and DVD~ from their PBS appearance ~ will be released (after being shown on television.) Hope everyone will give themselves a special treat and latch on to their own copies !",1328400000,56,664,4.471074380165289

5046755,4,B007146EEY,"Wow.  This is a great introduction to a face of Italy that usually we don't get to see in popular culture.  When these boys appear on stage, as someone with hardly any experience with Italian culture, I can imagine the era of the Renaissance from their careful graceful carriage - as if they were wearing tights and PUFFED sleeves.  And I can feel how they are still part of their families, their parents but that they are old souls and someday will be old men and this really made me respect Italian heritage.

This is really a good video for all ages as there is something for everyone.  I only liked the song Il Mondo and enjoyed the song enough to find the translation of lyrics and was struck as I was with ""Best of Youth"" by the emotional richness and depth of the Italian people.  The first time I heard it, I also thought, ""wow, this is what Little Italy storekeepers were listening to?  Such depth and meaning - incomprehensible to non Italian speakers - all of this going on and we had no idea.""

All they hear is songs with no lyrics, just a few unintelligible words. Music has been dumbed down so much that Time/Life calls classical compositions songs in its TV ads. These teenagers can really sing real songs. I attended their performance at the B of A Pavilion in Boston, where in memory of the Boston Bombings they sang the Anthem a cappella. They brought the house down, and almost collapsed the tent. Only the Italians could form such a group. The album gets 4 stars because the sound, although very good is not perfect as it should be. I am an audiophile and very discerning. Most listeners would never notice that anything is amiss. Wonderful group of young men who don't have to jump around to prevent the audience's from noticing that they can't sing.",1383264000,15,911,4.6645962732919255

The audience response was the best I have ever seen which drove the performers to even better performances.

I was in another room, but as I came through on my way to get another cup of coffee, they also attracted my attention. I was instantly struck by both their youth and their great sound.
  I have played music locally for over thirty years so it did not take me very long to recognize their charm and professionalism. The very next time we were out my wife bought one of their CDs.

I loved the music of Il Volo takes Flight because it had familiar Melodies.
But never-the less the range and power of their voices is incredible.
and the standing ovations attest to the fact they are well loved.

Il Volo has become one of my favorite music groups. I had the privilege to see them recently in concert. And words can not describe how AMAZING the concert was. If you can't see them in concert,  I'd check out this dvd. This dvd does not disappoint. They sing songs from their debut album and classics.  If you like Il Volo, don't hesitate. This concert is amazing. Even if you've never heard of this group I strongly recommend you check out this dvd or some videos of them on youtube.

A local PBS station which was set earlier came on, and I heard these incredible, mature voices coming out of these baby-faced singers.  I was mesmerized and sat listening without moving a muscle until the program ended for a fund-raising break.  Until this, I had never heard of Il Volo.  After the program, I ordered two albums, one for myself and one for a friend who I knew would enjoy and appreciate these incredible singers.

Recommend this album?  Absolutely!",1349568000,,530,4.645161290322581

Il Volo has a way of captivating the audience with their extravagant vocal talent as well as with their ability to work well together on and off stage.
I recommend any patron of the arts to purchase this DVD, it is a performance worth watching over and over and over again.
5 star performance!
Great price!
Great group!",1348876800,,513,4.457446808510638
5047002,5,B007146EEY,"My wife and I purchased this DVD (IL VOLO) after watching the three young tenors on PBS for the very first time.  These singers are very talented teenagers whose vocal power is truly astonishing.  Whether they sing as a group or solo, they do so with great passion.  The harmony that they produce and deliver is flawless and outstanding (sharp, clear, delightful, invigorating, pleasantly resonant); and together with the singers' clean and wholesome appearance, good mannerism, humility and charm, the whole experience of hearing them sing is breathtaking.  With all due respect to the old three tenors (Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras), the new arrivals (Piero, Gianluca, and Ignazio) outperform the old; frankly, I think that they outperform Andrea Bocelli as well.  I wish that IL VOLO will remain in flight for a very long time, soaring higher and higher, and continue to bring joy to everyone who appreciates good music.  For all of these reasons, I highly recommend this DVD, but it should be noted that the sound/video quality can only be as good as the sound/video output capability of the TV and DVD player that you use.",1348617600,2,1131,4.98936170212766

5047055,5,B007146EEY,"I had never heard of Il Volo until I saw their PBS special a few weeks ago.  I've been a hard core rock and roll fan for over 50 years, but these guys have opened my eyes to a whole new genre of music.  They are wonderful in every way.  Received the DVD in just a few days, very very pleased with it. As another review mentioned, there are a couple of songs from the special that are not on the DVD, to my disappointment, but they are on the CD from the special.  Congratulations to Il Volo on their success and a long happy life to them.",1333152000,,538,3.9537037037037037
5047056,5,B007146EEY,"I loved the DVD of Il Volo that I purchased from you.  Il Volo is mesmerizing for me.  I have another , but a CD, so could only hear their wonderous voices.  To see them perform as well as hear their voices, is phenomenal.  Then a few days later, I saw their performance again on one of our PBS channels, so I got a double-delight. I yearn to be able to see them in concert.  Maybe when they come to Seattle Oct. 2? Thank you, Amazon, for bringing this wonderful music to us common people.",1333065600,,489,4.105263157894737
5047057,5,B007146EEY,"My 5-star rating is based upon my expectations, because I have not yet played the CD or DVD, hedging my bet of a possible return.  I bought the combination CD/DVD.  I resisted the inclination to lop off a star because of some confusion.  First of all, although I purchase most of my media at Amazon, I opted for a different seller, paying $21.96 (now listed @ $22.04) vs Amazon's $30.65.  My price discrepancy posting at Amazon went unnoticed.  I was about to buy the CD and exclusive Blu-ray at Amazon, but was put off by the 1.33 aspect ratio listed.  I could not confirm the accuracy of that info, but was informed via a Blu-ray forum that it was indeed full-screen, surprising and disappointing for a current Blu-ray. Amazon does not list an aspect ratio for the combo, but lists 1.33:1 for all other DVD versions. I decided not to splurge on a Full Screen Blu-ray. Having received the CD/DVD combo, the jacket lists the ratio as ""DVD Screen 16.9 Widescreen.""  If this is true, and if the Blu-ray is also Widescreen, I may still decide to return my combo, pay shipping, and purchase a CD and a Blu-ray.  That's why I have not yet opened my set.  It would be interesting to hear a comment from someone who has viewed the Blu-ray, and can confirm what the jacket says vs the actual ratio vs Amazon's info.  The only other disappointment is that the song ""La Luna Hizo Esto"" is on the CD only.  I would have liked to see Pia Toscano.  Maybe this cut shows up on the Blu-ray.  With so many versions, who knows?  After this is all settled, I'll relax and watch and listen to what I expect to be a 5Star experience.",1333065600,,1613,4.405405405405405

5047059,5,B007146EEY,"Unbelievable, Fantastic! My wife and I happened to catch this show on PBS one Sunday. I could not believe how great these three young men can sing. You would think they are twice their ages and have been singing all their lives. I am familiar with some Italian songs but I have to say that even though I did not understand the words in many of the songs, it really did not matter. That is how good I think they are. You get lost, caught up in the music and their voices.

I personally will buy the CD, not the DVD, but that is because I can play the CD in my car on the way to and from work.",1332720000,,591,3.925

Just hope that success does not change them.  It is fun to see their interaction.  Someone asked them at the concert in CT, how long did they plan to sing together and they said they hope for 40 years.  Hope that comes true.  Hopefully I will get to see them again when they are in Boston.",1332633600,,467,4.0
5047063,5,B007146EEY,"THIS DVD OF THE THREE YOUNG ITALIAN BOYS SINGING AT THE BEAUTIFUL DETROIT OPERA HOUSE IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  THE BOYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE WITH THEIR SUPERB VOICES FOR THEIR YOUNG AGES OF 16-17 & 18. THE SONGS WERE IN ENGLISH, ITALIAN AND SPANISH AND GOT A STANDING OVATION AFTER EVERY SONG FROM THE AUDIENCE.  THE BOYS HAVE AMAZING PERSONALITIES WHICH WERE WELL SHOWN DURING THE DVD.  I FIND MYSELF WATCHING THIS DVD OVER & OVER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DVD VERY STRONGLY...I PURCHASED THIS DVD AT AMAZON AND THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE...",1332547200,,540,4.723404255319149

5047065,5,B007146EEY,"I discovered Il volo while browsing youtube, for opera clips. I was so swept away by this kids, I only wished I had magical powers to promote their music as they deserved. Joking, as I have no such powers. The kids are amazing! I desperately searched you tube for whatever uploaded clip.  At that time they were 15-16 years old, and had no CDs, neither did they speak any English.
But after not too much time, they had their first CD. I could not find it here in stores, so I got it online.
Today I was looking for opera music DVDs that might be for sale at HMV store. I found this Deluxe Edition, for 15 bucks. I was so happy, and I bought it! I watch it now for the second time!
I love these boys, as they bring me memories from Europe...
They are amazing. Piero is very young, but I think he could really sing operas if he wants. Ignazio is very talented, but obviously he has no interest in opera, yet. Gianluca is the real crossover, being both operatic and pop. They are very good individually, but they are amazing as a group when they develop beautiful harmonies.
I am happy America gave a green light for such talented Italians!
Bella Italia! Molto grazie!",1332115200,,1165,4.319634703196347

It is amazing to see and hear the voices coming out of their throats. Their singing gives me goosebumps. I have already purchased two more DVDs for relatives who I know will also be blown away by Il Volo. This album is a combination of traditional and recognizable Italian songs, modern pop, and Spanish tunes. The young gentlemen are extremely talented and personable, and it's obvious they are enjoying themselves. Since they are ONLY 17, I'm looking forward to many, many more albums from Il Volo!",1332028800,2,670,4.545454545454546

They really put on a good show, too, that has you laughing at their antics and their interaction with the audience.  Plus, the songs are romantic, touching, heart warming, and sometimes toe-tapping!

I'm more than happy to share my thoughts on this absolutely astonishing concert. I've been a fan of Gianluca Ginoble, Piero Barone, and Ignazio Boschetto for the past year since seeing them perform on American Idol, the top 3 results show, last season. I was absolutely floored by how vocally powerful these teenagers were. I eventually purchased their debut album, both the regular and Spanish editions as well as their Christmas edition. I have never heard teenagers (other than Josh Groban when his debut CD came out when he was like 20) sound that way. Each one has powerful individual voices and together, it's just pure magic. Their concert was absolutely stunning. Not only was it vocally and technically perfect in my book, these three gentlemen really interacted with their audiences incredibly well. Granada is a song I had never heard before, this song is so vocally powerful! Mamma was beautiful! From beginning to end, their concert captivated and mesmerized me.

I saw this concert in Miami in October 2011 everyone loved it.  The selections were beautiful and the DVD was uplifting and fun to watch.  I love this style of music and nobody does it better than IL VOLO.  The DVD  includes a documentary of the boys career.  They are only 17 year old and they sound like seasoned performers, but sill have that boyish quality.  There is nobody out there like them.  I highly recommend this CD and DVD i bought both.",1331164800,7,614,4.392857142857143

This DVD made me re-live the great experience all over again and see them up close performing these great songs. They will never be sung again the way IL Volo sings them. An absolutely great purchase. I will probably buy two more copies for my in-laws that went to the concert with us. I also purchased the CD to listen to in my car which include a couple of songs that are not in their first CD or the DVD.,1331164800,13,497,4.081632653061225
5047073,5,B007146EEY,"I just saw this program shown on PBS.  It is amazing.  Three tenors of youth and vitality, no pomposity here at all.  They enjoy singing beautifully and lightly flirting with the audience.  They aren't exactly the same voices. One is a little darker, another brighter, and the third higher and more lyric.  They are incredible.  Their diction is good, their intonation is impeccable, and they are not automatons going through the motions of singing music.  They connect with the words, and they let their personalities shine through.  I'm seriously considering getting this DVD because it brought me that much joy watching them on TV.",1330905600,41,634,5.028846153846154

For those who have been wondering, like me: the DVD is the Standard Edition, which does not include two selections:  ""La Luna Hizo Esto (Featuring Pia Toscano)"" and  ""Funiculi' Funicula' & Reprise."" I suspected that would be the case when I ordered the DVD, but I couldn't find a link to order it anywhere else.

Those two songs ARE on the CD however (and you can see them on YouTube).  I'm not sure how one gets the Deluxe Edition; Does anyone know?  Perhaps it is being reserved as a thank-you gift by PBS?  There is a pledge drive this month and the Il Volo Takes Flight program is supposed to be aired on most PBS stations in the next couple of weeks.

Anyway, they are fantastic and deserve 5 stars regardless!",1330646400,2,743,4.333333333333333

5047079,5,B007146EEY,"I first became aware of Il Volo on The Talk back in February 2011.  Their voices, as well as their youth, were astounding.  I immediately pre-ordered their CD and was disappointed when the release date was delayed until May.  Fortunately, I had that performance on my DVR and I shared it with many until I could share the CD.  I also saw them on Ellen and, through YouTube, saw them on Idol and The Tonite Show.  Only problem was, they were always singing the same song - O Solo Mio.  Fantastic, but I wanted to see more.

I came across this DVD of a concert they did for PBS in Detroit.  It was on pre-order, but at least the release date wasn't delayed this time.  It just arrived and I just spent a delightful hour enjoying watching them perform.  They did mostly songs from the CD, but each one did a solo number giving you the opportunity to hear the strength of their individual voices.

After the concert, I watch the documentary.  It was very interesting to hear how they came together and the extent of the talent working with them.  Everyone from manager to orchestra conductor has a great deal of experience working with most of the best in the world of music today.  I hope the guidance they are receiving allows them to expand their possibilities.  They have the talent.  I wonder where they will be when they have the years behind them as well.",1330473600,40,1358,4.437246963562753
5047080,5,B007146EEY,The DVD arrived yesterday (Feb 28) and is absolutely wonderful.  I saw Il Volo in Phoenix last year and they are even better now.  Their potential is absolutely unlimited.  I pick out a new favorite every time I watch the DVD.  Right now it is GRANADA but could change again any time.  They seem less shy now and so their personalities are blossoming.  Their musical ability has always been superb.  I will be at their concert in Houston in September and can't wait.,1330473600,4,466,4.542168674698795
5047081,5,B007146EEY,"If you love IL VOLO, you will thoroughly enjoy this CD - new songs and a concert in your home. I paid a little more for the Blu-Ray edition and I'm glad I did. Was unable to catch them on their concert tour this past fall since I was out of the country, so very happy to watch them in a beautiful setting, (Detroit Opera House) and with Blu-Ray; it's like being in the front row. The only thing that would have made me happier with this DVD/CD, (I got both),  would be if they had included ""Tous les Visages de l'Amour"" - will still have to listen to that on YouTube but thrilled that I can now listen to ""Granada"" on the CD or DVD. LOVED the solos which highlighted their individual talents, the Detroit Opera Orchestra and the sweet attention to their mothers while singing ""Mamma"". They were a few moments (notes?) where they weren't entirely in sync with each other but with these three one can overlook it.

Can't wait to start walking to the CD - lost 30 lbs. so far with their first CD's (English & Spanish) and will use this one for the last 20!",1330387200,17,1053,4.233830845771144

Don't take my word for it, if you have not heard these 3 young men, look them up on Amazon, listen to the clips, and you can even see some videos on you tube.  Truly their voices, their talents are a gift, and the 3 of them together bring their listener full,rich,deep,touching,unforgetable music. I don't know if such has been heard in decades.
