8235579,4,B000ZJ2ZRW,"Denise (Darian Caine) is clearing out a closet. As this is a sexy film, she is performing this mundane task dressed only in pink undies. In fact, she goes through the whole film wearing only her underwear or less. Yes, if you get this DVD, you'll see Darian Caine in pink stockings and pink high heels. If such a prospect doesn't quicken the blood, you may want to check your pulse. Actually, Denise's dreadful husband, Harold (Clancy Fitzsimmons, aka John Fedele), must have ice in his veins because he is completely oblivious to his wife's charms. Expecting to see a plate of eggs on the breakfast table, he is instead confronted with the result of Denise's closet cleaning activities: a film projector.

If you're thinking that this is sounding a little bit like the scenario of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curious-Obsessions/dp/B000BYRCHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curious Obsessions</a>, then you'd be right. With the projector is a batch of film reels that contain old nudie loops. Naturally, when Denise or her sexy neighbor (the fabulous Molly Heartbreaker) look at these films, they are overwhelmed by the need to get naked.

With a fair amount of screen time taken up with the nudie loops, only three of Seduction Cinema's current roster of actresses are involved in this production and their scenes are spliced in with the older footage. If you've seen `Curious Obsessions' then you'll know what to expect of the old films that grace the screen in this production. In the bonus features, the nudie loops can be viewed in isolation and they are slightly naughtier than the edited material that is seen by Darian and Molly's characters.

`Curious Obsessions' was, more or less, just an extended music video with almost no dialogue to trouble its two stars, Bethany Lott and Jackie Stevens. The latter also appears in `Secret Desires' as one of Harold's employees who keeps finding her boss in compromising situations with his gay assistant, Tom (Duane Polcou). There's plenty of lowbrow humor as Fedele (sorry, I mean Fitzsimmons) and Polcou carry the comedy. These two are also in good form in the amusing spoof,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kinky-Kong/dp/B000FUTV5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kinky Kong</a>. The actresses in `Secret Desires don't get the chance to show their talent for comedy; all they're required to do is get naked and play with each other. Darian's aptitude for comedy is displayed to good effect in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sexual-Incantations/dp/B000Z6RH28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sexual Incantations</a>&nbsp;as she transforms herself from nerdy loser to sex bomb when she acquires a Ouija Board.

Molly Heartbreaker is, in my opinion, the most interesting of the newer actresses appearing in Seduction's productions. In her behind the scenes interviews, she comes across as a bubbly, warm woman who has a lot of fun working on these features as well as a lot of enthusiasm for them. Her tattoos are a quite striking feature on her body. In the bonus material on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-Hex/dp/B000O76Q16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex Hex</a>, she is interviewed naked as she shows them off.

The second disc in this package is a compact disc of the soundtrack music by The Taint. It's not terrible, but I don't think I'll be putting it on my iPod.",1206230400,9,3487,5.710982658959537
