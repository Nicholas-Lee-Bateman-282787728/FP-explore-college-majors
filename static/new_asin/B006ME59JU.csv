5004141,5,B006ME59JU,"An excellent behind the scenes look at International Mr. Leather XXX, complete with the history, future, and controversies the Leather community faces. As someone who has worked behind the scenes, I can vouch for the authenticity of Skiff's work. It rings true to my experience, and it captures the family reunion I have come to love.",1438905600,,334,4.982142857142857

5004146,1,B006ME59JU,"I wanted to see a historical perspective on leather and how it has changed and progressed.  However, I felt bombarded with anti-white messages.  WHAT?  I have to wonder why or how whites have become the new punching bags...and really?  Constantly calling me white does not help - I'm Northern European American.  No less than 3 different people were interviewed that said, ""America is browning so get on board or get rolled over."" ""I'm here to represent Latin, Black, and Asians because the whites have been here too long.""  I'm hear to show that this is not a white thing and we are all invited.""  OMG!  Yes, you are all invited, even the straights but why do you feel the racist need to bash on white people?  If whites came out of the closet in mass before you and started this and invited you, why do you now bite the hand of your brothers?  I became disgusted and turned it off - it's a racially charged hate piece that has leather in it.  I wonder how well this would be received if it were a piece that threw shade on gays or blacks or illegals?  It wouldn't and shouldn't be tolerated, same goes for bashing on us Northern European Americans.  We have feelings too.",1437091200,3,1173,4.450704225352113

5004149,5,B006ME59JU,"For those unfamiliar with International Mr. Leather, it as an annual event where literally thousands of Leatherfolk gather every May in Chicago. The centerpiece of the weekend is the International Mister Leather contest, in which men from around the world compete for the chance to promote the Leather Lifestyle (among other activities).

But it wasn't always like this. In a DVD that is destined to take a place next to the book ""25 Years Of Champions,"" ""Kink Crusaders"" chronicles the humble beginnings of IML in 1979 (12 contestants from 6 states) to the extravagant pageant that it is today. In 2008, documentarian Mike Skiff travelled to Chicago for the chance to capture the 30th year of IML as it unfolded. So as you would expect, this is the kind of film that is laden with imagery of Homomasculinity at its hottest, with pictures, interviews and event clips documenting every year of International Mr. Leather. (Including a brief but explanatory clip as a postlude from IML 2010.)

But once again, I have to repeat. ""Kink Crusaders"" is much more than a tableaux of hot men in leather. Perspective comes from a rare ""Mr Gold Coast Leather"" film clip to ongoing interviews with contestants and commentary from Guy Baldwin, founder Chuck Renslow and others (including the odd interlopers who found themselves inside the hotel as the contest was occurring). Mike Skiff and a host of contributors have created a grand history of this culture of leather in this magnificent 90 minute documentary. But if the thought of all those concepts and heavy thinking intimidates you, fear not. There are contest videos, and did I fail to mention that the pictures are hot? If you missed that earlier on, forgive me. I reiterate; the men are HOT. Get ""Kink Crusaders"" now. It's going to look great on your widescreen.",1333843200,6,1809,4.908496732026144

5004155,5,B006ME59JU,"I really appreciated hearing the history of the International Man of Leather competition. The title is quite sensational for the actual content, although there are some very 'candid and straightforward' moments.  An excellent documentary that put heart and soul into what at one time frightened me, even as a gay man. This documentary took away that fear. These are some good-hearted guys.",1447632000,,389,5.274193548387097

8500665,5,B006ME59JU,I vaguely know about the IML contest. This documentary gave me a better insight into the contestants. It also educated me about the history of the contest. Documentary she'd so much light on the organization. Very interesting and fun.,1472947200,,234,5.0256410256410255
