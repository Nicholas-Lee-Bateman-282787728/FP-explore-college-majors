1943846,5,B0000TGAH8,"My 2 yr old son LOVES this video - even picking it out from all of his other Elmo videos.  We've actually seen all three episodes on Sesame Street, on PBS, but it's nice to have them together.  For about 1/2 hour after watching the video, he'll walk around the house showing me his hands, ears and feet - and saying the words.  He has NO problem paying attention to the entire show.",1105401600,10,382,4.205479452054795
1943847,5,B0000TGAH8,"Our 14 month old daughter loves this video.  She is learning her body parts now, so this is a great way to reinforce her understanding of hands, feet and ears.  This is our first ELMO DVD, and I'd say it has been a big hit.  She seems to enjoy and pay attention to this more than the Baby Einstein series.  A great buy!",1100131200,7,319,4.015873015873016
1943848,5,B0000TGAH8,"I have 21 month old twins girls. They absolutly LOVE this video. As well, they absolutly love Elmo. They had no problem with following Elmo through his shows. I thought they're great myself. I would recommend this to anyone who has toddlers!",1078790400,,241,4.761904761904762
1943849,3,B0000TGAH8,"...Basically, three Elmo's Worlda about ears, hands, and feet.  My son (2 1/2). who loves Elmo, sort of stares at this one as if he isn't sure this is really his Elmo.  The three episodes are certainly okay, but I think what really bothers him (and me) is that they replaced the usual end music (Elmo's World theme) by a new song Elmo sings about ""having two"".  Normally, my boy gets quite excited at Elmo-dances around and shriekds with delite--but this one , I think he'd give it 1/2 thumb up.",1076025600,18,495,4.417582417582418

1943851,5,B0000TGAH8,"My 3 year old son and I have been enjoying this Elmo World DVD, the Mandarin Chinese Edition.  He loves it just as much as the English version.  And it's fun for me to see familiar words that we have already learned in Mandarin such as pai pai shou (clap your hands).",1360972800,,267,4.115384615384615
1943852,5,B0000TGAH8,"This is a great episode (or collection of episodes, rather). My daughter has actually learned sign language because two of the three episodes teach some words in sign language. It has been weeks since we've watched it, but both my two year old and my one year old still use their fingers to sign for a bird when they see one. Great job, Elmo!",1355788800,,342,4.359375
1943853,3,B0000TGAH8,"My item was bought ""like new "" and came extremely scratched.  Upon opening the case the Dvd wasn't even securely in place. Instead it was flopping all over the box. Disappointed in the not ""like new"" quality but the movie entertains my daughter and is overall very educational.",1340928000,,277,4.770833333333333

1943857,4,B0000TGAH8,Normally it takes watching a video a few times before my son will stay focused on something. Not with this video! He liked it right away.,1299024000,,137,4.3076923076923075

1943860,1,B0000TGAH8,"Did not get a confirmation from them until Amazon sent me an email saying that my credit card would not be charged because the seller did not respond.  The next day the confirmation from miasgramma came.  That was 8 days after I ordered the DVD.  Amazons policy states to be a seller through Amazon you are to ship the item within 2 days of receiving the order.  Then after the 8 days the item was not shipped for another 10 days.  I receive it 3 days later.  It took 3 weeks and only 3 days of that was shipping. Can't blame this one on the post office or delayed mail, just on poor customer service.  Would not order from miasgramma again!",1264809600,,641,4.24793388429752
1943861,5,B0000TGAH8,I purchased this for my 2yr old grandaughter.  She LOVES it! She loves to get up and imitate Mr Noodle.  She also counts along with them.,1237507200,,137,4.230769230769231

1943863,5,B0000TGAH8,"My 16 month old loves this - he got this for his first birthday - he just started getting into Elmo around 14 months or so, but he loves this one.  He really likes the beginning when it talks about hands.",1232064000,,204,3.975609756097561
1943864,5,B0000TGAH8,"I bought this for my baby and as long as she loves it and is kept entertained by it then it's all good to me. I know some people reviewed Elmo DVDs as stupid or lame but is it for them or for their kids to be entertained? I would agree if I was buying it for myself then would also I find it lame but it's NOT for me.  It's for my baby and as long as she is happy then that's all good for me.  That being said, I find Elmo very witty because some of the comments he makes only an adult would understand. Peace out.",1216684800,,514,3.706422018348624
1943865,5,B0000TGAH8,"Our 19-month old daughter LOVES Elmo. He's become a member of the family and has helped her learn concepts beyond the milestones associated to her age.

""Elmo Has Two"" teaches a child about hands, ears and feet. All of the Elmo World DVDs are clever and entertaining and follow a repetitive format that a child becomes familiar with which helps with the learning process. My husband and I can actually sit and watch them too! In fact, we have entire Elmo's World DVD collection.",1168473600,,478,4.690476190476191
1943866,5,B0000TGAH8,"We have numerous Elmo's World DVD and we find them to be a treat to watch (daughter 2).  We watch them everyday after coming home from daycare.  We say hi to Dorothy each time we see her.  We get a kick out of Mr. Noodle and Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle.  We just love watching the children on the show, brush their teeth, get new clothes on and I especially enjoy watching when Elmo asks the baby. Elmo's world is very education and plus for any child over 2.  My daughter wants to brush her teeth, get her shoes on, get dressed and do everything that the kids and Elmo do on the show. My daughter perfers Elmo, Barney or the Wiggles to regular TV. Two thumbs up, ELMO!",1141689600,6,673,4.186046511627907
1943867,5,B0000TGAH8,"My 20 month old son loves Elmo and this video.  He laughs out loud at Mr. Noodle.  The video has cute segments about hands, feet and ears.  Ahh, the invention of the portable DVD player and this Elmo video allowed us to go out to dinner with family (without chasing our child around the restaurant  - normal active toddler boy behavior).  Gotta love Elmo!",1128038400,2,355,4.484375
1943868,5,B0000TGAH8,"Like many kids, my daughter adores Elmo and has from an early age. She loves this DVD and probably could watch it every day if we let her. She even learned some of the sign language used in the DVD and she likes to wash her hands even more now. It is a perfect combination of Elmo episodes and they tie together well.",1127952000,,317,4.0476190476190474
1943869,4,B0000TGAH8,This is just one of the many Elmo DVD's my daughter has and she loves it. My baby is 19months old and watching her dance to elmo and knowing she's learning while she's watching makes me the proud dad I am. This is a good one folks,1107993600,,230,3.9148936170212765
