8577511,5,B00C5WR6I0,"A pelting rain storm did not dampen the enthusiasm of the Vienna music lovers who came to listen on this summer night to this exquisite performance of the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by an aging Lorin Maazel.

Superb camera directing moves between shots of the attendees, Schloss Schonbrunn, the statuary during certain pieces, and,  of course, Maazel and the Philharmonic. Exemplary of this touching operatic and symphonic evening is Maazel's soft-as-a-petal,  delicately ""played out"" ending of Wagner's Liebestod from Tristan and Isolde.",1531094400,,541,5.654320987654321
8577512,1,B00C5WR6I0,"I heard Lorin Maazel conduct Don Carlo at the Met last year. After the first act, I, and many of the people around me walked out. The tempos were so slow it drained all vitality and excitement from the music. It was like plodding through mud. And here, we have the same tempos for the same music, and the results have not changed. I recorded this on my dvr and during the I Lombardi aria, I turned it off and deleted it in disgust. The Vienna Phil deserves better",1392681600,,463,4.213483146067416
8577513,3,B00C5WR6I0,"Wonderful concert filmed in a distracting and, at times, torrential rain. You're more worried about the audience and performers, and whether they'll be washed away, than enjoying the performances. Perhaps next year's will be less wet.",1386633600,3,234,5.527777777777778
8577514,4,B00C5WR6I0,The Wiener Philharmoniker is my favorite orchestra.  I never miss their New Years Day concerts on DVD.  The Summer Night Concerts must be produced by a different team with annoying flyby shots and all sorts of distracting views of the crowd milling about rather than the orchestra playing.,1381795200,5,289,5.0
8577515,4,B00C5WR6I0,"This concert was played in the rain, but still work watching and listening to as it was amazing to see so many people sitting in the rain enjoying a concert!",1381190400,,157,4.266666666666667
8577516,2,B00C5WR6I0,"I already own two Schonbrunn's summer night concerts but this one is marred by an infortunate rain. I pity the audience but they held fast. My grief is about Maazel's conducting too bland and lacking dynamics.....
f you hear a faint echo after a fortssimo passage, don't blame the recording, it is the returning sound wave from the Schonbrunn palace in front of the orchestra.",1379721600,7,376,4.8
8577517,5,B00C5WR6I0,"I get this DVD just now, and watch it immediately This is good concerto. So I buy another two at Amazon for my friends .",1378512000,2,120,3.84
