8361335,3,B002BFXYI2,"1960's Messalina could never be described as a great movie, but it's at times slightly more interesting than the average peplum that was trotted off the Italian production line. Set shortly after Caligula's assassination (the opening image is of his blood slowly flowing down steps to his discarded laurel wreath) and dealing in part with the schism between the marginalized aristocrats and the new Emperor installed by the power of the Praetorian guard, it offers an interesting alternative take on Claudius' reign to the Robert Graves version. Here Claudius is an almost disinterested observer in the course of history - even an assassination attempt just provokes a curious glance to confirm that the force of history is conforming to its usual pattern before returning to discussion of matters academic while battle rages around him, aware he bores his courtiers but just as aware that they have to at least pretend to listen to him anyway.

Unfortunately Claudius is just a minor character (he probably gets only five minutes of screen time) and none of the leads are interesting enough either as characters or performers to really carry the picture: that he's far more memorable than tragic former St. Trinian's pupil Belinda Lee's scheming vestal virgin gone bad Messalina is a bit of a problem in a film called Messalina. It's only when she seduces an assassin at night, has him decapitated in the morning and then delivers his head on a platter to the disgruntled nobility who sent him in the afternoon that she makes much of an impression, and scenes like that are few and far between. As usual there are some persecuted Christians to save and a conspiracy to thwart along the way to a palace massacre that would do a Jacobean revenge tragedy proud, but it all feels a bit too business as usual to really stand out from the crowd. Two-and-a-half stars rather than three.

Of the two English-language friendly versions on the market, the German 2.35:1 widescreen release has much better print quality, offering English and German soundtracks and a stills and poster gallery.",1301270400,,2083,4.965616045845272
