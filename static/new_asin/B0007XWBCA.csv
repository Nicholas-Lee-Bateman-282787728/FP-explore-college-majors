I Love this show.",1507680000,,162,4.366666666666666
8053675,5,B0007XWBCA,"This series is by far one of the best!!! Enjoyed it when it was new, however, now it's very refreshing to get something good to watch!",1315094400,,134,4.1923076923076925
8053676,2,B0007XWBCA,"Although a great fan of the series, I am in agreement with other

reviews as to the compression, and the packaging (yes,read the warning about roving discs during transport, yes they roved!).

I still am at a loss to understand the reasoning behind the pilot episode incorporated in season 3, and am not overjoyed

with double sided discs...maybe in the future....?

Regardless(although it does detract somewhat),I am still a loyal

Due South addict, but will be less likely to part with the cash

for a package that appears to have had no thought put into its

presentation and packaging.
