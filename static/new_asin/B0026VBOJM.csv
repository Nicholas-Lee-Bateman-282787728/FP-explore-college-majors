3857397,5,B0026VBOJM,"How should an individual respond to deep-set social injustices - ones that are built into the structure of the country's national morality.  This is the core of Kaji's story (performed by the brilliant Tatsuya Nakadai).  This epic trilogy is a biography of a man, a dissenter, a nation.  During the critical years 1930's to 1940's, Japanese aggression was founded on radical nationalism, a policy which expected everything in its path to bend or break.  The director films the cruelty of Japanese and Russian authority with unflinching honesty. As is always true of this director...he is an absolute master of cinematography in the brilliant way we think Akira Kurusowa is a master of the same art.  As an example, after one of the Chinese slave laborers is brutally beaten to death, the group of laborers complain to Kaji - accusing him of being just like the other insensitive Japanese. The crowd of prisoners and Kaji are separated by an electric barbed wire.  Then suddenly - through the barbed wire - the prisoners view 30 comfort women approaching to service them sexually...almost as a mirage...and the complaint against Kaji drips away. It is a deeply powerful image - a form of cinema poetry and a form of cinema realism.

In the first installment of this extraordinary trilogy,  Kaji is sent to be an overseer of a Japanese slave labor camp in Manchuria.  At this time, the Japanese are using Chinese men or unlucky POW's for mining operations under inhuman, horrific conditions.  Appalled by the viciousness, Kaji proposes reforms and basic human rights for the prisoners...but in doing so he is considered an obstacle to the Japanese War effort and so the idealist is next sent into the military.  In the second installment,  Kaji challenges the military officers' cruel approach and humiliation of Japanese recruits. Again, he is unsuccessful.  This leads him to the third part where the Japanese army is routed by the Soviets. But the Russians are not the liberators the liberals believe them to be. Now for the third time, Kaji refuses to accept the Russian injustices.

What seems ""all important"" to the director Kobayashi is not the success of his quiet hero, but the very attempt - however futile - to challenge injustice, even alone.  Here we have a conscientious objector, sometimes portrayed by others as weak, who is actually more ready to put his life on the line than the soldiers.

As a final point, the film trilogy is part autobiographical.  Even though a soldier in the Japanese army, the film director Kobayashi refused to accept any position in the Japanese military system other than a private as a personal protest to its aggressive fascism.

Five stars...absolutely.",1242604800,51,2699,4.973273942093541
3857418,4,B0026VBOJM,"Pt I: NO GREATER LOVE Sprawling WWII drama that pits idealist Kaji against the Japanese war machine. He takes on a job as a labor camp supervisor in China to avoid the draft, which itself compromises his ideals, but you wouldn't know it from his insufferable holier-than-thou posturing. His dickishness really drags the 1st part of the movie down, but the momentum of the story's events makes the last hour riveting. Great Ford-like use of landscapes in key scenes: starving Chinese prisoners attacking a food truck, shots (like the one on the DVD box) of slaves en route to the mine, the arrival of the ""comfort women"" at the camp. Bold dutch angles in an execution scene make for an interesting contrast to PATHS OF GLORY. 7/10",1315008000,,729,4.748031496062992
3857419,4,B0026VBOJM,"The Human Condition has too many technical flaws, goes on too long, and, especially, its first 60% gets annoyingly moralistic and preachy at times (although Kaji does sink into a bit of justifiable depravity by film's end), to be considered an inarguably great film, but so much of the rest of it is assuredly great that it has to be in the argument for greatness, therefore I can term it a near-great film, even if, for many, it will seem an irredeemably depressing film; not unlike Theo Angelopoulos's The Weeping Meadow. This observation is true, but it is not a reason to avoid the film, nor art, because a work of art that depresses is not to say that it is not successful for that, if its depression spurs one on to cogitation over why this is. Also, criticism of the love that Kaji holds for his wife are all based on the assumption that the lead character is supposed to be an idealization of the average man rather than an example of the rare man, the potentially great man, who is denied his due. Therefore, the commonplace qualities of love and fidelity that a superior man holds become, in this misinterpretation, an idealized and unrealistically (capital r) Romantic flaw. But that is the flaw of the critics, not the artist.

  The film's equivocal excellence is probably no better exemplified than in its portrait of the Japanese Army. On the one hand the film seems to go a bit too light in its portrayal of the Japanese mistreatment of its Chinese victims (for with every passing year it seems that the Japanese Imperial Army made the Nazis seem like rank amateurs in human depravity), yet, on the other hand, the film does a great service in its humanizing of the average Japanese soldier from inhuman automatonic supermen to flawed misfits who often criticize and mock their superiors and the war's rightness. And while it abounds in caricatures and near-caricatures, the film also does an outstanding job of getting to specific moments of intensity (however prosaically- not poetically- rendered) between characters, in what would otherwise seem a mundane interaction. This allows for the speedy introduction of characters and building of empathy with them.

  The DVD, by The Criterion Collection, is one of the best releases they have had in the last couple of years. I've chided the company for skimping on audio commentaries in recent years, but this film's length, and the fact that it is spread over three disks, pretty much obviates any necessity for a commentary, and even an enthusiastic talking head like Japanese film expert Donald Richie or film critic Roger Ebert (were he healthy) would inevitably spend most of the nine plus hours on dead air. As usual, I wish all black and white films had easier to read subtitles than mere white font, but there are only a few instances of difficult to read wordings. Given that this film had an international release at a time when foreign films were routinely dubbed, it would have been great to have had an English language audio dubbed option, for likely one existed. There is an oddity in that there are Japanese subtitles on the right side of the screen for the Japanese audience, at moments characters speak Chinese. The fourth disk has all the supplements, and while it is missing an extended making of featurette, there are some good moments in interviews conducted with the film's director and star, and a short video bon mot of the film from Japanese filmmaker Masahiro Shinoda. There are some trailers and an insert essay, as well. But, this is there are DVD where the extras are really just that. Even with nothing, this film is worth seeing. It is also a very good restoration, in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, of the film compared to earlier VHS and DVD releases, many of which split the film into its three parts: No Greater Love (1959), Road To Eternity (1960), and A Soldier's Prayer (1961).

  The film's cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, is always solid, with a few moments of adventure- such as a shot as a tank roars overhead, but it is never spectacular. The scenes shot in a studio often clash with location shots, texturally. As for the use of black and white, no one is liable to confuse this film with the masterworks of an Orson Welles nor Michelangelo Antonioni. The film's score is one of its weakest elements, too often telegraphing `important' moments. Nakasdai's acting dominates the film, for he is in virtually ever scene, and his slow transmogrification from bleeding heart liberal who sells out to stoic killing machine (he's an excellent soldier despite his avowed humanism) who years for his wife is subtle, believable, and most importantly, lets the viewer empathize with him. There is never a moment where a viewer will think that Kaji would never do that; even in scenes where he stabs a Russian soldier or when he beats a Japanese Quisling, in the POW camp, to death with a steel chain, and pushes him into a latrine hole to drown. Of the many films I've seen in my decades there are few other film characters I have ever more identified with than Kaji (who is the Orient's equivalent of Kirk Douglas's Colonel Dax in Paths Of Glory). Granted, I am both more practical and prone to dispense justice more violently, but one of the film's strengths is that it offers a myriad of characters (and some which veer into caricatures) that all viewers can identify with; at least on the masculine side. Like most directors of his age, Kobayashi severely shortshrifts the female sex- they are either whores or angels, but, putting aside that unfortunate malady, Kobayashi is rare in that he is even able to humanize his caricatures.

  The Human Condition is one of those works of art that is not great, but has so much going on, at any moment, that it is not difficult to forgive its flaws- even those that glare, for another excellent or better moment will soon recapture your admiration. And, it's only in true epics that such largess is to be found. Excelsior!",1282780800,7,5964,4.751690821256038

3857421,5,B0026VBOJM,"However one may define the highest achievements of cinema, ""The Human Condition"" belongs in that panoply.

Other reviewers have provided excellent descriptions of the film's content, so there is no need to expound further on those details.

Suffice it to say that ""The Human Condition,"" so aptly named, speaks uniquely to each individual.  As does all great art.

""The Human Condition"" can be appreciated and interpreted on many levels --- one man's struggle to preserve decency and altruism in a savage world; one filmmaker's attempt to express the reality of brutal militarism to his own traumatized society; ...

My personal reaction to ""The Human Condition"" was akin to my reaction to Erich Maria Remarque's ""Im Westen Nichts Neues"" (in both book and film).

Whereas ""Im Westen"" was swept aside by Hitler and the Nazis, allowing Germany a collective amnesia of the horrors of World War I, Kobayashi's film has reflected and influenced Japan's determination to seek a different future after 1945.

My only regret?  I do not believe that Gomikawa's novel is available in English.  It would be interesting to see if the text which inspired the film has the same impact as the film.

Kaji will remain with the viewer long after the final frame.  He dies alone in a desolate wilderness.  But he does not die ""like a dog,"" as have so many of his countrymen.

Kaji dies with an unshakable dignity.

3857422,5,B0026VBOJM,"If you are still unpersuaded of ""Man's Inhumanity to Man"", you probably should watch this epic film. If you personally have trouble acknowledging guilt, and especially if you have trouble acknowledging societal guilt -- that is, your unescapable personal responsibility for the actions of your society -- you must watch this film. On the other hand, if you are Chinese, you perhaps ought to avoid this film; it is a soul-rending confession of the hideous cruelty practiced in forced labor camps. It will be too painful to watch, and it might well inflame resentments that would better be put on ice.

The Human Condition is beautifully photographed in black-and-white, every frame a calligraphic composition; beautifully acted by Nakadai Tatsuyo and a cast of familiar faces from the great age of samurai films, familiar yet completely 'in character' in this film; beautifully scripted ... and extremely long, 4 DVDs worth of bleak landscape, violence, and anguish.

Did it need to be so long? Director Kobayashi Masaki must have thought so; he worked on this film for four years, and his other supreme cinema masterpiece - Harakiri - demonstrates his mastery of terse editing and compaction of drama. Though it has 'chapter' titles, The Human Condition is NOT a series of episodes; it develops thoroughly and coherently as a single story. Critics have suggested that the central character, a young Japanese intellectual who resists the inhuman behaviors of his countrymen, is at least partially a self-depiction by Kobayashi, who was compelled to serve in the Japanese army in WW2 but who refused to rise above the lowest rank, in daring protest against the military warlords. Every scene of The Human Condition conveys, to me at least, a sense of the overwhelming importance of the total Truth to the filmmaker. Obviously Kobayashi was not seeking to produce an evening's entertainment, or a commercial bonanza, or even Art for art's sake. So, yes, I think it needs to be that long. It's the whole truth of a man's life.",1267056000,6,2022,5.032835820895523
3857423,5,B0026VBOJM,"""the human condition"" is by far the most difficult movie that I have gone through, not only for its length but for the truthful account of being a honorable human being under extreme conditions and the hefty price coming with it.
would Kaji have had a better fate had he just kept his ideals to himself and gone with the flow? In peaceful time maybe, but in wartime especially for a soilder of the defeated nation, it would be almost imposibble for him to escape other tragic events that still lead him to his fate. Of course in good times we all can afford to be a decent human being, but under extreme conditions, how many of us would not cast aside the so called ""principle"" in order to survive?

more like a mini series than a film (comes on 3 disks, over 9 hours) the length of this film actually enhances the expereince.
watched it over 3 nights, and at the end of each night couldn't wait to watch the next disk.

If you read all the reviews here , I am sure you will get a much more in depth review than i offer here. All i will say that this film is a masterpiece whose images will stay with you long after you have seen the film.

3857425,5,B0026VBOJM,"Masaki Kobayashi, the acclaimed director of Japanese classics such as ""HARA-KIRI"" and ""Samurai Rebellion"" has always made a powerful stance against established authority. He made a scathing indictment of the ""Code of Bushido"" and criticized the way samurai clans have treated its retainers and their families. Kobayashi's ""THE HUMAN CONDITION"" is his fearless indictment of the war itself that criticizes established authority. Based on the novel by Jumpei Gomikawa, this film trilogy is arguably Kobayashi's finest films, its strong existential themes, the manner of which it exposes the aspects of good and evil, and the thin line between morality and immorality is truly masterful. The trilogy focuses on the exploits of Kaji during World War II. Kaji's development as a man, as a husband, as a soldier, and later as a prisoner of war is brought to exposition by Masaki Kobayashi.

Disc One: ""No Greater Love"" (1959)
Kaji (Tatasuya Nakadai) is a young man who is a pacifist and a socialist. He marries his sweetheart Michiko (Michiyo Aratama) despite the uncertainties in the future. Kaji agrees to work as a mining supervisor in an iron and ore mining site in Japanese-occupied Manchuria to avoid getting drafted to fight a war he doesn't believe in. Kaji becomes partly successful in reforming the working conditions in the mining site, although his ideas are often contested by his superiors. Things become more complicated when Chinese prisoners of war are forced upon the site by the Kempeitai (military police) to use as laborers. Kaji tries but fails to reconcile his humanistic theories with the realities of forced slave labor under Japan's Imperial system.

Disc Two: ""Road To Eternity"" (1959)
After the climactic confrontation with the Chinese prisoners caused Kaji to lose his exemption from being drafted in the military and the fact that Japan is losing the war which makes the country more desperate for military servicemen, Kaji is now a hardened idealist. Despite being trained to fight a war he doesn't believe in, Kaji proves himself a capable soldier and tries to implement his humanistic idealism to the treatment of other enlisted men who are being brutalized by the veterans. The film reaches its unforgettable climax as Kaji is sent to the front line to fight off the advancing Soviet army.

Disc Three: ""A Soldier's Prayer"" (1961)
The Japanese Kwantung army is shattered as Kaji, along with several survivors embark on an epic journey on foot through miles of forest, desert, and fields southward in the hopes of reuniting with his wife. After Kaji survives perils including starvation and untrustworthy allies, he gets captured by Soviet forces that echoes the treatment of the Chinese prisoners meted out by the Japanese in the first film. Kaji eventually becomes disappointed that communism which he hoped would be the catalyst for human liberation, seemed no different from the oppressive systems he had struggled against. Kaji escapes into the winter wasteland in the hopes of reuniting with his wife Michiko.

The Review:
Hailed as ""One of the Greatest Films Ever Made"", ""The Human Condition"" is one film whose experience may seem inspirational but it also proves utterly depressing. This trilogy embodies both the flaws and strengths of humanity as it unrelentingly brings the faces of morality and decency into opposing sides against the natural instincts of men. The film may also prove to be inspirational as love and decency seemingly tries to find a way to survive amid the bleakness of whatever situation fate may deal one into.

The First film is the longest film of the three as Kaji takes his theories to improve the working conditions of the mining site. This is Kaji at his purest form as he tries to bring his theories into procedure. This is also where the main protagonists are faced with moral dilemmas as they try to weigh the rights and the wrongs. I loved the scenes when Kaji begins to question himself for his own decisions and the more he gets deeper into the situation with the Chinese prisoners, the more difficult it gets for him to face his wife. Kaji manages the rations and rewards the prisoners with prostitutes. The film makes a powerful statement in pointing out the potential successes of working together as embodied by the Chinese, but mistrust and suspicion becomes the main opposition for two races to work together. It also bleakly portrays the two sides of human nature as there are those who would stand to profit or take advantage of any situation at the cost of others; as kindness and understanding may sometimes prove to produce mixed results.

The second part of the film series portrays Kaji in the military, under suspicion because of his revolutionary ideas. The film exposes the politics in the military and the way, soldiers tend to mimic their superiors in the way they treat new recruits. In my opinion, this part is the most damaging critical indictment of the army. Kaji represents the reasonable side of the picture as he tries to protect the new recruits whose ages range from 40 years and above. At times, the majority of the Japanese authority are too willing to turn a blind eye to the problems faced by the new recruits as the veterans appear adamant in abusing them. The adage; ""Survival of the Fittest"" comes to mind, as Kaji is brought to the breaking point. Kobayashi also brings some visceral scenes of brutality and violence in this film. The Soviet advance into China brings both veterans and new recruits on the same side as they try to work out their differences.

""Road To Eternity"" also defines the word courage. Kaji's main goal is to survive that may make him seem a coward in the eyes of some but inside, he is courageous enough to admit that this fight is meaningless. For Kaji and his allies, it becomes disgraceful to die in a war like a dog. Kobayashi may also be making a commentary against blind obedience and that the Japanese army were more occupied in believing in their `honorable' war, than facing reality that their goals may indeed prove to be unjust. For Kaji, fighting this battle is more for a fight for survival than fighting for his own country.

""A Soldier's Prayer"" may well be the darkest and the most depressing installment of the three. While it does have its inspirational side, as it also exposes the strengths of humanity. Kaji finds reasons to hope, and to dream of freedom; in the hopes of reuniting with Michiko. This chapter also brings Kaji face to face with his morals as he is oftentimes forced to make decisions for the good of the many rather than the needs of the few. Children and old people have no place in this world, as the group is faced with starvation. This chapter also brings the consequences of being on the losing side of the war, as Japanese refugees are left aimless, hungry as the women are raped and abused, not just by Soviets but also by the Japanese themselves. There is a very disquieting sequence as a young girl retains of hope of reuniting with her parents despite being raped by the soldiers of the Red Army. She finds those hopes dashed when she becomes victimized by the very soldiers who were supposed to protect her. I found it hard to see some Japanese women offer themselves up as sex slaves to survive, at least until they can find male protection.

I suppose Kobayashi wanted to make a commentary on the manner that people tend to look out for themselves. It was real disturbing to see the Japanese prey on their own countrymen, most specifically in the POW camp. It was quite sad to see the Japanese prisoners become more abused by their fellow countrymen than by their own captors. Kaji and Terada would take food scraps to add to their rations, reported as sabotage by their Japanese superiors. Kaji tries to stay true to his own unwavering beliefs, but it is the evil done by his own countrymen that pushes him over his limits. Anger, envy, greed and pride are the film's main themes as the prisoners of war become faced with a situation worst than those experienced by the Chinese in the mining camps. Worst not because of the hardships, but made worst because of the fact that it is the Japanese abusing the Japanese.

Kaji is superbly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai. The man embodies the pride that one takes from himself, that pride slowly fades when forced into situations that makes him question his own soul. Education and principle are indeed virtues but one would never know just how one can react to a dilemma until faced with one. Other characters such as Okishima and Kageyama are also at the mercy of military policies and politics; even though they disagree with such policies, they still give in. It is difficult to stay true to oneself when faced with a truly testing situation. Michiko embodies the soul of the Japanese wife; true and faithful. However, the film brings a certain question as to her true whereabouts. Did Michiko manage to escape or did she fall prey to the tests of the flesh?

""The Human Condition"" is Japanese cinema at its best. It is very difficult to sit through the film due to its very depressing themes but one has to also see that sometimes from such desperation, courage and honor may still be born. Masaki Kobayashi bravely brings the questions of humanity into exposition; in the face of such trials and hardships, can courage, decency and hope still prevail?

A raw indictment of its nation's wartime mentality as well as a personal existential tragedy, Kobayashi's riveting, gorgeously filmed epic is novelistic cinema at its best.

As an extended symphony, Masaki Kobayashi displays three great movements. Manchuria, 1943. The disappointed humanism of our protagonist when he is assigned to a concentration prisoners camp(uncapable to make his expectations come true), leads him to experience the hellish ambiance when he is imprisoned and so, to suffer in own flesh the horrors of a close death until unbearable limits.

Film = three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; cinematography = 4.5 stars; score = four (4) stars.  Director Masaki Kobayashi's two-part (complete with scored intermission), moderately-sized, propaganda epoch using coal mining in China as a backdrop.  Scenes of high drama are often book ended by heavy-handed scenes that stretch credulity to the point of unintentional humor and self caricature.  Four prime flavors of protagonists bounce off one another in the Director's tale: a newly-hired, mine management-team member who is a compassionate liberal; conservative mine managers/labor-enforcers; military mine guards/minders; and ethnic/semi-ethnic ""Chinese.""  Kobayashi seems to be struggling to maximize the inclusion of events depicted in the original source material (a super-sized contemporary novel) that results in loss of dynamics and consistency especially in the second half of the movie (the latter is also too long).  The Director provides a number of truly startling and indelible scenes including:  half-dead/dead Chinese slave labors being disgorged/pulled from sardine-can military box cars; and the execution (by samurai-style beheading) of slaves who may (or may not) have tried to escape.  Exterior scenes shot at an immense open-pit coal mine in China are spectacular (the coal mine is the real star of this film!). Kobayashi also displays many hard-to-swallow oddities starting with his film's central plot point:  a conservative mining company hires a left-wing, college student (who thereby avoids military call up) to booster the management team of a brutal and labor-intensive mining operation in far off China.  There are many more.  Among my favorites:  the absence of any freshly mined coal (just pieces of jagged light-colored ""ore""); a 3,300-volt electrical fence (to prevent Chinese slaves from escaping) complete with an impressive high-power infrastructure, but no visible means to power it all; labored Chinese dialog phonetically delivered by Japanese actors (ethnic Chinese physical and voice actors seem to be among the missing); and Chinese ""comfort women"" depicted as seasoned pros who clearly seem to enjoy practicing their profession (""happy hookers"") and are never fully booked (about 50 sex workers are supposed to be servicing 10,000 non-slave and 500 slave labors!).  Acting is OK but trends toward the histrionic and hammy in the second half of the film.  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are excellent.  Score is very good, but tends to have too many redundant phrases in its orchestration.  Subtitles can be a bit long given their rapid flash-by rates.  Most signs, armband, etc. are translated.  Audio distortion mars the orchestral recording for the opening credits.  Restoration is as good as it gets--the film looks like it was just released!  Just go with the flow in this partial rewrite of history.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; cinematography = 4.5 stars; score = two (2) stars.  Director Masaki Kobayashi's Parts III and IV of the overly-contrived adventures of a fish-out-of-water protagonist.  The Director's initial film (Parts I and II) dealt with a left-wing radical college student pitted (no pun) against the management of a conservative coal mining company brutally operating a huge open pit mine in Manchuria (no surprise as to who prevails, of course).  This time out, Kobayashi pits the de facto Communist against the Japanese Army in Manchuria!  A masochistic photo play that seems bent on driving home the message that war is hell, but the brutality of gang wars in army barracks is just as bad (or even worse!).  It is painfully (no pun) obvious that the Director is trying to squeeze as many vignettes from the source material (a massive contemporary novel) as his production budget will allow into the movie, since one micro dramatic event randomly follows another (usually bridged with fade outs).  The result is that Part III is way too long and just plain boring.  Part III is also crammed with repetitious bouts of face slapping and beatings (mostly in the barracks) which seems to comprise the major part of training for new recruits.  (A lot of the heavy-duty face slapping looks to be real--and stunt actors do not appear to have been used!)  Part IV (also loaded with face slapping) is less than exciting until the Soviets declare war and launch an impressive tank attack against a pitifully trained and under equipped Japanese Army (the Japanese are shown to lack war machinery, machine guns, automatic rifles, and even ammunition--but they do have shovels and know how to slap faces!).  There is no intermission this time. (Perhaps the producers were fearful of the audience not returning for Part IV?)  Once again, Kobayashi fills the screen with many hard-to-swallow oddities beyond the usual David and Goliath plot.  My favorites include:  the many face-slapping riffs on classic Three Stooges shorts including slapping Army nurses; frequent dialog references to ""The Front"" which is never defined and begin way before the Soviet declaration of war and their invasion; near drowning in a puddle-sized ""lake""; the extraordinary power of ancient Confucian principles (of absolute obedience to higher authority) to prevent well-deserved mutinies (perhaps not a real oddity?); and the ludicrous power of romantic love which causes a bride to leave college in Tokyo, move to a Manchurian pit mine, and STAY THERE after her husband has been drafted!  Acting is perfunctory and often melodramatic, since the majority of lines are delivered by shouting (which quickly becomes tedious).  Characters are often hard to differentiate except in close-ups (which seem under used), as they are costumed and made-up to look pretty much indistinguishable in medium and long shots.  Actress Michiyo Aratama delivers a disappointingly limp cameo performance even though she would seem to have free reign as the sole leading actress (there are two other actresses playing very minor roles).  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are excellent.  Restoration is excellent.  Subtitles/translations are OK.  Aside from the opening credits, the score seems to have been recycled from the initial film and is injected when least appropriate.  A scene distracter rather than an enhancer.  Not particularly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

Film = two (2) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; cinematography = 4.5 stars; sound (remastered) = three (3) stars; score = two (2) stars.  Director Masaki Kobayashi 's Parts V and VI of an overly-contrived (and overly long) WW II epoch fail to reverse the spiral of increasing tediousness engendered with each succeeding installment.  In these last two, the male protagonist leads (sort of) a ragtag assortment of army and civilian survivors wandering around the landscape (or around a remote Soviet POW camp) and going nowhere in post-war Manchuria.  Seems fitting for a film that essentially goes nowhere (and is very, very slow in getting there!).  Elements repetitiously sprinkled into the overall scenario include: the impact of imminent starvation; groups of Japanese circumstantial comfort women (who lost their husbands during the war); Japanese bandits (remnants of the defeated Army); well-armed (by the Soviets) Chinese farmers out for revenge; and Soviet Army units rounding up Japanese men for post-war POW slave-labor camps.  Part V is grossly padded with events/happenings the ragtag group encounters as it trudges about.  And seems to end only when most/all of the elements from the original source material (a six-volume novel) have been covered.  In addition, it includes many flashbacks using scenes from previous episodes to break the monotony and help with the padding.  Part VI also contains a fair amount of wandering-around padding (especially at the end) and is loaded (likely do to the original source material) with increasingly irritating voice-over homilies/mini-gospels) about the politics of life and romantic love (the voice of the protagonist's wife keeps popping up on the sound tract with the same verbiage).  This episode contains a cameo appearance by distinguished actor Chishuu Ryuu who is miscast (and sure acts it!) as the elderly leader of a group of widowed farmers bent on finding new husbands who are well armed!  There is no intermission.  Costumes (especially head gear) help the viewer to quickly identify who belongs to which group:  the Chinese all wear the same coolie-style hat; Japanese soldiers always wear a standard Army hat (with a center-star logo) or a hard hat; and Japanese women are usually bare headed.  (Soviet soldiers are easily identified by their girth and pristine uniforms.)  Russian line readings by nonJapanese sound like Russian (or pseudo Russian) is being spoken.  The amusing phonetically spoken Mandarin by Japanese actors is reduce to just a few lines this time (but there is some ""interesting"" phonetically spoken Russian).  Kobayashi again fills the screen with many hard-to-swallow oddities beyond the usual David and Goliath plot (this time it's a tale about a text-book Communist taking on the management of a Soviet POW camp).  Among my favorite oddities:  Japanese troops abandoned and cut off from outside communications still manage to be well informed about current WW II events in Europe and the Pacific; the total absence of comfort women portrayed as sex slaves; no one has a compass; hacking through ""jungle vegetation"" so anemic that using a Swiss Army knife would be overkill; and Soviet soldiers singing in perfect multipart harmony.  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are excellent.  Restoration is excellent.  Subtitles can be overly long and flash by too quickly (which is why there are rewind and pause buttons on your remote).  Some Russian dialog (including singing) is not translated.  Same for several signs/banners.  Aside from the excellent opening credits music, the score acts like a hammer and treats scenes as if they are all nails (music editing misalignment is the norm)!  Sound has been remastered to provide some surround-like effects which is not all that successful (especially for characters speaking from the sides of or off the screen.  Not recommended.

8353647,5,B0026VBOJM,"The British film critic David Shipman described The Human Condition - Masaki Kobayashi's 9.5 hour epic - as ""unquestionably the greatest film ever made."" I raise that straight up, because any film calling itself `The Human Condition' holds promise of great profundity; and praise as singular as Shipman's indicates it may have fulfilled that promise. So does it? I will concentrate on that question, but before I do, let me deal with some formalities first...

The 9.5 hours do not run unbroken. Whatever its merit, I think we can be thankful for that. Kobayashi followed the structure of Junpei Gomikawa's mammoth novel and divided the film into three separate parts - the first of which is No Greater Love, a title taken from Christ's description of unconditional selflessness, ""Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""

The film was made in 1959; it is black and white; and while the acting is slightly mannered, it is not too distracting. Set against the backdrop of Japan in the years surrounding WWII, it follows Kaji, a young idealist, as his idealism is tested, and worn away by the brutal realities of life.

The plot runs something like this: Kaji is at first given dispensation from the war, so that he can take up the role of mine supervisor. It so happens that the mine uses Chinese prisoners for its labour, and Kaji finds himself sympathising with them. Kaji quickly learns though, that his ideals are not shared - indeed he finds himself hated by all parties - his superiors, his workmates, and even the prisoners, who see him as smug and self-serving.

There is then an uprising by the prisoners and suspicion is subsequently directed against Kaji. As punishment he is drafted into the army - which is where No Greater Love ends.

That then is an outline of the plot. So to the real question - does No Greater Love succeed as a depiction of the human condition?

The Australian biologist Jeremy Griffith, whose work focuses on explaining the human condition, suggests that humans are born with unconditionally selfless instincts - the type of love described by Christ, and referred to in the film's title. However,when consciousness arose, we found ourselves at odds with those instincts: ""When our intellect began to exert itself and experiment in the management of life from a basis of understanding"" says Griffith, ""in effect challenging the role of the already established instinctual self, a battle unavoidably broke out between the instinctive self and the newer conscious self"" [...].

As a result of this battle, ""the intellect was left having to endure a psychologically distressed, upset condition, with no choice but to defy that opposition from the instincts"". This defiance took the form of anger, alienation and egocentricity - characteristics inimical to ideality, and which constitute what we recognize as `reality'.

The human condition has been having to live under the implication that we are bad for this defiance, when in fact we are not; and the human journey has been a journey undertaken in the hope and faith that we would one day find sufficient knowledge to exonerate ourselves. It was this hope that kept us going despite all the self-corruption we suffered, both individually, and as a species.

Kobayashi's film succeeds as an allegory for our condition not just because it is a recognition of the fate of idealism in the world, but above and beyond that, because Kanji's obdurate, stubborn refusal to stop - his determination to keep going, despite the horrors that he has to undergo - represents our belief that humanity is essentially good, despite all appearances, and that one day we would gain the knowledge needed to liberate ourselves from insecurity - if only we just keep going. Kobayashi's film resonates mightily in this context.

The poster chosen for the movie gives a great insight into Kobayashi's view of the human condition, and the underlying theme of the movie, showing in silhouette a line of soldiers marching up a steep slope. In spirit it closely resembles the famous picture by Katsushika Hokusai, Under the Wave Off Kanagawa, showing fishing boats plowing forward through terrifying and remorseless waves. It is worth noting that Under the Wave Off Kanagawa is also a picture used by Griffith to illustrate humanity's courage in continuing to search for knowledge despite the self-corruption it brings. Perhaps the Japanese ethos contains a particular recognition that stoicism is required in the face of the human condition.

In the end, Kobayashi's triumph is that he has created an allegory that reminds us of the real journey - humanity's journey - the one that we are all involved in. True, it is not a comfortable reminder - this takes discipline to endure - it is perhaps entertainment for a samurai - but the reward is an honest depiction of our condition, one that reminds us of our heroism. And there is immense pathos in that.",1360540800,13,4951,4.931572629051621
8353648,5,B0026VBOJM,"It's hard to do the ""The Human Condition"" justice in a brief review, other than to say that you should watch this trilogy. Don't bother to read the review, just go out and get a copy. It's the kind of worldview shattering and enlightening film that proves what a powerful medium cinema can be.

Set during WWII in Japanese occupied Manchuria the film follows Kaji, an educated Japanese man that questions the morality of his society. A upstanding man of pacifist sentiments he is forced to work as an administrator at a labor camp (with Chinese slave laborers), always under the threat that if he does not he will be drafted. Throughout the films his morality is tested by the trying circumstances, raising questions about what makes us fundamentally more than mere animals.

The director, Masaki Kobayashi, himself was a pacifist that was drafted into the Japanese Army during the war, one feels that he is to some degree telling his own story through making this film. It must have taken great courage for him to raise the questions he did about the conduct of Japan in China when he started making these films in 1959. The actor who plays Kanji, Tatsuya Nakadai, is also to be praised because he turns into one of the most incredible performances to ever appear on screen.

What are you waiting for? Go watch this film. It's gut wrenching but one of the most brutally honest depictions of humanity you will ever see.",1349481600,2,1419,4.690763052208835
8353649,5,B0026VBOJM,"Follow Kaji, a Japanese humanist, pacifist, and socialist, who is forced to live in a state of constant contradiction as a labor camp supervisor, then a soldier, and finally, as a POW during WWII. What begins as a basic story about a man that just can't catch a break, soon transforms itself into a gorgeous, superbly acted, and direct parallel to Albert Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus.

I have never seen a film more directly address the modern dilemma: finding and maintaining true humanity. Kaji, despite his faults, is one of our best examples to hold onto. His journey is both devastating and remarkably hopeful. He is a man who becomes worthy of the name ""man,"" and he fights to maintain that description. The Human Condition earns my highest possible recommendation. Watch it!",1329004800,,781,4.87218045112782
8353650,5,B0026VBOJM,"The Human Condition is excellent. It might be redundant to mention but the movie is over 9 hours long. Don't let that daunt you. The film never meanders and is far from redundant; it is merely as thorough an adaptation of a single novel ever filmed.

The Criterion Collection version is presented over four dvds. Three contain the actual movie and there is a fourth with some supplemantary material. My only gripe is that there is no commentary track which are always helpful and are a highlight of  Criterion releases.

Tetsuya Nakadai stars as the Kaji, the protagonist, and he carries the film expertly. Rarely is his character off-frame and about a five hours in I realized that this was one of the great screen performances ever given. Nakadai accomplishes the daunting task of holding the viewers interest through each and every trial he faces (574 minutes of them!). Those familiar with Japanese films will also note some fine performances from Susima Fujita, Minoru Chiaki and Kunie Tanaka.

The two common knocks on The Human Condition is that it is too didactic and that it is not Kobyashi's excellent Hari-Kiri. On those points I'd agree that while it is didactic the plot and pacing keep it riveting enough to prevent the film from ever getting to preachy. I never felt I was being 'taught' a lesson, just 'learning' one. As far as The Human Conditon not being Hara-Kiri, well, Kobyashi directed several classics including the former and Kwaidan and Samurai Rebellion as well. The Human Condition is not the least of them.",1322956800,5,1534,4.843511450381679
