8758036,3,B01E7ZOSBU,"Katharina Wagner shocked the opera world with her radical direction of DIE MEISTERSINGER VON NURNBERG, when she took over her great-grandfather's theater at Bayreuth in 2007. It was a chaotic jumble of a production, with iconoclastic ideas tumbling over each other to be seen. But it also posed a forceful challenge to the established idolatry, and its final scene was a stimulating as anything I have seen in the opera house for years.

This 2015 production of TRISTAN UND ISOLDE is more of a piece. It is iconoclastic, yes, but there are fewer sacred cows in this opera to be slaughtered. Its physical staging is once again more complex than it need be, but Wagner's direction of her singing actors shows an assurance that she simply did not have back then. And she has the advantage of strong collaborators. Both American tenor Stephen Gould and German soprano Evelyn Herlitzius look good, and they sing with an impressive dynamic range, excelling particularly in the quieter passages. Christa Mayer as Brangne and Iain Paterson as Kurwenal (another German and a Scot) give strong support, and Christian Thielman's conducting is assured. Musically, this would not be my top TRISTAN -- that is still the old Flagstad recording with Furtwngler, though Sir Simon Rattle blew me away at the Met last fall -- but it is nonetheless a fine response to the score.

Like the recent Met production, Katharina Wagner's designers, Frank Philip Schlmann and Matthias Lippert, offer a modern steel ship architecture for the first act, with bridges, railings, and stairs, stairs, stairs. Indeed, it seems more like a nightmare space imagined by M. C. Escher, whose connecting links gradually get removed until it seems impossible for anyone on that vast structure to reach anyone else. Intellectually, it is interesting to emphasize isolation and the impossibility of connection. I can imagine it working well in the theater, where one can take in the set as a whole. But it is ill served by the video production, which starts in the prelude by exploring its many passageways and blind exits, and then keeps shifting perspective in the opera itself, including shots taken from above and behind, gratuitously showing angles that the audience would never see. All we get here is claustrophobia and confusion.

If the set enhances isolation, it also denies privacy. All four of the major characters are onstage throughout the opening act, so that Isolde is actually present when Kurwenal insults her, and Tristan overhears all she says to Brangne. There are no secrets, and thus no need of any love potion. Katharina Wagner makes no secret about the fact that Tristan and Isolde are attracted to one another from the very start, and the anger of their first scene together has an intense erotic edge. Her solution to the oath drinking scene, when both think they are holding a vial of poison, is utterly brilliant, and truer to the essential spirit of Richard Wagner's drama than anything I have ever seen. It was seeing this moment in a clip that made me go on to buy the whole thing; I am not sorry I did.

Act II is a similar mixture. Wagner goes against many of her great-grandfather's instructions. Tristan and Isolde do not hide in a darkened garden but meet in a kind of bear pit lit by searchlights and watched by security personnel from an observation gallery above. They know this, and defy it. Their duet leads not to lovemaking, but to a suicide pact. And cuckolded King Mark (brilliantly played by Georg Zeppenfeld), is coldly furious rather than sorrowful. He carries a knife throughout his aria, which at the end he orders Melot (Raimund Nolte, perfect!) to plunge into the bound and blindfolded Tristan. All of which, though surprising, does have a certain logic.

But once again the filming makes an already strange set very difficult to understand. The fact that Brangne and especially Kurwenal are trapped in the bear pit along with the title characters makes for much distraction in the first part of the great love duet, abetted by a restless camera. The curious steel cage that appears for the second half of it seems pretty pointless, although it provided a greater variety of groupings than you usually see. While the attempted suicide was a good idea, it is hard to see how you can slice your wrist on the rounded end of a polished steel bar. As alas in her MEISTERSINGER, Katharina Wagner does not seem to see the inherent problem of being concrete and symbolic at the same time.

So to Act III, for my money the tour-de-force that makes or breaks a production. And in this case? Breaks it, I'm afraid, despite the many good things it contains. What it lacks is transcendence -- and if a production of TRISTAN cannot deliver that in the end, what is the point of suffering all the angst that comes before it? I certainly can't blame the conductor; the music was as searing, as vibrant, as ravishing as you could wish. Few tenors can sustain the terrible demands of this act in live performance, after the two that have gone before. Stephen Gould was not perfect, but no worse than most. But I do blame Katharina Wagner for leaving him exposed for most of the act, without visual or dramatic support.

Once again, she starts with something quite unexpected. In place of the usual sun-bleached clifftop, we have a group of five people sitting in darkness around a body, as though in a wake, lit only by a lamp in the ceiling. It is a rather beautiful effect, actually, like something by Caravaggio. But it takes up only one corner of the stage. During his delirium, Tristan moves out into the darkness, where various visions of Isolde appear, above, behind, and beside him, all in curious hard-edged blue triangles that come from nowhere and utterly lack poetry. Various surreal or even gruesome things happen to the Isoldes in these triangles, but this is no help at all to a Tristan who must sing and act one of the most difficult scenes in the repertoire while wandering in a blue limbo, with no interaction either with the characters who are supposed to be onstage with him, or with his imagined Isoldes.

All right, that leaves the final scene -- but I am sorry to say it is just a mess, with the other surviving characters, Marke and Brangne, confusing the picture, and Isolde clumsily moving Tristan's body into a sitting position. And while I could accept Wagner's new take on the King earlier, it simply does not make musical sense here, and the callousness of the ending will shock many listeners. I had hoped to give this production at least 4 stars, because it was musically solid and interested me all the way. But this last act removes a vital dimension and with it, I'm afraid, that fourth star.",1484438400,2,6719,4.776247848537005
8758037,1,B01E7ZOSBU,"First of all the mise-en-scne is absurd, meaningless. In Act I, for example, Isolde says: ""Herr Tristan trete nah '."" (Mr Tristan, come in) For what? He is on the scene with her all the time. The attempt of King Marke to force Isolde to perform oral sex at the end of the second act is a complete lack of common sense. Evelyn Herlitzius sings well when hatefully but gross to sing the lyrical passages. Stephen Gould is out of tune all the time, and in the third act screams like a madman. The end of the Liebestod with King Marke leading Isolde though grossly conflicts with the soft music that Wagner wrote. The only good thing is the musical direction of Christian Thielemann and the magnificent orchestra. Another eurotrash from Bayreuth. Poor Wagner",1475625600,5,754,4.634328358208955
