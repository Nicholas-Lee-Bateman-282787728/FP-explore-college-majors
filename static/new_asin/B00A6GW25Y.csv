8546982,4,B00A6GW25Y,"A good lower budget lower quality horror. Almost had a made for TV scifi channel or chiller feel. Great for a cheesy b movie night. Not the typical Japanese film, therefore will give you a bit of something different.",1465257600,,216,4.564102564102564
8546983,3,B00A6GW25Y,"I liked it. It's kinda short at about 80 mins but it gets a lot done. It does have a pretty original ending, and I liked the Japanese speaking German kinda priest- lumberjack. (You'll get it when you see it!)  ;)",1421280000,3,212,4.170731707317073
8546984,2,B00A6GW25Y,"Possession in Japan is the Japanese take on the Exorcist. The isn't really scary nor is it really suspenseful. It's one of the weaker J-Horror flicks out of Japan. My advice, don't bother with this one.",1373846400,2,202,4.638888888888889
8546985,4,B00A6GW25Y,"I've seen plenty of exorcism films, but never one from Asia. A great film with an awesome twist at the end, one you would never expect, and one that I don't think ever done in any exorcism flick. The CGI effects were done just right where it didn't look fake. Plenty of scares and edge-of-your-seat excitement! From Tokyo Shock in widescreen, 2.0 surround, english subtitles.",1369353600,8,375,4.7846153846153845
