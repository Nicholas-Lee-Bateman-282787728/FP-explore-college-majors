4460350,4,B004RBC5RO,"WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. Pat Patterson - Pat went straight after Bob as soon as he got in the cage with both men stopping each other from escaping various times. Both had various moments fighting on top of the cage with both eventually bleeding as the match progressed. This was a good brutal match for it's time with Vince perfectly described the match on commentary, ""Not designed to be scientific, it's no holds barred.""
""MSG"" Sept. '79

WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. Jimmy Snuka - A lost gem here as this was back when Jimmy Snuka was a heel & managed by Capt. Lou Albano with the special stipulation that you could only win by leaving through the cage door. This match started off slow with both men wrestling each other before Backlund turned it up & started ramming Snuka into the cage causing him to bleed to the point where Backlund had it on his leg & fist. This match is most memorable for Snuka jumping off the top of the cage...and missing which would be overshadowed later by when it jumped off the cage & landed onto Don Muraco.
""MSG"" May '80
[Legends Of Wrestling: Hulk Hogan & Bob Backlund]

Bruno Sammartino vs. Larry Zbyszko - Josh Matthews & Matt Striker did the commentary on this match as it was ""Student vs. Teacher"" between these two. Matt Striker said it on commentary that this was a ""knock down, drag out fight"" as both men were using the cage as a weapon various times along with just fighting with stomps & chokes & punches. Bruno hurt his shoulder at one point allowing Larry to work over it & even causing it to bleed taking away Bruno's power advantage while Bruno retaliated by being able to bust Larry's head open using the cage. Good historic match here.
""Showdown At Shea"" Aug. '80

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Kerry Von Erich - Freebird Michael Hayes was a special referee here while his fellow Freebird partner Terry Gordy was guarding the cage door to ensure that it was going to be a fair fight between Kerry & Flair. Both men traded momentum back & forth with each man having the same strategy of working on each others legs with Kerry also causing Flair to bleed. Michael Hayes at times got very physical with both wrestlers just to enforce the rules to the point where he was arguing with the regular referee when he kept telling him to back off but when Flair pushed him one time too many, Hayes just went off & tried to help Kerry win the match but lead to a complete misunderstanding to the point where it started one of the most infamous rivalries in wrestling history.
""WCCW Star Wars"" Dec. '82
[Triumph & Tradegy Of World Class Championship Wrestling]

NWA Tag Team Champion Ivan & Nikita Koloff vs. Rock `N Roll Express - The Koloff's had Krusher Kruschev in their corner on the outside of the cage while the Express had Don Kernodle in theirs. R&R used their speed to their advantage early by constantly making quick tags to keep a fresh man in while isolating Ivan Koloff to the point where he was bleeding. Nikita finally broke their momentum & worked over Gibson to the point where he was bleeding too building up to the hot tag. This was classic tag team wrestling but keep watching afterwords as the Koloff's showed why they were so dangerous by attacking everyone in sight.
NWA Starrcade '85

Road Warriors vs. Michael Hayes & Jimmy Garvin - The Warriors were out for revenge for losing their AWA Tag Team Titles & this was just a powerful dominate performance from the Warriors to the point where Michael Hayes was bleeding within the first minute & neither Hayes or Garvin wanted to tag into the match when the other was ready to tag out.
AWA WrestleRock '86

Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah The Butcher - Just knowing the violent nature of both men, Fritz Von Erich was the special referee for this match. This was slow paced brawl with both men bleeding & Fritz having to get physically involved to enforce the rules but when one just got in his face one too many times, Fritz took matters into his own hands causing him to not only be the deciding factor in the match but also get into his own brawl after the match.
""WCCW Cotton Bowl Extravaganza"" Oct. '86

Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers - Anyone who knows their AWA history knows that this was a long intense feud & that played out here heavily as both teams started the match brawling to the point where Buddy Rose was bleeding within the first minute with Somers to follow a short time later. The Rockers were very dominate but made it clear that they were more focused on delivering a beating than winning a match to the point where Sherri on the outside was screaming to just stop the match. Rose & Somers had to resort to dirty tactics to gain an advantage & eventually cause Shawn Michaels to bleed. The name of this event perfectly described this match as nobody was safe in the ring nor was Sherri on the outside when a fan decided to take matters into his own hands.
""AWA Brawl In St. Paul"" Dec. '86
[Spectacular Legacy Of AWA]

Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - Andre got the advantage over Hogan early by choking him with his own shirt & even using it to tie Hogan to the cage at one point. Bobby Heenan was at ringside & make it clear to Andre to get out the cage whenever he had a chance as Hogan was eventually bleeding but began to make his comeback to the point where Bobby himself had to get involved to try to help matters out only for him to get what he deserves. The match was pretty short & sweet but nothing special past the historical factor of this being the only cage match (according to the announcers) between Hogan & Andre.
WrestleFest '88

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - They used the ThunderCage that also caged the outside ring area instead of just the ring itself. This match wasn't as good as their previous matches but still solid & enjoyable as it was the booking that made this match worse than what it was. Luger was put in the position to stall Flair until Sting got better from his injury so nobody really expected Luger to walk out with the title. Even when it looked like Luger was actually going to win the title, Ole Anderson had the cage lifted for the Horsemen to attack Luger & get Flair disqualified. That's right, a disqualification for outside interference in a cage match...which defeats the purpose of a cage match. The match itself was as good as any other Luger/Flair match but the booking just makes it look worse in comparison to the others.
NWA Capital Combat '90

WWE Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude - Warrior's first major challenger for his WWE Championship was the only man to have defeated Warrior over a year earlier for the Intercontinental Championship in the Ravishing One. Rude entered the cage first & made it so Warrior would have to fight through Rude just to get in the cage to start the match. This started out as a slugfest as both men were trading punches more than anything else before Rude was able to get an advantage over Warrior. Rude was more focused on just punishing Warrior instead of winning the championship as he had plenty of chances to just walk out of the cage (as Heenan at ringside kept yelling for him to do) before it eventually backfired on him to the point where even Bobby got involved to help Rude out. Anyone who was around to witness Ultimate Warrior knows that he was very limited in what he could do so this was as good as you expected it to be but still entertaining.
SummerSlam '90
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior]

Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - Months before their classic encounter at WrestleMania, they had a forgotten cage match at Madison Square Garden shorty after the Royal Rumble when Savage cost Warrior the WWE Championship. This started as a fight on the floor before moving inside the cage as both men went back & forth against each other. Sherri was at ringside & played a factor multiple times by reaching through the cage & eventually getting in the cage herself before getting the clothes beat her off her...literally. This was a very entertaining match with an aftermath that was just as out of control as the match itself.
""MSG"" Jan. '91

WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty - I believe this was set to be the final encounter in their feud that was going on for months at this point. There was a little bit on confusion in the beginning as the announcers stated that the only way to win this match was escaping the cage but the referee went into the cage early to make a pinfall. Diesel was at ringside & got involved to help Shawn but Marty still kept fighting including ""making an ass"" of Shawn at one point before both men fought on top of the cage with one ended up being tossed off the top. They had a good match but it didn't top or match their ""Match Of The Year"" from months earlier on RAW.
Aug. 93
[Bloodbath: Most Incredible Cage Matches]

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was the the third match in the series between these two and with the previous matches getting so out of control, this one was put inside the steel cage. Hunter tried running away various times to get away with Mankind while Chyna was able to get involved in this match although she was on the outside by reach through the steel bars & later on slamming the cage door into Mankind's face. This was a great match between these two (when did they ever really have a bad one when you think about it) with some big moments like the superplex off the top of the cage & Mankind recreating the one moment that inspired him to become a professional wrestler years earlier.
SummerSlam '97
[Bloodbath: Most Incredible Cage Matches; Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon - To summarize this one is in a nutshell, this is the definition of ""Opening A Can Of Whoop-Ass"" on someone because Austin just beat the hell out of Vince from making him bleed, tossing him into the cage, having him fall off the cage through the announce table...wow, it was amazing to see Vince himself take the type of punishment at that time.
St. Valentine's Day Masscre '99
[McMahon]

WWE Championship Triple H vs. The Rock - Before the match, we got a special treat as The Rock did what he does best & do his thing on the mic. The first half of this match was a normal hard fought wrestling match between the two with the cage being used as a weapon along with both men taking some hard falls off the cage. Things really got turned up when they both ended up escaping the cage & started fighting on the outside with a chair being used & Triple H beginning to bleed. We got an appearance from British Bulldog who went crazy on everyone in sight before others made an appearance in the match as well. Every time Rock & Triple H work together, you get an entertaining quality match & this was no exception.
Rebellion '99

Unification Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Hardy Boys vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz - The Hardys were in their home state here as it started off as a regular match with both teams tagging in their partners before eventually evolving into a brawl with the cage coming into play at times such as Matt's leg being hooked at the top & hanging upside down from the cage. Stacy Keibler had a creative way of getting involved when Bubba called to ""Get The Tables!"" but the bigger story here was the conflict between Matt & Jeff as Matt was focused on winning the match while Jeff's mind was on being his usual daredevil self. I know some people compared this to their TLC matches but this was able to stand out on it's own and it wasn't one of those ""bloody massacre"" cage matches but they don't disappoint anytime they're allowed to go one on one in a tag team match and this is the same as well. As a funny side note, you could tell how confusing it was having so many championships in the company during that time as the production team introduced the Dudleys as the WWE Tag Team Champions when they were the WCW Tag Team Champions.
Survivor Series '01
[Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams]

Edge vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho tried to escape early but was caught by Edge who used the cage to his advantage when Jericho was tied into the ropes by giving him a spear that squished him between Edge & the cage. Jericho later used the cage to his advantage by throwing Edge into the cage causing him to bleed before attempted to deliver the same type of spear to him later on. Both men took some hard bumps here as Edge delivered his Edge-O-Matic from the top rope, Jericho slingshotting Edge into the cage & later delivering one hell of a chairshot to Edge's head, and both men doing moves off the top rope that ended up hurting themselves as much as the other guy. Edge & Jericho never disappoint & this is no exception but stay tuned afterwords as you got a moment from Rey Mysterio that was definitely a highlight reel moment that was used for a long time after it happened.
""SmackDown"" July '02

Chris Jericho vs. Christian - Christian came to ringside with Trish Stratus & Tyson Tomko but you had a pretty good idea where this match was going when Jericho did a flying cross body off the top of the cage onto Christian in the early part of the match. Jericho continued to deliver some hard hits here as he sidestepped Christian who ended up running into the cage head first before grinding it into the cage & later springboard dropkicking Christian's face into the cage causing it to become a ""crimson mask"" before later delivering his double-arm suplex off the top rope. Both Tomko & Trish got involved but Jericho was on a mission of revenge which he accomplished...to the point where Christian suffered a back injury that kept him out of action for several months after this match.
""Raw"" May '04

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair - I believe this was Randy Orton's first televised cage match (outside of the Elimination Chamber) with Lawler being up an interesting fact in that Flair's probably had more steel cage matches in his career at this point than Orton's had matches period. Flair used the cage to bust Orton up early but Orton returned the favor when Flair tried to escape by ramming Flair's head into the steel poles at the top of the cage causing him to heavily bleed. Orton heavily worked over Flair by punching & kicking his head where the cut was & even grinding it up against the cage & dropkicking Flair into the cage as well. This wasn't the classic type of cage match that we've seen from Flair in the past & future (like his match with Triple H a year later) but it did it's job in helping elevate Orton while we got a special ""out of character"" show of respect between both men after the match.
Taboo Tuesday '04

Matt Hardy vs. Edge - This was without a doubt the best match in this feud that was without a doubt one of the top news stories of the year. This was mostly just a brawl between both men with some crazy spots like Edge's powerbomb off the ropes, when the crowd erupted when Edge got tied into ropes, Matt finally getting his hands on Lita, and the highlight reel of Hardy's legrop from the top of the cage before getting the victory.
Unforgiven '05
[Twist Of Fate: The Matt & Jeff Hardy Story]

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Edge - Cena came into this match with an injured arm & Edge heavily focused on that arm with kicks, using the ropes to stretch it out, and various armbars. Cena's arm was hurt to the point where it hurt to do his own offense such as his ""throwback."" At one point Cena tried to escape the cage only using his good arm before Edge yanked him down via his bad arm & applied a variation of the crossface. Cena kept fighting back with one arm delivering a bulldog off the top rope & his belly to belly suplex but Edge kept going after Cena's arm & even threw him into the cage armfirst. A chair got involved with a chairshot being delivered that sounded like a shotgun going off before outside interference played an important factor here. With Cena having a reputation of playing ""superman"" & no-selling, that wasn't the case here as they told a great story revolving around the injured arm.
""Raw"" Oct. '06

World Championship Batista vs. Chris Jericho - Batista won the World Championship a short time earlier at the Cyber Sunday PPV so Jericho got his rematch here. Jericho tried to use his speed here & escape the cage early before being caught by Batista who used his power advantage throughout the match with powerful slams & clotheslines while throwing Jericho into the cage. His power almost worked against him at one point where he powered out of the Walls Of Jericho but almost kicked Jericho out of the cage in the process leaving Jericho the opportunity he needed to slam the door on Batista's legs taking away his power advantage as his leg gave out when trying to do the sidewalk slam. At one point Jericho tried to climb out of the cage but Batista used the cage door to his own advantage to make sure Jericho didn't escape but they once again fought for escape causing Jericho to resort to using whatever he could use his hands on & refocusing on his injured knee to get the advantage he needed to overcome the odds.
""Raw"" Nov. '08

World Championship C.M. Punk vs. Jeff Hardy - The final encounter in their feud as the loser of this match would leave WWE. Jeff Hardy was showing the effects of their T.L.C. match earlier in the week on the way to the ring before he was attacked from behind by Punk...who also had his shoulder taped up from their SummerSlam match. Punk kept constantly trying to escape the cage every quick chance he had early on before Hardy was able to recover & make a comeback. This went back & forth between both men struggling to escape at times such as Punk grabbing on to the steel steps to stop Hardy from pulling him back in, Hardy being ""Spiderman"" like in an attempt to climb over the top while later just dangling on the outside of the cage before being superplexed back in by Punk before just like SummerSlam, they were fighting at the top before Hardy fell & Punk left victorious.

[Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules]

In the end, I liked this DVD set better than the previous Steel Cage Matches one that was released almost a decade ago as we got some rare treats here from WWE's vault with then all being unedited & uncensored. There are some DVD repeats on here but most of them were either so under the radar or so old that I didn't mind them being on this set with the exception of the Triple H/Mankind cage match being the third time it was released along with the fact that it was on the previous Cage Matches DVD so it wasn't needed on here knowing the heavy amount of quality steel cage matches that still haven't been released (none from ECW?). Overall I was pleased with the performance here & it's something I would recommend to add to the collection.",1403568000,,18796,4.455681487939552
4460351,5,B004RBC5RO,I loved the matches on it. I like when they showed to first steel cage match. I would recommend it to any wwe fan.,1388880000,,114,3.7916666666666665
4460352,4,B004RBC5RO,"Let me start out by saying that I am so glad the WWE released this set uncensored what with the whole PG thing they're doing now and all.  This is a good set with some really good choices on here, some that have been released before on DVD and some that have not.  I do somewhat wish that they would have branched out and showed some Hell in a Cell matches, Thunderdome/Thundercage and War Games matches.  Still though a good set from top to bottom.  The first match is a WWE title match between Bob Backlund and Pat Patterson in MSG in 1979.  It is a very good match with some interesting work on the top rop and on top of the cage.  The match is bloody and somewhat short compared to those of today.  You have remember that back then the cage match was billed as the most brutal of all matches and therefore if it was so brutal then why would it last over 30 minutes?  Still a great way to start.  I loved the next match which is also a WWE title match from MSG, this time in 1980 between Bob Backlund and Jimmy Snuka.  This is a brutal and bloody match and just perfect for this set.  Anytime I see Snuka in a cage I think yeah this is the way it should be just because the match is supposed to be brutal and Snuka was always billed in those days as a brutal islander.  Great match!  Up next is the Bruno Sammartino vs. Larry Zbyszko match from Shea Stadium in 1980.  This match won match of the year for that year but when you watch it you might just ask why?  I think it's just a subpar match honestly, not really brutal at all even though Bruno should be pissed as Larry is the one who tried to take him out of the business.  There's a lot of stomping and some cage work but really just a subpar match.  Next is a classic between Ric Flair and Kerry Von Erich for the NWA world title at WCCW Star Wars on Christmas night in 1982.  This is a killer match that took place during Flair's first reign.  I have always felt that Kerry was one of Flair's best opponents and anytime I can see them wrestle then I am there.  This one is bloody and some very good wrestling.  There were some moments where I though Kerry was going to win the thing.  Sadly, he'd have to wait two years later to do that.  Check this match out though.  Up next we get Ivan and Nikita Koloff vs Rock n Roll Express at Starrcade 1985 for the NWA tag titles.  One thing i got to say is that if the RNR Express is in a cage then you can expect one thing:  Ricky Morton will bleed!  And, guess what?  He did!  All joking aside though, this is a very good match from start to finish.  I've always felt the Express was underrated as tag teams go but this was just a very good contest.  Up next is the Road Warriors vs the Freebirds from AWA Wrestlerock 1986.  This is an ok match.  Nothing really good going on here, just ok.  Then we get Abdullah the Butcher vs Bruiser Brody from the Cotton Bowl Extravanganza in 1986.  I hate both these buys so to me this match sucks!  Other people worship these guys but really all Abdullah could do in a ring was bleed and use forks and stuff.  Bruiser was just a bully in real life and not that good in the ring so not sure why this one is on here.  Next we get the Midnight Rockers vs Doug Somers and Buddy Rose from the Brawl in Saint Paul in 1986 for AWA tag titles.  This was a fast paced and bloody cage match that was definatly better then the previous 2 matches I mentioned.  This, to me, was not their best matche together but still a good one.  Lastly, from disc 1, we get a rare match from Wrestlefest 1988 with Hulk Hogan taking on Andre the Giant.  I think this one happened right after Wrestlemania 4.  This match was short but very memorable as Andre the Giant actually tried to scale the cage to escape and win the match!!  I think it was Gorilla Monsoon who said it best by saying that he looked liked King Kong trying to scale the Empire State Building and he was right.  I remember watching this as a kid and thinking oh my god he's going to topple the whole wall of the cage and hurt himself.  He didn't though and the match ended the way everyone thought it would with Hogan winning.  Great match!  Disc 2 starts with a killer match between Ric Flair and Lex Luger for the NWA world title at Capital Combat 1990.  The cage used in this one was like the Thundercage and surrounded the ringside area.  Very good match as most of their matches are.  Very bloody as well.  The one thing I don't get is why Luger is so angry at the beginning of the match.  You can tell on the way out as he talks to camera men and pushes them out of the way and even before the match begins he's still stewing about something.  Put that aside and you get a very good wrestling match.  And, yes, this PPV was known for having Robocop show up.  Next we get a WWE title match with the Ultimate Warrior and Rick Rude going at it at Summerslam 1990.  Short match but good mainly because of Rude who was one of the few people that could give Warrior a match.  Some blood but not a lot and some really insane moves by Rude is what makes this one.  Up next is kind of a rare find with Warrior going up against Macho Man at MSG in 1991.  Good match but could have been a little bit better.  Macho is always good but had a little bit of trouble pulling a good one out of ol Warrior here.  Pretty good.  The next one is a match between former friends and tag partners as Shawn Michaels battles Marty Jannetty in 1993 for the Intercontinental title.  This match would have been better but Shawn was going through what I like to call his ""fat years"" at this time and that really hindered the match.  Still most fans were ok with the match because it was another chance for them to see the Rockers go at it to see who was the best.  The next one is when Triple H took on Mankind at Summerslam 1997 in the cage.  Great match and honestly these two had a great feud in 1997.  This is a very good match even though there was no blood.  There were a lot of sick spots and Chyna really does some cool stuff as well.  This is where we get to see Dude Love emerge for the first time as Mick kind of conjures memories of the past by doing the Superfly leap onto Triple H, but other than that the match is really exciting to watch.  Vince McMahon vs Steve Austin from Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is next and I really love this match.  I mean we get to first of all see Vince in a cage, then we get to see him fly off it and onto the announce table, then we get to see him bleed and then we get to see the Big Show make his debut and through Austin through the cage, literally.  This is a great match!  Finally off disc 2 we get kind of another rare match with Rock and Triple H going at it for the WWE title at Rebellion 1999 in England.  Great match as most of their matches were.  There was some blood and very good ending to this one.  This match is well worth seeing.  Disc 3 begins with the WCW and WWE unified tag title match between the Dudley Boys and the Hardy Boyz at Survivor Series 2001.  Really good match with the Hardy's pulling out all the stops.  The ending is kind of dumb but it does make sense because this is where we get to see some dissention in the ranks of the Hardy Boyz.  The next two matches are from Raw:  The first one is Edge vs Chris Jericho which is a very good match.  There's a lot of good spots and a pretty fast paced match as well.  The second one is Chris Jericho vs Christian which is also good.  It's kind of like watching the previous match but it's still fun to see.  Up next is a classic with Randy Orton taking on Ric Flair at Taboo Tuesday 2004.  This is a very bloody match but also very good.  This to me is the match that really brought Orton to the big time.  I mean yes he had won the world and IC titles before this match but at the end of this one he got Flair's respect and that I think actually made a bigger impression with the fans.  Up next is Matt Hardy vs Edge from Unforgiven 2005.  This is a good match due to the fact that it was personal with the whole triangle love story that happened outside the ring in this one.  Good match.  The Edge/Cena match from Raw 2006 was next and it sucked just like all their matches have.  The next one we get is Batista vs Chris Jericho from Raw in 2008.  This is another just ok match with the only really good that happened is that Jericho won the world heavyweight title that night.  Lastly, we get CM Punk against Jeff Hardy for the world heavyweight title on Smackdown.  Awesome match that was also Jeff's last match in the WWE (so far).  A lot of good spots and there were moments where you thought maybe just maybe this is it and Jeff's gonna do it but alas he did not and now he's in TNA land.  Pretty good set I have to say.  I do wish there were some matches on this one that was not included but still this set is worth owning.",1323993600,2,8825,4.073255813953488

4460359,4,B004RBC5RO,"Its been known as a battle ground to settle scores, the proving ground where men become heroes and the final showdown in a long standing rivalry. It is the steel cage match and this 3-Disc set showcases some of the greatest, most violent cage matches of all time.

Disc 1

We begin with a brief video package showing various clips of steel cgae matches throughout the years, which is a pretty cool but has an obvious ominious tone to it.

Josh Matthews welcomes us and talks about how the steel cage match was introduced and added a new element to matches and provided a way to end a rivalry once and for all.

-9/24/79, MSG, WWE Championship Match: Bob Backlund (Champion) vs. Pat Patteron (Intercontinental Champion): This is a good early one here as Patterson was looking to become a duel champion and he almost succeeded on several occasions. Backlund was much more aggressive than usual as he bashed Patterson's head into the cage on numerous occasions.  Patterson at one point even busts open Backlund by bashing him in the head with part of the turnbuckle and then he just continues to pound away at Backlund's head. Blacklund manages to escape out the door to retain his title. 7/10. While tame when compared to later cage matches this was a pretty heated exchange that really showcased both men very well.

-5/19/80, MSG, WWE Championship Match: Bob Backlund (Champion) vs. ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka: Due to Snuka's leaping ability, the special stipulation here is the only way to win this one is to go through the door. Backlund take it to Snuka early on beating him down, before Snuka comes back chopping and head butting the champion. Backlund stops Snuka from escaping on a few occasions then launches him into the cage busting the superfly open. Snuka does his famous splash from the top of the cage but misses and Backlund escapes to retain. 9/10. Much better than the previous match.

(Also Available on Legends of Wrestling: Hulk Hogan & Bob Backlund)

-8/9/80, Shea Stadium: Larry Zbyszko vs. Bruno Sammartino: We get alternate commentary from Josh Matthews and Matt Striker here. This rivalry was intense and this match was no different, as it was student vs. teacher. Bruno takes it to Larry early on throwing him into the cage quite a few times. Larry does come back taking the fight to Bruno even working on Bruno's shoulder with punches and knees in the corner. Bruno busted shoulder and all walks out of the cage for the win. 8/10.

-12/25/82, WCCW Christmas Star Wars, NWA Championship Match, Special Referee: Michael P.S. Hayes: Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Kerry Von Erich: On a side note, seems like the entrance wasn't very well thought out as the wrestlers namely Kerry get kinda mauled by the fans on the way to the ring. Hayes gets physically involved quite a bit for a referee, getting in the face of both men numerous times. Flair makes Kerry look like a million bucks, while getting in his usual wear down offense. Terry Gordy slams the cage door into Kerry's head and Hayes turns on Kerry counting him down, even though his shoulder was up. The Freebirds leave the ring and Flair continues to pound on Kerry. The referree calls for the bell when Kerry couldn't continue. 9/10.

-11/28/85, Starrcade '85, NWA Tag Team Championship Match: Rock N' Roll Express vs. Nikita and Ivan Koloff (Champions): Nikita uses his power very well, while the Express use plenty of good sound tag team wrestling and double team moves. Both Robert Gibson and Ivan bleed quite a bit and the Koloffs keep cutting off the ring and wear down Gibson. The tag is made and Ricky Morton quickly rolls up Ivan for the 3 count and we have new tag team champions. 7/10. Nice post match where the russians beat up Gibson and fight their way out of the cage to a chorus of boos.

-4/20/86, AWA Wrestlerock: Road Warriors vs. Michael P.S. Hayes and ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin: Hayes hits a piledriver on Hawk early, but Hawk comes back slamming Hayes to the cage and the mat and Hayes is busted open. Garvin is reluctant to accept the tag and he too gets thrown around by Hawk and then by Animal. Both Hayes and Garvin get in some shots, Hayes even locks on the figure four on Hawk, but this is mainly domination by the Road Warriors. Hayes accidentaly hits Garvin with some brass knuckles and Animal makes the cover for the 3. 7/10.

-10/12/86, WCCW Cotton Bowl Extravanganza: Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah The Butcher, Special Referee Fritz Von Erich: With these two a cage is the only place where they would feel at home. While most cage matches aren't technical masterpieces this is the very definition of a slugfest. Abdullah brings out the trademark fork and uses it on both Fritz and Brody, Fritz returns the favor to Abdullah and Brody makes the cover for the win. 5/10. The post match segment is nice as Fritz uses the fork on Abdullah and even his manager Gary Hart.

-12/25/86, AWA Brawl In St. Paul, AWA Tag Team Championship Match: Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose and Doug Summers: Both Jannetty and Michaels take it to Rose and Summers from the get go, busting open both men. Despite some offense from Rose and Summers, The Rockers mainly dominate the first half of this match. There's a good amount of blood in this match especially from Shawn. At one point some fan comes to ringside and throws a drink on Sherri Martel drenching her. Marty hits a top rope splash for the win as the Rockers become the new tag team champions. 7/10. Summers and Rose beat down Marty post match before Shawn makes the save.

-7/31/88, WWE Wrestlefest: Andre The Giant vs. Hulk Hogan: Playing off their famous Wrestlemania III match, this rivalry continues in the cage, which does help mask the fact that Andre was clearly on the downside of his career and Hogan as entertaining as he was, was no doubt limited in the ring. Hogan does his best to prevent Andre from escaping, even using a sleeper hold to wear him down. Andre drives Hogan's head into the exposed turnbuckle busting him open and beats him down with punches and slams into the cage. Bobby Heenan interferes and gets thrown into the cage. Andre is tied up in the ropes and Hogan climbs over the top to the floor for the win. 6/10.

Disc 2

-5/19/90, WCW Capital Combat, WCW Heavyweight Championship Match: Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Lex Luger (U.S. Champion): The wrestler of the 80's in Flair vs. what was hyped as the wrestler of the 90's in Luger. I've personally never been a fan of Lex, I just feel he coasted too often in his matches and was never a great worker. Apparently in the weeks prior to this match he had a massive staph infection in his knee and had a high fever which if true it was amazing he even bothered to work this match. Flair does make Luger look good in this match though, and Luger does use his obvious power edge to his advantage. Flair does bleed quite a bit, but does take advantage of Luger's bad knee setting it up for the figure four. Luger had Flair in the Torture Rack but Barry Windham interferes, causing a DQ which is unusual for a cage match. 8/10.

-8/27/90, Summerslam, WWE Championship Match: Rick Rude vs. Ultimate Warrior (Champion): Besides Randy Savage I always felt Rick Rude was his best rival, Rude just had the charisma and ability to help mask the Warriors lack of in ring ability. Both men bleed here and Rude gives it his best shot, even has Warrior beat one a few occasions but the Warrior proves too much. Warrior hits the press slam and climbs out of the cage to retain his title. 8/10.

(Also Available on The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior & Summerslam Anthology Volume I)

-1/24/91, MSG: Macho King Randy Savage vs. Ultimate Warrior: This was the night after Savage cost Warrior the title at the Royal Rumble and Warrior took it to Savage early on the outside. After being dominated for the early portion of the match, Savage targets Warriors head that Savage smashed his scepter into the previous night. Warrior makes is comeback, Sherri interferes and Savage drops down to win the match. 7/10. Nice post match with Warrior basically disrobing Sherri, Savage comes down the from top of the cage but Warrior counters and beats down Savage.

-8/17/93, White Plains, NY. I.C. Title Match: Shawn Michaels (Champion) vs. Marty Jannetty: After a year plus and a few matches but nothing really settled we have a face off between the two former Rockers. These two always worked well together, too bad Marty couldn't control his demons and issues long enough to keep a good set of matches going. Both men do go all out and Shawn tries wearing down Marty, as both battle on top of the cage Marty throws Shawn off the top into the ring. As Diesel and Marty fight on one side Shawn escapes through the door to retain his title. 7/10.

-8/3/97, Summerslam: Triple H vs. Mankind: Pretty brutal one here, both men take shots against the steel, Chyna makes her presense felt as she tries to help Triple H win the match. Triple H hits the superplex from the top of the cage, Mankind suplex Triple H into the cage hanging him feet first from the top of the cage and hits a running double axe handle. Mankind is about to win when he goes back up to the top of the cage hitting a huge diving elbow onto Triple H. Mankind wins by dropping down to the floor moments before Chyna pulled Triple H through the door. Post match stuff with Mankind going to his Dude Love persona as he exited the ring side area. 8/10.

(Also Available on Greatest Stars of the '90's & Summerslam Anthology Volume II)

-2/14/99, St. Valentine's Day Massacre: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon: This was a long time coming and Austin's title shot at Wrestlemania was on the line here. After some stalling on the outside by Vince, it was basically domination by Austin as every time he went to escape Vince would antagonize him enough to make him come back. Vince does take a nasty bump off the cage through the announce table, though Vince clearly hurt his tailbone when he didn't quite make the table. Paul Wight (aka Big Show) makes his debut and throws Austin into the cage wall, which gives way and Austin drops to the floor to keep his shot at Wrestlemania. 9/10.

(Available on McMahon)

-10/2/99, Rebellion, WWE Championship Match: Triple H (Champion) vs. The Rock: This is from a U.K. PPV they did and these two rarely had a bad match and this is no exception. There's a good classic Rock promo before where he runs down Triple H and even brings a fan into it. After some early brawling between both men, Triple H slams Rock into the cage a few times. Both men make good use of the cage and just wear each other down. Rock escapes but the ref is down and the action spills into the crowd, Triple H gets busted open from a chair. Rock almost wins but the British Bulldog interferes, Chyna then slams the door into Rock's head. Bulldog pulls the Rock into the ring and Triple H drops down to the floor to retain his title. 9/10.

Disc 3

-11/18/01, Survivor Series, Tag Team Championship Unification Match: The Dudley Boyz (WCW Tag Team Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz (WWE Tag Team Champions): Both these teams know each other very well having competed in table and TLC matches, but this was their first ever meeting inside the steel cage. Both teams go all out here and Matt does end up escaping and Jeff goes to the top to escape but decides to do a swanton onto D'Von through a table but misses. Buh Buh Ray pins Jeff to win the match. 8/10.

-7/25/02, Smackdown: Edge vs. Chris Jericho: Edge was coming off of having a shoulder injury he suffered a couple of months before and Edge takes it early on to Jericho trying to get revenge.  Jericho does come back targeting Edge's shoulder and raking his head along the cage. There's some great back and forth action, with Jericho even kicking out of Edge's spear then Jericho hits a huge bulldog from the top rope. Edge hits a huge electric chair drop from the top rope. Edge ends up dropping down to the floor just before Jericho escapes out the door to win. 8/10. Nice post match with Test (R.I.P.), Christian and Lance Storm attacking Edge, John Cena comes in for the save, then Rey Mysterio climbs up the cage and hits a huge dive off the top onto Storm and Christian.

-5/10/04, Raw: Chris Jericho vs. Christian: This match is playing off their Wrestlemania XX encounter that saw Trish turn heel on Jericho and join Christian. These two know each other very well and it shows as the action keeps going back and forth between both men. Jericho does hit a nice crossbody from the top of the cage. After Tyson Tomko gets sent to the back the action continues and Christian gets busted open badly. Jericho gets Christian in the Walls of Jericho and Christian tries escaping but gets dragged back in and taps out, Jericho wins. 8/10.

-10/19/04, Taboo Tuesday: Ric Flair vs. Randy Orton: We get to see the former Evolution member in Orton vs. current member Flair and its a good contest as Flair really helps establish Orton even more as a major league player in wrestling. Orton gets busted open early and Flair continues to chop and slam Orton into the cage. Randy comes back busting Flair open against the cage. Flair tries to use a chair but Orton hits a sudden RKO for the win, in what was a bit of a short match. 8/10.

-9/18/05, Unforgiven: Edge vs. Matt Hardy: This was playing off the real life tension between these two and Lita as Edge and Lita got involved with each other while Lita was still dating Matt. Even though I'm sure there was plenty of actual frustration and anger both men had for each other, this was a good, solid encounter that told a great story. The punches and other moves seem a lot stiffer than in a normal match. Edge bleeds quite a bit, Lita tries interfering but pays for it. Matt gets a measure of revenge hitting an absolutely sick leg drop on Edge from the top of the cage and makes the pin to win the match. 10/10.

-10/2/06, Raw, WWE Championship Match: John Cena (Champion) vs. Edge: Easily one of Cena's top 3 rivalries in his career came in '06 in the form of Edge. In this match Edge targeted Cena's bad arm while Cena did his usual limited number of moves to inflict damage on Edge. Very few could bring the best out of Cena and Edge was one of those that could as he made him look a lot better in the ring than he really is. Cena does hit a nice bulldog like move from the top rope. Lita gets ejected but not before bringing a steel chair into the ring to help Edge but it backfires as Cena wacks Edge over the head but the referee is down. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch enter the cage and help Edge try to escape. DX come in and fight of Cade & Murdoch, the door gets slammed into Edge's head, Cena hits the FU for the win to retain his title. 9/10.

-11/3/08, Raw, World Heavyweight Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs. Batista (Champion): This was Jericho's rematch for the title after he lost it at Cyber Sunday, since Batista obviously was the stronger of the two so Jericho had to outquick the animal. This was a good encounter that saw Jericho use part of the cage cable and escaped over the top and dropped down to win the World Title. 7/10.

-8/28/09, Smackdown, World Heavyweight Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: Besides the title this was also a Loser Leaves WWE Match, so Punk jumped Hardy during his entrance to gain the early advantage. Both men showed the effects of the TLC match they had 5 days earlier at Summerslam but still pulled off some high impact moves. There was a nasty superplex by Punk from the top of the cage. Hardy does almost win a few times, but in the end Punk kicks Hardy off the top of the cage and drops to the floor to retain the title and thus Jeff Hardy is gone from WWE. 9/10. Side note: Good thing too cause that idiot Hardy got busted for massive drug possession in his home a few weeks later. Punk was right to call him out on it during this storyline like he did, even accurately calling him ""The Charismatic Enabler"".

There were a few omissions a couple for obvious reasons. I would've loved to see the classi Raw encounter between Angle and Benoit but no someone had to abuse drugs, take too many head shots and go haywire a few years back. Not to name names of course. This was a very good collection of matches, not a ton of repeats, cept the Mankind/Triple H match while good, couldve been replaced by oh say the Magnum T.A./Tully Blanchard I Quit Match from Starrcade '85, or even the Bret/Owen match from Summerslam '94.

4460360,4,B004RBC5RO,"WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. Pat Patterson - Pat went straight after Bob as soon as he got in the cage with both men stopping each other from escaping various times.  Both had various moments fighting on top of the cage with both eventually bleeding as the match progressed.  This was a good brutal match for it's time with Vince perfectly described the match on commentary, ""Not designed to be scientific, it's no holds barred.""
""MSG"" Sept. '79

WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. Jimmy Snuka - A lost gem here as this was back when Jimmy Snuka was a heel & managed by Capt. Lou Albano with the special stipulation that you could only win by leaving through the cage door.  This match started off slow with both men wrestling each other before Backlund turned it up & started ramming Snuka into the cage causing him to bleed to the point where Backlund had it on his leg & fist. This match is most memorable for Snuka jumping off the top of the cage...and missing which would be overshadowed later by when it jumped off the cage & landed onto Don Muraco.

Bruno Sammartino vs. Larry Zbyszko - Josh Matthews & Matt Striker did the commentary on this match as it was ""Student vs. Teacher"" between these two.  Matt Striker said it on commentary that this was a ""knock down, drag out fight"" as both men were using the cage as a weapon various times along with just fighting with stomps & chokes & punches.  Bruno hurt his shoulder at one point allowing Larry to work over it & even causing it to bleed taking away Bruno's power advantage while Bruno retaliated by being able to bust Larry's head open using the cage.  Good historic match here.
""Showdown At Shea"" Aug. '80

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Kerry Von Erich - Freebird Michael Hayes was a special referee here while his fellow Freebird partner Terry Gordy was guarding the cage door to ensure that it was going to be a fair fight between Kerry & Flair.  Both men traded momentum back & forth with each man having the same strategy of working on each others legs with Kerry also causing Flair to bleed.  Michael Hayes at times got very physical with both wrestlers just to enforce the rules to the point where he was arguing with the regular referee when he kept telling him to back off but when Flair pushed him one time too many, Hayes just went off & tried to help Kerry win the match but lead to a complete misunderstanding to the point where it started one of the most infamous rivalries in wrestling history.

NWA Tag Team Champion Ivan & Nikita Koloff vs. Rock `N Roll Express - The Koloff's had Krusher Kruschev in their corner on the outside of the cage while the Express had Don Kernodle in theirs.  R&R used their speed to their advantage early by constantly making quick tags to keep a fresh man in while isolating Ivan Koloff to the point where he was bleeding.  Nikita finally broke their momentum & worked over Gibson to the point where he was bleeding too building up to the hot tag.  This was classic tag team wrestling but keep watching afterwords as the Koloff's showed why they were so dangerous by attacking everyone in sight.
NWA Starrcade '85

Road Warriors vs. Michael Hayes & Jimmy Garvin - The Warriors were out for revenge for losing their AWA Tag Team Titles & this was just a powerful dominate performance from the Warriors to the point where Michael Hayes was bleeding within the first minute & neither Hayes or Garvin wanted to tag into the match when the other was ready to tag out.
AWA WrestleRock '86

Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah The Butcher - Just knowing the violent nature of both men, Fritz Von Erich was the special referee for this match.  This was slow paced brawl with both men bleeding & Fritz having to get physically involved to enforce the rules but when one just got in his face one too many times, Fritz took matters into his own hands causing him to not only be the deciding factor in the match but also get into his own brawl after the match.
""WCCW Cotton Bowl Extravaganza"" Oct. '86

Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers - Anyone who knows their AWA history knows that this was a long intense feud & that played out here heavily as both teams started the match brawling to the point where Buddy Rose was bleeding within the first minute with Somers to follow a short time later.  The Rockers were very dominate but made it clear that they were more focused on delivering a beating than winning a match to the point where Sherri on the outside was screaming to just stop the match.  Rose & Somers had to resort to dirty tactics to gain an advantage & eventually cause Shawn Michaels to bleed.  The name of this event perfectly described this match as nobody was safe in the ring nor was Sherri on the outside when a fan decided to take matters into his own hands.
""AWA Brawl In St. Paul"" Dec. '86
[Spectacular Legacy Of AWA]

Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - Andre got the advantage over Hogan early by choking him with his own shirt & even using it to tie Hogan to the cage at one point.  Bobby Heenan was at ringside & make it clear to Andre to get out the cage whenever he had a chance as Hogan was eventually bleeding but began to make his comeback to the point where Bobby himself had to get involved to try to help matters out only for him to get what he deserves.  The match was pretty short & sweet but nothing special past the historical factor of this being the only cage match (according to the announcers) between Hogan & Andre.
WrestleFest '88

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - They used the ThunderCage that also caged the outside ring area instead of just the ring itself. This match wasn't as good as their previous matches but still solid & enjoyable as it was the booking that made this match worse than what it was. Luger was put in the position to stall Flair until Sting got better from his injury so nobody really expected Luger to walk out with the title. Even when it looked like Luger was actually going to win the title, Ole Anderson had the cage lifted for the Horsemen to attack Luger & get Flair disqualified. That's right, a disqualification for outside interference in a cage match...which defeats the purpose of a cage match. The match itself was as good as any other Luger/Flair match but the booking just makes it look worse in comparison to the others.
NWA Capital Combat '90

WWE Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude - Warrior's first major challenger for his WWE Championship was the only man to have defeated Warrior over a year earlier for the Intercontinental Championship in the Ravishing One.  Rude entered the cage first & made it so Warrior would have to fight through Rude just to get in the cage to start the match.  This started out as a slugfest as both men were trading punches more than anything else before Rude was able to get an advantage over Warrior.  Rude was more focused on just punishing Warrior instead of winning the championship as he had plenty of chances to just walk out of the cage (as Heenan at ringside kept yelling for him to do) before it eventually backfired on him to the point where even Bobby got involved to help Rude out.  Anyone who was around to witness Ultimate Warrior knows that he was very limited in what he could do so this was as good as you expected it to be but still entertaining.
SummerSlam '90
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior]

Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - Months before their classic encounter at WrestleMania, they had a forgotten cage match at Madison Square Garden shorty after the Royal Rumble when Savage cost Warrior the WWE Championship.  This started as a fight on the floor before moving inside the cage as both men went back & forth against each other.  Sherri was at ringside & played a factor multiple times by reaching through the cage & eventually getting in the cage herself before getting the clothes beat her off her...literally.  This was a very entertaining match with an aftermath that was just as out of control as the match itself.
""MSG"" Jan. '91

WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty - I believe this was set to be the final encounter in their feud that was going on for months at this point.  There was a little bit on confusion in the beginning as the announcers stated that the only way to win this match was escaping the cage but the referee went into the cage early to make a pinfall.  Diesel was at ringside & got involved to help Shawn but Marty still kept fighting including ""making an ass"" of Shawn at one point before both men fought on top of the cage with one ended up being tossed off the top.  They had a good match but it didn't top or match their ""Match Of The Year"" from months earlier on RAW.

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was the the third match in the series between these two and with the previous matches getting so out of control, this one was put inside the steel cage. Hunter tried running away various times to get away with Mankind while Chyna was able to get involved in this match although she was on the outside by reach through the steel bars & later on slamming the cage door into Mankind's face. This was a great match between these two (when did they ever really have a bad one when you think about it) with some big moments like the superplex off the top of the cage & Mankind recreating the one moment that inspired him to become a professional wrestler years earlier.

Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon - To summarize this one is in a nutshell, this is the definition of ""Opening A Can Of Whoop-Ass"" on someone because Austin just beat the hell out of Vince from making him bleed, tossing him into the cage, having him fall off the cage through the announce table...wow, it was amazing to see Vince himself take the type of punishment at that time.
St. Valentine's Day Masscre '99

WWE Championship Triple H vs. The Rock - Before the match, we got a special treat as The Rock did what he does best & do his thing on the mic.  The first half of this match was a normal hard fought wrestling match between the two with the cage being used as a weapon along with both men taking some hard falls off the cage.  Things really got turned up when they both ended up escaping the cage & started fighting on the outside with a chair being used & Triple H beginning to bleed.  We got an appearance from British Bulldog who went crazy on everyone in sight before others made an appearance in the match as well.  Every time Rock & Triple H work together, you get an entertaining quality match & this was no exception.
Rebellion '99

Unification Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Hardy Boys vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz - The Hardys were in their home state here as it started off as a regular match with both teams tagging in their partners before eventually evolving into a brawl with the cage coming into play at times such as Matt's leg being hooked at the top & hanging upside down from the cage.  Stacy Keibler had a creative way of getting involved when Bubba called to ""Get The Tables!"" but the bigger story here was the conflict between Matt & Jeff as Matt was focused on winning the match while Jeff's mind was on being his usual daredevil self.  I know some people compared this to their TLC matches but this was able to stand out on it's own and it wasn't one of those ""bloody massacre"" cage matches but they don't disappoint anytime they're allowed to go one on one in a tag team match and this is the same as well. As a funny side note, you could tell how confusing it was having so many championships in the company during that time as the production team introduced the Dudleys as the WWE Tag Team Champions when they were the WCW Tag Team Champions.

Edge vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho tried to escape early but was caught by Edge who used the cage to his advantage when Jericho was tied into the ropes by giving him a spear that squished him between Edge & the cage.  Jericho later used the cage to his advantage by throwing Edge into the cage causing him to bleed before attempted to deliver the same type of spear to him later on.  Both men took some hard bumps here as Edge delivered his Edge-O-Matic from the top rope, Jericho slingshotting Edge into the cage & later delivering one hell of a chairshot to Edge's head, and both men doing moves off the top rope that ended up hurting themselves as much as the other guy.  Edge & Jericho never disappoint & this is no exception but stay tuned afterwords as you got a moment from Rey Mysterio that was definitely a highlight reel moment that was used for a long time after it happened.
""SmackDown"" July '02

Chris Jericho vs. Christian - Christian came to ringside with Trish Stratus & Tyson Tomko but you had a pretty good idea where this match was going when Jericho did a flying cross body off the top of the cage onto Christian in the early part of the match.  Jericho continued to deliver some hard hits here as he sidestepped Christian who ended up running into the cage head first before grinding it into the cage & later springboard dropkicking Christian's face into the cage causing it to become a ""crimson mask"" before later delivering his double-arm suplex off the top rope.  Both Tomko & Trish got involved but Jericho was on a mission of revenge which he accomplished...to the point where Christian suffered a back injury that kept him out of action for several months after this match.
""Raw"" May '04

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair - I believe this was Randy Orton's first televised cage match (outside of the Elimination Chamber) with Lawler being up an interesting fact in that Flair's probably had more steel cage matches in his career at this point than Orton's had matches period.  Flair used the cage to bust Orton up early but Orton returned the favor when Flair tried to escape by ramming Flair's head into the steel poles at the top of the cage causing him to heavily bleed.  Orton heavily worked over Flair by punching & kicking his head where the cut was & even grinding it up against the cage & dropkicking Flair into the cage as well.  This wasn't the classic type of cage match that we've seen from Flair in the past & future (like his match with Triple H a year later) but it did it's job in helping elevate Orton while we got a special ""out of character"" show of respect between both men after the match.
Taboo Tuesday '04

Matt Hardy vs. Edge - This was without a doubt the best match in this feud that was without a doubt one of the top news stories of the year. This was mostly just a brawl between both men with some crazy spots like Edge's powerbomb off the ropes, when the crowd erupted when Edge got tied into ropes, Matt finally getting his hands on Lita, and the highlight reel of Hardy's legrop from the top of the cage before getting the victory.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Edge - Cena came into this match with an injured arm & Edge heavily focused on that arm with kicks, using the ropes to stretch it out, and various armbars.  Cena's arm was hurt to the point where it hurt to do his own offense such as his ""throwback.""  At one point Cena tried to escape the cage only using his good arm before Edge yanked him down via his bad arm & applied a variation of the crossface.  Cena kept fighting back with one arm delivering a bulldog off the top rope & his belly to belly suplex but Edge kept going after Cena's arm & even threw him into the cage armfirst.  A chair got involved with a chairshot being delivered that sounded like a shotgun going off before outside interference played an important factor here.  With Cena having a reputation of playing ""superman"" & no-selling, that wasn't the case here as they told a great story revolving around the injured arm.
""Raw"" Oct. '06

World Championship Batista vs. Chris Jericho - Batista won the World Championship a short time earlier at the Cyber Sunday PPV so Jericho got his rematch here.  Jericho tried to use his speed here & escape the cage early before being caught by Batista who used his power advantage throughout the match with powerful slams & clotheslines while throwing Jericho into the cage.  His power almost worked against him at one point where he powered out of the Walls Of Jericho but almost kicked Jericho out of the cage in the process leaving Jericho the opportunity he needed to slam the door on Batista's legs taking away his power advantage as his leg gave out when trying to do the sidewalk slam.  At one point Jericho tried to climb out of the cage but Batista used the cage door to his own advantage to make sure Jericho didn't escape but they once again fought for escape causing Jericho to resort to using whatever he could use his hands on & refocusing on his injured knee to get the advantage he needed to overcome the odds.

World Championship C.M. Punk vs. Jeff Hardy - The final encounter in their feud as the loser of this match would leave WWE. Jeff Hardy was showing the effects of their T.L.C. match earlier in the week on the way to the ring before he was attacked from behind by Punk...who also had his shoulder taped up from their SummerSlam match. Punk kept constantly trying to escape the cage every quick chance he had early on before Hardy was able to recover & make a comeback. This went back & forth between both men struggling to escape at times such as Punk grabbing on to the steel steps to stop Hardy from pulling him back in, Hardy being ""Spiderman"" like in an attempt to climb over the top while later just dangling on the outside of the cage before being superplexed back in by Punk before just like SummerSlam, they were fighting at the top before Hardy fell & Punk left victorious.

In the end, I liked this DVD set better than the previous Steel Cage Matches one that was released almost a decade ago as we got some rare treats here from WWE's vault with then all being unedited & uncensored.  There are some DVD repeats on here but most of them were either so under the radar or so old that I didn't mind them being on this set with the exception of the Triple H/Mankind cage match being the third time it was released along with the fact that it was on the previous Cage Matches DVD so it wasn't needed on here knowing the heavy amount of quality steel cage matches that still haven't been released (none from ECW?).

4460362,3,B004RBC5RO,"I'm at odds with this latest WWE cage match DVD collection. It had the potential to be something special, but overall it's severely lacking. The first disc is clearly the best of the three. With vintage footage from the WWF, NWA, AWA and World Class, it provides a good overview of what cage matches were like back then. Not all the matches are classic and the Bruiser Brody- Abdullah the Butcher battle is a letdown, but it's good to see Flair-Von Erich, R'n'R Express-Koloffs, Backlund-Patterson etc Obviously there's a million great 80's cage matches missing, but you can't have it all. Just seeing blood again in a WWE DVD is satisfying in itself after the recent watered down collections. However this collection really goes downhill with DVD's 2 and 3, when aside from Luger-Flair, it becomes an exclusive WWE cage match affair. Some of these matches are decent, but the question has to be asked: where are the WCW and ECW cage matches from this period? I know there has to be some brutal ECW cage matches that haven't made it to disc yet. The capacity for the WCW to just disappear after 1990 is ridiculous. Therefore it's all WWE, with some hits and misses. There has to be better choices than HHH-Mankind. The span from 1993 to 1997 is totally ignored, even the Owen and Bret Hart classic. I don't know, it just seems like the emphasis should have been on the 80's more, as that truly was the era of the classic cage match. Overall this is worth picking up, but those weaned on NWA and the like will be left disillusioned. Taken for what it is, this is still adequate and again it's nice to see the WWE releasing a product with blood and brutality, which has been so lacking since the no blood policy that will not go away. There is maybe a little too much of Edge and Chris Jericho on the final DVD. Including three matches of them each was a little redundant, so beware.",1309219200,13,1881,4.519061583577713
4460363,2,B004RBC5RO,"I cant believe that another DVD comes out about the Greatest Steel Cage matches??? ever???? And two of the most awesome matches are nowhere to be found again........Of course I am talking about Ric Flair vs Ron Garvin(Starrcade 87... and Dusty Rhodes vs Lex Luger(Starrcade 87)...I have seen a few of these sets come out now and there is no sign of these matches anywhere.. I was even hoping that when the Starrcade set came out they would put these two on there...Of course.. no such luck. I am so tired of dvd sets coming out with the same matches that they have released before over and over...it is so tiresome.... How hard can this be??? With all due respect, i will pass on this set.. again... Maybe the wwe should put someone in charge of their video library that has some clue of what the old school fans and even the new school ones would like...",1309219200,,855,4.452229299363057
4460364,3,B004RBC5RO,"Just label me as an optimist; i'll choose to look at this WWE release devoted specifically to that landmark of wrestling gore, the steel cage, as a sign that Vince McMahon is wavering towards returning to the more violent, somewhat more 'realistic' style of pro wrestling. Not that I expect the company to start giving the order for all 'Superstars', be they job guys or top dogs, to start bringing their blade to work.
  No need to jump right in-maybe begin the transition by allowing the words 'pro wrestling' to be uttered on their weekly pro wrestling program.
  I mean, let's face it: waiting around for TNA, or Impact, to fulfill it's expectations has run it's course, again and again. Despite my eternal optimism, i remain grounded in realism. And reality says TNA will continue it's sideways crabwalk, peppered with the occasional false hope that is always annihilated once the booking team decides to get 'innovative'. Sometimes, the oldies really are the goodies, and standards became standards for a reason. Please, TNA, stop trying to re-invent the wheel, remember that you're under solid financial leadership, and just take it out for a spin. Have some fun-maybe it'll be infectious to your audience.

  This release has several matches that have been on other compilations, naturally; it's getting increasingly difficult to avoid that. Still, even though i have 3 different DVD's that have the '82 Flair-Kerry V.E. NWA World title tilt, I welcome it's presence anytime. It does this old heart good to know that thousands of young fans will be able to see wrestling at it's creative and dramatic peak. Honestly, besides the '96 Hogan flip and a few others, is there a more famous match ending ever??

  All Hail the great Terry Gordy!

  I don't know if WWE has edited a lot of the bloodletting from these bouts; not all are splatterfests, but i'm willing to bet at least the cost of purchase that any cage match featuring Bruiser Brody vs Abdullah the Butcher just might step over the 'TV-PG' guidelines. And don't miss the AWA match between The Midnite Rockers (Michaels & Janetty) against Playboy Buddy Rose and Doug Somers. Trust me, it registers favorably on the 'Muta Scale'.",1308355200,2,2194,4.897297297297297

8438910,4,B004RBC5RO,"These Greatest of All Time sets are always topics for pointed debate, particularly when one has the library of cage matches that the WWE must have. Things get complicated further when one asks the basic question What makes a good cage match? It might be wiser to think of the Greatest Cage Matches of All Time set as more of a look at how the cage match has evolved over time.

Disc One could be considered the era of the more technical based cage match where the cage is most often there to keep one out and occasionally ram your opponents anatomy into it, often bringing the crimson mask. Disc Three showcases some of the more extreme cage matches of the 2000s with more high risk maneuvers, outside interference, and often times action taking place outside and inside the cage and the introduction of objects. Meanwhile Disc Two, is something of a transitional hybrid where theres still very technical aspects, but outside influence becomes more common.
