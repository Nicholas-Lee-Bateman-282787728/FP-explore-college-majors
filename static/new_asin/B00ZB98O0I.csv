7275685,5,B00ZB98O0I,This was an amazing documentary. Not a high budget film but the content is extraordinary. Thank you for making this!,1445731200,3,116,4.85
7275686,5,B00ZB98O0I,"I've speculated for a long time about the structure and nature of reality. One of the many ideas I've contemplated has been what's called the Simulation Hypothesis. The idea that reality is an artificial simulation: say, a computerized virtual reality, some kind of divinely cosmic construct, or any other number of possibilities. This video explores the concept in very clear and easily understood detail. The explanation of the double slit experiment is one of the best I've ever seen. Using various scientific findings from the Einsteinian era up to the present, God Science presents a compelling argument that the Simulation Hypothesis may well be an accurate description of reality. I found the hypothesis at least plausible even before seeing this episode, but after watching it I find it even more likely as a model for how existence works. If you're on the fence, or even skeptical, this is worth watching as it gives much food for thought. If you're already open to the idea, it still holds much value, as it can strengthen your arguments in favor of this worldview. I look forward to future installments of God Science. Well done!",1440374400,3,1140,4.973821989528796
7275687,5,B00ZB98O0I,"I love anything that makes me question, and I love everything that makes me think. This truly did both. It was extremely well crafted. I was thoroughly engaged, and kudos to delivering what could be dry and confusing information. The narration was engaging and the graphics were clear. The production value was superior. I'm looking forward to the next episode.",1433980800,3,361,5.033333333333333
7275688,5,B00ZB98O0I,It's true,1484092800,,9,4.0
7275689,5,B00ZB98O0I,Interesting and beautiful view of what could very well be the strangest truth of all.,1483401600,,85,4.733333333333333
7275690,5,B00ZB98O0I,I enjoyed this movie/documentary I enjoyed the philosophy and science that It used to back up its arguments and that it explored both sides of the arguments.. great movie,1482624000,,170,4.896551724137931
7275691,4,B00ZB98O0I,This was a solid and concise overview of the concept.  It walked through what the simulation hypothesis is as well as the science that supports the idea.  The most beneficial part of this however was exposing how many people and organizations are actively researching the concept.  I was blown away by how active research is into this area still. This is a show that anyone with interest in science can enjoy without having to have a PhD.,1482019200,,438,4.662337662337662
7275692,5,B00ZB98O0I,"This documentary is really well done!  I recommend it highly and even for rank amateur physicist wannabees like myself, it pulls those challenging theories together  in an understandable manner using lots of visual aids and supporting interviews from notables in the field.",1477008000,,273,5.476190476190476
7275693,5,B00ZB98O0I,"Hits on some great points, and does a good job of explaining the double slit experiment.",1475712000,,88,4.5625
7275694,5,B00ZB98O0I,Alternate view. It was a fantastic alternate view and must likely the correct one.,1475107200,,82,4.928571428571429
7275695,5,B00ZB98O0I,A must watch.,1474934400,,13,3.6666666666666665
7275696,5,B00ZB98O0I,"fascinating, science is saying that what was said by Buddha 2600 years ago
"" you exist, you do not exist""  is true.",1474329600,,115,4.2272727272727275
7275697,3,B00ZB98O0I,"While I have seen better programs on this concept, it is an interesting one and anyone unfamiliar with the subject would find it interesting.",1474156800,,141,4.916666666666667
7275698,4,B00ZB98O0I,Interesting stuff these guys are thinking about,1473897600,,47,5.857142857142857
7275699,5,B00ZB98O0I,A great and provocative look at existence. Loved every minute,1473811200,,61,5.2
7275700,5,B00ZB98O0I,Very interesting concept with good solid arguments!,1473811200,,51,6.428571428571429
7275701,4,B00ZB98O0I,"According to the hypothesis is this video, it may not be. It and you are simulation in a cast computer.  An interesting concept that upsets conventional thinking.",1473552000,,162,5.0
7275702,3,B00ZB98O0I,"Presents the information in a largely correct and interesting manner. One major point that they got wrong was that in Quantum Mechanics ""observation"" does not require consciousness, merely a measurable interaction. Also, the Simulation Hypothesis has not been ""proven"". That is a very high bar. There is significant evidence that does require very convoluted solutions and hidden variables in order to explain with materialism, but the debate between ""Idealism"" and ""Materialism"" is far from settled.",1473552000,2,500,5.68
7275703,2,B00ZB98O0I,"Some interesting ideas, but not a convincing argument. Another Science fad that probably won't gain traction.",1473465600,3,109,5.875
7275704,5,B00ZB98O0I,"Absolutely mind blowing.  Dumbed down just enough; beautifully edited and scripted; excellent explanations.  Just do not know what to do with this information!  If this is a virtual reality, why am I not rich?",1473292800,,209,5.088235294117647
7275705,4,B00ZB98O0I,Really makes you think,1473292800,,22,4.75
7275706,5,B00ZB98O0I,A scientific look at how the universe might actually work.,1473120000,,58,4.9
7275707,2,B00ZB98O0I,"An interesting theory, not worth pursuing thru this video.  However, I like to listen to programs while I garden and this one needed just little enough attention that the gardening did not suffer.",1473033600,2,196,4.9393939393939394
7275708,5,B00ZB98O0I,Creative presentation of this difficult to understand concept,1472515200,,61,6.75
7275709,5,B00ZB98O0I,"This show was very entertaining and well produced.  I must admit, I was expecting something along the lines of aliens have taken your brain and put it in a jar on this prison planet.  Instead, it was a fun exploration of basic quantum theory, physics philosophy, and the ultimate nature of reality, and it did not insult the viewers intelligence.
Did this production prove that were existing is some kind of simulation?  Of course not, but it made it enjoyable and thought-provoking to explore the possibility.
Youll probably want to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with a couple of easy basics of Quantum theory, such as superposition and the double slit experiment so that you can get the most enjoyment out of this show.",1472342400,3,734,4.809523809523809
7275710,4,B00ZB98O0I,"Very interesting. A unique idea, backed by somewhat promising evidence.",1472256000,,71,6.2
7275711,5,B00ZB98O0I,Great work,1472256000,,10,4.5
7275712,5,B00ZB98O0I,"Very thought provoking abd well presented documentary.
Highly recommend.",1472169600,,72,7.111111111111111
7275713,3,B00ZB98O0I,"The film is well made and makes some interesting/good arguments but the idea that the behavior of matter depends on consciousness I think is no longer considered explanatory by most physicists. 5 stars from presentation side, 1 star from should have known better than to present a largely discredited theory and not even mention the configuration/amplitudes quantum mechanics explanation. Search for ""Quantum Physics Revealed As Non-Mysterious"" as one source if you want to learn more.",1472169600,2,485,5.48
7275714,3,B00ZB98O0I,"This is certainly an interesting exposition of ideas. It held my attention and was pretty entertaining.

That said, it is a shame (as another reviewer pointed out) that Vedic and Buddhist teachings are not mentioned. The understandings set forth in this documentary were set forth thousands of years ago, even if their context was ""religious"" and not scientific. Plus, they were set forth in a way that is easier to understand, simpler, and more comprehensive. Does this not bear mentioning? A few passages from a Zen master like Dogen, or a champion of non-dualism such as Ramana Maharshi, or any number of Buddhist sutras, will reveal all of this and more. That's not to say that explanations grounded in science are not necessary and excitingbut historical precedents deserve mentioning, even if they involve brown people from India and the Orient who did not have the technology or wherewithal to fire electrons through slits.

It's a load of bollocks to claim that white, western scientists are the first human beings to arrive at so-called ""simulation theory."" Dressing it up in techie language like ""system"" and ""simulation"" does not make it new. This documentary describes an ancient worldview, not a modern one.

Also, what's with all the garish footage of SimCity characters dancing and acting like total morons? I can understand a few seconds of this, but some of the extended sequences are bizarre and don't seem to serve any purpose at all.

A pretty good effort though. I give it three stars.",1471910400,3,1506,4.98804780876494
7275715,4,B00ZB98O0I,I enjoyed the summary but wished it dove a little deeper into the referenced sources ...,1471824000,,88,4.5625
7275716,1,B00ZB98O0I,Seriously misunderstands a lot of the fundamental things he talks about and has proofs that contradict some of his other proofs.,1471737600,,128,5.142857142857143
7275717,5,B00ZB98O0I,"A deep subject on the science of reality was
made understandable by the explanation of the
double slit experiment, and how it proves the
Simulation Hypothesis.
Excellent presentation.",1471651200,,183,5.571428571428571
7275718,5,B00ZB98O0I,A memorable documentary that outlines a thought-provoking theory to explain mysterious quantum phenomena such as entanglement.,1471564800,,126,6.9375
7275719,4,B00ZB98O0I,"I almost didn't continue watching after the first few minutes. The presenter appeared to slightly talk down to the audience when mentioning philosophy and it's relevance to the content being presented. When discussing the history, there was only mention of Western philosophers. Leaving out Vedic philosophy which goes back thousands of years and has direct correlation to quantum theories being presented now is a little sad. Due to the great reviews, I continued to watch until the end. I feel that anyone interested in quantum physics would enjoy this video. It has somewhat of a low production value but the actual material presented is interesting and the manner it is presented is organized, clear and at a good pace.",1471046400,4,723,5.084033613445378
7275720,5,B00ZB98O0I,Simply Excellent,1470614400,,16,7.5
7275721,5,B00ZB98O0I,My summer school physics class LOVED it!,1470268800,,40,4.857142857142857
7275722,5,B00ZB98O0I,wow,1470096000,,3,3.0
7275723,5,B00ZB98O0I,"Deals with -- and answers! -- the fundamental question of the nature of our world and reality in a delightful, yet science-backed manner.  You will not  think about our world in the same way after you see this.",1469664000,,210,4.5
7275724,5,B00ZB98O0I,"VERY VERY VERY GOOD MOVIE! Well produced, solid foundation on SCIENCE FACT.",1469232000,,75,5.333333333333333
7275725,5,B00ZB98O0I,Excellent. Sitting and digesting the ideas and the possibilities that hold.,1466899200,,75,5.909090909090909
7275726,5,B00ZB98O0I,A thought provoking about the nature of reality.,1466812800,,48,5.125
7275727,5,B00ZB98O0I,A great work. Plenty of information about a much talked about idea today. The producers approach this hypothesis from a pro point of view.,1462924800,,138,4.791666666666667
8719735,2,B00ZB98O0I,"While sprinkled with valid scientific principles, the presentation implies a consensus that simply does not exist. Furthermore, no reputable physicist thinks that a human consciousness is capable of hacking the universe. It's sheer fantasy.",1532390400,,240,6.088235294117647
8719736,5,B00ZB98O0I,Wow. Really interesting concepts.  This documentary makes you question what reality is and how we influence reality by our own thoughts and actions.,1530403200,,148,5.434782608695652
8719737,5,B00ZB98O0I,Ordered this as a gift and the recipient and absolutely loved it.,1506211200,,65,4.5
8719738,2,B00ZB98O0I,Misleading.  This isn't science.  It's a new age misinterpretation of science.,1502064000,,78,6.0
8719739,1,B00ZB98O0I,"I did not like this video much, it's mainly about all the science (most of which is theoretical rather than empirical science) experts have drawn up that may lead to the simulation theory (ST). So this video is not really about ST, but about all the science that MIGHT reveal ST to be correct--again, that's a ""might."" But again, that's mostly theoretical science (""curved space,"" Planck units, and other theoretical non-observables). Science changes through time, and especially in how old theories are replaced by new (that's Popperianism 101), so this does not do much good for understanding ST. More importantly, this video has very little to do with ST proper, it hardly even lays out even the most basic mechanics of it, let along getting into any nitty gritty details.",1502064000,,775,4.969230769230769
8719740,1,B00ZB98O0I,This is fifty minutes of my life I'll never get back.  This is such a distortion of the underlying ideas to suit 'magic' as in a different supernatural sort of mind or 'being' once again instead of science it is uncanny.  Just because someone is a 'physicist' with a Ph. D. does not mean that their peers hold their ideas in much esteem.  A doctorate does not make a person have the ability to speak immutable truth anymore than a math proof makes something actually true if one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect.  It is entirely possible that every observation and conclusion will be disproven next week....,1491004800,,617,4.685185185185185
8719741,5,B00ZB98O0I,"God Theory
This explains through science that a conscious thought created the universe and us. This is also known as God, although they playfully dance around saying that word at all, I thought it and now it's part of the show. Satan would ensue the world of materialism, a world in which Quantum Physics is false. Odd that Einstein chose the material world. I would like to believe ideals and materials are both part of my world.

What if the Black Hole center of our Galaxy is really a giant brain that listens to our every thought and in order to truly create an unrelated experiment we would have to enact the test in another Galaxy or outside the reach of our own.",1489190400,,669,4.439024390243903
8719742,5,B00ZB98O0I,This was an awesome explanation of the universe and our existence and how things work it is a must watch!!!!,1487462400,,108,4.45
8719743,5,B00ZB98O0I,"Although a very counter-intuitive set of theories, the film shows just how strange the reality of quantum physics has proven to be.  It is one of the best presentations I've seen of this very difficult but very interesting topic.",1486166400,,229,4.871794871794871
