2840766,2,B000QUCNPE,"This is an ""erotic"" Japanese ninja movie, though the use of ""erotic"" is somewhat generous.  Given anything below the waist is covered up over there (except for maybe the hardcore XXX stuff), all that's really left is the action, which is what you see in direct to video movies.  Save your money, I wish I had.",1215734400,6,309,4.5
2840767,4,B000QUCNPE,"This work is not too interesting as the story that treats the lady ninja. However, Lead actress's Yommi is cool and beautiful.
And, the point that she is tightening a black loincloth is real and epoch-
making. The loincloth is a traditional undergarment of Japan, and the samurai and the ninja should wear it.
When her change of clothes and she highly kick the enemy, the black loincloth can be clearly confirmed to our eyes. And, the undergarment digs into firmly between her groins and is very sexy.",1213920000,10,501,4.704545454545454
2840768,2,B000QUCNPE,Not what I had expected. Not worth more than a few $$'s. Save your money,1206748800,3,72,3.8666666666666667
2840769,1,B000QUCNPE,"I didn't have high expectations going into this movie, but apparently I didn't lower them far enough. :-)

Lady Ninja Kasumi has torpid dialogue, moribund action and the romantic scenes....well, if someone pulled that on me and called it making love, I'd have to re-educate them with hot tar and a knife. lol

This movie was so good that despite knowing the folks at the company who makes it, I won't be asking for the next in the series.",1205798400,2,438,4.531645569620253
2840770,3,B000QUCNPE,"Take a look at the box cover.  That is pretty much all you really need to know about ""Lady Ninja Kasumi"" (""Sanada Kunoichi Ninpo-den: Kasumi"") and whether or not it is the kind of thing you are interested in. It is exactly what you are expecting, a B-movie Pink Film with a lady ninja-theme.  The company that puts out this series is called Junk Films, and they have produced such other classics as ""Death Penalty Female Prisoner Saori"". And there you have it.

Oh, there is a story.  Poor Kasumi and her little brother are orphaned, but taken in by a local warlord.  Kasumi joins the kunoichi, the lady ninjas, in order to work and protect her little bother.  There are some spies and intrigues, and some entirely unspectacular fight scenes.  The costumes are nice, but the whole thing has a feel of being shot on digital video, and you know that this is not a high-budget production.  The film is based on an erotic manga series, but I have never read that so don't know how well it holds up.  Director Hiroyuki Kawasaki normally makes anime flicks like ""Mouse"" and ""Sakura Wars"", so this may have been his first time with live actors.

But if you are getting this, you are really getting it for the lovely Yonmi, not for the story.  She looks great in her ninja costumes, and is appropriately bouncy for the genre.  Being a Pink Film, the nudity is strictly T&A the three sex scenes are of the softcore variety.  Not anywhere near a great film, but then you weren't expecting that.  For what it is, it does a good job.  The girls are pretty, the plot is decent, and there are far worse entries in the genre.",1189468800,30,1610,4.447098976109215

8197554,1,B000QUCNPE,"Delivery was great but the movie is a complete disaster. The acting, props, makeup, blood and action sequences were so terrible and fake it was hard to watch. Don't waste your time or money on this movie series.",1468022400,,211,4.578947368421052
8197555,2,B000QUCNPE,"The three films on separate discs  (about an hour and 19 minutes each) are part of a series of tales about Sanada clan Lady Ninja Kasumi, who doesn't really appear to be neither. During this era there is feudal lord issues as they strive to protect their territory. Kasumi has developed a talent for getting captured, tied up, groped, up skirted and raped. Not that it makes for a bad film, but the other action is not fulfilling once you set the bar that high.  And how is it everyone knows about the secret scroll?

My disc one had no English subtitles but did have an extra for an outtake of all the nude scenes which I guess counts for something.

Guide: sex and nudity.",1462147200,2,674,4.368
8197556,2,B000QUCNPE,"Definitely not soft porn, at least not in the western sense, there are a few breasts here and there, but nothing that will appeal to anyone except 12 year olds. The only 2 scenes that might be considered to be close to erotic are on the third disc. Three different women play Kasumi, not that it matters because the story, acting and locations are pretty much the same on all 3 discs, even though the 2nd and 3rd seem to be connected item wise. Pretty much the same things happen in all 3 discs, the female Shinobi is introduced to us, she is given a task, she is injured and then nursed back to health, tricked and then completes her task. The acting, especially of the females is pretty much high school level, the actor who plays the character Mufuu is probably the best of the bunch here. The action sequences, if you can call them that, are quite obviously blocked out, and the erotic scenes if you can call them that are anything but, and there is at least one scene of sexual assault on each disc, making the movies even less entertaining. These are super low budget grind house movies, and even at the low price I paid they are just not worth it. If you are looking for eiga movies like this, get the Ninja-Thon collection at least those have some redeeming value.",1449187200,2,1272,4.3940677966101696

8197560,1,B000QUCNPE,"I can't recommend this movie. It was bland, unbelievable and boring. The historical relevance was not real and the acting was as 3rd rate as the plotskip it!!",1390176000,,158,4.678571428571429
8197561,1,B000QUCNPE,"Seeing as how I trashed the third volume in this series a while ago, I thought I'd possibly save some poor unsuspecting fool from forking over hard-earned cash on this swill as well. I got two volumes as screeners to review (thank god I didn't lay out coin for them) and honestly don't know who this stuff is marketed to. Really. Yeah, the covers look OK, but we were always told not to judge a book by its cover, right? Is it the swordplay? No, you'd see better at a Renaissance Fair. Acting? A high school play couldn't do worse. Nudity? Even 12 year-olds know where to find better titillation than this tame, tepid dry-hump. Sets and special effects? With the exception of the few, from-the-waist-up sex scenes, all the activity takes place outdoors, in the woods no less, letting you know there wasn't a buck available for an indoor set, let alone a special effects budget. All five flicks in this series are an insult to any audience - find a copy of 'Azumi' for some true kick-ass swordfighting with an adorable, capable lead actress, or get 'The Naked Sword' if you dig soft-core swordplay that's still mindlessly exploitive.",1282262400,2,1132,4.665
