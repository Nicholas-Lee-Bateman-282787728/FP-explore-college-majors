2581353,3,B000FP2YYA,"This is the second ""Ultimate Avengers"" film, adapted from the comic of the same name. Unlike the ""standard"" Avengers comic, the Ultimates offers more realistic and gritty stories.

Sadly, alot of that hard-edged story telling is missing from the animated films (and where the heck is Hawkeye??! My personal pet peeve..), no wife-beating, no wife-beater beating, no blood, no sex - no Shield Heli-Carriers (why? I have no idea, they would look great in a movie). The movie does have some of the elements present in the comic and I liked the addition of the Vibranium/Wakanda plotline. I always thought that the Black Panther was pretty cool.

Who is the audience for this movie? Fans of the comic won't be too thrilled by the milquetoast adaptation of the comic, but this movie is too violent for kids.

Ultimate Avengers 2 is worth seeing, but I hope the next one is alot better and more faithful to the comic.",1154995200,12,910,4.746835443037975
2581354,4,B000FP2YYA,"Alert: some spoilers here.

There is a hidden nation named Wakanda deep in the vastness of Africa. Wakanda is an isolationist nation, deeply mistrustful of outsiders. Because of its ready access to vibranium, Wakanda has one of the most advanced technologies on earth, though it chooses to draw from both low- and high-tech resources. When Herr Kleiser, an alien Chitari in disguise (as well as Captain America's Nazi nemesis going back to WW2), assassinates the current King of Wakanda, Nick Fury fears an alien agenda and assembles the Avengers. He sends them to Africa on an infiltration and fact-finding mission. But sneaking into hostile Wakanda is easier said than done. The Avengers get their butts handed to them by Wakandans - who are armed only with bows and arrows, spears, and logs - and are forced to retreat. Meanwhile, Kleiser and his Chitari soon put their world-conquering scheme into motion, forcing the weary Avengers and T'Challa, the newly-ascended monarch of Wakanda (and also the new Black Panther), to rally and once again save the world from global invasion.

On a personal level, the always volatile relationship of Giant Man and the Wasp deteriorates some more, as Hank Pym's constant shifts in body mass begin to take its toll, giving rise to his always sub-surface feelings of inadequacy. Or, to put it more simply, he's even more of a jerk here. Captain America is unhealthily always in soldier mode, unwilling to invest in any down time and still very much obssessed with Herr Kleiser. Bruce Banner (Hulk), for his recent grievious loss of control, is still incarcerated in heavy SHIELD confines. This film also introduces the noble afore-mentioned T'Challa, who must defy age-old tradition and accept the aid of outsiders to save his homeland from the Chitari.

After having thoroughly enjoyed the first Ultimate Avengers movie, I was salivating to see this one. Well, it didn't disappoint. While I don't believe it's as good as the first one, this is still dynamic, top-notch entertainment. Set in cinematic widescreen mode, this is 73 more minutes of intense, testosterone-laden superhero action at its finest. It's stupefying how many times in this movie folks fall from a great height and create deep craters in the ground. Or that's the impression I get, anyway. And here's a big spoiler: there is a death in the Avengers family. Also, Iron Man changes into a new armor (but, then again, Tony Stark changes into more new armor than Spider-Man is cloned).

Parents and babysitters beware: there is a PG-13 level of brutal violence shown here as the sequel refuses to pull punches. Torsos and arms are pierced by claws, arrows, and bullets. Humans and aliens (but mostly aliens) are graphically torn to bits, eviscerated, defenestrated, and blown up.

Some negatives immediately do come to mind. First: the giant surface attack machines on those spindly mechanical legs are too reminiscent of the War of the Worlds tripod machines. Second: Geez! Enough with the shafeshifting Chitari aliens already (they are now officially played out). Three: not enough Hulk or Thor. Four: the story, while intense and big in jeopardy, is still one-note and cliched. Plus, the personal arcs of the characters aren't that involving this time.

Here are the DVD special features: a revealing, 24-minute ""The Ultimates"" segment, in which mostly comic book writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch talk in depth about the genesis, background, motivations, and choices made regarding the Ultimates 1 and 2 comic books and they also touch on the 2 animated films; a juvenile but very funny gag reel (I think Iron Man likes ribs); First Looks at the upcoming Iron Man and Dr. Strange animated films (and now I'm stoked to see THESE 2 movies!); a DVD-Rom Game: ""What Avenger Are You?""; and a trailer gallery.

True, the Avengers' animated exploits thus far haven't been as cosmic in scope as the animated Justice League's. But the Ultimates' global escapades, in my opinion, are certainly of myth-making quality and awe-inspiring enough that they should resonate at some level for all comic-book and superhero fans. So, a four star rating from me and a big recommendation.",1154995200,6,4185,5.039017341040463
2581355,5,B000FP2YYA,"I just read a review that declares Ultimate Avengers 2 the ""Best Animated Superhero Movie of All-Time!"" I'll go one better. It may be the best animated action movie of all-time, beating big boys like Titan AE, Transformers and The Iron Giant. Most sane people will soon agree that it certainly beats any single episode of Justice League, X-Men Evolution, Batman or Spider-Man. Some want to compare it to these TV series and their entire run but that's apples and oranges. If Ultimate Avengers spins off in to a series, then there can be discussion. As it stands now, it sets the bar quite high for future releases.

Ultimate Avengers 1 was good but it had pacing issues. This movie moves fast and keeps you entertained from start to amazing finish. This is a smart and surprisingly interesting film that really delivers. Calling this movie a cartoon doesn't really seem right or do it justice. A+",1154822400,6,896,4.743589743589744
2581356,5,B000FP2YYA,"Lots of folks stated they hated the first film [mostly because they could not separate themselves from the comics] and those same people are back saying they hate this one. Well as I said before, give it a chance.

The story picks up where the other film lets off [so see Ultimate Avengers The Movie as well]. Although this is a stand alone film some elements require you do watch the first film to 'get' everything.

The alien attack plot thickens, we lose an Avenger and we get to know our heroes better.

Special features are worth a viewing as well with first looks at Iron Man and Dr. Strange as well as interviews and a 'blooper' reel. ""Hulk no want ribs!"" Keep it up Marvel we want more!",1154476800,11,694,4.364341085271318
2581357,4,B000FP2YYA,"I saw the first one so I know what to expect. It is not a surprise some of the darker storylines, particularly the part about Hank & Janet, were toned down since they probably need the kid market.

Given that, the film is actually pretty entertaining. The animation is a bit better than the first one although still not up to par to the best JLU. I like the characters. They are a bit more edgy than the DC super heroes.

The plot is ok and I like the addition of the Black Panther. I also like my anime with a little blood and gore ... refreshing from TV stuff although UA2 is no where close to Japanese anime in the area of portraying violence.",1154390400,3,646,4.16
2581358,5,B000FP2YYA,"I enjoyed the first entry on Marvel's ""Ultimate Avengers"" animated movie series. They reached a nice balance between the classic version of the 1960's ""Avengers"", and their recent reboot, the ""Ultimates"", which is sharper and more violent. I must say they behave more like the original 1960's series, with most of the Ultimates stories toned down, a lot. That [...] version of the HULK in the comic, well, while it's funny to read, it would be quite ambarassing to see onscreen, specially if you're watching it with your wife.

At least, they kept some key moments, like Steve Roger's letter to his girlfriend, being narrated while he's sinking on the freezing ocean is heart breaking. Moments like that, and those very human scenes with him adapting to the modern world, collecting old vinyl records would be perfect for a Captain America movie.

Albeit nothing can top DC's ""Justice League"" animated series, it is great to see Marvel's standing up with their own version of the ""JL"", the Avengers, even if it's not a regular series. I believe it should be, and i would love to see adapted not only the ""Ultimate"" comic book series"", but also classic Avengers stories, with villains like Kang, Loki and others.

I'd love to see the big three's friendship developed even more, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor.

My only complaint is the shape of the Mjolnir hammer, well, it's a hammer, not an axe. But i can live with that.

Nah, keep them coming, i want a collection of 10 Avengers movies at mininum, with plenty of special guest, like the Silver Surfer, Dr. Strange and Spiderman..well, the entire Marvel universe, the Watcher included! =)",1154044800,6,1644,4.8362989323843415

2581473,4,B000FP2YYA,"Picking up pretty much right where Ultimate Avengers left off, Ultimate Avengers 2 starts off in Wakanda and the kingdom falls under attack from Herr Kleiser, who kills the king and sends the prince, TChalla, into action by taking up the mantle of the Black Panther. Black Panther then heads to the city to find Captain America. The Avengers are assembled and head to Wakanda to stop the Chitauri threat, resuming their battle from the first movie.

I liked the first movie a bit better, but probably because it was the birth of the Avengers vs them in full swing but thats just me: I like origin stuff. Ultimate Avengers 2, however, is still a solid flick and falls right in line with its predecessor. (Always recommend watching these two back-to-back if you have the time, and with a little-over-an-hour runtime each, thats definitely doable.)

The battles in this flick are awesome and showcase some all-out superhero-vs-alien mayhem. Like the first, each character gets their moment to shine and its like being reacquainted with old friends.

I love the depiction of the Avengers in this. Everyone is their stereotypical selves, something that they captured in the live action movie, but, to me, got even more right in this flick. Totally adds to it.

Like the first, the art direction is top notch. Everyone matches the way they looked in the first movie, giving it that sense of continuity. They had the same voice talent as the first for this as well. I love it when animated flicks keep the cast consistent outing-to-outing.

Watching this flick along with the first makes it a good final act to a stellar movie, but can also stand just fine on its own.

Glad I have it as part of my superhero movie collection.

This movie not only has plenty of action but it also fills in massive information about several of the Avengers, especially Captain America.

2581504,1,B000FP2YYA,"I was rather disappointed by the first Ultimate Avengers, but after seeing a great trailer for Rise of the Black Panther, I thought this could be a pretty successful sequel.  Boy was I ever wrong.  The story picks up where the first one left off.  Captain America is trying to lead The Avengers and most of the team is reluctantly following or outright quitting.  Bruce Banner spends most of the movie in a prison chamber and whines more than I thought was humanly possible (-exception: Twilight).  T'Challa, Prince of Wakanda (a lost primitive/advanced paradise in Africa), is made King when his father is murdered by a Nazi Chitauri shapeshifter, (yes, the lame alien villains from the first Avengers movie).  T'Challa gets into contact with Cap. America, and the Avengers try to investigate why the aliens are poking around Wakanda.  But oh no, they stepped on the culturally insensitive Wakanda, who won't allow outsiders into their kingdom!  Some rather convoluted stuff happens and it turns out the aliens are trying to steal the power source behind Wakanda.  Eventually there's a huge battle between the Chitauri and the forces of Earth, (think ID4), and the Avengers get to kick alien butt.

Black Panther isn't really so awful, except for the part where I'm supposed to care.  I really, seriously, had *no reason* to care.  About 3 minutes into the film we realize that the main villain is once again the Chitauri, who were a good concept but are esthetically unconvincing as a global threat.  They just aren't interesting enough to be the villains for two films.  Oh, and whoever designed Wakanda looks like they were never told it's supposed to be in Africa.  The architecture is extremely similar to Aztec and Mayan designs, not African.  I'm not a hater, but that whole Wakanda bit was just totally unconvincing.

There's actually some good moments and improvements here, especially a bold move to kill off one of the Avengers. But it just ain't enough.  Between the aliens and Wakandan architecture, my wife kept telling me to just turn it off.  But I do have to add, having both of the Ultimate Avengers films under my belt made the New Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow pretty enjoyable.",1278720000,,2198,4.876010781671159

2581506,3,B000FP2YYA,"The action is good, though the story seems like a retread of the first one.  Also, Captain America's character is a bit more neurotic in this one, which is annoying.  The Hulk is once again pretty much an after-thought, since he is a factor only at the end.  However, that being said, the story holds together well enough for you to care what happens, and I recommend watching it more than once to get the full impact.  Not especially appropriate for the under-10 group, but tweens will like it a lot.",1267142400,,501,4.472527472527473

2581508,2,B000FP2YYA,"Lame ... lame in so many ways.

Whereas over the past ten years African American writers have turned the comic book Panther into a bold, proud, A-list force to be reckoned with whose strongest power lies in his ability to out think, out strategize, and out politically maneuver his foes, those paths have been abandoned for this film. Here, the panther is a confused and unsure boy, too soon abandoned by his father, whose first instinct is to reach out to the predominantly white American heroes to save him and his country. The story presents any self-dependance on Wakanda's part as foolish, fearful, and ultimately fatal. No. Maturity, of course, argues for the integrationist solution. ""You must open your borders!""

On top of that, the dialog feels leaden, and the emotional arcs of Cap and the Panther suffer from a lack of subtlety in both conception and execution. How did we get from a joyfully victorious Captain America at the end of the previous film to this grimly troubled man harboring a death wish? Who knows? The writers needed conflict and just created it, trusting to the dullness of their audience to allow it to slide. And do we really need one more hero devastated and haunted by the loss of his father? I know it's classic and that Joseph Campbell likes you, but is that really the only story we have in our story boxes? Yes, T'Chakka's death is part of the comic lore, but it's merely one aspect of T'Challa's origin, not the center of it.  To be fair, though, most of the other heroes are handled rather well.

But story and writing aside ... while the animation is a step forward from Captain Planet, it's still so far behind what the Japanese regularly do in terms of detail, color subtlety, fluidity of motion, and character design as to be virtually unwatchable.",1252627200,3,1792,4.697452229299363

I was hoping the sequel would be better, but it's pretty much more of the same. The alien invaders are back, and they're still kinda generic and uninteresting. Voice acting is decent, but I never really got attached to these heroes like I wanted to. I suppose the looser guidelines on violence should appeal to older fans like me, but when the story is bland like it is here, the violence just comes off as a forced attempt to be 'edgy.' There was one twist in the ending though that caught me by surprise.

I wish they'd made this a full tv series, giving the creative team time to work out the kinks. UA2 will give you enough of a superhero fix, but it won't leave you satisfied.",1182384000,2,787,4.390410958904109
2581519,1,B000FP2YYA,"Initially I was really pleased to receive this new DVD.  I played the ""Which Avenger Are You"" DVD rom game and it said I resembled Thor!  You can make different choices and change your gender to view other characters.  This game is repeated from Ultimate Avengers DVD.

This sequel was very disapointing.  The plot development and the return of the alien invasion reminded me of The Justice League premiere movie.  I found I was not surprised when you understand the marvel formula - the hero will suffer or die, despite their power just to say ""we are human"".  What I mean here is that the whole movie was a bad soap opera, way too melodramatic and very cliched or stereotyped in areas.  I could go in specific details, but I just don't have the time because most is too negative i am afraid.

I listened to the commentary and found that the creators contradicted what they set out to do.  What they deemed 'cool' was in fact 'cold'.  Sorry my review is probably not want you want to read, but, I really feel this is a film for die hard fans to see these characters animated.  There was room for huge potential, the animation is fine, the voices are fine and fit the characters, but the story itself has just been done too many times in other mediums and this was not NEW.

Perhaps forgetting the alien invasion and sticking to telling a traditional Avengers story with known bad guys would have have made this movie more memorable.

Overall I was not happy with the movie, but, this is probably better than nothing at all.

2581523,4,B000FP2YYA,"For the past few years, DC's animated division has had it all over Marvel, their Justice League, JLU, Batman, and Superman animated series dominated much weaker Marvel efforts.

Ultimate Avengers and its sequel change that. The first movie was a good take on these character, but the second movie improves upon that, introducing the Black Panther.

The animation, while weak at some points, gets the job done and the voice acting ranges from below average to excellent. The voice actor for Tony Stark (Iron Man) does a great job portraying him as the cool playboy, and the actor for Giant Man does a pretty good as portraying the arrogant and cocky Hank Pym.

For parents out there, Ultimate Avengers is actually a pastiche of the comic book characters ""The Ultimates"" and ""The Avengers"". The characters are much like the Ultimates, but the storylines are much more like those found in the Avengers.

I would not recommend parents allowing their children to read ""The Ultimates"" thinking it is like the animation, because quite frankly, if they translated the comic directly, it would have been rated R. Giant Man is an abusive husband, Thor is a delusional drunk, Iron Man is an alcoholic...you get the picture.

As an animation, this does a favorable job of portraying these comic book heroes and does it in an old school way, its a simple good guys vs. bad guys story that isn't patronizing in a ""superfriends"" sort of way.

I definately recommend this for comic book and superhero fans alike, and its good to see Marvel putting together some respectable animation efforts.",1174348800,2,1576,4.883895131086143

The story is formulaic to the point that I'm surprised the authors weren't sued by either the creators of the films Star Wars or Independence Day or the debut story of the JLA animated series, created by Marvel's chief rival in the comics industry, DC. The story features an alien invasion in which the way to defeat the enemy is to penetrate the mother ship and destroy it's core. Gee, I've never seen THAT before! How creative!

The voice talent is mostly bad (the worst being the awful faux Russian accented Black Widow) and the animation is a Frankenstein-like combination of low-quality illustrated art and CGI.

My eight-year-old son was marginally entertained by it, but I could barely stay awake watching it. It looks to me like Marvel wanted to invest a low amount of money to get a decent return and capitalize a bit more on the success of the company's live-action features.

At the very least, Marvel should have hired the animation firm that did their MTV Spider-Man series. That series was pretty dull, too, but at least it had some sense of what it wanted to be unlike this mottled hodgepodge of animated styles and technology.

I guest it's just the signs of the times. I mean kids are so accustomed to seeing blood and gore in their video games, why not their cartoon series, right? No wonder, some have no qualms about pulling guns on peers and shooting them in the head.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD to children. I would be doing a disservice to society.",1162944000,5,587,4.528301886792453

I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do.  The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch.  But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far.  There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers.  Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room.  I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film.  For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often.  For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again.",1162598400,4,896,4.074285714285714

2581539,4,B000FP2YYA,"Okay, I like the Ultimate Avengers volume one. It retold the Avengers origin with some nice modern day touches. Was it great animation, better than most out there.

Now to the Avengers two-It was a good piece of storytelling. This made for DVD cartoon introduced us to the Black Panther and his land Wakanda(can someone say another animated feature character film coming soon?). well nasty aliens attack panther's  kingdom> h breaks down and goes to and  asks the Avengers for help.

This story seem watered down in scope from the first film. It is well told animated tale..but misses the impact that the first film had, If you  are a student of film, this is a major epic battle movie (SPOLER ALERT)--so there is a DEATH of a major SUPERHERO character..lets say this, it isn't Captain America

Now the bad news...I like the Hulk character. The Hulk, to me, was part of the classic Avengers comic-it worked like Wolverine works in Xmen comics. So why in the film does someone kidnap him, give Hulk  NOTHING to do for almost the whole movie and have him show up in the last five minutes to join the battle. My mind boogles

The extras have previews of two upcoming Marvel animated films coming soon-Iron Man and Dr Strange. This DVD also has a gag reel of cute bad taste, off color jokes (I LOVED IT!)-note for KIDS. The documentary is how MARVEL comics created the original comic series where this film was based from

Marvel I wish you would do this for Cartoon Network. The animation is good. This work would be a great companion to the DC animated show Teen Titans, Batman and Justice League. One can only hope

Of course origins must be altered and so is this one but it ties in with bringing the Avengers back for more mayham.  The Hulk is left as a cameo at the end and mostly the story belongs to Black Panther, Captain America, and a whiny Henry Pym.  Overall not a bad fare but could have been so much better with a more developed script that focused more on character and less on action but that's just me.  I want to point out the extra features including the gag reel.  It's hysterical with a running joke about Stark Enterprises restaurant.

Yuk for the sidekicks (No offense all the other hero's are just sidekicks to the HULK) blah, blah. While the Black Panther was cooler than I thought he would be, This was boring.

2581543,5,B000FP2YYA,"The Avengers have returned for a sequel but unfortunately for them, so have those nasty aliens called the Chitari!

  The first Ultimate Avengers was a nice surprise for me and I must say that Marvel and Lionsgate have improved on their technique with this second animated feature.  The story starts in in the xenophobic African nation called Wakanda where the people are governed by a King who also serves as a warrior called the Black Panther.  Once the king is killed by a Chitari alien who is leading an invasion of Earth (and witnessed by his son), the newly returned heir to the throne takes on the responsiblity of his father's royal position.  The elders in the King's councel are not happy that the young prince had been sent abroad for his education and are even less thrilled once they find out he has allowed the Avengers to sneak into their mysterious homeland to aid him in finding his father's killer.

Though the people of Wakanda are unwelcoming of foreigners, they eventually must unite with the Avengers in order to fight the alien threat that will be catstrophic to the entire planet.  The secret of the African kingdom's advanced technology and the reason for their isolationist attitude is revealed as the story moves along.  Black Panther is a great super hero and I hope he returns in any upcoming films!

I have to give Marvel credit for their respresentation of their heroes over the last decade.  From Spiderman to the X-Men and now these excellent animated films, they are giving their super heroes the best stories and animation, creating a whole new generation of fans.  To my surprise, they don't shy away from violence and even kill off a character in this sequel.  Storylines are continued in the sequel with Bruce Banner still battling the green monster inside, Captain America's adjustment to life in the present and a blossoming romance between two characters.

As for extras, there is a featurette about the making of the two Avenger films that is quite informative and also two trailers for upcoming films that also look good---Iron Man and Dr. Strange.  There are some good extras on this dvd that add to the enjoyment of this dvd.  This is a welcome addition to any Marvel fan's dvd library!",1156723200,,2231,4.770833333333333
2581544,5,B000FP2YYA,"Ultimate Avengers 2 improves on every aspect of the first animated feature from Marvel, picking up right after the events of the first film. The hidden African nation of Wakanda has a secret, one so big that the shape shifting alien race from the first film will do anything to bring them down, prompting newly crowned Black Panther T'Challa to reluctantly call upon Nick Fury and the Avengers for help. Bruce Banner remains imprisoned after his betrayal and Hulk fueled massacre, Captain America is haunted by his past, Thor has dark visions of the future, the marriage between Giant Man and the Wasp is on the verge of coming to an explosive end, and we are given a brief glimpse into Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark's physical debilitation (which will be more touched upon in the Iron Man animated feature due out before the end of the year). The action is quick (and surprisingly violent) and nicely captures the tone of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's Ultimates comic series, and it still manages to throw in a few surprises as well. The extras are nice, including interviews with Millar and Hitch, and sneak peeks at the upcoming Iron Man and Doctor Strange animated features, as well as a very juvenile and very funny gag reel (Tony Stark loves ribs) that all help make this DVD worth the price of admission. Let's hope that there's more Ultimate Avengers to come.",1156377600,10,1359,4.714285714285714
2581545,4,B000FP2YYA,"This second installment of the Ultimate Avengers is a good one.  However, it's not as good as the first.  There are some improvements in this one, but also some things that aren't as good.

The story takes place in Wakanda, the land of the Black Panther.  It continues the story from the last film, where the aliens are after something in Wakanda.

Captain America finds his old Nazi nemesis is back.  Hank Pym is trying to improve his work with the Pym particles with potentially lethal results.  Plus, his marriage with Janet Van Dyne (Pym), the Wasp, is on the rocks.  Bruce Banner is held in a containment facility where he can be monitored, unfortunately by a cruel, vindictive doctor.  He is held under sedation to prevent him from turning into the Hulk.  Thor has a vision that dispells doom for the Avengers as he sees that they've all been killed, and despite Odin's warning not to interfere but to return to Asgard, Thor is hellbent on preventing this future event from happening.  Tony Stark is still dealing with the crippling effects surrounding his heart, but you get a nice look at his War Machine armor in this entry.

The Black Panther in this film is more like Wolverine, than the Black Panther.  He has indestructible claws that can seem to slice through anything.  Note that this was not among the Panther's weapons in the early comic books.  He was a well-trained fighter, possibly second only to Captain America.

One of the things that made the Avengers so much fun to read was having the ultimate commander doing his job on the field of battle.  Captain America is second to none when it comes to leading a team of Avengers into battle.  He is smart, and he knows how to best utilize the resources of his teammates.  He is what makes the Avengers a team, which is why he has been with the Avengers longer than anyone else.  I wish this element were used more in the film series, especially this one.  I'm afraid more of this element is bestowed upon Nick Fury.

Also, you don't get to see the Hulk until the very end, but then only for a moment.  To tell you the truth, there isn't a battle sequence in this whole film that rivals the battle between the Hulk and the Avengers from the last installment.  But, the battles sequences are pretty good, don't get me wrong.

I also feel that Iron Man is not ""invincible"" enough.  While I know the writers wanted to introduce the War Machine armor, I feel they've made him too easy to take out by enemies.  That armor is very strong, and not so easily damaged.  Tony Stark is also a master strategist when using that armor as well.  Interesting that he hasn't used his uni-beam at all in this film nor has he used much of his repulsor rays (the signature weapon of Iron Man's armor).  Why would he use bullets against an enemy that is invulnerable to them?

This is a pretty good second film entry in the series, and they've left the door open to possibly do another one.  There are some great extra features on this DVD.  The Gag Reel is really funny, and the interviews with the writers and artists of the Avengers is always interesting.

I'm hoping to see the Avengers tackle something that's more up their alley next time out.  I'd love to see them face off against Kang, or Ultron, or Loki.  The Justice League does more of the ""battle aliens from outer space.""  And quite frankly, the Avengers aren't the Justice League.  In many ways, they are more interesting.

The Justice League is made up of some of the most powerful superheroes in the DC universe.  Any ONE of them could give the Avengers a run, except for maybe Batman.  The Avengers at one point in their history had Captain America, Quicksilver, Hawkeye, and the Scarlet Witch...hardly contenders in the ""power"" department.  But Captain America knows how to outwit his enemies and get the best out of what he has.  This is one of the reasons why I prefer the Avengers, because they generally, overall,  aren't too powerful which makes them more interesting.

Enjoy this second entry.  It is a lot of fun.",1156291200,4,4037,4.544444444444444
2581546,5,B000FP2YYA,"I bought this about 4 days after it came out and let me say this is a big improvement over the first film (though it wasn't bad by any means).

In this one, we see Captain America refusing help as he basically takes each military assignment as a death walk! Iron-Man is still the jet-setting playboy. Thor is....well Thor. Black Widow is Captain America's partner but yearns to be more than that. Betty Ross is still hurt by Bruce's betrayal in the previous film while Hank & Janet Pym's marriage in on the brink of dissolving. All the while, the Chitari resurfaces in Africa and kills T'Chaka, King Of Wakanda and father of T'Challa. As a result, T'Challa takes over as king and accepts the mantle of The Black Panther from his father. While reluctant at first, he soon realizes that he must go against his kingdom's sacred rule of ""no outsiders"" if his precious kingdom of Wakanda is to survive and if he is to defeat Klieser. The man/alien that killed his father and the sworn enemy of Captain America.

The action and story is better developed here than in the first film. We also see the jealousy and resentment from Hank Pym towards Captain America, especially concerning his wife Janet Pym. While loyal to her husband, her admiration for Cap is obvious and she does wish for her man to be more like that than the brilliant but arrogant jackass that he is (though he DOES redeem himself at the end).

Thor also faces a crisis of his own as his father Odin forbids him from interfering in the Avengers/Chitari battle but defies him and sides with the Avengers anyway. During this fight, two Avengers are in grave peril. One nearly dies while the other DOES die! I won't tell you who but it is touching the way its done.

The only real complaint I have on this feature is the lack of The Hulk in this one as he is only in it for a few scenes (though his human alter ego Dr. Banner DOES play a pivitol part in helping to defeat the Chitari). Still, doesn't take away from the feature.

Overall, a very good buy!",1155945600,4,2014,4.4324324324324325

2581548,4,B000FP2YYA,"Ultimate Avengers 2 is the direct sequel to Ultimate Avengers.  Starting from where the first one left off, this edition continues the adventures of the Avengers, and brings Black Panther into the storyline. What I liked about Ultimate Avengers 2 is the story is better.  The aliens from the first film are more of a threat, the contined struggle of Hank and Janet, as well as the Hulk.  Actually, every member on the team is dealing with some personal inside issues.  The first film lacked story, but delivered on action.  This film delivers on story, but lacks the awesome fight scenes the first film had.

Adding Black Panther is a plus.  While I was never a fan of Black Panther in the comics, he plays a strong key role in the plot of the film.  I wonder which character will appear in the next film.  Thor and Hulk were under used.  Would of liked to see more of those guys.

Overall, a vast improvement.  Do I want more?  Yes, I can't wait for Ultimate Avengers 3.  The ending to Ultimate Avengers 2 certainly sets it up.  Still not as good as DC's animated films, but getting there.  Truly better than the recent Superman animated film.  Looking forward to Iron Man and Doctor Strange.  Add this film to your collection.  You'll enjoy it.

2581549,2,B000FP2YYA,"I liked the first Ultimate Avengers DVD. I thought it would make a fine jumping off point for a franchise. With Avengers 2, a leap is taken, but backwards. I'm not sure who their audience is supposed to be. It's got way too many ""relationship issues"" for kids and the adults will be turned off by lazy continuity and average-at-best animation.

I can appreciate the need to make a movie for the masses, but have a little respect for the history. The costumes we grew up with have all been streamlined,(removing Cap's wings? Please.) and the characters are all cliches. Not to mention the re-ethnicizing of Nick Fury and the Black Panther apparently raiding Batman's closet.

2581550,2,B000FP2YYA,"Avengers 2 contained all the elements of the first movie: fast paced action, daring heroics, snappy dialogue and vivid settings. Unfortunately, those elements were not enough to keep this second installment afloat in the face of one iceberg of an implausibility. I'll elaborate. It is highly implausible for a country that is supposed to be technologically advanced to have soldiers equipped only with spears, bows and arrows. Yet, Wakandia, the Black Panther's homeland, billed as one of the most advanced countries on Earth, can't put clothes on its soldiers or arm them with automatic weapons? This advanced nation can construct energy beam batteries capable of shooting invading alien attack craft out of the sky, but can't supply its military with tanks and armored vehicles? Sorry, but I wasn't buying it. The makers of Ultimate Avengers II suffered from a major deficit of vision when they conceived this contradictory, half baked portrait of Wakandia. All they succeeded in doing was churning out the same stereotype of Africa, replete with the same jungle and primitive native motif that has dominated traditional Hollywood perceptions of Africa for decades. Modern African militaries, even the most ill equiped, possess tanks and planes. The creators of the second movie could have equipped Wakandia in similiar fashion, albeit with much more cutting edge versions of those weapons. Only then would I have been convinced of Wakandia's ability to remain isolated and independent, while the rest of Africa was carved up with a colonial knife. Ultimate Avengers II would have been a better movie.  But its creators chose to to make a concession to sterotypes instead of logic.",1155427200,3,1683,5.233333333333333

2581552,5,B000FP2YYA,"I agree with all the reviews here.  This is a VERY good animated movie from MARVEL Studios distributed thru Lions Gate.

I recently rewatched the first one to refresh my memory on its story in preparation for this second one.  I'm glad I did, because these two movies are indeed sequels.  Well, the second is a sequel to the first...you know what I mean.  Anyway...

First of all, I really did this kind of animation.  A bit more realistic than Bruce Timm's Justice League style, but also more comic booky-looking.  By that I mean the animation looks like something you'd see in a average comic book THESE days.  You could freeze-frame any scene in these Ultimate flms and it'd look like a comic book frame.  Which is good.

Secondly, I love the Ultimates take on the characters.  As I'm not a comic book reader, I could care less about continuity at this point, so for this series to ""throw out"" any established continuity is a good thing for new viewers.  My favorite character by far is Iron Man.  Love his voice and his animation.  The aid of CG is a good thing for his character.  Especially when he dawns the War Machine suit, after Iron Man v6.2 is destroyed.

Thirdly, I love the level of violence.  This is a very mature animated film.  There's blood and people die.  The battle scenes in this movie are quite good.  Very dramatic and breath taking, if you will.  And as you might have gathered from other reviews, this series takes a page from Tom Cruise's ""War of the Worlds"", and the 3-part pilot of Justice League, ""Secret Origins"".

Also, as you may have guessed, there's a hilarious gag reel included with this disc which basically features clips from the original movie, but with different voice overs (with newly animated mouth movements).  But of course with Iron Man not having a visible mouth, they use a long running gag through-out the gag reel that Tony Stark runs and promotes his BBQ Rib joint.  You gotta see it to believe it!  Very funny stuff.

To conclude, if you're at all interested in seeing the first couple of Ultimate Avenger comic books brought to life through these two animated features, I highly suggest you pick these up.  If this was made into a long running weekly series, it'd surely give the excellent Justice League a run for its money.",1155168000,23,2281,4.593052109181142
2581553,4,B000FP2YYA,"This was a great second entry in the series.  If people are comparing it to the Justice League series, which I loved, I say it holds up very well.  You've got strong characters, good voice acting and I like this kind of animation much better than the old style animation that Justice League uses.

The special features were indeed special.  The segment on the Ultimates comic was very interesting, the DVD-ROM was enjoyable and the Gag Reel was hilarious! Great job guys.  At the price, a huge bargain!

2581554,3,B000FP2YYA,"This is the first animated movie Ive seen in a long time that uses mostly traditional animation. First off Id like to say its really enjoyable. It looks good and reminded me of the 80's GI Joe cartoon that I loved as a kid. It also has a great XMen style soundtrack.

It showed me a couple things. Here they are:

1. Captain America needs a real movie someday if he is like he appears in the Ultimate Avengers. Get rid of the old candy coated red white and blue and go with the man haunted by the nightmares of war and complexity of his past as he is in this film and it would work.

2. I loved the new Nick Fury. More like Samuel Jackson in XXX.

Better than the salt and pepper haired Reed Richards clone from the 60's.

3. Iron Man makes me want to see what they could do with him in live action. Billy Zane from Titanic would be a great Tony Stark.

4. Black Panthers right of passage to becoming King to his people is a strong back story, he was one of my favorite characters. Lastly it was great to see an animated Hulk where he belonged...in an animated movie. Hulk really shines maybe his appearance was a little late?

My complaints are small and few.

1. I didn't like the aliens. Tne invasion was WAY too ID4 or War of the Worlds for me. Ive seen it all before. You figure more contemporary characters would face more ""real world"" problems? I actually laughed a little because I thought also of the alien invasion in Chicken Little.

2. Thor is like a token blond in an old 80's rock video. No subtsance and as lame as he always was. At Hank Pims funeral he's still got his battle suit on and cracks jokes. It ended just in time.

Not a great film but fun to watch with the kids. Not really a whole lot for a nostalgic fan in his 30's. Worth at least one viewing for any Marvel fan. Im going to watch it again. After watching some old Fleisher Superman toons. As I said though it will go with the kids DVD's in my house.",1155168000,3,1931,4.125333333333334
2581555,5,B000FP2YYA,"I understand that this wipes away 40 years of history with the regular comic.  However it is a good film.  We didn't need the abusive Giant Man vs. the Wasp. It wasn't part of the larger picture.  Overall I'd have to say that style and poses must have been inspired by John Buscema's art.  I don't know if it's me just looking too close at the style; but it's more John Buscema than Kirby style figures in this one.

One major thing I didn't like was the Panther changing into the acutal animal.  It reminded me of somthing out of Thundercats!  The Panther is not an animal human. He only possess the power and strength. Another aspect that made him look like Wolveine were the claw gloves on his hand.  I knew the character had some type of claws built into his costume. However this one only copies Wolverine.  It doesn't take away from Panther though.  I still enjoyed this film much more than any cartoon Marvel produced.

I don't expect Batman/Justice League style of animation here.  The company is producing these on a much lower budget but the quality and characters are still there.  I can forgive the over airbushed tones in the comic like animation if the story is decent.  I can see the intent here. Producing an animated film that will appeal to young adults and long time True Belivers of the old school Marvel.  Well, if Marvel's Joey Q is reading this; keep on producing this DVD movie format.  I love them and can't wait for Dr. Strange and Iron Man!

My suggestion would to purchase the Target sponsered version with the CD Rom comic on Disc 2.  I think the CD and DVD comics are going to save the industry as we know it.",1155081600,2,1639,4.424749163879599
2581556,4,B000FP2YYA,"This is another great animated movie featuring the classic  comics of marvel.  I'm sure for hardcore fans that this may depart from the comic book lines, but the story that has evolved between these two features is pretty strong.  In this installment there a slight more character development, as we join thor, iron man, captain america, giant man, and the black panther in another battle against aliens trying to take over a small sepratist country for a meteorite that has been under their capital for decades.  This meteorite contains enough of a special energy compoud that would allow the aliens to take over the planet, and then some.  It is up to the avengers to help this country in their time of need, and show that the outside world can be trusted again.

  This is a very good animated film, better than some live action films.  Some of the limitations are the voice overs. They do not do justice to bruce banner or iron man, because they sound winey.  Also, the character of iron man is still a little thin also.  Also the movie is again only clocking in at about 69 minutes.

  However, thor shows is developed more, showing integrity, and so is giant man.  But most of all, the action is very good.  The fight scenes are suspensful, and are not restrained by physical limitations, and can be more believable in animation.  I recommend that anyone who like action, who likes hero's, and even comic book fans disgusted by the liberties done to the avenger storyline to sit back, and just enjoy this series of films as a separate, new story.

While Bruce Banner is heald in captivity by an evil scientist that sprays him with gas to calm him down to prevent him from turning into the Hulk. While Thor has a vision of the other Avengers dieing and must stop that from happening.

  What's impressive about the movie is that everyone has something to do and all the characters are well developed. While you know if they made a live action movie it would be a big mess and critics would probably hate it as much as the Fantastic Four. This is an entertaining and surprisingly often violent film. If they make another one I wouldn't mind it having an actual comic book villian though. This is good but enough with the alien attack plot.",1155081600,2,904,4.401197604790419
2581560,1,B000FP2YYA,"As I reviewed the first Ultimate Avengers, the same goes for the second installment... AND WORSE!  Simply put:  IT DOES NOT EVEN COMPARE TO QUALITY (BOTH IN WRITING AND ANIMATION) BOASTED BY WARNER BROS' The Batman, nor The Justice League! You'd think that Marvel would listen to their viewers and IMPROVE ON SO MANY FLAWS, only to be ignored and continue to FINISH THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT....FOR THE SECOND TIME!

  I love cartoons, I grew up watching and admiring their creators, and the process that they are brought to life.  I've seen the EVOLVEMENT of cartoons from the 1960's Captain America (and HULK), to the JOINT COLLABORATION of Americans and ANIME talents, to PRODUCE THE VERY-MUCH-HIGHLY-ACCLAIMED animation:  IGPX (you see people, american and japanese cartoon talents can actually compromise on their culture, and produce a REALLY GOOD SHOW!).  Given time and culture-change, from past to present, cartoons has improve in both dialogue and fluidity in animation!  So you can pretty much assume that a BIG COMIC cannon like MARVEL would carefully translate their VERY SUCCESSFUL 'ULTIMATES' comic series (which I have also read... credits to Joe Quesada on recruiting the great writer and comic illustrator for this) to A WELL THOUGHT-OUT, HIGH QUALITY, HIGH OCTANE ANIMATION!... much to the surprise of everyone, the FIRST ULTIMATE AVENGERS SUCKED!!!!  IT SUCKED BOTH ON WRITING, AND WORSE IN ANIMATION!

  To release the SEQUEL IN THE SAME INFERIOR ANIMATION AND WRITING GIBERISH by Marvel, is UTTER INSULT!  The story has more holes than a month-old molding piece of bread, the animation is a STRAIGHT CONTINUATION (not evolvement) of the style and technic done in the X-MEN cartoon series (not to be confused by X-MEN EVOLUTION, which was THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE ANIMATION as it was produced by a totally different creative team)!

  I have friends (that I advised to rent it first) regretting the experience, on LOSING ALMOST FIFTEEN BUCKS, after watching the first 20 minutes of the show!  Some don't even believe it's worth renting!  After watching the sequel with my 4-year old son... ALL I COULD DO IS SHAKE MY HEAD. I should've accepted the sign when he started playing his LEGOS, after the first 15 minutes of the show, but I gave it a chance.  All through the movie, he only glanced at the TV whenever there was some sort of VIOLENCE on the screen (already a bad sign)... but he never lost sight of his legos.  Now I put THE BATMAN or, THE JUSTICE LEAGUE series on the DVD player, and he's already on the couch with his pillowcase wrapped around his neck (as a cape) even before I push the PLAY BUTTON!  THIS BOY WAS MY THRILL INDICATOR, AND MY SON GOT BORED ON WATCHING ULTIMATE AVENGERS 2.  It's not worth buying, not even worth renting.  Yes, my opinion is harsh... but given MARVEL's capabilities... ""WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES"", and the Company FAILED THEIR AUDIENCE.... for the second time.",1154995200,9,2936,4.944897959183673
