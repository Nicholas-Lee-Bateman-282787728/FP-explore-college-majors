7920637,2,B00004R8UK,"I have had this video for some years and I always am disappointed by what it lacks. It starts out majestic and formidable with its keen fluted Yucatan like music and overlapping images. Luckily from early on the narrator manages to be stimulating and mesmerizing.
Still the beginning of the Journey takes us imediately around to giant sea otters certainly one of the more boring non-revealing aspects of the largely mysterious region a less attention grabbing selection for such a large wilderness area atleast in my view. To complete the picture the sea otters take a nice amount of time as well and even later return for a second glance. On to other subjects- before returning once again to the otters.
The fish featured in Journey.. are rather drab but a few selections are presented with memorable detail such as the Tiger fish or even one of the largest fish species in the Amazon Arrowana.
Piranhas were unimpacting even with their tenacious feeding habits. The segments on the fish were relatively thorough but I cant recall if they were ever filmed close enough and in much detail as I recall they were actually shown in brief instead. Most filming was on items the fish species ate or above water commotions. Still certain clarity and lighting make the Journey... difficult as there was no HD or Zoom back when this was produced and the momentum fluctuates with all that firstly.
 Numerous subjects such as Bullet ants, wandering spiders, Eciton ants, Tepuis, Angels Falls, Iguazu Falls, Machu Piccu, Screaming Piha bird and Argentine Tegu are all absent from the film. It's like those regions and animals have only ""since"" the production of this film become major trademarks of the region.
The two part series is nice but just not nearly up to par by BBC and more recent documentary standards. In that sense ""it"" went to sleep. Oh well-",1330387200,,1846,4.823343848580442
