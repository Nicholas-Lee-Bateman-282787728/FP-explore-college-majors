3730175,2,B001OFM2TC,"First- the plot isn't as unbelievable as it sounds- in fact yesterday there was a possible Ef1 tornado that struck 30 miles Se of Seattle in the towns of Buckley and Enumclaw. Not to far fom where i live. There have been a handful of funnel clouds and tornadoes reported in the Seattle area over the last few years. However this movies incorrect science(""catagory 4 twister"" its called by a socalled weather reporter- paperthin plot- flat acting and made for tv camerawork and drama makes this take on twister a dud. Any amateur weather spotter can pick apart this movie- especially the gigantic""supercell"" that looks and is in fact a hurricane sattelite image that was poorly computer generated. Perhaps the director should have actually hired weather experts to consult on this film so lead Mimi Rodgers doesnt come across as a complete idiot. There are some decent special efx's and destruction is always a good way to pass the time but wait for this on to go on tv for free . This movie does more harm to Seattle than any twister could!",1252281600,2,1040,4.688524590163935
3730176,1,B001OFM2TC,"I have nothing to say good about this movie except some decent effects. The movie goes from one twister to another, with some superimposed, fake plot that seems to appear from nowhere and disappear into the twister...sorry....not very good at sarcasm.  The acting is forced (and I really like Mimi R. usually).  Awful, awful movie. Wanna buy mine?",1245628800,5,347,4.9655172413793105

3730210,4,B001OFM2TC,"Never seen this movie before and overall, I was pleased with this movie. Oddly, it takes place in eastern Oklahoma and on this video/movie, it has mountains and not like the real Oklahoma has....so that seemed odd. The tornadoes they used in this movie seemed quite realistic compared to other movies I have viewed over the past few years, a plus in my eyes. The movie plot seemed okay and like I said, overall this movie was okay and pleased with it generally.",1385251200,7,461,4.566265060240964
3730211,5,B001OFM2TC,"i chose this 5 star rating, because it's a very good movie, there is no way that tornadoes can happen that quickly in seattle,  they may have storm warnings, but not tornados all the time lol.  i am being very honest about it ;)  i could understand about oklahoma, getting tornadoes, because it's very flat there lol.  the special effects are very cool.  i recommend this movie to everyone, that loves tornadoes :).  this one here is just as cool as the movie twister :).  i like this movie because it's interesting that the storm chasers know everything about chasing tornadoes, and saving lives :).",1379203200,,600,4.6571428571428575

3730213,4,B001OFM2TC,Package came before the due date and in excellent condition.  I am a sci fy b movie fan so I enjoyed it.  You have to be into Sci Fy and really into those B rated movies to enjoy it.,1372809600,3,182,3.641025641025641
3730214,4,B001OFM2TC,"After a massive tornado take the lives of her parents, April Saunders dedicates much of her life to studying tornadoes and to finding better weather systems to track them. On a trip to Seattle with her teenage daughter, she stumbles upon a supercell that begins to cause rare and forceful tornadoes in the area. When her daughter is caught in a dangerous twister, April must find a way to save her as well as an unprepared city from destruction.

You know, I've seen dozens and dozens of tornado movies since ""Twister"" came out back in 1996. While I have my personal favorites amongst them all, Storm Cell is one that sits right alongside the best of them. True, watching it- it looks like your garden variety tornado movie but what Storm Cell excels as a movie is in how the dynamic between mother and daughter actually is in the movie. It was quite believable to me. To me, that made the movie a step above other movies of this type.

Course, Storm Cell isn't without its' faults. People running around through flying debris without being hit is one thing. The ending is another thing, it didn't quite cut it for me.

If you don't look too closely to the science of tornadoes and twisters while watching this movie, Storm Cell is a great watch. I loved it myself.",1366675200,,1265,4.5394736842105265
3730215,3,B001OFM2TC,I liked the movie but the ending was kind of short.  It didn't quite wrap up the whole story line for me.,1366156800,,105,3.772727272727273

3730217,5,B001OFM2TC,I would recommend this to any who likes tornados and twisters same thing basically.it very action packed. I love it,1358726400,,115,4.8
3730218,5,B001OFM2TC,If you like disaster movies you'll like this movie. If you like tornados this movie will satiate your that desire.,1357344000,,114,4.75
3730219,2,B001OFM2TC,"Yes I like to watch no brainer films from time to time, but I do wish this movie had more original material. Too much like Twister, except for the special effects which were not great. I admit to really not caring what happened after a bit. I was ready for the storm to hit so the movie would be over. Yes I do have an off button, but I like to finish watching to give full opportunity for redemption. This one is a miss in my book, even if you just want to see a simple killer tornado movie. Not the worst, but nowhere near the best.",1356652800,,534,4.0
3730220,1,B001OFM2TC,Another waste of money screen stills says you can not view in this area.  Why are they for sale in England if you can't watch them.,1344816000,,131,4.038461538461538

3730222,4,B001OFM2TC,It's dramatic because of the tornadoes that occur along the storm cells in Seattle. I don't love it because that girl had a hard time with that boy. I can't remember their names.,1325548800,,178,4.424242424242424
3730223,4,B001OFM2TC,"Global warming is a hot subject! (excuse the pun) This time, twisters appear in an American state that has never had more than rain before. No-one is prepared for this disaster, but we just happen to have the 'Tornado Lady' visiting at this time!
Don't look too closely at the science, and it is an enjoyable movie, with some unexpected twists thrown in to try to make it more about humans than nature!",1323734400,14,402,4.52054794520548

3730226,5,B001OFM2TC,"I did not have a single problem in getting the merchandise ordered .. Amazon is the only logical place to order anything from as
they are ""secure"".  If a problem arises with anything ordered through them, it will be dealt with in a timely manner.  It's
wonderful when companies use Amazon to sell their wares because they have to live up to Amazon's standards.

I did not have any concerns .. the product arrived in grade A condition AND it arrived a little earlier than expected.",1313452800,,480,4.558139534883721
3730227,2,B001OFM2TC,"I took a chance on this movie because of Mimi Rogers and Michael Ironside, the subject matter, and the unreasonable hope that it would prove to be a movie I could add to my collection for future viewings.  Unfortunately, it didn't take long before I realized that wasn't going to happen.  First, Michael Ironside is barely in this movie (his part could have been played by anyone as his brief scenes were ""blink and you missed them."").  Second, Mimi Rogers' character is quite unlikable (as a mother or a storm chaser).  Her idiotic ""global warming"" rants straddle the line between glib and pathetically nave.  Alarmists might be amusing in comic supporting roles but not when they dominate the entire movie (complete with furrowed brow and way too many hysterical claims that are only borne out because they're written that way!).  The side issues that came up only served to make matters worse, not better.

(During the 50s, movies turned their worry about atomic bombs into killer mutant bugs and monsters.  Welcome to this generation's straw man: global warming, the catchall excuse for all weather related disaster movies.  I guess every generation has to have their boogeyman.)",1301961600,3,1183,4.994897959183674
3730228,5,B001OFM2TC,My wife and I enjoy watching storm or disaster moveies together. This was excellent movie if you are into this type of movie genre. Would highly recommend it.,1301270400,11,158,4.678571428571429
3730229,1,B001OFM2TC,"Where do I begin??? Well, let's start in Oklahoma, with lots of tall mountains. Yes, there are some low elevation mountains in OK near Lawton, and some even lower elevation ones in south central OK, but come on. I've been a Skywarn spotter for the National Weather Service since the early 70's and live in Kansas. I have an interest in movies about severe types of weather, so thought I'd give this one a try. Boy, was I mistaken. This is absolutely the worst movie of this type I've seen. I thought TWISTER! was bad, but this one makes it look really good.
Video of hurricanes (instead of tornadoes) and really poor special effects (most tornadoes don't shoot from the storm cell almost instantly to the ground). People running through flying debris in several instances was hard to take. Not realistic at all. Then the topper: (Spoiler warning)during the final tornado episode, with a large tornado approaching, people standing only a few feet away from the back door of a large house (when they could shelter in a basement), proceed to run out toward the tornado into a field and lie down! I couldn't believe a script writer would do such a thing...totally against any common sense! Anyway, this is a movie to skip, especially if you have any knowledge of real tornadoes. Very poorly done movie.",1299542400,15,1298,4.722466960352423
3730230,1,B001OFM2TC,Rental only - poor visual effects and sound. Sound is centered to front speakers - not true 5.1 as advertised. Story line had promise but got confused with sideline family issues and never really confronted the Storm Cell issue.,1295740800,2,228,4.871794871794871
