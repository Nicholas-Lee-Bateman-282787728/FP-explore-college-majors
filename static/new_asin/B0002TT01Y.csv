His car has been stolen and he drives around in a taxi and spots his stolen car and that is when he is taken hostage by the gangsters,  a police shoot out then follows during which quite a few policemen are killed.  His girlfriend tries to get help from the police but they can't be bothered thinking the guy has actually been kidnapped they think he is one of the gangsters and refuse to believe otherwise.  What follows is a taut movie as the nurse's girlfriend tries to find him on her own. This movie was able to keep my interest throughout and was a movie I would recommend although it seems to be not a well known movie in the west.  I will say there are some holes in the plot and the gangsters are a bit stereotypical. Is it THE best crime drama ever? NO but it was entertaining and I enjoyed it and give it 3.5 stars. It's worth a watch.",1335571200,,957,4.129032258064516
8031686,5,B0002TT01Y,"I really liked this film. I highly recommend it to all viewers. The film centers arround the character Eason (Eason Chan) who along with his wife Niki (Niki Chow) are about to travel from Hong Kong to Europe on a vacation. They both have been stressed out in their lives, and in an attempt to rekindle their love for each other, decide to drop everything they are doing and go to France and rediscover their love for each other.

However, something bad is about to happen. Eason is kidnapped by a gang of criminals who belong to a Chinese triad. They are ruthless and do not hesitate to kill anyone in their way. With one of their comrades seriously wounded, they take Eason prisoner, telling him that as long as he saves the life of their comrade he will remain alive. Eason is a medical practioner, and knows the wounds of his new patient are serious and he will not live if he does not see a doctor.

The police are also after Eason [including a good friend of his on the police force] when it is discovered that Eason is with this Chinese gang. He was with them when they ambushed and killed several policemen. And even though his wife and friends try and convince the police that he has been abducted, they don't want to hear about it. As far as the police are concerned, he is with them, and therefore guilty. The wife, Niki has a cell phone type tracking device, and she is in communication with her husband, abeit covertly. The film is very good, and I highly recommend it.",1165104000,,1481,4.401459854014599
