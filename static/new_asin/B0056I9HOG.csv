4588620,4,B0056I9HOG,Enjoyable and for this series this was specific on UFOs and where the focus was in past years for commerical TV,1391299200,3,111,4.333333333333333
4588621,5,B0056I9HOG,A good collection from Unsolved Mysteries.  Brings together the highlights from all the UFO episodes that were aired.  Well done.,1390435200,,129,5.4
4588622,5,B0056I9HOG,"This is the best of the UFP unsolved mysteries. Covers everything from Area 51, Roswell incident, Kecksburg Pa crash, and many others. I highly recommend this set.",1376784000,,163,5.074074074074074
4588623,5,B0056I9HOG,Very well designed DVD. As spooky as I remember. And yes it has the intro theme. All the segments were chosen based on strength of validity.,1374710400,,140,4.423076923076923
4588624,5,B0056I9HOG,"An excellent series, hosted by equally excellent Robert Stack.  Stack doesn't pooh-pooh the believers, but isn't a gullible believer either.  He takes the sensible middle ground: at 200 light years from Earth the nearest place aliens could come from is far too far away for living creatures to ever reach us; yet there are thousands of people who believe they have seen aliens, and this is too many to believe they are all lying!",1369612800,10,429,4.783783783783784
4588625,3,B0056I9HOG,"I loved the original Unsolved Mysteries series with Robert Stack, and I was excited about this collection.  However (and totally my fault), I shouldn't have spent the money on these two DVDs.  I realized I had already seen all these episodes several times (duh!), and I ended up stopping each one and moving on to the next - only to realize I'd seen that one too.  I ended up watching ONE episode all the way through, but it wasn't worth the cost. Awesome show though.  Love that creepy intro music, and there will never be another Robert Stack.",1361750400,13,545,4.530612244897959
4588626,5,B0056I9HOG,I enjoy the docamentry..It was very enjoying to watch...In fact a friend went to your site that loves unsolved mysteries and ordered all of them since I bought mine here...He had been looking for them..Now he has them too...,1354838400,4,224,4.769230769230769
8459649,5,B0056I9HOG,Very happy with this purchased. I love unsolved mysteries. I wish they'd release more.,1481932800,,86,5.214285714285714
8459650,5,B0056I9HOG,very entertaining!,1468800000,,18,8.5
8459651,5,B0056I9HOG,"Excellent. I wish they'd re-issue this DVD series again.  Purchased this Feb 26 2016, fast service, discs were in excellent condition.",1458950400,,134,5.380952380952381
8459652,3,B0056I9HOG,"Loved the DVD set, but the sound is terrible.  The background sound is overpowering making it almost impossible to hear the host's narration during a good part of the show.  I would have given it only 1 star, but the content of the dvds was great.  The content would have gotten 5 stars.  So I compromised at 3 stars.",1451260800,3,317,4.322033898305085
8459653,5,B0056I9HOG,I miss this show and Bob Stack too! They don't make them like that any more!,1443916800,,76,3.8125
8459654,5,B0056I9HOG,Oh! man where do I began this is just a great collection of UFO's from the Unsolved Mysteries.,1437350400,,94,4.277777777777778
8459655,5,B0056I9HOG,A host of interesting and some truly terrifying stories.  UM always found the best cases with shocking twists. This set is awesome and includes the Roswell story in great detail. The Allagash Abductions case is chilling. The rest are very solid also and one case with a guy who sill has marks from an apparent ufo that burned him. Robert Stack is a legend and made the series simply amazing with his tone and voice. Not sure if this set is the entire 4 disc set that I have seen. Note: If your looking for UM sets like this or never released dvd's go to ioffer.com. I bought a 15 disc set for $25. They are poor tv quaility rips but well worth it if your an UM buff.,1429056000,2,666,4.162790697674419

8459658,5,B0056I9HOG,If you like unsolved mysteries this is a good set to get. It has a few episodes that are on the best of unsolved mysteries but I still give it 5 stars,1408665600,3,150,3.71875
