8058862,5,B0009AHZ7M,"One of my favorite movies as a kid.  It's was on ""The Million Dollar Movie"" in Los Angeles back in the late 50's.  The played it every night  of the week and also during the day on weekends.  Watched it almost every showing.  I have a copy off of cable but would love to have a remastered copy as the location shots are beautiful.  It was shot in color and the Canadian scenery is captured beautifully.  Joan Leslie is just beautiful.  Just a fun film.",1483920000,,452,4.235294117647059
