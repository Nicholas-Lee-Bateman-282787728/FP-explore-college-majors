7037418,5,B00UGPQXFA,I don't understand why the second reviewer made it sound like this is the last show. My personal feelings are that I'm hoping that this show will continue to grow.,1308096000,5,163,4.466666666666667
7037419,2,B00UGPQXFA,"This show was a disaster from the very beginning. I don't really blame the cast but they were mediocre. The writing was just dreadful. This show felt thrown together over a weekend by middle school kids. Thankfully, it's the only season.",1307059200,13,237,4.804878048780488

7037433,1,B00UGPQXFA,"It is really amazing how bad this series is in all categories-directing, acting, script writing, originality, etc. I would have to say that it ranks near the top of the most unrealistic crime dramas I have ever seen. The biggest problem is taking a complicated crime scene, finding the clues/evidence/motive, solving it, and finding/capturing the criminal in the space of 40 minutes. There is no drama as everything happens so fast. Then there are the ridiculous scenarios-for example,a school busdriver going down the street on the wrong side of a double yellow line, bomb timer shows 2 seconds as 2 FBI agents get off the bus and are 30 feet away when it goes off, suspect couldn't be responsible for bomb that went off in the hallway as he was in detention and yet other bombs are going off with timers, etc.",1512432000,,811,4.71830985915493
7037434,5,B00UGPQXFA,"This show is great entertainment for fans , although some episodes do deal with rather dark subject matter, and of course loss of life. But there are also a lot of really good moral lessons that are also missing from many shows, especially over the last decade or so.",1498867200,,267,4.469387755102041

7037436,2,B00UGPQXFA,Could only watch 30 minutes of the first episode as the acting was terrible! It may get better with time but I am not willing to waste the time when there are so many good series to watch.,1490832000,,188,3.973684210526316

7037439,3,B00UGPQXFA,"Good acting, but sloppy detective procedure.  They talk to the press when they should not.  They stake out in front of houses and buildings without covering the back.  The outcome is usually predictable as are the prime suspects.",1488067200,,229,4.973684210526316

7037463,5,B00UGPQXFA,"Criminal Minds-Suspect Behavior has created a less rigid, and sometimes, more effective way to approach a suspect. The FBI comes down to their level, in order to help themselves,know, what's going on in the heads of these killers. Suspects are less intimidated by law enforcement, when approached in a manner of respect, without fearing being judged before a trial. The teams wardrope is so appropriate, a foretelling of understanding and trust, is seen by the suspect. Feeling that they can be understood by the FBI, they are therefore more forthcoming of true events. All three Criminal Minds shows, have a specialty that they excel at. Being able to compare and contrast the differences, and how to use it to write an Even better season next time around would be a real value to your audience. I'd just like to congratulate all the writers on how well they did when new characters arrived at the BAU and they were able to make Them fit right in without any hiccups. The actors to be chosen to be part of the team, was obviously done with a lot of thought and planning. Each person, that has been accepted are a complement to the team. I would love to be a fly on a wall while they are rehearsing. Then we will know who they really are.",1484784000,,1238,4.556053811659193
7037464,4,B00UGPQXFA,"I've only seen this show couple of times, good story line. I've always liked Forest Whicker, he's great in every show I've seen.",1484697600,,128,4.608695652173913
7037465,5,B00UGPQXFA,Great show,1484697600,,10,4.5
7037466,4,B00UGPQXFA,"Actually, this is a really good show.  People have all sorts of opinions as it's hard not to compare this with the original.  But while it's understandable to be critical, I like everything about this series.  When the show is being shoe-horned into the Criminal Minds Quantico formula, it suffers.  But there are glimpses in every episode and some (nearly) entire episodes that the casts' personality and chemistry shine.  I am certain that another season would have allowed time for the writers and actors to develop their characters.  If that had happened, it would have been another hit.

I recommend this to anyone who likes the original Criminal Minds series.  You'll really enjoy it.  Just watch it with an open mind.",1484697600,4,724,4.917355371900826

7037495,2,B00UGPQXFA,"I'm s HUGE Criminal Minds fan, I've watched it two times through and am on my third time while simultaneously watching the new season.  To keep it short, I quite love the show.  When first watching the episode with Forest Whittaker, it was amazing and fun to to see two teams working together (plus, the man is an amazing actor).  Unfortunately, in the new show, the addition of the brunette was a bad idea.  I'm sure she's a nice person, but she cannot act.  The supporting actors (victims) have less then stellar acting capabilities as well.  In addition, we loved the ex-convict in Criminal Minds because of his insights into prison, mirroring David Rossi very well.  For some reason, the writers seemed to change his behavior into a hater of the suspects, rather than savior of the victims.  Though this does suit a convict turning his life around (hating himself and others who remind him of his past), it does not follow he original character introduced in Criminal Minds.  It seems the writers changed a good thing, and in turn, added some flaws that distract from the story and characters' personalities.  Lastly, they also made it as though the team doesn't quite understand criminals as they should, like in the original Criminal Minds.  I will watch another episode in hopes that I am wrong, but I have a feeling I'm right.",1482796800,,1334,4.731601731601732

After all, look at the superlative cast, headed most ably by the gifted & Oscar-winning Actor, FOREST  WHITAKER!  I'd have to look up the other cast names at present because I wasn't familiar with them.

Their hq is a dump. Just because they are a 'red cell' team they have to have the worst hq? Also, every time i watch forest he reminds me of william petersen in 'manhunter'. He does not come close to petersen's graham.  He tries to get into  the head of the bad guy(s) but i am not sold. He should have tried a different track.",1476662400,,490,4.041237113402062

7037594,4,B00UGPQXFA,Nothing earthshaking but this series hangs together with a smooth progression from one episode to another.

7037717,4,B00UGPQXFA,"Good spin off, but not as good as the original. I love Forest Whitaker and Jeanine Garofalo but don't know the rest. They all seemed to be good actors, but their interactions seemed awkward. Sometimes they would talk so slowly that I'll be saying come on talk. Also, the fight scenes (training with the wooden sticks) could have been better. Despite these small things, this show was good and should have had at least a second season.",1469750400,3,434,4.64935064935065

7037804,3,B00UGPQXFA,"This series is more about the psycho criminals. The characters openly discuss about the how the psycho's mid must have worked. On many occasion it seems contrived. Then we have computer lady who can see any document, like your mark sheets from school, on her computer, or a secret love letter that wrote to someone twenty years back. Sounds ridiculous. But something is always taking place with few unexpected turns. The killer is always found when he or she is about to kill the last victim.

7037891,3,B00UGPQXFA,"The actors within are grand. The scripting - not so much. After, apparently, being spoiled on the original criminal minds and again any show or movie having to do with these main character actors, I am left unrewarded by the lack of depth and investment I have come to expect from such high class actors. Borrowing from the original show has not helped. The chemistry is not there and it is as if each actor is rehearsing alone then acting separately from one another. The interactions are bland most of the time.
 A situation with inflammatory sound or music soon becomes a boring left over instead of a well seasoned scene. Every one of these actors is capable of so much more. I must blame the lack of interaction and caring on the directors inability to see the better scenes and are leaving said best scenes in the digital trashcan.
Instead of getting the intended impression of a new team coming together and learning the ropes, I watch, sometimes in anguish, as blurted-out, IL-timed lines are cast at the audience in the hope that no one will notice the attempt at cohesion being completely missed.
I really like these actors. Yup all of them - individually - are great. Unfortunately they are filmed like a rag tag bunch of miscreants out for tea - not justice, and seemingly care only enough to get paid. That is poor editing and poor vision on the producers part. I would never waste such talent as is available here; somehow that truth has been ignored by the people who put this show together.",1459209600,8,1506,4.598513011152416

7037962,5,B00UGPQXFA,"I love the show!  Forest Whitacker is an under rated actor that, to me,  is natural in each episode. Janeane Garofolo ( spelling maybe incorrect, sorry...) is not acting - not in episodes 1&2, but delivering the lines as she,  or her character, should. Sometimes, she takes the time to think - and that is when the Doctor explodes on the screen.  I do not like a lot or dialog on the screen - I do like some dialog aimed at establishing where we are in the moment (as the next actor prepares to project their anguish.  So far, Mark Gordon, Thank you.

Further, if you looked around the campus, I am sure, you would find something that is not  written as perhaps you would have directed it to be written.

They pull in a big name like Forest Whitaker, and a familiar character like Penelope but, nope its not working The acting is so overly dramatic that it overshadows the issues of why the team is drawn to these murders in the first place. And every member of the team has WAY too many issues that make it even likely they would pass a standard psych evaluation, much less work for the F.B.I.  I mean, I understand character development but why do we even need this special kind of team?  I watched an episode where this show and Criminal Minds crossover--Hotchner getting help from Coop. It was interesting but not enough to warrant a whole new breed or sector within the B.A.U.  I wanted to like this... I never say this about most shows, but I'm glad they let this go.

She is one of my all time favorite characters of the Criminal mind series so I was so thrilled that they brought her back in this Criminal Mind Suspect Behavior series.

They both seem to do the same profiling and work on very similar cases. I was sad to see it end so abruptly, but that's just because I like Criminal Minds. I also can't say there was one particular agent I really liked on this team with the exception of the cyber chic, but she's on the other show as well so no big deal for her in my mind.",1439596800,,470,4.064516129032258

7038162,4,B00UGPQXFA,"I really like criminal minds and how they focus on the criminals and their behavior. In terms of this show and the season there are a few script issues that bother me while I was watching all 13 episodes this weekend.

1st off there is not a deep connection made between the viewer and the characters of the show. Now I person would have love to have seen more but there should of been more focus put in this department.

2nd the crimes or the main plots of the show didn't feel as intense as the original criminal minds show but I will admit there was a wide variety of them.

Overall I wish more would come from this show but it was cancelled and I can see why. But in reality I feel they can fix this issue if given the opportunity and funding to continue this show.

Don't get your hopes up too high but this is still a good show and the acting and effects were really done well. The plots were ok and the character development needs/needed work on. This is a good show if you over look those facts. Hope this helped in some way.",1438473600,,1033,4.15

I thought that episode with both teams was great and worthy of the split, however the red cell group just did not provide the chemistry as the combined group. I can say I did like the season ending cliff hanger a lot, however I won't be buying the second season. Maybe it gets better and maybe not, someone will have to give me the second season as a gift I won't purchase it.

I thought this would have been a great opportunity to watch this show on the off-season of the original. I was very disappointed to watch a whole season with no second season in sight (I understand more of what the comments meant). Maybe Amazon should think about picking up the story line, call it Suspect Behavior, and develop the characters background (which was missing from the first season) so people can learn why they are who they are and how they came to work with each other. A lot of unanswered questions but has potential to be a good to great series. I gave it three stars because I did like it.

7038586,5,B00UGPQXFA,"This is a very different Criminal Minds. This show never really had a chance to develop into the hit it was meant to be. I admit, it wasn't the Criminal Minds we grew to love, but then it was after all a spinoff. A spinoff that never really had the chance it needed to be a success. The shows were just as dark as the original show and just as compelling. Sure, there was no Rossi, but there were others to take this show into it's success. Forest Whitaker was a perfect choice for this show and yet they cancelled it too soon. The only person who stayed in both shows was Penelope Garcia, she was less flippant and somewhat more subdued in this show but she too was starting to sound like the Garcia we all loved. True the show took some getting used to, but don't all spinoff's?

It's a great show, buy it. You will enjoy it. I know I did.",1416009600,8,841,4.128048780487805

7038588,1,B00UGPQXFA,"Worst ""Criminal Series"" EVER!!!

What mades Criminal Minds a well acclaimed series is the attention to details at all the time. In this amateur try, the criminal minds team, -wich as all of you already know is a FBI, special unit- which means that they can only act when there exist federal jurisdiction, or when the state jurisdiction ask for their intervention, but, they show up for regular murders, abductions, even without being called, or without knowing or even suspecting that there is a serial criminal, Come on!!!!

When you work for the FBI, you do not dress like they do... watch the picture, looks like if Forest is soliciting to Thomas Gibson, When you see Forest, as the leader of the unit, wearing this horrendous clothes, no way. Poor direction, poor trigger, poor attention to detail, its an EPIC FAIL.",1415923200,6,820,4.808510638297872

In CM spin-off, ""CM, Suspect Behavior"" Forest Whitaker makes a credible if brooding portrayal of a lead FBI profiler. His team is clearly the ""B"" team compared to the original. For example. they drive to the locations instead of flying on a Gulfstream private jet. The supporting cast is adequate if not special. The story lines  are a bit less complex overall and the tone is rather dark. I stopped viewing after Episode, a bright point where the team rescued a stolen baby at the end.

7038725,5,B00UGPQXFA,"the season finale of this cancelled show is truly a cliffhanger - an impossible situation to escape from really.

I really like many of these episodes while being neutral about the rest.  I didn't expect it to be anything like the mother ship BUT I am also not one of the longtime audience members who cares at all about the characters of the mother ship team.  I'm all about the unsub and the ones here are awful - like the new Hannibal show on NBC.

Also, I don't give too much thought to the team members like Forrest Whitaker who seems to have enraged some longtime fans of the mothership by being very un MIB.  I don't really mind him unless he and Janeane Garafolo have a really funny scene together.

I really enjoy this show so much without commercials so if you can check it out for free - do so.

ETA:  rewatching it on netflix, this show is a comedy gem albeit a bittersweet one - there's something VERY VERY VERY STRANGE about Forrest Whitaker's character.  I find myself wanting to titter at most of his lines  - everyone is just background noise except when Janeane Garafolo plays straight man to him.

I own the ""He wants you to smell the bed."" episode which also shouts out to The Walking Dead with the HORSE.

Very weird - it's amazing that CBS paid for an entire season based on FW's nunchak, krav maga I forget what caporeira scene in the mothership.",1368662400,,1369,4.388888888888889

I could go into how each actor/actress tried to stretch their piece of dialogue into something poignant and meaningful, but I would write pages of utter failure.  At one point I thought I was watching the overacting of CSI: Miami cast impersonating a Criminal Minds episode.  It sucks that they dragged the character of Penelope into this, but actresses got to eat too, I suppose.

If you're thinking of buying this because you also loved Criminal Minds, do yourself a favor and give this one a pass.  It'll probably be free on Prime or Hulu or Netflix soon enough that you can gag on how bad it is then...for ""free.""",1368489600,7,869,4.415094339622642

This show will keep your attention. This show will have you on the edge of your seats.. Our family thinks this show is better than many of the criminal shows currently on T.V..

We were searching Netflix for the original Criminal Minds show and came across this one.. We were glad we did.. We plan to add this one to our collections.

We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch. This show makes for some great T.V.

Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows. This show will not disappoint. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. We will add this show to our collections so that we can view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many will like this show!

Anyway, our family loves this show and we are glad that we were still able to find this show on Netflix and Amazon. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo, Animal plant etc.. Any way, if you want action and criminal drama this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show and Touched by an Angel since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

Happy viewing! Can't wait until this show is back. We need real T.V. to come back.. We will not pay for paid for T.V. with all of the trash that is on it.

We will update once we purchase our DVD set of this series...

Enjoy!",1345507200,,2095,3.992822966507177

They need to realize that it's their audience of viewers that make or break a show and not how deep they can pack their pocket with cash!,1337990400,22,413,3.9285714285714284
7038749,3,B00UGPQXFA,"I'm a big fan of procedural crime dramas, to include the parent series ""Criminal Minds"".  I'm also a fan of Forrest Whitaker and Janeane Garofalo, so I dove into Suspect Behavior with some anticipation.  The premise of the spinoff centers around a ""Red Cell"" of the Behavior Analysis Unit of the FBI, this cell reporting directly to the FBI director, and used for rapid response cases.  Truthfully, I'm not even sure such Red Cells exist, but it's not the worst spinoff series start point I've ever heard (Galactica 1980, Joanie Loves Chachi).  Given the narrow focus of the parent series though, the creators may have painted themselves into a corner with an even more restrictive subset of material.  They do manage several episodes with plots that are believably the purview of a Red Cell, though most have you asking ""Why isn't the BAU handling this?""

Execution over the thirteen episodes is mixed.  The writers, directors and actors take several episodes finding their footing with their characters, and the result is staccato, hesitant delivery of forced dialogue.  Tim Matheson does a good job directing a later episode (on par with his work on Burn Notice), and in general by the second half of the season everybody seems to start finding their sea legs.  The core ensemble is interacting with each other like actual co-workers, and even smiling from time to time.

Characters themselves are more eccentric than the parent series, again befitting the Red Cell premise.  'Prophet' is an ex-con and provides a viewpoint from the other side of Law Enforcement, Mick is a former SAS sniper (though the writers' stereotypical handling of the character shows that Hollywood doesn't really know what snipers actually do...they're not ""cold, calculating lone-wolves who shun teamwork""), Sam (Forrest Whitaker) is the introspective team leader with a mysterious past (mostly unexplored prior to the series cancellation), Gina a ""daddy's girl"" out to prove herself, and Beth (Janeane Garofalo) as the cynical, outspoken career federal worker out to do her job regardless of how many toes she steps on.

Regarding Garofalo, I'm a fan of her standup and her acting, and I'm a Republican.  My fandom notwithstanding, Garofalo's acting has, to paraphrase Dennis Miller, ""about as much range as a Daisy air-rifle.""  She's cynical, opinionated, unapologetic and quick-witted.  She'll never be cast as a ditz, a redneck or a militant action hero.  As an intelligent, skilled government employee who's been bounced from office to office due to her abrasiveness though, she's a perfect casting fit.  I've worked with folks just like her.  Once the writers and directors start giving her a bit of leash halfway through the season, her character starts emerging, bringing more humanity to the team.

Forrest Whitaker too takes a few episodes to find his character.  Early episodes have him delivering lines staccato, with more nervous ticks than a Lyme Disease research lab (thanks to Big Bang Theory for that line).  His personal demons are only hinted at, left to be explored in subsequent (cancelled) seasons.  He's a great actor, let down by poor writing, direction, and I suspect a lack of support from the suits.

This series was limited in its premise, and I think the producers and creators paid less attention to their technical advisors, falling back more on their own knowledge base of TV tropes.  That hurts the believability at times (at one point the FBI director tries to accompany the team on a house raid...can you picture Louis Freeh kicking in a crime scene door, weapon drawn?) and pulls the series away from its procedural roots.  The writing, directing and acting are also rather directionless as a result, though the crew does start finding its way in the latter half of the series.  Given another season, with perhaps a shake-up of bodies behind the camera, this series might have gone somewhere.  As it is, there are a few bright moments in here, but also a lot of rough.",1337472000,4,3984,5.015197568389058
7038750,1,B00UGPQXFA,"A coworker, who knew I enjoyed the original series, loaned me this spinoff to view. He didn't comment too much about it at the time, and now I know why. One word describes this package, ""appalling.""

At times, it almost seems like this is supposed to be a parody of the original. Garofalo manages to consistently sap anything worthwhile out of any scene she appears in; I don't know who told her she can act, but they lied to her. The scripts are weak, and the direction is inconsistent. If someone hadn't seen the original, they certainly wouldn't want to bother after seeing this mess. There is precious little, here, to recommend spending your cash on, or even sacrificing shelf-space for. Avoid this if at all possible.",1332288000,5,723,4.692913385826771
7038751,3,B00UGPQXFA,"It seems that successful TV series always must result in spin off series trying to capture the same genie in a bottle that the original did. It works on occasion, but then sometimes it doesn't. CRIMINAL MINDS: SUSPECT BEHAVIOR kind of falls in the middle.

The series follows a special unit of the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) of the FBI, but not quite like the team in the original series. This team is called a Red Cell, a special group put together by the head of the FBI to be a rapid response team of agents and civilians alike that will try and solve crimes that have begun before they escalate into something more heinous.

The team is led by Special Agent Sam Cooper (Forest Whitaker), a dogged leader whose goal is to take out the bad guys at all costs but as peacefully as possible. Cooper is a genius when it comes to putting together the facts he sees, those his team gathers, and sifting through them to get to the clue needed to capture the unsub (unknown subject).

The team Cooper has pulled together comes from various sources, partly because of his penchant for not wanting to deal with bureaucrats and partly because (my guess) the network wanted to include as many diverse people as possible in this series. In some cases it works, in others not so much.

Cooper's right hand is Beth Cooper (Janeane Garofalo), a much subdued agent with what appears to be a highly pessimistic attitude. Ex-British Special Forces agent Mick Rawson (Matt Ryan) is a weapons expert and the teams good looking guy to get women to watch. Jonathan Simms (Michael Kelly) is an ex-on trying to redeem himself by putting other criminals away. Gina LaSalle (Beau Garrett) is the heart of the team, the conscience if you will. And rounding out the team from home base is Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) of the original series doing the same here for this team as that one, finding info via computer to help them along.

As with the original series, this team targets criminals whose crimes are serial in nature but not always murder. Episodes range from kidnappers to murderers to bombers. In each case, the team uses their expertise to put together a profile of the killer, to delve into their mind and discover what it is that makes them tick in an effort to catch and stop them before others are harmed.

It would seem that this would make for a show that was worth adding to your DVR list if not outright owning given the popularity and excellence of the original show, right? But I'm not quite sure. Watching this initial season of the series, taking it all in, I can't quite decide if I love it, hate it or am just indifferent to it. But then again it might just be due to growing pains that all shows have in their first season. Rare is the case when a series clicks from the first episode.

So what works? The stories. The idea that these criminals are out there and that a team has been comprised that will meet them on their own ground and do everything in their power to stop them.

What doesn't? To begin with Whitaker needs to be let lose. He's a fantastic actor but his character here is far too subdued. We need to know more about Cooper, to see him let lose more often. Garofalo just seems to drift through. Her character seems like her real life personality, that of someone dissatisfied with everything determined to bring down the rest of the party. Watching her all I can see here is the cartoon character Daria brought to real life.

But perhaps the one thing missing here that the original series has is that sense of family between the characters. Maybe that's something that will develop as the series progresses. But if it doesn't happen soon it may never get the chance to. In reading reviews online at IMDB it appears that most aren't all that favorable. But I think in terms of viewers many are like me, sitting and waiting to see what happens.

As an initial season this one will hold your interest from start to finish. If you love the original series, you'll want to compare the two, but do that keeping in mind this is not the same show. It's different. It comes from a different angle. It may become something better than it's beginnings show and maybe not. Only time will tell. Until then we'll have an early start here that we'll be able to compare it to one day. And more stories of unsubs on the lose and being caught.",1332201600,4,4354,4.5

7038753,3,B00UGPQXFA,Ok. I liked the show. I really like the lead actor and admire a lot of his work. However Criminal Minds has been here long enough to establish itself. It has had character moves and yet the ensemble has survived. It doesn't need another show doing the same thing and doing it not nearly as well. There were just way too many comparisons to the original and the original stands alone in my mind...this show doesn't have the weight or the strength that Criminal Minds had coming out of the gate.  They broke the mold with the original one and all the rest...at least this one...is just a copy and a fuzzy one at that. Sorry.,1327276800,2,622,4.362068965517241
7038774,1,B00UGPQXFA,"I am a big fan of the original show.  (I own almost all the DVD collections.)  My only major objection is their absurd handling of key female characters.  (Why mess with success?)

So I was really interested in this spinoff . . . I really wanted to like it.  I really tried to like it.  Believe me, I don't usually give TV shows this much effort.  Therefore, I was genuinely surprised at what a disappointment this was.  Eventually, my biggest hope was that it would be cancelled before it started dragging down the reputation of the original.

As I see it, there were two major problems, and they both result from this attempting to be a spinoff of the original.  First, the very premise for whole show was weak at best.  Why would a ""team"" like this be needed?  Most of the cases it dealt with could be just as easily handled by decent local authorities or already existing special forces, such as SWAT teams.  If it gets more complicated than that, you call in the REAL Criminal Minds crew.  I just could never believe that this group would even exist.

Second, if this group DID exist, why would THESE people be on it?  Most of them seem so flawed, personally and/or professionally, that it is hard to believe they would have a job in law enforcement at all, let alone as part of some sort of elite force.  Contrast that with the original Criminal Minds group in which the vast majority of characters seem eminently qualified at both a professional and personal level.  In their case, their flaws make them more believable and interesting; the flaws don't define them as they do in this spinoff.

The bottom line: this seems like a story of a pretty week junior varsity group with one character from the original series tossed in occasionally to give it a shred of credibility.  If you want entertainment, I think you'll enjoy re-watching episodes from the original series much more.",1326412800,17,1887,4.592814371257485

7038780,2,B00UGPQXFA,"I'm a fan of the original CM, and I watched CM:SB with an open mind.  There are some clear reasons this show tanked, and several of them have nothing to do with the show.

1) It was thought by uberfans and whispered across the Internet that the reason for A.J. Cook's and Paget Brewster's unfortunate exit from the original show was to free up budget to create this show.  There could not possibly have been a *worse* PR move.  Once this show was linked to their axing, this show had no chance; the built-in fan base hated it from the getgo.

2) If you want to see how conservatives cannot even watch an outspoken liberal *actor*, go read comments on Janeane Garofalo's IMDB page.  It's appalling.  A number of people apparently decided they wouldn't watch it because she's on it, and she has made her political views known.  In protest, I will stop watching CSI:NY because Gary Sinese, an outspoken conservative actor is on it.  Oh, wait, no--I won't, because I can separate a character from an actor.  At any rate, some people refused to watch it because of Garofalo's politics--shamefully.

3) Given those two factors, it didn't help that this was a typical first season of a show: awkward, ungainly, poorly paced.  I believe the show would've found its footing after this season, but this season was almost as bad as everyone says it was.  Sadly, the time spent setting up the characters (a bit tediously) wouldn't have been needed in the next season, and they could've focused more on group cohesion, relationships, and of course, the cases.  But they won't get that chance.

4) If you haven't watched this, don't--for one crucial reason.  It ends on a VERY BAD cliffhanger--as in, you don't know if one of the main characters just died, and it seemed that this individual may well have been dead.  Were they *that* sure they'd be renewed?  Ugh.  I don't like cliffhangers at the end of *seasons*.  Cliffhangers at the end of *series* are ten times worse.  Boo.  Note to Hollywood: don't cliffhanger the end of a dead show.  It's rude to those who *did* watch it.

5) This is a small point, and I've not seen it made anywhere else, but the show was ugly: all greys and browns, dingy and unkempt.  The office sets the tone for the show, and while I understand they were trying to make this team look ""edgy"" and ""street smart"" and even a bit rogue, it didn't work.  They just looked sloppy.  This kind of noir look permeated the series, but it didn't fit.  Sorry, but FBI agents need to look professional when they go out to local police.  What local police officers would trust slovenly FBI?",1316304000,10,2595,4.592592592592593
7038781,1,B00UGPQXFA,"On paper it sounded great: a Criminal Minds spin-off with a creepy Oscar winner at the lead, and a very decent cast of good actors.
The real thing was appalling.
At first it was difficult to pin out if the problem was script or acting. Finally I would settle for the cardboard screenplay and poor direction.
When the CRIMINAL MINDS series is about intelligent set-ups, subtle dialogue, and careful but realistic environments, the spin-off entered with characters out of a comic book, from the sweaty profiler done by Whitaker, always with a careful clad ""underground"" getup, to his co-workers, the guy with the cutout gloves, the girl with the laptop, and their need to repeat every clue out loud as if they needed to make a point that we should listen.
On the pilot it was a blue van, when the kid witness is ""persuaded"" by Whitaker to remember what happened, he says ""a blue van"". Then we get the flashback to se the van. Then every member of the team repeats the word as if a mantra just to establish that is a ""good"" clue.
Dialogue needs serious work here, and so is delivery, which end up like posing and speaking.
No suspense, no way to relate to the inner team's stories, which seem forced at the most.
A must skip.",1316044800,44,1222,4.509009009009009
7038782,5,B00UGPQXFA,"This spin off of the acclaimed Criminal Minds series is just as strong, interesting and powerful as the original. The only complaint this fan has is it ended way to soon! And on a ""What happened?"" Note that will probably never be answered. Each character had great potential and the chemistry between actors left you wanting more. The extras are for technical fans: those who like the ""why"" behind a show. The deleted scenes are self-explanatory why they were cut, but the alternative way ""Beth"" (Janeane Garofalo) was introduced to the team was less shocking than having her all of the sudden show up like she does in the first episode. Forest Whitaker is great as ""Sam"" a person struggling with his faith, demons and the horrors he sees every day. Michael Kelly (""Prophet"") could have been developed more, but what you see is **very** nice! Would love to have explored the why he was how he was.  Also, Matt Ryan (""Mick"")never fully gets to explore his character....wonderful nuggets of information into his personality and background tease. The only gray spot is Beau Garrett (""Gina""). While, a lovely actress, her character is flat and seems to add nothing to the show. Please Criminal Minds writers: bring this show back, and if you don't, please do another cross over show like the introduction episode (also found on disc one)!!  We want our Red Cell Team!
