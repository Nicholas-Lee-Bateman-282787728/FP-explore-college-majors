6590376,1,B00MNOLC30,"Five stars? Those people must be connected to anyone involved in this film. Poor acting, bad script and bad camerawork. Even for a horror movie, the character's reactions to situations are stupid. I rented this for only $3.99 and still felt ripped off.

I the story about a murdered sorority girl, the group kills and buries a girl. Yet when she comes back from the dead, the killers act as if it was just a game of hide and seek gone wrong. They don't wonder why the cops weren't called on them, or how she looks even better than when they threw her in a grave, and they don't freak out at all.

Avoid this film. It's just a waste of time.",1416096000,6,640,4.237704918032787

The bad guys are so awful in thisrapists, child molesters and nasty, nasty sorority girlsthat against my best moral precepts I smiled a little to see them get their very painful just deserts.

6590378,1,B00MNOLC30,"Perhaps unintentionally, the title catches the soulless nature of this movie: ""Dead Girls"" is as flat and affectless as is possible without slipping into the  phrases of  medicine or the police where steel ing oneself from evil is necessary and so a given.

The dead girls in question are murdered in a fit psychotic rage, by accident, and in cold blood.

Men don't fare much better since their guilty suffer some sort of genital mutilation--which might be judged deserved if that sort of revenge is to one's taste.

This movie is easy to sit through because it is made of three separate episodes of decent girls being killed and rotten guys getting castrated,  Before, you can be consciously disgusted, the next movie has begun.  So you can sit through all but only feel their true and full impact when the last is over.

The Simpsons' Chief Clancy signature phrase fits this waste of your time and money, ""There is nothing to see here.""

6590392,3,B00MNOLC30,Gravitas Ventures is actually a pretty good organization. I've seen 4 of their films in the last 2 days. I believe it's the storylines and actors that bring the films down. The picture quality and editing are spot on.,1432166400,,217,4.589743589743589

6590394,3,B00MNOLC30,"""Over My Dead Body"" is a slice of domestic violence. The story doesn't start off as seeming too creative. It has moments of weakness, but there are some real cool moments in this short story also. ""Theta Phi's Never Die"" is an insanely clichd horror concept that starts off clunky, and fumbles a lot of the moments meant to draw out the black satirical writing. The story does pick up and have some cool, entertaining action and kills equal to slasher horror stuff. ""Vengeance Is Mine"" is a really odd, out-of-step, tale that- at first- seems to not make sense. Overall though the director does a decent job because once the sinister nature becomes clear, the beginning falls in line with what is happening.

The wraparound story focuses on a young run away fleeing a potential victimizer. Seeking refuge in an old farm house she encounters an unusually gifted young woman. It is a very interesting story that takes place in segments throughout the film, much like classic 80's horror anthologies often did. Overall ""Dead Girls"" flutters a bit when it comes to originality and depth-there is not a lot of subtext or strong wit built into the tales. The acting is mediocre, a lot of the concepts have been done better in other films and originality falters in this anthology.  I am almost split, leaning more toward liking more moments than I hated.",1431475200,,1348,4.756410256410256

6590405,4,B00MNOLC30,"This is a compilation of few shorter films with one thing in common... Dead Girls. The movie itself relies on a wrap-around story that holds the shorter films together and in my opinion, it is done smartly and nicely. In the age of Ray Rice, Greg Hardy... etc, this movie hit's the nail on the head.

I will not go into the details of the movie but for me it was very watchable, though I thought it might too disjointed when the film began but the wrap kept it all together. For those who might think there is T&A in this movie, you might get a side view for a split second but nothing to make this movie into ""R"" rating territory. People must remember that all films can't have a big budget, so the film makers do with what they have. In this case I think it works.

It wasn't really scary, so I can't call this a horror movie. It is more along the lines of revenge/justice movie, with some supernatural aspects. If you like stories told by good story tellers, then this might be a movie you might like to watch. No one famous, the directors made the actors look good and the editing must have been difficult but I think they made film worth watching.

6590417,3,B00MNOLC30,"Anthology horror films seem to be on the rise lately, thanks to the success of titles like V/H/S and THE ABCS OF DEATH.  I don't mind this trend at all because I love anthologies, regardless of whether they are in book or movie form.  DEAD GIRLS is a recent release from the fine folks at Brain Damage Films.  This collection of three shorts is subject-specific, however, as each segment deals with dead girls back from the grave for revenge.  And while the tales included in this anthology have their faults, they are still entertaining and fun.

I grew up watching shows like TALES FROM THE CRYPT, THE TWILIGHT ZONE, MONSTERS, and TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE.  This is probably a big part of why I like anthologies so much.  Each episode or short usually packs a lot of punch in just a short amount of time.

DEAD GIRLS is shot fairly well, and the production value looks decent.  Each segment is made well for the most part, and each looks good onscreen.  I don't have many complaints about the film overall from an appearance standpoint.

Likewise, the acting is pretty decent as well.  This is a lower budget film, so one cannot expect Oscar-quality acting.  However, the whole cast does a good job in their roles here.  This is really saying something, too, for there are many main characters throughout the film.

The special effects in DEAD GIRLS are pretty good, although I would have preferred more gore.  Theres a small bit of carnage in each segment, but nothing that really stands out.  This is not necessarily a negative, and most people could probably care less about itbut this is my personal opinion.  I like to see limbs flying and fountains of crimson painting the walls.  But thats just me.

My main complaint with DEAD GIRLS is the lack of originality in the stories.  Even though the segments are well done, they just don't pop for me, mainly in part because theres nothing that sets them aside from other back-from-the-dead-for-revenge films.  Again, this is strictly from my point-of-view, so youll have to check the film out for yourself to see if you agree.

Still, DEAD GIRLS is fun.  I particularly like the sorority sisters segment.  Back in college, I knew several girls in sororities, and believe me: they acted A LOT like some of these girls.  Thus, when the revenge starts to happen in this short, I broke out in a smile.  I am on the fence about recommending the film as a whole, howeverI think its one you just have to check out to see if you like or not.  Its available now on DVD and On Demand.",1417996800,5,2527,4.580357142857143

8673246,3,B00MNOLC30,"Dead Girls begins by showing a woman running through the woods trying to escape from a man who's hot on her trail.  She finds a house to hide in and finds food in a towel.  She eats it.  She hears a weird child's laugh or cry coming from upstairs.

Story one is called Over My Dead Body.

We see people partying around a house.  One man is angry that he's often accused of being a drug dealer.  A man and his girlfriend get into an argument.  The boyfriend says to someone ""She's just a friend"" even though she kisses him on the mouth.  She says she came here to be with his boyfriend.

The girlfriend is now drunk and walks into a tattoo parlor.  She wants a tattoo that says ""Don't f with me for all eternity"".  The tattoo guy says something smart after recommending the woman sleep on her stomach- ""Pain let's us know we're still alive"".  The boyfriend and girlfriend who got into an argument earlier try to make out, but she pushes him away resulting in the boyfriend pushing her aggressively into the wall and killing her.  The boyfriend's friend walks in and they discuss how to remove the body with a house full of people around.

The next day they clean up around the front yard.  The two friends go for a ride and discuss dumping her body at an old dump site.  They dump a refrigerator with rope around it so we assume the dead girl's inside.  Later that morning the fridge begins to rattle as a man on a bike unties the fridge and sees the girl inside with pentagram marks on her back.  She jerks her body movements like something freaky from a Silent Hill game and walks down the street.

The boyfriend with another woman says he did the right thing.  Suddenly the dead girlfriend walks into the house with a knife.  She looks inside the bedroom where her boyfriend is making out with a woman.  Later that night she climbs on top of her boyfriend's friend in bed- the same guy who helped place her body in the refrigerator and recommended dumping her body at the dump site.  She stabs his chest.  As the boyfriend walks around the house in the dark, the dead girlfriend walks into the bedroom and stabs her boyfriend's girlfriend in the throat.  He heads back to the bedroom and sees his girlfriend stabbed to death.  He tries to leave but he stumbles into his dead girlfriend.  He says ""You don't want to do this!"" but she says ""Yeah, I kinda do!"" and stabs him in the chest.

We now see the girl in the beginning of the movie who was walking around upstairs to the sound of a child's laughter or crying.  She enters a bedroom and sees weird cult-like drawings in a book.

The next story is called Theta Phi's Never Die.

Three young men sneak up to a window where they see a woman taking her top off in a bedroom.  One guy says ""I think I broke my weiner"" and his male friend says ""That's the price you pay for a good side boob"".  We now see a girl bringing a prissy girl a drink, but it's the wrong one so she throws the drink all over the girl's dress.  The prissy girl then finishes by saying ""You can wear that dress tonight as a symbol of your stupidity"".

The prissy girl turns and says to her friend ""Not all of us can solve our problems by calling daddy to write a check"" and she replies ""A problem poor people must have"" which puts the prissy girl in her place.  We now see two girls talk about sorority stuff outside.  The one girl is too shy to have a drink because she's younger than 21.  The prissy girls take pictures off the wall of the college girls they want to humiliate.  At a party the shy girl is too afraid to do anything.  She bumps into a girl who asks her where she got that dress.  Before the shy girl has time to answer the girl says ""Burn it"".  These sorority girls are so ignorant!  At the party a man and a girl talk about touching each other's chests.  Suddenly his girlfriend shows up and yells at him.  The shy girl comes up to the girl and asks what's wrong.  She says ""I was so close to touching his nipple!""

The sorority girls start their initiation.  They welcome the shy girl.  She has to go through the ritual of gradual passage.  She has to drink from a cup to finalize her journey to sisterhood.  As she does the sorority girls turn demonic with masks on and grab her.  Suddenly the shy girl foams from the mouth and dies.  The sorority girls declare they aren't going to discuss this with anyone, and if they do the one sorority girl will make their lives a nightmare.  She plans to bury the girl so they can go home.

The sorority girls go through with the ritual and the shy girl comes out of the ground.  She rings the front doorbell of the sorority girls.  They're stunned to see her!  They mention she looks different and she says ""A new hairstyle can make you feel so alive!""  The shy girl says she was looking for the girls because she wants to know when they can start moving her things into the house.  The sorority girls are scared and say she can move in whenever she wants.

The sorority girls go to the spot the shy girl was buried.  They discuss the shy girl and remember she never brought up the night of the initiation.  The head sorority girl asks ""Did any of you even check for a pulse?""  They all say no.  In the next scene one girl wakes up in bed and says ""It still bugs me"".  Just then her boyfriend pops up and says ""It's the same thing- just one more mouth!"" and she says ""Shut up, not that!""  She says she's worried about the shy girl.  Suddenly a third sorority girl walks into the room and says she's lonely and frisky.  The guy says ""Greatest night ever!""  Meanwhile the girl who recommended the shy girl burn her dress gets a shower.  The shy girl walks into the room.  She apologizes for treating the shy girl like crap.  The shy girl then throws something in the girl's bath water and electrocutes her to death.

The sorority girls with that guy in bed tell him to go outside.  He hilariously thinks the killer might be a dude attacking frat boys, but the head sorority girl says ""If that's the case he'd attack frats!""  The guy walks through the house and sees the shy girl in the kitchen.  He says she looks hot.  She tells him about a rumor going around school that the only ones who can enjoy his thingy are these three sorority girls.  She says ""I know one girl who is just dying to enjoy your services!""  and they begin to make out.  But unfortunately for the guy, the shy girl then pushes his head into the refrigerator and rips his thingy off.

He walks into the sorority girl's room holding his bloody area and falls over dead.  The girls recommend calling the cops.  A sorority girl shows up and says everyone outside is dead.  One sorority girl tries to hide in a bedroom but she hears something from a closet.  It's her friend.  She hanged herself.  The sorority girl who just showed up is now in a dark room.  The shy girl attacks her and she dies, then hangs her body as well.  Meanwhile the other sorority girls try to run out of the house.

When one of the sorority girls sees the hanging body she tries to run away but can't exit the door down the hall so the shy girl stabs her to death.  The shy girl then tries to strangle the head of the sorority girls, but she gets a surprise when another deceased sorority girl appear.  The head girl begs for her life and says ""I'll give you boys, popularity, or anything you want!"" but the shy girl says ""I want you to die!""  As the sorority girl runs outside she says ""I'm not running anymore!  This is my house!"" and just then a car comes by and hits her.

The girl from earlier who was looking through the cult pictures on the bed gets a visitor.  A man holding a candle walks up the stairs and sees the book some woman is holding while in bed.  He turns around and the girl who walked up here in the beginning of the movie stabs him to death after he sees a demon in the other woman's face.

Vengeance Is Mine is the final story.  A man gives his cute girlfriend a necklace as she walks across the street after finishing school.  We see four prostitutes get into an argument.  The one angry prostitute says to the other younger one ""I know how much you make and how the guys love your little girl pout"".  She defends herself by saying she has enough money to get away from here.  A girl walks up to a preacher and says ""You know I need to have my money tonight"".  He says for old time's sake he wants her to put a mask on.  He says ""I'm the one who kept you in school"" and ""Do you think your father would be proud to see what you are?"" implying she's a prostitute.

The cute girl prays at a church.  She lost her mother to an illness and her father as well.  The preacher says ""You have a special place in God's heart"".  Meanwhile the guy who took in the prostitute and kept her in school goes crazy and punches her on a bed.  We now see the cute girl approach a nun and say she really needs to talk to somebody.  She mentions the father started putting his hand on her leg and touched her.  The nun slaps her saying ""How dare you say such filthy lies about a good man"" and orders she go to her room since she the nun can't bear to look at her right now.

The prostitute nun questions God.  ""How can you make him do that to me?"" and ""You just let it happen father"".  Suddenly the nun appears and says ""You can take that talk out to the streets where it belongs"" and ""Don't you think I know what kind of sick things you do with men for money"".  The nun says she's not surprised.  The girl always told filthy lies and she's always been a filthy wh from the beginning.  The girl snaps and strangles her.

The girl heads into a library and meets a man who says ""It's all bullcrap"" (the rituals in the books).  The angry prostitute from earlier says the girl is an ungrateful little ho because she makes 5 grand while she can't even make a nickel.  Her male friend says it's because men like them young.  The mean prostitute says she isn't leaving until she gets paid.  She recommends to her male friend to take the girl to an alley behind a bar, beat the crap out of her, take the keys and steal the cash.

Just then the girl appears.  The mean prostitute pretends to be agitated by her male friend's behavior and storms away.  He invites the prostitute girl into his car.  They head to the alley.  Since she's dressed in a nun's uniform he mentions how much he loves nuns.  She suddenly stabs and kills the guy!  Just then the mean prostitute appears and says to the girl ""What's wrong?  Did he try and hurt you?""  The nun prostitute says ""You think I owe you something don't you?""  The mean prostitute reminds her that the guy she just killed wanted someone younger.  The nun prostitute circles the mean prostitute with a knife.  The mean prostitute says ""I tried to help you!"" but the nun prostitute says ""Yeah you tried to help me alright- by turning me into a wh like you!"" and then stabs her to death.

The nun prostitute approaches the preacher man who punched her on that bed.  She pulls out a knife and says ""You know all about sin father!""  She says ""You think raping girls is harmless didn't you?"" and then stabs him in the hand and chest.  She cuts his weiner off and places it in his mouth as he lays there crying.  She takes her nun uniform off and throws it on his chest.  We see a woman say ""My eyes are your eyes"" and ""My hate is your hate"".  ""You are now my hands, my lips, my ears.  You will fight my battles and win my wars.  You shall make men pay.  This is our time, our world, take it, it is yours!""

The girl in the bedroom walks outside and meets up with two other (dead) girls.  One girl says ""You need more leaves. I can tell someone is under here"".  The other girl says ""You'll like it here"".  Another dead girl says ""It has been millennia since father has spoken to me.  He crossed the sea just to speak to me.  I had taken the form of a man.  They said I was possessed by demons.  Man is the most cruel beast of all when he takes that form.  But what's worse is father did not know his own child.  He says ""What is your name?""  I say ""I am Legion!""  Just then all the dead girls appear together and walk around in a field as a pretty awesome jazzy/heavy guitar song plays during the credits.  This song's pretty fascinating actually.  ""I'm comfortable enough to accept mortality!""

I was just about to give Dead Girls 2 stars but the final story is a lot better than the previous two.  A nun being a prostitute and having to persevere inner torment due to a preacher raping her along with the daily dangers of being a prostitute and the criticisms she has to face at church is a pretty solid idea for a story.  Okay I suppose story 2 is okay, but it feels really cliched.  Sorority girls... meh.  Story one is super weak though.  I probably wouldn't recommend this.",1502755200,,12741,4.217842323651452
8673247,2,B00MNOLC30,"Two and a half stars to this reasonably interesting triple feature of three shorts, all of them related to young women.

The wraparound story features a girl fleeing from some sort of abuser. Taking shelter in a creepy house leads to the presentation of three tales of sexually and otherwise abused girls, who end up getting revenge, often from beyond the grave.

The acting is okay for a low-budget feature, and in fact even the rough edges add to a certain atmosphere that works pretty well throughout the film.

The direction at least keeps things moving and kept my interest enough for me to watch it all the way through, even though I'd only intended to glance at it and go to something else. The direction is uneven, but this actually helps the film by adding to the impression of a chaotic atmosphere, so it all works out okay toward its own low-budget purpose.

There is not much gore here, though there are some fairly bloody scenes, and at one key point a good parade of zombie-like girls.

The movie is infused throughout with references to witchcraft, the message apparently being that some girls feel oppressed enough to turn to the ""dark arts"" for help. There is also the usual anti-Christian and anti-clerical message, which is tiresome to me but is a staple of many horror movies, never mind if it makes any sense. At one point here a girl is asking a cross why God did nothing to help her. Somehow she misses that it was on the cross that God's Son subjected Himself to death just as humans experience it, so that no one can say He doesn't know our pain. And many horror fans have forgotten about the heroic priests of The Exorcist and jumped on the bandwagon against the Church.

Overlooking this, though, I found the movie half-decent and would recommend a look at it.",1486684800,,1787,4.586206896551724
