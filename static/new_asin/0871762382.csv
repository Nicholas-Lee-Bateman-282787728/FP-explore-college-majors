The film begins with scenes that suggest the 19th century. ""No one escapes his destiny."" Knock, the house agent, reads a strange letter from Count Orlok of Transylvania and sends his agent Thomas Kutter to finish the deal. [Do the actors seem weird?] The name of Count Orlok surprises and scares the people at the inn. A strange animal is outside (a striped hyena). Kutter goes to Orlok's castle; the sun is setting. Kutter awakes the next morning to find his meal. He has two bites on his neck, the mosquitoes are terrible there. Kutter learns the secret but is trapped until he can escape. Knock the house agent has gone mad: flies and spiders!

Ellen awaits the return of Thomas. A ship sails the Baltic Sea. One sailor falls sick, then others. The captain is last to go. What is the matter with Ellen? Count Orlok arrives in Wisburg to inhabit that house. That ship lands with no living soul aboard. Is it the plague? This results in many deaths. A mob chases Knock, blaming him for the plague. What will Ellen do to rid Wisburg of the plague? Will Orlok make the mistake of tardying before departing? Will Ellen be saved? The plague ends as suddenly as it started.

The creators of this film were sued for violating the copyright of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". They changed the names but this story tracks ""Dracula"". This appears to be a low budget film. Setting this story in the 19th century seems more credible than the 20th century. The fall in 1921 for agricultural prices was worldwide. Does a recession create a market for horror pictures? The 1932 Hollywood film ""Dracula"" remains the classic version of this story. [Were the ears of ""Mister Spock"" copied from Orlok?] Horror stories like these died out after victory in WW II and the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. Horror films then were based on ""science"" (like giant ants or invaders from space). Will more horror films be produced in the current recession? One consolation is that horror films will never become a TV series.

In this and other films the bite of a vampire is shown as two small punctures about 3 cm apart. That represents a small mouth like a snake or small animal. How much blood could be extracted that way? Would there be enough calories? If not, that is proof for the non-existence of vampires.",1446163200,,2304,4.639705882352941
