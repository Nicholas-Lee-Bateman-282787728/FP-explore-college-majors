7999125,5,B0000CDLCH,"It's amazing that, this day and age a performance artist can create spectacular visual art without 1) insulting the audience intelligence, 2) using profane language and vulgar visuals, and 3) provoke thought!

Laurie Anderson has created wonderful performance art pieces over many years.  Unfortunately ""Home of the Brave"" is the only full length live testament of her creativity.  I've enjoyed this on laser disc for many years and am thrilled it finally came out on DVD!!!  I highly recommend it!",1096416000,2,498,5.1875
