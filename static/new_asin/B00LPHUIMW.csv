6498455,4,B00LPHUIMW,"I have seen Lang Lang live playing this same programme as he did in this Royal Albert Hall recital.
For general consumer information, the first half of this recital's live recording (Mozart Sonatas) is also released in both LP and CD in Lang Lang's 'Mozart Album'. This DVD, therefore, gives a visual 'reading' of how LL approaches Mozart. Generally, Lang Lang is not a bad interpretor of Mozart (his early recordings and performances of Mozart testified), yet in this recital, what shows up is that there is one aspect at least of Mozart that Lang Lang has yet to embrace before he can rank among the true Mozart interpretors. This shows up in the a minor K310 sonata.
The a minor sonata is a great work that few famous pianists can fully come to grips with. The work was in fact a highly sombre and pathetic piece, in the same vein as the Requiem Mass. The hidden pathos are all in the modulations and harmonics, and wonderful as Lang Lang, he has still some good lengths to go before he can fully capture the contents of this work. One only wish he sill reprise this in 20 years' time.
The second half of the recital sees Lang Lang in his true colour.
This first recording (live) of his interpretation of the four Chopin Ballads proves that Lang Lang has come a very long way with this favourite composer of his. The passage works are dazzling and refined, the expressivity to the point of being emotionally shattering. Lang Lang plays all four pieces with a 'one-breath' sort of concentration, even if in-between applauses erupted like volcanic outbursts (yes, standing ovations. And not all the audiences are newbies, mind you. The ones that applauded the hardest are the good oldies).
The 8 encore pieces comprise two Latin compositions, a Chinese composition, a romantic Brahms Davidsb&uuml;ndlert&auml;nze excerpt, a Chopin Nocturne, a dazzling Alla Turca from the A major sonata, and ends with a Scriabin Etude. But it was the Chopin Minute Waltz that brought all the audience at the Royal Albert Hall off their feet.
At long last, Lang Lang succeeded in establishing himself as one of the foremost interpretors of the works of Chopin.",1420070400,6,2144,4.766129032258065

6498460,5,B00LPHUIMW,"If I could give this DVD more than 5 stars I would. The Mozart Sonatas 4 & 5 have an exquisite feather weight touch combined with a vivid imagination, whereas the Sonata #8 in A minor K310 is a bit heavy and sounds like early Beethoven. Its the Four Chopin Ballades that are truly stunning. Ive been listening to these works for over 50 years and never have I heard more feeling, poetry, subtle nuances and countless expressive insights combined with a jaw dropping technique that is always at the service of the composer. The 8 encores are also magnificent and in my opinion this DVD is musical history in the making. An absolute treasure by a living legend.

 The recital is divided into two parts: The first half consists of 3 Mozart Sonatas No. 5 (G major K283), No. 4 (E flat major K282), and No. 8 (A minor K310) with the second half being devoted to Chopin's Four Ballades.

The Mozart sometimes comes across like the work of a mid Romantic composer, with a huge range of expression, from thundering grandeur to softly sighing pianissimo. The requisite light touch is always present when called for, but Lang Lang showed himself as quite willing to indulge in rubato and free dynamic interpretation. A few of the more aggressive sforzando accents may be a bit overdone, but the wit and often simple elegance which color his playing show just what a delight Mozart can be.

The bravura passages in the Mozart Sonatas showed exhilarating flair and brilliance while the melodic lines of the andantes and adagios were graceful yet firmly profiled, with secondary voices allotted their due place. Above all, there was a measured yet flexible approach to tempo that gave individual ideas space to breathe, and placed them within their wider contexts with seemingly effortless deliberation.

The 4 Chopin Ballades showed an almost pathological avoidance of any kind of exhibitionism in regards to Lang Langs transcendental virtuosity during the lyrical sections, but when technique is called for he plays the most difficult passages with an ease that borders on the supernatural. The combination of vision, poetry and power in this music is tremendous, and I have never heard them played better. The Ballade No. 1 (not to be confused with his performance at Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, shown on Youtube, where there is excessive use of the sustaining pedal during the opening)has the most amazing abundance of expressive insights ranging from Pianissimo to Piannississimo  during the first few pages, making the glorious central sections thunder and sweep sound even more breathtaking. As for Ballades 2, 3 & 4 these are the greatest renditions I've ever heard.

There are 8 encores: 1) Dance of the Seaweed by Wu Zuqiang  & Du Mingxin;  2) Chopin Waltz in D flat (minute waltz) which Lang Lang plays as fast as Rachmaninoff and with just as many subtle nuances; 3) Chopin Nocturne in E flat major opus 55 No. 2;  4) Lecuona's y la negra bailaba;  5) Mozart's Rondo alla Turk; where Lang Lang emphasizes Mozart's wit and humour and has the audience laughing quite a bit 6) Ponce Intermezzo No. 1 in E minor an exquisite work sounding like early Rachmaninoff; 7) Schumann Davidsbundlertanze opus 6 no. 14; 8) Scriabin Etude in D# minor opus 8 no. 12 (this final encore of Scriabin's Etude in D# minor is absolutely electrifying and in my opinion has never been played better)

The DVD menu gives you the option between 5.1 surround or 2.0 PCM stereo. 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound provides 2 surround channels which cover the entire audible range from 20Hz to 20,000Hz.",1414195200,15,3573,4.858552631578948

I was expecting to be distracted by a pop star type performance but was not at all.  We enjoyed Lang Lang's involvement and striking sensitivity with the music very much.

6498470,1,B00LPHUIMW,"The audio quality is great. The camera positioning was ideal. But the guy running or the person directing the guy running the video switcher REALLY BLEW IT. Seen plenty of pictures of the ""concert hall"", really great for the realtor when it comes time to sell the hall .... Seen a lot of the posts, railings, sound reflectors, audience and all kinds of OTHER CRAP. I bought the DVD for 1 reason, to see Lang Lang play the piano, finger the keys, his playing with expression. Instead I saw a cheap MTV STYLE"" pile of crap, showing only tiny clips of Lang Lang fingering the piano keys., Lots and lots of bouncing around from camera to the next camera, extremely irritating to watch !!!!.

Lang Lang should have been shown on split screen, one window of his face and the other window of his fingers on the piano keys, the view from the over head camera zoomed in on  the piano keyboard. That was a really great camera position.  If each camera had it's own VTR then re-edit it and SHOW A LOT OF LANG LANG PLAYING THE PIANO ...If the only recorded video was from the output of the switcher then ALL IS LOST !!!!!  Oh well, can't fix it !!!!!",1426809600,13,1138,4.35377358490566
