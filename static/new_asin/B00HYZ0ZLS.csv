6243642,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"I revisited this series after watching the new 2013 series which stars Mark Williams (of Harry Potter fame) and which I really enjoyed. I had seen this Kenneth More series many years ago and had hoped the film quality would be better in this set - it isn't. However, I appreciated More's measured performance much more this time around and the rational objective way in which he solves each mystery. He reminds me of Jesuit priests I have known and I think he is very true to life as it was in the time period in which Chesterton wrote. (The Mark Williams series is set in a later period). Dennis Burgess is a real presence as the reformed jewel thief, Flambeau, and most of the episodes I liked here had him in them. Some of the acting (not More's or Burgess) is over the top and a bit grating - my theory is that some of these actors were stage people who were used to projecting a larger presence and didn't adapt well to television. Overall, this is an older mystery series set in a period almost a hundred years ago so worth a watch. Stream it first if you aren't sure.",1400976000,19,1074,4.321782178217822
6243643,1,B00HYZ0ZLS,"I was a huge fan of Kenneth More, but was greatly disappointed in these DVDs.  The scripts could have been written my a first-time author, and the acting was dismal.  I'm donating these to my local library, and will continue to watch Mr. More in ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Sink the Bismarck"".",1399680000,4,285,4.461538461538462
6243644,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Watching FATHER BROWN is like watching a time capsule. Although aired in the 1970s, (not THAT long ago) there is an old-fashioned quality about this series that will either charm the viewer or leave you shaking your head at the at times overt theatricality of some of the performances.

To fairly judge this series, one must adopt the perspective that the G.K. Chesterton short stories from which these 13 episodes are adapted are from a time when melodrama, a sort of heightened dramatic style, was prevalent on stage and screen. This understanding of the style or tone of the source material is integral to appreciating the artistry that went into making this series. Therefore it would be a mistake to dismiss FATHER BROWN as dated or overdone.

Additionally, with a masterful Kenneth More as the delightfully absentminded Father Brown, the programs are not without subtlety, which contrasts brilliantly with the colourful theatricality of some of the other performances. Even the staging of many scenes looks as if the show was designed for a live audience, with actors sometimes almost declaiming their lines and projecting their characterizations ""to the back row"". (Again, this is all part of the style of the show and one either accepts it or is put off by it). More's performance provides the balance between melodrama and mannered realism. The effect is rather like J.B. Priestly's (a contemporary of Chesterton's) description of how an audience will watch the villain tie the heroine to the railroad track in horror, but will not do anything to try to stop it: it's real enough to provoke a reaction but heightened enough that the audience knows they are not perceiving actuality.

All in all, I loved it and was not put off by the occasional hammy performance which is ""more"" than compensated by More's considered portrayal. Seeing a slightly befuddled More muttering and bumbling as he puts two and two together is an absolute delight. One must remember that Kenneth More was regarded as one of the finest light comedians to ever grace the silver screen. He was also much more, capable of being heroic (as in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, for example). More is an absolute master of film acting and even when he says very little (until his inevitable explanation of the crime near the end of each episode) he is the centre of our focus. Without his anchoring influence, FATHER BROWN would become tiresome, but such is his star power, even after his career had been in decline for a decade, that Kenneth More literally saves the day.

When he is matched by guest stars the like of Peter Copley (episode The Curse of the Golden Cross) or Ronald Pickup (episode The Eye of Apollo) More is especially fine and the shows have a sparkle about them that justifies their re-release in a collector's edition box set by Acorn Media. In the episode The Three Tools of Death, More is reunited with the blustery Scottish actor James Hayter, who acted opposite More in the excellent re-make of THE 39 STEPS in 1959--Hayter played Mr. Memory.

A word about the actor Peter Copley, the clergyman in the episode The Curse of the Golden Cross. Copley had a mellifluous voice and keen intelligence, so much so that he was able to successfully employ these attributes as a part-time lawyer during the 1960s. This reviewer had a wonderful experience working with him at the Bristol Old Vic in 1981. Copley was one of the stars of a brilliant stage production of Brecht's THE RESISTIBLE RISE OF ARTURO UI. As a young drama student at the Old Vic, I was one of four lucky aspirants who was selected to appear as various extras in the production. On the first day of rehearsal, Peter Copley ushered the four of us to the nearest pub at the end of the day and bought us all a drink--just to say ""welcome"" and to make us feel part of the team. His generosity as a person was palpable in his performances as an actor, always giving, sharing and never attempting to steal focus. He was an exceptional performer who, while never a major star, was highly respected and whose work always raised the standard of any production of which he was a part.

It is precisely the kind of acting that Peter Copley (and Ronald Pickup, James Hayter, etc) bring to this series that helps elevate FATHER BROWN to classic status. Bernard Lee, ""M"" in the Sean Connery and first four Roger Moore Bond films, also appears in an episode (The Quick One). This is worthy of note since More was being considered as Lee's ""M"" replacement at around this time. (Lee of course is the grandfather of Jonny Lee Miller, currently starring in the Sherlock Holmes series ELEMENTARY).

Part of the fun of watching older programs such as FATHER BROWN is identifying the supporting actors, as mentioned above. When a series has so many guest-stars who went on to make their mark in so many other films and television programs it is proof in the pudding, so to speak, that their other, lesser-known work (like FATHER BROWN) is worth watching and preserving. Bravo to the powers that be who determined that while FATHER BROWN might seem dated to some, it is a wonderful series that deserves rediscovery.

Perhaps a future edition will include subtitles, a must for many people to fully enjoy the witty dialogue and plethora of British accents on display. However this series still rates five stars in my opinion. Kenneth More still had a lot of tricks up his cassock sleeve when he undertook this beloved role. Long may he be remembered.

6243645,1,B00HYZ0ZLS,"The stories take so long to develop and are so predictable that it's far from legendary . I don't know what detective series it now influences , except the ones shown on the Hallmark channel .",1398297600,,192,4.361111111111111
6243646,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Kenneth more plays father Brown in this series based on G. K. Chesterton's books.  I cannot tell you how close this comes to the books themselves as I have not read them yet.

Each episode is a complete story in itself where we meet the characters, build up the mystery, try to second-guess father Brown, and wrap up in the end.  Actually the ending of his stories are not that neatly wrapped as he usually leaves it to the culprit to do the right thing.

Dennis Burgess plays Hercule Flambeau (Father Brown's friend); he is advertised throughout the DVD but does not show up for several episodes.

I have to admit that several times on my first viewing I had the stop and think about where I have seen the actor(s) before.

The quality of each story varies widely so there will be some favorites and some duds depending on what you want to see.  The production itself looks quite inexpensive and locations and production sets.  The quality of the recording leaves something to be desired; I am not sure if it is the original recording or the media.  In any case you will be so wrapped up in the story that you will care about the production quality.",1396310400,8,1150,4.464114832535885
6243647,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"One of the great series of 1974. It was a bit under-watched coming in the height of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Released years ago as 2 sets. The picture is state of the art 70s. Adaptations of GK Chesterton and a worthy 1920 period style. Costumes, props, cars, sets are perfect for post-world war England. Combining classic storytelling and nostalgic theatre style makes this a delight for retro-TV enthusiasts. Also offers interesting peeks at guest star roles by some of Britain's finest, some looking quite young, some now deceased. Kenneth More, brilliant as Father John Brown, becomes amateur crime-solver in all 13 episodes.

Titled like Chesterton's short stories, no SDH or CC, but speech is clear. This is the complete 1974 collection, but 2013-14 has 20 new Chesterton adaptations so far. Can't wait for DVDs. Chesterton wrote 48 Fr Brown stories.

6243651,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Having watched through the complete series, I feel confident in saying that Kenneth More's Father Brown is an underappreciated jewel. I was really pleased by the theological and intellectual depth of several episodes (see for example ""The Hammer of God""). I believe this series does capture something of the original G.K. Chesterton detective stories that is lacking in the newer Mark Williams series (though I also enjoy this incarnation). The current DVD package itself is rather sparse, but the episodes still shine. For the American audience, a nice bonus feature I would recommend to add in a future reissue would be the Masterpiece Mystery! introductions by the late Vincent Price, when the series initially aired on PBS in 1982. A must-watch for puzzle-lovers, detective buffs, and curious Catholics.",1494115200,5,807,5.3125

6243659,4,B00HYZ0ZLS,"I was intrigued by another reviewer about how good the 1974 version of Father Brown was versus the current version. I've since watched both versions and they are definitely produced very differently. One is a lone wolf while the other has a cast of supporters.  I've never read Chesterton but find the 1974 version of Father Brown, which is supposedly more true to  the author, to be very wordy and the endings unsatisfying. They feel very chopped. They seem to violate that rule of writing - show don't tell. In most of these you are told the solution but rarely shown the result. Where is the climax? Where is murderer being arrested?  At least in the current version you are usually shown the end result. I appreciate them being updated somewhat without totally losing the intent of the stories. Afterall the stories are over 100 years old and need some adaptation for current audiences. Perhaps they are more PC but then much of the world has grown up since 1914 and accept that prejudices are unacceptable, be they anti-Semitic or anti-gay. Overall, I like both series with a nod to the current version.",1481846400,5,1108,4.730569948186528

The filming looks like it was done on video tape, the sound is amateurish and the acting worse (except for Moore). The episodes I saw felt very much like a stage play with a tiny cast, all the scenes in two interior rooms, and the other limitations of the stage. I wish I could recommend this, but I cannot. But I suppose I should also say that I found the newer series fairly wretched as well, but for different reasons. Perhaps Father Brown is just not for me.",1468368000,,566,4.201834862385321

6243674,4,B00HYZ0ZLS,"If there is one thing that bothers me about this series -that is so faithful to G.K. Chesterton's characters - it is the ""live television"" feel of the production - as if you are watching a play being videotaped, which is pretty much how the shows were produced. The series really shows its age when you compare it with the new BBC series starring Mark Williams as ""Father Brown."" The newer series looks as if it were shot on film, with a good budget and fine production values - but, if you love G.K. Chesterton's orginal stories featuring the little priest detective, THIS is the series you should own!

Kenneth More captures the essence of Chesterton's ""Father Brown,"" although today's actor Mark Williams looks more like the way the author described him. Nonetheless, once you get past that and the slight low-budget feel of the production, a G.K. Chesterton fan should be more than satisfied with this wonderful old series. However, I wish the producers had made a two-part episode of Chesterton's first story, ""The Iron Cross,"" which delves into the capture of the colorful jewel thief Flambeau, whom Fr. Brown has his heart set on converting to Catholicism to save his soul - and (as it turns out) become a colleague in crime detection. You get the idea that the series was really starting to get a full head of steam up with some of the episodes, and then, all of a sudden, you realize you've seen them all.

Absolutely worthwhile for fans of G.K. Chesterton's wonderful ""Father Brown""!",1458259200,4,1493,4.7384615384615385

Camp, but I dig it.",1430611200,4,331,4.32258064516129
6243715,4,B00HYZ0ZLS,"I have watched the two seasons of the original Father Brown with the late Kenneth More and two seasons of the latest series with Mark Williams and to me there is no comparison between the two.

Kenneth More captures the essence of Chesterton's character almost as well as David Suchet cpatures the essence of Hercule Poirot in the Agatha Christie series. The difference, however, is that Suchet physically fits Christie's description of Poirot while More does not physically fit Chesteron's description of Father Brown as short, fat and a bit slovenly. In all other respects, though, More IS Father Brown as described by Chesterton.  Mark Williams, star of the current series, is an outstanding actor but he captures neither the essence of Father Brown's character as created by Chesterton nor his physical appearance.

To a great extent this is not Williams' fault.  Screen writers have taken outrageous liberties with the Chesterton stories to the point that some of them are barely recognizable and that makes it almost impossible for Williams to get into the Chesterton chracter of Father Brown.

The older series gives Kennth More much more to work with though some reviewers are clearly offended by racism and anti-semitism that marks some of the Chesterton stories as they were written and which are common among writers of that time including Agatha Christie.  It's possible to write that stuff out but often when you do, it changes the entire story.

Unfortunately the writers of the current series apparently do not have the talent to adapt the Chesterton stories to today's politically correct sanitized artificial world. The More series, though dated in production quality, portrays Father Brown exactly as characterized by Chesterton. In that respect the current series is a total failure.

It would have been better and far more honest if the producers had provided a diferent title and character because, if you're not a fan of the real Father Brown, it's a pretty good series. If you are a fan of the real Father Brown and G.K. Chesterton, you'll much prefer the Kenneth More version.",1430352000,28,2100,5.0491329479768785

Initially, the series held promise, with wry Chesterton quotes regarding the lack of historic churches in the U.K. belonging to Catholics, due to Henry VIII. But there are problematic issues regarding poor adaptation overall. In ""The Curse of the Golden Cross"" there are inaccurate, disturbing, and shockingly antisemitic phrases regarding medieval burnings, and rich, smug Jews scoffing.

This series, while much better is nevertheless creaky in its joints and has not aged well. Still, it generally tries to do well by the Chesterton stories, and often does.  This is from a period in which there were many Briish TV adaptations of classic detectives - Brett as Holmes,  Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, Roy Marsden as Dalgleish, John Thaw as Morse, Ian Carmichael as Wimsey, and looking back, it feels like the genre had yet to find a solid approach to TV storytelling.  The Morse and Holmes adaptations have mostly stood the test of time, but like this Father Brown, the others are often too - something - - too slow or too fast or too long or too literal or too talky or in some other way, not well adapted to the limitations of TV as well as modern expectations.

I enjoy Chesterton and his Father Brown, but I can't reccomend him universally - he's simply not got a universal appeal.  But if you've tried Chesterton and liked him, this will do well.",1425772800,12,1109,4.433497536945813

6243776,5,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Chesterton wrote the first Father Brown story in 1911. It was the first thing he wrote that clicked with the British public. The amazing thing is that 100 years later, it's still clicking. This series aired on PBS Mystery! in the states forty years ago. Just now have the two series been collected by Acorn Media into one four disc DVD set. Unlike a great many shows from the '70s, this one is still eminently watchable. One reason is that it was set in the 'tens and 'twenties, and thus has a period look. Another reason is that Chesterton is his own animal. This series tantalizingly draws one in, and makes one want to read the stories. Penguin released its five individual Father Brown paperbacks in a box set in 1982, featuring Kenneth More from this series as Father Brown on the covers. These four one-sided discs are the same ones that appeared in the two disc individual sets for season one (purple) and season two (green).

My favorite episodes in this series are those with Flambeau, because I think he and Father Brown make good sidekicks.

Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote fifty-one short stories in the early twentieth century. Father Ignatius Brown is a parish priest and also an amateur detective whose observations and psychological insights are used to unravel mysteries. Chesterton was a master of paradox (truth standing on its head to attract attention) with his witty stories. He was inspired by a remark about priests, where auricular confessions can reveal many crimes to a parish priest who learns about the sins of people. Fr. Brown is a most unlikely detective compared to other detectives of fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe, Hercule Poirot, etc.). These thirteen stories are taken from the five volumes of short stories.
