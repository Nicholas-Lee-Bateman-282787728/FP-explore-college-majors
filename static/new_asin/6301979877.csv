7820504,4,6301979877,"This movie features Mark Harmon and Mimi Rogers, whom I think has never had her due as an actress. The movie was suspenseful and enjoyable with a touch of humor. I was surprised to see Mark Harmon do a nude scene. AFter making love to Mimi, Mark arises from their bed to check out noises coming from downstairs. As he walks towards the door, we see Mark's yummy bubble butt. Once he is downstairs in the darkened house, Mark searches with a baseball bat. There is a thunderstorm outside and the flashes of lightning cause dimly lit glimpses of the naked Mark. As he steps outside, you can almost see his junk but not quite. So it's a decent story with a nice look at Mark's ass.",1356652800,2,678,4.346456692913386

7820506,1,6301979877,"How did they ever convince Mark Harmon that nudity was necessary for the ""artistic integrity"" of this movie? He was 40 years old at the time - hardly a naive ingenue. Or maybe he just showed up naked for filming one day and they said ""Oh, we can work around that.""",1270339200,4,264,4.196078431372549
7820507,5,6301979877,"For fans of Mark Harmon (and I am one), this little gem is not to be missed!

The story here is this: a woman discovers that her missing husband  has a completely separate identity and an extensive police file. She hires an investigator to look into her husband's background. She and the investigator become more and more attracted to one another, yet the two must solve the mystery of the woman's husband before any relationship between them can continue.  The story may not be all that unique and different from many others of this genre, but it's the great chemistry between Mark Harmon and Mimi Rogers, and the way the story unravels that is so good here. Quite captivating!

Definitely recommended.  Too bad it's not on DVD -- but at least we can see this on video.  Grab it while you can.",1232928000,12,794,4.556338028169014
