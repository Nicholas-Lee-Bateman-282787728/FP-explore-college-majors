1172927,5,9089702296,Love that u have different areas around the beach. It's not just running on the ocean it's beside it as we'll. and enjoyed the sounds as well. I know I heard seals on the beach!!,1363824000,,178,4.114285714285714
1172928,1,9089702296,"Boring, Boring, boring.  The videography was adequate, but the scenery was too boring.  Camera could easily have scanned off to the side to view the ocean.",1330128000,,155,4.923076923076923
1172929,4,9089702296,"Here's my good and bad about this one.

It's well made. The photography, at least on my television, is as if I could reach out and touch the scenery.

Another good thing about it is, it's very much like what most people would be doing if they lived near the ocean, walking or running or cycling down roads near, not at, the ocean or beach.

That's the part that was less than perfect for me. There were times when I saw that ocean waaaaaaay in a distance. I even saw a few waves. I kept thinking we were going to get there soon and run barefoot as the waves break onto the sand. Didn't happen.

The bad was, it was boring. The desert can be interesting, but this one wasn't. The ocean can be heavenly, but we never really quite got there.

There was no music, which is fine for me. I like the natural sound or lack thereof, other than an occasional bird or sound of the ocean.

This would be ideal if a person wanted to have absolutely no distractions, nothing interesting, just a quiet walk, cycle, or run.

The part where we are running as the woman in the cover is,  right by the ocean, may be there somewhere. I just haven't found it yet. That was what I was hoping this DVD would be about.

So whether you like this one or not depends on what you are looking for. That's why I only took off one star. It isn't bad at all. In fact, it's good! It just wasn't what I thought it was when I bought it.",1308528000,10,1401,4.102564102564102

7901454,5,9089702296,"Another excellent installment in The Ambient Collection.
Very quiet and solitary locations.
The first of which is very fascinating for me. A completely other-worldly place of monolithic rock formations of various shapes and sizes with smaller rocks bordering both sides of the trails.
It looks a lot like Martian civilization or the Forbidden Zone of the Planet Of the Apes. Beautiful! I love it.
Yes I may be strange but I know what I like and I like ALL of my Ambient DVDs.
Less expensive than travel, perfect for the Staycation.",1485216000,,531,4.846153846153846

7901458,1,9089702296,Boring view of scrubby scenery with practically zero ocean views. Totally misleading product. The cover image is nowhere near what you get on the video.,1454457600,,152,5.12
7901459,5,9089702296,"This DVD is very good for a workout after a stressful day. Here you can run, walk or drive on the exercise bike and you meet nobody. You run or ride mostly on deserted sandy paths and hear the sound of the sea in the background. You cannot always see the ocean in the background, but the landscape is also beautiful to look at. I especially liked video 1, you can see amazing limestone pillars in the desert that have fascinated me. But the ways along the coast are very beautiful, you can hear  the lashing waves in the background. The various videos are very interesting and relaxing, with them exercising is great fun. I have tried the DVD with the treadmill and the exercise bike, they go perfectly with this DVD.",1433548800,,717,4.431818181818182

7901461,5,9089702296,"I truly enjoy being able to get the feel that I am jogging or walking outdoors rather than being stuck on a treadmill inside in bad weather and these CD's really give me that. I just turn on my music and before you know it I have put miles on the treadmill without the boredom of staring at nothing or out a window. After our move from California I missed some of the areas I hiked and there is a scene on this CD that reminds me of Reef point in California. I have several of these CD's to give me a variety from jogging on an island to the beaches in Spain, maybe one day they'll have one with the bulls of Spain chasing you! (just a thought Tony Ha Ha). If you have a small TV mounted in front of your treadmill then I recommend these CD's to help with your walking or jogging routine rather than watching a TV program. These are great motivators.",1398729600,,850,4.095808383233533
