620635,5,6303312381,"I am thrilled to see that this production is finally out on a decently priced DVD.  I haven't seen this production, which I think was on PBS many years ago, since it was on TV back then.  However, I was fortunate enough to see Miss Harris perform the play in Boston about five years ago.  In all my 55 years, of all the plays, concerts, films, etc. that I have ever seen, this was absolutely the finest piece of art I have ever witnessed.  Julie Harris is easily the greatest actress of the 20th Century, and this is her greatest role.  Absolutely spell-binding, moving beyond words.

Moreover, I agree with the reviewer who says that ""The Belle of Amherst"" is an outstanding way to present Emily Dickenson to students.  This goes for the general public as well.  A remarkable play.

Well, what more can I say?  I can't wait to see the DVD.  Hope it is of good quality.",1093996800,20,869,4.40251572327044
620636,5,6303312381,"I saw this years ago, and just recently rediscovered it.  I remember watching Julie Harris and wondering who is this woman?  I ran right out and rented ""A Member of the Wedding,"" ""The Haunting,"" ""East of Eden"" and ""I Am a Camera.""  However, it is ""The Belle of Amherst"" which remains dearest to my heart.  Such a loving portrait.  A bravura performance which earned the actress her fifth Tony Award for Best Actress, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording.  This is a must for poetry lovers and theatre lovers alike.",1090195200,9,534,4.568421052631579
620637,5,6303312381,"This astonishing video performance of Julie Harris' one-woman show about poetess Emily Dickinson's life and work is a true tour-de-force. Ms. Harris' range of expression both physically and vocally evokes Emily Dickinson so precisely that one can hardly imagine that she ever looked or sounded any other way. The poems which are featured in this script are so deftly and subtly interwoven that the entire presentation feels seamless and eminently REAL. I am a Theatre Arts/Speech teacher at a small High School in Virginia, and my students are perpetually astonished at the humor and relevance of a video made more than twenty years ago - usually, they want to tune out anything ""old"". This is a rich and sumptuous piece of living literature with a tremendously broad appeal - not just Dickinson's poetry, but her unique life is showcased in this privileged interview. This is EXACTLY the kind of ""living literature"" that we need most in our homes and in our schools - by bringing authors and works of note to life, we can perpetuate the essential reverence for the power of the written word which has perenially distinguished our culture. Please don't let the relatively high price of this product deter you - it is an investment which will repay itself many times over!",942105600,51,1271,4.916279069767442

620738,5,6303312381,So glad to see this available again. A tour de force performance of an exquisitely written play; Harris portrays the essence of the subject's character. Dickinson's poetry is seamlessly woven into the script and delivered as if it were prose. A classic portrait of this reclusive poet.,1466726400,,285,5.085106382978723
620739,4,6303312381,A recording of a one-woman play by a young Julie Harris about Emily Dickinson - various Dickinson poems are woven into the plot of the play to give illustration to her life.  A quiet tribute.,1466294400,,191,4.457142857142857
620740,5,6303312381,"If you love words, particularly ones to ""lift your hat to""  like ""phosphorescent,"" or even very simple words, like ""buttercup,"" and you relish being in the company of a witty, a bit wacky, wise, eloquent, down-to-earth and  gifted artist (both Emily  and Julie), reward yourself  with this theater. I wasn't looking for this, and when I found it, I expected it to be an old biopic (of course a term not yet coined). Well it's a video of a 1976 one-woman play starring Julie Harris (even confusing the name with Julie Andrews) based on the life of the solitary poet Emily Dickinson. Still only mildy interested, I decided to stay a while. It's brilliant!  Written by William Luce and directed by Charles Nelson Reilly, it's filled with wonderful morsels of insight and sprinkled with lovely poetry which often drifts seamlessly back into conversation.  And about conversation, ED is seen as shy, reclusive, isolated.  Today she might be diagnosed as socially phobic or even agoraphobic--  for decades she never leaves her home or garden, she says. And as is the case with many folks who fear social interaction, she doesn't realize how wonderful and winning she is. The audience serves as her first encounter (fictional, but it doesn't play that way), in probably half her life, with a room full of people, and she states that and engages us in that way. Julie Harris is luminous and exciting in this role.  In her reenactment of  exchanges with various individuals, she so aptly and credibly speaks only her half of the conversation or does impressions of the other. And in that, the writer and director deserve many lifted hats.",1466035200,3,1629,4.8483754512635375

621052,5,6303312381,"Emily Dickinson is my most favorite poet and this play performed byJulie Harris was absolutely perfect!  It was less than two hours long but I wanted it to go on and on.  Bravo to the writer who wrote the words and used the words and thoughts and poems of the poet.  Even someone without the knowledge and background of the poet...who perhaps even have never read the poetry would enjoy this play so well acted and so well written.  I think that this video should be marketed to high school English teachers with deep discounts so that students could visualize and hear the words!  As a fromer English teacher, I know the importance of bringing poetry to the souls of students.  When we moved to a new city, years ago, I ""subbed"" untill I found a permenant teaching position...the students were reading the poetry of Emily Dickinson and I decided to read to them and stop and asked them what ""she was thinking of"" when she wrote that line...  I was surprised when they talked about her satire!  Her satire???  Well, several said that their teacher had said that Emily wrote satire.  Satire?  I am glad that I never met their teacher.  I told the class that day that just for that day, we will read several poems and then they can express what they individually felt what was written.  But I digress....this video of the play ""The Belle of Amherst"" was perfection.",1443139200,,1363,4.559670781893004

621110,4,6303312381,"I reduce this rating to four stars for just one reason, its technical faults owing to the primitive source material, all that was available.  In every other respect this is brilliant, not a usual thing for a direct translation from the stage to television.
  Julie Harris may be the finest American actress of our time, as Emily Dickinson was certainly among the most brilliant American poets of her time.  Among pre-twentieth century American poets, she can be compared only to her contemporary Walt Whitman.  It's reasonable to suppose that she knew of his work, but the reverse supposition would be a stretch, since her poetry was published much later than his.
  As for Harris, not only was she the ideal person to portray Dickinson, but her portrayal is riveting.  A recluse through most of her adult life, Dickinson in person might not have been such an attention-holding woman, but Harris makes the right choices to render her irresistible.  Thus Dickinson and Harris come together here in a way that is not only worthwhile, but also highly entertaining.",1428969600,,1061,4.9491525423728815

621290,5,6303312381,"In one of the first one-man (or in this case, one-woman) shows that surfaced after the success of Hal Holbrook;s Mark Twain, Julie Harris shines as the literary eccentric, Emily Dickinson.

Her vocal theatricality when reveling in the performance of Dickinson's beautiful lyric poems reminds one of the finest Shakespearean actors speaking to the heavens and to God him (or her) self.  Its clear to see how Ms. Harris (the original Sally Bowles in her first Tony-winning role, ""I Am A Camera"") won her one of her five Tony Awards (out of 10 nominations) for this role, a record she held until Angela Lansbury & Audra MacDonald tied her only recently.

The dialogue is exquisitely written by William Luce, slyly using Ms. Dickinson's poety to emphasize or comment on a passage of the poet's life.  The stage direction by Charles Nelson Reilly is brilliant - so full of details, yet so simple, flowing majestically from one beat to the next, guiding the audience through Ms. Dickinson's life and work effortlessly. The costumes & set are spot on, evocative of the time and used wisely in each and every scene.

Treat yourself to something unique and special, a one-woman show worth its weight in gold before every self-involved out-of-work actor in Hollywood decided their lives were interesting enough to spill on the boards of every black box in LA.  This is a show about a legend by a legend.  You will feel your spirit rise for just the watching of it.",1400371200,,1454,4.792
621291,5,6303312381,"Somehow or other I haven't read Emily Dickenson, though I've read other great poets.  I was simply astonished by her words and personhood, as channeled by Julie Harris.  I was riveted from beginning to end, alternating between laughing and crying.  Simply wonderful.

So besotted was I with her poetry that I immediately downloaded&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-COMPLETE-POEMS-OF-EMILY-DICKENSON/dp/B00E3G7L0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE COMPLETE POEMS OF EMILY DICKENSON</a>&nbsp;for kindle, edited by Thomas Johnson, considered the best (in chronological order and with ""the look"" of the poems, including her unusual punctuation, intact).  NOT the kindle version with ""analysis and historical background"", which, from reading the reviews, are apparently not her poems as she wrote them.  [Added later: Debated whether I should add this, but I will: for me, the very BEST and most appealing of her poetry is included in this film production.  I read the entire book, and though obviously brilliant and utterly unique, I can't say that the bulk of it particularly resonated with me, tastes in such things are highly individual and deeply personal, of course.  That fact in no way detracts from the splendor of this film depiction of Dickenson's life and personhood.]

The early portions of the Harris performance revealed a side of Emily much different from the ""recluse"" label applied to her by insensitive writers.  Based on intensive research, Emily had a great sense of humor, but did not go overboard in mixing with local socialites because small talk based on local happenings were less interesting than what was floating around in her own mind.  Harris revealed the pain Emily went through when her poetry was evaluated by those who failed to understand cutting edge originality.  Harris also revealed that although Emily bypassed local male masters of small talk, she had huge but futile crushes on accomplished men of national fame who were already married.

I know the current trend in singing is loud, belting voices that scream with amplified assistance and that films focus on psychosis and behavioral isms as if we have all been there. There is none of that in this story. This is an intimate conversation, the kind we used to have with each other before we learned to bury our heads in our smart phones. This is a conversation with someone who has the courage to share what frightens them and what makes them sad and what delights them in life.

Seeing and hearing a great actress present a flesh and blood portrait of the poet as she was in life is pure pleasure.
  In school we got an impression of Emily Dickenson as a spooky old maid, hiding behind closed curtains, scribbling poems that she crammed into every niche in the house and becoming the poster girl for the unfulfilled life. What fun to find out that there was far, far more there to be seen.
  It is obvious that Julie Harris loves her subject. She breathes life into the sad old only photo of Dickinson. And what life! Here is a passionate, educated woman fully in touch with the world and her times. She is a poet down to her fingertips, mad for the magic of words. Poems, stories, observations and insights gush forth. The poems are woven into the monologue in a seamless fashion. Nothing seems arch or strained. Hearing the poetry in this context lends new meaning.
  I doubt that there are very many actresses who could take on this role. In the first few minutes, Julie Harris drops away, replaced by Emily. And Emily she stays until the final lines and even into the ovations. The poet comes across as a person with a good idea of who she is and what her creative talents can do.

621481,3,6303312381,"This is a one-woman stage show performance that has been filmed. If we were part of the theatre audience we would have seen Julie Harris as a three-dimensional figure and the stage props as guides and supports to her performance. As a cinema product, the effect is strictly two-dimensional and the stage props are, if anything, impediments to our imagination. Harris gives a forceful and nuanced reading, and I suppose there is a case that can be made for preserving it on film for students of the craft. Whether the play itself is that good, I have my doubts. Clever and amusing it may be, but the portrait of Emily Dickinson conjured up seems too flirtatious and dizzy for the writer of the cool and measured verse we know and love. But each to his own conception.

621486,5,6303312381,"THE BELLE OF AMHERST is one of those artistic gems that is no less brilliant for seeming somewhat imperfectly faceted. By this I mean that I disagree with the dramatist's interpretation of Emily Dickinson's personality, but love the play anyway for the sake of Julie Harris' star turn performance and for the script's being essentially a quiltwork of pithy quotes and juicy anecdotes drawn directly from The Divine Emily's life and works.

My problem is with the depiction of Emily as neurotically, almost pathologically, shy, nerdishly awkward, scatterbrained, giddily unsure of herself... none of which seems to match the historical Emily I have come over time to understand and love. Unfortunately, the play's interpretation is based mainly on the only extensive account of what the mature Emily was like, as recorded by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, literary style-and-form czar of his day, as a very conventional-minded authority who seemed to find the poetess and her creations about equally baffling. My cavil is that this was not the true Emily, but rather an Emily hopelessly unnerved and overwhelmed by her meeting, after years of futile poem submissions and correspondence, with this great literary eminence grise, as obtusely unsympathetic arbiter of the worldly fate of all that was most precious to Emily, namely her poetry.

Higginson was a well-schooled ""expert"" in matters of poetry. Emily was, by contrast, a genius, born with a magical ability to compose the stuff that Higginson was an expert in, but otherwise almost completely unschooled in it. The situation there was peculiarly American; America loves and trusts its experts, rewarding them for the work and dedication they have put into their life-business, but it neither understands nor loves nor trusts its geniuses, whose natural-born accomplishment in the same fields is so invidiously undemocratic as to set one man, the walk-on born genius, so strangely and unjustly above another, the schooled expert, thus threatening the very fabric of our whole received ideology of human equality and merit. It seems an irony that might otherwise have amused Emily that this great literary lion, only remembered today for his connection with her, should thus be given the last word on what sort of person she was. Paradoxically, it is partly the fault of Emily herself, whose will had called for her letters to be burnt after her death, that we know far too little about what the ordinary world made of her, for which the incidental testimony of a Higginson seems a peculiarly unhappy substitute.

A broader view of the essential living Emily persona, inferrable from the testimony of her own works taken together with the incidentally preserved scattered comments of people who knew her well, might seem to paint a different picture: Emily Dickinson was, albeit eccentric, eminently sane, for one thing. Her normal social personality was bubbly, outgoing, spontaneously improvisational and pawkishly witty, poised, ""posed"" and sharply and sensitively focused, rather than scatterbrained, and somewhat too puppyishly affectionate toward people she loved, which seemed to be, at least in her youth, practically every respectable and even sometimes disrespectable person she met. Her main flaw, if flaw it be, was the tendency of her natural precocity to make her personally overwhelming. As long as she was entertaining a crowd, such as with her storytelling fugues and singing and piano improvisations, Emily was fine. One-on-one with her natural energies and maxim-gun wit, on the other hand, for any length of time, could doubtless be, for the feebler sensibilities of most ordinary folks, a mentally and spiritually taxing experience, to say the least.

Emily, of course, came to understand this over time... which is why she

gradually withdrew from a world that she loved, yet came to feel born into by accident, on the wrong planet. People like to imagine Emily's reclusion as somehow pathological, inspired by a jilted love affair or some such ordinary soap-operatic trauma, because they forget that she was a genius, and that geniuses simply don't think or act or make choices like the rest of us. Emily was jilted alright... by the ordinary world she loved so much, despite its hopeless ""common"" ordinariness. The main culprit here seems to have been evangelical Christianity, which swept its frenzied waves through her world time and again, picking off her family and friends one by one and exerting such tremendous social pressures to accept Jesus and be saved. Emily, seeing through the maudlin hysterical banality of the whole business and already betrothed as bride to the Jesus of her genius, simply couldn't stoop, for mere social acceptance's sake, to chiming in on the same kinds of convenient hypocrisies as all those church-ladies with their ""dimity convictions,"" or the platoons of ham-fisted preachers who ""argued themselves narrow"" and ""made God's love seem like bears.""

The curse of Christianity of this sort is that it is an importuning ideology of the sort that poorer souls seem to thrive on but which Emily's keener instinct found most gratuitously repulsive, much the way a dog's keener hearing will find insufferable sounds that we humans can't even hear. Ideologies systematically exclude and shun the unwashed, which is what happened to Emily, as Salvation wrapped its tentacles around her social circles, costing her one ""love"" after another in a dizzying succession of spiritual alienations. This circumstance seems too underappreciated by critics, most likely because Emily, the farthest thing from a whiner or complainer, says so little about it directly herself. Her work, however, says a great deal about it indirectly, artistically, subversively, accumulating to a damning mass of seemingly dispositive evidence, once one knows to start looking for it.

In her art, Emily often manages to reinvent the English language. In her lifestyle, she managed to retreat to an artistically reinvented world where she could ""tell all the truth but tell it slant."" Pathological? only to the extent that eyesight might be considered ""pathological"" in a world of the blind, or in a world that includes, in our tally of human pathologies, such syndromes as uncanny instinct and towering eldritch genius.",1159660800,24,6296,5.258706467661692
621487,5,6303312381,"I saw this on PBS back around 1979, and it started a frustrating love affair with the poet which culminated in my writing a play which is kind of a sequal to this. I corresponded with the playwright, William Luce, and with Richard Sewall, Emily's most respected biographer. I have come to see that Bill Luce's portrait of Dickinson may not be a faithful exhibit of her real personality, but as an introduction to her thoughts it serves a good purpose. Julie Harris is superb, of course. If you want a painless way to get to know the background of Emily's life, this is it.",1158192000,8,572,4.457142857142857
621488,5,6303312381,"Of all the highlights of Julie Harris' illustrious career, ""The Belle of Amherst "" is her masterpiece. This extraordinary one-woman, two act play by William Luce is exquisitely written and laced with Emily Dickinson's poetry, and is by turns hilarious, as she tells us the small town gossip, to profound and moving, when she speaks of her poetry, her parents, and Dr. Charles Wadsworth, a preacher that captured her heart and soul.
It takes place when Emily, who was born in 1830, is 53 years old, and she invites the viewer into her home, and describes in wonderfully staged vignettes, the many phases of her life. Dickinson was unknown during her lifetime, and was a recluse, but said ""I never had to go anywhere to find my paradise"".

You will get the recipe for her famous Black Bread, which has as ingredients: 2 lbs. each flour, butter, and sugar, 19 eggs, 5 lbs. raisins, 1  lbs. each currants and citron,  pt. each brandy and molasses, 2 nutmegs, 5 tsp. cloves, mace and cinnamon, 2 tsp. soda, and 2 pinches of salt. I have tasted this Black Bread (which is more like a fruit cake), and it's delicious !

Julie Harris is ""The First Lady of the American Theater"", with a record five Tony Awards with her name on them, as well as an Oscar nomination and 10 Emmy nominations. Ms. Harris has captivated many an audience with her impassioned performances, and her portrayal of Emily Dickinson is as if they shared the same heart; this is a unique theatrical experience, directed by Charles Durbin, and filmed live in a small theater in 1976.

This was a gift from a generous soul, to whom I am very grateful, and this film would be equally treasured by anyone who appreciates poetry and Ms. Harris' magical talent. ""The Belle of Amherst"" would also be an excellent study tool for literature and women's study groups, as well as drama students.

7843063,5,6303312381,"If Helen Hayes was the first lady of American theater, I'd nominate Julie Harris in second, third, and fourth place. ""The Belle of Amherst,"" videotaped before a live audience, is a reproduction of her celebrated performance of Emily Dickinson from the 1970s. Thank heaven someone taped this gem for posterity. The set design, minimalist yet cluttered with bric-a-brac, and the lighting set the proper atmosphere. Charles Dubin's direction is capable but a bit flat: for at least some of the performance's punctuation marks, I wish he'd more often (If ever) set a camera in close-up on the performer's face. There's no music here, save that of Miss Harris's slightly high-pitched voice, which I'd bet was a deliberate choice: she's trying to convey, vocally, the exuberance of a life that in so many ways was stunted beyond her subject's complete control. As with all one-actor recitations, everything depends on the range and versatility of the solo performer, and Miss Harris gives us something radiant. She plays her voice and body like a fine instrument: nothing wasted, nothing histrionic, everything right in sync with the character's moodswhich often turn on a dime. The clever script by William Luce seamless blends Dickinson's thoughts (based on surviving diaries and letters) with some of her most memorable, loveliest verse. Down to the smallest details no effort is spared to make of this performance something special: afterwards, when the actress returns onstage with her obligatory bouquet, she gently lays it on a the box containing Dickinson's scraps of poetry, deflecting the credit away from herself and onto the poet. Then, as an encore, she pronounces, in another of Dickinson's poems, a benediction on the now standing audience.

As the blessed owner of many recorded solo performancesHolbrook's Twain, McCowen's St. Mark, Fonda's Darrow, Plummer's BarrymoreI would put Miss Harris's Dickinson at or near the very top.

Be warned that Kino, the DVD's manufacturer, has done its best to reproduce an image whose quality varies, especially at the beginning and end. This, I believe, in no fault of Kino: they did the best they could with the elements available to them and the budget they had for its restoration.
