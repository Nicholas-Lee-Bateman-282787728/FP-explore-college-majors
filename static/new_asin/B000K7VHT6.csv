2683971,5,B000K7VHT6,"all three are top notch comedy in keeping with steve Martin's style of humor. If you like any of these try ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"".",1247270400,3,140,4.64
2683972,3,B000K7VHT6,"The idea was really good....all three of the movies were good in
the theater.  However,when I recevied the DVDs,  Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid was defective. This is the only reason for the 3-star rating.  Had to return the collection.  However, could not be more pleased with Amazon's return policy...they were very prompt; I had no trouble at all.  Have ordered many items from Amazon, and will continue to to so.",1241654400,3,412,4.746478873239437
2683973,1,B000K7VHT6,"Before I see this set of the 3 movies,( DEAD MEN DONT WEAR PLAID, THE JERK AND LONELY GUY) I loved all the Steve Martin's movies I had seen, but those movies disappointment, it doesn't have nothing interesting. The topic of the 3 movies are ridiculous,boring and exaggerated.
No way! I do not recommend it.",1240358400,,306,4.581818181818182

2683975,3,B000K7VHT6,"Three movies on two DVDs - don't know why they didn't just use 3 DVD - guess it saved a few pennies.
Great classic Steve Martin flicks!",1237161600,4,135,4.037037037037037
2683976,5,B000K7VHT6,"This is a five star rating of three DVDs as a bargain, which is different from rating each movie as a five star movie.

In this collection of three movies done early in his acting career, Steve Martin is cast in roles taking advantage of his unique forms of comedy, slapstick, and sophistication.  We have:

- **** Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (with its use of cameos from other films and the infamous ""Friends and Enemies of Carlotta"" list),

- ***** The Jerk (a cult classic... ""He hates cans!), and

- *** The Lonely Guy ( the sleeper... literally something in between the comedy of The Jerk and ""seriousness"" of Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid).

The weaker movie of the three is The Lonely Guy, a movie of the Neil Simon play, but if you consider it a freebie in this collection, there's no complaint!",1198022400,19,797,4.462068965517242

2683982,4,B000K7VHT6,"A worthwhile collection if you are a fan of Steve Martin's work. The dvd quality is good, including sound and picture.

Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is absolutely hilarious.

The Jerk and The Lonely Guy were both a bit too goofy and stupid for me to really enjoy but I know they are favs for a lot of Steve Martin fans.

But for the price, this collection is a bargain.",1426377600,,366,4.2

2683995,3,B000K7VHT6,"I had seen a compilation on youtube of the Dead men don't wear plaid funniest scenes.  I should have stuck with that.  The movie is wholly unwatchable.  the funny scenes are still funny, but the whole thing is just poorly done.",1398988800,,227,4.487804878048781
2683996,5,B000K7VHT6,"I am glad I bought this dvd set. It contains three of steve martins early films from the 1980s. Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid being my favorite. I like the simple presentation,the price couldn't be better.",1396828800,,201,4.611111111111111
2683997,5,B000K7VHT6,Bought this specifically for the Jerk.  Can't say too much about the other 2 movies but the Jerk is in my top 10 favs of all time.  The price is right and you get 2 other movies for free.,1396742400,,187,3.769230769230769
2683998,5,B000K7VHT6,The Jerk is one of my favorites!  It's a good set at a good price. Fast shipping helped seal the deal,1395878400,,101,3.8095238095238093

2684000,5,B000K7VHT6,"I bought this set to enjoy with my family. We had a really great time watching these Steve Martin classics.

The package is your typical DVD multi-pack.

It's a good set of movies for the price.",1371254400,,194,4.361111111111111
2684001,4,B000K7VHT6,I like all these movies and it was a good price to get all three together. It would have cost more for sure trying to buy them all separately.,1369094400,2,142,3.9310344827586206
2684002,5,B000K7VHT6,The Jerk was the best. I forgot how funny this film was from way back when I first saw it. The lonely Guy was another gem that I forgot all about too. Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid was very good in its own way too. I had never seen that one before. Money well spent. Steve is the Wildest & Craziest Guy!,1365552000,2,299,3.838709677419355
2684003,5,B000K7VHT6,Watched all three of them the first saturday after I got them. I loved them. This guy is so funny.,1357948800,,98,3.95
2684004,5,B000K7VHT6,I like almost all of Steve Martins movies and these are some of his earlier movies when he was still the wild and crazy guy.  It's a good price for a three movie collection.  A good value.,1356739200,,188,4.054054054054054

2684006,5,B000K7VHT6,"I don't know , but is it just me ...or does anybody else out there feel like the comedies of the past are better with age??? When i first saw this movie , i didn't care for it. Now i think it is funnier.  The quality of film is fine , but to be honest , when i saw it before, i was watching a old cable hook up , with low quality. The acting is funny , and i like the situations he gets into. It's a little bit more than i would show a young child , but compared to todays ""comedies"" , it is tame. Just funny how the movie is aged , and got better, or is it just me.? By the way , i am speaking of the JERK, the other 2 movies are pretty good to:)",1345766400,,647,3.556338028169014
2684007,3,B000K7VHT6,"I brought this set because the price was good and for Dead Man Don't Wear Plaid, a clever smart movie
that really wasn't appreciated by most.
I have seen the movie on cable and the picture was excellent, unfortunately that is not the case with
the version in this release.  This version looks like it was shot through cheesecloth.
The print was not cleaned up at all, there are various artifacts throughout.
The picture quality for all the movies in this set is at most fair.
See other reviewers comments for the plot lines to the movies.
I don't know why The Lonely Guy is in this set, it should have been The Man With Two Brains.
The movies in the Wild and Crazy collection are at least anamorphic widescreen.
Ended purchasing Dead Man Don't Wear Plaid with out the other movies and while the picture is better,
the movie is widescreen, but not anamorphic widescreen (16 x 9 enhanced).
That means there are bars along the sides as well as the top and bottom.
Too many times there is very little if any information about the quality of the movies.
It should be a requirement that companies provide that information.",1343520000,14,1116,4.552238805970149
2684008,4,B000K7VHT6,I saw The Jerk years ago and Believe it has gotten even better over the years .  So glad I got my own copy. Plus two others....What a deal ...,1338854400,,142,3.7333333333333334

8154868,5,B000K7VHT6,What needs to be said?  If you like Steve Martin you could watch Dead Men or The Jerk a million times and still think they're funny.  For the cost of the box set it comes out to less than a penny per laugh.  Of course if you don't like Steve Martin then you don't think anything is funny and you should buy this set so you could have one more thing to complain about.,1495411200,,367,3.9324324324324325
