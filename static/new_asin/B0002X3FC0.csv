Little by little, I've gotten back into Yoga with these two videos. I cannot thank the Maskins enough for putting these videos out there. They have helped me tremendously from regaining mobility to helping with depression. I love them and will be forever grateful! Thank You Charles and Lisa!
Love,

Charles and Lisa Matkin are very clear with their instructions and very soothing with their music and voices. I recommend these to anyone, especially someone who is just starting with yoga like I was when I purchased them.",1291680000,,291,4.938775510204081
