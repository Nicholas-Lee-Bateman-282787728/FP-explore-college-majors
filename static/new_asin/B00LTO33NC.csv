6505167,4,B00LTO33NC,"When my children were little, the Beethoven movies came out; my family enjoyed them and found them to be family-friendly and family-enjoyable! So, when I was invited to review a new Beethoven movie in exchange for writing my opinion of the movie, I thought it sounded like fun and hoped for it to once again be family-friendly and family-friendly. I'm happy to say, it is definitely both those and makes a fun option for a stocking stuffer, gift exchange or gift this Christmas - or for a family movie night choice!

Beethoven's Treasure Tail
Studio - Universal Studios
Rating - PG

Favorite Features -
Family fun - Josiah and Caleb thought it was funny and came to my ""rescue"" by blocking my vision when the spiders showed up!
While the story is somewhat predictable, it is a lot of fun, children and adults will find themselves laughing and enjoying the time they spent watching it together.
Solid messages about not giving up, teasing others, family and standing up for what is right
Universal Studios says; ""Get ready to howl with laughter in this all-new family comedy starring America's favorite St. Bernard, the one and only Beethoven! After a doggone disaster of a movie shoot, the big-hearted pooch and his trainer, Eddie, are heading home when they get stranded in a small coastal village. When Beethoven befriends a local boy, he helps him find a pirate map to lost treasure and together they em-bark on an adventure which brings the whole town together. Beethoven's Treasure Tail is a heartwarming ""tail"" about finding fun wherever your nose leads you.""

I enjoyed watching Beethoven's Treasure Tail with my grandsons; we now plan to go back and watch the original and some of the following Beethoven movies as well!",1413417600,3,1728,4.850847457627118

6505196,1,B00LTO33NC,"I wish I could give it 0 stars. My IQ dropped below 10 from watching this movie. Also, the main child character's every other word is ""stupid"", his mom says ""crap"" a lot, and they also mention ""idiotic dog"", etc. Save your money and time, and look for something else to do for your family.",1417305600,4,289,4.2727272727272725
6505197,3,B00LTO33NC,"Beethoven and his trainer Eddie end up in O'Malley's Cove where they meet a young boy and his mother. The boy has a dream to find the treasure his father told him about before he passed away.

What I love most about this movie is how Beethoven says so much without uttering a single word. His face shows such emotion.

I enjoyed the moments of Beethoven and Sam as they ventured out together. Beethoven either passing gas in Sam's face or saving his life. I'd say that makes for some laughs. Kids will appreciate the little Indiana Jones type moments as Sam heads into a spider web filled cave and ends up with a large spider on him.

Morgan Fairchild makes an appearance as Eddie and Beethoven's manager Charlene.

The moral of this story is never give up your dreams and you never know where you will meet your next best friend.",1415577600,,830,4.440789473684211
