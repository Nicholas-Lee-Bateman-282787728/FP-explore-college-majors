7905639,2,B000009Q50,"THE GRAND SUBSTITUTION (1965) is a costume melodrama set in ancient China which qualifies as an operetta thanks to numerous sequences where the dialogue and exposition are sung by the characters, rather than spoken. The intricate plot focuses on court intrigue in which a tyrannical government minister, seeking to solidify his influence on a young Duke, seeks to discredit the Prince Consort and wipe out his family, including the infant heir. Through a complicated maneuver by friends of the Prince Consort, which involves the heart-wrenching sacrifice of a family friend and another friend's baby, the infant prince is saved and raised by the court doctor who is invited to live in the palace and raise the son amidst luxurious surroundings. When the baby prince has grown to young manhood, he finds out the truth from his real mother and turns against the minister who had grown to look on the boy as his own son.
What's interesting about the casting is that it draws on Chinese theatrical tradition by having the teenaged prince played by actress Ivy Ling Po, one of the top stars at the time at the Shaw Bros. studio where this was filmed. (She played female roles in her other films, including the Jimmy Wang Yu swordplay adventure, TWIN SWORDS.) This is a colorful and beautifully filmed studio production, but it's a highly overwrought melodrama from another time and serves as a link to an earlier era of Chinese entertainment. I would recommend this for students of Chinese cultural history and Hong Kong film completists, but it might be a tough sell for others.  Like most 1960s Hong Kong films available on tape in the U.S., the film is transferred full-frame, which means that the subtitles are cut off on the sides.",989193600,,1731,4.867796610169491
