2675022,5,B000JJSKWM,Robert Carlyle was awesome. This movie had me wondering untiil the ending. Well directed and acted. This movie is a must for Robert Carlyle or mystery movie collectors.,1267315200,,168,5.035714285714286
2675023,2,B000JJSKWM,"There are many good things about this two-part film; the beautiful scenery and good photography, the accomplished acting of the entire cast, and the slow plotting and build-up of suspense, for example.  But these unfortunately are not enough to make this film a success.
The main fault is first the writers's and secondly the director's.  To heighten the suspense, I guess, the author has added a number of Gothic elements that cumulatively distract and annoy rather than add to the mystery and suspense.  While on the case, revisiting the different scenes of the crimes, Inspector Monroe sees flashes of images: are they real people, real visions, or pictures from his own imagination?  As these persist and grow more frequent, they become irritating and wearying rather than increasing the mystery.  Moreover, the Inspector wanders about, twirls around 360 degrees, and twirls again, supposedly to see if there really is someone there; very poor direction here, I believe, that makes the main character appear ridiculous rather than  wise and probing.  The denoument is very unsatisfactory - with the flash disappearance of one of the main characters and her flash reappearance a good distance away, with a very unrealistic unwinding of the mystery by means of more Gothic elements, such as the slow mounting of staircases and the climbing of an extended ladder from an attic, leading into who knows what danger.  The final solution and explanation of the many deaths from both past (1976) and present (1995) is not very clear: one has to rethink and try to puzzle them out after the film is over.  Moreover, there is just too sudden and too great a change of character in the person revealed as the villain at the end.  The change in character is just not credible - it simply could not be the same person we have been watching through the film.  Sadly, I have to admit that the film is really a Gothic failure, unsatisfactory - and annoyingly so because I really wanted it to succeeed.

There are too a number of technical weaknesses. The first and foremost is that no English subtitles are provided.  This is a big mistake: the accents are often so pronounced and the dialogue delivered at such a rapid conversational pace that it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to decipher what is said.  Even re-running the disc (not so easy to do with a dvd disc) often does not clear up the problem. Subtitles would have been a tremendous help. Secondly, the only extra provided is a trailer, which is no help at all towards understanding and appreciating the film.",1214352000,4,2566,4.86896551724138
2675024,5,B000JJSKWM,"A man is killed by a truck on a free way and at first everyone is saying that the dead man, Pat FISHER was clearly suffering some sort of mental breakdown.

Even the local police think that it nothing more than a terrible tragedy but Detective Tom Monroe (Robert Carlyle, The Full Monty) is not so sure that Pat's death is so cut and dried, especially when he finds newspaper clippings, some old school photos including a group photo taken in 1976 where one of the children's face is blurred and no one can remember who he/she is, not even one of the teachers who taught at the school.

Monroe soon discovers that there are other mysterious deaths among the children in the school photo he he finds in Pat's belongings and that his old friend's strange words on a tape recording that ""they have all been murdered"" might just have an element of truth in it and with this in mind Monroe sets about finding out the horrific truth about the Class of 76.

This is a really suspenseful film which makes you physically jump on more than one occasion, in fact I found it really creepy at times, and though the ending is not quite what you expect, you do understand what has happened even if you don't quite believe it.",1173830400,7,1210,4.417040358744394

8151501,5,B000JJSKWM,"Really, really good television. Very suspenseful. Is this a ghost story or a straight out murder? It's never quite answered which only adds to the enjoyment. Excellent acting, beautifully photographed.",1422489600,,201,5.733333333333333

8151503,5,B000JJSKWM,"I really enjoyed this movie. It has beautiful scenery, wonderful videography, and great acting. It has suspense and some rather creepy scenes. You don't know what might happen. I am a huge Robert Carlyle fan, and this is a must. I loved him in it. As it is a true british film, some may find it slow. I happened to enjoy the pace and found it just right for the story.

8151504,5,B000JJSKWM,"Very well acted, of course. Really nice development, great timing, and a very good twist that even I, a writer, did not expect. Well worth getting.",1368057600,,147,4.6923076923076925
8151505,5,B000JJSKWM,"Not a whole lot to surprise if you are a fan of the genre, which of course I am.  Of course, Robert Carlyle (as usual) does a great job and makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable.",1341964800,,187,3.9210526315789473

8151507,4,B000JJSKWM,"I thought this was a pretty decent piece.  As usual, Robert Carlyle delivers fine acting as he portrays an inspector who seemingly chases his own personal ghosts as he investigates the murder of several classmates of a class of '76.  While there's nothing ""touching"" about it, I found the plot to move fluidly, the characters true to form.  I also found myself wondering as I neared the end what would happen and ""whodunit"".  So it was worth the few bucks' rental to get a good Carlyle fix.  He never lets me down.",1330819200,12,514,4.543478260869565
8151508,2,B000JJSKWM,"This is the type of movie that the Brits do better than anyone -- carefully paced, beautifully filmed, ethereal, and just a little bit haunting (or maybe, haunted).  Usually I really enjoy this type of flick; I'm patient & easily seduced by atmosphere and pretty scenes.  And the shots of Stirling, Scotland really are pretty (this area was home to William Wallace, aka Braveheart, in the 13th century).

But MONROE is long... I mean really long.  And slow, really slow. So by the time the end slowly crept up on me, I was oh so sleepy.  For me, there's just a little too much careful pacing and atmosphere.  Once in awhile, something (anything!) needs to happen... besides another elegantly-framed, bloodless death (there are a bunch of those).

I watched to the end, but I was pretty bored by then.  Maybe that's just me... or maybe you, if you're not up for a long (two-part) BBC mystery that unfolds... slowly.

You decide for yourself.",1305936000,,940,4.717791411042945
