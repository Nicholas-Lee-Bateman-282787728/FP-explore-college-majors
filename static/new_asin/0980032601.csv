They said we would be getting 3 CD's, 3 DVD's, 3 Reference manuals and a roll up pad for 2 payments of 19.95. Turned out we got one CD, one DVD one manual and a paper poster that is supposed to be the music pad. It took 2 months to get it on backorder and then they charged me 10.00 in shipping and handling to cheat me.

Had they just told the truth, I probably would have still bought it, but I hate to be lied to.",1282089600,9,546,3.918918918918919
7794945,5,0980032601,"We purchased this DVD last week and it arrived in Saturday's mail. By last night (Tuesday night), our 13-year-old daughter had already worked through all the songs on the first DVD and is well into the second DVD of Level 1. (The video teacher constantly urges students to go slowly to master the tunes, but she has spent quite a bit of time with it and is catching on quickly.)

I had tried teaching her from my old piano books years ago, but she quickly lost interest in the ""reading based"" method of music, with their boring tunes and the complexity of trying to learn to read music and play at the same time. Now she is thrilled to be able to sit down at the piano and actually play real music!

One side note: Some people have convictions against rock/jazz/blues style music. (No offense to those who don't, but I know quite a few who do.) This method employs a lot of those styles in the method, but it also has quite a few songs that are not. It is possible to skip over the blues pieces and learn the other songs. There is enough here to give a child (or an adult) a taste of success and help them get past that fear that piano is too hard to learn. It's hard to put a price tag on that!",1266364800,11,1195,4.1688311688311686
