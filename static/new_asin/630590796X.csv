7898832,3,630590796X,"Not as good as the earlier German masterpieces, Dr. Mabuse der Speiler and the Testament of Dr. Mabuse.  This version was more expensive to buy in the German with English subtitles.  I had bought the English dubbed version first, and it was terrible, the voices loud and jarring.  However, getting the German version didn't do much to make it better.  I believe not having Thea von Harbou as part of the production may have been part of the problem.  (note Lang always seems to have taken full credit for his films but von Harbou was I believe his muse in the early days and her contribution has often been overlooked.  But having read more of Lang's biography it is clear that his style of running things did not jibe with Hollywood and his eyesight was failing badly from his glaucoma and a botched surgery, so he was prevented from being able to do as much as he might have otherwise.  But no matter, the story falls kind of flat, even with the references to the earlier films such as shooting the victim on a busy street in an almost exact configuration of the earlier works.
I definitely recommend the first two as well as Metropolis wholeheartedly.",1416787200,,1154,4.572815533980583

7898834,5,630590796X,"Of the twelve Dr. Mabuse movies, Fritz Lane made three. This was his last movie of his career. (He died not long after it's completion.) Of all the Mabuse movies this is by far the best. If you understand the mind of Fritz Lang and his hatred of the Natzis you will appricate the location. The Hotel Luxor is a hotel built by the Natzs with hidden cameras and recording devices to house foreign dignitaries in Berlin. Mabusa is dead but he is channeled through...well I won't spoil the mystery you have to buy it to find out.",1399075200,,525,4.36734693877551
7898835,5,630590796X,"Fritz Lang comes full circle:  MABUSE made his name nearly forty years earlier with the silent serial DR. MABUSE, DER SPIELER (1922), and here Mabuse closes out his directorial career, in his home country Germany.  Made on a shoestring budget with pretty obviously cardboard-quality sets, this is nonetheless nearly up to the level of the director's finest work, the fatalism and paranoia, the distrust of government and big business every bit as potent if not more so in the era of TV and jet aircraft as it was in the years before Hitler came to power.

The plot is so complex and takes so many quick turns that, less than 2 weeks after seeing it, I'm already at a loss to readily describe it. Suffice it to say that a TV reporter dies in his car in traffic; at first, no foul play is suspected but soon it's found that he has a needle embedded in his brain, fired from some experimental weapon. Meanwhile a young woman connected with the anchorman tries to commit suicide -- she is saved by an American businessman, who soon becomes embroiled in the intrigue which in addition to an SF weapon involves 1-way mirrors, cameras watching nearly everyone's every move, a seer/magician and exploding telephones. Really, describing the plot would ruin much of the fun.

Gert Frobe is really excellent as the police inspector in charge of the case; like a great many Americans I know him only as ""Goldfinger"" but he shows great ability here as a world-weary but still committed, intelligent and canny cop. The rest of the cast is solid, the crisp B/W photography and music all work to establish a claustrophobic, dangerous atmosphere....the VHS tape I watched was of surprisingly high quality.  Not quite as engaging or exciting as the first two in the series, but still a more than fitting end to one of the greatest directorial careers in cinema.  Strongly deserving of a quality American DVD release, but in the meantime this VHS is OK if you can get it used or cheap; or, if you have a multiregion DVD player (and why wouldn't you?) you can spring for the Masters of Cinema ""Complete Fritz Lang Mabuse"" set available in the UK.",1258761600,2,2126,4.671122994652406
7898836,4,630590796X,"""The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"" (1960) marked director Fritz Lang's final film. At age 70, Lang returned to Germany after abandoning Hollywood in 1956. Despite a low budget and obvious commercial considerations, Lang managed to create an atmospheric thriller. Though the criminal mastermind had died in 1933's ""The Testament of Dr. Mabuse,"" Lang developed a spiritual heir who would continue the Mabuse tradition. ""1,000 Eyes"" is a throwback to Lang's early German thrillers with a modernist style   depicting a world in which nothing is what it seems. The film has a few slow stretches, but the inventive assassination sequence and climactic car chase represent Lang at his best.",1095379200,4,679,5.220183486238532
7898837,4,630590796X,"This disk is one of my favorites. Although not quite up to the standards of it's two predecessors, the Third Dr. Mabuse film (and the last directed by Lang himself) is wonderful and more than worth the purchase price.
David Kalat's extraordinary commentary is easily THE BEST I have ever heard (and I've heard quite a few.) He strikes the perfect balance between knowledge and wit - the narration is informative without being dry or condescending and, indeed, is quite lively at times. His delivery style is remarkably excellent throughout and is a major reason I consider the disk to be one of my most valued.
Two tiny quibbles, stuff so small as to bother only me: The English Language captioning, written for the German audio track, is a little disorienting when viewed in connection with the English language track. Most of this has to do with the demands of lip-synchronization between two languages. Still, and despite the additional cost it might have created, two independent sets of captions would have been appreciated - one for each of the different languages. This would be a welcome addition for a hearing impared viewer.
The other minor quibble is that the documentary really needed captioning, much more so than the feature owing to the heavy accented speech.
All told, though, this is absolutely a remarkable film and a remarkable, and very treasured disk. AllDay Entertainment is releasing some extraordinary stuff, and deserve kudos and, above all, purchases!",1000339200,16,1477,5.03265306122449
7898838,4,630590796X,"Last movie of german-american director Fritz Lang, 1000 EYES OF DR MABUSE  must not be neglected even if one can prefer M, FURY or MOONFLEET in the  royal filmography of this Master. Personally, I confess that I'm very fond  of this movie, maybe not for the right reasons. 1000 EYES OF DR MABUSE is  one of these movies I've discovered a sunday afternoon on TV when I was  twelve or thirteen years old. And even now, I can remember the nightmares  generated by the blind medium or the multiple hidden rooms of The Luxor  Hotel. To be short, I've bought the DVD right after its release.
As bonus  features, you will have the choice between the subtitled german version or  an english dubbed version, a very interesting commentary of the producer of  the DVD who is a Dr Mabuse specialist (12 Dr Mabuse movies have been  produced until now !). And last but not least, you will discover a  featurette presenting interviews of Fritz Lang's specialists including  Forrest Ackerman.
Naturally, there are a lot of other good reasons to put  this DVD on the shelves of your library but, if you have stopped at this  peculiar page of Amazon, you surely already know that Fritz Lang's 1000  EYES OF DR MABUSE is a valuable addition to any movie lover's collection.  So, have fun with the mad doc.
A DVD for the child in you.",968630400,20,1314,4.547008547008547
7898839,5,630590796X,"The Mabuse films by Fritz Lang are not just ""cop-and-thieves"" thrillers: of course they are quite enjoyable as a thriller-suspence crime movies, but for those with the eyes to see, Mabuse is really a metaphore of  power and its functions in a modern society. Already in 1922, when Lang  made the first Mabuse films (DOCTOR MABUSE in two parts; a new restored DVD  of this film is now in preparation), he foresaw not only the rise of Hitler  and the Nazis, but also a society under control (or hypnosis) by the medias  and informations sirculating on them. Lang's last entry to the series, THE  1000 EYES OF DR.MABUSE, is a nightmarish alegory of the post-war modern  society. The Luxor Hotel where the story mainly takes place is a buiding  made by the Nazis and has a secret camera system ovserving every single  thing that happens in it. The idea that we are all observed by those who  are in power has now, as you see around yourself, became our own reality.  Many contemporary filmmakers, such as Wim Wenders with his END OF THE  VIOLENCE, try to portray the same idea, but none of them are as efficient  as Lang, inspite of the low budget Lang was allowed to spend, and the  classic cliche framework (involving a psychic clairvoyant and an American  millionaire hero). It's a masterpiece, in the sense that it is really an  oeuvre of the master. The new digital transfer from original 35mm elements  is almost flawless and displays Langs lucid vision of the world in a  stunning manner. In the bonus featurettes, people who knew Lang in his last  years talks about him, and is also quite interesting. One problem, though:  the featurette tells us the name of those people but most of them we don't  know who they are. I am also looking forward for the release of THE  TESTAMENT OF DR.MABUSE (the 1932 original) on a DVD that looks as good as  this one.",964915200,20,1857,4.577507598784194
