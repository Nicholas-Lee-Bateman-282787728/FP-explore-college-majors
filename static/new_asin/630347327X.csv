The film grain is kept to a minimum and the restoration process is wonderful. Check out Youtube to see the restoration process.

672947,5,630347327X,"Carol Reed's ""The Third Man,"" with a script by Graham Greene, is a noir thriller set in post-World War II Vienna, which was divided into four zones for each of the Allies at that time. Holly Martins (played by Joseph Cotten) arrives in the city based with a job offer from his friend Harry Lime, who just died the previous day. Martins believes the events surrounding the death suspicious and begins to investigate them, leading him to run afoul of the local military authorities and the criminal underworld.
The story itself is fairly standard for a mystery, but the Viennese setting and the harsh black-and-white's of cinematographer Robert Krasker coupled with Anton Karas's Zither score build an atmosphere all their own that completely draws the viewer into the story. The chase sequence through the elaborate sewers under the city and the scenes in and around the cemetery are perfect uses of blocking and framing to tell a story. Though this film debuted in 1949 and its twists and turns are available online, the film still succeeds in drawing in the audience and surprising them. If you haven't seen this, you must watch it!",1510012800,2,1133,4.875647668393782

I could go into further detail, but why?

All the extras are viewable as well. The subtitles and dubtitles are in English, French, and Dutch for both the film and extras. On blu-ray.com, it says this version is region free. I purchased this from OxfordshireEngland for about $18, via Amazon.com.

As for the film itself, it's one of the best of all time. If you consider yourself a film lover, you owe it to yourself to watch this film. I'm not a technical expert, but the 4K restoration looks and sounds great. Perhaps there's an Ultra High-Definition version down the line, hopefully?

673208,5,630347327X,"In a dark time in America, it reassures me a bit about humanity that so many people understand what a terrific movie this is. Some good reviews below. I'd like to add a couple of points. First, the presence of Orson Welles. Carol Reed was a marvelous director, as you can see in any number of films--try Odd Man Out. But this film is unlike his others in many ways, especially visually. Welles is on the screen, I read, for five minutes. He was present on the set for a week. Yet it's as if Welles's personality as a filmmaker was so powerful that it bent another great director, Carol Reed, in his direction. It's the most Wellesian film I know not directed by Orson Welles. He wrote and improvised a few lines in the immortal Riesenrad scene. But somebody asked Welles if the inspired final scene was his idea and he said, no, he was there that day but that was entirely Reed. Actually it was Reed and David O. Selznick overriding the happy ending that Graham Greene originally wrote. Later Greene admitted that they were absolutely right.

Second, Reed's stunning conception to have the whole score done by a zither player, a middleaged musician named Alex Karas who'd struggled along for years and whom Reed happened to hear in Vienna. Apparently Reed would show Karas scenes and just say, in effect, ""play stuff."" In the process Karas created what became a popular standard, the ""Third Man Theme,"" and got nicely rich. I think it's the most original ""score"" in the history of film, at least until Kubrick's 2001. Some people commenting on the film below were puzzled by it, and I can see why. It took me several viewings to figure out why this music is so apt. (Actually I know Vienna well.) On the surface the music is bubbly and gay, but it's a heavy, fraught gaiety. This music reminds me of an old Viennese saying: ""The situation is desperate, but not serious."" There's an old device in music called counterpoint, in which melodies are superimposed. Karas's zither music is the stunning counterpoint to a very dark story (though not without some  subtle comedy). I don't know of anything else like it.",1489881600,18,2110,4.624

673210,5,630347327X,"The Third Man (1949) is my all-time favorite movie.  This particular release, the 50th Anniversary Edition (1999), is the best version because it was still made from the original 35mm negative, which is now chemically degraded beyond repair.  For a later, computer-enhanced release, the contrast was greatly reduced in an effort to minimize the frame-to-frame changes in density.  In addition, the aspect ratio was changed from 1:33 to 1:25, which squeezed the image horizontally.  I was very lucky to find one of the few remaining DVDs mastered in 1999.",1488931200,6,554,5.191011235955056

673353,5,630347327X,"The Third Man (1949) is a classic film noir that stars Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. Welles' character is Harry Lime, a somewhat subdued criminal with a mysterious presence. Welles doesn't look menacing in this film, but his actions along with the overall darkness of the shots he's in make his character work. This film is known for its darkness and unique camera angles, and of course for its soundtrack, which at first doesn't seem to fit the film. However, as time passes, this lighter music integrates itself neatly into the film as a sort of background soundtrack with an almost cadence and rhythm to it that enhances the movement of the film, which is generally pretty slow. The Third Man works on many levels, and is a great example of film noir. The special features are good as well.

673356,5,630347327X,"A powerful melodrama on the periphery of World War II.  If  CASABLANCA represents the beginning of the war,  THIRD MAN depicts part of the wreckage at its end, with the once-great city of Vienna in ruins and a vicious character named Harry Lime  (Orson Welles)  exploiting the helpless locals.

This movie breaks a lot of cinematic rules to good effect.  No orchestral score, just a single instrument (the zither) playing an eerie melody.  The central character is a bungler for most of the movie.  Lots of the film is in Austrian-German and is not subtitled, so that the non-German-speaking audience (like the main character) spend the early half of the film in the dark as to what is going on.  The big star, Welles, only has about 15 minutes of screen time, though the mystery of his absence dominates the story.  The movie is even a rare case of SUCCESSFUL executive meddling: the producer ordered the famous screenwriter (Graham Greene) to change the ending  ( I won't spoil it here)  and Greene actually ended up agreeing with him.

673567,3,630347327X,"The Third Man, 1949 film

The film begins showing post war Vienna which is divided into four sectors. Holly Martins arrives, he was promised a job (he walks under ladders). Harry Lime isn't there to meet him, he is being buried today. Martins arrives at the graveyard. A stranger offers him a ride and a drink, then pumps him for information. Martins writes cheap novelettes, the westerns that were popular then. Crabbins offers Martins a job to lecture on the contemporary novel; he will be paid. Then Baron Kurtz calls for a meeting; he was a friend of Harry Lime. Martins visits Harrys girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who acts in a classic comedy. She accepts the loss of Harry, and tries to move on with her life. Martins learns more details about Limes death: his driver, his friends, and his doctor were all there. [Was it really an accident?]

Martins and Miss Schmidt return to Limes apartment. The porter tells about Lime: he was quite dead, killed at once. There was a third man present at the death scene! The porter doesnt want to get involved with the police. Next they learn the police are investigating Miss Schmidt, and she is brought in for questioning about her identity papers. Martins visits Dr. Winkel, Limes medical advisor. Miss Schmidt was used to send a message to Joseph Harbin, who went missing the day Lime died. Martins visits the Casanova Club where Harrys friends hung out. Mr. Popescu tells how the death happened. Martins asks about the third man, and tells what the porter saw. Popescu says he doesnt know much more. The porter asks Martins to return that night, but after he closes the window he is startled as if he saw a ghost. Martins tells Anna about Harry, how he could fix things and knew how to fiddle the rules. When they go to visit the porter they find he was murdered. Did he know too much?

Holly Martins speaks to the literary club. He seems to be over his head among the literary crowd. Two hard looking men pursue him, but he flees through dark alleys to escape. Major Calloway explains the racket that Lime organized. Stolen penicillin was watered down and sold for enormous profits. The facts convince Martins. Before he leaves he visits Anna Schmidt to say goodbye. On his way home Martins is startled to see a watcher in a doorway. He reports this to Calloway, who investigates and discovers buried facts. Martins goes to meet Harry Lime to warn him of what the police know. The conversation reveals Limes amorality, and Limes ignorance of history. Martins makes a deal to save Anna, but she doesnt want to be saved [symbolism?]. Martins is convinced to help Calloway by meeting Lime while the police keep watch. The trap works, Lime flees underground among the rats while the authorities pursue. A special force searches the sewer system. There is a dramatic ending to the chase that echoes He Walked By Night. Martins settles his debts with his old friend. [Lime had picked him for the patsy.] The film ends with another funeral, not a Hollywood ending. [This fast-paced film entertains without drawing attention to the improbable events.]

Switzerland is famous for its militia system that prevents any military takeover and guarantees its democracy. In olden days they also hired out to foreign monarchs who wanted a reliable armed guard. Cuckoo clocks represent a high value export for its day, like watches today. Limes slur on Switzerland is wrong.",1473724800,,3402,4.770797962648557

As you start watching, you feel compelled to force yourself to try to agree with those ratings, but as the movie goes on, and you fail not to compare it with a large list of better movies - with much better plot and acting, you start to realize that the rating probably came from people who were more successful in ignoring and accepting the simplicity of those times.

I enjoyed the movie, however - very much, and I struggled not to give it 4 stars. Although the plot is simple and the acting is forced, the cinematography is amongst the best there is; deserving to make it to the top of all times. Also, this movie contains a scene that, in a very heartless yet logical fashion, explains how people hurt hundreds or thousands can then live with themselves at peace; this is the only scene of the movie I remembered from watching it last time over 35 years ago.",1468022400,,1027,4.348958333333333

The change in packaging is understandable (given this release was back in 2010), but I am disappointed in the missing booklet.

meets his girlfriend who is a Russian who wants to find Welles but doesn't want Cotton to turn him over to the Police after he's involved
in a drug scam that has killed many people. The chase scene is one of the best ever in movie history and the ending with Cotton and

In this case the novel is very good.  The author is Graham Greene and if you enjoy novels, you may find it well worth your effort to become familiar with the works of this exceptional author.  Normally I would expect to find this novel to be better than the movie.  But this was not the case.

This has to be one of the finest movies ever made.  It is a true work of art.  I personally love film noir and this is a supreme example of this art form.  The cast is outstanding.  The acting is superb.  Having read the novel and having viewed the movie, I can tell you there is a famous addition to the movie dialogue referring to ""cuckoo clocks"".  In case you have not seen the movie, I am being intentionally vague.  According to my studies this change was made by Orson Welles himself.  I feel it adds much to the script.

I'm not gonna summarize the movie because if you're thinking of buying this then you probably have already seen it and are just looking for a high-quality-picture/sound version for your DVD/Blu-Ray collection.  The good news is that this looks and sounds quite good.  I heard that the Criterion version is a better transfer, and obviously that one has lots of exclusive supplements, but that is out of print and will cost you a couple hundred nowadays.  This version is a worthy runner-up.

The transfer is pretty much fantastic.  Picture is crisp and clean, and it does the beautiful black & white cinematography justice.

Soundtrack is pretty good too.  I mean it was all mono back then, so you shouldn't expect to get a blockbuster surround audio experience, but the mix is pretty solid.  Favors the music over dialogue, but the music is half the joy of this movie, so that's hardly a problem.  Still, you might want to raise your volume a little extra to compensate.

674486,5,630347327X,"Most people consider Citizen Kane to be Orson Welles' best film, but as far as I'm concerned that honor goes to The Third Man, a post-WW II movie set in Vienna. Cotton and Welles are both exceptional, and Trevor Howard delivers a great cameo performance as Major Calloway, a British army policeman. The movie has odd camera angles, looming shadows that portend the abyss, a post-war dreariness that somehow gives sparkling life to  every scene, a moral dimension that grabs hold of you and just won't let go.
The scene on the Ferris Wheel, when Welles compares the barely visible people below, to moving dots and asks Cotton how many dots would he eliminate for a certain sum of money, has stuck in my head for decades. How much is a life worth? Back on the ground, Welles attempts to justify his philosophy with, ""You know what the fellow said  in Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace  and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""

Because the story starts quickly, there is exactly zero character development. Within 20 minutes, I simply did not care what was going to happen.

The story follows an American pulp-western author, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) as he travels to live in Austria with his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) after being offered a job by him. Almost as soon as he arrives he discovers he had been killed after being struck by a car. The police believe that Lime was scum who deserved to die, but Martins is determined to find out who killed Lime and why.

Striking themes of friendship, mercy, justice are chewed up with fangs that would be pulled from a lot of films today.  The whole package is gutsy, from that seemingly misused soundtrack to the haunting images of post-war Vienna, to the way it scoffs at American idealism.

675264,5,630347327X,"Every so often a movie comes along where everything works -- cast, script, director, subject, location, and music.  ""The Third Man"" is just such a happy accident.  To me, what gives the movie its special resonance is the location.  It was filmed in post-war Vienna, amid empty streets, baroque buildings, and bombing rubble, which take on the look of a nightmare thanks to off-angle camera shots and wide-angle lens distortions.

 Driving the story is the mysterious death of Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles who seems to lurk behind every scene despite being off-camera until the third act. The protagonist is Joseph Cotton as naive everyman Holly Rollins, who is drawn into the story by the death of his best friend.  The love interest is played by Alida Valli, at her Ingrid Bergman best, as Anna.

 When at last they meet, real-life pals Welles and Cotton take movie history's most memorable Ferris wheels ride at Vienna's famed amusement park, the Prater.  After threatening to throw Cotton off the wheel, Welles smilingly notes that Italy under the tyrant Borgias generated centuries of art and progress, while Switzerland's peaceful democratic government produced ""the cuckoo clock.""  Welles himself wrote the speech as a means of justifying his character's lucrative (and fatal) medical fraud on Vienna's unsuspecting public.

 The movie concludes with a dramatic chase in the labyrinth sewer system beneath the city.  Rounding out the movie's perfection is the soundtrack, performed by Anton Karas (discovered in a Vienna beer hall) on the zither.  Known as ""The Harry Lime Theme"" it became a major hit record in 1951.  Shot in glorious back-and-white, ""The Third Man"" is film noir at its best.  Five stars.",1406419200,4,1718,5.103942652329749

It takes place in post WWII Vienna and the destruction, the mutlipower occupation are worth seeing for the reminder of how things were back then. It is worth watching with a surprise or two, and the scenes of wartime or post war time Europe. Joseph Cotton plays the role of a writer of second rate (at best) novelist who is invited there by Harry, arrives to find him dead, and then is sucked into intrigue and danger by events surrounding Harry's death, and the disappearance of another. Cotton develops an interest in a woman who is Harry's love interest. She is traveling under false papers, well forged, but becomes an interest of the Russians because of a disappeared czech partisan. Worth watching for many reasons. One film critic called it one of the top 100 films of all time.

675525,5,630347327X,"I was five when this movie was released, but I had never seen it up to now. I do remember the BBC series with Michael Rennie as Harry Lime, which also had lots of zither music. The original is very good, though. The picture quality of the Blu-Ray version was fine, and the black-and-white cinematography absolutely apt for this story, set in bombed-out Vienna after WW2. Carol Reed's tilted camera angles, and his frequent use of shots from high above, and of shadows rather than subjects all contribute to the sense of disorientation experienced by the protagonist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a writer of pulp western thrillers who has come to Vienna because his childhood friend Harry Lime has said he has a job for him. He gets there only to find that Lime is dead -- he is just in time to attend the funeral -- and then to be discomposed by the fact that he can't get a straight story from people who claim to have been eyewitnesses. This offends Martins' narrative sense, and so he sets out to find ""the truth."" The truth is ugly, but Martins can handle it. One part of the truth, of course, is that Lime isn't dead, and Martins learns of his cynical and corrupt doings from British authorities, in the person of Major Callaway (Trevor Howard), with whom Martins, after a rocky start, forms a kind of alliance. Martins is also fascinated by Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), Lime's lover, and the extent of her knowledge of Lime's corruption is troubling to Martins, who is drawn to her.

The big set piece of the movie is a climactic chase through the sewers of Vienna, a tense and marvelously filmed sequence, but I was drawn more to the restraint of the movie. Harry Lime -- played by Orson Welles -- isn't on screen much at all (and not at all until quite late in the film) but he conveys the character's cynicism, corruption, and dangerousness with force and economy. And the scene in the hospital in which Martins is shown evidence of the extent of Lime's corruption actually shows US (the viewers) almost nothing, but Cotten and Howard nonetheless convey all that needs to be conveyed. There is some humor too: what looks like a car-chase scene turns out not to be quite what it seems -- and yet a sense of menace is communicated that fits in with the overall tone. So . . . really good. I love that black-and-white!",1393286400,,2326,4.551312649164678

The default version is the U.K. version. However, you can see the different versions compared on the DVD extras. Speaking about extras, one of the best extra is that of the abbreviated play being read voice-over the film. I defiantly ordered the book.

This film is presented in black and white. You can see how tight the presentation is without a wasted word or glance. The Music is also one of the main characters of the film. I only remember the Blu-ray version so I cannot tell the quality of the other versions.

Even though the book looks from the view of Major Calloway (Trevor Howard in the film) and the film from the view of Holly Martins, it is the character of Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee) that we find endearing.

Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) an out of work novelist (Westerns) is offered a job in post war Vienna by his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Holly arrives he finds he is late for Harry's funeral. The authorities are besmirching Harry's memory. Harry's girl (Alida Valli) after hearing of a mysterious third man at Harry's car accident suggested that Harry's death may not have been an accident.

As usual, Criterion has done a magnificent job not only with supplemental material on the disc but with the printed booklet accompanying the product.  Both the Blu-ray and DVD of this film were taken out of print and for a long time I agonized over whether or not to purchase the Blu-ray or be content with the DVD.  I finally decided that I couldn't live without it.  It just didn't seem that my film library would be complete without it.

The film itself, as most cinephiles will attest, is generally considered to be one of the finest examples of its kind ever made.  Brilliant direction by Carol Reed along with great performances by Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli make this a must-have for lovers of the genre.  So many great moments punctuate this gem and can be commented on but I will say that, personally, my favorite scene is between Welles and Cotton which takes place high above Vienna on the ""Prater"" wheel.

The title, as you will come to realize, refers to Welles as Harry Lime, the mysterious and thoroughly corrupt character at the story's center, and even though he appears in only three scenes, Welles steals the movie. Joseph Cotton plays Holly Martins, a writer of detective novels and friend of Lime's. When Martins travels to Vienna at Lime's invitation and promise of a moneymaking opportunity, he learns upon arrival that Lime has been killed in a traffic accident. That knowledge, and the discovery that many of the city's residents are desperate and therefore dangerous, should alert Martins to leave immediately. Instead, he finds himself falling for Harry's lover, Anna (Alida Valli), and quickly getting himself drawn farther and farther into the intrigues surrounding his former friend. From the very beginning, though, nothing is what it seems, and by the time the movie is over, you still won't be sure what has been going on - but chances are you won't mind the experience one bit. You will rarely encounter snappier movie dialogue, and the scenes of post-World War II Vienna are fascinating, particularly the climactic chase, which takes place (mostly) down in the city's sewer system. The movie's music and title theme are distinctive and famous, played by Anton Karas on an instrument called a zither.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1380758400,,1718,5.876

675980,4,630347327X,"The Third Man is the exciting and suspenseful European response to film noir, a genre often associated with America. Its visuals and narrative follow what we have come to expect from your typical noir, but its thematic content and musical score are distinctly European.

We follow our hero, an American, through a (supposed) murder mystery of his former friend in the heart of Vienna. This is a bleak vision of Vienna, physically and emotionally destroyed from World War II and still recovering. Four powers hold jurisdiction over this territory, and everyone is always stepping on someone else's toes.

The European theme is further strengthened through, interestingly enough, its American protagonist; he is a picture of American exceptionalism gone too far, interfering with others' affairs despite their constant warnings for him to stay away.

This is a surprisingly efficient film, packing in a lot of plot for just a 100-minute run time. The fast pacing keeps us engaged and fully immersed in the action taking place. Surprises and big reveals work effectively, as we know only as much as our hero (again, back to typical noir).

675982,5,630347327X,"Just remember these two things from this review above all else:

#1) The Third Man is a classic that is still cool even today, not one of those classics that has lost most relevance with time.

#2) The Criterion Collection is awesome and is the ultimate gift series for cinephiles. It is well worth the extra money to buy the Criterion version of a movie if you are a film nut.

Who was the third man?

Just like other questions posed in this movie, it may yield to some answer, but that answer is unsatisfactory and leads to yet another mystery or question. Novelist Graham Green's screenplay craftily offers many more questions than answers; those questions in the microcosm (questions on the human level related to trust, friendship, and moral ambiguity) spiral outward and outward to the big, macrocosm question that Carol Reed's beautiful and stilted camerawork of a ruined post-war Vienna slaps you with at every frame. How did one of the prime civic symbols of culture, intelligence, and sophistication that was Vienna come to be allied with one of the worst and most boorish regimes in history, Nazi Germany? And because they have now suffered Germany's same fate, much of the wonder and glory of Vienna is lying in big piles of rubble that the Viennese must now stumble through in the Hellscape that is their new home.

Reed's superb camerawork and beautiful, dark cinematography present a Vienna that is off-tilt, a setting that has lost its axis and orientation. When coupled with a truly unique zither score, the combination of these elements give the viewer very unsettling and disturbing feelings, haunting you with questions as you try to figure out what has happened and why. What are the roots of the ruin and corruption that poor Vienna has suffered? Do buildings, monuments, and opera houses gradually decay with time? Sure, but they don't suddenly explode all over the place gradually with time. Who can be the cause of that ruin and corruption? You will do well to see Reed's painstakingly presented horror of Vienna as a reflection of the horror and corruption within the people who inhabit it, including the cast of characters in this film noir par excellence.

I will not say much about the movie's plot except that it starts with a writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cottens) being summoned to Vienna by his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles) because Lime has offered Holly a job. The only problem is that when Holly gets there, he can't find Harry Lime. But that won't be the biggest problem Holly Martins encounters when trying to find his old friend.

As far as cinema goes, Orson Welles gives one of the best performances as a villain ever with Harry Lime. Welles has very little screen time, but when he is on screen, you aren't aware of anything else; you are transfixed to Welles. He created a character with as big a presence as Welles himself had, and that guy was BIG! His casual, off-handed, and indirect evil done with no concern or empathy for others is a remarkably modern interpretation of our au currant devils (one could think of CEOs of businesses, especially CEOs of drug companies). He is truly chilling. Once you see the scene on the Ferris wheel, you will have a hard time forgetting it.

The only other villains I've seen that have comparatively little screen time but have dominated their scenes and fascinated viewers with their incredible charisma are the following: Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's Joker. Lime is right up there and belongs in the upmost echelon of evil.

Is indifference its own kind of evil? Is it the worst kind of evil? Perhaps not, but it may be the most recalcitrant form of evil to combat. Because unlike armies and enemy countries, you cannot bomb indifference into oblivion. There may be no way to vanquish it.",1372896000,4,3811,4.788432267884323

676066,5,630347327X,"My favorite film, and one of the finest ever made. Carol Reed's noir classic makes use of a great lead performance by Welles' frequent collaborator Joseph Cotton, signature odd camera angles chosen by its director, Anton Karas' incredible Zither soundtrack, and a script written by Graham Greene that answers few questions the film presents. What's really wonderful though are the few scenes featuring Orson as the unforgettable Harry Lime, a performance that proves how much of a presence the actor truly had during his lifetime.
Whether you're after the DVD or the Blu-Ray version of this noir masterpiece, you should shell out the extra money for the Criterion Collection version, if anything because the print used in these editions is the best one available. The  Criterion print looks and sounds the best it possibly could for this film. This transfer really shows off the lush cinematography and the amazing soundtrack for the film.

The cast is just brilliant, contrasting Joseph Cotten's brilliant Holly Martens with Trevor Howard's cynical officer, and Orson Welles' memorable cameo as Harry Lime.  The locations are equally memorable, redolent of a post-war era when Vienna was trying to pick itself up after years of bombing, yet prevented from doing so by the prevalence of black-marketeers such as Lime.  The sequence taking place by the ferris-wheel is just brilliant: Robert Krasker's atmospheric black-and-white photography creating a nightmare world in which everything - even simple pleasures such as riding on the wheel - is ripe for exploitation.

676178,5,630347327X,"I owned the Criterion DVD of this classic film. I have not seen their BD version, which is now oop and commands top dollar from third-party sellers.

This Studio Canal issue is the only reasonably priced BD out there right now, and it really is quite good. Other amazon reviewers have complained about the print quality, but I have to disagree. This is a clean and clear print that does justice to the film. I'll admit that facial images are less sharp in extreme close-ups, but I don't know if that effect wasn't intended by director Carol Reed.

I was quite pleased with the soundtrack as well - it is super clean. The dialogue comes out nicely, and the musical soundtrack is very well balanced, which is to say that the zither music isn't too loud and nearing distortion levels as it often seems to when broadcast on TV. There's more sweetness to the zither's tone in this version - I like it.

The extras are enjoyable, especially the visual tour of Vienna which takes us to many of the landmarks and neighborhoods that served as locations for the film. Each stop on the tour starts with a still photo from the 1948 film, followed by a 2010 shot of the exact same location, followed by an informative and interesting background video that tells us a little about what happened at the location during the shooting of the film.

The only problem I found with this product is that the cardboard O-ring that surrounds the BD shell is really tight around the plastic box, making it a bit of work to dislodge the BD case from the O-ring. Of course, you can always toss the O-ring as all the info contained on it also appears in the BD shell itself.

676183,5,630347327X,"Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears. Perhaps Welles was defining in this bit of philosophy his own status as Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN.

It's difficult to think of Harry as a star role, for the man is an unmitigated and unrepentant scoundrel who sold diluted penicillin to hospitals-- tampered-with medicine that caused the death or permanent disabling of dozens of children and adults. Even as Harry looks down from the height of a Ferris wheel at ant-sized people he expresses to friend Holly Martins (Cotten) his disdain and unconcern for humanity. Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the ""star"" of this Carol Reed picture? No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.

Original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war-scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding. Kudos to Alida Valli as a Czech refugee actress who fears deportation by the Russians. Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with. Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business-like military demeanor and well-masked concern. Minor characters like a so-called 'Baron' and other shady types keep Holly and us always on our toes.

This noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status. Highly recommended to all!

From above, you hear the wind whistling through the empty street, representing a freedom that Lime will never have.

676321,5,630347327X,"As is typical of the company's releases, Criterion's version of The Third Man is definitive. It's a beautiful restoration of both image and sound, supplemented by a wealth of interesting material about the making of the film. (Just hearing the original film treatment read by a fine actor, for example, makes you realize again what a great storyteller Graham Greene was in prose, quite apart from the masterpiece of a script he crafted for this film.)

And what a film it is! It's perfectly paced by director Carol Reed, memorably acted by Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard and many others (with wonderful layers of tension, humor and romance), and stunningly photographed -- mostly at night -- by cinematographer Robert Krasker (for which he won a richly-deserved Oscar). Even the theme music, composed and performed on the zither by Anton Karas, was a huge hit in both the UK and the US. Surely one of the great film noirs of all time, The Third Man was also voted the best British film of the 20th Century by the British Film Institute.

If you love movies, you'll love this film.

Criterion brought out their version in Blu-ray in 2008. This version is now legendary. The original film was shot by three crews working simultaneously, with two handling the night exteriors and interior sets while another shot the few daytime exteriors. Reed apparently didn't supervise the daytime unit as closely as the others, and, with one or two notable exceptions (the famous ending, for example), those sequences aren't as memorable as the night exteriors and the interior sets. Thus, they don't seem to be especially improved by either Criterion's restoration or the Blu-ray technology.

But the night and interior shots! Wow! Everyone who knows the movie talks about the ""wet streets"" where much of the action takes place. In the Criterion Blu-ray version, we see these streets in a wholly new way. They have a beautiful sparkle and luminosity that shades into the deep nighttime blackness of the buildings and the atmosphere. Surely this is what Reed and Krasner actually saw and wanted us to see. Close-ups of the actors reveal subtle changes in the eyes and in facial expressions that are much more veiled in the DVD (not to mention VHS) formats. The range of grays -- between the film's deep, unlit blacks and it spotlit whites, is far richer and more nuanced in this version. The set designs are more detailed to the eye; the actors' wardrobes easier to study.  So this is not only a very fun version for fans of the film. It's also by far the best version for people who enjoy the building blocks of movies -- the cinematography, the lighting, the art direction.

Those are big advantages, in my opinion.

Now for the bad news. The Blu-ray edition went out of print not long after it was released. Due to some apparently undisclosed issues over the future rights to the film, it looks unlikely to ever be released again. (Now and then I've contacted Criterion about it, but they're not saying much.) Therefore this edition has become breathtakingly expensive in the aftermarket. I looked at it a year ago and it was selling for $100. This year it seems to be up to $200. I considered myself lucky to get a new, unopened one for $150.

I don't regret it for a moment, but then again, I've loved this movie for years and I had a pretty good idea what a step up the Criterion Blu-ray would be. It's totally met my expectations. Then again, I can't imagine another movie I'd spend $150 on.

The rival Studio-Canal Blu-ray version of the film is pretty good, and may well be fine for all but zealots like me. The regular Criterion DVD version of the film, though also out of print, is much less expensive in the aftermarket, and it includes the extras, which are terrific.

So if you've ""gotta, gotta"" have the undisputed best version of The Third Man, in all likelihood this is it. But it's going to cost you. If, on the other hand, just enjoying this great movie is reward enough, consider some of the other versions on the market.",1358640000,12,4038,4.698727015558699

.
Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears. Perhaps Welles was defining in this bit of philosophy his own status as Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN.

It's difficult to think of Harry as a star role, for the man is an unmitigated and unrepentant scoundrel who sold diluted penicillin to hospitals-- tampered-with medicine that caused the death or permanent disabling of dozens of children and adults. Even as Harry looks down from the height of a Ferris wheel at ant-sized people he expresses to friend Holly Martins (Cotten) his disdain and unconcern for humanity. Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the ""star"" of this Carol Reed picture? No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.

Original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war-scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding. Kudos to Alida Valli as a Czech refugee actress who fears deportation by the Russians. Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with. Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business-like military demeanor and well-masked concern. Minor characters like a so-called 'Baron' and other shady types keep Holly and us always on our toes.

This noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status. Highly recommended to all!

It's amazing how it can change to enhance and intensify the mood or action--or comment on it from an ironic distance. It's interesting how Reed chose when and how to use this music in various ways, or not use it.

The final scene is poetic. I'd like to know what other movie scenes can compare to its lyricism--there may be some, can't think of one right now. Any suggestions?

It is enhanced by the poignant music, expressing regret at longing. The scene is beautiful with the long lines of trees, as she walks down from afar. as he waits motionless,  and she passes him by without a look, as the leaves fall--and he is left standing there, looking after her, lighting a smoke....ah, sublime.

676606,5,630347327X,"The Third Man is one of the most beautifully photographed films of all time. This achievement is director Carol Reed's, and his alone. The dominating force behind the film is Harry Lime, a name heard countless times before we are given a face to go along with it, this achievement is belongs to Graham Greene and Orson Welles. The trust between celluloid and the audience comes from the film's hero, Holly Martins. This achievement belongs to Joseph Cotten. But its the atmosphere that is the most endearing aspect of this classic 1949 treasure of a movie. This is film presents an engrossing experience from start to finish, and absolutely everything about it is pitch perfect. From Vienna at midnight to Trevor Howard's often dismissed, but completely wonderful performance as Major Calloway (Not Callahan, He's British, Not Irish). Orson Welles delivers one of the best performances of all time, due partly to the scene atop a Ferris Wheel, and mostly to his absence, and the care taken by writer Graham Greene in creating a perfect character without ever actually seeing him. Joseph Cotten is superb, hasn't been this good since his lead role in Shadow Of A Doubt or his strong support in Citizen Kane. He makes Holly Martins down to earth, brave, headstrong, and truly American. Alida Valli is breathtaking, and because of her, Anna Schmidt is a character we take joy in watching, making Anna Schmidt one of the greater love interest in the Film Noir genre. The photography is incredible, the city enormous and isolating, the characters are canon, the story is timeless, and the film is perfect. The only hands down and flat out perfect film of the 1940s. A true treasure. A real gift.

And Criterion, as to be expected, have outdone themselves again. The Criterion Blu Ray Edition is now a Collector's Item, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the DVD transfer.

I know you can't go wrong with Criterion, except Amazon charges $140 for a new Criterion version of this film but only around $22 for the Blu-Ray.
So I went for the Blu-Ray, but, as John Arbuckle used to say, ""You get what you pay for.""
My main problem with the Blu-Ray edition is the sound. It gets louder. Then it gets softer. I found myself with the remote in hand during the entire film so I could continually adjust, and then readjust, the volume, not exactly the best way to enjoy a work of art.
One major continuing beef I have with Amazon is that, unless I'm missing something, when you read customer reviews of a film that's available in more than one edition, Amazon doesn't distinguish between the versions that the reviewers are writing about.
So when you read reviews of a film that is out in multiple editions, you don't know which edition the reviewer is referring to unless he or she happens to expressly mention it.
If you are reading this review of mine, I imagine you know that it concerns the Blu-Ray version of ""The Third Man,"" not the Criterion edition.
In the past, I've had positive experiences purchasing new and used items from other sellers who advertise on Amazon so, my advice is, if you are thinking about purchasing this film, buy a used criterion edition for approximately the same price that Amazon charges for the new Blu-Ray. I have yet to go wrong with Criterion.
I also have to add that I'm offended by Amazon's $140 price tag for a new Criterion edition. I regard that as highway robbery unless the disk is  delivered in person by Alida Valli.",1341100800,4,1692,4.565789473684211

The mob is so irrational that even a child can incite them. Some people even pay with their lives pursueing good idealistic goals even in a balanced way. It is about people with missplaced loyalties. Some people overcome it and some people do not. And some people who get out of the trap almost fall right back in. It is only fate that protects them. But people who lose their good idealistic goals can end in a horrible fate. Balance is difficult to achieve. War only makes this tendancy worse. My only complaint about this movie is that there were very few examples of people with a good balanced view; perhaps Major Calloway and Sergeant Paine. Just as the Zither music started to get out of control, it starts to fade into the background. It was really only too much at the beginning.

676706,4,630347327X,"Graham Greene wrote the book, but I admit I've never read it. Seems amazing that this is my first encounter with so famous a movie and/or book. Anyway, I recognized the theme music.

Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna just in time to catch the funeral of his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Lime's girlfriend Anna (an actress named Vallei) is at the funeral, and Martins ends up involved with her life for a variety of reasons, among them the fact that her passport (she's Czech) was forged by Lime. Since Vienna is ruled by a four-nation coalition of Americans, British, French and Russians, the Russians want to repatriate her, treating her as a member of the Soviet Union.

But there's more. Martins soon begins to suspect that Lime's death was not an accident, especially since different witnesses give different accounts of what happened the night he was killed. The title ""The Third Man"" relates to the fact that one witness said there were three men who carried him to the sidewalk after being hit by a truck, whereas the other witnesses say there were two.

Next, he discovers that the police are searching for an associate of Lime's that disappeared a couple of weeks earlier, and everyone keeps telling Martins to go back to the states and not get involved. Involved in what? He's just trying to find out how his friend died. But the more he probes, the more he discovers that there's a lot more here than a simple accident, or even a murder.

Nothing is what it seems at first in this movie. Nothing, really nothing. Good guys, bad guys, motives, even real facts. There's very little I can add without telling you too much. I think you will find the ending unexpected no matter how closely you pay attention. But that's fine; it's worth seeing twice to catch what you missed.",1336867200,4,1801,4.6719242902208205

The location is post-war Vienna, dark, seedy, watched over by four different countries who do not get along entirely well. There are bombed-out ruins in all directions. The black market thrives and the locals are nervous about the occupiers. Into this complicated mix of cultures and emotions comes Holly, an American writer of cowboy stories. He's upset when he finds his friend Harry has just died, and outraged when the police and others indicate that Harry was a racketeer. He is convinced that there's a conspiracy to blacken his friend's name, and he's going to get to the bottom of it.

He's soon chasing down the doctor who Harry went to, other friends of Harry's, as well as Anna, Harry's girlfriend. Holly begins to fall for Anna, and assembling together the threads of a story. But things are even more complicated than they appear.

The characters are great, and the cinematography is brilliant. The shadows hide and reveal characters, Motives slide and slip. The movie gets better with subsequent watchings, as you sense the hidden motives and see the subtle touches, the hiding of the photo, the playing with the dice. The children pushing the carousel because they can't afford tickets.

A classic scene involves characters high in a ferris wheel, talking about the people below as ""dots"" - about whether anyone really cares about those tiny dots. Does anyone really care whether they live or die? It's a powerful view of the world, and an insight into the way the characters view the world. I love the discussion about how the quiet Swiss culture produced cuckoo clocks, while the violence-laden Italian culture of the Renaissance created fantastic artwork.

While several AFI top 100 movies are good to watch just once for historical purposes, this one is well worth owning and rewatching several times.",1328918400,2,1982,4.869436201780416

Everything comes together with a style and substance that is simply remarkably enjoyable!  The sets and locations make post-war Vienna as much a character as any of the actors.  Joseph Cotton shines as the naive Holly Martin.

But the stage is entirely stolen by Orson Welles.  From the moment you first see his feet, to the last you see his fingertips, Welles dominates this film.

You won't be the first. On that note this is one of the Noir classics. It's won a ton of awards, including AFI's Top 100 and Britain's Academy Awards for Best Film. Tale focuses on an author of Westerns who comes to Vienna because his friend, Harry Lime, offered him a job. However, when he arrives he finds out that Harry Lime was killed in a car accident yet when he investigates it he finds contradictory facts being tossed out to him. That's where the title comes into play. Look for the extreme close ups and strangely placed camera angles. The American writer's optimism and sometimes blind loyalty to his friend contrasts vividly at times with the cynical Post War gloominess of Vienna. In Austria, ""local critics were underwhelmed"" and the film ran for only a few weeks; William Cook, after his 2006 visit to an eight-room museum in Vienna dedicated to the film, wrote ""In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past."" The musical score is strangely alluring.

676849,3,630347327X,"Carol Reed's famous and frankly, hideously over-rated, classic from 1949 stars Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, an American two bit Western novelist, who has gone to war torn Vienna to find his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) as he has offered him the chance of some work. Unfortunately, Martins finds out that Lime has been killed in a hit and run. Through asking around and the inquires of the British occupying forces' Military Police, Martins finds out more than he wishes to, about his dead friend.

There's much to like about 'The Third Man', but for the life of me, I'm at a loss to understand why it's considered so highly as it is. There's not an awful lot going on in it, to be honest. It's depiction of post-war Vienna is quite well done, but because it was shot in Vienna in 1948, that wouldn't be very hard, would it? The cast is well formed and everyone does their best, but the story isn't that engaging. The ""twist"" is seen from a mile off, even for contemporary audiences and once that reveal is delivered, the picture sort of drones on.

Speaking of ""droning on"", the much celebrated music that accompanies the film VERY QUICKLY gets terribly irritating. Produced on a zither only, it has great touches in certain places, but intrudes awfully in others.

On the plus side, it's quite well shot and directed with a realistic touch that sets it aside from a lot of films from that period and although the rumor that Welles had more to do with the direction than Reed did is false, Reed was certainly a ""student"" of Welles's technique. There is also some great dialogue in the film, including the ""cookoo clock"" monologue and Trevor Howard has some great ""irritated"" moments concerning his sir name, ""It's Calloway (not Callahan)...I'm English, not Irish.""

Often hailed as a ""Masterpiece"" of cinema, I must confess, I am often left wondering why.",1317859200,7,1866,4.697247706422019
676962,5,630347327X,"This film will undoubtedly be ranked as among the great films of the 20th century.  It's all been said before so I won't get into writing a review of the film itself.  However, there is one point I wish to bring up.  I bought the Criterion DVD  which for picture and sound has all anyone could wish.  However, like all non-anamorphically processed DVDs containing a non-widescreen movie, it  has the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which is, of course, the standard for NTSC television since 1941.  However, many people don't realize that the standard set in 1931 for motion pictures was 1.37:1 and remained so until 1953 when a wider aspect ratio was introduced, varying from 1.66:1 to 1.85:1, optional with the directors and/or producers.  As a result all DVDs containing movies from the 30s, 40s and early 50s have been processed at 1.33:1 to conform to the prevailing television standard.

Now with HD television and Blu-ray discs, the 1.33:1 standard is no longer an issue.  All pre 1953 movies released on Blu-ray can be and one hopes will be presented in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  I was happy to see that Warner Bros. released the Blu-ray version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" using the 1.37:1 standard even though the packaging states it as 1.33:1.  The difference is small but it's definitely there.  Here's hoping it will be maintained by all providers of Blu-ray titles.",1315180800,4,1365,4.782051282051282
676963,5,630347327X,"Voted the best British film of the 20th century, and regarded as the best film ever filmed in Vienna, The Third Man was the first of its kind in many ways: filmed in 1949, it was the first British film shot largely on location, it was also the first to focus on a single musician rather than an orchestra for its soundtrack.

This Criterion Collection DVD is loaded with stuff. The first DVD comes with the full movie, plus three additional audio tracks: commmentary by Stephen Soderbergh and screennwriter Tony Gilroy, commentary by film scholar Dana Polan, and an abridged recording of Graham Greene's treatment of the story, to follow the whole film, as ready by actor Richard Clarke. There is also a video introduction by director Peter Bogdanovich. The second DVD has three documentaries, two radio plays based on The Third Man, photo data, the two alternate opening narrations, and a bunch of other stuff.

Bogdanovich, in his intro, calls it the best ""non-auteur"" film ever made. Carol Reed is underrated, probably because his last films weren't so fantastic. Great black and white photography, the real star of the film, showing the wetness of the stones. Orson Welles had told Bogdanovich ""Black and white is the actor's friend. Every performance is better in black and white. Name me one great performance in colour, I defy you."" Peter Bogrdanovich agrees, as there is a lack of distraction by familiar colour themes, and the focus is on the drama instead. Orson Welles says it's the greatest ""star part"", in the way that he doesn't step onstage until late into the movie. Welles says he had no influence on the film, he only wrote the cuckoo clock speech. The film is called daring and fast cutting, and Bogdanovich recommends the In Search of the Third Man book. The documentary notes that Guy Hamilton, an assistant director on this film, went on to direct three Bond films, including ""Goldfinger,"" and explains how Graham Greene went to Vienna for a few weeks, arriving on February 11th, 1948; on the last day he heard from the British intelligence about the penicillin scam, which gave him his idea for the plot. The UK intro to the film was narrated by Carol Reed himself ,the US intro by Joseph Cotton. ""Oh, I want to tell you about Holly Martens."" Walks under a ladder (why is it there? it's a prop, he's been scripted to walk under a ladder... it's foreshadowing!), talks to an old Austrian porter (famed Austrian actor Paul Horbiger, actually), who tells him that Harry Lime, the man he is looking for, is dead and either in Hell (he points up) or Heaven (he points down). This is a mixup of language, but it also shows how upside-down everything was in 1949.

There is some great German dialogue by the famed Austrian actress Hedwig Bleibtreu: ""Die Befreiung habe ich mich ganz anders vorgestellt."" (I had imagined that the Liberation would be much different than this.) ""Oh, danke, Sie sind wirklich das eingzige anstndige Mensch hier."" (Oh, thank you, you are really the only decent person here.) Crooked frames in some shots describe the chaos, sprial staircases hint at madness. Holly is bitten by a cockatiel, then there is the chase through the streets of Vienna. ""You were born to be murdered"" Callahan says to Holly. Extra content - director Reed and producer David Selznik had disagreed over Welles, who was Reed's choice but who Selznik considered box office poison. There were three units - day, night, and sewer, and the on-site production continued over seven weeks. Director Carol Reed chewed benzedrine in order to be able to direct all three units, nearly 24 hours a day. Reed cut a Vienna at night series, but couldn't use it because he believed that every shot must be functional (where is it? why isn't it in the Criterion Collection version of the film?!?!). Since Welles came late, many shots were done with stand-ins; and since he was appalled at the filth of the sewer, a sound stage was built at Shepperton Studios to recreate parts of the sewer system. Austrian actors were flown in for this too. In the studio at the same time were Cary Grant, Montgomery Clift and Ann Sheridan. Viennese musician of note Anton Karas played at the welcome reception for the film actors when they came to shoot on location, Carol Reed was taken by the instrument he played at the recdption, the hitherto-unknown (to him, and to British and American actors and directors) zither, and recorded hours of his music in his hotel room. When it was decided to use the music in the intro, it was unprecedented because film scores were always orchestral and didn't focus on solo instruments.

There is archival material, such as the press pack, and the original trailers: (man's hard voice) ""Hated by 1,000 men"", (woman's desirous voice) ""desired by one woman."" (man's voice) ""The Third Man - hanging's too good for him""; (woman's voice, desirous) ""Nothing's too good for The Third Man"". Crazy titles like ""He'll have you in a dither with his zither"" (ugh!!!). Then there are the documentaries: Shadowing The Third Man is a documentary that shows long snatches of the film and moves along slowly, as it would if it was sold to fill a 90-minute space but had less than 10 minutes of real content; the film provides at the start some Zeitgeist, it seems that 270,000 men were killed in World War II, and 500,000 were in prisoner of war camps or in exile, so women were largely responsible for rebuilding the city. Reed and Selznik argued over Anita Valli's clothes, Selznik thought that they were too dowdy for a big star. Paul Horbiger couldn't speak a word of English and had to be coached by phoneticists. Hedwig Bleibtreu, the landlady, was 82 at the time, but she always showed up on time for filming, never arrived late. A now-adult Hansi talked about his role, how he was just playing himself. The documentary shows cool morphs from modern Vienna to scenes form the movie, such as the cat scene, and the 300 km of sewers. The Ferris Wheel was deep in the Soviet zone, a sort of propaganda set to display the wonders of communism. ""Harry is in only 10% of the film, the love triangle is only complete for a sort scene. Welles wondering ""how anyone can work in these conditions. Sewer police were mobilised for the shoot. In some scenes we can see Orson Welles' breath in the cold weather, these were the scenes filmed on site. Also, we learn that those are Carol Reed's fingers poking through the grill to demonstrate some great non-verbal dialogue. There are also four very important lines cut from the end of the film:

  - Calloway - What happened?
  - Martins - I couldn't bear his pain, I put a bullet through him.""
  - Calloway - We'll forget that bit.""
  - Martins - I never shall!""

The dialogue, however, is replaced by Harry's nod, and some of the body language between Cotton and Welles (and Trevor Howard, in a few seconds) is just what it is.
The script called for, and the crew filmed, a scene where Anna was kidnapped by the Soviets, but this was cut from the film to make it less political (I almost wish that they had included it - there was so much noise about her passport and the Russian authorities, it was irritating and irrelevant otherwise. On the other hand, it also never got boring.

""The Third Man theme"" was a #1 hit on the Variety Charts in the week ending June 10th, 1950. Hard as it to imagine, for a brief period the world was in the grips of zither mania!! But as a result of the European success of The Third Man, Korda kidnapped the negative, and the relationship with him and David Selznik deteriorated.

There are two tracks of commentary on the DVD, one by filmmakers Stephen Soderbergh and Tony Gilroy that is not very interesting at all, but film scholar Dana Polan offers a strong commentary throughout the film, and we learn a few things from him, as well as the film theory stuff about the type of film that it was, a ""binary film"" that provided tension between values, identity, moralising, as well as between the old world and the new, the artistic world of European film and the commercial world of Hollywood, which is already suggested in the credits. Polan describes Holly as a brash, cocky American who's a bit slow on the uptake and a prime example of the ugly American abroad (Soderbergh and Gilroy are harder on his character, calling him a blank nothing who never really succeeds at anything of his own accord - he's a bit of a Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski in that regard). For the early scene of Martins walking under a ladder, it depicts him walking of his own volition right into a world of bad luck. Holly was supposed to be a British cahracter, but David O. Selznik insisted on an American. Bernard Lee, who was M in the Bond films, plays Seargent Paine. Parallels exist in the film with the formula westerns that Holly writes, that whole ""sherrif telling the stranger to be on the next stagecoach out of town if he knows what's good for him.""

The packaging of the DVD is stunning also - the first disc shows the full ferris wheel on its round shape, while the second disc shows the mesh of cables and supports seen from inside a cabin, symbolically depicting the object from the outside (the full movie) and its inner workings (the documentaries about the movie and its dissection).

""Who Was The Third Man"" is a documentary in German by Austria's Wien-Kanal, it starts with a jazz intro with the theme song. It gave more zeitgeist than other films, explaining that on March 10th, 1950, the film opened in Vienna, and 120,000 went to see it in following weeks, curious to see how Vienna would be portrayed in an American film.

Someone made the comment that the grave where they filmed Harry's multiple burials is not occupied by someone called Grn, which is German for ""green""; Lime also means green. There are other similarities - Greene stayed at the Hotel Sacher, like the writer Holly Martins does, and he was also in 1948 to give a talk at the British Council, like Martins also is. Stylistically, the documentary moves from colour to black and white, as if to achieve some goal. But the documentary does explain that Greene knew British spymaster and traitor Kim Philby, who was in the area at the time, and how Greene rubbed shoulders with master spies, and after he had rubbed shoulders with these people, had heard the racketeering tales. There's footage of Paul Horbinger talking about the film in 1979, and more discussion about the soundtrack. Reed wanted a non-virtuoso to do the zither soundtrack, wanted it to sound broken and cracked, like Vienna itself. For the first recording, all that Anton Karas did was a first take, and for the first recording all he got was a blue suit, he was happy. Later he became a millionaire, selling 40 million records, and opened up his own club. Couldn't read or write music, though, it seems.

The sewers: there were 7,500 km when the documentary was made in 2007, but in 1949 when the film was made there were 3,000 km). Sewer shooting needed four weeks. Welles' body double was a butcher Otto Schusser. Then there is a nice final shot of the long walk - the host walks down the side as they re-produce the original film's final shot.

Another documentary is Graham Greene: The Hunted Man, A 1968 profile of Graham Greene with Christopher Burnstall, which touches on nearly all of his work up until that point except for ""The Third Man"". Funny. Starts off with Greene's passport, and its many stamps, all from countries that we know he's visited because his stories are set there. Then there is the discussion - which Greene only allowed to be audio-taped, he didn't want to become a non-serious writer who becomes a TV comedian - that touches upon so many topics, such as Greene's life, and where he felt hunted: Indochina, during the London Blitz, and by the Catholic faith. ""Human nature is not black and white, but black and gray."" The conversation takes place on the Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul, traveling through Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Three days, two nights, with no restaurant car. Feels a writer should not be recognised, likes borders, but never wants to stay in any one place too long or let the ice get too thick. Used to play Russian roulette, but one bullet in a chamber was too few for him, he lost the kick, so he put in two bullets! He met the pope, who had read The Power And The Glory and was surprised that his books were black listed. ""Some parts of your books will always offend some Catholics; you shouldn't pay any attention to them whatsovever."" Talks about smoking opium in Indochina, but that he'd only have 10 pipes on three occasions in a given week and that real addicts would have 50-250 pipes a day. Smoking in pairs is social, and anyone could get a full night's sleep with any amount. How wonderful.

There are brief interviews with students: ""I don't think that any of Greene's heroes are heroes; they're just ordinary people who've gotten themselves in a mess.""

  - The war does spoil everything,doesn't it?
  - it gives the young men a chance.

Greene became a Catholic before his first book, and it was a secret for 10 years, but by Brighton Rock it was obvious. Never wrote about Nazi Germany, Hitler was a boring subject. Liked gossip, would listen to what women, priests, lawyers and doctors had to say to each other. Did psychoanalysis, needed to keep a dream diary. Used to write 500 words a day, later came down to 200 words a day. Continues to write, even when it is going badly. Beginning and ending of a project is clear in its framework, then there's the mountain range in between the two and a hope for surprises.

Carol Reed's brilliant film of Graham Greene's post-War novel quickly turns into an existential noir mystery capturing the creepy look and feel of post WWII Vienna which has become a black cauldron of pararnoia as the Americans, British and Russians occupy the city each trying to outwit the other.

This reissue from StudioCanal/Lion's Gate is inferior looking to the superb brief release by Criterion (before their license was up). That transfer was crisp looking with considerable repair work done in the digital realm to the film while the transfer itself was sharper with solid blacks, great fine detail considering the age of the film and grain management wasn't over-the-top. This edition features the over use of digital noise reduction often smoothing out the noir look of the film by robbing it of its atmospheric grain resulting in the images looking a bit softered and smeared.

The audio isn't as clear or as consistent as the Criterion release; you can hear the pops and imperfections from the original analog soundtrack here whereas Criterion smoothed those out removing them and also did some leveling so that the dialogue and music is consistent throughout in terms of volume neither of which is the case with this new edition of the film.

That isn't to say that the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is horrible; ""The Third Man"" looks decent although there's evident damage to the print that hasn't been repaired that crops up throughout the movie. Compared to the Criterion edition from 2008, the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is inferior in every way but not a bad presentation of the film by any means and is worth the upgrade if you are a hugh fan of the film.

The extras here are different than the Criterion edition. The Criterion had among other things a 90 minute excellent doucmentary that ""shadowed"" the making of this terrific film as well as the original treatment by Greene, a radio episode of Welles' excellent series ""The Lives of Harry Lime"", two exceptional audio commentaries for the film and press booklet materials and an hour program on writer Graham Greene.

THIS edition has an excellent commentary track featuring Welles biographer and actor Simon Callow along with assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen. It's a fairly lively and entertaining commentary track that covers everything from Greene's original script, issues they had shooting on location to working with Welles and Cotton (and disspelling some myths about Welles ""directing"" his own scenes). It's the best special feature here and kudos to StudioCanal/Lion's Gate for assembling it. I do wish more thought had gone into the other special features however.

We get an interactive tour of post WWII Vienna, interviews with Joseph Cotton (from 1987) and Graham Greene as well as a 1951 episode of ""The Lives of Harry Lime"" entitled ""A Ticket to Tangiers"". The Lux radio adaptation of ""The Third Man"" and a featurette on the zither played by Cornelia Mayer who played the instrument in the film. We also get the alternate opening narration, stills and other minor extras.

If you missed the chance to pick up the Criterion on Blu-ray, this edition is a good second choice. Although the film doesn't look quite as good in its presentation and while some of the extras are very similar we are missing the excellent 90 minute documentary on the making of the film as well as the other two audio commentary tracks from the Criterion, a 60 minute program on Greene and a 30 minute documentary from down under. Unlike the recent ""The Stranger"" on Blu-ray that was a public domain print, this edition of ""The Third Man"" is from similar elements (and perhaps the same print)as that provided to Criterion with just the clean up work and restoration that Criterion did missing here.

Still recommended but if you have the Criterion--keep it.",1303689600,7,4216,4.951909476661952

But the film is really something. Everything just, works. It all combines in a magical goulash of sensory impressions, suspense, and thoughtful provocation. All the little threads knit together seamlessly. It is a film that relies heavily on style, but all of the acting is so nuanced, and understated. This may be Joseph Cotton's best role, although Orson Welles is also a standout. So many wheels within wheels, subterfuge within subterfuge, in postwar Vienna. So many great lines:

""You were born to be murdered.""

""In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace - and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""

""We should have dug a deeper grave!""

""Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we? They talk about the people and the proletariat, I talk about the suckers and the mugs - it's the same thing. They have their five-year plans, so have I.""

Here is a man loved by two people, his boyhood friend, and his most recent lover. This man is also wanted by the Authorities for the grim act of diluting penicillin and selling it on the black market, with terrible repercussions to little children in the grip of an outbreak of meningitis. What to do? You love the man but the conduct was monstrous, and you never really knew the man. When looking down on people from a great height, they look like little dots. ""Victims? Don't be melodramatic. [gestures to people far below] Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever? If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped, would you really, old man, tell me to keep my money, or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare? Free of income tax, old man. Free of income tax - the only way you can save money nowadays.""

What is the nature of loyalty? Loyalty to people--or loyalty to a principle? What does it take to bring a sword, instead of peace between friends and loved ones? When the people we love are wolves in sheeps clothing--what does it take to see the wolf in them? Anna, Harry Lime's former lover says""A person doesn't change because you find out more."" But Hollly, the old friend, isn't so sure. This Harry Lime he discovers in Vienna--he has hurt innocent people, little children, badly. Old friend or not--Who do you love? What do you love? When do you love? and Why do you love?

Everything that makes a movie brilliant is here: Actors, script, cinematography, music... To see Joseph Cotten standing alone at the end while the woman walks on by is so bleak. Orson Welles evidently felt that Holly Martin's betrayal of his character was bad, which I always thought was strange because the character of Lime was presented as all show: his was a fake exterior; when you thought about him and his actions he WAS a bad person. He was one of those people who are always the center of attention and have everyone wanting to be around them because of the fun. The more one thinks about him, minus his glamorous and romantic exterior, the more one realizes that there is a rotten core to the man. This movie presents  questions about good and evil... About murky thoughts and actions and what people are willing to do about them. Holly Martin will not be the romantic interest because he  just isn't the romantic interest; not compared to Lime, anyway. Brilliant film!",1302048000,5,1157,4.5311004784688995

The intoxicating atmosphere of this film noir gem owes much to the musical score laid down by zither virtuoso Anton Karas, as well as iconic scenes made possible by Vienna landmarks.  There is also the intrigue of a city partitioned by the Allied powers in the fashion of Berlin--I remember as a student visiting the monument to the Russian liberation!  It seems that the hero's old friend has gotten mixed up in the smuggling of the precious penicillin upon which such many lives depend, and is now suspiciously reported as dead (or is he?).  Holly is soon hot on the trail of the malevolent beings thought to be responsible for these alleged crimes.  His search leads to an encounter with his nemesis, in a car of the Rad (the giant Viennese ferris wheel) perched dangerously high above the city, that is saturated with lethal menace.  Even Holly's surprise invitation to the prestigious Viennese Literary Society (supposedly for the benefit of those intrigued by pulp cowboy fiction) is full of troubling questions.

The director keenly used the wet streets of Post-WW2 Vienna as the stage, effective and intriguing. The steaming streets almost had an eery life to them. But what struck me the most was the brilliant sound-track... It rang out in just the right places, plenty loud, but never interfering with the dialogue.

Orson Wells was spectacular, a mysteriously missing ""third man"" for half the film, then appears with a shot of a kitten purring at his feet! Somehow he plays the villain, but reels in the audience to be cheering for him in the fantastic finalee sewer scenes. An exploitation of man's sense of greed.

Let's not forget Joe Cotton and Carol Reed as the love triangle. How could it be done any better then the third man coming back from the dead? Reed plays the perfect and the most beautiful saddened soul.

677064,4,630347327X,"Blame it on Rita (Rita Hayworth that is) No, not this time. This time blame it on Orson Welles. Let me explain. I started out earlier this year viewing (or, more correctly, re-viewing) many of the classic film noir films of the 1940s. In the process I was smitten, very smitten, by Ms. Hayworth's performance in her 1946 classic femme fatale role, Gilda, where she dances, strums and sings (okay, okay lip synch's) her way through the film all while looking, ah, beautiful, ravishing, alluringly beautiful. Needless to say I needed to investigate this issue more, cinematically that is, and another noir classic Lady From Shang-hai naturally came up. And just as naturally, Orson Welles, as the smitten, very smitten Irish Blackie (join the line, brother) came up. So then I went off on to that Wellesian tangent and Touch Of Evil fell into place and then here to The Third Man. Simple, right?

As the headline connotes this one is about the present whereabouts of one American expatriate, Harry Lyme (Orson Welles, of course), in immediate post-World War II four zone-occupied Vienna American, British, French and Russian) and his nefarious dealings in the flourishing black market, including vitally needed but watered-down drugs. The heat is on and so he needs alibis, and better a disappearance, staged or otherwise. The plot is driven, relentlessly so at times, by American friend and writer, Holly Martin's (Joseph Cotton) search for his old friend, whether he is dead or alive. Old Harry, as is his wont, though makes few appearances here until near the end when he is running the sewers like the rat he is dodging the police of those four occupying nations. Director Carol Reed has caught the banal, barren sense of war-torn, bombed out Vienna, and the faces of its inhabitants cinematically in a way that author Graham Greene must have appreciated in this early Cold War thriller.

His best friend, Holly Martin [Joseph Cotton], can hardly believe that such a great man has died in such an ordinary way, starts a one-man investigation opposed by the British occupation police, personified in the Major [Trevor Howard].

There's a mysterious beautiful woman--Harry's mistress--who grieves pitifully at the loss of her lover.  Holly tries to console her but the woman is riven by grief and spends much of the film in tears.

The film is dark and brooding.  The effects of lighting and angle are superb.  Vienna is still larely wrecked by Allied bombing and many of the scenes show a background of rubbled buildings on which workmen are laboring exactly like busy ants.  This depersonalization of human beings plays into the film.  Turns out that Harry wasn't quite the savant his friend, Holly, thought him to be.  Harry was the brains behind an opperation in which limited Penicillin supplies are diluted and sold to doctors, hospitals and clinics with the results that patients, including children with meningitis, are damaged or die.

From a ferris wheel, Harry explains his philosophy to Holly.  I'll paraphrase.  'See those dots down there [meaning people].  What difference does it make if they keep on moving or are blotted out?  Remember the Italian Wars?  They went on for hundreds of years and produced Michelangelo, da Vinci and the Renaissance.  The Swiss, at the same time, had 500 years of democracy and produced the---Cuckoo Clock.'

So, when a gem of a film like ""The Third Man"" is released in the Blu-ray format, our hearts jump with joy. This is truly one great cinematic experience, a movie that shall not be buried in history.

Directed and produced by Carol Reed, and based on a novel and screenplay by Graham Greene, ""The Third Man"" takes place in Vienna, Austria, in a time when it was occupied by the Americans, French, English and Russians, with part of the city pretty much in rubbles after World War II. It is under these conditions that Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives from the United States to this beautiful city. He is supposed to meet Harry Lime (Orson Welles), an old friend, who promised him a job. But, to Holly's surprise, he is informed that Harry recently died, after being accidently hit by a car, just in front of the apartment building in which he lived. However, not being satisfied with the official story of his friend's death, Holly begins asking questions about what might have really happened. In doing so, he talks to Anna (the very beautiful Alida Valli), and some shady characters, discovering that there was a third man involved in aiding his friend after he was hit by the vehicle, instead of the two that were identified by the police. This causes Holly problems with Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), who is investigating the case, and insists that Harry was a racketeer. As a result, we are provided with delightful suspense, in which one surprise follows the next, aided by a penetrating soundtrack, great photography, and moments of humor. A true delight.

Famed movie critic Roger Ebert is quoted as saying, ""Of all the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies."" I just can't say it better. ""The Third Man"" was awarded an Oscar in 1949 for Best Cinematography (Robert Krasker), as well as the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  The awesome Blu-ray edition, in addition to a booklet with an essay about the film, also includes audio commentaries by assistant director Guy Hamilton, Simon Callow, and 2nd Unit Script Supervisor Angela Allen; The Third Man interactive Vienna Tour; The Third Man on radio; and much, much more. This one is definitely a keeper. (UK, 1949, B&W, 105 min plus additional materials)

677170,5,630347327X,"All of the technical aspects of The Third Man are superb, including the cinematography by Robert Krasker, and the memorable scoring by Anton Karas, whose zither music became a mid-century craze. It's truly amazing how much emotion was wrung out of one very particular instrument. The Criterion Collection DVD package has the British version of the film, which is longer (104 to 93 minutes) than the American version, and superior. The British version opens with a voiceover narration by Reed, while the American version's voiceover is by Cotton, as Martins. Aside from a slightly better framing of the film, Reed's voice acts as an anonymous omniscient, whereas Cotton's voiceover sets up the film as possibly being too intimate a viewpoint of Martins. It is a two disk package, and one of the best the company has produced since it went `lite' in its features, after adopting the semi-circle large C logo. The transfer is shown in a 1.33: aspect ratio, and it's a good print- not perfect, but good. The second disk has many good features, such as a 90 minute long making of documentary called Shadowing The Third Man; an hour long 1968 episode of the British television series Omnibus, featuring an audio interview with Graham Greene- one quite daring in its presentation, called Graham Greene: The Hunted Man; an episode of the radio series The Lives Of Harry Lime; a 30 minute Austrian documentary called Who Was the Third Man?; a Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film; Joseph Cotton's American version voiceover for the film; and a few other minor things, including the film's American trailer. There is also a booklet with a few minor essays on the film, from Luc Sante, Charles Drazin, and Philip Kerr. Even better features await on the first disk which, aside from housing the film, has a video introduction by the world's most famous ex-filmmaker, and `personal' pal of Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich, and two audio commentaries on the film. The first is with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy. They make an odd pair, as neither had any even indirect association with the film. It's enjoyable, as the two banter on in filmese, but compared to Soderbergh's commentary with Lem Dobbs on The Limey, it simply does not compare- probably due to the fact that Gilroy is a hack screenwriter of Hollywood junk, whereas Dobbs is not. Much better is the commentary track by film scholar Dana Polan. As with his review of Angels With Dirty Faces, Polan is thorough, detailed, scene specific, and enthused to the point of never letting any dead spots break through his audio. He has, in the two commentaries I've listened to, proven to be a rival to both film critic Roger Ebert and film director Francis Ford Coppola as the best commentarian going, although he does err in claiming that the blank slate Anna is as important a character in the film as Martins. Overall, it's an excellent package.

  The Third Man won the Grand Prix at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award for Best Film, and the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in 1950. It deserved those honors and more, for, despite the claims of would be glad-handers of the film, it was well above standard Hitchcockian thrillers. It is also, along with Casablanca, often pointed to as an exception to the auteur theory of filmmaking, in terms of making great cinema. Of course, since that theory is cracked, it matters little, and since Casablanca is not a great film, to begin with, it's not an apt connection. But it is certainly a film noir, as Harry Lime is probably the best, if not most perfect, antihero that genre's ever come up with. He is both unscrupulous in general, but with a definite set of principles regarding those around him. He is capable of cruelty and betrayal, but also decency. And finally, to return to the obvious, that this film far more easily falls into the canon of Welles than Reed, let me state again that I, in no way, doubt, that Reed directed many, if not most, of the scenes of the film. But the best scenes, the ones that are remembered; those with arresting visuals and splendid speeches (including the overlapping of dialogue)- those are the Welles touch, and Welles clearly had an enormous impact on the film's direction and overall flow: in short, he was the main force, if not the primogenitor, of the project. He said so, and implied so, on more than one occasion, and even in the extra features of the DVD, in an interview where Welles dutifully honors his commitment to denial, one can almost see the sour turn of his face and the hesitance in his voice to disown his baby. By contrast, Reed went on to direct many more mediocre to solid films in his otherwise forgettable career. And for those who have tried to, in a latter day fashion, claim that Reed was a far better director than that he really was, all I can say is, why was the man only touched with greatness during the lone project that involved Welles, and no others? Simply put: greatness in art does not spike out of nowhere; it is part of an arc that is discernible. And if one still disbelieves that, just watch the rest of the films in the two men's respective canons, and it's clear that The Third Man is more Welles than Reed, for the creative impulse simply does not work as the current mythology of the film would have one believe, no matter what any commission might tell you!",1283299200,3,5412,4.7127771911298835

677173,5,630347327X,"One has only to watch a few scenes from The Third Man to notice what a difference a change of music makes. In startling contrast to the darker orchestral or jazz inspired scores of most other noir films, The Third Man's score was composed by Anton Karas, whose jaunty zither melodies are simply unlike anything else you've ever heard. Karas, believe it or not, was discovered in a tavern in Vienna, where the film takes place.

I will admit, there are times at which the zither seem to pull you out of the mood a bit, simply because if you've watched enough noir you expect a certain musical atmosphere - but The Third Man refuses to give you what you expect. You hear something almost happy, but you know this can't be right. All in all, this works profoundly to disorient the viewer in a most artful way.

The Third Man contains my favorite cinematic sequence of all time - the last scene. I won't give it away for those who might not have seen it, but the music simply makes it, and throws the entire genre to the wind. The movie creates something wholly different, although there are plenty of iconic noir scenes and devices and camera angles prior to this point.

Orson Welles, as if it hasn't been stated before, plays a near perfect villain, and catalyzes outer and internal conflict within our protagonist that is so...well, noir.",1281830400,,1338,4.566666666666666

The music throughout was ""The Third Man Theme"" with the zither's upbeat circus-like twang ringing oddly between the film's dark and shadowy black and white murder mystery.

Unemployed pulp mystery novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cogtten) arrives in post-world-war II Vienna, hoping to live with a childhood friend Harry (Orson Wells).  Holly is ""between books"" and has little income, so he is grateful when his friend offers him room and board in Vienna, as well as a one-way airline ticket to get there.  When he arrives, Holly learns that his friend Harry has died in an accident.  He is in time for the burial and arrives at the graveyard confused and shocked at the events.  Compelled to investigate the death, Holly slowly uncovers startling revelations about Harry's life.

The visuals alone make this film (DVD) worth owning.  The movie dragged a little in the beginning and Orson Wells does not appear until after about an hour of viewing.  Many questions arise during the first part that are chewed over with looks and glances, but no real ""grab"" to the viewer.  After Orson Wells appears there is more action and interest.

There are a lot of dark corners, nighttime chases on cobblestone streets as well as beneath Vienna's rubble in sewer labyrinths.  The close-ups and angles give the film a touch of class as the mystery unfolds.",1279756800,,1454,4.913934426229508

677176,5,630347327X,"Aftre the end of the Second World War, both Hollywood and London film studios tended to view current European drama against the still crumbling ruins of a devastated continent. It was not enough to show that Nazism had been vanquished; it was needed to show how evil could mask itself under the visage of goodness and friendship.  In THE THIRD MAN, director Carol Reed took the novel by Graham Greene (who also wrote the screenplay) to present the collision of values in Vienna, a city that was closed in in more than one sense.  For several years after the war, Vienna was divided in zones, just as Berlin was. There was a British zone, and others for Americans, French, and Russian.  One needed a passport to travel not so freely from one zone to another.  Into this closed off city comes Joseph Cotton as hack writer Holly Martins, who was invited by his long time friend Harry Lime (Orson Wells).  Martins has known Lime only as an upstanding stand up guy for whom he has only the greatest respect. Martins is shocked to discover that Limes is dead and that there is a question about whether his demise in a car accident was truly accidental or deliberate.  As soon as Martins learns of this possibility, the film takes him deeper into the sordid world of the criminal underside of Vienna.  Trevor Howard is a policeman who suggests that Lime may not be the angel that Martins thinks he is, and that in fact Lime may be the worst sort of self-aggrandizing thug imaginable.  This tendency to re-evaluate one's long-held image of a respected friend is mirrored by Anna Schmidt, a local girl who has loved Lime and finds it just as difficult to explain away a mountain of evidence against Lime. Complicating matters is the growing love that Martins feels for her.

Orson Wells gets seconday billing just under Joseph Cotton although he does not appear until midway through.  We think he is dead; then miraculously he appears risen from the ashes, like Lazarus to explain to Martins his resurrection.  From Lime's own mouth, Martins learns that the stories circulated by the police are revoltingly true after all.  Lime makes no apologies for his crimes.  In fact in a film filled with gripping camera work, stark imagery, and an oddly jangling musical score, Lime creates an indelible impression of how one man could take the misery of others and transform that misery into a rationale for personal gain.  As both Lime and Martins are aloft in a ferris wheel, Lime peers down at the tiny human beings on the ground and philosophizes: ""If you could earn twenty thousand dollars to kill any one or all of them, would you do so?""  Lime assumes that the question is rhetorical and that the answer ought to be the same as his. At that momemt, a twang resounds in Martins' mind that parallels a similar epiphany of Anna Schmidt's about the seductiveness of pure evil.

Those who sing the praises of THE THIRD MAN rightfully point out the masterful job of acting, scripting, camera work, and directing of all concerned, but what made the film click for me was the journey taken, as did Marlow in THE HEART OF DARKNESS, of the descent that some take into a maelstrom of moral destruction.  Both Martins and Anna must face the ugly truth that evil often succeeds, not because good men do nothing to stop it, but rather because evil can hide its agenda under a smiling face and reassuring words.  THE THIRD MAN is a stark and grim reminder that we must look more deeply into the souls of those who promise heaven but instead deliver damnation.",1277510400,2,3534,4.645264847512038

However, I would not spend 58.00 to get this one because people are selling it as a rare item now.  It's not worth the extra money over a standard version because of this.  It was worth it at 20.00 or so used over a standard priced dvd; however now that it's out of print I would say hold off unless you must have this as a blu ray edition in your collection. The film itself is one of the cinemas most influential movies and is a true classic. That being said avoid the blu ray version unless it comes back into print because the clarity is better but the grain of this movie really comes out on this version. I didn't mind it because I didn't pay some seller a overprice on it.  I have read that other criterion blu rays are less grainy so it's this print that was shot that way probably.  However if you can get a cheaper copy of this one on blu ray then grab it.  This edition has the same bonus features including the alterante opening, several radio shows featuring Orson Welles and the Harry Lime character. And other features, It also gives a good impression of how shattered austria was after the world war but at least Austria had the soviets leave it and the whole country was allowed to become a democratic nation.  The underrated Joseph Cotton also shines in this movie and it's one of his best performances.  This movie is a masterpiece well worth owning in your collection but you can't expect the type of blu ray clarity that a modern movie has. However I do agree that grain should be removed from older movies if possible. But it is a better looking print than any that have been around for a long time.",1265587200,2,2209,4.252983293556086
677271,5,630347327X,"If you are a fan of 1940s black and white film noir you're in for a real treat with ""The Third Man.""  This film's cinamatogaphy is incredibly beautiful, as are the camera angles, the lighting, and music sound track.  Anton Karas provides the zither music for the film introduction and as edge of your seat accompaniment throughout the movie, which adds to the intensity of the story.  The setting for the film is post-Second World War Vienna, with emphasis put on the black market profiteering going on in that time.  Here, we find out that the film's villain, an American named Harry Lime, was making scads of money from his involvement in racketeeing in watered down penicillin.  There was little enough of this drug to go around to treat the severely injured.  Many babies died or were suffered permanent crippling and catastrophic illnesses after having this worthless medication administered to them.

Holly Martins, an American writer of pulp fiction/dime store novels, as played by well-cast actor Joseph Cotten, arrives in Vienna on the promise of a job from his good friend, Harry Lime.  Soon after Martins inquires about his friend, he is told that Lime was killed as the result of a hit and run car accident.  The facts point to other conclusions.  Martins meets Lime's girlfriend, Anna, as played by the beautiful Alida Valli, who has her own problems related to her status in allied occupied Vienna.  Orson Welles is quite sinister as Harry Lime, while maintaining a certain amount of charm which enables him to retain a touch of undeserved sympathy.  We are introduced to Orson Welles's character in a rather amusing and startling manner which adds to the film's noir appeal.  Martin's loyalty to Lime can only go so far, and their relationship, as well as Lime's career, end very badly.  The film's ending is very unsettling for all concerned, but this scintillating and beautifully photographed work of art, nevertheless proves to be, at least in my opinion, one of most suspenseful and satisfying post-war films ever made.",1265587200,,2039,4.941348973607038

677274,2,630347327X,"If you think the Devil is fascinating, then this is the movie for you.

Heralded as a masterpiece, the only thing masterful about this movie is it does a good job of expressing the point of view of persons who think other persons who are moral, normal and physically plain make for a dreary world, while persons who are physically attractive, street-smart, daring, and often, morally compromised, make the world interesting, and life worth living.

Jesus Christ said that if we don't hate our lives, and this world, than we can have no part with Him. People who reject Christ's words look for ways to make life worthwhile, and many of them settle for all-that-glitters, mistaking it for gold.

The ""masterly"" technique used here is simple - the protagonist is played by Joseph Cotton, an actor deliberately chosen for his mild manner and less than striking appearance. Errol Flynn or Humphrey Bogart he is not. Cotton cannot light up the screen because he is not supposed to. Moreover, he arrives in Vienna almost broke; a failed third-rate novelist - the guy is hapless. Cotton is supposed to represent the inoffensive but also unexciting normal American man of his day, with predictable responses and a WASP moral code. However, the viewer is not supposed to be conscious of what Cotton represents, at least not early on in the film. Almost never is the chief protagonist in any story a weak character, so even though Cotton's character, Holly, starts off weak, the audience is expecting big things from him.

He meets a woman who may have known his friend, Harry; Harry who was supposed to host him in Vienna, Austria but has been killed in an accident. The woman, though attractive, is portrayed as nothing special at first. However, as the story develops the screenwriter subtly shapes the woman into someone very attractive to male and female viewers, owing to her vulnerability, her desire to avoid repatriation to communist Russia, and other devices that make her irresistible. As she grows more striking, hapless Holly begins to look more and more the rube.

Eventually Harry, played by Orson Wells, is introduced to the audience. The audience, now panting for a male protagonist worthy of the fascinating female is refreshed with a long cool drink when Wells lights up the screen. Problem is, Harry, Well's character, is a deeply morally-compromised person. He has the blood of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of innocent people, including small children, on his hands. He is also the woman's former lover.  Though the woman is in Vienna illegally, and obviously has loose sexual mores, and though Harry is, in effect, a mass murderer, the script is written in such as way that we are supposed to admire the woman and Harry. Of course, try as he might to be someone special, we come to view the straight arrow, plain-man Holly as just perennially one step behind; simply not as ""with it""; not as hip, not as daring, and certainly not a potentially interesting sexual partner. Harry, on the other hand, may be responsible for the death of infants, but doggonit, he is fascinating, and wouldn't he be exciting to have sex with him...that's how were supposed to react.

In many ways this film is sick and twisted. And for you bored-with-life hip, lefties out there who are awed by this movie, I just want you to know that I am proud to be a plain-vanilla, boring, morally straight guy; the kind that responds when you need a policeman or firefighter; the kind who won't stab you in the back or steal your girl when your not looking. As I pass by outside the bar you frequent I'll see you, Mr. or Ms. Hipster, pretending you're in the fast lane as you sit on the bar seat in the smoke-filled bar, slyly trying to hook-up with a twenty-something member of the opposite sex, packing a hidden STD.

677275,5,630347327X,"I was quite impressed with the blu-ray transfer. The last time I'd seen this film was when Criterion released it on DVD for the first time. Although the print still has some major blemishes on it, overall the image is free of most of those pesky little artifacts. I would say it is 98% clean. The grain level varies throughout, sometimes becoming quite intense, almost overpowering, but that is part of the original film's elements, not because of the transfer. Detail is quite excellent, revealing little details in people's clothing and hair, as well as all of the sets and locations. The mono sound design is clean and clear, especially the dialogue. One thing that is nice about the higher bitrate encode potential on blu-ray is that dialogue becomes far more natural sounding and more intelligible than what you get from a DVD.

677276,5,630347327X,"In 1950, Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" would gain worldwide recognition for its story, cinematography and it's soundtrack.  Winning the 1949 Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the film would win a British Academy Award for Best Film and an Academy Award for ""Best Black and White Cinematography"".

Directed by Carol Reed (The Running Man"", ""Oliver!"", ""Follow Me""), ""The Third Man"" is an adaptation of a novela by Graham Greene (""The Quiet American"", ""Double Take"", ""Strike It Rich"")  who also penned the original screenplay.  The film would feature music by Anton Karas and cinematography by Robert Krasker (""The Criminal"", ""Cry Wolf"" and ""The Quiet American"").

But the film would also receive top honors with the film being selected by the British French Institute as the best British Film of the 20th Century, 57th on the American Film Institute's list of top American films and  is regard by cinema fans as one of the great films made of all time.

Although released on DVD from THE CRITERION COLLECTION in the past, the film has now underwent through modern restoration and was released on Blu-ray in Dec. 2008.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Third Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  According to Criterion, ""The picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors.  On widescreen televisions, black bars will appear on the left and right of the image to maintain the proper screen format.  This high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a restored 35 mm time-grain master positive.""

As with most Criterion Blu-ray releases, the company also had thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

The picture quality, although in black and white, looks incredible for a film created in 1949.  Black are nice and deep but you can see a lot more detail in the surroundings.

Suffice to say, THE CRITERION COLLECTION releases films with how the director intended the film to be.  There is no DNR (digital noise reduction) and no softness and the film keeps the grain and retains its film-like quality.  The film just looks beautiful on Blu-ray!  I didn't own the previous Criterion release on DVD, fans of the film have commented that this Blu-ray release features the definitive picture quality for the ""The Third Man"".

Although Robert Krasker's cinematography was criticized at the time for using an tilted/angled view, fans have shown their appreciation for Krasker's artistic style.  I personally enjoyed the cinematography of the film.

As for audio, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical soundtrack and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The audio has an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  My Onkyo receiver received a multichannel signal (via bitstream) but overall, audio dialogue is understandable and clear.  And Anton Karas's music sounds absolutely beautiful.

Subtitles are featured in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

After watching ""The Third Man"", I must admit that so many things were going through my mind.  For one, the talents were well-cast, the cinematography and the amount of cuts and smooth editing was fantastic, the music was memorable and most of all the storyline was well-planned.

Because the film took place right after World War II, the destruction of Vienna and what was going on at the time with people having to sell their jewelry and belongings just to get bread and butter due to the heavy rationing at the time is captured.  The penicillin stolen from American medical areas and were meant to take care of the wounded and sick but being sold in the black market and that story of racketeering is captured in the film.  Also, how Vienna was separated into four zones is integrated into the storyline of the film through the various shots of key locations was well-planned.

So, in some sense, this film is also a snapshot of a time in history and why it remains so popular in the minds of many cinema fans but also a sign of pain for some who live in Austria and seeing how things were at the time the film was being shot.  Even many historians on Vienna's history are impressed of how much the film captures that difficult time in Vienna history and also has actual footage from that time.

But there are just so many memorable scenes that stick in my head.  From the music (which was #1 in the charts and started a zither craze) to certain shots where shadows were effectively used, Vienna was well integrated into the film and who can forget the child screaming after his father is killed and trying to place the blame on the wrong person.  Or even the final shot of the film.  There are so many moments in this film that stay strong in your head.

But what I found so fantastic about this release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION was the amount of bonus content.  It's one thing to get audio commentaries but two documentaries, radio shows and many more.  That's awesome to receive so much content for an older film such as ""The Third Man"".  Bonus content that actually is quite entertaining, especially when you find out how volatile things were behind-the-scenes.  Surprising to say the least.

Overall, ""The Third Man"" is a film and a Blu-ray release worth having in your HD collection.  It's also important to note that because THE CRITERION COLLECTION has recently lost the rights to this film, if you want to own the definitive version of this film, you better get it now before the prices skyrocket for the Blu-ray or DVD release.

""The Third Man - THE CRITERION COLLECTION"" is highly recommended!",1256601600,20,9031,4.940903054448871
677277,5,630347327X,"The Third Man must be ranked with Double Indemnity as the finest film noir ever made.  It is an astonishing movie.  The music is the first thing that catches and holds the attention of the viewer.  Anton Karas's zither supports the action of the film from first to last.  At times the music dominates and controls the mood and enhances suspense as the story unfolds.  Otherwise the music plays quietly in the background supporting the dialogue of the eclectic cast of characters.  The movie stars Orson Welles, but we don't see him until late in the film in what must be the most astonishing entrance by an actor in the history of cinema.  I won't spoil this surprise for the first-time viewer, but only say again that Welles' long awaited entrance was worth the wait.

The underrated Joseph Cotten (Holly Martins) has more screen time than any other actor and he does a creditable job anchoring the story line.  Cotten is confronted with a criminal dossier compiled on his friend Welles (Harry Lime) that he refuses to believe until the dogged policeman (Trevor Howard) provides indisputable evidence of Welles' evil doings.  The beautiful and mysterious Alida Valli loves Welles and to the end stays true to him.  In one of the most creative and effective endings in the history of the movies, we watch and wonder what Valli will do as she leaves the cemetery that begins and ends the film. Like Cotton, we watch her as she approaches us.  We are not disappointed with the perfect ending to a great film.

The Third Man was shot on location in Vienna - mostly at night - and the ruins of the city play an important part in the development of the story line.  This is a ""noir"";  the shadows cast on the walls of the ruined buildings and in the underground sewer where a great a final chase scene takes place support the mystery and suspense director Carol Reed takes great pains to create from opening frame until closing credits.  Welles slips in and out of the shadows; he is seen only once in daylight at the justly famous Ferris Wheel confrontation with Cotten where Welles talks about the expendable dots (people) on the ground far bellow that he is willing to sacrifice for personal profit.

I had seen The Third Man once before and thought I knew the story line.  I was unprepared for the revelation this film provided on second viewing.  Perhaps because I had some remembrance of what was going to happen next, I was able to focus my attention on the skill of Carol Reed in telling his story.  Lighting, camera angles, music, dialogue all come together perfectly in The Third Man, which, like a great novel, deserves a third and even fourth viewing.

677368,5,630347327X,"Unfortunately, ELP-recorded budget-label VHS tapes don't do proper justice to such a superb motion picture, thus this  product is NOT recommended.

Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears. Perhaps Welles was defining in this bit of philosophy his own status as Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN.

It's difficult to think of Harry as a star role, for the man is an unmitigated and unrepentant scoundrel who sold diluted penicillin to hospitals-- tampered-with medicine that caused the death or permanent disabling of dozens of children and adults. Even as Harry looks down from the height of a Ferris wheel at ant-sized people he expresses to friend Holly Martins (Cotten) his disdain and unconcern for humanity. Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the ""star"" of this Carol Reed picture? No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.

Original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war-scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding. Kudos to Alida Valli as a Czech refugee actress who fears deportation by the Russians. Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with. Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business-like military demeanor and well-masked concern. Minor characters like a so-called 'Baron' and other shady types keep Holly and us always on our toes.

This noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status. Highly recommended to all!

677370,5,630347327X,"Viewing ""The Third Man"" again brings back pleasant memories not only because it is a masterful movie, but because it helps to relive my personal experience in the Austrian capital. In 1954 I was stationed in Vienna with the U.S. military police company that included the International Patrol featured in the movie. Seeing the streets I knew so well was a treat. I saw the movie in 1949 and like many others was captivated by the Anton Karas's zither title theme and music from the movie.
 What makes this a classic motion picture?--the superb acting (particularly Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, and Alida Valli), the flashes of humor (witness the Wilfred Hyde-White scenes), the gripping black and white photography, the suspense, the chase sequences (especially the one with the little boy chasing and accusing the couple through the dark streets), the use of ominous shadows, the build-up of the mystery of the third person at the death scene, the use of Vienna as a major player, and the innovative zither sound track.
 Also: the great direction by Carol Reed surpassing Hitchcock's similar work, the love interest, the enormity of Harry Lime's crime in human terms, the little insights into characters (Baron Kurtz and Dr. Winkel were probably lovers), the police procedural component (the British military police), and Graham Greene's great script based upon his novel. Like other golden movies, it is able to draw you into its being so you get completely enveloped in it like a Venus fly trap. Great movies transport you into their world.
 Some footnotes: The movie has some eccentric characters as side effects. Reed focuses on little details that catch the viewer's attention like Lime's cat. The sleazy Casanova Club is part of the Viennese backdrop. Lime is a boy who ""never grew up."" Popescu says, ""Everybody ought to be careful in a city like this."" Lime hides in the shadows, and Cotton is unaware of it as he says, ""Come out, come out, whoever you are."" The giant ferris wheel in the Prader was a sight I had to see and ride for myself after having seen it in the movie. The chase in the sewers stays with you long after you have seen the movie.

677446,5,630347327X,"The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949)

Pauline Kael once said of Citizen Kane that it was the most fun you'd ever have watching a great film. I agree with the sentiment--I'm sure everyone has at least one movie they feel that way about--but for me, its recipient has always been Carol Reed's The Third Man, one of the many fine Graham Greene adaptations that's made its way to the screen (there are some authors whose work seems almost immune from being destroyed by bad adaptations, and Greene may well be one of them; of course, it helps that he adapted this one himself). No less an august body than the BFI called The Third Man the best British film ever produced. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I just checked my list of the hundred best movies ever made, and only three British films rank higher. (None of them, I'm sure, has ever been mentioned by the BFI in remotely the same breath as this movie; my tastes tend to diverge from the crowd somewhat. And for the record, they're Richard Eyre's Iris (#11), Alan Parker's Pink Floyd: The Wall (#33), and Harry Bromley Davenport's XTRO (#36). The Third Man sits at #38.)

Every film on my top 100 list is there for different reasons, but many of them share certain qualities. One of those is rewatchability; with very rare exceptions, it seems to me that one can't truly call a movie great if one can't imagine oneself watching it over and over again as time goes on, always deriving great pleasure from it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen The Third Man over the years; certainly more than a dozen, probably closer to twoscore. It's a movie that has everything; a fantastic script, wonderful acting, a director and cinematographer who were both at the tops of their respective games, wonderful scenery, and, perhaps most strikingly, a rare star turn from the early career of Orson Welles in a movie he didn't direct.

If you've somehow been in a cave for the past sixty years, here's a quick rundown of the plot: Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a hack writer, is summoned to Vienna, Austria, by his old school friend Harry Lime (Welles), who wants Martins to write some promotional materials for Lime's prescription drug business. Arriving there, however, he gets to Lime's apartment and finds out the man's just been killed in an auto accident. He manages to get to the funeral just in time, where he finds himself embroiled in a game of cat and mouse involving a couple of stiff-upper-lip British military police (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), Lime's beautiful girlfriend (Alida Valli), and two of Lime's shadier friends (Ernst Deutsch and Siegfried Breuer). Supposedly, the two friends were with Lime when he died, but the porter in Lime's building swears there was a third man helping to carry the body after the accident; who was the third man? And what if it wasn't an accident at all?

This is the kind of mystery that no one knows how to do any more (with the arguable exception of Hideo Nakata, whose Chaos borrows, visually, from The Third Man more than once). Reed unravels the mystery here just as much visually as he does through Martins' detective work. The viewer is expected to pay attention, to see the mystery rather than simply learning about it through the characters' conversations. What was the last Hollywood mystery you saw that did such a thing? Not that a great mystery can't be done conventionally; both The Maltese Falcon and The Usual Suspects come to mind as examples. But The Third Man is, as far as I can tell, unique in the way Reed unfolds the story; it's not enough that Graham Green wrote (and adapted) a cracking good mystery, and that the casting director staffed it with such phenomenal actors, each of whom turns in a stunning performance. It's Reed's visual language that takes this out of the realm of the good and into the realm of the spectacular. Everyone remembers Orson Welles' cuckoo clock speech, to be sure, but everyone also remembers the climactic scene with those fingers sticking out of the sewer grate; how many times have you seen it used in a movie since? It's become part of the language of film. Or Cotten standing at the base of the Ferris wheel? There's a reason is shows up in those best-movies-ever TV shows all the time; it's become iconic. But it's not just those scenes, of course. The entire movie is chock full of incredible images like this. Just rent it, put it on the DVD player, sit back, and enjoy the spectacle of the thing. And if you happen to get caught up in the engrossing story and wowed by the acting, well, that's just icing on the cake sometimes. Graham Greene could turn out a mystery like no other, and The Third Man began the golden age of Carol Reed's career (aside from collaborating once again with Greene on the other best Greene adaptation ever, Our Man in Havana, he was also responsible for such classics as Trapeze, Oliver!, and The Agony and the Ecstasy); there is almost nothing wrong with this movie at all. (The one thing that always nags me, however, is Harry Lime's first spoken lines; Welles always did have a tendency to go for the overly theatrical...) If you've never seen it, run, do not walk, to your nearest video rental store and pick a copy up. One of the hundred best films ever made. **** ",1238371200,2,5269,4.60702875399361

677449,5,630347327X,"This post responds to the review by Tuberacer (three stars) and some other commenters who have raised interesting criticisms of ""The Third Man.""

I disagree with those who have called this a ""perfect"" film, except to the extent that they mean its artistic satisfactions were perfect for them, which I can understand.  To say that it is a great film, howevever, it is not necessary to say that it is flawless.  Indeed, many great films have flaws, and a flawless film need not be great.  Greatness is, in part, the result of the scope of the artist's ambitions, and I believe Graham Greene's and Carol Reed's high ambitions were largely achieved.

First, regarding Tuberacer's problems with the plausibility of certain aspects of the film:  The partially lit sewers in the final scenes seems a little literalistic.  We have all seen scenes in other movies that take place in sewers or other subterranean urban locales, and they are always at least partially lit. Even subways have lights widely spaced in the tunnels as one can observe in many cities and many films. Whatever the actual facts regarding the Vienna sewers at the time in question, it seems reasonable to assume that sewers generally have some limited lighting in them to facilitate maintenance and repair, rather than being totally dark. The partial lighting in the Vienna sewer scenes show the existence of stairs, catwalks, valve wheels, pipes, and other features that would be difficult to negotiate and hard to find in total darkness, even with handheld lights. That the tunnels in the scenes are dim is illustrated by the command of a pursuing police captain, who, upon hearing a noise from a side tunnel, shouts to a subordinate ""Licht!"" thereby illuminating the fleeing Lime. Tuberacer's response to others' comments about the possibility of brief glimpses in the darkness as flashlights, matches, etc. are lit, is interesting. In my view, however, the imagery of the confused maze of dim or dark subterranean tunnels, suffused with stench as Callaway remarks, through which the characters chase, better captures the moral maze Lime creates for Holly, Anna, Callaway, and even himself: ducking into the sewers enabled him to elude Martins in an earlier scene, but in the end, he can only stretch his fingers through the grating to the air of the world above ground.

As for Callaway's failure to check on the identity of the dead man, which Tuberacer also notes, it raises a question.  It is not clear, however, when the British occupying authorities, as opposed to, say, the local police, became aware of the death -- whether it was before or after the burial that Martins attends. In the chaos of a divided city, occupied by the military of four nations, it seems less farfetched that the dead man could have been interred before the foreign authorities became aware of it. In any event, Callaway apparently had no reason to believe that the dead man was anyone other then Lime before Martins raised doubts.  In fact, the substituted dead man, Harbin, appears in a photo during Major Callaway's ""magic lantern show"" and somewhat resembles Welles as Lime, so the descriptions of Lime and the dead man were likely to have matched.

Of course, there are other questions. For example, why did Lime follow Martins to Anna's apartment and allow himself to be discovered, only to run away? Certainly, he had learned through the Baron and Dr. Winkle that Martins was asking questions, and may have wanted to see what Martins was up to. He was hiding, but was given away by the cat. I think a lot of these questions point to the film's view that these are flawed humans with painfully uncertain motives stabbing around in a dangerous, deceptive, and devastated environment.

Second, the thematic issues.  That the main characters are, largely, badly deluded people, as Tuberacer and others observe, is precisely the point. Lime's exhibits the grandiosity of the narcissist in his ""cuckoo clock"" speech, but the meta-point that the film makes is that such evil, grand or tawdry, is an inevitable part of the history of man in the world. Martins is intentionally drawn as naive, hence his occupation and ""silly"" name. I think Tuberacer is being unfair to Anna Schmidt, however, who, at one point responds to Martins's discoveries about Lime by saying (I'm going from memory as it's been a few years since I last saw the film) ""A person doesn't change because you learn more about him. Harry wasn't just my lover and your friend -- he was Harry.""

Tuberacer states both that Lime is ""this smart looking guy"" but also says he is ""the most pathetic guy in Vienna."" I think that gets at something. Many of the reviewers note the themes of truth and justice vs. love, friendship, and loyalty, and there are those, but Greene's work is never far from basic questions of good and evil, and Reed doubles down on that theme by packaging Lime's moral depravity in the person of Welles. We have no trouble spotting the seamy evil of the unctuous Baron Kurtz, the weaselly Dr. Winkel, or the brutal Mr. Popescu (I disagree with Tuberacer that Popescu is shrewd -- he is the muscle end of the conspiracy, of which Lime, as Callaway makes clear, is the leader and brains, and the ""rewrite"" was by Greene himself, not Reed). But when the light in the opposite building goes on, illuminating the street and revealing Welles in the doorway beneath Anna's apartment -- in what Martin Scorcese has called one of the most thrilling moments in film -- we are no more prepared to believe that Lime is responsible for the crimes Callaway has described than are Martins and Anna. With only about 15 minutes of screen time, in only ten of which he has any significant dialogue -- a borderline cameo as Tuberacer says -- Welles steals the show because of the dissonance between what we have been told of Lime and what we see: Welles, with all his dazzling charisma, charm, wit, good looks, and ironic smile. I can't think of another actor who could have carried off the role, retaining his pull on us even as the worst is revealed. Without Welles, the film fails. Indeed, it takes Callaway's ""magic lantern show"" to convince Martins, and us, that this irresistible character is a moral monster. Lime is a ""charmer"" in both senses of the word --a charismatic wit and a seducer, a deceiver -- he seduced Martins figuratively, and Anna literally, but he seduces both of them, and the audience, emotionally. In response to Martins's unsuccessful attempt to befriend her cat, Anna remarks ""He only liked Harry,"" and the cat's attraction to Lime, as shown in the scene when Lime is first revealed in the doorway, reflects Lime's corresponding characteristics -- an amoral creature, he has no real connection with anyone. On the Ferris wheel, those moving below are ""dots"" whose only value to Lime are twenty thousand pounds each if they ""stopped moving forever."" Martins tells Callaway he met Lime ""back in school. I was never so lonesome in my life until he showed up."" Martins calls Lime the ""best friend I ever had,"" yet says in the same breath that he hadn't seen him since 1939 and only ""occasionally"" before that. At one point, Martins makes a Freudian slip, saying to Callaway, ""I guess nobody really knew Harry like he did ... like I did."" Lime radiates bonhomie and captures others by warming them with his counterfeit intimacy and enthusiasm. Martins says to Callaway ""We never did much. He just made things . . . fun.""

During the Ferris wheel ride, Lime attempts to manipulate Martins, attempting one then another of a repertoire of gambits -- appeals to friendship and ""old times,"" appeals for sympathy, thinly veiled threats, joviality -- attempting to bring Martins around. At the end of their meeting at the Ferris wheel, Lime even has ready a facile historical comparison with which to further confuse Martins. To Tuberacer: Of course it's a false analogy. In modern jargon, Lime is a sociopath, of the type to which the weak, the lonely, the naive, the self-pitying, and the poorly grounded give their souls, just as had been shown yet again in the then all-too-recent war. Lime's comparison of himself with the Borgias is transparent nonsense -- it's Lime's own delusion -- but it is the type of sleight of hand that, in combination with his indefatiguable good spirits and boyish enthusiasm, has always carried all before it for Harry, and by which he has always been able to keep the loyalty of those he needed. Tuberacer asks:  Why is ""this smart-looking guy"" even in Vienna? For the same reason a vulture finds a carcass.

By the end of the film no one has come through looking good, except perhaps the childlike Paine, Callaway's aide, who is killed by Lime. Even Callaway turns over Anna's false passport to his Soviet counterpart a little too indifferently for my taste, knowing what her fate will be. The war, in which good triumphed over evil, has, nonetheless, inured everyone to evil, especially in so attractive a form as Lime. Everyone remains as deluded as they were at the beginning.  As Martins says in the first line of the opening voice-over, ""I never knew the Vienna of the Strauss waltzes."" Yes, it is indeed gone.

Another reviewer said he wished that Martins and Anna had gotten together at the end. But, that long, achingly sad, final shot, after the second, real, burial of Lime -- when Martins gets out of Callaway's jeep and waits for Anna, who, walking down the cold, bleak road lined with pollarded trees, passes him (and the camera) without a glance -- reinforces the thematic tensions of the film: Having been compromised in loyally defending Lime, Martins is no less compromised in having betrayed him, even despite having ultimately accepted the responsibility of eliminating Lime himself in a kind of coup de grace. Moreover, Martins's acquired ""virtue"" in betraying Lime does not win him Anna. How could it? Martins's inadequacies are unchanged for her -- whatever Lime was, her life is empty without him. Friendship and loyalty may require the ballast of a shared morality. Love need not be so bound.

Furthermore, Tuberacer: Yes, the film is funny, as well as serious, as well as tragic. Greene and Reed cross the tightrope of morality balancing sadness, pain, and loss with comedy, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes farcical. The comedy generally comes at Martins's expense -- having a literary fan in Paine, being mistaken for a serious writer by Mr. Crabbin, the Cultural Reeducation Society promoter -- undercutting his over-earnest posturing. Just as the dim illumination of the sewer actually heightens its darkness and imprenetrable menace, the comedic elements of the film heighten the sorrow, as when Anna laughs at a memory of Lime, but then deflects Martins's advice that she ought to laugh more often with the response, ""There isn't enough for two laughs.""

As for the zither, which many reviewers found intrusive or distracting: I think it adds to the film in a way that may be unique in films. It has a presence and a sound that suffuses the film with an old-world exoticism. The sound is like something we have never heard before that yet conveys something familiar, as if a piece of music perfectly captured the feel of the street upon which one lived as a child. The principal theme music itself is adaptive to the film, with a strolling initial theme, a insistive, percussive second part, and a lyrical third section. The zither's ""fills"" at various dramatic points are like some unearthly Greek chorus. In any event, it's not ""background"" music -- it adds an effect and I like it for that.

""The Third Man"" is not a great film because it's everyone's cup of tea. It is idle to compare it to ""The Big Sleep,"" as Tuberacer does. There is no Philip Marlowe whose viewpoint (and voice-over) help to channel our understanding and reactions. There is no ""hero"" to pull for. As Lime tells Martins, ""Oh, Holly, you and I aren't heroes. The world doesn't make any heroes outside of your stories."" The film's protagonist is feckless and maudlin, the heroine is desolate and inconsolable, and the villain is fascinating and dynamic. There is no hope for any of them. No one ""prevails."" The ""case"" isn't ""solved."" In drawing upon the film, one is left to one's own orientation and bearings in a moral spacewalk. It is a great film because, from the struggles of a handful of obscure people in a ruined city in the wake of war, it presents a rueful view of the sorrows, contradictions, and tragedy of human struggles and obligations. As Calloway tells Martins, ""Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.""",1235001600,7,12632,4.841130152848541
677450,5,630347327X,"The Third Man is one of those reputed classics of cinema that I'd always wanted to watch, and when I saw that it had been released on blu-ray, I decided that this was the time.  Really, it was an experiment - not only did I want to see it for the first time, but I was most interested on the effect the blu-ray transfer would have on a black and white film.  The success or failure of ""The Third Man"" on this technology would go a long way toward convincing me whether the effort should be applied to other classics, and whether or not it would be worth my time to buy or rent them if I already owned them on conventional DVDs.

I wanted to say a quick word about the 'feel' of film on the new high resolution televisions and blu-ray players.  I adjusted to the 'soap opera look' (where filmed material almost has the look of something shot on video) very quickly, and, even though I thought that it would be distracting and that I wouldn't like it, I've since changed my mind and have come to enjoy the crispness and the clarity.  But for a film like 'The Third Man', or other classics that someone may have watched over and over, the effect may be as jarring as when cd's finally killed off LP's.  Back then, the hiss of the needle on the record seemed like another section of the orchestra, and it actually took me a while to get used to the clean sounds of the cd.

Before I come off as a complete old fogey, or as a audio snob, I'll say that I also quickly adjusted to cd's, and judging from current sales of records, I assume everyone else did too.  And so may be the case with blu-ray.  Of course, if the new look is too bothersome, one can always adjust the player and television to playback the film in a more familiar aspect, but then what would be the point of putting it (or buying it) in the blu-ray format to begin with?

These were some of the questions I was asking myself when I sat down to watch Carol Reed's postwar noir thriller about black marketeers and political tension in the Austrian capital of Vienna.  The film begins with a short narration about the state of the city, and how it is quartered into zones of control by the English, French, Russians, and Americans.  In and among this police state, the black market is thriving, and can be murderous.  Into this tautly strung situation comes a rather ignorant and naive American writer of horse operas named Holly Martin (Joeseph Cotton), who came at the request of his friend Harry Lime.  No more than a few hours after arriving in Vienna, though, Martin discovers that Lime has been struck by a car and is dead.  This launches Martin into an investigation that takes him into the shadowy streets of Vienna, and under the spell unintentionally cast by Lime's czech lover, Anna.  Martin continues to search Vienna for the trail of his friend and for a way to clear Lime's name, after a captain in the British zone tells Martin that Lime was involved in a deadly scheme involving black market penicillin.

There are several things that elevate this movie into a classic status, but none probably so much as the scarred and rubble strewn city of Vienna itself.  Black and white film may have found its perfect accomplice in the interplay of light and shadow along its cobblestone streets, which in turn highlight the depths of characters as they dogde and dart and keep their true motivations to themselves for most of the film.  This is one of the most mature films from the 40's that I've ever seen - one of the staples from that time was at least a few moments of comic relief, or else the villians have themselves almost become cartoony.  'The Third Man' isn't flawless in this respect, but it comes close.  (I also felt a striking similarity between the British police in 'The Third Man', and the authorities in Terry Gilliam's masterpiece 'Brazil'.  They both give me the feeling I could be good friends with the authoritarian arms of a British police state, and in the end feel a little sorry for all the trouble I'd be causing them as they put me in prison and tortured me.)

'The Third Man' deserves its classic status, if for nothing more than its cinematography (and definitely not for the zither music on the soundtrack.  What a strange and distracting decision).  The questions in my mind about the transfer disappeared the first time I saw Joeseph Cotton clattering his way over the cobblestone streets, and the gigantic shadows thrown against the buildings of the city.  Though this film didn't originate the noir genre, it certainly capitalized on all its aspects, but the one question I still can't answer is if that alone would be worth the cost to purchase this film in blu-ray if I had already owned the last re-issue on a conventional DVD.

From my experiences so far, a good upconversion of a DVD on a quality system rivals (but doesn't equal) the blu-ray picture.  I haven't seen this particular film on conventional discs, so I cannot make a direct comparison, though as more and more films are transferred into blu-ray I'll eventually get the chance to put some of them head-to-head.  After doing a little research, I found that this edition of 'The Third Man' doesn't contain any other features than what was included in the 2007 DVD release, so the exclusive reason for this edition is the blu-ray technology.

Is that enough to justify another purchase?  I suppose that depends on where this movie ranks in one's personal best films list.  If I were buying for the first time, then yes, I would definitely go with blu-ray - the cost is not that prohibitive.  If I had just bought the last release...well, that's another story.  I will say that the blu-ray transfer might be a good reason to break down and buy some classics that I'd not considered owning before.

I did not have a large library of films when VHS was replaced by DVD, so I haven't had to go through the experience of replacing a collection yet.  And the older I get, the less likely I am to start now.  Though the 'The Third Man' isn't one of them, I can see repurchasing some stellar (in my opinion) films in blu-ray, and if 'The Third Man' is one of your stellar films, then I'd certainly recommend it in blu-ray for your collection.  For me, though, I was happy to rent this version of an extremely enjoyable film",1234656000,7,6285,4.5048458149779735
677451,2,630347327X,I was extremely disappointed by the blu-ray edition of The Third Man. The digital transfer is exceedingly poor and the image looks very grainy. The movie is as thrilling as always but the image leaves a lot to be desired.,1233792000,2,221,4.55
677452,5,630347327X,"Among the films I allow people to wake me up for at all hours, The Third Man certainly belongs. It is one of those movies that I've seen dozens of time and every time I was in awe of the beauty of it in every way. I think I was about 16 years old when I saw it first and immediately fell like a ton of bricks for Alida Valli, so I very much empathized with Joseph Cotten and the dilemmas he has to face on his way.

There are so many marvelous facets to this diamond, that it's hard where to begin.
Ok, let's start with the story. Graham Green wrote the original story and collaborated on the movie script as well, together with legendary Alexander Korda and rumor has it that even Welles himself had his input.
The story is set not long after what the Germans called ""Stunde Null"" (transl. ""Hour of Zero""), predictably called thus after their surrender in WWII when every major city was pretty much rubble. This is also true for its ally Austria, more particularly its capital Vienna, where the events of this movie take place and which faces pretty much the same issues as its 'sister city' Berlin: It's carved up in zones between the allied forces, riddled with black market activity, still pretty much in ruins, (and as the movie was made in 1949 no sets were needed for that aspect) and with a lot of refugees coming and going.

In this city Holly Martins arrives, a writer of westerns of somewhat doubtful talent, who wants to visit his old childhood friend Harry Lime. Unfortunately his visit is merely just in time to attend his friend's funeral, who apparently got killed in an accident being hit by a car while crossing the street. Two of his friends that happened to pass that very moment carried him off to the sidewalk but he was already dead.

At the funeral Martins for the first time can feast his eyes on Anna Schmidt, Harry's girlfriend and before long he falls head over heels in love with her, but Anna is in mourning over Harry's death and little concerned for the affairs of the living, especially affairs of the heart, even though she befriends Martins.

Talking to the caretaker who saw Harry's accident happen, Martins becomes convinced that aside from Harry's two friends there must have been a third man involved who helped carry the body to the curb. Testimonies during subsequent visits of the two known friends bring to the surface even more inconsistencies in their versions of what happened and Martins decides to get to the bottom of the matter to find out what happened to Harry.

Soon Martins is approached by the British zone police who think Harry's death was staged to cover up his black market activities which include selling fake penicillin. Martins understandably is shocked and at first refuses to believe, but is soon convinced by the evidence presented to him.

Meanwhile Anna Schmidt has been found out as a refugee who should be deported by the Russians and naturally British zone police use this as leverage on Martins, as they see how much he cares for her, and suggest a trade. Martins accepts with tragic consequences for all involved.

There are so many images from this movie burned into my retinas that at this point I hardly need to actually play the movie to experience it all over again. To name some of these images:
- Harry Lime's funeral
- Scene at the ferris wheel
- The balloon man and the cat
- The sewer scenes
- Scenes between Holly Martins and Anna

The function of the music I probably don't need to explain as the zither music became so immortal as it accompanies the drama like one long opera act guiding the viewer through emotional highs and lows.

The use of the camera and lighting is incredibly beautiful and one of the most magnificent examples of black-white photography, supreme film noir splendor.

The use of sound, not just music but especially combined with the visual magnificently used, especially in the sewer scenes where a police hunt closes in on a criminal both visually as well as through sound.

The acting is phenomenal of the entire cast, especially the main trio Welles, Cotten and Alida Valli.

677454,2,630347327X,"This is a review of Criterion's blu-ray edition of this great British film, not of the film itself.  This blu-ray release is significant because it is Criterion's first blu-ray of an old B&W classic, one of hundreds in the Criterion Collection catalog. The immediate question is whether blu-ray will make the same difference with old films as it does with films made in the more recent past.

Criterion's regular DVD release of The Third Man was in 1999, and included their usual high level of restoration.  In it's day, that DVD was state of the art, and it brought the film back to life.  Home video has progressed quite a bit in the past decade, especially with the advent of blu-ray's. There are now hundred's of Criterion DVD's that might be re-released if blu-ray truly makes a difference with old films.  So does it?

The short answer is no, or at least, not yet.  I watched the current blu-ray edition and then watched the 1999 DVD through my PS3, which upscales regular DVD to pseudo hi-def.  I watched them on a big screen 1080p projection system, which brings out any flaws in regular DVDs and makes most blu-rays really shine.  The blu-ray edition of this film had stronger detail, of course, and had nice rich tones, with many different levels of grays and black.  There was much wider contrast in the blu-ray, without the mushy low-contrast often seen in old B&W films, especially those without studio lighting.  But the bad news is grain.  The grain is just terrible with low detail neutral gray tones, which basically means close-ups of faces.  While those high-contrast night-time exterior shots look quite good, the graininess in the close-ups is distracting and effectively kills any illusion of being hi-def.  The problem is not the transfer, but the film itself; apparently the film technology of 1949 just can't reach what blu-ray is designed for. The grain issue is not near as bad in the DVD, although the DVD does not have the wide tonal range of the blu-ray.  The difference in clarity between DVD and blu-ray is not dramatic, but I preferred the DVD to avoid the grainy close-ups.  That might not be a problem on smaller screen TV's, but with a bigger screen, the overall visual quality of the blu-ray is disappointing.  I would say that there is no need to upgrade the DVDs of all of those old B&W films, at least until someone perfects a grain filter.",1232236800,31,2380,4.7101449275362315

Marred by the incongruously-jaunty zither music (though many like it) and the fact that the movie only really takes off when Orson Welles comes on scene, The Third Man is an incredily atmospheric and moody mystery that may be a bit flawed but is well-worth watching.",1230940800,,284,4.795918367346939
677567,4,630347327X,"It's heartening to see that more and more classic films are being released in the Blu-ray format, which offers a crisp, sharp, High Definition picture and greater clarity of sound.  The latest is ""The Third Man,""  the 1949 film about post-World War II intrigue set in a Vienna divided into French, American, British, and Russian zones, each containing its share of suspicious characters.

 Alcoholic pulp Western author Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) has come to Vienna at the invitation of his friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), who has offered him a job, but Holly arrives just as Lime is being buried.  The film is based on the question, ""Who killed Harry Lime?""  We hear contrasting opinions of Lime.  A British officer, Calloway (Trevor Howard), states unequivocally that Lime was a black market profiteer and deserves to be dead.  Lime's girlfriend (Alida Valli) tells Holly that Lime is not the man Calloway has described and sets out to clear his name.

 ""The Third Man"" was made by a team who experienced firsthand the war-torn devastation of Europe.  Director Carol Reed worked for the British Army's wartime documentary unit and writer Graham Greene not only wrote about spies but sometimes was one.  Reed filmed entirely on location in a Vienna still strewn with rubble and bomb craters four years after the war ended.

 One of the film's most memorable features is its all-zither score by the Austrian Anton Karas.  In fact, ""The Third Man Theme"" became one of the biggest hits of 1950.  The music is certainly unique in the annals of film scoring and gives the film both an upbeat feel and an old world quality.  In addition, the movie features a beautifully staged chase sequence that leads to the city's sewer system.  The photography by Robert Krasker in this sequence is especially impressive, as long shots with bright light sources just out of sight throw elongated, distorted shadows, a characteristic of film noir.

 The Blu-ray edition contains a restored high-definition digital transfer; a video introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich; two audio commentaries; a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film; ""Graham Greene: The Hunted Man,"" a 1968 episode of the BBC's ""Omnibus"" series; a 1951 episode of the radio series ""The Lives of Harry Lime"" written and performed by Orson Welles; archival footage of postwar Vienna; and a booklet featuring an essay on the movie and its impact.",1230422400,6,2422,5.0376884422110555

677570,5,630347327X,"When compiling lists of the 10 greatest films ever made Carol Reed's THE THIRD MAN is often overlooked, maybe because when we think of great directors, Reed's name doesn't spring to mind. He is certainly not an auteur, let alone in the same class as Orson Welles who has a key supporting role in this film. Nevertheless, THE THIRD MAN is a masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of all time. I would say it's just about a perfect film.

Pulp fiction writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) comes to post war Vienna at the behest of his childhood friend Harry Lime (Welles) only to discover that Harry has been run over by a truck, and is dead. Or is he? What follows is a tangled mystery that Martins tries to unravel, with or without the help of the authorities, Harry's friends and cohorts, and Harry's lover (Alida Valli) whom he falls in love with.

The plot construction is bold and ingenious, and the dialogue memorable thanks in large part to Grahame Greene's exquisite screenplay. I just loved the way the 2 cemetery scenes with Valli framed the action. There is also the fantastic b&w cinematography with it's expressionistic and surrealistic touches, great acting by everyone, especially Cotton (his best role), Valli, Welles, and Trevor Howard, great editing which includes documentary footage in the narrated opening sequences, and a unique score in which the orchestra is replaced by a single instrument, the zither, expertly played by Anton Karas.

677573,5,630347327X,"Film buffs have a reason to celebrate.

 Carol Reed's ""THE THIRD MAN,"" perhaps the most highly-regarded film in world cinema is now available in a jaw-dropping Blu-ray transfer.

This wondrous movie has never looked better and it is hard to imagine anything more that could possible be done to improve the image quality.  It looks like a first viewing directly from the lab.  I doubt Carol Reed ever saw it in such a pristine condition!  The blacks are velvety and the grays and whites shimmer with a silvery sheen.  And the retro mono sound is sharp. This ultimate edition deserves a special place in the digital library.

The plot is minimal.  American pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) travels to post WW II Vienna to see his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles).  But instead ends up investigating the apparent death of the black market operator in a city of fractured, shadowy loyalties.  It is a tale that, on the surface, is about love, deception and murder.  The dark trinity of great noir mysteries.

But it is not so much the plot that makes this remarkable film so highly-regarded but rather the extraordinary sense of time and place.  Graham Greene's acerbic dialogue seduces and cuts.  There's the brilliant black and white photography by Robert Krasker -- often slight askew and reminiscent of German expressionism.  And the audacious zither score by Anton Karas perfectly frames the mood and atmosphere of this unforgettable film that somehow burns itself into one's own experience.

If the story is secondary, what is this film really ""about""?  Perhaps it is about being lost in a fractured landscape where old ideals and values have evaporated.  Where meaning is ephemeral.  It is a post-modern amorality tale awash in the frisson of deception and cynicism of the time. The war's over -- now what?  How do we know what's real and true and good?  But whatever existential metaphors are embedded in the film, it is a hypnotically compelling exercise that is much more than the sum of it's masterful parts.  Unquestionably a great film as well as art.  A rare achievement indeed.

This hi-def disc is a  transfer identical in content to the previous, restored, two-disc edition.

It's my understanding that Criterion is release all their Blu-Ray discs in standard DVD cases in order to blend them in with all their previous DVD releases.  I think this is a big mistake.  Why didn't they release the DVDs in Laserdisc sleeves?  I want to be able to distinguish my Blu-Rays from my DVDs.  Any thoughts?,1222300800,11,392,4.450704225352113
677628,5,630347327X,"What happened to Harry Lime? Who is the third man? These are just two of the questions Holly Martin wants answers to in post-WWII Vienna. Martin arrives to find Harry Lime, his long time friend, isn't there to meet him. He goes to Lime's apartment and is shocked when he discovers what happened. Then we are taken on an exploration of this city and important questions begin to rise: is justice possible here and what is its nature?

The Third Man, in its beautiful black and white depicts a city occupied by ally forces, shaken by war, and architecturally disheveled. Camera angles from balcony windows, ancient sewer systems, the lighting on cobble stone streets, and the twisted frames bringing into focus medieval steeples, winding broken staircases, and citizens fraught with paranoia and fear--all add to a composition of unique quality, texture and magnificent vision.

An important highlight is Orson Welles' role. Welles is a master of character acting to the point you can feel his conflict. His monologue after the ferris wheel ride is simply magnificent. You can feel Martin's conflict too, as he decides between the truth and friendship, justice or loyalty, during the tension ridden final moments of the film!

As the film progresses the characters cement a representation of different ideas: The English soldier, Callaway, is a realist, Anna is a fatalist, and Holly Martin, the American, is fittingly the idealist, who almost naively believes in a higher sense of justice that can only be obtained by taking things into his own hands. This film is beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, and memorable for its tension, conflicts, philosophy, and enduring plot that holds up against anything contemporary Hollywood can put out today. This is a true classic and pillar of cinematic vision.",1221782400,,1800,5.115646258503402

Most are unavailable anywhere with Criterion consistently setting the release standards for DVDs,and this film is no exception.
""The Third Man"" is a film originally released in /49 in Britain to great acclaim(this is the film we see),then released a year later in the U.S.The latter market had about 11 minutes cut out of it and the opening narrative changed from director Carol Reed's voice to star Joseph Cottons'.
This two disc collection includes everything you ever wanted to know about this film,and so much more. Included is a nine minute vignette with a self explanatory title ""Insiders' Info"" ,the US Trailer,the UK Press Book,another small vignette translating the foreign language sequences into English with sub-titles(five min.),a /51 radio show starring Orson Welles as ""Harry Lime"" in ""Ticket to Tangiers"",a Lux Radio Theatre show from /51 of ""The Third Man"",an award winning documentary from 2000 called""Who was the Third Man?""(30 min),a /68 profile of Graham Greene from the BBC show ""Omnibus"",a three min./54 newsreel of zither player Anton Karas at London's Empress Club,another three min.

To top this all off is a 26  page booklet with several articles about the making and producing of the film which are quite intriguing,along with production credits,transfer specs,cast credits and much more.
I won't go into the plot as it is very well known by most by now. I must say that I have never seen the film looking as good as it does in this release. They made a great transfer using a high grain positive master and took out thousands of extant marks,dirt,etc, to bring the B&W print gloriously back to life. It's not perfect but it is light years beyond anything I've ever seen before. I've always said that a great print can only add to ones enjoyment of a film and the proof is abundantly clear in this ""pudding"".
The film comes from the ""Janus"" collection which,as I noted in my review of Criterions'glorious release of ""Pandora's Box"",has been known to me as a firm that has released only countless cut and butchered films over the years. However,as I have nothing to compare films with(as I did with Pandora)I can only say that nothing appears to be amiss here so I will leave it at that.
In conclusion this is a film which belongs in every serious film collectors collection. A classic of its' genre,""The Third Man"" is without doubt a very important film. Its' cast is rock solid,the script and on film atmosphere that is created through its' brilliant use of lighting and cinematography,serves to enhance the films' quality and stature.

677630,5,630347327X,"""I never knew the Vienna before the war""....

Thus begins one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest film characters ever created in the charismatic and brilliantly dangerous Harry Lime. Who created him has been argued about for years. Welles was always diplomatic and gave credit to Carol Reed, but anyone who has ever seen this film knows better. Fans of Orson Welles can easily discern his fingerprints everywhere.

He brings the enigmatic Lime to life, his genius hanging over every frame of this wonderful Carol Reed production. Joseph Cotten, a friend and staple in a lot of his films, is on hand as pulp western writer Holly Martins. When Cotten comes to postwar Vienna it is an uncoordinated international mess, the black market thriving in the chaos. When Martins discovers his old friend Harry Lime is dead this film really begins.

Alida Valli is the strikingly beautiful actress Cotten falls for, but has no chance with because she's in love with his old friend Harry. But Harry might not be so dead after all, at least not according to Trevor Howard, the detective hot on Harry's heels for racketeering. Cotten is having none of it and sets out to clear his friend's name. What follows is the most stylishly filmed noir in film history.

The stark black and white photography and the off-kilter camera angles serve to highlight a postwar world where things are not quite right. From the moment Welles steps out of the shadows into the streets of Vienna we are mesmerized. Harry Lime is almost amused by the chase and the proceedings. The scene on a ferris wheel between Martins and Harry, who may not be the same man he knew, is unforgettable, as is Lime's views of the Swiss!

If you haven't seen this film, you've been missing one of the five best films ever made. Whenever I think of Welles, this is what I think of. His Harry Lime is unforgettable. Welles would later portray the same character on a weekly radio show. When Martins discovers what Harry has been up to he must make a decision that will change his chances with Valli, and could cost him a lot more.

Anton Karas' zither theme helps set the off-center mood for this film and is justly famous. It is not something that would work independent of the film but is a perfect match for what is happening onscreen. All the extra goodies on this Blu-Ray Criterion edition are listed in the product description. The most fabulous of these, for radio lovers at least, is Welles' portrayal of Harry Lime in one of the finest from that radio series.

Every single part of this film works within the atmospheric framework to create a dark and exciting jigsaw puzzle you'll never forget. A true screen classic.",1220227200,12,2694,4.670886075949367

677633,5,630347327X,"Graham Greene is one of the most acclaimed authors of the 20th century, and, unlike many such literary talents, he recognized the merits of film, and took work as a screenwriter for the British film industry, including several collaborations with producer/director Carol Reed, of which ""The Third Man"" is the most famous.  Greene's works tend to be divided into two main genres: his meditations on Catholicism in the modern world (""The Power and the Glory"", for example) and his work in the spy and crime genres, the category to which ""The Third Man"" belongs.  It is also the high-watermark for director/producer Reed, though he would only earn his Best Director Oscar some two decades later with the musical ""Oliver!""  ""The Third Man"" is one of the great achievements in film noir, and, perhaps, in film in general.

Greene's path in researching the film is in many ways mirrored by the character he ended up creating, one Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten, a prolific actor of the era who never reached the level of recognition of Stewart, Grant, or Bogart); arriving in Vienna, Greene prowled the bombed-out streets and drank in the Casanova Club, talking with local officials.  He was inspired by stories of postwar shortage, organized smuggling, and the interaction of the four great powers in the early days of the Cold War.  Martins arrives, having been summoned by his prewar friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles, in what is, apart from Charles Foster Kane, his most famous role), only to find on arrival that Lime has been mysteriously killed in a car accident.  The local British security chief, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) insinuates that Harry was a notorious racketeer involved in everything up to and including murder, and Martins, a writer of pulp novelettes about gunslingers, refuses to let that explanation stand.  He delves deeper into Harry's world, from acquaintances such as Baron Kurtz (Ernst Deutch, who couldn't appear less trustworthy if he tried) and Dr. Winkle (Erich Ponto), who were both present at his death, and, most importantly, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech living in Austria on a forged passport provided by Lime to help her avoid repatriation to Soviet-held territory.  Martins' first big lead?  Witness reports that an unidentified third man was present at Lime's death.

""The Third Man""'s plot suffers from a case of what TV Tropes would call a 'Rosebud': the fact that the main plot twist is common knowledge because of the movie's notoriety (and, like the original Rosebud, Orson Welles is involved).  We all know that Harry Lime isn't actually dead because he is due to appear and give him famous speech about cuckoo clocks (though Welles is listed in the opening credits, so perhaps it was never that big a secret).  However, there is still plenty in the movie for the viewer to be surprised about, just as ""Citizen Kane"" retains its lustre.

The movie has several great performances, starting with Cotten as the 'very American' (in the worlds of Peter Bogdanovich) lead man, Alida Valli as Anna, Trevor Howard as Calloway, and an enjoyable comic turn from Bernard Lee (later M to the Connery, Lazenby, and Moore incarnations of James Bond) as Calloway's batman, a sergeant who is quite a fan of Holly's writing.  The performance that everyone always ends up talking about is Welles, however, in what amounts to an extended cameo (two scenes, the second with basically no dialogue).

The other notable production components include the music, provided by Anton Karas on his zither string instrument, who was hired on the spur of the moment after impressing the director at a wartime party, and it was an inspired choice, though it may jar some people expecting more traditional noir stuff.  The film is filmed in the actual postwar Vienna, still a place of ruined buildings, providing for a very high level of verisimilitude.

Criterion's DVD version provides an extensive selection of extras, including several commentaries, features on the film's production, and, best of all, several older segments that include an interview with Greene on his career, and some old newsreels spotlighting the Vienna of the period, and showing the level of detail that Reed and company were able to capture.",1214697600,3,4234,5.024285714285714
677634,5,630347327X,"Carol Reed's The Third Man is his best known film, it was ground-breaking for many reasons, and it is one of the finest and most influential of all Film Noir classics. One of its hallmarks is the exceptional camera work by cinematographer Robert Krasker, for which he won an Oscar. The lighting and angles he used cannot be forgotten. But equally memorable is the music by zither artist Anton Karas, for which he was nominated. It is one of the very few films in which a single instrument carries the entire score.

The story and screenplay by Graham Greene form the foundation for this post WWII thriller set in Vienna about the missing friend (Orson Welles) of an American western novelist (Joseph Cotten). Alida Valli portrays beautifully Welles' illegal actress-girlfriend, and Trevor Howard is the Rock of Gibraltar as the British sergeant responsible for solving the mystery of Welles' disappearance. Old Vienna is wrapped in mystery and fog, full of suspicious people and suspenseful moments. The final chase through the sewers is among the most classic scenes in all of cinema.

Even though Reed did not receive the Oscar for Best Director for his masterpiece, he did win the Cannes Film Grand Prix, and proved his genius as a director. (Welles was not above taking some credit for the success on the basis of association.) Before this, Reed had directed Odd Man Out (1947) starring James Mason, and The Fallen Idol (1948) - another Graham Greene story and script - with Ralph Richardson. After this, he directed Trapeze (1956) with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, and Our Man In Havana (1959) with Alec Guinness and Maureen O'Hara - again, a Graham Greene story and script. Even though The Agony And The Ecstasy (1965) with Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison was a well crafted film based on a Philip Dunne script, it was a box office flop. Only Reed's final film, Oliver! (1968), would again attract the public, and Oscar - this time with eleven nominations, taking home five including Best Picture and Best Director.

677635,5,630347327X,"There are moments of absolute brilliance in this extraordinary morality play that explores the tension between loyalty to friends, self interest, and loyalty to the overarching moral code imposed by the social contract.  The dialogue between Wells and Cotten in the ferris wheel poses the moral dilemma quite vividly (do you really care about those little dots moving along the ground below?). Also there is a great deal of suspense during this scene as to what Wells will do.  One of the great scenes in the history of film.

The girl friend adopts a simpler code of absolute fealty to friendship (at the expense of society's code).  This option is compellingly portrayed and cannot be rejected out of hand.

Greene's book has a far happier end, and I prefer it to the film's ending.  In fact, I think the girl should get together with Cotten at the end -- it is not an unrealistic Hollywood ending, is more upbeat given the moral stance of the story, and is consistent with the moral code of the girl that love conquers all.  Director Carol Reed seems to have felt that the we need a downer ending here to preserve the gravitas of the film, but I think he was just wrong on that score. It's not a nihilistic film and is a morality affirming film -- so why not have Cotten and the girl get together at the end?

Cotten is perhaps the most underrated actor on the century.  His work is truly great.  And Wells is perfect in his portrayal of Harry Lime. He has a way of smirking that portrays Lime's moral stance as well as anything can.

The chase scene in the sewers of Vienna is also pure genius.

On the other hand, the story unfolds far too slowly.  In fact, it's hard to sit through the first third of the movie without the advance knowledge that this is truly one of the greatest films ever made.",1213315200,,1802,4.4573170731707314
677698,5,630347327X,"When I first saw `Citizen Kane' I was completely smitten with Orson Welles and his brilliant performance.  I had always heard wonderful things about Welles, but I had never really gotten around to delving into his filmography.  The other night I picked up this classic film for the mere fact that Welles was in it, and what I found was one of the tightest film noirs I've ever seen; a film that I'm sure will steadily climb my favorites list for it is seriously one of a kind.

The film follows author Holly Martins as he arrives in Vienna after his old friend Harry Lime sends him a plane ticket.  Upon arriving though, Martins receives some disturbing news.  Harry has died, been hit by a car, and is being buried.  Instead of getting on the next plane and returning home, Holly decides that he is going to look into his friends untimely death for he's not so sure it was an accident as so many around him claim it to have been.  Holly struggles with Major Calloway, a British cop convinced that Lime was an unsavory character, not to mention trying to gather information from those who knew Harry, especially his beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt.  What Holly uncovers is far more than he expected, and much worse than he could have imagined.

Writer Graham Greene and director Carol Reed have crafted a marvelous film noir in `The Third Man', a film that is so superbly constructed it will never leave your mind.  Reed's effective use of lighting and sound is marvelous, and the rich black and white just elevates the mood of the film.  Seriously, I'm beginning to question why we ever moved over to color in the first place.  That zither score is unique and, while at first I didn't think it would work, ultimately it proves to be one of the films greatest facets.

The film instantly draws you in to the characters that their situation and manages to keep you guessing and ripe with anticipation as you uncover, along with Holly, the tragic truths behind Lime's fate.

Aiding Reed and Graham are the entire cast, Joseph Cotton stepping into the lead role of Holly Martins, and doing a fabulous job at that.  Cotton gives Holly a real sense of spark and determination, proving to the audience the importance within his motivations.  As the film spirals towards its dramatic closing we see the layers stripped away from Holly and are allowed to see his humanity battling itself, which is something I always love to see plaguing my actors.  Alida Valli is drop dead gorgeous as Anna, but she is far more than just window dressing.  She captures the struggle of a woman in love who cannot bear to accept all that her lover really was.  The single shot of her teary eyes is probably my single favorite scene in the film; a beautiful example of Reed using her actors to the full.  Trevor Howard also turns in a grand performance as Major Calloway, a man that is easy to dislike yet the only one you can truly trust.  He understands the true meaning of a supporting role, allowing Cotton to shine brightest yet never allowing his own character to suffer because of it.

And then that leads me to Welles, the `third man' from the title.  Welles single-handedly steals this entire film with a mere ten minutes or so of screen time.  When we first see him standing in the shadows (one of the greatest cinematic entrances of all time) we are intrigued, but when his character finally meets Holly face to face we are presented with Welles undeniable presence and ability.  He acts circles around Cotton and delivers a superb, undeniable performance that becomes the highlight of the film.  He is unforgettable in every sense of the word.

`The Third Man' truly lives up to the hype surrounding it.  The classic use of shadows throughout creates a vibe of uneasiness that elevates the drama and helps instill in the audience a mystery that is slowly unfolding before them.  When you add to this the immaculate script and the sublime performances you have a film that is not soon forgotten.  I saw this movie for the legend that is Orson Welles, but I kept watching because of everything else that so perfectly creates a marvelous cinematic experience.  There are few movies that come along like this one, movies that cannot be improved upon.",1213315200,3,4234,4.642953020134228

The VHS release of THE THIRD MAN has been fleshed out to a full two hours running time with the inclusion of a pre-movie analysis by Peter Bogdonovich, plus several items after the film, such as Anton Karas performing the theme song in a coffee house setting, a vintage advertising trailer, Gaumont newsreel footage and of especial interest, a comparison of film portions before and after digital restoration. These magical efforts have made a bona fide classic positively sparkle-- the movie has never looked better. The plot is of course always engaging while Cotten, Valli, Howard and Welles are simply unforgettable. This superb edition of the very best of Euro-film noir belongs in the collection of all lovers of great cinema.

(8.5) THE THIRD MAN (UK-1949) - Joseph Cotten/Alida Valli/Orson Welles/Trevor Howard/Bernard Lee/Wilfrid Hyde-White (uncredited: Lee Strasberg)

677702,5,630347327X,"This movie is a prime example of classic film, if not the staple of perfection in not only the crime/noir genre, but in all of cinema.  The setting is breathtaking, the acting is marvelous and the script is superb.  Movies that fill each of these categories with such perfection are few and far between, no matter the genre, no matter the year they were made.  Post WWII Vienna is a site to behold - a rare backdrop that can now only be mimicked, but here, in this film, is the real deal; a character all its own.  Speaking of characters, what a cast of characters it is.  So much is said of Wells' performance, but what about Valli?  The character Anna (Valli) is wonderful and smart, not a weak-minded sex object so often portrayed on film.  She has backbone and depth, something particularly impressive given the year in which this movie was made, let alone by today's standards.  The script was not cheapened with modern Hollywood clichs that tend to undermine a character's validity.  The last five minutes of the film is a perfect example of this as Holly (Cotton) waits for Anna.  Holly is a humorous and sympathetic protagonist and Harry Lime (Wells) delivers quite a speech that, like the movie itself, leaves quite a lasting impression.  Impressive, indeed.  Five stars.",1209427200,,1280,4.716216216216216
677703,3,630347327X,"I first went here to Amazon to decide whether or not to watch this movie, and after reading the first line of the Amazon editorial review for the two-disc version which said,  ""There have been few better movies in the history of the planet than The Third Man,""  well, that, of course, was convincing enough, right? I didn't bother reading any more. After watching it twice (the second time to make sure I didn't miss something entirely), all I can say is, Mr. Jameson (the editorial reviewer), what planet do you live on? You've got to be kidding.

Yeah, the cinematography is great, and film-school sophomores will ooh and aah over the black and white camera angles and dramatic use of lighting, probably ogling over that aspect so much that they miss completely the dismal nature of the story and characters, which I suspect most of the reviewers do also.

Yeah, it's well acted too. And hey, it's beautifully lit. The lighting man should have gotten as much credit as Carol Reed. This leads to one of my most down and dirty complaints about this movie. Where's all that light coming from down there in the sewers in the middle of the night? Chase scenes through brick caverns which should be pitch black, and none of the main characters are carrying any form of torch or flashlight. Well,  they didn't need one. It was all so nicely, although somewhat dimly, lit down there. You could even see rats scurrying fifty feet away.

The fiftieth anniversary edition which I have has an interesting little featurette showing actual film footage of those sewers, and yes, I'm right, they're pitch black--in the middle of the day no less--just as one would assume. Usually, I'll give a film some leeway on stuff like this, but sorry, the scenario is essential to the plot. Quite frankly, the way these scenes are, it's pure movie fantasyland. I guess for most people, you can get away with  anything in the movies, however preposterous.  If the Lone Ranger can easily jump his horse thirty feet from one canyon side to the other, then what's a little light down in the sewers where there shouldn't be any? Carol Reed must have known the sewers were actually pitch black. So did Orson Welles, So did Joseph Cotten, So did...etc., etc. No one said, ""Um,  Mr. Reed, you know, there's actually no light down in the underground sewers, especially in the middle of the night?"" Or maybe I missed that part where one of the characters, twice, turned on the sewer's master switch for all those mysterious bulbs down there which provided light, but yet, were nowhere to be seen? And then if that's the case, what's with those Russian police who show up later carrying torches? I guess Russians have really bad low light vision compared to the rest of us. Poor guys--short-sighted Commies.

As for the story, how would you characterize it? Seems like it should be something called ""Pathetic Comedy,"" and on my second viewing I looked to see if maybe I  missed the crucial fact that it's actually supposed to be a comedy. It's got that ridiculous zither score, after all. The main character is a dope who is a dope throughout--must have been a dope all his life if he hadn't seen this coming in Harry Lime--and ends still a dope. He's a sucker for a woman who's a dope, and she's even worse yet--she's a dope in complete denial that she's a dope. Cotten's character doesn't seem intelligent enough to fully realized he's a dope, while the woman...well, it's hard to say since she doesn't say much besides, ""I loved him"" and ""I love him."" Not much else going on in that mind. She's like a walking zombie when we first meet her, and she ends the same way (great shot though). Poor Calloway, he was right all along--he's surrounded by cheap criminals and duped dopes.

But wait, Calloway's a dope too. He never looked at the body? He didn't check the dead man's body and clothing for evidence and cause of death before they hastily put him in the ground? They had a formal inquest, but none of the inspectors looked at the body of one of their top suspects? Preposterous!! Fire the whole military police force. They're completely inept. The Keystone Cops would have done better. More fantasyland!

Maybe it really was suppose to be a comedy. If so, it was all miscast. For the fun of it, imagine the Calloway character being played by Groucho Marx instead. Same mustache and with a  good cigar. He calls the dopes into his office to play, ""You Bet Your Life"":

""Now Mr. Martins, say the magic word and you win a trip back home. Ok now, here's your question. If he walks like a criminal, and quacks like a criminal, then he must be...?""

""My best friend?"" Quack. Sorry. Cue the zither.

A lot of reviewers rave about Orson Welles in this flick. Why? His part is borderline cameo. His presence is minimal. Yes, he's got that wry Welles smile. How did this smart-looking guy end up in bombed-out Vienna, anyway? He speechifies for a couple of minutes--makes a clever few lines about the Borgias and the Swiss which actually has no pertinence to the story. I mean, is high art or engineering going on someplace because of this little underground clique of his? Is Vienna blooming into a new Renaissance because of the support of the nefarious? Did I miss the scene where Harry's shown funding a monumental marble statue of David? Maybe it was somewhere down in that big gloomy sewer tunnel. From my viewing, I didn't  see anyone in Vienna even making a cuckoo clock. Maybe Harry paid for the balloons. He did invite Martins to Vienna for some reason. Maybe by sponsoring Martins he was hoping his dopey friend would turn into the next Machiavelli and write a new version of ""The Prince"" based on himself, Harry Lime, except this time the Prince would be a gun-slinging cowpoke. Harry Lime is basically the most pathetic guy in Vienna, and his plight is almost comical. It's ""High Noon"" between the Pulp Western writer and the big-time loser in the black hat.

That speech by Welles was ad-libbed. Guess he saw a need to actually give this character a little historically informed philosophical depth which Graham Greene forgot to do--pretend he's a little more than just a greed-driven jerk with a disdain for everyone. Well, that was the extent of it--maybe a minute or two of deep thought. Now, on to chasing the sewer rat. If you're looking for any surprise revelations after that scene, you'll be disappointed. I've read some saying there's layers of intrigue in this film. No there's not. There's one layer of criminal intrigue, a pathetic death, and a couple of dopes for whom, at the end, it all just seems to keep flying over their heads.

Sorry folks, from my point of view, the script is weak. Questions about loyalty? Only a dope would find reason to remain loyal after that ferris wheel scene, loves or no loves. Calloway has to resort to tricks of graphic displays to conquer dopey--how pathetic.

The Europeans seem to always get a kick out of portraying Americans as naive dupes. I'll tell you, that's what this film is about and I wouldn't doubt that it's one of the main reasons the movie made it to the top of the BFI's Best of the 20th Century list. The subconscious, after all, is a great ruler over our sense of pleasure. That ending is just laughing at Mr. Martins, the dopey American.

Here's some telling facts. Graham Greene's original story concept had all British main characters, except for one American character. Guess who the one American character was. The American in Greene's original story was the Popescu character, who I would say seems to be the top dog, the shrewdest and most powerful of the criminal clique (Greene's original name for him was Cooler). So in the rewrite (by Reed?), the shrewdest character is changed from an American to an Eastern European, and the biggest dupe in the story is changed from an Englishman to an American (well, he's the biggest dupe besides the mentally ill Anna). Why the change of nationalities? Popular vote, maybe?

My suggestion is, if you're into film noir, after you watch this one, go and watch Humphrey Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" and decide which planet you'd want to be on. And if Orson were still around, I'd suggest to him that he go watch ""Chinatown"" again and then repeat his claim that there are no great performances in color (a claim that Peter Bogdanovich mentions in the special features of my DVD). In the history of film noir alone--on my  planet--I can think of a couple of films that I'd say are, at least, a little better than ""The Third Man.""

Ok, so why don't you leave a comment or two along with the negative vote you're about to give my review. Try and address one of my complaints, maybe. How about the light underground. That should be easy. Try that for starters. But please, I don't think I want to hear any explanations for the zither. I'd rather not even  be reminded of it.

Thanks for your time.

This film seems to hold up better than most, but would tend to appeal mostly to collectors or cinematic students. Vienna in those days was partitioned much the same way as Berlin for a short time after the war, and Cotten is back trying to determine the fate of an old friend, Harry Lime. All reliable sources have Lime either dead or missing in another quadrant of Vienna. The police know Lime well, giving Cotten a tour of a local hospital, where Lime's racket of selling watered down penicillin at inflated prices has permanently ruined many lives, mostly children. The old friends meet on a ferris wheel, Lime admits his guilt, and soon it's Cotten and the police against Lime, accompanied by Director Reed's use of zither background music, which drives this reviewer crazy. The climax is grotesque and painful, but fits the entire tenor of the film. The story is well told, and the minor players, save for a whining tot, all play their roles well. This production is an old favorite of mine. Give it a try!(Obvious reporting error-Film was made in 1949, not 1933 as listed).",1201996800,4,1149,4.721393034825871

677780,2,630347327X,"Graham Greene originally wrote ""The Third Man,"" a fine novel of intrigue about Post WW II Vienna, Austria, when the city, for a time, was divided up amongst frequently adversarial ""Allies"".

In both the book and the movie, a man named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is down on his luck -- a well-to-do acquaintance in Vienna, Harry Lime (Orson Wells), sends him passage to this city of possible opportunity in which Holly envisions a lot of promise... but when Holly arrives in Vienna, his pal, Harry, is being buried! The ambiance of the book/film is that of political intrigue combined with a murder mystery.

I'll summarize this film up front: Here, we have yet another bizarre film associated with Orson Wells. Yes, the film has been highly acclaimed in the past by critics as being ""artful""... but this movie fails utterly for the average viewer today.

The transitions from one scene to the next are very abrupt. This is quite distracting. Also, they've taken Greene's clear, straightforward story and made it notably incoherent. And it's clear that a huge priority for Orson Wells was to focus upon his personal ""surprised-look-profile"" for whatever time he's on screen -- his personal vanity ultimately dominates the story. The film climaxes in a multi-national foot chase through the active underground sewers of Vienna which drags on for much too long.

The worst facet of this flick is the weird filmscore -- the director decided to have the entire filmscore rendered by some guy who singularly played old Bavarian pub songs on a Zither! Don't know what a Zither is? It's the only musical instrument that is actually more noxious than an accordion! The end product is that the music comes off as distracting and totally inappropriate to the various dramatic scenes.

Finally, I DO need to point out that Joseph Cotten's performance in this film was indeed very good. Unfortunately, he had little with which to work.

You might wish to view this film as a curiosity but, beyond that, you're probably going to be shaking your head at what they did to Graham Greene's fine volume of period literature.",1198713600,10,2107,4.904494382022472
677781,4,630347327X,"NOTE: this is an edit of my original review, based on my re-watching it and some discussion/feedback I've had; one of the changes I had wanted to make was to bump it up from 4 stars to 5, but Amazon will not let me edit that.

I'd never seen this, but based on its reputation was very interested in checking it out. Its reputation turns out to be richly deserved. I only have two complaints, one minor, and one major.

First, the DVD jacket itself gives away a major plot twist by telling you who Orson Welles' character is. Since I didn't know the plot going in, that took a lot of the suspense out.

My major complaint, though, is the soundtrack. I realize (now) that the zither was a ubiquitous instrument of the time and place, so yes, it does fit the ""flavor"" of the setting. Unfortunately, it does not fit the ""mood"" of the film itself. The movie is a tense, taught thriller, and the music is mostly happy major-key meanderings, which I find totally at odds with film's feel. I honestly found it distracting, and even annoying. On viewing it again, I was able to better tune it out/ignore it, but ocasionally I was still conscious of it, and still disliked it. Then again, the score obviously has its fair share of supporters who love it, so your mileage may vary.

That said, the plot is crisp (and rife with paranoia), the sets/locations are fantastic, and the cinemetography was awesome. This is perhaps the best black & white film I have seen that plays to the medium: use of lighting and shadows was masterful. The climax, in the sewers, was worth the price of admission alone, and mercifully wasn't ruined by the horrible music.

The DVD extras are okay but don't have a high repeat value. One of the nice things, though, was a segment showing the extent of restoration done to the film. Kudos to the team that handled repairs: this restored version looks great!

The movie's plot, as you know, centers around an American writer, Holly Martens, who goes to post-War Vienna to work for a friend named Harry Lime. When he gets there, he finds that Lime has met an untidy end, one that gets more and more untidy as Martens begins to pull at the loose threads of the story, until finally he finds a truth he never expected.

As I said, I'd only recently seen the film for the first time, and I was very impressed by it! The acting was amazingly good as was the direction, and the plot was sensational! Kept me guessing all the way through (am I the only one who thought the balloon-man was a certain character in disguise? I bet not).

The film is also filled with incredible moments. The aforementioned ballon-man. The appearance of Welles, which is probably the best reveal in movie history. The cukoo-clock speech. The chase through the sewers was VERY impressive and that alone makes the film worth watching!

677880,5,630347327X,"This is a rare film that is flawless in every respect. It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score. ""The Third Man"" is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles' wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises. Adding to these is Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.

The story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket. Martins sets out at once to prove his friend's innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better. It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality. There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins. The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.

The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.

The intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likeable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.

Graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles' masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane</a>. Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brief-Encounter/dp/0780023420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brief Encounter</a>, Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.

Another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Even though the Criterion Collection released an excellent fiftieth anniversary DVD just eight years ago in 1999, they have produced an even robust two-disc 2007 DVD package that will no doubt please followers of the classic film. Same as the 1999 DVD, the newer release provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration and a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles.

The 2007 additions include an informative video introduction by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich; an enthusiastic commentary track by director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy; a second, more academic commentary track by NYU film professor Dana Polan; and an audio reading of Graham Greene's treatment for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man/dp/0140286829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man</a>&nbsp;by actor Richard Clarke and played as an alternate track. One of the best extras is a ninety-minute 2004 documentary, ""Shadowing the Third Man"", where assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen tour the film's locations in modern-day Vienna. There is also archival footage of composer Anton Karas playing his zither in a London supper club, as well as vintage newsreel footage of the Vienna sewers. This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time.",1181433600,10,4358,5.956869009584665
677886,5,630347327X,"The Criterion Collection released an excellent edition on DVD many years ago and is revisiting it again this year. It is so rare that a double-dipped title is worth buying. Usually, only a few new extras are added and then resold to the public but this new edition is worth picking up even if you have the previous one. A wealth of new extras have been added making this a must-have for any film buff.

The first disc features an introduction by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. He talks about Reed as an underrated director and herald's the film's atmospheric black and white cinematography. Naturally, he talks about Welles' role in the film.

There is an audio commentary by filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy. Not surprisingly, they talk about the nuts and bolts mechanics of the story and the film's style. They just don't talk about the film as fans but from the point-of-view of filmmakers as well. This commentary is like watching the film with these two guys in your living room - very casual and conversational but never dull.

There is a second commentary by film scholar Dana Polan. He argues that The Third Man is a hybrid film with various identities and moralities. Polan cites plenty of examples within the film to support his thesis while also exploring its themes. This track is a nice contrast to the first as it is more scholarly in nature.

""The Third Man Treatment"" features actor Richard Clarke reading Graham Greene's abridged treatment for the film with a preface that explains the story's origins.

The second disc starts off with ""The Third Man File,"" a collection of featurettes that include a production history by Charles Drazin, author of In Search of The Third Man; a comparison of the U.S. and U.K. versions of the film which included different opening voiceover narrators; subtitles for the scenes that featured untranslated foreign languages which is a nice touch; the original U.S. trailer; and the original U.K. press book.

Perhaps, the strongest extra in the entire two-disc set is ""Shadowing The Third Man,"" Frederick Baker's definitive 90-minute documentary on the film with visits to some of the original locations and archival interviews with key cast and crew members. This is a fascinating look at how this film came together including filming anecdotes told by those who were there.

""Who Was The Third Man?"" is a 30-minute documentary made for the 50th anniversary of the film's Austrian premiere with a look on how Vienna and the country in general were presented.

""The Third Man on the Radio"" features a radio play that was only one of a series that acted as prequels, fleshing out Harry Lime's past. Many were in fact written and performed by Welles himself. Also included is a radio play adaptation of the film with Cotton reprising his role.

""Graham Greene: The Hunted Man"" is a rare 1968 BBC profile of this famous novelist and screenwriter. Almost 60 minutes in length, it is an excellent look at his life and illustrious career.

Finally, there is ""From the Archives,"" a collection of various odds and ends, including a brief look at composer Anton Karas playing the zither; a look at the underground sewers of Vienna and how they were patrolled by the police in old, archival footage; and a pictorial essay about Vienna during the time that the movie takes place which gives a nice historical perspective.",1180915200,11,3381,4.884816753926701

Not to mention the cover art for this edition is better looking than the last one which pretty much gave away the secret of ""The Third Man"".  I first saw this movie in August of 1999 right around the time a little movie called ""The Sixth Sense"" just arrived in theaters nationwide. Anyway, back to ""The Third Man"",  That was a great movie too.  I especially like the opening narration from Carol Reed who made this film in 1949. The actors were great and so was the music. Let's just say they don't make 'em like this anymore.",1180483200,3,610,4.371681415929204

I saw more flaws, skips, and audio hiccups watching Pirates of the Carribean - At World's End last weekend at the movie theater only a day after its release  -that is how great this picture looks after more than 50 years.

Also included in this set is a vast info-dump about the filmmakers and the impact this film had on the world at the time. It's fascinating stuff, to me.

The only disappointment was the audio commentary by Dana Polan, a NYU Film Studies professor that offers one of the two audio commentaries of the The Third Man. I wish Criterion Collection had encouraged his comments to reveal more about the film, it's production, history, anecdotes, etc. Instead, Polan spends an inordinate amount of time discussing character types, motivations, and what he calls ""homosocial/[...]"" themes using words I had to look up like ""insouciant"". In one instance, after Holly Martins returns from the funeral of his friend and is sharing a drink with a police officer he met there, Polan says ""this shows that Holly is easily plied with alcohol to give up secrets."" I think the more obvious reading is that he is grieving. I felt like a lot of the time Polan filled up too many minutes pounding into our heads how Holly is a ""loser"" character, which is true, but the least of many things I wish he had discussed at various points in the picture. The most pathetic part of the commentary is when Polan repeatedly points out the ""homosocial/[...]"" themes whenever there are two men talking to each other in the movie. Regardless of the fact that males are playing traditional male roles such as police officers and gangsters, Polan finds the need to point out that there is some kind of homosocial connection there. Whatever. I was especially disgusted when he giddily describes the police stakeout in which the two main police officer characters are hiding in the shadows to nab Harry Lime as a ""[...] cruising"" episode where men are lurking in shadows looking for sex. In reality, and what is not discussed at all by Polan in this scene as he is documenting his perceived fantasy, is the building and release of tension through the use of waiting in the ruins, the red herring of the balloon seller, and the surprise of Harry Lime showing up where they least expect him. Polan does provide a steady stream of informative detail relating to other films such as Lang's ""M"" and another film that takes place in the sewers, which was helpful. However, too much of his focus was misplaced on irrelevant details that were difficult to swallow. Is this what is taught in film studies at NYU? I'll stay away.

Overally, this is a great movie easily deserving of 5 stars and the presentation is fantastic. I just hope Criterion Collection can reign-in their academic commentators so that their future discs don't start to feel like they have unneccessary filler in them.",1180483200,15,2952,4.72621359223301

You'll have to decide for yourself if the bells and whistles are worth the extra money, but if you want to save yourself a few bucks then you're not missing too much with the older version.

Honestly, Criterion would have done us all more of a service if they'd finally gotten ""Our Man in Havana"" out on DVD instead of putting out a deluxe edition of ""The Third Man.""

677981,5,630347327X,"Who was Harry Lime (Orson Welles)? An evil man, devil in the flesh who was responsible for the unspeakable crimes, yet brilliant, cheerful and charismatic. His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:

""In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""

No wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd done...

It has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever - but what about his 'exit' - the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, too...

A beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti-Hollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.

Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had - the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose - instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place - cheerful but melancholy in the same time...

Criterion DVD is wonderful - the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available - British and American, and a lot of extras.",1177632000,67,2034,4.636111111111111
677982,5,630347327X,"So many times, we hear a movie called ""classic"", that it's incredibly difficult to know which ones to take a chance on.  Well, on the TCM channel, I reluctantly watched ""The Third Man"" for several reasons, but the key reason is this --- it was supposed to include the greatest entrance of a film character EVER!  ""The Third Man"" does have that, but also a lot more that modern audiences will still love!

The story is that a fiction novelist travels to Europe to meet up with an old friend named Harry Lime.  In an odd bit of timing, Lime's funeral is just finishing as the novelist arrives, but quickly realizes that the circumstances were more than suspicious.

Okay, now you might yell ""Alright, so the hero finds a ally or two, and the authorities don't help, and there's more to the death than there seems, and blah-blah-blah...WHO CARES?""  But let me assure you, I haven't seen a mystery film this brilliant and timeless in a long time.

The movie doesn't rely on obvious red herrings or plot revelations that insult the audience.  Nope, instead ""The Third Man"" relies on a sensible screenplay (written by Graham Greene) and filmmaking of the highest class.  I don't care for black-and-white films much, but this movie's use of shadows and darkness brings an unusual clarity and suspense to the picture.  The musical score is seductive and captivating (I believe a viola or zither of some sort is the key instrument).  There is a love story that isn't melodramatic, but subtle and romantic.  Lime's girlfriend is a compelling character, and is everything Bergman's ""Casablanca"" character should've been.  The dialogue is sharp, poignant, and sometimes humorous.  And most of all, the chase and suspense sequences work perfectly!  Hitchcock would've loved this movie, if he hadn't already seen it!

What I'm getting at is this: ""The Third Man"" doesn't screw around, and doesn't aim to please the elitist artists in the film community only.  ""The Third Man"" is a mystery that anyone will get into, because it cuts the crap and gets to the core of what these characters are about, and accomplishes that feat with superb style that hasn't aged a bit!

Now, the Criterion DVD isn't out yet, but every DVD of the Criterion Collection I own features a plethora of insightful Extras, and has fantastic video/audio restoration.

Still unsure if you want to see this 1949 black-and-white movie with actors you've never heard of?  Well fine, rent it first, thank me later, and do yourself a favor with the Criterion DVD in a few weeks!  ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"" --- this time, I agree.

NEW NOTES
I've added a little to the review since I first posted it.  As for the Extras, they're all pretty good.  Peter Bogdanovich's 5 minute introduction is pleasant to listen to.  The 90-minute making-of documentary is very good.  There's a 5-minute broadcast of the zither being played in a restaurant.  Joseph Cotten's opening monologue that was used for the American release (director Carol Reed voiced it in the original version) is available.  The two commentary tracks are also excellent: one's by Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"") and writer Tony Gilroy (the ""Bourne"" movies) which is more reflective and congratualatory -- kind of like two film students admiring a classic; The 2nd track is from film scholar Dana Polan, whose commentary is comparable to anything Stephen Prince did for the Kurosawa DVDs -- insightful and easy to follow.

677985,5,630347327X,"For me, ""The Third Man"" has everything needed in a movie. It has Romance and Adventure, a man from America visiting his friend in a war torn Vienna and the realization that his friend was apparently murdered. It has mystery, excellent dialogue; it is filled with humor and surreal depth as well as an amazing chemistry between all the characters. Orson Welles plays the perfect role of Harry Lime, the primary character that the movie is all about.  Alida Valli plays a superbly charming Anna Schmidt.  How can Joseph Cotton's character not fall for her hopeless romantic character?

The movie has historical fact and significance as it was filmed in Vienna shortly after the end of World War II and gives us information about the city just after World War II. I never knew that like Vienna, like Berlin, was under Russian, British, American, and French control at the end of the WW2.

On top of all of this, there is an amazing moodiness to this movie in both  the lighting, music, and acting.

677986,1,630347327X,"My wife and I love classic movies, and Joseph Cotten was great in thrillers like Shadow of a Doubt. This was also billed as a great thriller, so we had high expectations. We were sadly disappointed. We felt little emotional connection to the characters. It's hard to care about the murder of character that does not even appear in the movie before the murder. None of the characters, even Cotten's, seemed interesting or attractive. The story was just plain dull and the pace dragged. Worst of all was the horrible zither music. I actually was intrigued to hear the theme music since I was told that I would be humming it for weeks. Little did I know that that was not a compliment, but a warning! I have never heard such obnoxious, god-awful movie music in my life. It was totally inappropriate for the dark tone of a film noir like this. And the same idiotic tune just kept on going throughout the film, even underneath the dialogue in many scenes. This was a total blunder. It absolutely RUINED the impact of many scenes that might have otherwise been powerful. Far too obtrusive and distracting. Several times when the music was loud and there was little dialogue, we muted the film. Sometimes we even muted it when there was dialogue and just turned on the subtitles.

I think the objective of the filmmakers here was mainly to make a unique film using unorthodox or untried techniques, as a way of getting the critics' attention. It does succeed in that way, I suppose, but I think it can only be really enjoyed by film students who focus on technique instead of a story line.

678049,5,630347327X,"This movie is a masterpiece.  Not only the main production itself but also all the ancillary material that comes with the Criterion DVD.  Particularly fascinating is the reading of Graham Greene's actual text.  Described on the jacket as an ""abridged recording of Graham Green's treatment,"" it is actually a replay of the entire film with the dialog replaced by an actor reading passages from the book.  Sometimes, the narrative doesn't quite jibe with what is being shown on the screen, however, it actually augments the original dialog beautifully and imparts depth to the characters.  In a few spots, the disparity is a little disconcerting, such as when Crabbin is introduced.  The character in the movie (played by Wilfred Hyde-White) is portrayed as a composed, genial, elderly English gentleman.  As he enters the scene, however, he is described in the voice-over of Greene's narrative as ""a stout, middle-aged young [sic] man with a natural tonsure and the thickest pair of horn-rimmed glasses that Martins had ever seen.""  These incongruencies between the film and the narrative, however, are actually more amusing than jarring.

The cast is perfect, though I cannot understand why this movie is seen as being a star-turn for Orson Welles.  The performances of both Joseph Cotton and Trevor Howard are infinitely more polished and effective than that of Welles and it's hard to understand why he has been so lionized over the years as the star of the picture.  In fact, he doesn't even appear until near the end of the film, and when he does his acting style seems very studied, very ""method.""

As to the production itself, while it's become something of a clich that filming in black and white enhances dramatic value, it must be said that in The Third Man, it is also quite true.  In fact, the effect is spectacular, and I cannot imagine that color would do anything but detract from the impact.  The photography is so evocative and so perfectly attuned to the story as it unfolds that it alone is worth the price of admission.

It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless style... Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever done... Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of Vienna... Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplary... Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... ""The Third Man"" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War II...

The night city terrain of ""The Third Man"" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Russian...

Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papers...

Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villain...

These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafs, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheel...

The Vienna of ""The Third Man"" is a vast city that seems empty... Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneath... It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pity...

""The Third Man"" meets the test of complexity... The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a ""third man"" carried off Lime's ""body,"" there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crosses...

Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called ""Chinese angles,"" employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universe... He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of Hitchcock...

""The Third Man"" is unique in the genre for its realism... Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuine--a tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writing...

Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good taste... It is this taste, of course, that works so well in ""The Third Man,"" but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as ""Our Man in Havana,"" which require a certain amount of excess to make them work...",1168732800,8,3420,5.306839186691312

I'm only now starting to venture into the classics of film, but with movies like The Third Man by my side, I am fully assured I will have a thoroughly pleasant experience. From brief looks at the reviews and the summary, I expected this to be a film noir detective story in the classical sense, with first-person narratives and dark, pulpy environs. This movie, starting from its cheery introductory tune, completely broke those expectations. There are plenty of shadows, of course, and clouds of smoke, but hardly the dreariness of DOA.

As soon as my surprise was gone, however, the vacuum was filled with earnest curiosity at the potential the plot offered from the very start, and it never once managed to disappoint. I was never keen on detective stories, much less allowed myself to be absorbed by them, but this was simply an intriguing movie from the very onset.

678055,5,630347327X,"""The third man"" is a CLASSIC, in capital letters. That is, one of those few films everybody that loves well-made movies should watch at least once. Directed by Carold Reed, and based on a script written by Graham Green, this film has action and a mystery, but also some romance, and a beautiful cinematography that you cannot help but admire. In my opinion, this is simply the kind of movie you will not be able to forget, if you give yourself the opportunity of watching it.

The story begins when a novelist without a dime, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), arrives to Vienna in search of a job his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has promised him. Unfortunately, he learns from the police that Harry has died in dubious circumstances, and that he was involved in criminal activities. Refusing to believe that, Holly decides to investigate what really happened to Harry, in order to restore his reputation. But can knowledge be a dangerous commodity in post World War II Vienna?

On the whole, I think you will love this splendid noir movie, and that you will be fully immersed in the mistery of ""The third man"" as soon as you begin watching it. What will happen to Holly Martins in his search of truth? And who was Harry Lime? Those are answers that you will only find in this film, not in this review. I can promise you something, though: you will not find it boring!

There are very few perfect movies, but if you want to enjoy one, The Third Man is it.  With Orson Wells on the cover, it spoils a large surprise of the plot, but this cannot be blamed on the film-makers.

Joseph Cotton gives a perfect performance as a good guy who writes bad novels and falls too hard for women he shouldn't.  When he comes to Europe to meet with his friend and finds him dead, he attempts to find out what really happened, only to fall for his friend's lover and find out more than he wanted to know.

With one of the greatest scenes in movie history between Cotton and Wells in a deserted ferris wheel, this is a great, great movie.  For fans of noir, this is a great Euro-Noir (check out the shot of the police hiding invisibly in the shadows, only their faces appearing at random in the light).

Conversely, if you couldn't see the film, then the use of well-delivered lines by actors who know their craft, foreign language to transport you to another place and time, and high drama would be enough to satisfy.  Luckily many of us can enjoy both simultaneously.  The story, centered around a post-war theme keeps your interest piqued to the end and makes this film a winner in multiple categories.

678148,5,630347327X,"As I watched the final frames play out on THE THIRD MAN, I knew that I'd just witnessed the cinematic equivalent of great poetry.  Something in the bleak, hopelessness of the scene (and the human experience) were summed up in the dead leaves drifting lifelessly across the screen and in the way that Holly Martins lights another cigarette and bitterly tosses the match to the ground.

Technically, the film is flawless in ever way.  The original screenplay by Graham Greene, the breathtaking direction of Sir Carol Reed, the haunting performances of Joseph Cotton, Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Wilfred Hyde-White, Ernst Deutsch and others, the stunning noir photography of Robert Krasker (he won the Academy Award for it), and of course the unforgettable music of Anton Karas that becomes a Greek Chorus commenting on the tragic events as they unfold.

But what really makes this film stand head and shoulders above all others is the fact that it somehow manages to function on multiple levels (psychodrama, critique on art, political commentary, loss of innocence fable, exploration of ""reality"" vs ""fantasy"", the moral grayness of the world, etc.) while remaining on the surface level, a slick, captivating Hitchcockian thriller (although Hitchcock never made anything half so complex -- including VERTIGO).

I won't give away any elements of the plot here, but some important elements to note are the way that Anna mistakenly calls Holly ""Harry""; how Holly is accused several times of mixing himself up with the heroes of the cowboy pulp novels that he writes; how actress Anna tells Holly that she doesn't play tragedy; how idealistic Holly refuses to ""be sensible"" to the very end, and many more.

The film also abounds in subtle touches, that make successive viewings rewardable.  For instance Harry and Anna's relationship is revealed to have been sexual when upon visiting Harry's former apartment with Holly and the Porter, she absent-mindedly removes a hairbrush from his dresser drawer and begins brushing her hair.  It is further reinforced when, later in the film, she is shown lying awake in her darkened apartment in Harry's pajamas (identified by the ""H"" embroidered on the pocket).  This latter incident further shows her refusal to let go of Harry ... as well as her identification with him.

Over the years, I've watched this film many times (both the American and British versions), and each time, with a fuller understanding.  ""Death's at the bottom of everything"" Calloway says, even death is questionable as the funeral scene repeats itself.

678150,5,630347327X,"This edition presents a stunning digital restoration of perhaps century 20's most iconic and universal film.  The process was done painstakingly frame by frame as is demonstrated on one of the special features.  The result is a breathtaking, and the film should now be seen only in this version.

If one is new to this film, it is important to avoid reviews that give away much of the plot, and to just sit down and see it.  Briefly, the story is straightforward, deceptively simple, and morally and ethically bottomless.  A friend's investigation of an old pal's death in post World War 2 Vienna quickly opens up into a tale of the black market and its consequences, particularly involving vital medical products.  The writer-investigator meets another on the trail:  a British officer and criminal detective.  He also meets someone with another type of loyalty to the deceased:  a lover for whom the decedent forged a passport to freedom from the Russian sector.  All is set against the Balkanized occupied city where the wartime survivors eke out a marginal existence.

Largely shot on location including many bleak cityscapes including the Venetian sewer system, beauty seems an odd word to attatch to this stark black and white film.  But director Carol Reed's vision and verve produced just that.  The older version I had seen at least 4 times previously was atmospheric; that element remains, but the restoration raises it all to rare grandeur.  Of course, as is well known, every performance was by a major talent at top form -- Orson Welles, Valli, Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard.  And the script by the major British novelist Graham Greene has to rank as one of his unlikely but top life achievements.  Of course, there is a wonderful earthy gravity to the whole project, and viewers should approach it in that light and not as something with too many big words attatched to it.  You will have your own unique reaction and words after you experience it.

Superlatives thus fail to encompass the greatness of this film -- not a self-conscious art film, either -- indeed half film noir, and with a gritty realism and a profound, but entirely unforced and unsentimental moral center.  But yes, it is likely one of the major artworks of the last century -- in any category.  After 50 years it retains the immediacy of something that happened just yesterday, nailed down by the last grand, silent take.",1158796800,5,2405,4.862407862407863

As other reviewers have noted, the film techniques - the lighting, camera angles, the zither music - are awesome. There are very many odd or striking occurances, and the characters are all sharply drawn, even the lesser ones. Harry Lime's first appearance, when the cat snuggles up to his feet and then only his face is illuminated, opens up the moral ambivalence of this film: of someone having an attractive personality who has the chilling ability to abstract and compartmentalize the worst of evils.

Is Harry the warm friend others thought him to be? The police paint an entirely different picture. In the hunt for clues Holly must sacrifice some of the virtues of affection, loyalty and honesty for the sake of others.

Each character has personal struggles to resolve which are communicated with appropriate facial expressions that sometimes tell more than the words being spoken. Every actor delivers a strong character performance.

I long assumed the movie was directed by Orson Welles but Carol Reed deserves the credit. THE THIRD MAN cinematography is the gold standard by which other noirs can be measured. The use of shadows to signal an unanticipated intruder is extremely well done and heightens requisite drama and suspense. The progressive revelation of an anticipated character by the affectionate cat, the shoe in the doorway and finally the white of the eyes peering from the darkness is spectacular. This and the underground chase are my favorite scenes though there is much more to enjoy. I could not even begin to imagine this masterpiece in color.

If you haven't seen it before, you are in for a treat. If you've seen it once, watch it again. If you viewed it twice there's more joy to be discovered a third time.

It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.

To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.

In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.

The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy",1146787200,3,1385,4.576612903225806
678157,5,630347327X,"Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" is a superbly concocted film noir thriller filmed amid the ruins of post war Vienna.  Filmed in shadowy black and white and accompanied by a sad and haunting musical score played on the zither, the film embodies all the classic qualities of this genre.

Penniless American writer Holly Martins, played by the vastly underrated Joseph Cotten arrives in Vienna at the behest of his long time friend Harry Lime, with an offer of employment.  Vienna has been partitoned by the conquering Allied forces into American, English, French and Russian zones. Cotten arrives at Lime's flat to find that he has apparently been killed in a traffic accident.
Proceeding to the cemetary he meets Trevor Howard playing British Major Calloway and Anna Schmidt, Lime's girlfriend played by Alida Valli.

Cotten soon learns from Howard who is a key member of the multinational governing force that Lime played by the incomparable Orson Welles is a wanted fugitive of justice and an unprincipled racketeer.  He apparently masterminded the robbery of a load of precious penicillin from a miltary hospital.  He then sold it after diluting it to such an extent as to make it ineffective. This ineffectual stolen medicine was used to combat an outbreak of meningitis resulting in countless cases of death and madness.

Cotten is eventually coaxed to capture Lime who actually faked his death.  Welles first appears on the screen in dramatic fashion, halfway through the film, nattily attired and skulking in a darkened doorway when a light from a window hilights his face.

This superb film culminates in an unforgetable chase through the bowels of Vienna's vast underground sewer system.  The hand of Welles is felt throughout this film as he was an uncredited contributor to the screenplay created by Graham Greene and Alex Korda.",1144800000,5,1836,5.069767441860465
678208,5,630347327X,"The Third Man is a wonderful atmospheric film set in postwar Vienna. There are so many great and thrilling scenes in this film: Orson Welles' entrance, the confrontation on top of the ferris wheel, the final chase through the sewers. As a suspense thriller alone, The Third Man is a very good film.

However, for me, what makes The Third Man a great film is its tale of frustrated love. Joseph Cotten's Holly Martins is a good man who loves Alida Valli's Anna Schmidt. However, Anna loves Orson Welles' Harry Lime, an evil charmer who sells tainted black market penicillin, considers killing his best friend and would abandon the woman that loves him to save his own skin. Of the three major characters, Cotten's Martins is the one person who does the right thing. He does so reluctantly, although that reluctance stems from his loyalty to Harry and his love for Anna. Holly is the only person who really cares about Anna, but Anna rejects him in favor of Harry anyway. In the end, even though Holly is just doing the right thing, Anna hates him for betraying Harry and shooting him. The audience roots for Holly -- a rooting interest made even more poignant when, after Harry's funeral, Anna walks past Holly and out of his life.

So many times, the movies portray love stories as happy endings. John Hughes made a career out of having the kind, awkward social misfit end up with the prom queen or the high school jock. But, in real life, the object of our affections many times can't recognize the person who really cares about them -- instead choosing a lover who isn't really interested in love. It's unfair, it hurts, but, unfortunately, it's life and those who are rejected have to pick up the pieces and try to find love somewhere else -- now saddled with the added element of self-doubt. Holly Martins represents all of us who seek love, but who struggle to find someone who will return that love.",1143331200,19,1905,4.616519174041298

He's not remembered among the great actors of the 40s and 50s. Even though he did a chilling performance as Uncle Charlie in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", which should at least given him an Acadmey Award nomination for best actor.

Supposdely Lime has died due an automobile accident but Cotton thinks differently. So he's out to find out what really happened and ends up getting invloved in with racketeers, the disappearance of a man named Joesph Hobbin, and watered down  penicillin. Trevor Howard does a very good job as Major Calloway, the charming British police officer. And Valli does a splendid job as Lime's lover. Who can't decide to love Cotton or Welles. Orson Welles plays one of his most unforgettable roles as the sinister, evil minded gangster, Harry Lime. That scene when we first see him and he's standing in the doorway with that evil smile.

678211,5,630347327X,"Rarely has background music made such a transcendent impact on a film-going experience, but such is the case of Anton Karas's haunting zither in Carol Reed's 1949 dark thriller, a genuine classic of post-WWII deception and desperation. The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.

The intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likeable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.

Graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles's masterpiece, ""Citizen Kane"". Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's ""Brief Encounter"", Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.

Another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Celebrating the film's fiftieth anniversary, the 1999 Criterion Collection DVD package provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration, a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles.

678212,5,630347327X,"There's only one thing wrong with this movie, and that's Harry Lime's famous line. I believe it was written by Orson Welles himself. Graham Greene would never have been so flip, nor would he have inserted such an empty wisecrack. The line should have been: ""In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed. They produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce  --- Albert Einstein. So long, Harry."" Of course, it would have to have been said by Holly.

The camera angles also seem to have been heavily influenced by Welles's Citizen Kane, but here they work much better, since they are mostly non-studio. After reading all the reviews, I'm amazed at how this picture divides opinion, and equally amazed by some of the remarks. I can't understand why Hitchcock keeps getting mentioned. This film is quite unlike anything by Hitchcock. Although I believe Greene and Hitchcock have the influence of the Roman Catholic church in common, which causes them both to be concerned with the question of guilt, Hitchcock is an out-and-out Freudian, which means he is not really interested in the morality of human motivation; whereas Greene doesn't appear to be a Freudian of any sort at all. His concern is with questions of good and evil: the choices facing humans when they are presented with a dilemma. What is right, and what is wrong. This film is superb in the way it presents these dilemmas. Cotten is absolutely ideal as the weak, undecided, ordinary man, fascinated by those who are more charismatic than himself, and stumbling in his attempts to discover the right decisions to make. James Stewart would have been nothing like as good. This film isn't about the Orson Welles character, it's about Holly Martin. Martin is himself the real third man, hovering between two extremes in a very grey area between black and white.

The ending is exceptionally good, as the desirable woman walks straight past him, having come to her decision on purely emotional grounds, unaffected by the immorality, callousness or cynicism of the man she had committed herself to. Holly's feeble attempts to do the right thing leave him floundering. He would have done better, like everyone tells him, to fly straight back home and forget about the whole thing. After all, that's what most average Joes do: just ignore anything difficult or unpleasant, and look the other way. This is pure Graham Greene-land. It's not in any sense a thriller, or a suspense story, but an intellectual debate about right and wrong. Some of the comments by the reviewers on this site seem so mentally dense it makes one weep.

Now that I've watched the really outstanding documentary on the second disc, with the commentary spoken by John Hurt --- a great actor --- I'm even more staggered by the out-and-out stupidity of some the site reviewers. This analysis of the film, and its making, shows up precisely what an intellectual jerk Selznick must have been, what a sucker-milking money-maker, just like Harry Lime himself, and how a huge percentage of Americans are simple-minded hicks, without the remotest conception of aesthetics, or the multi-layered meanings of Europe's two thousand years of history, culture and suffering.

After watching Murnau's Faust, it becomes even clearer that, at the height of the ferris wheel, Welles has been cast as Satan tempting Everyman.",1137283200,3,3500,5.006872852233677

In terms of classic movies, ""The Third Man"" never seems to have the prominence of ""Casablanca,"" which seems a great shame.

The story opens in the late 1940's with Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arriving in war-ravaged Vienna hoping to gain employment from a long time friend named Harry Lime.  To Martins' utter shock, he learns that Lime was killed in a pedestrian accident in front of his apartment.  After questioning people who witnessed the accident, Martins becomes skeptical of the accounts since many things contradict themselves.  This sets up the remainder of the film where Martins tries to uncover the real truth and learns a lot more than he bargained for.

The film-noir artistry in this picture is incredible as Cotten walks the empty dark streets of historic Vienna at night.  The use of shadows and directional lighting is amazing.  But even beyond the look of the film, the plot and the acting are also excellent.  There is an unexpected surprise in the plot about two-thirds the way through the film and it changes the entire direction of the movie and puts the main character, Martins in a perplexing moral dilemma.  Orsen Welles appears in this film and also delivers a memorable performance.  Overall, the film is a terrific blend of mystery, intrigue and suspense and is an essential addition to any classic film buff's DVD library.

The DVD presentation is excellent considering the movie was made over 50 years ago and all prior offerings of the film have typically been substandard.  I recently saw part of Turner Classic Movies' presentation of this movie and it was nowhere as clean as the Criterion offering.  There are still occasional signs of tiny specs of deterioration on the DVD presentation, but rarely does it distract from the visual beauty and artistry of this film.  The sound is also impressive for a 50+-year-old film, which highlights Anton Karas's zither soundtrack.  There are plenty of bonuses including an introduction of by Peter Bagdanovich, and commentary by the author Graham Greene.

Martins is just a very ordinary guy getting mixed up in something so totally over his head, and Calloway wants him to leave Vienna before Martins succumbs to the danger of it all.  However, as Martins learns more about Harry's death, certain inconsistencies begin to unravel. The story unwinds compelling him to stay and discover that truth and justice take on a greater meaning.

This is a great film with such atmosphere that old Vienna is a main character. And of course the ubiquitous zither music that never ceases. Fog, shadows, wet streets and underground tunnels are the background to this Graham Green fantasy. Well acted by Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and of course Orson Welles playing Harry Lime. Graham Green's great story and screenplay, Carol Reed directing at his finest and the best cinematography by Robert Krasker.

The most famous line in the film is from Harry Lime (Welles) who, self-righteously tries to rationalize his evil. 'In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed. They produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce - the cuckoo clock. So long, Holly.'",1132704000,5,2143,5.028169014084507

Contrary to all the gushing reviews here, The Third Man is Orson Welles at his worst.  The mysterious character, Harry Lime, when he is finally seen (after much buildup) is completely uninteresting and shallow.  His trite dialog shows a character with no depth and reveals a writer with no imagination.

And that AWFUL zither music!!  This film must win the Golden Raspberry for worst soundtrack of all time!

If you are an Orson Welles fan, like myself, stay away from this film.  Pretend it never existed.  It is not a film noir except in the most amateurish sense.

It is one of a handful of films I go back to repeatedly, and revel in the atmosphere, the characters -- brought to life so vividly in this film with expert writing, beautiful cinematography, and flawless performances by the actors.

I find the acting in so many films of this era rather corny and amateurish. Perhaps it is the direction, perhaps they were inspired by the script, but the subtlety and believability of the  acting measures well against modern standards.

Technically this is nearly the best one could hope for in a DVD transfer. However, on a double layer DVD such as this one, with a capacity of 9 gigabytes of data, even more space could have been devoted to the film itself, less to the extras like two vintage Third Man radio broadcasts, which should not need many bytes. Because the film is so grainy -- authentically so (and I personally like the effect of film grain, especially in a noir film such as this) -- technically this requires a lot of digital bits to properly reproduce. The DVD looks great, but it would look even better if raised to ""SuperBit"" data rates in the encoding stage. But, this is a minor quibble.

I love the look of the film and the people in it. The only thing I don't care for is the zither music, which I find slightly annoying at times. However, I believe it captures somehow the atmosphere of postwar Vienna, and as such I accept it.

Finally, the centerpiece of the film -- a conversation between Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten -- is such a classic that everyone should see this movie once, if only to hear Welles' speech. I wonder how many Star Trek fans noticed that this dialogue was ripped off by Deep Space Nine writers in the episode Business as Usual, where Quark becomes an arms dealer who faced with the moral dilemma of killing millions for the sake of profit?

For the cinema afficianado, this is one you want to keep and cherish. The casual movie lover needs to view this classic film at least once. I believe it is deserving of as much praise as Casablanca.",1127001600,6,2203,4.508771929824562

678312,5,630347327X,"1. Graham Greene is a brilliant story teller and ""The Third Man"" is a fascinating, beautifully crafted tale that lends itself perfectly to the screen

2. Few actors living or dead can be considered a phenomenon and Orson Wells is certainly one of them. He brings genius and energy to the screen even though his character is absent for most of this film.

3. It must have been a director's dream to be able to film in bombed out, ruined post-war Vienna. It was eerie and fascinating to see this drama played out among the ruins that were quite literally a shadow of the catastrophic war that had preceded it.

4. The music in this film is amazing and I haven't encountered anything like it in any other.

5. I happen to love film-noire (except for Bush's speeches) and ""The Third Man"" is subtle, exquisitely refined film noire.

6. I am also interested in transpersonal psychology, so I always love it when stories mingle personal drama with larger than life events which this one did.

7. From a purely cinematic point of view (I'm no expert, this is just my opinion), this film is beautifully shot with not a single superfluous or disconnected scene.

8. The film contains wonderful ironies including the historical fact that post-war Vienna's International Zone was occupied by joint, British, French, Russian, and American troops (literally one of each in a jeep driving along the ruined streets) who could only communicate with each other in German--the language of their defeated enemy.

9. The characters are not cookie-cutter good guy, bad guy ,police man, and girl. They are flawed and interesting in their own ways which makes them much more believable and fun to watch.

10. I just saw ""Until Sunrise"" a few weeks ago, so it's fun to do mental comparisons between bombed-out, post-war Vienna, and the hip, cool Vienna of the 90's.",1123200000,9,1840,4.779179810725552

If you like this sort of modern movie, you should see this, since it's a classic and in many ways the foundation of the tradition of the spy film. It will also appeal to fans of film noir. As an added bonus, it features a strong and intelligent heroine, ably played by Alida Valli. Unlike the shrinking violets portrayed in many movies (today's as well as old favorites), the female lead here makes her own decisions and resists the ""submissive woman"" and ""damsel in distress"" roles.

678315,5,630347327X,"Probably the greatest location of political intrigue in the 20th Century was post-World War II Vienna.  Occupied by four powers, it attracted spies, con-men, and hustlers of all types and nationalities. This film is set in Vienna at its darkest -- inky cobblestones and black shadows, dark cemeteries and streets turned to rubble, cats slinking about in the night.

I won't repeat the storyline here, as it has been well described in other reviews. I would just add that the plot opens slowly, then peals back, layer by layer.  It never loses your interest.  The effect of having some  characters speak in English and others speak in unsubtitled, untranslated German adds to the mystery.  You are trying to find out what is going on at the same time, and in the same way, as the naive, non-German speaking, American everyman Holly Martins, who cannot fathom the depths of depravity to which his onetime friend has sunk. The music adds to the drama.  This is not the Vienna of Strauss waltzes -- that time has past.  The zither music evokes mystery and loneliness.

As a mystery filmed in black and white, ""The Third Man"" often finds itself on lists of films noir.  It is far better than the typical film noir, in that the cinematography is superior, and the plot is deeper (and not overly melodramatic).  I also appreciate the fact that the ending is not contrived to be happy -- it is definitely not what I expected.

Among many other extras, this DVD contains what is called a ""Graham Greene treatment.""  This consists of portions of the novel ""The Third Man"" read by actor Richard Clarke in lieu of, say, an actor's or director's commentary on the scenes.  I have never seen this done before.  You see the movie, but you hear the story in prose, rather than a screenplay.  It provides a very different take on the same scenes and gives you additional information.  This is well worth watching -- after you've seen the film.

It does not baldly explain everything like a Murder She Wrote episode. However, the tail end of the movie collapsed into chaos I could make no sense of. It was filmed in the dark.

678381,5,630347327X,"Carol Reed directed Graham Greene's script and the result is the sort of film that still shows up on ""greatest movie"" lists 50 years later.

Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin, an American who writes pulpy Westerns. Holly has come to Vienna just at the end of World War II to visit his old friend, Harry Lime. He arrives just in time to hear about Harry's funeral.  Vienna is a city full of rubble and debris from bombing.  It has been divided up into four sectors governed by Americans, British, French and Russians.  The black market fluorishes.

Holly discovers Harry's girlfriend, Anna, played by the enigmatic Valli, and he discovers that Harry was one of the dirtiest and most opportunistic of the black marketeers.

Harry Lime is played by Orson Welles, and the part has as much ""bang for the buck"" as any in cinematic history.  In the accompanying documentary Peter Bogdonovich recalls speaking with Orson Welles and remarking that Harry Lime was one of the great parts of cinematic history.

""Oh, yes"", Welles said.  ""It's a great Mr. Wu part.""

""Mr. Wu?"" Bogdonovich asked.

""Yes, you know - 'you'd better watch out for Mr. Wu.... did you run that by Mr. Wu? Then at the end of the first act you see Mr. Wu in silhouette far away standing on a bridge.  By the time 'Mr. Wu' actually shows up in the film his stature has become so built up in the minds of the audience he is MUCH bigger than life.""

Harry Lime is one of those characters.  This is one of those movies.  The further the story progresses the more layers of deceit and wrongdoing are uncovered.  Feelings are hurt, hearts are broken, innocents are hurt and killed.

This film has several of the most famous scenes of movie history.  Roger Ebert writes that the appearance of Harry Lime is the most famous entrance in cinema.  The ending surprised even the actors.  The ""cuckoo clock"" speech is said to have been improvised by Welles, and it's difficult to think that anything written by Graham Greene could have been improved, but it's impossible to think of the film without this speech.

If you haven't seen it - dive right in.  Go with Holly Martin and Anton Karas' famous zither score.  Fall in love with Anna.  Smile with Harry and take your choice - War and Da Vinci or Peace and the Cuckoo Clock?",1114992000,4,2274,4.571782178217822
678382,5,630347327X,"Into the chaos of postwar Vienna stumbles Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), author of cheap westerns, looking for his old friend Harry Lime. But Lime it appears is dead, in a traffic accident. There's something decidedly fishy about this accident but the British authorities, represented by Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), have little interest in further investigation. They think Lime was a crook they are well rid of. So Martins sets out to investigate for himself. He questions Lime's friends, Kurtz and Popescu (Ernst Deutsch and Siegfried Breuer) who do indeed seem a little sinister as does his doctor (Erich Ponto), Dr Winkel (`vinkel') who `does not have an opinion'. He questions the porter at Line's apartment (Paul Horburger) who may have an opinion but is murdered before he can share it. And he questions Line's lover Anna (Alida Valli) with whom, it seems to him, his friendship might take a romantic turn. He will prove his friend an innocent victim of murder. He will show the authorities how wrong they are. And maybe he will even get the girl.

He will do nothing of the sort. His friend is neither innocent nor murdered. Major Calloway is 100% right. And Anna couldn't care less about him. He's a hopeless patsy, blundering into a situation he doesn't begin to understand and getting desperately out of his depth. While the first half of the film allows the audience to go a little way to sharing Martins' illusions, the second mercilessly strips both him and us of all of them, right up to the devastatingly powerful final shot.

Orson Welles is excellent as the charismatic but poisonous Lime but the inflation of Welles reputation does rather lead to his contribution being overrated. Joseph Cotton was Welles' superior as an actor and Carol Reed, at his best, was something close to Welles' equal as a director. Trevor Howard was seldom better than as the weary but decent Calloway. And as a writer Graham Greene really had no equal, this wonderfully murky, morally complex tale, being the most successful of many attempted translations of his dark imagination to the screen, with its magnificently intelligent and effective dialogue. (The famous `cuckoo clock' speech was of course Welles' own contribution and Greene was not impressed by it.). And then of course there is Anton Karas' zither music score which puts this film into the same category as the likes of `Psycho' and `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and very few others, of films that become utterly inseparable in our minds from their unforgettable musical signatures. Indeed it's almost impossible to fault this gem of a movie. Even the most minor characters, Lime's sinister friends, the benign Tommy Sgt Paine (Bernard Lee), the British propaganda chief (Wilfrid Hyde-White) who mistakes Martins for a serious novelist, Anna's emotional landlady (Hedwig Bleibtreu) are all perfectly realized.",1104192000,13,2878,5.044117647058823
678383,5,630347327X,"Poor Orson Welles. My earliest memories of the man come from the 1970s and early 1980s, roughly the last ten or so years of his life. People told me he once had Hollywood in the palm of his hand, that he was a cinematic genius, and that his tempestuous relationships with the studios ruined his career. An impressive list of information pointing to a powerful man, wouldn't you say? Sadly, I heard these things when Welles was doing wine commercials to make ends meet. ""We'll sell no wine before its time"" doesn't evoke visions of a cinematic genius, that's for sure. Nor did his physical presence impress me all that much. Orson Welles, according to information I have seen, weighed nearly 350 pounds at one point and remained severely obese until the end of his life. I'm not knocking on people with weight problems, but it's just another example of how difficult it was for me to imagine the man as a Hollywood heavyweight (no pun intended). Then I grew up and watched some of his classic films, i.e. ""Touch of Evil,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and the incredibly atmospheric ""The Third Man."" The glowing accolades started making a lot more sense. No wonder filmgoers love this guy's films; they're masterpieces in nearly every way.

""The Third Man"" takes place in the shattered ruins of post-World War II Vienna. Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), an alcoholic hack who bangs out western novels, arrives in town to a mystery greater than anything he ever wrote about. His old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) sent him a letter some time before offering him a job in Vienna, but Martins discovers when he gets there that his pal recently perished in an unfortunate traffic accident. The writer shows up in time to witness Lime's funeral and to meet his buddy's beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli). He also runs afoul of the British occupation force, especially Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), a man who has nothing nice to say at all about Harry Lime. In fact, Calloway insists that Martins leave town immediately, much to the writer's consternation. Fortunately for Holly, a local reading group discovers he is an author and invites him to give a lecture a few days down the road. This gives Martins an excuse to stick around and investigate the increasingly suspicious nature of his old friend's passing. Questions about how the accident unfolded bring conflicting answers from witnesses. Anna Schmidt, who faces a possible expatriation to the Soviet Union's sector of the city, provides few answers to Martins's questions. Something sinister is going on in Vienna, and Holly Martins wants to get to the bottom of it.

I'm not spoiling a thing by saying that Harry Lime never perished in that traffic accident. Why he staged his own passing, and how Holly Martins discovers the ruse, is the central element of ""The Third Man."" It turns out Lime is involved in a particularly loathsome black market scheme, along with several unsavory European characters, that threaten the health of Vienna's children. Calloway shows Martins up close what Lime's handiwork has done to the city's youths. The British have been on Lime's trail for ages, and that is why he doesn't want Holly Martins lurking around Austria. Once the British officer knows that the writer isn't about to condone what his friend is doing, he lets him in on the case and tries to use Martins to bring Lime out of the woodwork. There are only two things complicating the search for Harry Lime: Martins falls in love with Anna Schmidt and Lime is one slick operator who isn't about to go down without a fight. When the two old friends finally meet on a Ferris wheel, the encounter turns into a memorable exposition on the merits of right and wrong. Despite Lime's blithe belief in what he's doing for a buck, his time is about to run out. Holly Martins can't save his friend even as he cannot convince Anna to give up her love for Harry. The two sequences at the end of the film, the sewer chase and the funeral scene, will stay you with for eons.

What's not to like about this movie? Try as I might, I can't think of anything I would want to see changed. The performances are magisterial, the dialogue transcendent, and the set pieces perfectly match the sordid storyline. Repeatedly, memorable scenes march across the screen. The shadow of the guy with the balloons looming on the buildings, the vividness of the wet cobblestones in the nighttime street scenes, and the hunted look on Harry Lime's face as the authorities corner him in the sewer like the rat he is all stick in the memory banks with the tenacity of molasses. Just as memorable is Anton Karas's zither score, an odd choice for a noir film yet a tune that fits the story perfectly and will have you humming for weeks afterwards. The question I ought to ask should go something like this: what I can say about this marvelous picture that hasn't been said by others a million times before? No one with an ounce of appreciation for the cinematic form, regardless of their personal favorites, can deny the beauty and power of this film.

Criterion goes above and beyond the call of duty with their DVD version of the film. Supplements are plentiful and lengthy: an alternate opening voice narration track, footage of Anton Karas playing the movie's theme on his famous zither, a short documentary about how the Viennese police patrol their extensive sewer system, an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, episodes from Welles's Harry Lime radio show, and much more. The picture quality looks great, the sound quality is very nice, and the movie is a masterpiece. Don't wait as long as I did to see this phenomenal picture; it's every bit as good as you've heard.",1103500800,24,5684,4.76751269035533
678384,5,630347327X,"The Third Man begins as a mystery story about Holly Martins's search for answers when his best friend Harry Lime is killed in an alleged traffic accident days before they were to be reunited after many years spent apart. Holly quickly discovers a number of inconsistencies in the reported events of Lime's death. Intrigued by these clues Holly senses a deeper conspiracy at work and refuses to return to the US at the request of the local law enforcement, Major Calloway. Calloway also describes Lime to Holly as a major bootlegger and murderer, adding to Cotton's desire to learn the truth about his friend he considered incapable of the atrocities alleged by Calloway. Lime's girlfriend Anna Schmidt assures Cotton that Calloway is lying.

The story takes place in post-WWII Vienna, a bombed out shell of a city that has been divided into 4 quarters, each governed by either America, France, England, or Russia. The film was shot entirely on location, a choice the director had to battle intensely with the studio over. This was critically important to the entire character of the film, and is a rare documentation of the true destruction in Europe in a post war Hollywood film. The beleaguered city surrounds the characters in the film and adds to the depth of our understanding of them.

The black and white cinematography and style of this film might remind the viewer of Citizen Kane. However I felt no similarity between the two films other than that they are both excellent films in their own way that take full advantage of the focus and shading available when shooting in black and white instead of color.

Some call Orson Welles' mysterious entrance in The Third Man the greatest in all of film. I agree it is quite clever, but it failed to evoke a strong sense of drama in me personally. My sense of the scene was more of anticlimax, the viewer is expecting this to happen eventually, and the surprise is mild at best. Still, Welles' performance in The Third Man is easily equal to that of Citizen Kane, despite being a significantly smaller role. The true nature of Welles' character is never fully revealed, the viewer must draw their own conclusions from his brief appearances from the shadowy underworld he inhabits.

Holly is something of a mirror image of Lime. In America Holly is a writer of pulp mystery and western novels and is well known even in Europe. Holly represents the innocence and relative naivet of America in his misunderstanding of the conflicting interests Lime and so many others in Europe surely faced both during and after the war. Holly's sad realization that his best friend since childhood was capable of such horrible actions surely changes him forever. Did the war bring out these actions, or were they lurking hidden from view all along? The conclusion of The Third Man is decidedly not a happy formula Hollywood ending, as the studio desired.",1101859200,7,2888,4.828282828282828

Carol Reed directed a very Citizen Kane like film in the ruins of 1946 Austria.  Everyone will recognize the unusual film angles, scene cuts, and black and white shadows as Orwellian.  However, I'm taking nothing away from Reed.  This film is as good a European Film Noir as you'll find.  The film glides effortlessly till the ending in the sewers under Vienna.

Cotton plays the naive American that arrives in Vienna to take up a job with a flamboyant, immoral, schoolboy friend, Harry Lime (Welles).  However, Harry Lime in reality is running a black market scheme in stolen penicillin, which results in the death of hundreds of innocents.  Cotton learns Harry has been killed in a suspicious car crash.  Cotton then runs into Trevor Howard, a British Military, Lime's girlfriend, actress Alida Valli, and assorted suspicious characters.  Nothing is what it seems and Cotton is soon involved in international intrigue.  A mandolin plays in the background and it's very unsettling.

Do you think that anyone will want to watch ""Kill Bill"" in 55 years?  I don't even want to watch it now.  The Third Man was made in Vienna at the end of WWII .. so much is clear from the date of the movie, and the very realness of the bombed out city within which the story is set.  The horrible effects of war are seen both in the surroundings, and within the dark hearts of the racketeers.  I'm so grateful that this movie has never been ""colored up"" because that would have taken away the wonderful use of shadows and light.  There are so many truly awesome moments - pick your own! - which just wouldn't be the same in color.  I'm thinking of the doorstep scene, when the cat finds Harry, and his smug little smile is highlighted by the light coming from an opened window.  And, my favorite ever movie scene, in the last quarter of the movie, where Holly is waiting in the cafe to betray Harry, and he steps out on the roof top above.  There is something about the way that Welles moves, and the interplay of shadow and light, that is just beautiful.
The actors are all magnificent.  Welles' Harry Lime is a cynical, uncaring horror - a very ""dirty"" Harry indeed (pun intended!)  Joseph Cottens as Holly Martins starts out naive and foolish, a total buffoon and innocent, who falls in love with Welles' mistress overnight, but he soon hardens as the full magnitude of his friend's crimes become clear to him.  Trevor Howard is the (stereo)typically English Major Calloway.  (When Holly addresses him as ""Callaghan"", he brusquely corrects him and barks that ""I'm not Irish"" .. lol!)  There are such wonderful moments in the script.  Not just Welles' cuckoo clock speech, but moments such as the one where Anna, Harry Limes' beautiful Czechoslovakian girlfriend is arrested for possible deportation to Russia, she says sadly ""Sometimes he said I laughed too much.""  That line, so beautifully delivered, always brings a tear to my eye.

I loved this cleaned up DVD.  There were subtitles - very necessary in my household, and the zither music was as clear as day (a little bit too clear at times in fact).  A very necessary purchase for anyone who appreciates a bloodless, yet deeply thrilling mystery classic.",1087516800,3,2390,4.581176470588235
678431,5,630347327X,"Orson Wells got top billing in this Vienna thriller from 1949... but make no mistake, this is Joseph Cotton's movie. Cotton plays Holly Martins, the long time American friend of Orson Wells' character, Harry Lime. Martins shows up in Vienna and ends up attending Lime's so-called funeral. Quickly, everyone in the cast seems suspicious. Martins starts asking questions to several people who witnessed the truck accident that supposedly took Lime's life. When the stories don't match, Martins decides to spend a little more time in Vienna to investigate. Along the way he meets the beautiful Anna Schmidt (played by Alida Valli) and falls for her. As the police and neighbors try to get Martins out of town... Martins sees Harry Lime alive and well in the shadowy streets. As quick as he can blink, Harry disappears and the chase is off thru the beautiful streets of Vienna. The climax comes when the chase goes down into the sewers underground with Martins and a whole squad of police chasing Harry down. This is a film Hitchcock would have loved to have his name on. This black & white film is beautifully shot... lighting, intense shadows, old classic European architecture in the background, a larger than life ferris wheel, great cast, great acting... and a movie filled with suspense, love, and a whole lot of deception. Cotton is superb throughout. Wells doesn't show up until you're well into the 2nd half of the movie. The 1941 classic ""Citizen Kane"", or ""A Touch Of Evil"", or maybe ""The Stanger"" are better films featuring Orson Wells... but, Wells has such a huge presence on the screen that he steals the show almost every time. As good as Wells is here, I still believe Cotton's performance is equally on par with Wells. Look for Cotton in other classics like ""Deul In The Sun"" (with Jennifer Jones), ""Niagara"" (with Marilyn Monroe), ""Othello"" (with Wells), ""Soylent Green"" (with Charlton Heston), and as one of the main characters with Wells in ""Citizen Kane"".

678433,5,630347327X,"Ranked 57 on American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films, The Third Man is a murder mystery with a twist from 1949.
Set in post-WW2 Vienna, the story involves an American arriving in the city expecting to begin a job found for him by his best friend. He soon discovers that his friend, Harry Lime, has disappeared, presumed dead, in suspicious circumstances. Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) makes it his new agenda to find out what has happened to his friend, and is lead down wrong paths by the police captain, Lime's underworld connections, and Lime's partner, Anna Schmidt.
This film is considered a classic for the way it uses shadow and sets to create suspense. Anton Karas creates the tense atmosphere with his famous zither score. The film won an Academy Award in 1951 for Best Cinematography, and this is best shown in the climatic sewer scenes.
Orson Welles owns this film in the brief time he is on screen, hardly speaking but always commanding in his role.
A masterful thriller, and director Carol Reed's greatest work, The Third Man deserves a place alongside the best of Alfred Hitchcock, and a place in any DVD collection.
The DVD itself is outstanding! The Criterion Collection strives for perfection when it comes to restoring old films, and this disc is no exception. The video has never looked better, and the audio, while presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono-soundtrack (basically, the sounds come from one speaker), is sufficient and makes Karas' score that much better. The DVD contains ample extras, a satisfactory amount for a film over 50 years old. Included are such features as a photo gallery from oringinal production, trailers from both 1949 and the 1999 cinema re-release, and a short interview with assistant director Guy Hamilton.",1074816000,5,1781,4.959866220735786
678434,4,630347327X,"The Third Man, a thriller set in post-World War II Vienna, has been lauded as one of the best movies of all time, and Orson Welles's performance in the movie, which is largely confined to the last 15 minutes, is certainly great.  Watching the movie more than a half century after it was produced, it seemed well-crafted, but dated.  The techniques might have been innovative when released, but they were now familiar.  One effect though that retained its power was the mysterious zither music running through the movie.
 What I really liked about the movie was its story and the moral choice it presented. (Spoilers below) The main character (Holly Martins) must decide whether to support and protect an old friend out of loyalty or to turn the friend in to the police once he discovers the depraved actions the friend has taken.  Martins considers refusing to help the police, but in the end decides to help capture his friend at some risk to himself.
 This behavior is contrasted with the friend's (former) girlfriend, who remains loyal to him, even though he has faked his death and left her grieving and at risk of being deported to communist controlled Eastern Europe.  She not only refuses to cooperate with the police but attempts to protect him from capture.
 The contrast in the way that these two characters respond to the friend is what gives the movie its power, and Wells plays the friend to perfection - portraying a person who could produce such strong attachments and yet be so despicable.",1074038400,8,1505,4.783783783783784

678436,3,630347327X,"I recently went on a movie watching spree to cover the AFI top 100 Movies where 'The 3rd Man' had come in at #57. I didn't want to miss this eventhough this was waaay behind my time and I was afraid that I wouldn't find it captivating. I was sad to see that my fears were justified.
To be frank, if I had put myself in a theater during 1949 watching Orson Welles and Joe Cotten doing their landmark performances, I would have held onto my seat for dear life during the rollercoaster ride. But being at the age that I am and seeing the tempo in the movies increasing to a dizzying level in this era, I found this a bit too slow and bland. I had to force myself thru the most part of it. That's the bad news. I know I am partly to blame for it.
Now for the good news - As I said, it is amazing that such a movie was made so way back in time. Orson Welles turns in what he himself refers to as the 'star performance'. Trevor Howard is very good too. This is the quinessential thriller set in post-war Vienna laden with love, deception & murder. Anyone who want to be catapulted back into those times and get the 'feel' would have what the doctor ordered.
To summarize, don't expect a lot of fast and furious action. Maybe not even a great deal of suspense because I could pretty much predict things along the way. Just pretend that you're in the fourties and maybe you'll have a good time.
Now to the DVD features - the picture as such was restored to perfection, no white noise and no grains. Good ! But there was little else in there to catch one's fancy. Guess there wasn't  anyone surviving from the days of the yore to hash together an 'Interview with the cast' or the 'Making of The Third Man'. Too Bad ! There was this feature called 'Restoration Implementation' which showed a lot of blurry moving images which didn't make any sense to me. What the heck ?? My hopes of maybe seeing technology in action in restoring an ailing print to a new found glory was shattered. There was nothing of that sort in there!

In addition, Welles wrote (with Graham Green's permission) his famous speech at the amusement park. That scene alone is worth the price of the DVD. The Criterion DVD is definitive - do not get the cheaper versions!",1061942400,,528,4.688172043010753
678438,5,630347327X,"The Third Man is, unquestionably, one of the greatest films of all time. It is probably the greatest British film of all too. Based on a screenplay by Graham Greene, set amidst the rubble of post-war Vienna and starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten and Trevor Howard, this one was always going to be good. It was, for many years, regarded as the film noir to beat all others and is my favourite movie. Radical in it's cinematic concept and brilliantly shot by Robert Krasker, the film has more atmosphere than any film I have seen before or since.
It all starts with Holly Martins (Cotten), a drunkard who writes the type of books which used to be known as ""penny dreadfuls"", arriving in Vienna not long after the end of WWII on the promise of a job. It turns out that his prospective employer, Harry Lime (Welles), has been killed in an accident and Martins has arrived just in time for the funeral. Lime's friends soon make contact with the wayward Martins, who becomes convinced that his friend has been murdered, and eventually through a series of encounters, he winds up in the hands of the Military Police.
In the opinion of this reviewer, this is Cotten's best film and though I've never been a big fan of his, he suits the role admirably. I also believe this is Trevor Howard's finest performance. So good is Howard that there is little doubt over his conviction that Martins is wrong and the scene where all is revealled to him is a feature of the film. Orson Welles was an acting giant in anyone's terms although by this time he was almost universally regarded as box office poison. His characterisation of the psychopathic Lime has been the model for so many film baddies and in may ways is as sinister as Hannibal Lecter.
The cinematography is superb. Shot on the streets of bombed-out Vienna and using minimal lighting, it gives definition to the film noir genre. The lighting reflected off wet cobblestone roads and the hard shadows created by single brute arcs create a cold, stark landscape for Carol Reed's direction and the underlying suspense of the plot. Much of the film; certainly the majority of the interiors as well as nearly all the sewer scenes, were actually shot in studio in the UK but all the location stuff is real, so much so that you can even do a ""Third Man"" tour if you are in Vienna.
The Criterion transfer is the sharpest B&W I have ever seen and rather than being merely technically precise, really adds to the atmosphere of the film. There was an enormous number of repairs made to the original print (something like 22,000, if my memory serves me correctly) and the ultimate product is almost seemless and has a beautiful grey scale. There are a few added features, including a rather comical short of Anton Karas playing the famous theme on his zither in a London club. Karas, incidentally, a Gypsy who could not read music, was first spotted in a seedy Vienna nightclub and contracted to do the film more-or-less on the spot. It is extraordinary how much the zither adds to the film.
Reckoned by many to be the finest suspense film ever made and containing more cinematic innovation than almost anything which came afterward it, until the arrival of the French New Wave, this film wants for nothing. The acting performances are top notch, the pictures are beautiful and the plot is terrific. There is even a little wry humour at the expense of Viennese society. A cinematic gem not to be missed and essential to any serious film buff's library.",1059264000,9,3486,4.642394822006472

The movies strange off-angle camera shots, the way the plot twists and shifts who is covering up what and why is simply wonderful.  It is one of those rare movies that absolutely convinces you it is one kind of movie and ends up being another.
The always commented upon zither music does contribute mightily to the atmosphere of the film.  So does the untranslated German used throughout the film.  The palpable tension between the occupied Germans, the communists, and the allies is done better here than almost anywhere else.  I think it helps that the film was done at the time all the post WWII occupation was actually happening and still new.
Orson Welles, Jospeh Cotten, Alia Valli, Trevor Howard, and all the rest are wonderful.  And the way Criterion has done the transfer is magnificent.

678488,4,630347327X,"Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), a writer of pulp Westerns, arrives in Vienna expecting to meet his childhood friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When he arrives, Lime is not there to greet him. Apparently, Lime was accidently killed after being hit by a car, and their meeting is at his funeral. The one discrepancy that bothers Martins is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness claims not only was Lime killed instantly, but another man--a third man--helped carry him. Martins, curious of the accident, begins to investigate and hears contradictary stories about the circumstances surrounding Limes death.

Exactly how did Harry Lime die? That question is the engine driving the plot. The film constructs a picture of Lime through the comments of all those who knew him. Martins remembers Lime as a loyal friend. Lime had a girlfriend named Anna (Alida Valli), who speaks very highly of him. After all, he was the man she loved, and apparently still does. Annas unquestioning devotion paints the picture of Lime as a romantic. There is obviously something likeable about him, given the attitude Anna has for him and the way the tenants in the rooming house feel, but Calloway (Trevor Howard), the British officer in charge, says Lime was an evil man and advises Holly to take the next train home. He shows Martins the effects of Limes work in a hospital full of children dying from the watered-down vaccines that were part of the dead mans business enterprise.

The film impeccably freezes in our imaginations images of post-war Europe in general and Vienna in particular. And anyone who has seen this will discover scene after scene emblazoned in his or her memory. Indeed, this film is a succession of stunning images and scenes: the first time we see Harry Lime (Orson Welles), lurking in the shadows of a doorway, hands in pockets, an ambiguous, almost apologetic yet amused smile. The Ferris wheel towering over Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) as he waits to meet Harry Lime. The extraordinary ""Cuckoo Clock"" speech that Harry delivers as he and Holly ride the Ferris Wheel high above the ""ants"" below. The chase through the sewers. The unforgettable as Anna Schmidt (Valli) walks towards and then past Holly as Anton Karas plays utterly unforgettable zither piece known today as ""The Third Man"" theme.
An enormous amount of great talent was involved in this picture, and nearly all were at the height of their powers. Graham Greene produced one of the great scripts the movies has seen, about an hack writer who has arrived in post-war Vienna to take a job that has been offered him by his old friend Harry Lime, only to discover that he has died in a car wreck. In talking with various friends, the friend, Holly Martins, discovers that the various stories told about Lime don't quite mesh with one another. The climax of the movie comes when Holly learns that Harry not only didn't die but also is making a fortune on the black market. Joseph Cottons turned in perhaps the finest performance in his career as the good natured, but always-one-step-behind Holly Martins. Orson Welles was never better as an actor than he was in this film as the enigmatic Harry Lime, managing to be both thoroughly charismatic and completely reprehensible at the same time. Trevor Howard was as solid as always as Harry Lime's nemesis Major Calloway. Many, many of the minor characters turn in memorable performances. Today, Carol Reed is not well remembered in the United States. This is unfortunate, because he was a truly first rate director with many very fine movies to his credit (among which I do not include the hard-to-take OLIVER). Part of the reason for this has been the widespread influence of French auteur criticism, which pretty much tarred all British cinema with the same inconceivably broad brush, excepting perhaps only the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. As much as I enjoy the work of the latter (jointly known as ""The Archers""), I believe that Carol Reed is not as appreciated as he deserves. This film certainly is highly regarded, but he left behind many, many other superb films that also deserve continued viewing. At any rate, regardless of the amount of attention his work as a whole received, this film incontestably remains one of the truly great films in the history of cinema.",1053907200,4,3011,4.837209302325581

So I have a hard time reading the reviews which say that this film is ""so-so"" or just plain bad.  ""The Third Man"" was on many a list of the best films of the 20th Century and deservedly so.  I will admit that Joseph Cotten's acting is a little stiff by today's standards, but Welles' performance more than compensates for it.  The suspense leading up to his appearance is palpable.  Perhaps Harry Lime isn't the most evil arch villain ever filmed (a claim that's a more than a little overblown, given the film's immediate post-war/pre-Cold War setting) but his cynicism and complete lack of sympathy for his victims are both timely and very disturbing. Lime is, at best, a morally ambiguous character.  But audiences found him so interesting that ""The Third Man"" was given its own radio show, two episodes of which are contained on the DVD.
The DVD itself contains a lot of other great extras like newsreel footage of the Vienna police detail charged with patrolling the sewers made famous by the film.  Incidentally, if you like that scene, you might also enjoy Anthony Mann's ""He Walked by Night.""  This similarity leads me to my final point in defense of ""The Third Man.""  A lot of people say they don't like old films.  This may be because they've seen their key elements reused too often and too poorly in later movies.

To tell a little, it seems at first that Lime has been killed in a car accident, but martins learns more about the dark side of his friend and the truth of his dissapearance as the story goes on.
The film's score, by Anton Karas on the Zither, is haunting and memorable. The crass producers of ""xXx"" even use it in their disasterous film.

When I finally had an opportunity to watch The Third Man, I was prepared to be delighted, having heard so many good things about the movie.  Unfortunately, I found the movie to be just okay and far from spectacular.
There were three essential flaws in this film. For one thing, Joseph Cotten, the hero of the story, is basically unlikable and his motivation to find the killer of his friend Harry Lime hardly is enough to motivate the viewer to care.  Secondly, the musical score is not only the same basic tune throughout the movie, it has no relation to the mood of the scene and in fact, its light tone often contradicts the seriousness of the scene.  Finally, this is a movie that is overdirected, with some shots at strange angles for no special reason.  Probably Carol Reed's direction is in fact the main flaw that is responsible for the other two.
The story itself is okay, written by Graham Greene who adapted it from his own novel.  Some of the scenes do look nice and the look of postwar Vienna is appropriately glum. Nonetheless, this seems like someone trying to make a Hitchcock movie without really succeeding.  Perhaps in some alternate universe, Hitchcock did direct this movie and it turned out well; in this universe, however, we must settle for this one.",1036972800,5,1350,4.670886075949367

In ""The Third Man,"" the city of Vienna is literally broken up into quarters (British, French, American, Russian), but it is also visually so. Distortion is produced through tilting of the camera lens and the expressive use of lighting. The first appearance of Harry Lime is one example, where we view only a disembodied shoe, the brief glimpse of an enigmatic face, and an attenuated shadow. The jaunty zither music further exacerbates the disorientation. The iconic ferris wheel is a fairly obvious reference to the incongruities of fate (with its ups and downs), while the subtle reference to Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" confirms the film's insistence on the impossibility of telling a coherent narrative. Harry Lime's demise in the city's sewers mimicks Kurtz's anticlimactic dispatch in ""Heart of Darkness"" - death is no heroic enterprise, nor is it cathartic; but rather, pathetic and entropic. There are no heroes in ""The Third Man,"" because the possibility of heroism is specifically precluded; people do not transcend the modern landscape, but rather endure it with a kind of fatalistic opportunism.
Unforgettable.",1035676800,2,1379,5.2727272727272725
678550,5,630347327X,"I'm not one to rave about ""glorious black and white"" cinematography.  Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (although NOT colorized).  However, there are exceptions.  Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the ""Movietone"" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium.  And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white.  It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color.  Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.
It's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII.  The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops.  There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market.  Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote.  And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect.  From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.
But The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody.  The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around.  The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling.  The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.
This is a great film because almost everything was done right.  The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches.  I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen.  Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.
This is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there.  But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil.  Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own.  It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end.  But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe.  There is in this film no compromise with that truth.
See this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.",1031184000,9,4281,4.710455764075067

678553,5,630347327X,"Adapted from Graham Greene's book which was written with a film in mind, Carol Reed did a masterful job of directing this 1949 film which won Academy Awards for film editing, black and white photography, and directing.  It's a bit of a masterpiece and holds the viewer in a suspended state of suspense, heightening the tensions as it moves swiftly along.
Starring Joseph Cotton as Holly Martin, an American who comes to Vienna at the request of an old college chum, Harry Lime, played by Orson Wells, the scene is set for intrigue from the very beginning.  Martins is immediately told that Harry Lime has been killed in an accident and that his funeral is in progress.  The plot thickens as he encounters a British policeman and learns that Harry might not have been such a nice guy after all.  Martin suspects murder and goes about investigating on his own, finding himself attracted to Lime's girlfriend, played by Alida Valli.
Orson Wells doesn't appear until more than half the film is over, and only appears in three major scenes.  But these scenes will be remembered forever especially the one where he and Joseph Cotton confront each other on a moving Ferris Wheel.
Wells and Cotton are the stars of this film but the there's another star as well. And that's the City of Vienna in all its wartime devastation.  There is real rubble everywhere and the oblique angled shots, distorted wide angles and stark black and white photography create a surreal and bleak landscape.  And then there is the haunting original zither music by Anton Karas, which became a top hit in 1950.
I recently read the book by Graham Greene and therefore knew the plot.  In a way this spoiled the suspense for me.  Freed from that however, I was able to concentrate on the details of the directional techniques and the cinematography.  There's no doubt about it.  This film is a winner.",1025827200,6,1867,4.731481481481482

Masterful work by director Carol Reed.

The mood, the music, the cast...all of it combines to form a rare jewel of cinema.  It is easily one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen.
Joseph Cotton is a captivating Film Noir leading man.  Cynical and easy-going, he glides through the film like an old pro.  However, he is not bitter and heartless, Philip Marlow style.  Part of the tender charm of ""The Third Man"" is the humanness of the characters when confronted with inhumanity.  Truly, Orson Welles steals the show in his brief appearances as Harry Lime.  The zither music lends an unreal quality to the production, and shows just how important sound is to a film.
The Criterion DVD presentation is something in itself.  Picture, audio are both top-notch.  The addition of the Lux Theater broadcasts are very cool indeed.  It really says something about Welles's performance as Harry Lime, that he inspired the Radio adventures of the character.

Okay, so maybe this film isn't completely forgotten, but I
have a buddy who cried bloody murder when he heard the
American Film Institute ranked it in the forties on their
list of all time movies, and I have to agree with him. In
the shadow of Welles's own directorial efforts, 'The Third
Man', sits sometimes like a red-headed stepchild.
It's no small trick making a movie that is quaint, charming,
dramatic, and utterly perfect all at the same time.  Writer
Graham Greene provided the film that first quality, Orson
Welles the second, and Sir Carol Reed the third. As for
being utterly perfect, who or what in the heck can ever

Yet this film is also very political playing on the rivalry between the western allies and the soviets who jointly occupy the city. The immoral businessmen use this rivalry to navigate freely in the city. Yet the International police and the austrian police will find out the truth and will bait and catch the main ringleader. The question asked in the film is a comparison between the Borggias who produced the Renaissance with intrigue, plot and blood, on one hand, and brotherly democratic Switzerland that produced only the cuckoo-clock, on the other hand. Which one is better ? The question is not answered in the film because we are big enough to make up our minds alone. Let say that the ending is moral.

678668,5,630347327X,"The Third Man is one of the most satisfying movies I've ever seen. I felt that way about it when I first saw it on a muddy tape, and over the years I've seen it a few times and loved it just the same -- but it took this DVD to make me realize what the movie really looked like.
There never really was a good tape version of Third Man. The visual sludge on the last tape copy I tried was enough to make me cringe just watching it. The first accomplishment of this disk is that it brings the images back. Like the new DVD of Citizen Kane, The Third Man is dazzlingly well-restored. Every brick in those Vienna streets is sharply defined, every nuance of lighting and focus is there in a way none of my tapes came close to. After seeing this disc, I realized I'd always loved the story enough to live with awful copies. Bam! This has that visual crispness that you love in a great DVD. You appreciate Carol Reed's eye even more once you've seen the movie as he intended it.
Don't even get me started on the extras. How about radio dramas in which Orson Welles plays Harry Lime in a slightly different character vein? The short story form of The Third Man, as written by Graham Greene, was really only a sort of developmental project for the movie -- and it's included here. We get another radio version, this complete, with Joseph Cotten performing the whole thing. There's some newsreel footage of the real Vienna sewer patrols who show up in the film's final sequence. The commentary soundtrack is very decent. In short, Criterion understands what makes you come back to a DVD and see it again; they get it. Want to see Anton Karas playing his zither at a party? You got it. This isn't just ""We added the trailer,"" see?
I'm not a film student, and I wouldn't know where to start in saying how wonderful this movie is. Maybe you can read the rest of the reviews here, if you haven't seen the thing, and get a sense of what the experts think. All I can say is, this is an intelligent, complex, satisfying movie, acted superbly. It evokes history in a genuine way. It respects you -- it knows it doesn't have to pander, to spell everything out.

""The Third Man"" is both a brilliant achievement from the standpoint of superb black and white photography, with an Oscar being won in that category by cameraman Robert Krasker,and in dramatic storytelling with British fiction great Graham Greene delivering the premier screenplay of his notable career.
The film captures the dark and suspicious Vienna underworld by night during the black market and rationing period following World War Two.  American Holly Martens, played with an appropriate bumbling innocence by normally suave Joseph Cotten, leaves his middle class existence as a pulp fiction writer of westerns to fly to Vienna after an invitation from his longstanding friend, Harry Lime, played with a colorful ruthlessness by Orson Welles, to join him in a business enterprise.
The film's first shock occurs at the beginning of ""The Third Man,"" when Cotten is informed on arrival that Welles has been killed after being accidentally hit by a car.  Cotten is suspicious from the beginning.  His skepticism accelerates after talking to Welles' girlfriend, played with a sexy nonchalance by Alida Valli.  Eventually he learns that Welles is very much alive.  His anything but surefooted detective activities cause concern for British Army captain Trevor Howard, who fears that Cotten will be killed by Welles or another operative in his syndicate, which specializes in stealing penicillin, dilluting it, then selling it at enormous profits to hospitals.
""The Third Man"" exudes effortless suspense from the opening scene up to the film's dramatic end.  British director Carol Reed was at the peak of his career when he did ""The Third Man.""

678672,5,630347327X,"After hearing so many great things about this movie, I decided one day to take the initiative and buy the Criterion Collection DVD of The Third Man. Since I hadn't seen the movie before (Except for clips on the AFI's broadcast of the most thrilling movies), some might call this a mistake. I call it a good, though not wise, investment.
Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) goes to Post World War II Vienna to visit his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). After he arrives, however, he finds that Harry had been killed a few days before. Holly investigates into Harry's death, only to find himself entrapped in murder, racketeering and visits of friends from beyond the grave. He also finds that he has fallen in love with Lime's ex-girl Anna (Alida Valli).
The Third Man is a rare perfect marriage of performances, cinematography and music. Cotten is excellent in his role as Martins, while the rest of the supporting cast (Especially Valli as Lime's ex-girlfriend and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway) are just as good. The Oscar winning cinematography of Robert Krasker is superb in the way it brings to life the darkness of Vienna. It brings a sense of depth and realism to the movie. A viewer feels like putting their hand on screen and touching the water soaked walls. Could a similar feeling have been reproduced if the whole movie was filmed on soundstages? But what the movie is probably best known for is Anton Karas's Zither score. The themes of it are difficult to explain. Sometimes the music is happy and cheerful and other times we feel a sense of sorrow. Some thought of it as a mistake that the music of the entire movie should be done with one instrument. Today, it's unthinkable without it.
Criterion has always been known for their quality and they don't disappoint with The Third Man. The picture has been digitally restored to where it looks as new as anything being made today. It might possibly be newer. The sound is perfectly clear. In fact you'll be adjusting the volume to lower the sound. The supplements are also excellent. First, there is a restoration demonstration, which will make one appreciate much more how much care Criterion put into this movie. Then there is vintage newsreel footage of the Vienna Sewer Police as they perform their duties in the film's famous sewer location and footage of Anton Karas performing ""The Third Man theme"" at a club (Reportedly in the same way he was found by director Carol Reed). There are production notes that cover many aspects of filming the movie and have some interesting trivia. There is also an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich and an alternate opening voice over for the American release. The main extra highlights though are two radio broadcasts: Orson Welle's presenting ""A Ticket to Tangiers"" from The Lives of Harry Lime and a radio presentation of The Third Man.
Criterion has overall made an excellent DVD and should be applauded for it. Buy it, watch it, cherish it and listen to Welles' famous speech:
""In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""",1006041600,20,3289,4.823008849557522

Holly Martins (Cotten) is called to the city to attend his beloved friend Harry Lime's (Welles) funeral while he plans for his visit to be short he finds things aren't as they seem and Harry may not be dead and Martins also falls for Harry's lover played by Valdi. The camera angles are constantly changing giving the viewer a feeling of unbalance and unease. The acting is perfection Cotton is perfect as Harry Lime. The director Reed, wanted James Stewart but thank god Sleznick wanted Cotton. Stewart's everyman looks and drawl voice would have slowed the pace of the film greatly. Instead Cotten gives Martins a snide and swarmy appeal and in the end you never question why Cotten's Character befriended Welles' Lime. Because Martins'(Cotten) has a little of Lime's (Welles) persona in him. Valli is brilliant in her role as Anna Schmidt. She is both distant and lonely for her departed lover and will always love the man she thought Lime was instead of the monster that he is. Welles is brilliant! When we first see him in the building's foyer he smiles like only Wellels can. Like he knows something we never will it's not a smurk but a hint of evil lurks behind his eyes and cherub face. This film is mesmerizing!  Watch how Anna just goes through Lime's apartment knowing where everything is without even looking down to find what she is looking for-even though she just told the authorities she's never been there.

However, Orson Welles is all anyone remembers, or rather he is the first thing people remember about this classic film.  Released in England in 1949, ""The Third Man"" didn't open in the US until the following year.  Too bad.  It would easily have been the best picture of 1949 - possibly winning the Oscar over ""All the King's Men.""  But, no.  It came up against ""All About Eve"" and ""Sunset Blvd"" - and wasn't even nominated for best picture of 1950 (neither were ""The Asphalt Jungle"" or ""Panic in the Streets"").

678751,5,630347327X,"A classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post WWll Vienna, ""The Third Man,"" directed by Carol Reed, stars Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles.  Looking for work, American pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins (Cotton) arrives in Vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend, Harry Lime (Welles), who he has not seen in many years.  But Martins is greeted at his hotel-- not by Lime, as he had expected-- but with the news that Lime is dead, having been hit by a truck two days earlier.  Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).  Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market.  Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him.
 In talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day.  And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him.  So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words.  A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene.  And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man.
 Working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering.  The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement.  And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film.  Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black & white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.
 Cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops.  And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there.  When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained.  Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers.  His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.
 Cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that ""regular guy"" persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life.  The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established.  Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly.  Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly.  It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.
 The supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin).  Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, ""The Third Man"" is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level.  The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice.  In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector.",988416000,10,5149,5.040094339622642

When he discovers that Harry is dead,he decides to investigate his death and uncovers some unusual truths about Harry Lime. On the DVD intro,Peter Bogdanovich says a remarkable thing about this movie is the coming together of some really top talents all
working at their best. And you'd have to agree. The script and direction are excellent. Joe Cotten is superb as Holly Martins, Trevor Howard steals every scene he's in as the wonderfully cynical Major Calloway. Even supporting players like Bernard Lee and Wilfrid Hyde White give wonderful performances. But the star of the show has to be Orson Welles. He dominates the movie and gives the best performance of a great career. The ferris Wheel scene and the cat in the doorway scene(Both with Welles) are quite rightly classics. My favourite scene in the movie is when Holly tells Harry's girlfriend Anna(Alida Valli) that ""I wouldn't stand a chance,would I?"" and a single tear falls down the path of her cheek.

It's a quirky piece, possibly the best film ever made by Carol Reed.  The dialogue is fast and furious, so pay attention or you'll miss things.

1st: The zither music...- i even downloaded it on Napster!

That is a classic scene...especially the way Welles looks at Cotten! it's so great.
3rd: the plot. It's really suspenseful!  The whole sewers scene is wonderful.

678934,5,630347327X,"There are many films considered ""great.""  Most of these are ""great"" in one way or another; a few in many ways (Orson Wells ""Citizen Kane"" comes to mind), but few are great in EVERY way. Carol Reed's ""The Third Man""  is one of these.
The story:  A true mystery.  Not just is the typical sense of a 'who done it?', but in a deeper psychological sense of WHY? Are the Military Police hounding an innocent man? If so, why?  Was the crime actually commited? If so, why?  The film not only askes these questions, but it makes the audience yearn to know the answers.
The script: From it first voice over introduction to it's voiceless end sequence The Third Man demonstrates brilliant screen writing.  The dialog is real, but it is more.  For one thing it is funny.  Not just 'fuuny' in the sense of comic lines, but in subtle ways; in the playful use of words and in the interesting juxtaposition of those words with their accompanying  images. (This aspect alone makes The Third Man a film to see again and again.)  Without revealing the story line, let it simply be said that Orson Well's impromptu lines about the ""cookoo clock"" will echo in your brain for hours, weeks, maybe even years, after having heard them.
The cinematography:  Reed was criticized for his use of unusual camera angles.  Word is that he was so stung by that criticism that he never used them again.  Those critics must be in purgatory for that sin!  Those camera angles, working along with dynamicly constucted patterns of light and shadow, are no mear gimmick. They communicate  the charactor's state of mind  thud allowing  a wonderful econmomy of dialog.  Brilliant!
Symbolism:  The Third Man can be thoroughly enjoyed as a simple mystery film.  But look a little deeper into the images and it becomes much more.  Again, without revealing anything about the plot: study the sequence on the Ferris Wheel. Compare  what is being revealed by the dialog (some of which may at first appear to be mere banter) with the motion of the car. Notice how a small spoken revelation at the ride's apex changes the charactor's life from heaven to a decent into hell.  That timing was no accident; it is Master filmaking. Does Reeds 'film theology' allow for escape from hell?  The fingers through the grate will tell you.
The Music:  How can one 'simple' piece on a zither carry ALL the moods of so emotionally complex a story?  It does.  It is so perfect that a visual of the instrument being played is even used to meaningfully introduce the film.  And, if that wouldn't be enough, the melody is so hypnotic that ""The Third Man Theme"" went on to be a top-ten radio hit.
Last, but certainly not least, The Acting:  Masterful beyond words.  Orson Wells' walk as he approaches the Ferris Wheel tells us more about the man then 20 minutes of typical expositional dialog.  Joseph Cotton is equally wonderful to watch.  Even a child and a parrot perform their parts perfectly!

Dark, bleak, slow, and nasty -- but never  gratuitous.  At least one reviewer distinguishes between ""film""  and ""movie,"" and this has to be considered a film.  But, oddly  enough, while some ""great films"" also seem inaccessible, this one  is not.  It's only days (or maybe weeks, or maybe years) later that you  recognize, ""this was a great film, one of the few to call great.""  While watching it, it's just entertainment.
The Criterion Edition, so  near as I could tell, was flawless. No ""improving"" to make it  ""better than the original"" -- just good crisp black and white  with details in the shadows and no distractions from streaks or scratches.  Audio of its time, but clear, crisp, not muddled.  The bonus of a radio  broadcast or two of the Welles ""Third Man"" series (with a nowhere  near so cynical hero) showing an old Zenith radio as the image on the  screen, didn't hurt the nostalgia quotient.
This was a movie that could  only have been made when it was made.  It uses post WW-II Vienna as a  backdrop, a Vienna of extravagant architectural excess crushed into ruin by  bombings of the war.  The rubble is as much the story as the cynicism or  the innocence.  A child whose father (or grandfather) was murdered points  an accusing finger at Cotton (the nominal 'hero' if the movie could have  such a thing) in accusation of murder.

To think that Selznick didn't want  Welles in the role. Had anyone else played Lime, ""The Third Man""  would not be the classic movie that it is.
The greatest scene is between  Welles and Joseph Cotten (miscast, should have been played by Jimmy  Stewart) on the Prater ferris wheel. Welles improvised his dialogue here  and you can see it from Cotten's disjointed replied and surprised  countenance. But it works... and it's a brilliantly-acted scene by Welles.

679076,5,630347327X,"Two things transform ""The Third Man"" from just a great movie to the greatest. The first is the zither music, which would seem (to most) to be completely wrong for a nihilistic story based in post-WW2, occupied  Vienna. The incongruity is perfect counter-point to the moody, skewed  cinematography and complex set of characters that occupy this movie.
The  second is a scene in a Ferris Wheel, full of under-stated menance and  unspoken betrayals. To my taste, Harry Lime is the definitive Orson Welles  character--much more than Charles Kane-- and he imbues the movie with such  charismatic danger, despite being in only a few scenes. Which brings us  back to the Ferris Wheel: his speech connecting the Borgias and cuckoo  clocks is itself worth the time invested in this film.

My  expectations were pretty high since it has been named one of the greatest  films of all time. And they were surpassed. What a great film! The story,  the acting, the cinematography were flawless.

I've watched the film in my head many times, read dozens of reviews and had as high expectations as you can have for a movie. So understandably, when  they showed the film last night on cable, I locked everybody out, switched  the light out and got ready. The film starts with narration by Joseph  Cotton, with Vienna laying stark in black and white in the background and  sets the tones for dark and brooding thriller. A few minutes in my HEART  STARTED TO SINK, the dialouge seemed dated, the way one scence fizzled into  the next was old fashioned, the zither music was wierd and jarring for a  thriller, and I found Trevor Howard to be too animated. Was this going to  be case like Casablance where a simple and silly film is blown completely  out of propotion by critics who fell it is sacreligious to pan old films  that have dated. I felt like switching it off, just to keep the legend  going, but then the film picked up in an amzing U-turn. Carol Reed has  accomplished one of the best and most twisted directorial jobs ever, no  shot is simple, the camera is always slightly tilted, giving a disorienting  feeling throughout. The stark black and white is beautiful to behold making  Vienna seem all the mork like a beautiful and aristocratic vision of a cold  hell, where creatures like Harry Lime lurk at night always proceeded by a  feline rubbing against their legs. Which of course brings me to Orson  Welles, the man has incredible presence, its not really a performance he  gives as much as providing an enigma. You understand why Anna might worship  him right away, and she is as wounded in this film as the children  recieving Harry's diluted Penicilin. But my simpathy was with Holly, who in  a great backstage scene declares his love, but we know he can never compete  with Lime, even when he's dead. There is too much to say about this film,  but after the relatively static first 20 minutes have gone, you won't be  thinking about the films place in history becuase you will be too wraped up  in it. Two magnificent scenes to watch out for, one is the entrance of  Harry Lime, and the other is the incredible, sad and beautiful final scene  which I will not spoil except to say that it is the single best closing  scene to a movie I've ever seen.

679174,5,630347327X,"This is the first DVD I purchased and it will always be among my favorites.  The setting is one which has always fascinated me: post-war Vienna with its multinational police force, shady characters, architecture  and statues from the days of the Strauss family, strange-looking people  (including the oddest little boy I've ever seen) and an ambience of aged  gilded charm with an undercurrent of intrigue and black-marketeering.  Irresistable. And that's just for openers!  This excellent edition has  numerous extra features which anyone who loves movies will appreciate.  The  black and white cinematography is superb. The masterly use of the medium  provides a rich texture which would be completely lost if it were done in  color. I wonder if anyone nowadays could do an original black and white  film which could be so very memorable and to create so many strong images  without simply copying from the work of filmakers in the 30s and 40s?  Joseph Cotton's performance deserves mention. This film,as is,  ""Citizen Kane"" so associated with Orson Welles, and correctly so,  that Joseph Cotton is frequently taken for granted. He played his roles in  both films with naturalness and believability. I cannot think of ""The  Third Man"" without remembering the sound of his opening narrative (a  technique used to great advantage in the film dramas of movies and radio  programs of the period). Happily, Criterion has also given us the abridged  recording of author Graham Greene's treatment, read by actor Richard Clarke  as well, so that we may be allowed to discover the differences between  them.  I strongly recommend this movie and this Criterion DVD in  particular. Enjoy the visit into the Old World, enhanced by the uniqueness  of the zither music. It reminds us of just how exotic and different is the  world of Harry Lime from our own.",950659200,11,1846,5.046511627906977
679175,5,630347327X,"It was with great anticipation that I viewed The Third Manrecently.  I had last seen it nearly 25 years earlier.  At the earlierviewing I was impressed with the atmospheric treatment of Vienna and the mystery surrounding Joseph Cotton's search for the truth about his friend Harry (Orson Wells).  However, though I then thought of it as a very fine movie, I did not think it would rank in my top 20.  Now I see what I missed as a younger person.  I can also see why this film would rank as number one on a British list of greatest films of the 20th century.
The film is a surreal examination of the tension between loyalty, love, and friendship on the one hand, and truth and justice on the other.  The Viennese are suffused with the cynicism of a destroyed continent and damaged culture.  The British know only about the truth and justice side of the equation.  The American writer of simple westerns still is nave enough to care about friendship and truth, and follows both wherever they lead.  At the same time, Carol Reed scarcely shoots a scene in which there are right angles.  Nearly everything is tilted.  Close-ups of faces exaggerate their features. The black and white of the film emphasizes the shadowy nature of the story and its moral underpinnings.
This magnificently filmed and wonderfully acted masterpiece has remained in my mind for days after seeing it.  If you are a lover of cinema and not merely of movies, please get this classic.  It richly deserves its reputation.  Highly recommended.  END",950400000,8,1516,4.7110266159695815

It's probably very interesting for film school students. But why is the fact  that Orson Welles appears late in the movie a stroke of genius?
While  this is a good movie, I don't think it ranks anywhere near some other Orson  works like ""A Touch of Evil.""  The plot is rather dull, moves  slowly and the ""surprise"" was easily predictable even though this  was the first time I had seen the movie.
The zither music was nice at the  beginning, but the same old tune got tiresome by the end.  In a lot of  scenes, the rather lively music was completely inappropriate for the action  on the screen.  It's very hard to keep the mystery and suspense going with  this monotonously happy tune blaring from the speakers.",945993600,9,850,4.477124183006536
679282,5,630347327X,"I must have seen this film before, but it felt like the first time watching it on DVD. Certainly, the haunting theme played on a zither is never to be forgotten (played and composed by an unknown musician at the  time, Anton Karos). Criterion has done a fantastic job in refurbishing the  old print and making it like new. The quality of the picture is remarkable,  and the sound track is crisp and clean - bravo! This is a black and white  film, Orson Welles is said to have remarked that b/w is the actors best  medium, and when you watch this movie you'll understand why? The stars are  uniformly excellent (with minor reservations noted below) - Orson Welles,  Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli. But, I doubt this film would  be half of what it is without the extraordinary location of post war  Vienna, 1947. As well, the contribution of the Austrian cast is crucial to  the authentic feel of the narrative. This was the inspired idea of Sir  Alexander Korda (Producer), who wanted a movie shot in Vienna and written  by Graham Greene the master mystery writer.
Director Carol Reed had asked  for Jimmy Stewart and was given Joseph Cotton instead (by co-producer  Selznick) for the role of Holly Martins. Martins is a character who writes  paperback westerns for a living, although in his case it hasn't been paying  too well, so he's in Vienna to meet his old pal Harry Lime who has offered  him some work. He arrives in time to watch Lime get buried. Carol  introduces the narrative at the beginning (UK version), but if you want to  hear a better introduction listen to Cotton's version (for US audiences)  found in the additional material included on the DVD . In hindsight Carol's  instinct for Jimmy Stewart is uncanny. The Third Man is more than a mystery  story, it's an epiphany. For it may seem the black-market is a legitimate  way of life in a bombed out, occupied and divided city, but there are  limits, even between friends. This is the experience the protagonist has  and is shared by the audience. It's an experience not capable of being  articulated only felt, and Jimmy Stewart would have manifested this feeling  better than Cotton's role. It's a trivial point, and certainly does not  alter my opinion that The Third Man is one of the best movies ever made. As  an end note however, had Selznick gotten his way and nixed Orson Welles as  Harry Lime, then this would have been an also ran movie!",945993600,15,2431,4.625292740046838

The extra features include lots of production stills, a nice introduction  by Peter Bogdanovich (sp?), and an alternative soundtrack with Graham  Greene's story layered over the movie.  There are, in addition, a couple of  ""Third Man"" radio broadcasts to listen to, along with a very nice  newsreel clip of Anton Karas on the zither.

7849508,5,630347327X,"Highlighted by extraordinary cinematography and music, this b & w film is an intricate mystery in which Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) searches for his old friend, the enigmatic, cynical, and sinister Harry Lime (Orson Welles).  In the process, Holly falls in love with Anna, Harry's old flame.  There are many twists, turns, and surprises along the way.  The shot of Harry's fingers reaching up for freedom through a manhole cover is unforgettable, as is the closing shot of Anna walking wordlessly past Holly on a tree-lined road.",1520812800,,531,5.080459770114943

7849511,1,630347327X,Movie ? 5stars!!!  Blu ray? 1 star. And the one i picked up is the 4k transfer studio canal one. The transfer is somewhat crisp but grainy. Worst part is the audio.  I have a Samsung LED tv. With most blu rays i crank the audio anywhere from 8-13. With this disc i had to turn it up to 25-28 just to hear the thing.  Im really kicking myself for not grabbing that Criterion blu ray that was sadly discontinued,1519516800,,409,4.0875
