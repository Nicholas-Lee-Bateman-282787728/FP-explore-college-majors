1990276,1,B0001DCYKA,"I was shocked. This was a low end movie. Low end acting. Low end plot. Shoot, even the stealing of the idea was low end. Yes, this was hailed a ""Gayer Death Trap"" but I hardly saw anything that was as thrilling or suspenseful as that movie was. Maybe it was so ""hailed"" because of all the implied sex with hints of nudity, but I'm not hailing any part of it. The actors were good looking but their acting was devoid of any real emotion or charisma.

What a waste of time. I rented it... thank goodness...",1104624000,10,504,4.195876288659794
1990277,1,B0001DCYKA,"This film is basically not worth watching - its derivative plot is silly in the extreme, its characters nonintentionally comical and its dialogue so ludicrous as to be pathetic.  How on earth did this pap ever get made?  Don't waste your money on this garbage, and don't be fooled by the glowing reviews on this site.  I suspect, as one reviewer pointed out, all the great reviews were likely submitted by friends of the filmmaker, or perhaps even the fimmaker himself (under a series of pseudonyms).",1103500800,10,500,4.790697674418604
1990278,1,B0001DCYKA,"Based on the many popular review of this movie on here, I rented this DVD. Yet having seen the film, I am suspicious of the over the top reviews on here and I'm left to wonder at their comments. Is there a married Hollywood producer somewhere being blackmailed into this film by his secret gay lover?

This film was awful. It is nothing more than a sketched out premise, much like a porno aspiring to more than it is by adding a plot. Only there isn't even the sex to keep you interested.

The characters are flat and one-dimensional, reacting to situations in incomprehensibly melodramatic ways. I don't mean that it's a matter of suspended belief for the point of the story. I mean that the logical gaps in the dialogue and character development are so big you can parallel-park a Hum-V between them.  There is terrible character development, a weak plot, and in the end, one could care less about the people portrayed.",1102291200,6,921,4.603658536585366
1990279,5,B0001DCYKA,"... I invite you to watch Ben & Arthur."" A true low budget, badly acted, badly directed, badly edited tragic effort. The leading actor, who starred in, directed and produced this movie has some serious issues with both the the church and being gay and truly needs therapy.  I find it hard to call it a ""movie."" Compare the two : ""The M.O. of  M.I."" to the ""B&A."" I am sure you will be reassessing your opinion of this great film in a heartbeat.",1084579200,,444,4.273809523809524
1990280,1,B0001DCYKA,"I saw this film a few months ago at the Melbourne (Australia) Queer Film Fest.  Other films on the program ran the gamut, but were largely high quality, and I knew they couldn't all be good, but this one took the prize as the ultimate stinker.  I am open minded and like a lot of low budget gay films where I feel those involved have provided something different and show talent, however buried in budget constraints. ""The MO of MI"" was just plain bad.  How bad was it? Well, about two thirds through it the film had gotten so jaw droppingly absurd (in terms of story, writing and acting) that I burst out laughing in the theater, and that launched everyone else there - the hooting didn't stop until the film ended.
There is certainly room in gay films for stories that are off center, that have a mystery element, that bring characters to fore who are not exemplary or part of the usual gay stable.  ""The Mo of MI"", though, telegraphs its plot with writing that is totally unnatural and acting that is, well, laughable (really).  The one redeeming thing about the film is the fact the leads are all quite attractive.  If only they didn't have to say anything.",1083110400,9,1161,4.478672985781991
1990281,1,B0001DCYKA,"Just when I thought that gay films couldn't get any worse than ""Sordid Lives"" or ""The Journey of Jared Price,"" along comes this stinker.
This is a truly horrible film.  It bears comparison with ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and other classics of bad film.  The plot line is stupid and completely obvious.  Anybody who doesn't see the ""plot twist"" coming (guess what?  A main character isn't who you think he is...if you're an idiot, that is) has never seen a single suspense movie in their life.  The acting is painful.  I have no tolerance for bad acting, and this movie gave me hives.  The three main characters are all acted horribly.  The most awful aspect of this movie, however, is the writing.  I have never seen a movie with such bad dialogue (including the shamefully bad ""Journey of Jared Price"").  The performance art scenes deserve particular mention here.  Whoever wrote that dialogue must have been joking.
Gay people deserve better movies than this.  Remember ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Get Real""?  Where did movies like that go?",1081900800,16,1039,4.8352272727272725
1990282,5,B0001DCYKA,"Bravo to Aaron Brown for constructing a superior screenplay not seen in most predictable, ""been there, done that"" plots we see in so many movies today. As a viewer, you will be played with constantly througout the film up to the very end. Just when you think you have settled on a spectrum of feelings and opinions about the characterrs and the storyline, the next scene will vanquish your new pre-conceived, constantly changing notions.
It was a shame that the film did not get bigger distribution, especially on the festival circut. The unfounded and short-sighted criticsm was that a movie should not be seen or made that puts ""gays in a bad light."" Rubbish! Gay people aren't a large group of apostles. This decision kept this movie from gaining the larger viewing audience and exposure it deserves for both the quality film it is and the talented actors who brought it to life.
If you buy one DVD this year, I highly recommend ""The M.O. of M.I."" This is a film you will want to tell your friends about. The movie and everyone involved in its construction deserves the word of mouth to gain the recognition it merits! I eagarly look forward to Mr. Brown's next cinema effort.",1080432000,14,1179,4.673076923076923

8010472,5,B0001DCYKA,"It's rare to find a gay suspense movie.  This was low budget, but it certainly was a find.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1365811200,,138,4.269230769230769
8010473,1,B0001DCYKA,"Ludicrous thriller with an incomprehensible plot.  (Something to do with drugs and stealing some guy's money, I think.)  This one has everything:  bad acting, bad dialogue, bad songs.  At least David Christopher gets to play a performance artist who spouts bad poetry.  So in those scenes he does a good job.  He gets to play a man who is a bad actor.  Talk about typecasting!",1314835200,,376,4.6923076923076925

8010476,1,B0001DCYKA,"I'm sorry I can't give this one a rating lower than 1 star, because I think it really doesn't deserve any at all.

Other reviewers have hinted at the sound quality, but the mix on this movie was so bad I don't think I heard more than 1/3 of the dialogue.  Did anyone involved in making the movie listen to it before it was released?  Or maybe the sound mixer found out there wasn't any money to pay him, and this was his joke on the director and producer?  Between dialogue recorded at a level inaudible to anyone except Superman to dialogue at a normal level, but with the rock soundtrack blasting over it, I shouldn't comment on the script, but what I did hear was derivative and hackneyed.

The acting?  Bad for the most part.  I would particularly single out Cory Schneider in this regard.

Plotline?  Again, hackneyed and stale.

Unlike another reviewer, I didn't start laughing until it was over, but then I couldn't stop laughing at the idea that this movie takes itself seriously.  It may at some point reach the status of camp classic, but that's all it will ever be.

Please, I beg you, save your 13 bucks!  Rent it if you feel you have to, but don't waste good money buying this piece of tripe.",1136073600,5,1205,4.398190045248869
8010477,1,B0001DCYKA,"I was dismayed by the way this movie lurched on to an unpredictable, but incredibly unsatisfying ending!  I thought the premise sounded intruiging so I rented it, and am thankful I had not bought it.

The movie started out with promise, but quickly I found myself thinking no couple would endure what is going on.  AND when the movie took a right turn (I am trying not to be a spoiler here), I found the actions being taken completely unbelievable and the ending was a total shocker (and not in a good way).

Sadly, I wanted to like this film.  It does have some good things going for it, but in the end, I cannot recommend this movie.",1133913600,5,635,4.3474576271186445
8010478,1,B0001DCYKA,"I bought this movie based on glowing reviews on another web-site and I was terribly disappointed. While the basic story was a good concept, it was executed horribly. There was literally nothing good about this movie. I wanted to turn it off but I kept watching, hoping it would get better. It didn't! Bad acting, bad writing, bad movie. Don't waste your money.",1114041600,14,360,4.73015873015873
8010479,5,B0001DCYKA,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was.  I think Ardustry hit a homerun with this one. This is movie is compelling and kept my attention the whole time.  Great plot, quality, actors.  What more could you want!!!",1105401600,6,226,4.333333333333333
