2078218,4,B0002D1252,Fun to look at and good menu options.  Informative for each artist featured.,1177459200,2,76,4.846153846153846
2078219,5,B0002D1252,"This product worked exactly as advertised. Beautiful images and a sensible set of options, including very nice musical choices.",1167696000,5,127,5.7368421052631575
2078220,5,B0002D1252,"I enjoy images...and viewing them in different ways...and this DVD, Ambient Art really provides that experience.  350 paintings that can be viewed as a slide show or as a movie (image is scanned) and with either classical music or a more contemporary music.  It is so good for me...I wish Ambient art would do a disc on Grandma Moses, one on Maxfield Parrish and one on Thomas Hart Benton...so we would also have some American images available.

The Impressionist disc has 11 artists and you can select the artists you want to see, the length of time you view each, etc. It is very pleasant to have on at a party...no sound.  Well, I just like it a lot, and if you enjoy art here is an art experience different from a museum or a book. For me, it fills a need...I hope it will for you.",1151884800,43,785,4.319727891156463
2078221,5,B0002D1252,This was a housewarming gift and it was very well received.  The choice of a narrator or classical music to go along with the paintings is an added bonus.  I would defintatly recommed this to anyone who has a large screen TV or who needs a really unique gift.,1142467200,15,259,4.26530612244898
2078261,4,B0002D1252,"its like having a art studio! waching all the different picture, on the tv set even music sounds so soothing!",1373068800,,109,4.5
2078262,5,B0002D1252,"this is just what I hoped for, very flexible as far as setting picture or pictures and if you let it slide show some nice music.",1340841600,,128,3.9615384615384617
2078263,5,B0002D1252,This DVD is wondeful.  The paintings are beautiful.  They look oh so brilliant on my flat screen tv.  The DVD and its contents are even more than I imagined they would be.  Anyone interested in the Impressionists would be so happy to own this DVD.,1309996800,,247,4.4222222222222225
2078264,4,B0002D1252,"I bought this to include in a French art unit for my middle school French students.  It gives you two choices when viewing:  music or biographical information as art images are panned across.  I use the biographical information at first (it's perhaps a little dry for middle schoolers, but on the other hand, each biography is only about 5 minutes long), and then when the narrator has finished, there are a few more minutes of paintings shown with just music in the background.  My students answer questions based on the biography for the first part, then during the second part they note colors in French that they see in each of the paintings.

From a teacher's viewpoint, some of the artwork includes nudity, so you have to decide if that will be an issue for your students/parents/administration before showing.",1308614400,,816,4.841726618705036
2078265,4,B0002D1252,"I do like this DVD and another DVD from the same series (fire) that I own. On big screen it looks nice but I mute it because the music isn't good to my ear. I give it four star, because my other dvd of impressionism art, offers twice as many artworks and I like the music selection better.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Impressionists-Art-Gallery-and-Music-of-the-Time-2DVDs-3CDs-set-Art-by-Van-Gogh-Cezanne-Renoir-Gauguin-Seurat-Degas-and-Music-by-Respighi-Offenbach-Ponchielli-Saint-Sans-Strauss/dp/B001EUFYBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Impressionists Art Gallery and Music of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs set, Art by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Renoir, Gauguin, Seurat, Degas and Music by Respighi, Offenbach, Ponchielli, Saint-Sans, Strauss</a>",1277510400,2,776,7.931034482758621
2078266,2,B0002D1252,"I give them credit for the compilation of the art and the variety of presentations, but I expected better quality images. The ""high resolution"" wallpaper versions are 1024 x 768, which include a large border with the ""Ambient Art"" title overlapping the many of the images. The actual image is roughly 800 x 500 depending on the painting.",1268092800,17,337,4.827586206896552
2078267,5,B0002D1252,"I bought one for myself and two as gifts.  I enjoy having this on the TV while entertaining guests.  Always generates comments.  The visuals are great, especially on a large HDTV, and the music is lovely.",1264809600,2,204,4.611111111111111
2078268,5,B0002D1252,"We were delighted to discover that this DVD can be played in a variety of modes: movie mode with educational narration, movie mode with just music, slide shows of various lengths, a created playlist. The resolution of the art on our TV screen is excellent. I would recommend this product to any lover of impressionistic art.",1264550400,,324,4.803571428571429
2078269,5,B0002D1252,My friends are captivated by this DVD.  It gives me constant pleasure because I leave it ON all day long and can easily switch over to catch news alerts with one click of a button. Really a classy addition to my living room.,1253577600,,224,4.209302325581396
2078270,1,B0002D1252,I don't know if it is a problem with the DVD or the Samsung BluRay player but this is the only disc of the four I ordered that would not work in the machine.  I just saw a previous reviewer stated having the same problem and wished I had read it prior to ordering this DVD.  I'm really bummed because this was the DVD I was most looking forward to watching.,1252886400,4,357,4.014084507042254
2078305,1,B0002D1252,"It seems that technology has left this DVD by the wayside, since it fails to play on my Samsung BluRay or on either of my computer's DVD players.  Prior to this DVD I have had no problems with viewing new or old DVDs or BluRay discs.  The problem may be in format used on the DVD.  Beware.",1251158400,8,289,4.035087719298246

2078307,5,B0002D1252,"I bought 2 of these  DVD one for a birthday gift for a friend who has everything..  And she loved it!

I am just getting into the art world and I find it informative and very calming.  I play it when I want to relax.

Great item! 5 stars!",1245888000,,238,3.7755102040816326
2078308,5,B0002D1252,"I was expecting a lot and this DVD is it!  Exceptionally well done with great interactive options.  I believe it is soon to be in HD format and I will get that too.  Also gave a second one as a gift to my 86 year old father who loved it as well. As always, Amazon had the best price.  Enjoy!",1239062400,,291,3.8
2078309,5,B0002D1252,This DVD was exactly what I was looking to play in my cafe'. Hope there are more out there!,1231632000,2,91,3.8421052631578947
2078310,5,B0002D1252,I am quite pleased with this DVD! The marketing and description of the DVD are very accurate. You will not be misled. The picture quality is good and it fits my widescreen television very well. I love having the ability to customize what will play. I really appreciated having the option for both music and/or commentary. The music was very nice and relaxing. It accompanied the art work quite well. I am really looking forward to playing this DVD for friends. It will make a nice backdrop to any party. I am quite pleased with my purchase!,1230336000,,540,4.577319587628866
2078311,5,B0002D1252,"This DVD can be run in either 'movie' or 'slideshow' mode. In slideshow mode, you can set both the artist and the time for each piece of art to be displayed. More than 300 masterpieces are included. On my 1080p plasma in my study, using slideshow mode with sound muted, I feel like I'm transported to a museum, able to enjoy the beauty of this art in my own home! It is breath-taking.

In contrast, other DVDs like ""Masterpieces of Western Art: A Virtual Art Gallery"" only give you movie mode without the high-quality slide show presented by ""Ambient Art: Impressionist Art Gallery"". The latter has been an extraordinary investment for me. I hope that you enjoy it too!",1229212800,4,669,4.621848739495798
2078312,4,B0002D1252,"Great idea, implementation is ok.
I had the vision in my head of my TV as a big scrolling painting... it doesn't quite work out that way as most all of the art is not 16:9 format.
Pictures are still nice and for dinner parties it's nicer than a big 'black hole' in my wall, but the effect isn't nearly as good as what I imagined it would be.",1221523200,,341,3.9565217391304346
2078313,5,B0002D1252,"We use this DVD in our nursing home in the recreation department
The residents love to discuss and critique each painting! We highly recommend this andwish there was more of them!!!",1199232000,,181,4.870967741935484
2078314,4,B0002D1252,"This made for a very nice and classy background while I had a dinner party. Many people gravitated towards it, and I overheard some nice comments. Only use this for your more sophisticated friends though, the hillbilly side of my family showed up and tried to change the channel...",1184976000,13,281,4.755102040816326

8026523,3,B0002D1252,The art looks good in HD. The problem is that I was looking for a DVD that more or less turns your TV into a picture of art hanging on the wall. Well this is not it as most of the pictures do not fill up the screen. I guess this makes sense as the art is different sizes in different configurations but I really want a DVD that only has art that fills the entire screen up.,1394496000,3,373,3.7948717948717947
8026524,1,B0002D1252,"I had high expectations - maybe too high.  Clumsy 'programming' for the display features - rather limited.  I wish some of the more remarkable museums would produce something similar - and raise money for art education for our schools or some other charitable purpose.  In my opinion, don't waste your money.",1389139200,,308,5.0
8026525,2,B0002D1252,I wish the disc allow you to pick and choose a collection of paintings from different artists to create your own playlist. Right now it is configured to allow you to pick a list of artists and watch ALL the paintings from those artists. It's hard to explain art to an eight years old when your kid watching you looking at a naked painting on TV.,1388448000,,345,4.242424242424242
