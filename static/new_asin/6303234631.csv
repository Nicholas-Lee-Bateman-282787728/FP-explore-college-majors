7842672,2,6303234631,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magic-Kid/dp/B0002S64WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magic Kid</a>&nbsp;was a flawed but decent freshman vehicle for karate kid Ted Jan Roberts, but its sequel here is merely flawed. Losing the original film's strengths in the process of multiplying its weaknesses, ""Magic Kid 2"" sees its lone bright star - Roberts - slowly eclipsed by more buffoonery than even a PG-rated picture should have to put up with. The martial arts are still better than typical kiddie fare, but not enough to put up with the rest of the feature.

The story: having become a movie star, young Kevin (Roberts) is unhappily stuck in a job that stifles his integrity leaves him little time to be a regular kid. When his pleas for a more relaxed schedule fail to sway his domineering agent (Hugo Napier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tomorrow-Never-Dies/dp/B000RPCK1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tomorrow Never Dies</a>) and his intimidated uncle (Stephan Furst), he will need to take matters into his own hands.

What hurts the movie more than anything for a viewer older than seven is that with very few exceptions, the story is populated by ridiculously goofy characters. The obsessive agent who thinks the best way to deal with a runaway star is to have his henchman (Donald Gibb,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>) beat up the uncle is one matter, but it's the same uncle who takes the level of buffoonery into orbit. Stephan Furst's role is even more overblown than in the first picture, and his performance is one of painful abandon as he engages in arguments with his pet bulldog and completely overexerts himself while pantomiming martial arts moves. Occasionally, there's a genuinely funny gag, but this coincides with some sexual humor that parents probably won't appreciate in a PG flick.

Ted does his best in being the only sensible individual amidst all the adult goofballs, but even his acting suffers a bit of a low when he has to play a teen romance scene with a young Dana Barron (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happythankyoumoreplease/dp/B004UVYQVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happythankyoumoreplease</a>). His impressive karate moves make a statement of their own and peak early in a stick fight with Richard Rabago (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VR-Troopers/dp/B008HUSFG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VR Troopers</a>), but the majority of the brawls are intentionally hokey setups being shot for a fictional movie. A funny but unexciting chase scene yields an impressive chicken truck crash, and later three sports cars explode for the sake of quota, but that's about it as far as the action goes.

Oddly absent from the sequel are both Shonda Whipple as Kevin's sister and Don Wilson as Kevin's idol. While I don't miss Kevin's incessant hero worship, the movie would have benefited from Wilson's presence, and Shonda's absence may make this one less appealing to young girls. Then again, the film's audience probably isn't going to compose of much these days other than nostalgic fans. Know yourself before purchasing.",1393286400,,3312,6.085653104925053
7842673,3,6303234631,"If you like the genre of 80's martial arts films like I do, this one isn't too bad.",1167782400,,83,3.6666666666666665
7842674,3,6303234631,"This one has the same normal kid as in the first one but now with a supernatural twist about two magic rings that each give the wearer special fighting powers. When our hero gets the first ring baddies came after him  from everywhere. There are some corny lines like when at the end he is  fighting the god like man with both rings and show how he can shoot bolts  of lightning that make cars explode and his freinds tell everyone around  them not to use their guns because the powerless little boy needs the pride  of killing a deity all by himself, there by putting hostages at risk. Leave  it to the power ranger fans unless you're desperate for fight scenes",960681600,3,661,4.377049180327869
