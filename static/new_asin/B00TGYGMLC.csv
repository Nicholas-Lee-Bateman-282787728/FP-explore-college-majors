7009458,5,B00TGYGMLC,"Ethan Hawkes character in Good Kill has a robotic sensibility, only running on energy drinks and bottomless coffee. His job isn't an easy one. He sits in an air-conditioned trailer for the good majority of his days and nights manning drones that hover over the homes and meeting places of terrorists. His job is to make sure that these targets are terminated, even when the kills aren't always clean of civilian casualties. And this character - Major Thomas Egan - doesnt cope with this well. Hes a quiet man who keeps his rage and discomfort inside, often draining his leftover emotions with a bottle of alcohol and a long drive.

Hawke, who is undoubtedly one of the most reliable actors alive and working today, handles the many dimensions of this man with his usual excellence. We feel for this guy, even as he remains speechless throughout most of the drama. Few actors can emote as well as Hawke does here, and he uses his expressions to reach a certain authenticity. I also found it remarkable that the film is able to succeed and progress constantly while being stuck in the same setting for the bulk of the screen-time. But, without fail, theres something new for this group to deal with each day, and the ethics of the situation are what make it all so compelling. The timeliness is startling, especially knowing that theres someone out there doing this difficult job even as you read this.

Andrew Niccol, who you may know from his work on Gattaca and Lord of War, writes and directs beautifully. Hes got a real talent for choosing the right actors to carry his material, with the great supporting performances from Zo Kravitz and Bruce Greenwood proving that point. Its one of the most well-acted films Ive seen so far this summer, with Ethan Hawkes powerful role making this one a must-see for any avid movie fan.",1435190400,10,1826,4.703125

7009461,5,B00TGYGMLC,"Wowie Zowie.

If that wasn't bad enough, when I started to write this review I decided to read through a few of the ones already written.  Silly me, once again I gave humanity way too much credit.  I thought that anyone, no matter whether they think the war is right or wrong, good or bad etc., would agree that wantonly blowing bona fide innocent civilians away is bad, wrong etc.  But no.  In fact I took a look at the numbers of positive vs. negative reviews of the movie and there are almost as many negative as positive, 25 to 32 counting me.  Bah, humanity!

What I think is that this kind of war, this drone war, is not like any other war and it can't be compared to any other war.",1478390400,,688,4.166666666666667

7009480,4,B00TGYGMLC,"I freaking loved this movie.  I am so tempted to give it 5 stars, but there are some elements that are missing.  The overwhelming premise of the movie is the war on terror and what is acceptable collateral damage.  MOST humans aren't wired to kill other humans and this takes it's toll on the human psyche.  Especially when some Taliban leader is taken out along with a woman and child; is this justifiable?  American lives are saved, in theory.

Ethan Hawke was perfect for this roll.  He nailed it.  There was another (I'm not sure she was an officer) Suarez who worked in ""the sweatbox with Tommy Egan ""Hawke.""  The chemistry between these two was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I did not realize that she was Zoe Kravitz.  Egan's wife, Molly, from ""Mad Men,"" I can't say that they had great chemistry.  She is a wonderful actor, but the role could have been better picked.  Maybe this was intentional.  Every Air Force crewman was trying to do the right thing and had to deal with taking orders and pushing a button to kill people that were a possible threat.  These are orders that may have gone against their better judgement.  However, in the military you do not question your superiors.

The ending felt rushed and although I was able to discern what was happening, I don't think it was done properly.  I don't want to say anymore.  This may not be best, but it's one of my favorite movies I watched this year.  I think the 6.4 IMDB rating was a little low.",1468454400,,1474,4.432835820895522
7009481,3,B00TGYGMLC,"... the Colonel's duty was to report him to a mandatory psych evaluation.  But on the other hand, there wouldn't be a movie?  A good flick, though...",1467936000,,149,4.481481481481482
7009482,4,B00TGYGMLC,"The future of warfare? Of course it's already here, but we can guess that later in the 21st century these point & click offensives will be preferred by nations inclined to use and able to afford the technology. Why? In protracted or never-ending conflicts, the American public tires of hearing about American deaths... but with drones, you are presented with an equation of more drones = fewer Americans doing the dying (and for less dollars).

The cast is brilliant. Ethan Hawke is convincing as the protagonist, Tom, a man put into an untenable position (unsustainable even for someone who is trained to kill). January Jones (aka Don Draper's ex-wife) seems right at home playing (what else?) the housewife. Zo Kravitz enters into the film as a vigorous young airman, Vera Suarez, who is mentally spent by the time the movie is done with her. Peter Coyote is perfectly cast as the voice on the other end of the line, ""Langley"" (referring to the CIA)... you will likely recognize his voice from other productions, as he has been in many.

Where does the Milgram experiment come in? Things become hairy when Langley starts to [literally] call the shots. Tom and Vera start to question what they are doing (Vera verbally, and Tom silently but destructively), yet as in the Milgram experiment, do it anyway. This becomes the plot. The story is well-written. The trailer almost makes it look like an action movie, which it is not. Much of Good Kill occurs in one room, although this includes sequences showing the airstrikes via convincing CGI.

 Final note after reading another review: To believe that the CIA would not do what is portrayed in Good Kill is to willingly live in a fantasy world. One need only stop pretending there aren't dozens of books about CIA operations in the 20th century. CIA may not pull the trigger, but they are dang good at getting others to do it for them.",1467590400,,1884,4.752293577981652

7009499,1,B00TGYGMLC,"Do your job. Quit your whining. This is a liberal-Hollywood movie designed to make America look like the aggressor, the bad guy. I could not make it more than 30-minutes before having to turn it off. I wish the liberals would replace every soldier serving in the war on terror, so they could get a feel for the enemy. I wish they would read their holy books, so they could understand their mindset.

7009500,1,B00TGYGMLC,"The first few minutes of this movie were promising; after that, it all went downhill.  First, did the movie producers even consult anyone with inside knowledge to how Air Force Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operations work?  A little consulting would've fixed this issue easily, but it seems the movie producers just wanted to tell a different story from the actual truth of what goes on; it seems the more they didn't know about something, the bigger the hole they dug trying to fill in what they didn't know.  Second, it paints RPA operations in such a negative light when these platforms have enabled so much in today's operations.  There was 1 glimmer of hope midway through when he provides some basic over-watch, but that's about as good as it ever gets. Sensor operators cannot just turn in their wings; pilots don't drink and drive or are driven to drink and drive because of the ops, nor do they drive through the 'strip' on the way to work.  Commanders don't drop the 'f-bomb' in every sentence they do, and overall, it paints a very bad picture that the US doesn't care about collateral damage, which is far from the truth.

If you are a pilot or sensor thinking about giving this movie a shot, don't.  At best, you can view it as a 'comedy' but even then, it still is horrible.  Don't waste your time.  Others who are considering a career in either of those, don't watch as well as it will taint your view of the career field as well as the AF.  This is a work of fiction and should be treated as such.",1464652800,2,1516,4.48

7009504,5,B00TGYGMLC,"Awesome movie showing the reality of our ""bloodless war"". It was very well acted and seems to be based on reality. As a pilot I usually can't stand watching action films like Die Hard II or anything with an aircraft because of the ridiculousness. I felt that this film is probably very close to the reality of our service men and women ""flying"" these missions. Every American should watch this and ask ourselves if this technology should be used for war. War in general just fattens the wallets of those in power with little regards to the human carnage.",1459987200,,554,4.606060606060606

8701701,3,B00TGYGMLC,"Major Tom Egan (Ethan Hawke) is a decorated Air-force pilot, who after five deployments, has been assigned to a base in Las Vegas, where he conducts drones strikes over Afghanistan. He hates his job and feels like a coward, but things get a whole lot worse, when the CIA commissions his team to start doing questionable jobs. Egan starts to come apart and take it out on his co-workers and family, leading to an uncertain future. IFC films are right at the top of my list right now as the absolute best in independent film. Seldom have they disappointed me, and I wouldn't describe my feelings about Good Kill as disappointed, but rather indifferent. This film, based on a true story, was exceptionally written and features a fantastic director and an amazing cast, but it also moves at a snails pace and is extremely repetitive. It's just drone strike, reaction, intervention, repeat, over and over again, followed by an ending that wasn't all that surprising. Ethan Hawke gives a powerful performance, despite the fact that he lacks the kind of emotion this role sorely needed. I understand that having Egan be this stone cold guy on the outside is a major theme, but it also makes for a lot of seemingly endless conversations and interactions. Good Kill has a lot of elements I look for in a movie, it's well written, has a cast I really enjoy, a director I know very well, still, it's lacking in emotion and levity. The film is monotonous and much longer than it had to be, all in all, not bad, but not great.",1532822400,,1513,4.607407407407408
