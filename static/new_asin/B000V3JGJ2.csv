2928642,4,B000V3JGJ2,"I bought this DVD because I am A big Pink Panther fan. I have slowly made my kids to like him and other of the classic cartoons. This dvd is not as good as the collection of all the shorts but it is a great add on if you want the whole collection of cartoons since these cartoons are not included with the box set. It Is great that it includeds the Valentine special and the special Olym-Pinks I believe all of the classics are now avaliabe on DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther-A-Pink-Christmas/dp/B000V3JGJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther - A Pink Christmas</a>",1197590400,6,632,5.459183673469388

2928644,5,B000V3JGJ2,"It was surprisingly thoughtful of MGM to release the other two Pink Panther TV Specials here on this DVD along with ""A Pink Christmas""!  It's not obvious from the cover or the DVD info listed that all three Pink Panther TV Specials are on this disc, but they indeed are.  ""A Pink Christmas"" which aired on ABC Dec 7, 1978; ""Olym-Pinks"" which aired on ABC Feb 22, 1980; and ""Pink At First Sight"" which aired on ABC May 10, 1981 were all approximately 25 minutes in length.  ""A Pink Christmas"" was adapted from a 1906 O. Henry short story called 'The Cop and the Anthem' (credited in the cartoon) and is a wonderful 'haves and have-nots' type story that makes a perfect adaptation to the world of the Pink Panther - it's not an exact re-telling, the character in the short story is trying to get into jail so he can be warm and have food, while the Panther is on a quest for food, but he does try at one point to get into a jail.  ""Olym-Pinks"" capitalized on the 1980 Winter Olympics that were held in Lake Placid, New York that year, and is a series of very competitive olympic games played between Panther and the 'little man' (as the animators referred to him).  And ""Pink At First Sight"", although aired in May of '81, is essentially a Valentine's Day story.  The studio could easily have only released the Christmas special and charged the same amount, but they used some foresight and gave we 'completists' a bonus with the other two TV Specials.  While not having the 'classic-ness' (for lack of a better word) of the 1960s Panther cartoons, the specials are fun, and clearly the Christmas special is the highlight of the DVD and easily worth the price in and of itself.  I remember when it first aired (I was 9) and it didn't really repeat all that often over the years.  And as a fan of animation, it's cool to actually have it on DVD after nearly 30 years.",1196899200,42,1864,4.411078717201166

2928683,5,B000V3JGJ2,I used to watch The Pink Panther when I was little and recently ordered his complete collection which I now have. Those are better than I remember and I can watch them anytime now. I wasn't aware he had done anything involving Christmas until I came across this DVD which I finally broke down and ordered. Im  a Christmas freak so whatever it is is going to be good to me. Especially if you like Christmas as much as I do you should get this. Merry Christmas.,1387584000,,459,4.275862068965517

2928685,5,B000V3JGJ2,Pretty cool old school cartoon.  There are 5 different and unique shows on this CD so it was well worth the money and they are as entertaining now as in the 60's and 70's.,1385856000,,171,4.029411764705882
2928686,3,B000V3JGJ2,All I can say is you should own everything else and have to be desperate for my PP if you buy this.  I still rate it a 2 as it is the man in pink.  I might even advise owning all the Inspector and Ant and the Aardvark before buying this as well.  It really isn't that great.,1365811200,,274,3.689655172413793
2928687,5,B000V3JGJ2,Humor in life is a great thing to experience.  The Pink Panther has a good heart and his skits are so much fun to watch. Never get tired of them.,1365120000,,145,3.8333333333333335

2928689,5,B000V3JGJ2,"The answer is ""NO"" I am in my 50's and grew up with pink! My older children 25+ grew up with and loved pink. And now our little gift from heaven now 9 has also been smitten (or bitten) by the Pink Panther! And the rest of us are reliving our childhood! This is a must see if you like the panther! And if you haven't met him yet this is a good DVD to enjoy with the whole family, it is silly fun!!!",1360713600,,397,3.738095238095238

2928692,5,B000V3JGJ2,"If you like the original run of Pink Panther cartoons, then you should get this DVD. I own ""The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection,"" which contains the entire run of Pink Panther theatrical and television shorts from 1964 to 1980. That is a great place to start if you enjoy the Pink Panther, but if you want to complete your collection, you will need this. This is a great DVD because you get 3 specials on one disc.

""A Pink Christmas"" features a homeless Pink Panther as he makes his way haphazardly through his city in hopes of finding something to eat. Chaos follows him everywhere he goes, and it is very reminiscent of the craziness found in the theatrical shorts.

""Olym-Pinks"" squares the Pink Panther off against his long-time rival, the short white man with the big nose and mustache, as two contenders in the Olympics. Their conflict starts on the train ride, follows them to their hotel, and continues into the actual games.

""Pink at First Sight"" was probably my favorite of the bunch. The Pink Panther is feeling lonely, being the only pink panther there is around town. With the desire to find a soul mate being all the more consuming due to the fact that Valentine's Day is in the air, the Pink Panther gets a job in order to earn money, in hopes of spending it on a special female panther, should he find one. Once again, chaos ensues everywhere the Pink Panther goes, and it's quite fun watching things spiral out of control.

So again, if you like the Pink Panther, you can't go wrong here. The charm and humor found in the Pink Panther shorts are on display here in these specials, so you will not be disappointed.",1356739200,2,1640,4.549152542372881
2928693,5,B000V3JGJ2,"My grandson loves the Pink Panther cartoon and this one was hard to find, except for Amazon!  He was so happy to find this dvd in his Christmas presents.  It's a fun dvd with 3 stories.  Well worth the small cost.",1356652800,,213,4.146341463414634
2928694,5,B000V3JGJ2,This is one of the funniest cartoons ever made.  Three generations of my family enjoyed it together and laughed like crazy.,1356220800,,123,4.857142857142857

2928696,5,B000V3JGJ2,i loved this movie an came just as was supposed to an i was very satisfied with packaging an everything also a very good movie who don't like pink panther cartoon i love him hes funny as hell lol,1354752000,,195,4.0256410256410255

2928698,3,B000V3JGJ2,"I love the Pink Panther cartoons.  This is not up to par.  The DVD is really 3 half hour long TV specials.  1.  The Christmas special.  It has very little to do with Christmas and is just episodes of the Pink Panther trying to get something to eat.  All very episodic and looks like it could have been several shorts strung together, though it is not. 2.  Is  a TV special about the winter olympics.  Agian, looks like parts of shorts strung together, but are not.  The Pink Panther goes to compeat in the winter olympics and drives another skier crazy.  3.  Is a Valentines Day special.  The Pink Panther looking for love.  This has random scenes of him looking for a mate in all the wrong places.  This DVD only cost me about $6 so I am fine with it.  I want all of the the Pink Panther cartoons and for this price it is worth it.  But it is not up  quality of the classic cartoons.",1352505600,,884,4.160714285714286
2928699,4,B000V3JGJ2,"Three specials on one DVD! Not quite as inventive as the original shorts, this program drags just a little bit--20+ minutes per show rather than the original 6 or 7 means spending a lot longer on one subject. The Christmas story is entertaining, it's nice to see the competition with the little guy, and especially interesting to see Pink in a love story! Anyone who likes Pink Panther will enjoy the program. Just don't expect it to be quite the same as the shorts from the '60s and '70s. Oh, and the theme song--the same song, but with a few musical variations!",1351900800,,563,4.529411764705882
2928700,5,B000V3JGJ2,I have loved the pink panther from many many years back.  I have never seen this movie.  It was great.  Definitely glad I purchased this for my son!,1347926400,,148,4.214285714285714
2928701,5,B000V3JGJ2,"An enjoyable trip down memory lane to a simpler time of holiday classic animated specials for the entire family to enjoy. The Pink Panther - A Pink Christmas is a masterful collage of animated cartoon holiday fun and ""silent era"" classic storytelling magic. A ""must have"" addition for every classic Holiday DVD Collection enthusiast!",1328486400,,333,5.185185185185185
2928702,3,B000V3JGJ2,"The Pink Panther is alone, cold, and destitute (I guess MGM kept all the profits to his movies then). While wandering the streets of an early 20th century city he devises multiple ways of scrounging himself an Xmas dinner, such as infiltrating a department store and trying to pass himself off as a prisoner (even THEY get a free dinner). Needless to say, all of them fail, leaving Pinky miserable and desperate.

At his lowest moment he shares a discarded donut with a dog, only for an Xmas miracle to happen. It's a very sweet cartoon, but doesn't rate too highly on my list of animated specials. The music consists of mainly the Pink Panther tune fused with a jazz version of 'Jingle Bells'. It gets a bit annoying. Some obscure carols are in there too.

This DVD also features 2 other specials, Olym-Pinks and Pink at First Sight.",1322697600,3,834,4.590604026845638
2928703,5,B000V3JGJ2,My six-year-old is a huge Pink Panther fan and she has seen many of the eppisodes. These were new and she watched it over and over. Shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition. Thanks!,1305936000,,194,4.416666666666667
2928704,1,B000V3JGJ2,I thought this was the olympics video that I saw on television back in the 80s before the olympic winter games.  It was not the same video.,1296259200,,139,4.148148148148148
2928705,5,B000V3JGJ2,I have shown this video for Christmas parties at school.  About half hour long and the bonus is that all students regardless of the language they speak or don't speak get this.  No dialoge (just like Tom and Jerry cartoons)but a sweet story in the end. The P.P. is hungry and looking for food.  Eventually finds some food and then decides to share it with another character that is equally as down on his luck as he is. My boys said that there were bonus cartoons with this that were not on the original VHS tape we had.,1296172800,,520,4.285714285714286
2928706,4,B000V3JGJ2,My Children absolutely love Pink Panther and this Christmas story will make you laugh and teach a wonderful meaning about what the Christmas season is to your children.  We love it and it will be a constant classic to be played at our house every year.,1294012800,,252,4.478260869565218
2928707,3,B000V3JGJ2,"First - the Christmas portion of this DVD is only 24 minutes of the running length of the feature. I thought I was getting a ""movie"" for the kids but this seems to be either a 30 minute episode or Christmas special. If you have older pink panther DVDs from the 60s and the early 70s you will be disappointed by the animation quality (which on this DVD is crude simplistic 80's cartoon styling) and by the story line in general - especially how the Pink Panther behaves - he is not his usual suave self. Yes - the Pink Panther has been on hard times in other of his cartoons but he manages to get out of the situation quicker and slicker without the use of Deus ex machina... but I digress. Second - the bonus cartoons were just as crude and even less interesting - in fact I am afraid to ask what my kids thought of the DVD in general - perhaps I will be able to judge by the amount of repeat viewings. Are you dying for good Pink Panther - please buy the ""The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection"" and watch the episodes from the 60s.",1259452800,8,1038,4.169154228855722
2928708,5,B000V3JGJ2,"The Pink Panther (as in the cartoon character)'s 1978 Christmas Special saw its official release on DVD in November of 2007.
When I first bought this DVD in late 2007, I was familiar with the Christmas special which I had on VHS but was on last legs and I had seen Pink at First Sight online but hadn't seen Olym-Pinks at all. Before I thought of buying it, at first I was like $14 for only 24 minutes but I was shocked and ecstatic at the same time that MGM/20th Century Fox decided to release the two subsequent Pink Panther TV Specials (1980's Olym-Pinks and 1981's masterpiece Pink at First Sight) on the same DVD as well. All specials were 25 or so minutes in length so almost 80 minutes of The Pink Panther's late 1970s/early 1980s TV specials.
""A Pink Christmas"" first debuted on ABC (US ABC not the Australian counterpart) on December 7, 1978 and was adapted from the old 1906 O. Henry short story called 'The Cop and the Anthem' (makes mention of it in the opening credits) and is a wonderful lesson in counting in what you can have and cannot have in life and being grateful for it. The classic story makes a perfect adaptation to the world of the Pink Panther cartoon character. It's cold and Christmas time and the beloved pink cat is cold and has no food and will go at any costs to have food and shelter for Christmas. In the original book, the character in the short story was trying to get into prison so he can be warm and have food for Christmas. There is one scene where the panther to get himself arrested but requests ignored but all things end merrily at the end.
Then we go over a year and two months later to February of 1980 for Olym-Pinks (also originally aired on ABC). Olym-Pinks cashed in on the 1980 Winter Olympics that were held in Lake Placid, New York that year, and includes a series of classic Winter Olympic games played between Panther and the infamous 'little man' from all of the classic Pink Panther shorts (as the animators and late Friz Freleng referred to him).
Finally we have ""Pink At First Sight"" which aired on ABC on May 10, 1981. It's Valentine's Day and the cat has no love and only 6 cents and finds work as a singing/miming delivery man getting into all sorts of trouble along the way before finding the pantheress of his dreams at the end (I believe this would be the start point of The Pink Panther being a father in the animated series Pink Panther and Sons which debuted in 1984).
The Pink Panther Christmas Special DVD is a superb DVD and the Christmas Special is one of my all time Top 5 favorites (up there with Fat Albert's Christmas Special from 1977, Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales from 1979 (which was made by same animators as A Pink Christmas), A Chipmunk Christmas from 1981 and of course How the Grinch Stole Christmas from 1966).

8216346,5,B000V3JGJ2,"Are you dreaming of a Pink Christmas rather than a White or Green one? The Pink Panther's original 3 primetime TV specials are together on this special DVD, not just his original Christmas special from 1978! A Pink Christmas is based off of O'Henry's story The Cop and the Anthem, which the opening credits state; in which the Pink Panther goes at any lengths to have a good meal and not cause trouble with the law, due to his being a homeless panther in this special. The 2nd special is 1980's The Olym-Pinks, in which the Pink Panther beats the Little Man in every event at the Lake Placid Winter Olym-Pinks of 1980! The last special is for Valentine's Day, Pink at First Sight, from 1981, and one of the last DePatie-Freleng productions before getting absorbed into Marvel; in which the Pink Panther sees his ""dreamgirl"" in any ""dame"" he sees, feeling lonely on Valentine's Day; and ends up using a tape cassette player and tapes in his predicaments with seeing his dreamgirl in human ladies, and even crooks! In 2011, MGM made a flash-animated HD-Widescreen follow-up to the feature program called A Very Pink Christmas, and it aired on Freeform, and never aired there again since, nor has it ever been on DVD, as of 2016! Just 1 year after the original Pink Christmas from UA, Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales from the WB had a similar look and feel to it, while reusing some of its music at times! This makes a great partner to the Pink Panther's Complete Shorts DVD Collection; especially at Christmas, V-Day, or during the Olympics, even the Special Olympics! You're sure to get a bang out of this trio of Pink rarities, unless it's no longer made and sold new on its own, and only in multi-packs with other MGM Christmas stuff! If you're only interested in this one, look carefully on Amazon or eBay and you might find new copies under $10, shipping and handling and all, as of 2016!",1479340800,,1895,4.609467455621302

8216352,4,B000V3JGJ2,"A Pink Christmas is a late 70's Christmas special, courtesy of our pink feline. While watching this, it didn't look or feel like your average animated Christmas special; of course not-it's the Pink Panther! Absent of dialogue (as usual), we're taken on an adventure of mishaps, while ultimately finding the true meaning of Christmas. This special is a mixture of humor and humanity, with the prevailing message being at the forefront. The next episode (Olym-Pinks) is centered around Winter Olympic events in Lake Placid, New York, with the panther getting into all sorts of tangle ups. Fittingly (well, sort of) there's disco music in this one, (which checks out), because this was released in 1980. The final episode (Pink at First Sight) is very quirky, and almost seems like an attempt at a psychedelic mind-altering experience. This one is probably not recommended for the kids, as it depicts infidelity, and like I said, some psychedelia. Overall, this DVD is solid, and really a forgotten gem among animated Christmas specials.",1448236800,2,1034,5.124260355029586
