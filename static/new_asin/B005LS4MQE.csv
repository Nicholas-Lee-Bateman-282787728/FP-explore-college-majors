4830041,5,B005LS4MQE,"I really liked the movie Tuff Turf when it came out and had it on VHS, wanted it on DVD as I had not watched in some time.  Was as good as I remembered.  I had never seen Under the Boardwalk and I enjoyed it as well.  Would defintely recommend to others.",1366156800,,254,3.8461538461538463
4830042,4,B005LS4MQE,"I bought this movie for Kim Richards & it was very good; I like the glamour scenes the best, but it was too violent for my taste at the end",1364256000,,139,3.6666666666666665
4830043,2,B005LS4MQE,"Old movie, the quality on blue ray player and high definition TV is not too exciting to watch and the story of the movie is ok.",1362873600,,127,3.923076923076923
4830044,5,B005LS4MQE,I saw this movie Tuff Turf when I was younger and was very happy to see it available on DVD.  Neat to be able to watch movies I grew up with.  Fast shipping and good product.,1360713600,,174,3.8055555555555554
4830045,4,B005LS4MQE,I wanted the movie Under The Boardwalk and got Tuff Turf at the same time - no reason to complain,1357948800,,97,3.9
4830046,5,B005LS4MQE,"I bought this solely for ""Tuff Turf,"" which, despite bad ratings, is an awesome 80s movie. Don't get me wrong, the Molly Ringwald stuff is good, too, but the style there is a little watered down, whereas in ""Tuff Turf,"" it's full blast. The plot and casting are great, and it doesn't patronize teenagers the way so many movies do now.

""Under the Boardwalk"" was actually pretty good, considering there isn't much on it anywhere. It's not perfect, but it is worth watching, especially if you don't know anything about surfing and the way they used to talk. Very cool.",1355961600,,566,4.66
4830047,5,B005LS4MQE,"I bought this DVD for Under The Boardwalk... I used to watch that movie when I was a young boy. If your a surfer, live by the beach, or just have a heart for the beach, this is a movie to see! Haven't watched Tuff Turf yet, but, that will be done shortly! But, Well worth the buy just for Under the Boardwalk!  CLASSIC!",1345248000,,319,3.984375

4830055,5,B005LS4MQE,I loved Tuff Turf because of two things: a young James Spader and Robert Downey Jr.,1472688000,,83,4.25
4830056,5,B005LS4MQE,Classic!,1471392000,,8,8.0
4830057,5,B005LS4MQE,"I had been waiting for Under the Boardwalk to come out on DVD for a long time, constantly checking to see if it will be released. Eventually I gave up. A few years ago on Christmas, I opened a gift from my sister-in-law and there it was, my own copy on DVD! I didn't even care that it came with another movie. I know it's not a famous movie by any means but there was something about this damn movie that I loved. When I opened the DVD to watch it again, I expected it to be horrible after all these years. Poor quality and all, it was even better than I remembered!  It fulfilled that inner surfer girl that I always wanted to be! So if you're looking for the cheesiest 80's L.A. surfer love story, then this is totally for you! One of these days I will watch Tuff Turf, lol. I'm sure most of you think I'm crazy and probably have no interest or desire to see this but I hope there's someone out there who enjoys it as much as I did!",1470700800,2,934,4.021505376344086
4830058,4,B005LS4MQE,my spouse really liked the movie.,1470528000,,33,4.666666666666667
4830059,5,B005LS4MQE,Awesome,1468800000,,7,7.0
4830060,5,B005LS4MQE,"Tuff Turf is a fantastic 1980s flick.  Not sure why it was never sold to television, as it is so much better than many of the 80s movies that appear on so many cable/dish channels now.  Excellent early acting performances by both James Spader and Robert Downey (you could clearly see how talented he was in his supporting role).  Music is also great, as songs by the punk rock Jim Carroll Band are still solid, catchy, and relevant today.  One of my favorite 80s flicks!",1465430400,,470,4.4941176470588236
4830061,5,B005LS4MQE,Only Tuff Turf was good not under the boardwalk .,1463961600,,49,4.0
4830062,5,B005LS4MQE,Two great cheesy as hell 80's movies. Tuff Turf has to be seen to be believed and James Spader is always excellent. Under the Boardwalk was a pleasant surprise and way more comedy than the drama looking trailer would have you believe. Check em out!,1456012800,,248,4.533333333333333
4830063,3,B005LS4MQE,Only giving 3 stars because I love Tuff Turf. Was great years ago and still holds up. I had never seen Under the Boardwalk and figures it as a bonus. But it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was painful to watch.,1452124800,,227,3.851063829787234

4830066,4,B005LS4MQE,bought for Tuff Turf only because i haven't seen it since the 90's,1432598400,,66,4.153846153846154
4830067,5,B005LS4MQE,"I've been waiting for Under The Boardwalk to come onto DVD for years.  For some reason I just looked it up and saw it.  I immediately bought it.  I told my friend and he bought a copy as well.

I watched it this weekend.  I still liked it  My wife wasn't amused but what does she know?  LOL

If you're looking for an Academy Award nominated movie this is not for you.  But if you are looking for an entertaining cheesy surf movie from the 80s, this is for you.  Some similarities to Northshore and Thrashin' so if you like those, you will like Under the Boardwalk.

I haven't watched Tuff Turf yet but it is just a bonus for me.

It was funny to see a preview for Fatal Attraction aka Heathers.",1432425600,2,694,4.135338345864661

4830085,3,B005LS4MQE,"I got this movie because I was look for one movie that James Spader  did.  This movie ""Tuff Turf"" was okay, but I would of like to seen more action form James. It made me think of the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"", where this kids are always beating him up. He doesn't stand up for himself until the end. As for the other movie it was a waste of time. I found it boring and didn't keep interested.",1390953600,,397,4.012658227848101
4830086,5,B005LS4MQE,"I always loved Under the Boardwalk as a kid. I hadn't seen it in years, so I purchased this. I hadn't seen Tuff Turf in years, either, and I can't say that I'm sorry about that. Tuff Turf is not a great flick. But, Under the Boardwalk is still one of my favorites. It held up pretty well over time.",1387670400,,298,3.9833333333333334

8478475,4,B005LS4MQE,Tuff Turf was a bad acid flash back to the early 1980's. Crop tops and camel toe is what you will get watching this dancing and singing bad acting and a very young Robert downey Jr. With the Jr. dropped. :),1503446400,,206,4.048780487804878
