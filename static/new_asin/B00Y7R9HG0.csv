8717613,5,B00Y7R9HG0,"This magnificent set includes six Chaney bon mots,and they are:He who gets Slapped(released Nov/24),Mockery(released Aug/27),The Monster(released Mar/25),Mr. Wu(released Mar/27),The Unholy Three(released Aug./25)and The Unholy Three(released July/30).
Chaney not only specialized in grotesques characters physically(thus the moniker""Man of a 1,000 faces""),but also in morals,i.e dysfunctionals. His characters were more often than not trying obtain the unobtainable,with Chaney paying the ultimate price either physically or mentally. These weren't your average actor's roles,which is why he stood out,because he did them so well.
He Who Gets Slapped has Lon as a scientist who makes a major breakthrough,only to have his benefactor take the credit. He is broken mentally and joins a circus act (his new name is He)which has caught on fire with the public. He is a clown who,the more he gets slapped,the wilder the crowd reaction. In the end he gets his revenge on his old benefactor and the father of a girl who he has fallen in love with. This is typical Chaney and he carries his character well. Up and comers John Gilbert and Norma Shearer are on hand to add to the festivities. 4- 4 1/2 stars.
Mockery has Lon as a Russian peasant during the Revolution who escorts(unbeknownst to him) a Countess to Novokursk. He is beaten on route trying to protect her and this endears him to the countess who gives him a job in the home at which she ends up staying at. However fellow servants prey on his mind,filling it with all sorts of rubbish on equality. When the Cossacks invade and temporarily drive the soldiers away, Chaney comes on to the Countess. He fails,just as the soldiers return. When the Countess's boyfriend(a soldier) asks whether Chaney is good or bad,the Countess pretends nothing has happened .A weak script plagues this film, but Chaney makes the most of his character,which is,as always,compelling. 3-3 1/2 stars.
The Monster. The story here centers around the town milquetoast(Johnny) who loves the heroine(that he can't get)and is a budding detective. People are disappearing outside of town. At one such incident Johnny picks up a clue on a paper that points to the local asylum that has been closed for at least a couple of months. Johnny follows a strange individual one night through the countryside and comes upon his love and her boyfriend who get kidnapped,and even Johnny finds himself trapped with his friends...inside the Asylum! It is run by Lon,who has some strange assistants. The trio try to escape and/or survive. In the end the secret is uncovered and Lon is dead. This is a surprisingly scary film! This is one of those turn the lights down and get your popcorn out types. I was on the edge of my seat. The film starts out light hearted and moves into tense and suspenseful. 4 1/2 stars.
Mr. Wu. Lon is seen first as a youngster whose teacher is a European,then he is grown up and becomes a mandarin. His wife,who died in child birth,gave birth to only one daughter. His daughter has a pre arranged wedding coming up, but she has secretly not only fallen in love with a European, but is pregnant. Wu finds out and,as tradition dictates,kills her. Bereaved he seeks revenge on the boy who impregnated his dead daughter, and his mother. He holds the son and his sister hostage. The mother must choose between them which will live or die?.Which one will she choose? For the time,this is quite the topic for a movie to probe. It is really a wonder it got made,for that reason alone. Another would be the lead character(Chaney) being Chinese. None of them shouting big box office. But it works. 3 1/2-4 stars.
The UnHoly Three(/25).The silent version  focuses on first a couple,Chaney and his girlfriend Mae Busch. While Chaney does his ventriloquist act,Busch scours the crowd and gathers pocket books,watches and anything a pick pocket can get. The two get involved with the circus strong man and midget. Chaney has a scheme to set up a bird shop as a front,dressing as an old lady as the proprietress,the midget as a baby and the strongman as their helper. Busch helps with the customers ,as does a gentleman they hire,who falls in love with Busch. In fact it becomes a two way street. Chaney lets Busch know in no uncertain terms how he feels about her two timing him. Christmas eve rolls around and the trio are planning a heist at one of their most recent customers home. The hired man shows up with Busch and a Christmas tree in toe,to decorate. This kyboshes Chaney's efforts to leave with his compatriots ,and they go off by themselves. Next morning the paper headlines tell the morbid story:to get the jewels the two got,they ended up killing the owner and severely injuring a youngster. Chaney is incensed. Killing was never part of the plan,while the two mock the home owner as he pleaded for his life. That night they plant the jewels in the clerks room(Chaney is not good with it),who gets the blame for the crime. Just before the police get there to interrogate them,they hi tail it out. Chaney takes along a big ape from the store, as an insurance policy against the strong man.
They retreat to a mountain cabin. While there tensions mount between the guys and also between Busch and Chaney. The latter two have a heart to heart,but as tensions mount Chaney loses it and slaps Busch,leaving a mark on her face. Busch says she will never see the clerk she loves again if Chaney will make things right. He walks away confused. Chaney's conscience gets the better of him and he returns to the city and the court room, where the clerk is under trial. Things are looking bleak. He writes a secret note to the clerk to get up on the stand, while he throws his voice to him,but it fails. Just as the judge dismisses the jury to deliberate the case ,Chaney can take no more and stands up and stops everything. He stands before the judge and confesses all. Meanwhile back at the cabin the strong man has been trying to persuade Busch to come away with him and split the money. The midget is mad and releases the ape on the strongman. The strongman kills the midget,then the ape kills the strongman as Busch flees to get help.
The film ends as Busch meets up with Chaney back at the circus. The law went easy on him for his confession,and Busch is there to honour her agreement to be with him for what he did. Chaney tells her to go where she belongs, and a tearful Busch leaves,while Chaney,shortly thereafter ,resumes his circus act. This film is a tour de force for Chaney and his fellow actors. The premise is surprisingly compelling, and the story of a bad man going right is well done. The scene of Chaney slapping Busch still packs a wallop. You don't see the slap,just the result. 4 1/2 stars.
The Unholy Three(/30).This is the talkie version of the above silent. It has two main differences in plot. There is a lesser emphasis on Chaney's jealousy over his girlfriends crush on the clerk(Busch isn't in this). And the court room scene differs as Chaney actually takes the stand as the old lady he portrayed in the store,getting unmasked by the prosecutor,THEN making a confession. The sound film is 73 minutes while the silent ran around 86 minutes. While it is compelling hearing Chaney talk(his voice fit him well),the director chose to hang on Chaney's reaction shots a bit too long at times,making it look more melodramatic and slower in tone than it needed to be. But again,Hollywood was still in the early stages of talkies and getting their feet and heads around being more naturalistic. Not to mention the cameras being in big boxes and the mic in a fixed position. The bottom line is it doesn't have the impact of the silent,but to hear Chaney talk,and the only film he did so in,and his last,it is still something to see. And that slap?....impactful. 3 1/2 stars.
In conclusion this is a must own set for any silent film buff and/or Chaney fan. Get yours before they are gone.",1515888000,2,7932,4.73121387283237

8717615,4,B00Y7R9HG0,"Lon Chaney: The Warner Archive Classics Collection is  a DVD set containing 5 of the actors silent feature films and the only sound film he made, The Unholy Three, a remake of Chaneys 1925 silent version, which is also in the collection.

Chaney worked as an extra and appeared in small featured roles for two years until making an impression in The Miracle Man (1919). In that film, Chaney twisted himself pretzel-like portraying a crippled man. A highlight of the film occurs when he unwinds himself slowly and dramatically. During this period, he also demonstrated his ability with make-up to transform himself completely into assorted characters. This facility gave him the nickname The Man of a Thousand Faces. Chaney is best known for playing the title characters in the silent versions of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera.

Included in this collection is He Who Gets Slapped (1924), in which Chaney plays a man, despondent over personal issues, who joins a circus sideshow and becomes the most famous clown in France. The film co-stars Norma Shearer. Bela Lugosi makes an uncredited appearance as a clown.

In The Monster (1925), insane Dr. Ziska (Chaney) devises an elaborate scheme to trap human specimens for his bizarre resurrection experiments. Mr. Wu is about a Chinese aristocrat (Chaney) who ruthlessly defends his daughters (Renee Adoree) honor after a wealthy Englishman seduces and abandons her. Mockery (1927), set during the Russian Revolution, focuses on Countess Tatiana Alexandrova (Barbara Bedford) who must leave Siberia and travel to Novokursk, Russia in disguise. She enlists the help of a peasant, Sergei (Chaney), to get her there safely.

In both versions of The Unholy Three (1925 and 1930), a sideshow ventriloquist, Dr. Echo (Chaney), forms an underground trio with a strongman and a midget. Disguised as kindly Mrs. OGrady, a kindly grandmother who runs a pet shop, Echo uses the pet shop as a front to attract wealthy buyers. After casing the homes to which they deliver pets, the team later commits burglaries, with their rich customers as victims. The silent version is directed by Tod Browning (Freaks, Dracula), who would team up frequently with Chaney, directing him in roles requiring both make-up expertise and physical stamina.

There are no bonus features in the 6-disc DVD set.",1497312000,5,2353,5.114583333333333
