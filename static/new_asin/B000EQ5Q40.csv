2529577,4,B000EQ5Q40,"Director Sidney Furie is best known for his work on the Ipcress file. He is back 40 years later with a minimalist masterpiece. I have read the reviews here and elsewhere and they focus their hostility on the fact that the movie was made in Canada with Canadian actors. Canada is the background for perhaps 10% of US films and I have not seen such hostility bruited about these other productions. Perhaps the reviewers thought only Americans could make a movie about Iraq. What strikes me is that Americans have not made a movie about Iraq. It fell to a foreign country to make such a movie and this foreign country made a movie suprisingly flattering to the US.

The film is shot in a Cassavetes-style docu-drama format. American Soldiers follows a platoon's one day patrol in militia infested Baghdad. There is no fat in this movie. Just facts. One has the feel that the movie-makers eschewed commercialism and did their homework in trying to figure out what is really happening in the battle between Americans and Baghdadis. It is not a movie that will please Americans as it shows what an awful, wasterful, meaningless, bloody struggle they have got themselves into, but if one can look past these global aspects of the movie one sees a picture of young Americans brought up on the internet and I-pods coming to terms with brutal realities and making a good show of it.

By staying spare, and avoiding drama the movie is, in my view, perhaps one of the best depictions of the realities of combat.",1154995200,5,1499,4.674242424242424
2529578,1,B000EQ5Q40,"Blood and guts and smouldering, dismembered body parts. Not really my type of entertainment. I hired it before reading the comments of my fellow Amazon critics. Based on fact, it was probably a realistic account of 24 hours in the life of American soldiers in Iraq. Absolute hell by the look of it. The acting was a bit mediocre but it did show what these poor boys have to go through. Nevertheless, I wouldn't watch it again.",1154044800,6,426,4.545454545454546
2529579,1,B000EQ5Q40,"First and foremost...avoid this movie at all costs.  If there is nothing else on TV, then just turn it off and stare at the blank screen.  I was in Iraq in 2003-2004, and I have to say that if you do watch this poor excuse for a ""based on a true story"" war movie, be sure to put on your rubber boots.  It seems as if the director was looking to send out a message, rather than depict a real-life event.  Instead of wasting your two hours on this flick, why not do something more constructive?  You could practice belching ""Oh, Canada"".",1150588800,9,535,4.205882352941177

2529581,3,B000EQ5Q40,"This film is loosely based on actual events stemming from April 2004, the costliest month of US casualties since the declaration of the end of hostilities in Iraq.  It follows a squad of US Army soldiers as they fend off ambush on top of ambush in the tradition of ""Back Hawk Down"".  Surprisingly this low budget Canadian production takes an almost John Wayne approach, emphasising heroism and commraderie.  The cast of virtual unknowns form an unexpected cohesiveness, that this reviewer hopes is instilled in every American infantry unit.  The contradictions are there.  Why are we in Iraq?  We need to be there!  Was it worth loosing all those lives?  Are we appreciated by those we have liberated?  What have we accomplished?  On and on.  The film is very episodic and has annoying breaks inbetween scenes.  Those who want a bangem up, shootem up movie will surely be satisfied.  Director, Sidney Furie has done his best to make the interplay between the troopers seem realistic.  The squad always after quick debate reluctantly does the right thing.  The attitude is we're Americans and we're not like them!  There are a couple conventional subplots that I don't want to give away and spoil it!  WWII, Korea, and ofcourse Vietnam have all had movies made like this.  Why shouldn't Gulf War II?",1148601600,4,1298,4.876146788990826
2529582,1,B000EQ5Q40,"I was compelled to give my 2 cents about this film because it was so pathetic that it's only worth that much in rental fees (at best).  Believe it or not I was actually PAID to watch this film and I want those 2 hours of my life back!  Suprisingly (well, not really suprisingly), this film was directed by Sidney J. Furie - the man responsible for the abominable Superman IV: The Quest For Peace - which not only explains the lack of direction of this misguided propagandist train wreck, but is a testament to his career as a film maker that went even further downhill after the franchise-killing Superman IV when its budget was slashed in half by the bankrupt Cannon Films to directing this SUPER low-budget catastrophe.

This film was shot entirely on location in Ontario and it is supposed to take place in Iraq! LOL! It's so obvious that the crew dressed a small rural farm town in Canada (evident from the visible grain, not oil, refinery in the distance) to ""double"" for a mid-east location by spray-painting Arabic graffiti in alleyways and on the sides of buildings and re-using the same 3 fake palm trees repeatedly placed in shot compositions and making extensive use of smoke machines to simulate dust clouds. The cinematography makes extensive use of filters to make daylight appear tinted with rustic hues to evoke a Black Hawk Down style atmosphere. I was more entertained by whatever ""cleverness"" the production team could concoct with their low-budget mimicry (LOL!) than I was engaging in the plot (if there even was one).

This film is nothing more than a sophomoric exercise in amateur low-budget film making with grown men playing Cowboys and Indians (in this case it's Grunts and Arabs) dressed up in desert military camouflage driving around the same war-torn Canadian, er... Iraqi town and getting ambushed by stereotypical terrorists dressed to the nines wearing raggedy turbans and ski masks and firing AK-47's and RPGs at them. It's as though this film was made as a pathetic excuse to shoot and kill a bunch of Islamic terrorists as cathartic retribution for the atrocities of 9-11. If you want to see a FAR more dramatic and big-budget approach to the war on terrorism, watch Jack Bauer on 24 instead of this tripe.",1147305600,15,2243,4.7881136950904395
2529583,4,B000EQ5Q40,"I liked the movie because of the non-robotic soldiers who have a conscious, thus the story.  The movie does seem to take cinematic license to the number of attacks and lack of support, but it does not distract from the storyline.  Do the soldiers always follow what they have been taught -- no, but that's actually reality.  I've had to yell at my own soldiers during combat to get them to focus.  Well worth a viewing and not the same old action flick.",1259712000,,453,4.421686746987952
2529584,5,B000EQ5Q40,"this is a great movie! i think it shows somewhat what war is like. i think i understand how veterans feel once they get home from war. this movie also helped me figure out why we're in iraq, to give the iraqi friendlies freedom and a chance of survival.",1232236800,,253,4.183673469387755
2529585,1,B000EQ5Q40,"Wow, the acting was unconvincing, the dialogue was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous.  Even if you were desperate for entertainment I wouldn't recommend this movie.  Why bother to argue about the message of the movie when the movie itself was so poorly executed.  Watch ""Generation Kill"" instead.  It at least has some real soldiers playing soldiers and giving direction/assistance.",1216684800,,386,5.383333333333334
2529586,1,B000EQ5Q40,"just horrible. did not know middle east had the same vegetation of canada? That is the ""good"" problem. Acting, directing, and stupidity are the real problems. ""so if the shi* goes down so be it"" and ""No buts thats and order"" such realism and awesome dialogue!

Also what a title. That must have taken years!

No life or commen sense in this crap of a movie. I hate war movies that have no life. Sorry guys but it bothers people when their friends and fellow soldiers are hurt or killed. They have a job to do but to go on with the trying to be witty FRIENDS, the tv show, style comments just falls less than flat.

Do not rent or see this. just hit your head on wall for a few hours and you will be better off. ""so why they mad we here?"" "" because nobody likes to be occupied because it is like living with your parents"" ACADEMY AWARD FOR WRITING HERE WE COME!",1211673600,,860,4.137724550898204
2529587,3,B000EQ5Q40,"I came upon this movie while searching for something of interest to watch on TV. I had missed about a quarter of the movie but was intrigued by the action sequences. It is a fast passed action movie. I did not think it was all true but neither was it all fiction. If this is an honest portrayal of the war going on in Iraq, I feel for our soldiers who are stationed there.",1205193600,,372,4.04054054054054
2529588,3,B000EQ5Q40,"the films action sequences are good but thats pretty much all the it has going for it. Based on the war in Iraq, it follows a team of US Soldiers into battle against the terrorists. Its a rent first movie.",1198108800,,205,4.15
2529589,1,B000EQ5Q40,"I expected this to be a ""B"" movie but was sorely disappointed.  Sidney tries to make both political and ethical statements but fails pathetically.  These efforts just bludgeon what little semblance of a plot there is.  He was trying to make a point and did.  He should have stopped making movies with The IPCRESS File (great movie).  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1189900800,,377,4.651515151515151
2529590,1,B000EQ5Q40,"Under the suggestion of a filmmaker friend of mine, I thought I'd give this film a tumble.

What I found was a film depicting soldiers acting and talking unprofessionally, and discussing political screeds that front line soldiers never talk about, especially when under fire.

In fact the characters talk too much. They talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about crap no soldier in his right mind would ever talk about.

The acting was atrocious.

A combat medic complaining about being a medic? I was a combat medic, and that just never happens.

It had occasional good action scenes, but over all it was really a horrible film.

Guys like Furie should leave the writing and making of modern war films to guys who have either actually served in that conflict or at least done some serious ""real"" research about soldiers and modern warfare and the conflict they are writing about.

Man, I miss guys like John Ford.",1185926400,9,906,4.769230769230769
2529591,5,B000EQ5Q40,Few war movies give the American soldier his due like this one.  These are not the blood-thirsty crazed killers or the cynical nihlists that hollyweird seems so fond of portraying.  These are men who see an injustice and stick their necks out to do what is right when the world is wrong.  It is a must-see for anyone interested in the Iraqi war and for anyone interested in an America that stands for something and strives to make a difference even in the face of political folly.  The acting is a little cheesy but the story is full of pathos.  Get it today and be proud that there are still young men like these willing to risk it all for what they know in their hearts to be right.,1166745600,7,684,4.271317829457364
2529592,5,B000EQ5Q40,"Amongst a small but vocal section of our wonderful society, only two depictions of US soldiers suffice, cruel or dumb-(misled dumb or just plain dumb). American Soldiers refreshingly avoids these stereotypes and portrays soldiers as complicated moral agents in a complicated situation. AS is the third quality small-budget, DVD-only war movie I've seen in a row. The story involves a squad of American soldiers plus one or two friendly Iraqi policemen experiencing one single hellish day. The day starts off with an ambush followed by an IED, then what seems to be a conglomeration of iraq war headlines-car bombings, torture, everything. It's kind of like Black Hawk Down, but I didn't notice the resemblance until just now. Some of the dialogue is near cringe-inducing, involving war ruminations and summations of the points of view of which you've no doubt grown sick. American Soldiers held my interest throughout and passed the normal-person test as Patti thouroughly enjoyed it. The movie contains one of the best endings in a war movie, and the producers were definately advised well as all of the props, military terms, and situations were spot-on. American Soldiers gets a bonus star for being the only normal Iraq war movie available, as far as I know.

8113231,2,B000EQ5Q40,"A disappointing movie.  For as much as happened in the movie excitement wise, it wasn't a very exciting movie.

Perhaps I looked at it all wrong.  I was no ground pounder in my military years, I spent 20 years in the Navy.  I just could NOT fathom that much crap happening to the same squad/platoon of guys as this movie depicts.  Every time they got out of one firefight they were back in another.  It MIGHT have happened, but it sure doesn't seem feasible, logical or even piss-poor bad luck.

The actual film making seemed more to fit a television show than a movie.  I kept waiting for ""and now a word from our sponsor"" after the fades to black.  I tried and tried to keep an open mind.  Sorry folks, this movie was a waste of time.

The ONLY reason I marked it UP to a 2* movie is because it tried to portray our young soldiers not as war mongers and heroes all, but of humans and real people.",1402704000,,898,4.192982456140351
