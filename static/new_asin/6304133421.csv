7864319,5,6304133421,"This Directoral Debut of Dan Mirvish is a great movie for anyone who has ever passed through Omaha in their lives.  I am currently living here, and even though this movie is now 11 years old, I find still a very acurate description of the state of Nebraska.  Sure, the Aksarben race track is demolished, and there are a few new buildings on the skyline downtown, the charm of the movie, and the statistics, facts, and trivia that is rattled off throughout the movie are all propaganda that I actually heard as ""reasons I will love it here"" from people in passing.  The sterotype ""Husker"" fans is dead on.

  Cameo appearences from Then Govenor, now Senator Ben Nelson, The mayor of Omaha, and the UNO chancelor Delbert Weber add to the charm of this film.  The locations of the Antiquarium (still downtown alive and kicking), The Stockyards, Henery Dorley ZOO, and Carhenge are all cool to see in a film preserved for all time here in their pristine glory, and the way they actually are.  It is actually a funny movie, and a very good entry level, fresh out of college film with a strong script and sense of irony.  Also, I love the plug for Cedar Rapids, Iowa, my home town.  Everyone who has been to Omaha, ended up in Omaha, or have always been in Omaha need to see this film and laugh it up.",1152057600,3,1295,4.4261603375527425

Director Dan Mirvish is a co-founder of the Slamdance Film Festival.

Runtime: 85 minutes

Dan Mirvish may be best known as one of the co-founders of Slamdance, the alternative film festival in Park City that supports first-time independent directors in the way that Sundance did years ago. He's a filmmaker in his own right, though. While his classmates at USC were churning out unmemorable shorts with decades-old Bolexes, Mirvish set out to write, direct, and produce a feature film on 35mm. As you could probably guess from the title in big, bold letters preceding this paragraph, that film was Omaha: The Movie.

Simon has been driven so nuts by his bland, TV-obsessed family and mankind's overreliance on technology that he decides to leave his lifelong home of Omaha behind. He doesn't find his spiritual center in Nepal as he'd hoped, dismayed that the Buddhist monks chose to waste away their days watching monster trucks on satellite television. After giving him a gift of sacred prayer stones, the monks send Simon on his way, and he continues his quest on several continents for the spiritual enlightenment he so desperately craves. His search proves to be fruitless, and when his savings run dry, a defeated Simon returns home to Nebraska. It's not long before he runs into Gina, a crazed former girlfriend with a penchant for taking as many courses at the University of Nebraska Omaha as time will allow. Gina's stint in Gemology was enough for her to be able to identify Simon's beloved prayer stones as emeralds, which should net enough money for him to continue his search across the few areas of the world he's left untouched. Strapped for cash and almost immediately sacked from his telemarketing gig, Simon relents and heads with Gina to the mall for an appraisal. A jeweler refers him to wholesalers in Denver, though he has his own agenda. Colombian jewel thieves are hot on their trail, resulting in a battle to the finish in Carhenge.

For nearly the entire length of the film, I had an unremovable smirk on my face. I haven't felt the need to gush so much about this sort of independent comedy since I caught Joe's Rotten World at a Charleston film festival back when I was in high school. (As a wild, exciting coincidence, Joe's Rotten World joined Omaha: The Movie as one of the films screened at the inaugural Slamdance in 1995.) Its offbeat sense of humor is very much in line with my own. Take this description of one fairly early scene: as Colombian jewel thieves watch on, Gina spins around in a barber's chair and uses Tae Kwan Do to fend off a roving gang of Iowan kickboxers. That sentence alone should give some indication of what kind of film Omaha is. Despite featuring a station wagon car chase and handwritten subtitles/intertitles, the humor is kept just short of surreal, not seeming as if it's wacky merely for the sake of wackiness. Omaha is an attractively shot film, and thanks in part to the talent behind the camera and the use of 35mm short ends, it certainly doesn't look like a $38,000 production. A slew of actors and inexperienced locals (including mayor P.J. Morgan and governor Richard Roth) contribute their talents, and Jill Anderson's manic performance as Gina is perhaps the film's greatest asset.

Omaha: The Movie is a unique and often very funny film that almost defies classification. -- Adam Tyner, DVDTALK.COM",1106697600,6,3596,4.867647058823529
