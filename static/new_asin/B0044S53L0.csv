8416288,5,B0044S53L0,Excellent visuals of period climbing techniques and you get the feel of attitudes  people held for alpinists during the golden age of mountaineering. Compare scenes from Zermatt in this film to scenes from Third Man on the Mountain. Similar buildings and landmarks-filmed 20 years later!,1427587200,,287,5.377777777777778
