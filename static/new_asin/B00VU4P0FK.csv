8711255,1,B00VU4P0FK,"This was a terrible video.  It is supposed to be about the Tambo, but Dr. Stelzer talks more about escrima than any Japanese arts.  The sound, lighting and background were terrible and Dr. Stelzer did not use another person to demonstrate the techniques.  The stick forms were done in a very amateurish manner.  For a 10th degree his technique is terrible. Thank goodness this video didn't cost anymore than it did.  I won't be buying anymore videos from this individual.",1481932800,,471,4.8375
