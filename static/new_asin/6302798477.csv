513058,5,6302798477,"I'd always read that this film's only asset was being the movie in which Mae West made her screen debut, and having seen it, I can say that that's untrue and absolutely unfair. West is in top & rare (different from her subsequent stereotyped love goddess persona) form as Maudie, Raft's old flame and friend, and her scenes are very funny, but that's only part of it. George Raft plays the lead as the owner of a Speakeasy who longs for things that money alone can't buy: prestige, class, a worthy lady-wife and going up the social ladder. He hires wonderful Alison Skipworth as a teacher, in order to learn the manners + way of the upper classes (her hangover scene with miss West is a gem). Raft also falls for very pretty Constance Cummings, who's good in her part of the impoverished socialite. Noteworthy performances too by Wynne Gibson (who physically resembles the young Miriam Hopkins, who was also a Paramount star in that period of time), as the vulgar and cheap floozy in love with Raft (who wants to get rid of her at any price!) and by Roscoe Karns as his loyal sidekick. Also in it, great character actor Louis Calhern as Cummings' rich suitor. In all a very pleasent, entertaining and very well acted movie, unjustly neglected and overlooked for decades, and merely dismissed as ""Mae West's first picture"". It's much more than just that kids.",1013385600,14,1358,4.6625

513060,4,6302798477,"This is the film in which 39 year - old Broadway star Mae West made her debut in motion pictures; like co-star George Raft once said ""She stole everything but the cameras"". Alison Skipworth is hilarious as Mabel Jellyman and when she is taking nips with Mae, she asks ""Maudie, what do you think I should do with my inhibitions?"" to which Mae replies ""Well, honey, I've got an old trunk over here""! When Mae asks Mabel to get into her ""racket"" which is one of ""the best payin' around"" (Maudie has her own chain of beauty parlours called ""Institute de Beaut"") Mabel mistakenly thinks Maudie's talking prostitution and answers ""Well, dontcha think I'm just a little old""? Not a great movie by any means, it comes alive only when Mae appears on screen. ""Night after Night"" is the name of the speakeasy in which the movie takes place.",947289600,2,829,4.570469798657718

7831339,5,6302798477,"Night After Night is a George Raft film and it is pretty good until Mae West show up. Then it becomes hers. Wow ! Mae says the funniest line when asked,Do you believe in love at first sight? She replies Well I don't know but it sure saves a lot of time.  Mae West will NEVER be forgotten.",1361145600,,288,3.9655172413793105
7831340,5,6302798477,"Night After Night might have been completely forgotten if it were not Mae West's feature film debut; but make no mistake about it--this film has a lot going for it in addition to the great casting of Mae West. The acting is very convincing; both the choreography and the cinematography work well and the musical score enhances the film. Moreover, the plot moves along at a very good pace.

When the action starts, we quickly see a mansion that is sold at public auction--to Joe Anton (George Raft), who opens a speakeasy there with his right hand man Leo (Roscoe Karns). Although Joe is making plenty of money, he has his share of problems. He can't seem to get rid of his nagging, clingy and neurotic ex-girlfriend Iris Dawn (Wynne Gibson); another group of mobsters knows Joe's taken away all their business so they want to buy him out--or else; and Joe is can't stop wondering who is that elegant woman who comes alone each night to drink, never showing any interest in a man (Constance Cummings playing Miss Jerry Healy). Joe is also sick and tired of running a speakeasy and he wants to climb up the social ladder and become part of high society.

To start climbing up the ladder and possibly sell off the speakeasy, Joe hires Miss Mabel Jellyman (Alison Skipworth) to teach him the proper ways of speaking and familiarize him with the political issues of the day. Joe also introduces himself to the mysterious Jerry Healy; and we find out why she has been frequenting the speakeasy. However, as Joe and Jerry become more and more interested in each other, complications of all sorts ensue. Rival gangsters turn up the heat even more on Joe. Iris still gets in Joe's way while yet another of Joe's old flames, Maudie Triplett (Mae West), suddenly reappears at the speakeasy.  What is supposed to be a romantic dinner for Joe and Jerry turns into something else altogether when Mabel gets quite drunk and forgets Joe's signal to leave them alone--and Maudie tells stories about the past which embarrasses Joe in front of Jerry who he really wants to impress. It even gets to the point where Iris confronts Joe and Jerry with a loaded gun!

Of course, how all this plays out remains the focus of the movie. Look also for fine performances by Louis Calhern as Dick Bolton, the man Jerry just might marry instead of Joe Anton; Bradley Page as gangster Frankie Guard and Tom Kennedy as Tom the bartender in Joe's speakeasy.

I highly recommend Night After Night for fans of the actors in this film and people who like gangster dramas with comedy thrown in for a great effect. In addition, fans of racy pre-Code films will not be disappointed.",1346889600,3,2642,4.6488222698072805
7831341,4,6302798477,"As was customary in early talkies, there are long musicless stretches in NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, unless logic calls for it. Much of the action unfolds at a fancy speakeasy; its orchestra can be heard playing a catalog of PARAMOUNT related tunes such as ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" ""Mimi"" and ""Isn't It Romantic.""

Here, George Raft is the nattily dressed but rough-edged ""speak"" owner who's looking to divest of the fancy saloon and move up in society. Toward this aspiration he receives regular tutelage from Alison Skipworth, whose soft spoken society matron contrasts sharply with her more familiar blowsy, overbearing dame roles.

Although Raft doesn't play a gangster in this first starring vehicle, his character is closely associated with them and uses the lingo. The love triangle he gets entangled in has one extra angle to it, an actress who steals every scene she's in. Infatuated with Park Avenue lady Constance Cummings, George is not yet free of a gal with as many rough edges as his own, Wynne Gibson. Her needy whining quickly turns to thoughts of violence when Raft instructs assistant Roscoe Karns to eject the overloud Gibson from his club. She manages to wheedle off the hook, grabs a pistol and goes hunting for her ex, which brings us to another hard-as-steel former lover, Mae West (in the first of a dozen movies).

Her attitude about an affair that's ended is far healthier than Gibson's. A good time gal through and through, Miss West supplies this drama's most amusing moments, with crackling self-penned dialogue (the only one of four scripters to receive no screen credit). Every second Mae is in the story is memorable; she is in fact the primary reason this old picture is remembered today.

There's several dramatic highlights, including the inevitable confrontation between pistol-packin' Gibson and hard to rattle Raft. With a predictble plot, this pre-Code programmer is still sure to please all fans of early Depression Era cinema.

7831342,5,6302798477,I think this film is a hoot!  I love Mae West as Maudie Triplet. She is lovable. The movie is very hysterically funny in parts. I could watch it over and over again and it always makes me laugh.,1186963200,2,194,3.9743589743589745
7831343,4,6302798477,"This pre-code film might draw you in because of Mae West, but it will make you a fan of George Raft. Night After Night is the story of a man who runs a speakeasy (Raft). He finds himself in a bind when another gang in town wants to buy him out or bump him off. He isn't worried, but when he meets a beautiful high class girl who he sets out to marry (Constance Cummings), he plans to sell for enough money to take care of her. However, in comes his old flame (West) who is by no means cautious when it comes to demolishing the good impression he is trying to make on his potential wife.

West is brash and realistic in this film, but her part is much smaller than her later starring roles. She has some great lines though and some revealing costumes.

Raft is wonderful in this film. His usual gangster character is enlightened by love; in scenes where he is innocently eager and lovestruck, he is incredibly likable.

There are some scandalous elements in this film. We see Raft's naked hip as he steps into the bathtub, West in a loose, revealing nightgown, prostitution references, and a kiss that does not entail love.

This tape also includes a theatrical trailer for the film.",1136073600,5,1182,4.408256880733945
