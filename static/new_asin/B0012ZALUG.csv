8248458,1,B0012ZALUG,"I bought this edition because I wanted a DVD of DREAMCHILD.  The transfer was so bad (possibly a VHS to DVD copy, and full-screen!) that I threw the disk away. I have no idea how good or bad CRIMINAL AFFAIR was because I never got that far.

Fortunately, Amazon now can supply (on demand) a 16:9 wide-screen DVD-R copy of this truly mesmerizing film.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamchild/dp/B002Y26UMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamchild</a>&nbsp;It's a beautiful transfer.  Almost as good as a studio-issued DVD.  Although Amazon warns that the DVD-R disk probably won't play on DVD recorders, I've had no problems playing it on my two Panasonic multi-region recorders (both aged now, but still going strong).",1349913600,3,761,5.954128440366972
8248459,3,B0012ZALUG,"Be aware that this two-movies-on-one-disc DVD is watchable but definitely not ""DVD quality.""  I bought it for ""Dreamchild,"" which apparently was mastered here from a videotape source.  Horizontal VHS-type glitches go past at a couple of points, the colors are muddy and the sound isn't exactly pristine. Also, the movie is presented in full-frame format, not widescreen.  I haven't watched the other movie on the disc yet (""Criminal Affair""), but a quick skim through part of it revealed that its picture and sound quality are similarly unsatisfying.  The ""Dreamchild"" movie, written by Dennis Potter, would have been worth at least a four-star rating.  But the disappointing quality of the presentation here has to be taken into account, even though no other legitimate DVD version of the movie currently exists.",1262304000,2,813,5.271317829457364
