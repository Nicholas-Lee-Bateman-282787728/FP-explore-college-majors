475864,4,6302530121,"Much more reserved than a Monty Python film but Palin's humor is excellently dry in this unique film about a strained married couple during post war WW II England that was stil experiencing shortages, particularly meat. Palin plays a podiatrist married to Maggie Smith, who obviously and reluctantly settled for him as opposed to a more, in her mind, prestigious physician or other socially upward chap. As post war England is still in the midst of a severe meat shortage, requiring rationing, those with meat are much higher up the social ladder and become the ""in crowd"". And on the flip side, those who suddenly possess meat, whether through legal means or otherwise, can procure money, sex or other special favors. Palin playing the severely reprimanded husband can never seem to please his wife, or have the benefits of any affection what so ever, stumbles across a pig and suddenly his stock rises in the eyes of his wife. One of the funniest scenes is Smith's matter of fact reference to sex that both astonishes and paralyzes Palin as apparently those privileges were severely limited, if granted at all, and perhaps prior inquiries were met with severe abuse. Hence Palin's shock at the mere mention of the possibility. There is a very minor touch of nudity in a limited but humorous sexual scene so for a reasonably mature audience.",1215129600,3,1342,4.864628820960698
475865,5,6302530121,"This is such a good and well crafted film, it is difficult to accept that it is also a very factual history lesson.

The setting is a small North of England town in 1947. Although WW2 has been over for 2 years, Socialism has greedily kept its iron, war-time hand, on the country as a whole. Shortages are severe and restrictions are strict. Food rationing is still very much in force and government inspectors are plentiful.

The upcoming wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip prompts the local 'big-wigs' to engage in actions that are far from legal, in an attempt to hold a civic feast to mark the occasion. A newcomer to the community (Palin), while carrying out his chiropodist's function with much success, doesn't 'fit in' with the local dignitaries - in particular, with the Local Doctor (Denholm Elliott).

After a series of odd - and  often hilarious - escapades, Palin and his Class obsessed wife (Maggie Smith) find themselves invited to the civic feast after all.

This film is a true gem of English film humour and genuine acting talent. As a social history of England and its class-conscious society, prior to (say) 1970, it is of the greatest interest and veracity.

The acting, throughout, is first rate and Richard Griffiths, Pete, Postlethwaite and Bill Paterson give exemplary performances as they lead a very talented cast of extras.",1180051200,4,1362,4.874458874458875
475866,4,6302530121,"The Alan Bennett-scripted A Private Function is an amusing tale about a chiropodist's attempt to steal a pig in post-WWII Yorkshire. Michael Palin is the longsuffering husband whose wife, Maggie Smith, wants to eat pork and move up in the world during a time when rationing was still in force, and the market for illicit meat was booming.

Eventually Palin and rival pig-thief Richard Griffiths, looking surprisingly porcine himself, fall in love with the hapless swine.

This is an often very funny look at postwar Britain from a unique perspective. It boasts a stellar cast that also includes Denholm Elliot, Tom Postlethwaite, Bill Paterson, Alison Steadman and Liz Smith.",1109980800,3,675,5.18348623853211
475867,4,6302530121,"It's all about the Princess and the Pig in this bleak black comedy, which takes place in war-rationed England, circa 1947. The princess, only in a peripheral story, is Elizabeth; and the pig, who takes front and center, is Betty, a sow who's being illegally fatted for slaughter. She gets a second chance at life when someone (Michael Palin) steals her. Very dark comedy, not for the light-hearted!

475868,5,6302530121,"Michael Palin of Monty Python and 'Fish Called Wanda' fame teams up with Maggie Smith ('Prime of Miss Jean Brodie', 'Room With a View', 'Gosford Park') to form one of the most eccentric married couples in English history. To top it off, the couple live with her mother played by the acctress who portrays the eccentric female vestry member (always knitting and creating strange kitchen concoctions) in the 'Vicar of Dilby' series.
Palin is ""foot doctor"" who spends his days bicycling from house to house in post-War II Yorkshire tending to female patients. In his travels around and about he crosses paths with a syndicate of ""business men"" who are raising an illegal pig for a ""private function"" to be held the day the Princess Elizabeth (II) marries.
Following a farcical turn of events, Palin kidnaps the pig named ""Betty"" planned for the roast. Urged on by Smith's character (pure Maggie), the couple ""keep"" the pig in their bathroom and try to kill it. Soon enough, the syndicate members discover the kidnapping and are hot on the tail of the missing pig. In the meantime, a zealous copper is hot on their tails.
Other wonderful actors in this romp include Denholm Elliot ('Room With a View'), Alison Steadman ('Singing Dectective', 'Pride and Prejudice'), Pete Postlehwaite ('Name of the Father', 'Brassed Off') and other very familiar faces. An uplifting film, but not suitable for those who are weak of stomach.",1071360000,8,1419,4.941422594142259
475869,5,6302530121,"What a surprise that this perfect gem is not better known...such a loss. Britain during the early fifties had much to look forward to and much still to do. Everything was still rationed just as in the war years principally because the treasury was sacked to pay for the arms and munitions needed to fight it. The Empire (or what was left of it) was broke too and most that had not already done so went the autonomous route now, taking revenue away from London...though all quite peaceably and with everyone's best wishes. It would be ten years after the war ended (that makes roughly fourteen in all) until rationing would end for these isles, celebrated with the fantastic Festival of Britain in 1955, and people could at last look forward into a new Elizabethan age, rather than back on that darkness. My god Britain paid for that war in every way possible...really. What a period then to set a comedy I suppose...except that this particular story required those lean and austere times for the telling of it. Fresh meat you see...gammon, bacon, joints roasted and slavered with apple sauce...mouth watering! Imagine then the lengths you might go to for some of that after, let's say, eleven years of powdered egg.
Michael Palin as the hen pecked chiropodist, Maggie Smith as the social climbing hen, Liz Smith as the batty scatty mother-in law who'll stuff virtually anything and everything in her gannet gob, Denholm Eliot (as the doctor) who refuses to be impressed and so must be made so...along with everyone else in town who matters....I have never laughed so much. They are all that generation who would have been children (more or less) in this time period and all say how they never felt they went without....how they enjoyed their childhood's and wish it could be the same always...when you watch this you can see their point. This film and everyone's performance in it is superb. Please...for your good health and for your better and more cheerful disposition...buy this movie.",1030060800,40,1989,4.835777126099707

475909,4,6302530121,"England of November 1947 was a country still recovering from World War II and chafing under a strict rationing of foodstuffs. November 20 of that year would give those that could the chance to enjoy the romantic pageantry of the Royal wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. This would be one national celebration wherein it was not enough to have the cash to throw a party one had to have connections in the black market.

With this as background A Private Function provides us with a small-scale comedy about upper middle class versus the lower middle-class social climbing. Dame Maggie Smith as the lower middle-class Mrs. Liz Smith has only her own determination and Michael Palin as her the socially oblivious podiatrist husband.  Dominating the social scene in their small town is Dr. Charles Swaby (Denholm Elliott) who is determined to crush a hard-working but ubiquitous foot doctor. Look for Richard Griffiths the future Vernon Dursley serving in a critical supporting role albeit not quite first choice anyone would make for the home team.

The unlikely pivot point for all this middle class action is one illegal, contraband pig. It is the aim of the small-town hierarchy to fatten and serve this contraband when the elite meet to celebrate the Royal wedding. Once the pig becomes part of the podiatrist's household the various comedic complexities will play out.

A Private Function is one of those small-scale mostly low-key comedies that I favor. Some viewers may find it is a little bit too much about piggy private functions and their attendant aromas. If you are looking for roll on the floor funny I don't think this is your movie. If you're looking for comedy in the tradition of the kind they used to make; I can recommend this movie. Many of you will initially judge this as a view one-time movie but I suspect if you added to your collection you will come back to it.",1383350400,2,1899,4.798165137614679

475948,5,6302530121,"This hilarious, off-beat independent comedy is not for everyone, I guess:  one has to transport oneself back in time to the post-WW II era when pork was strictly rationed in England, when chiropodists (Michael Palin) made house calls, and the country (particularly royalist snobs like Denholm Elliott) was in thrall to Princess Elizabeth and her upcoming marriage to Philip.  Out of this rather provincial set of circumstances come a host of comic situations that always leave me delighted.  I had seen the film when it first came out in theaters, noticed that Netflix streams it but doesn't send out copies, and always wanted to inflict it on friends.  At last I can.  It runs the gamut from verbal wit (e.g., the double entendre of the title) to fart jokes. This little film contains the most outrageous (and matter-of-fact!) sex scene in all of filmdom.  Maggie Smith is delicious, and Liz Smith and Richard Griffiths are uproariously funny.

I didn't know how post WWII England was like when it had to ration meat,  especially pork, during it's lean times. The story comes to a funny and entertaining climax at the end. Without giving the story away, I felt sorry for the pig. Although, I just couldn't stop laughing. I highly recommend this movie to adults with a great sense of humor.

475969,4,6302530121,"Rhubarb leaves cause pig flatulation and diarrhea. Just part of the jollification of this story. A private function (dinner) is planned in the leanest of times, when Britain's meat rationing followed WWII, 1947. The humor is quick and sometimes bathroom style. When the illegal pig is discovered by a new local chiropodist, wimpy, hen-pecked Gilbert (Michael Palin-'Monty Python')& snob wife Joyce (Maggie Smith-'Harry Potter' 'Hook' 'Becoming Jane') decide to steal the bacon. Favorite Maggie Smith line: ""Take your clothes off. Strip. There will be blood.""

Dr. Swaby (Denholm Elliott-'Child's Christmas in Wales' 'Scoop' 'Indiana Jones')
CPA Henry (Richard Griffiths-'Pie in the Sky' 'Harry Potter' 'Bleak House')
Farmer Sutcliff (Tony Haygarth-'Emmerdale Farm' 'Chicken Run' 'Bleak House')
Solicitor Frank (John Normington-'Edward the King' 'Atonement''David Copperfield')
Inspector Noble (Jim Carter-'Cranford''The Way we Live Now''Trial & Retribution')
Butcher Nuttol (Pete Postlethwaite-'Inception''The Lost World:Jurassic Park')

Meat Inspector Wormold and green pig painter who wants Doris (Bill Paterson-'Law & Order''the Killing Fields''Little Dorrit''Wives & Daughters''Amazing Grace') is ever the swine sleuth. Mother, age 74, (Liz Smith-'Lark Rise to Candleford''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory') plays her typical dotty old gal. She'll curl your tail.

The cast makes this movie, makes it fun, makes it insanely comical, quirky, ribald, and with only one nude butt scene, unless you count all of those shots of Betty (the pig). See the attempted gassing kill using a kitchen range.
Another great dialogue bit: Swaby about Gilbert ""jaunty, toe-nail clipping little sod. Biking around. You festering, bunyon scrapping, little pillock.""

All this to get a chop dinner celebrating the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and Phillip. Plenty of hamming it up in this DVD. Use your ration stamps, cash, or steal if you have to...but watch once, then flush. Don't forget to wash your hands.",1299283200,6,2041,5.8389261744966445
475970,4,6302530121,"""A Private Function"" is a very funny movie, not classic, but marginally memorable.  It's function is two-fold.  It serves as a ribald account of life in post-war Britain notably rationing and food shortages.  It's also pays homage to the great Ealing comedies of yesteryear.  I was most reminded stylistically of ""Whiskey Galore"" and ""Passport to Pimloco"".  This film, however, takes a harder edge than those films from a gentler time.  There's some food for thought between the laughs.  Imagine for a second housewives reduced to screaming banshees queing up for the last bit of meat that may or not have last seen action at the local racetrack.  Butchers plying their trade taken out in handcuffs by overzealous constables.  Of course there's the inevitable black market cropping up unseen in any democracy.  Oh, yes, everybody's getting ready for the upcoming nuptials between Elizabeth and Philip.  Serious stuff but director Malcolm Mowbray and co-scenarist Allen Bennett leaven it with cheeky humor that's unmistakingly British.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Michael Palin as a gentle podiatrist delegates most of the laughs to Maggie Smith as his brassy wife.  Good work is also done by Liz Smith as Maggie's septugenarian mother who's worried about senility and vets Denholm Elliott and Richard Griffiths as aristocrats trying to purloin the prize pig for their exclusive and very private function.  I'd like to thank the previous reviewer for pointing out the presence of Pete Postlethwaite and his recent demise which I was unaware of.

There's a scene in the kitchen where she has to leap over the rampaging pig that has to be improv.  You can't write and rehearse something that bizarre.  There were moments that I was laughing out loud.  We always think that our own economic times are bad, but things are very bad for these post WW II Brits.  Food shortages, rationing, black market meat.  It's a daily struggle to avoid being humiliated in the food lines.  But Maggie Smith is Maggie Smith.  Michael Palin is also hilarious as her husband.  Their plan to kidnap a nearby pig and butcher it in their house is hysterically funny beyond belief.  There is a splendid supporting cast of famous faces.

There is a bizarre subtitle that still has my mind reeling.  Maggie likes to use foreign phrases (""Da capo, Veronica!"" she often calls to one of her piano pupils), so when she says, ""A bientot"" to some visitors, the subtitle reads ""I'll be on toe.""

Andrews Blu-ray Review: A Private Function is a typically British 1984 absurdly comedy turning a spotlight on class distinctions and social climbing in the UK. Set right after World War II, when there is still strict food rationing, a group of the upper class gentility plan a private feast in honour of HRH Queen Elizabeth II upcoming marriage, all in order to impress the local government. The feast is supposed to consist of pork from an illegally raised pig they have all been contributing their scraps to raise the pig up for fattening for the up and coming Private Function, but when a local podiatrist [Michael Palin] and his wife [Dame Maggie Smith) decide they want in and want a chance to rise up the social ladder, they steal the pig and get way more than theyd bargained for.

""I don't know what the last war was for!"" sputter a number of bitter citizens in A Private Function, a cheerfully caustic comedy skewering British class resentments and social climbing in a small Yorkshire town brimming with conspiracy in 1947. Rationing is still taking a toll on domestic kitchens, but the burg's leading professionals, led by misanthropic Dr. Swaby [Denholm Elliott] are planning an elite banquet to commemorate the impending wedding of Princess Elizabeth. A few rungs down society's ladder, chiropodist Gilbert Chilvers [Michael Palin] bicycles dutifully to his patients' homes, their flying toenail clippings going ping off the ceramics on the mantelpiece, but despite a new office on the main high street, his small-potatoes status in the local pecking order irks his zealously ambitious wife Joyce Chilvers (a deliciously highly-strung Dame Maggie Smith), who squashes his mealtime shoptalk (""Don't bring feet to the table, please"") and leaps at Gilbert Chilvers 's desperate suggestion that they, after being continually turned away at an overrun, understocked butcher shop, steal a pig to upgrade their larder and their profile. ""It's not just pork, its power!"" salivates Joyce.

Unknown to the Chilverses family, their porcine quarry is the unlicensed entr&eacute;e for the royal wedding fete, and the sly lampoons of the film's first half kick into robust slapstick gear as the couple wrestles the oinking beast into their home, lacking the will or expertise to slay it, and the town leaders panic over losing their ill-gotten meat or having their black-market crime discovered. At the offer of a mere two turkeys to replace the kidnapped swine, one bourgeois rage, ""We have 150 people coming, and Jesus isn't one of them!"" The original screenplay by Alan Bennett, a droll jewel of TV and stage since the '60s and in recent decades a playwright of West End/Broadway hits, is pitch perfect in leavening the generally base townsfolk and bleak milieu with jokes that deepen character; the municipal meat inspector [Bill Paterson], whose raids are met with cries of ""Gestapo"" and lacks the senses of taste and smell, and as Liz Smith witnesses the contraband pig defecating all over her kitchen floor, she cringes, and shouts to Dame Maggie Smith, ""I was quite right not to want kiddies if this is what it's like.""

Veteran BBC director Malcolm Mowbray, who conceived the story with Alan Bennett, staged the action with just the right undertow of nastiness, and drew consistently neat performances from the ensemble, including Liz Smith as Joyce Chilverses's perpetually dotty live-in mother, and Pete Postlethwaite as a Machiavellian butcher who ruthlessly has his competitors shut down, and Richard Griffiths as a candy-munching accountant who, like Palin's Gilbert, gets sweet on the pig. A Private Function amply demonstrated by a Dame Maggie Smith crawling after the porker, butcher knife in hand, or earnestly wailing for upper-class respect (""My father owned a chain of dry cleaners!""), punctures respectability with lowdown buffoonery and high style.

Blu-ray Video Quality  There have been better transfers of catalogue titles released onto Blu-ray, even of films older than A Private Functions 1984 vintage, but the 1080p encoding still looks acceptably film-like. Despite the appearance of slight source damage throughout and soft details, the transfer is pleasing enough and absent major amounts of compression artefacts and video noise. Despite this, the colours are bright and sharp, the blacks are rich, and there are no artefacts to be seen.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is a basic Uncompressed 2.0 LPCM Stereo mix. Theres not much to say about it other than it provides clear enough dialogue, although it sometimes sounds a bit too compressed. The balance of sound effects and dialogue has a decent amount of space and especially the midrange is punchy.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: None, except the theatrical trailers for A Private Function and close to a dozen other features by HandMade Films, the company co-founded by ex-Beatle George Harrison, including Time Bandits, Mona Lisa and Withnail & I. They hearken back to a time when the British film industry outside of the Harry Potter franchise actually existed.

Finally, A Private Function is the kind of film that recalls the twee Ealing comedies of the '50s and yet another example of the disparities among the myriad types of funny characters of the period. If you're a right fan of this particular brand of British wit, dive in. If your tastes run more toward the raucous, though, politely decline the invite to this Private Function and it is one of the wittiest films of the 1980s, and on top of all that it is in my mind a true Alan Bennett classic comedy caper, that we the British can only pull off and has always been a big favourite of mine, but I find it very strange that this was not released in the UK, despite this anomaly, I am glad it has been released on the Blu-ray format and has been added to a pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!
