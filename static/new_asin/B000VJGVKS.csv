2942341,4,B000VJGVKS,"I own several of the millcreek products but this is the best of them so far.  Most of the movies I have seen (no I have not seen them all yet, 250 movies takes quite a bit of television watching time.) have been actually excellent.  I did not expect perfect copies of any of these films when I bought this set, so I have no gripes there.  However, there are a few movies on this set (like other millscreek products) that I will never watch, even though in some cases I have it four or five times on other Millscreek boxset products.

So if you are interested in buying just one of their DVD sets this may be the right one for you.",1238630400,2,630,4.097560975609756
2942342,4,B000VJGVKS,"The films in this box are mostly public domain, and the quality can be variable, but at the price per film it really isn't worth seeking them out and burning them yourself.  And there are some really good films in here; British Intelligence, starring Boris Karloff, for instance, or the wonderful Escape from Sobibor.  Others are more B-movie fodder, but still fascinating and enjoyable, like The Black Raven with George Zucco, or Suddenly, starring Frank Sinatra - worth watching as curiosities if nothing else.  There is the occasional piece of dross in there, but I can honestly say this was well worth the money.",1229731200,2,616,4.903846153846154

2942344,5,B000VJGVKS,"First, what this isn't. It is not a collection of Casablanca-esqe blockbusters. The movies in this boxset were average fare for the respective time periods. In addition, not minute was spent on restoration. What it is, though, is a hell of a deal. 250 movies for less than 50 bucks--that is 19.9 cents each!

Old movies, like old radio shows and even old music, are frequently an acquired taste. But if you put in the effort and acquire the taste, you have a feast waiting for you.

Nothing fancy in the packaging, but nonetheless it is efficient and attractive. One other bonus is Millcreek's web site. There is synopsis and basic credits for each movie. While not as deep as IMDB, Millcreek's site is easy and very useful.

For me, this is an amazing deal. Thanks Millcreek!!!!",1205884800,31,779,4.671532846715328
2942345,4,B000VJGVKS,"MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT's mega-movie packs are always a bargain, and a great way to instantly build or add depth to a video library. Their boxed double-sided DVDs are individually housed in gloss-coated heavy paper sleeves that take up a minimum of space, yet provide excellent protection for the discs. This compactness of design makes possible the storage of literally thousands of films on a single book shelf.

The MYSTERY COLLECTION 250 MOVIE PACK offers an enormous sampling of public domain suspense, noir, action and who-dun-it films. At 325 hours this is the longest running DVD box set ever issued. All the big stars of yesteryear are here: Cagney, Welles, Barrymore, Stanwyck, Lugosi, Sinatra, McQueen, Davis, Rooney, Karloff, Brynner, Lamarr, Raft, Widmark, Lorre, Rathbone, Burr, Lombard and dozens more. Many of these are 'B' grade Hollywood product of the 1930s - '50s. There's also a good selection of more recent titles and actors. No matter which era you prefer though, this 250 movie pack is sure to entertain for many months.

FOR A COMPLETE LIST AND DETAILS OF ALL MOVIES, CHECK COMMENT #1 ON THIS REVIEW (see below)",1195344000,53,4067,7.901315789473684
8219043,5,B000VJGVKS,great,1405555200,,5,5.0
8219044,1,B000VJGVKS,"Cannot write a review of this as it was a gift for someone who likes Mystery movies - for me, I would not watch it. The recipient of the movie pack, a real Mystery movie enthusiast, unfortunately was run over by a car before I was able to give it to him as a gift. I could not get a refund on what I paid. Unfortunately.",1386547200,,320,3.8636363636363638
8219045,5,B000VJGVKS,"Mill Creek does it again with it's 250 Mystery Movie Collection. I paid only 89.99 for this and it was well worth the price. Once again like the 250 Horror Movie Collection, each movie on this collection is about the price of a cheap cup of coffee. And for that price you get such great stars as Basil Rathbone, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr and many others. We also get exciting and suspenseful tales of some of the most popular and beloved characters like, Sherlock Holmes, Dick Tracey and even The Shadow. In this 250 movie pack we get gangsters, beautiful dames, intrepid reporters and hard-boiled gumshoe detectives. So, once again, sit back and enjoy hours of suspense, mystery and action from an inexpensive pack of great movies of long ago. Again these aren't HD BLU RAY updated movies but the movies of our parents and grandparents day so don't set your expectations too high and you'll spend hours and hours in film noir bliss.",1324425600,,934,4.666666666666667
8219046,5,B000VJGVKS,"I bought this used in March for under $40. This is one of the best buys I've ever made. It has everything from Sherlock Holmes and Dick Tracy to minor Noir gems like ""Kansas City Confidential"" and ""He Walks by Night,"" and even a couple of decent Tarzan films. The price seems to have gone up, but I don't think it is being produced anymore. Get it while you can.",1281484800,,362,4.185714285714286
8219047,4,B000VJGVKS,"It is hard to really ""rate"" the Mystery collection 250 movie pack.

I ordered it from Germany and due to reasons i didn't understand Amazon would not ship it to germany, only in ""used"" condition. I put ""used"" in quotation marks here as it was shrink wrapped, labeled as ""used"" but obviously never touched.

So i effectively got 250 movies for around 45 bucks plus shipping. Even shipping was a steal if you regard how heavy this thing is, you'd think a DVD weights close to nothing, but as this pack contains 60 of them, each ina seperate sleeves it is by far the heaviest DVD box i ever got. The outer box is nicely designed with a big Sherlock Holmes and some Gangsters which pretty much describes the direction this is going. The big plus on the outer box is that it lists all 250 (I didn't wanna count but i think it's rather even more, like 260ish) movies, the big minus is that it doesn't tell you on which of the 60 discs the movie is. The sleeves of the 60 double sided DVDs (You have to take the DVD out of your drive and turn over to watch the movies on the other sides in case you never had double sided DVDs before) list each side of the dvd on each side of the sleeve, so you have to check both sides of the disc to see all movies listed that are on the disc. This doesn't sound much like an issue but if you search a specific movie it doesnt make searching easier. the discs are sorted halfway alphabetical, but due to space optimization reasons its not fully alphabetical, for example DVD 1 starts with ""B"", then comes some ""A"" movies and so on.

The 60 discs themselves come as a handy little cardboard ""treasure chest"" which seems to be the best space saving way to store away 60 discs. The sleeves themselves do not just list the title of the movie but also a short review, running time and color.

Color is actually one of the most annoying drawbacks in this collection - if you don't like Black & White movies then this collection is DEFINITELY not for you. I did not count but i estimate that like 95% of all movies are Black&White movies from the 20s to 50s making this rather the ""Classic B&W crime movie pack"" than the ""Mystery pack"".

So expect to have a ton of very old B&W movies, if you can stand these you will probably like many of them. Seriously - like 260 movies and i barely knew even ONE of these from the title. Most of these are obviously quite low budget productions, but i think in the 30s and 40s it was rather unpopular to spend a fortune on a movie, so you can't say they are all among the worst from the 30s and 40s, mainly ""average"" movies, if they were made today like this you'd label most as a ""B-Movie"", but they definitely aren't all B-Movies. There definitely also are some real classics in the chest, for example Boris Karloffs' ""Mr Wong, detective"". The range really spreads from ""So bad it's good"" to ""terrible"" up to ""excellent movie"" as you'd expect it for 250+ more or less random picks.

The quality is definitely an issue here - I think it's normal that when you compare some 1930s B&W movie to ""The Matrix"" that picture quality seems a bit ""sub par"", but it has to be mentioned that none (at least none i noticed yet) of the movies are ""Digitally remastered"", most are rather bad sound and picture quality, so don't expect newest HD visuals in this package.

Anotehr issue with these old movies is the running time - in 20s to 40s it was quite popular to just have a running time around 60 minutes which makes most of the good movies in the chest a bit too short for a fun movie evening, but the good news is that you can just show several of them, it's not like you don't have enough short movies when you buy this pack.

There are a few colour movies in this pack and the ones i have already watched were so poor like they added these to underline like ""See? Color movies suck!"".

After all i would say if you are a 30s/40s crime and drama fan then you will have a chest box, if you absolutely hate black and white movies then definitely: Hands off. Anyways, however you think about it - for 45 bucks per 250 movies it was still a steal. But again - unless you are a B&W lover you should rather consider getting other packs like the ""50 movies drive in classics pack"" which features mainly color movies.",1277251200,2,4264,4.273853779429988
8219048,2,B000VJGVKS,"This huge collection of public domain, mostly b&w films, is a mixed bag. Worthy  movies like Detour, Impact, The Stranger,and others found here, are included in countless other collections by different packagers. But this is the biggest of them all. While it may seem like a great bargain at less than a dollar a disk, more than a few of the movies are not watchable because of poor, noisy  sound and fuzzy images. Mill Creek did not seek out the best prints to dump onto DVD. Also, not all the films in the collection are classic ""oldies.""  Several are obscure dogs from the 1970s and later. Finally, locating a film in the collection to watch is a pain. Mills Creek did not include an index identifying the location of each film on the 60 disc. You have to thumb through the all the discs and read the contents on both sides of the paper sleeves to locate your movie.",1255219200,10,869,4.452830188679245
8219049,3,B000VJGVKS,"Although the quality of the films, picture quality, and sound quality are quite variable,  this is still a worthwhile box.  I would definitely recommend it at Amazon's probably temporary ""sale"" price, but not at the normal price.
Additionally, as I read in another review, a disc was missing, while an adjacent one was duplicated.  I've notified Mill Creeks support; we will see if they remedy the problem.  It certainly isn't worth returning the set for one missing disc, as another sample could have the same problem(or more than one missing).",1248652800,3,545,5.022222222222222
8219050,5,B000VJGVKS,"enjoy some really great old movies.

While I will admit I am a great fan of these Mill Creek sets and have all 4 of the 250 collections (Horror, Family, Westerns & Mystery) along with several of the 50 movie packs this set is by far my favorite of the group. The price is right and pretty much across the board the movies are fun to watch; though there are a few stinkers in the bunch and the quality though not the best always only adds to the ambiance of these great old movies. Top off 250 old mystery movies with great packaging and you have many memorable evenings of good old fashioned fun family entertainment.

I you are a video snob and only want completely digitally remastered movies then keep looking because that is not what you are going to get with this or any of the sets Mill Creek has to offer.",1245715200,7,812,4.266233766233766
