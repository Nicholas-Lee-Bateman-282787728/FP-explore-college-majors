8269753,3,B0018H0WP2,"I originally watched this drama on mysoju.com some years ago, and it was great.  The subtitles were very good.  I liked it so much that I had to buy both seasons.  This seemed like a great set.

The story, as most people agree, is really good.  The subtitles on this set are not so good, and as another reviewer said, on the last episode, they're terrible.  They don't even use the correct names.  Since the last episode is one of the best, that really bothers me.

I've read that the separate seasons on dvd have better subtitles, so I'm going to re-buy the 2nd season.  I hope it will have the subtitles that I originally saw online.

Oh, by the way, I don't think mysoju.com works anymore, or the site is just completely changed, because I can no longer watch Hana Yori Dango on there.  And none of the other places that supposedly have it online work very well either.  Bummer.  The drama itself is excellent.  Just needs better subtitles.",1386806400,,943,4.470588235294118
8269754,5,B0018H0WP2,I loved watching this series and felt it was cast really well. After seeing this I looked up the actors who played Rui Hanazawa and Tsukasa Domyoji to see what else they have been in. I also saw the movie based on the series.,1371686400,,225,4.136363636363637
8269755,5,B0018H0WP2,I have to say this is my favorite Japanese Series. Even though its old i would still recommend this to everybody. Because once you watch this you will be hooked on this and want to keep on watching it even if your sleepy you won't want to sleep till this is officially over. I have watched this like 12 times already. 11 times by myself and 1 time with my mom. The actors are so fine the actress is pretty to. Their acting is good. The movie is awesome. I mean what else do you want more from this. watch this for real. you'll be glad that you did.,1340236800,,548,4.036697247706422

8269757,5,B0018H0WP2,"Hana Yori Dango is a very amazing J-Drama and the characters are portrayed so beautifully that I can't help but have a soft spot for all of them.  The storyline, while somewhat predictable, makes up for its predictability by the stunning acting of ALL the actors!

However, consumers be warned: While the storyline is beautiful and I HIGHLY recommend this show to everyone who enjoys a little happy cry now and again, the English subtitles are TERRIBLE.  I don't know if each one is DVD is made differently, or if the specific one I got was one of a kind, but literally every other word was misspelled or botched.  Sometimes I couldn't even identify what the words meant, even after putting them in the context of the sentence.  If that doesn't bother you, GREAT!  If it does, I'd pay special attention to how the subs are made and WHO makes them.",1264291200,,847,4.576158940397351

It has been over 5 weeks since I ordered this movie and I have not received it or had a reply to my email that was forworded through Amazon.",1231286400,,196,4.157894736842105
8269760,4,B0018H0WP2,"This is the first time I've watched a live-action Japanese drama, being an amime fan, and I was bowled away by how well done this was. This show was recommended to me by a friend of mine, so I thought I would try something new, and I'm glad I did.  I laughed, I cried (I can't believe I cried), and I became completely enthralled by the story.  I love this series!

I can't vouch for the accuracy of the subtitles since I know absolutely no Japanese.  However, as the previous reviewer pointed out, the last episode does have *horrible* English subtitles.  It's a little campy too.  Ah well, nothing is perfect. :) The last episode was not enough to ruin the series for me.  I enjoyed every minute of it - all of it.",1220486400,,716,4.298507462686567
8269761,3,B0018H0WP2,"As stated, the show is fantastic, blending highschool and social-class satire, serious minded emotionality, with the streak of light absurdism (Tsukushi's LADY BOSS), etc. Its also edited and shot quite well. And if you're learning Japanese, nothing is better than watching TV and Film to saturate in the 'common tongue' of the people.

The transfer for these DVD's is not fantastic, but certainly not unacceptable. I'd give the image quality of season 1 an 85%, deducting for a minor blur/pixilation, and pixilated subtitles. Image quality of season two is 98%.

The accuracy of the subtitles is generally decent in season 1, especially if you've seen the chinese version of the dvd, which constantly uses incorrect words and grammar. Season 2 is a challenge. Episode 1 has  CONSTANT misspellings. The rest of the episodes are fine, in fact I'd say they're great...that is until you get to the final episode. The subtitles in the final special are AWFUL. They are atrociously translated sentence fragments that barely make sense and use COMPLETELY wrong names, names that aren't even names...or Japanese for that matter!!! It killed me because the subtitles ruined the emotional heights and tensions in that episode...well, almost. The spirit of the show was able to shine through, but I was pretty pissed.

All in all its a question of necessity vs. economy. Do you need to own this show on DVD? If so, and you don't feel like forking out between $50-$75 PER SEASON on any other site (if they even have a 'region free' version), then I suggest getting this. When I weigh the cost against flaws, i think I still came out on top. Until an top quality US release of HANADAN occurs, I'll stick with this.",1219622400,6,1702,4.8788927335640135
