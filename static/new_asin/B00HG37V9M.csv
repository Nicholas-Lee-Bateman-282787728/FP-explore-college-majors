8632623,3,B00HG37V9M,"This 1964 classic also known as ""Monstrosity"" starts out with ""out of tune"" horny or brassy type music. And the music keeps up until the end. There is some dialog but mostly it is a Bradford Dillman narration. On the plus side they show the pictures of the people with names attached so you get to know the actors. Bradford has made TV appearances well into the 1990's.
------------
Mr. Hetty March (Marjorie Eaton) a rich uggy old lady has plenty of money. With the help of a rogue scientist, Dr. Otto frank (Frank Grestle) kept on retainer, she intends to have her brain (through the miracle of modern 1964 atomics), transferred into a young body. The body is to be selected from three candidates. Which one will it be? Anita from Spain, Nina from Austria, or Bea from England?
What does her aged companion think of this? Will the scientist be able to gain something from this? And do you thing the three donors suspect what awaits them?

Do not get distracted by the naked female bodies with strategically placed metal straps.",1524355200,,1029,4.622950819672131
8632624,5,B00HG37V9M,"Incredible painstaking restoration of an unfairly neglected classic low-budget horror/sci-fi monster schlocker!  Looks like it was shot yesterday -- sharp, clear, and rock-steady.  The soundtrack has also been restored and sounds perfect with no noticeable hiss or distortion.  The before-and-after restoration demos are included on the disc and are astounding; they really show how much work went into this excellent presentation.  Buy with confidence, MonsterKids!",1523145600,,466,6.123076923076923
8632625,5,B00HG37V9M,"My review specifically pertains to the 2017 restoration performed by ""Moth.""  This is actually a DVD-R, not a DVD.  That said, this is an excellent restoration from the original negative that presents the film in far better visual condition than it has previously appeared on ""PD"" discs.  Those who love out-of-whack brain transfer horrors, such as THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE and THE HEAD, will find plenty of cheapjack entertainment value here.

The restoration disc has an array of supplements, such as an audio commentary track with bemused genre historian Tom Weaver, an on-camera interview with original narrator Bradford Dillman, an alternate opening credit sequence that sports a different title, and other ephemera such as a stills gallery and a trailer preview.

There may also be a Blu-ray (actually, a BD-R) version available on Amazon in the near future, which will have the same features.",1504742400,5,902,5.1931034482758625
