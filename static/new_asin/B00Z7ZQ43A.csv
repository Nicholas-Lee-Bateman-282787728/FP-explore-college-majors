8750812,5,B00Z7ZQ43A,"Despite the negative review from Kotaku, this stage play was actually really well done!  This also strangely has really good English subtitles for both the main feature and the extras. Below are some pointers I have for this stage play:

-The actress who played Aigis the the Persona 3 stage plays was perfect, so the actress for Aigis in this one pales in comparison. She doesn't emulate the mannerisms and poses at all like the actress from the P3 plays.
-The actors for Mitsuru and Akihiko return from the P3 stage plays. The rest of the actors are new.
-The actors for Elizabeth and Kanji are perfect!
-If you're familiar with the Persona 4 Arena story, it was largely a visual novel with sparse animation cutscenes and mostly static pictures. This is the first time we see the P4A story through movement!

Having seen the other Persona stage plays, this one beats the Persona 4 stage plays, but rests just under the Persona 3 stage plays in terms of enjoyability and quality.",1451174400,3,980,4.686046511627907
