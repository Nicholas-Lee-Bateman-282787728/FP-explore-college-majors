Tape jerked at the beginning of the tape but leveled out once it started playing. It does have a few streaks in the tape, but for the most part this tape is in good condition.",1359936000,,307,3.967741935483871
7866899,5,6304266405,"Undoubtedly the best of all Mats Helge films, and what a masterpiece! The lighting is far better than in any other swedish film I can think of, and technically speaking it's flawless in every possible way; a real feast for  the eye and great fun for that matter. A must see! .... Come back,  Mats Helge; the world needs you!",969408000,,324,4.383333333333334
7866900,1,6304266405,"The best swedish ninja film ever, but that doesn't say much. An extremely boring film. The directing and cinematography is ok, but the screenplay is  stupid. Did you knew that ninjas have poisoned arrows that makes the head  or heart explode when the victim gets the poison in his blood? But this  film is a cult classic here in Sweden, so many watch this cause it's so bad  it's good. Well, watch this on your own risk... you have been warned.",967939200,3,444,4.444444444444445
7866901,2,6304266405,"I've seen worse ninja movies before; but even they had more attention to martial arts than this flick does.  There seems to be a preoccupation with watching military soldiers being mowed down by gun fire than anything  ""ninja"" at all.  Its more like watching a swat team in action.  I'd give a lot more to see a ninja against another ninja which is why I'd  stay clear of this flick and bet my money on ""Revenge of the  Ninja"" or ""Enter the Ninja"" as they are some of the greats  in this genre.",961372800,2,494,4.247311827956989
