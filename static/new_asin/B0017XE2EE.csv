8267696,4,B0017XE2EE,Arrived quickly and it was a better video than expected! Great workout and fairly simple to follow!,1437436800,,99,4.882352941176471
8267697,2,B0017XE2EE,This is by far the most difficult step workouts I have ever tried and I am not a beginning stepper. This routine will take a few times to get the steps down right. Her cueing is hard to hear too.,1368057600,,195,3.9
8267698,5,B0017XE2EE,"This is one of my favorite step workouts that I have been happily doing, maybe once a week, for several months.  I do Workout #1, since Workout #2 is a ittle too dance-y for my abilities.  This workout really gets my heart pumping, and it has enough variety that I do not get tired of it.  It also leaves me time to do at least one other favorite routine from another DVD (yoga stretches, arms, abs, etc.) for a balanced early morning workout.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is at least intermediate level.",1334016000,2,518,4.364583333333333
8267699,5,B0017XE2EE,"Now this is the intensity and energy I expect from an advanced step workout!  I consider this to be Tracey Staehle's best step workout, even though it was her second one and she's done several since.

This DVD has two 30 minute step workouts. The first workout has 5 combos that have less complex choreography and include a few aerobic intervals.  The second workout consists of six more complex routines, with a seventh routine that includes the prior six.

What I really enjoyed about this DVD:

**Section 1 routine is fun and intense, but wasn't high impact.  I used two risers on each side for added intensity.

**Tracey is relaxed and enjoying herself in these workouts.  She wasn't ""yelling"" the instructions like she tends to do in most of her other workouts.

**the TIFT(take it from the top) teaching style in Section 1.  I like learning a combo, then repeating it with the next combo.  This is how I like to learn routines, not by endlessly breaking down the moves.

**Section 2 had fun choreography that wasn't super complex.  I liked that Tracey didn't spend much time breaking down the moves.

**good production quality.  Greg Twombly produced this DVD and he really knows his stuff.  After this series, Tracey tried other production companies with pretty bad results, in my opinion. She should have stayed with Greg.

**music had a good beat and the routines stayed on the beat.  I mention this because Tracey's subsequent DVDs, especially her kickboxing ones, are off-beat.

There were a few issues with this workout:

**The description for Section 1 is inaccurate.  It states that: ""there are five step combos and five intervals.""  Yes, there are five step combos, but there are only 3 intervals.

**In Section 1, the fifth combo ends abruptly and you go straight to the cool down.  I guess they wanted to keep the workout to 30 minutes so they cut out some of the intervals.

These issues didn't detract from the workout.

I recommend this DVD for those wanting some fun step routines.  I recommend this step DVD over any other of Tracey's step workouts.",1278979200,4,2071,4.77683615819209
