8060232,5,B0009G0GZY,"I have the first 6 videos in the series and have had time to watch each several times. Each of the 6 gives unique information to you, the student, so that you don't feel like your reviewing a lot of material just because you own others in a series. The instructor (Sifu) Chung Kwok Chow makes each lesson interesting and delivers the core message of each lesson effectively so that th student can appreciate the progression through the set. I wouls recommend getting DVDs numbers 1,2 and 4 together or numbers 2, 3 and 4 together if you decide to buy as may as 3. If you just want a feel of Wing Chun and will just want one DVD then get #3 or #4.",1304553600,2,646,4.176
