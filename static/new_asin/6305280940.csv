Wrong- this is definitely not for family viewing. You may wonder  what naked ladies have to do with the themes of Beatles songs.  I did  too.
And you will still be wondering after seeing the DVD.  Save your  money unless it turns your crank to catch glimpses of the chests of various  Barbie wannabes squirming around in front of a soft focus lens.
Okay,  so I wasn't counting on the nekid ladies.  But I was counting on ""Songs by  the Beatles, Neil Sedaka, Elvis, Frank Sinatra and more"".  Well, I struck  out again. Unlike other DVDs which honestly point out that the recordings  are not by the original singers, this description may lead you to believe  that you will get what I think most Karaoke customers want:  a high quality  video with music by the original performers which can have one or all of  the vocals muted.  Not on this DVD- all are impersonators.  Some are not  too bad though.  I don't think Amazon is to blame- they probably just  copied some misleading promotional description from the vendor.
As for  the DVD features, the basic karaoke options are there.  You can selectively  mute out the vocals using track 2.  The third track puts music on the left  channel and vocals on the right.  Unfortunately, the music tracks provide  only a background rhythm without any melody line, so there are no cuing  clues to aid the singers in knowing when to sing the next line.  Lastly, I  could not figure out how to switch to other tracks such as music only using  my DVD player.  I could do it fine playing it on the computer.
Tracks:  ""Beattles""- Let it Be, Hey Jude, Michelle, Ticket to Ride, Yesterday, In my  Life, Twist and Shout, Long and Winding Road ""Sedaka""- Breaking up is hard  to do, Calendar Girl,  ""Presley""- Don't be cruel ""Sinatra""-  and now  for the ""More!"" section: ""Humperdink!""- Release me
""Avalon (you know,  Frankie)""- Venus",952128000,22,2022,4.580281690140845
