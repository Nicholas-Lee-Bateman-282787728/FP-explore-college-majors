7825563,4,6302420261,"Koko the Clown was created by Max Fleischer in 1919, by using his rotoscoping device and brother Dave dressed in a clown suit (Rotoscope allowed animators to make drawings from photographs or film). The character was called ""the clown"" until 1923, when Dick Huemer reworked his appearance and named him Ko-Ko The hyphen was dropped in 1927 after Fleischer affiliated with Paramount Studios. Fleischer's first famous animation was retired and brought back frequently over the decades, the last time being 1960, when 100 color shorts were produced for TV with Larry Storch as Koko's voice.

The ten silent shorts presented on MAX FLEISCHER'S KOKO THE CLOWN were all directed by Dave Fleischer.
Includes pipe organ soundtrack.

7825564,3,6302420261,"I would have liked to have seen this collection with at least a musical score or a little more information on the history of these fine cartoons. As it is, it's an interesting artifact of historical importance to animation buffs, but only really enjoyable when enjoyed in small doses. Maybe I'll try listening to this stuff with some fast techno-dance music playing at about 240 beats per minute, instead of instrumental organ background, which is what you'd expect. Pick your own background - and be warned: this tape is SILENT!",999043200,10,529,4.888888888888889
7825565,4,6302420261,"Max Fleischer's ""Out of the Inkwell"" (later changed to ""Inkwell Imps"") cartoons are overlooked classics of early  animation. These were some of the earliest cartoons to mix live-action with  animation, thus paving the way for later live-action\animation films like  ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". This tape contains 10 of the later  ""Inkwell Imps"" cartoons from the late 1920s, which ingeniously  combine the live-action and animation. For example, in ""Koko's  Courtship"" (1927), Koko's dog Fritz follows an errand boy to make sure  he doesn't waste time on his way to deliver a drawing of Koko. The scene  cuts back and forth between the errand boy walking and Fritz following.  In ""Koko's Hot Ink"" (1928), Koko and Fritz swim in a live-action  swimming pool.
Out of over 100 Inkwell cartoons that were made between  1919 and 1929, only 23 of them are available on various videos, which is a  sorry fate for this overlooked masterpiece.",967075200,12,933,5.065789473684211
