In the fall of 1874 there was a rush for wealth from selling buffalo hides. White men invaded Indian territory to slaughter the buffalo herds of the Red Man. The story begins at a busy small town, many wagons are on the street. Hides sell for $2 (a lot of money when men worked all day for $1). Two men in a stagecoach are on the road. One mans wagon overturned, he was chased by hide thieves, white men disguised as Indians. We see the Jett camp and its people. A wagon arrives with a broken wheel; the wheel is burned with the Indian clothing. Tom rides to see Millie, bird whistles are used as a signal. Tom chooses marriage over the outfit. The Jett gang leaves in the night, taking Millie with them. Tom arrives, but he is beaten and tied to his horse. He returns to his friends and is rescued.

Tom spots a buffalo herd. They begin the slaughter, then stake out the hides so they won't curl up. Salt is used as a preservative. There is a hunting party of Comanches. They will kill a few buffalo for meat. The buffalo are hunted and shot. [But none falls.] The Jett gang chases a lone wagon carrying buffalo hides. The tribal chiefs band together against the White Men who are destroying the buffalo. The White Men are warned against Indian trouble and told to leave the country. They are warned against hide thieves and the snow. Men of the Jett gang want to leave with half the buffalo hides, but they are stopped. Millie rides away, her wagon falls apart, she is in danger from the thundering herd. The wagons form a circle to withstand an attack from Indians. A messenger is sent to Lone Bend to get help from the townsmen. Will they arrive in time? Will there be a happy ending for Tom and Millie?

This provides a reason for the Indian War of 1876. The Indians wanted to protect their natural resources against theft by the White Man. The history book that I read said the US government provoked the war as an excuse to remove Indians and allow the Black Hills gold rush and clear a path for a transcontinental railroad to the Pacific northwest. This was like a forerunner to urban development and eminent domain actions that continue today in big cities. This was adapted from the Zane Grey novel The Thundering Herd, which was the former title of this movie.",1463356800,,2300,4.432624113475177
