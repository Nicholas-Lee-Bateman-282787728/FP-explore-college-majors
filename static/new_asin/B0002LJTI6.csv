8028991,1,B0002LJTI6,"The damned are those that waste their hard-earned cash on this silly mess of latex monsters and screaming idiots.  The dialogue sounds like it was written by a sixth-grader.  Ten minutes  into this film ,I think, why am I watching this?  I could  clean the toilet.  This movie is as appealing as a 90 year old stripper in a g-string.  I like horror movies, but in this case, the movie is the horror.",1399075200,,399,4.383561643835616
8028992,4,B0002LJTI6,"Based on the setting alone the movie already gets more than 1 star. How could a horror movie go wrong with an Insane Asylum filled with Criminally Insane patients? Add a creepy soul-sucking demon and you have a hit! Sure the acting may leave a little to be desired but it's a horror movie! Overall, this is a good movie for people who enjoy horror flicks and can relax and enjoy it for what it is.",1291939200,2,397,4.2368421052631575
8028993,4,B0002LJTI6,"Based on the not-so-good reviews on here, I didn't have much expectation for this movie to be great.  It may not be the best movie in the world but I actually enjoyed it.  The evil monster thing looks really cool.  In fact it looks alot like the front cover but more realistic.  It's not extremely gory or scary but it's still worth a view to me.",1270080000,2,346,4.196969696969697
8028994,1,B0002LJTI6,"This movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue wasn't too stiff... but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a Doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a Doctor - and it just goes south from there.

On top of that, the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the Godzilla-looking thing in Curse of the Demon. There's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of Logan's Run.

In the end, the cinematography couldn't save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story just doesn't go anywhere. I think ""Hellbored"" would have been a better title for this.",1119744000,2,798,4.692857142857143
8028995,3,B0002LJTI6,"When it comes right down to it, there's nothing much more creepy than an old mental hospital and Asylum of the Damned does a wonderful job of providing a set with a real sense of horror and forboding, but once you get past that you have a film with a rather weak plot and weaker performances and a stupid looking monster to boot.

Matt Stasi is James Bishop, a resident psychologist who begins a new job at the St. Andrews mental hospital.  He soon learns that residents are being killed and learns of some evil creature called ""The harvester"" who steals their souls for the devil.  James tries to uncover the evil but then has to deal with his idiotic girlfriend showing up to make matters that much worse.

The creatures is stupid looking and looks like one of those old Paul Blaisdell creature designs from the 1950's.  Cheap and not scary in the least.  The fact that the film co-stars Tracy Scoggins and Tiny Lister should tell you everything you need to know about the acting performances...especially when Tiny Lister is the best actor...

A movie that looks good and had good atmosphere but done in by bad acting and weak plot.",1109548800,5,1135,4.561576354679803
8028996,3,B0002LJTI6,"ASYLUM OF THE DAMNED is an okay horror flick, having some intense sequences and featuring a nice heroic performance from Matt Stasi.  Stasi plays a young psychiatric intern who does his residency at St. Andrew's Asylum.  From the opening scene, we know all is not quite right at this institution.  A doctor screams into the camera that he is not insane and is soon dispatched by a ferocious looking demon.  Anyway, Stasi wants to make a difference in the world and he is rather appalled at the manner in which the hospital's director (the infamously frightening Bruce Payne) runs the place.  No cures here.  Just containment.  Stasi soon finds that many patients have died from apparent heart attacks, but with the help of a giant orderly (Tommy Tiny Lister) and a crusty patient who manages to escape every once in a while, Stasi stumbles onto something quite more frightening than he could have ever imagined.

Tracy Scoggins (so lovely on DYNASTY) plays a mousy looking and malicious nurse.  The movie has some good production values even though it sort of falls apart plotwise by the end.  But Stasi keeps you interested, as does the villainous Payne.",1109030400,2,1155,4.846938775510204
