7847675,5,6303446949,"I first saw this movie when I rented Apollo 13. I didn't think that it would be a very good movie, but it turns out that it is a very good film and that it is worth the 90 mins. and the two tapes. It follows the doomed mission that ran into an accident 250,000 miles away from home. It also follows the rest of NASA's other achivments such as Apollo 11 and its other disaters such as the Challenger. If you have seen Apollo 13 I highly recommend that you rent or purchase this video.",977443200,,483,4.041666666666667
