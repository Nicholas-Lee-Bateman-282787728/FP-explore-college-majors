8083863,1,B000B9EYA2,"Comedy is supposed to be culturally-specific.  They say successful American comedies often flop abroad.  So maybe I wasn't appreciating this as a foreign comedy.  This work was predictable with bad acting and bad actors.  At one point the couple buys a car and the car is sitting in their living room!!!!  In the US, it's college students, not newlyweds, who are unwise with credit cards.  This is a terribly weak film, but perhaps those familiar with Latin American cinema would appreciate it somehow.  This is no ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or ""Dona Herlinda and her Son.""  This was just some mess.  You've been warned!",1191283200,,620,4.884615384615385
