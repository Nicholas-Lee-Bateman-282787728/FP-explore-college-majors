8249320,5,B00136MBKW,"I watched this video, years ago. It's is seriously a groundbreaking documentary on the origins of religion. Jordan Maxwell draws heavy on the writings of Gerald Massey. The infomation delievered in this video leads to one conculsion. All popular or major religions dervied from Ancient Africa. Basically Pharoah Akhenaton discovered that all religions were basically one and the same. This video, was like a cold glass of water in the hot desert. Once you get to the bottom of the glass, nothing could stop me from searching for that next glass. I assure you once you watch this video,you will have a different out look on life",1326931200,3,627,4.869158878504673
