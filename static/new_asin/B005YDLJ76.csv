One Star For Her Singing Ability
And One For Her Abilty To Perform So Amazing Even Though She Was Pregenet
But Overall I feel that this was too similar to her Las Vegas Concert with saying the same things with her life to cutting her songs in half during her time with destiny's child but other than that I really enjoyed it",1397088000,,348,4.208955223880597

4905522,4,B005YDLJ76,I have never been to a concert. I was looking for a compilation of Beyonc number one's in DVD format. This DVD is the best I could find.

4905523,3,B005YDLJ76,"I bought this disc just to see Beyonce sing and perform but I think I am well out of her age group.
I found her as beautiful and as sweet as a long bar of chocolate but unfortunately her music is not to my taste.
The music is for those who like it loud and the words were unintelligible.
I had to go back to my Frank Sinatra and Joni James era discs.

Beyonce is a A1 performer no doubt and she just performed in Auckland to capacity crowd.
NZ loved her and she loved NZ.
I would probably feel the same were I 50 years younger.

4905564,3,B005YDLJ76,"The concert itself wasn't as great as I had hoped, and was pretty brief for what I expected, but it was still worth watching. I probably would not have purchased the DVD had I watched the concert beforehand.

The DVD packaging is annoying, because there's not a sleeve or anything you can ""snap"" to prevent the DVDs from falling out. Hard to transport, or just keep in place for that matter.",1370476800,,391,4.507042253521127
4905565,5,B005YDLJ76,"Live at Roseland more than met my expectations, Beyonce does concert dvds frequently and they're always huge and ambitious. Roseland feels intimate, it feels smaller and therefore more emotional, and Beyonce taking you through the phases of her career and life (with the later knowledge that she was pregnant and the time of filming) makes it even more special.

But for real, the rendition of 1+1 on top of the piano alone makes this DVD worth it.",1363737600,,448,4.818181818181818

Great entertainment :D especially considering that she was pregnant.",1337212800,,351,4.333333333333333

4905578,5,B005YDLJ76,I thought I would get something with her hollering but It was totally different.  This DVD was awesome.  The first disc was clear and the sound amazing.  It was beautiful and the video DVD I had not seen any of the videos.  It was totally worth buying and I got it delivered fast.,1333324800,,280,4.226415094339623

4905583,3,B005YDLJ76,"I love Beyonce and the first live version of her I watched was the I Am Tour. I LOVED that one. I guess because I saw that one first I was expecting more. Honestly to me on the 4 dvd there wasn't enough dancing for me. Most of the time she was holding her belly and singing, not doing much dancing. LOL. It was cute but I wanted to see more dancing but I understand she was pregnant. The singing was good but I just wanted more. The I AM Tour dvd spoiled me. I was also expecting to see more Les Twins on stage too. (For those of you who don't know they are stellar dancers with the air-fros from France that she found out about on You Tube ""Les Twins World of Dance in San Diego""). Yeah Larry and Laurent are sexy and just give her show that ""umpph"" on stage. I was disappointed she didn't show much footage of them because I love those boys. Anyways overall I would say if you watched the I Am tour you may be slightly disappointed. For those of you who haven't seen her live at all or the I AM tour you will love it! I love Bey but this just wasn't as good as her last dvd.",1330992000,,1076,3.9403669724770642
4905604,5,B005YDLJ76,This dvd is excellent. I love how it captures her talent. The quality of this video is great. I must have watched it about 5 times in the last 2 days.,1330646400,,150,3.870967741935484
4905605,5,B005YDLJ76,I absolutely love this item.  Beyonce' is the best there is so I knew I would love it no matter what.  She gives her all and I know that her other fans appreciate it as much as I do.  I love Beyonce',1330300800,,199,3.6904761904761907
4905606,1,B005YDLJ76,"Beyonce is great as always, but this DVD contains blocks that she performed long time ago and the concert is interrupted by different shots from backstage.

Well, I will not comment the show or song selection too much. Her voice and performance are simply great. But the disc was a bit of disappointment for me. It started with the review of her beginnings. The very same story as on her previous DVD from Las Vegas. The same thing about how she started singing when she was 5 and the same story about her father sending producers home because Beyonce was not ready at that time.

Then, the concert is interrupted by strange cuts from backstage. Not sure what that should mean. Why in the middle of a song ?!?!? That belongs to bonus tracks !!! How can one replace half of a song with rehearsal from changing room?",1329696000,9,814,4.493243243243243
4905607,1,B005YDLJ76,"I am one of the biggest Beyonce fans for sure! However this was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY! It's basically the Vegas intimate concert DVD with 4-5 new songs from the 4 album. No wardrobe changes or anything like that. Same skit, going through the MJ song, Destivy Childs etc etc. If you have the Vegas one (which I would def buy over this one if you don't have it) I would not buy this. Save your $! I read other reviews saying the same thing and thought they were just haters but they weren't! They were right. Def waste of money! I would even send it back but between the cost of shipping to and from it's not worth it to even send it back.",1327017600,9,636,4.055555555555555
4905608,5,B005YDLJ76,I watched this last night and was pleasantly surprised. Beyonce worked it! Because I really didn't care for her I Am Yours Tour DVD. But this one I loved because they showed the personal side of Beyonce. This is up there with her Beyonce Experince DVD.  I would recommend this DVD.,1326672000,,281,4.509803921568627
4905609,2,B005YDLJ76,"During the behind the scenes concert footage, Beyonce said this isn't about the choreography or the costumes, it's about the music. I don't like to be negative, but this is where the show falls short.

At first glance, it seems Beyonce is going to sing lots of songs. Technically, the Destiny's Child and her older solo hits are sung as listed in the first half. Here's the catch. Most of them lasted between 20 seconds to a minute, with lots of chit chat and video footage intertwined in between. Oh and she got the audience to sing Irreplaceable while she did not do a note of it. Maybe, she did not want to exert herself due to her pregnancy or it was simply a great way to conserve energy. Anyway, the first half with that long set list ends in just 30 minutes.

The second half features tracks from 4. It was a real contrast to the first. Songs are performed in full. The real Beyonce kicks in full throttle, with all that mane tossing, body jiggling and rapid legwork. (This is evident in the first half too but the songs are way too short). Again, there are lots of video footage. Strangely, one of them occupied only a tiny slice of the TV screen, leaving large black borders in between. Did the camera crew do a banged up job, so that they have to use all those unnecessary fillers?

Ironically, clothes horse Beyonce only wore one outfit for the whole show while the DVD booklet is filled with photos of her playing Barbie doll, wearing many different dresses, tresses etc. I, for one wouldn't fault her if she wore them onstage! Fashion shows work for me too, Beyonce Honey!

The show ends after a breezy 75 minutes. On the whole, it was way too short. If I had paid for tickets, I would be very disappointed. I don't think Beyonce is out to shortchange her audience but people could get the wrong idea.

I don't understand why this is called a deluxe edition. Content wise, it does not feel deluxe. A more appropriate marketing term would be extra features. Disc one is the concert and a very brief documentary. Disc two contains seven videos from 4 and a 19 minute behind the scenes. Couldn't Sony put all these into one disc? It felt like they stretched the skimpy contents out on two. Perhaps, Beyonce will go double platinum faster.

Yes, Beyonce is talented, sexy and beautiful and the second half was way better. But I would hesitate to recommend 4. Save your moolah for her other DVDs instead.",1326585600,2,2412,4.482915717539863
4905610,5,B005YDLJ76,"The dvd of Beyonce: Live At Roseland Elements of 4 shows a concert full of engaging performances.  In addition both dvds have bonus performances.  Beyonce projects forth intense energy for the selected musical tracks.  She starts the event out with cleverly weaving the origins of her musical career into the various songs. My two favorite parts of this concert were tied into the renditions of ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Love On Top"".  The scene that also pulled at my heartstrings was where she was shown hugging a young fan during ""Irreplaceable"".  He is one of her biggest fans and appeared to be younger than 13.  Things became even more sentimental and touching when Beyonce gently suggested that he sing ""Irreplaceable"".  I have to say that this scene made me like her even more because it was obvious that he (the young fan) felt uplifted by her encouragement. What also makes the purchase worth it is that the second dvd contains six great music videos.  It is a tie between the music videos that I enjoyed the most: ""Love On Top"" and ""Dance For You.""  Beyonce: Live At Roseland: Elements of 4 is best for anyone that enjoyed any of her music videos and/or songs from the ""4"" collection.",1326499200,,1190,4.6826923076923075

4905635,5,B005YDLJ76,"I bought the DVD at Wal Mart without really having any expectations. To be honest, I only bought it because it was cheap ha ha ha and I love watching concert DVD's. I watched the DVD and I was blown away! Her All Girl band is off the chain, Beyonce's voice is out of this world and her dancing is straight up outrageous and unreal. Oh, but what's even more impressive is that she was 5 months PREGNANT!! I have a new found love for Beyonce! My only complaint would be the super cheesey script she had at the beginning of the DVD but other than that it was excellent.

Best Performances in my opinion:
1. Love On Top
2. End Of time
3. Who run the world
4. I care
5. Crazy in love",1326067200,2,678,4.022222222222222

She's the only artist out that can actually both SING AND DANCE as well as she does so why wouldn't you want this DVD??? You have other Beyonce DVDs why this one? For one this is the only time you'll probably see ""4"" (which is honestly vocally and it's in entirety her best album)performed in FULL (@ least for awhile) and this is also probably the only time you'll see Beyonce in such an intimate setting. Another reason is you get to see ALOT OF NEVER BEFORE SEEN PERSONAL FOOTAGE. Vocally ""I care"" is the best performance and editing wise ""Countdown"" is pretty cool! So go ahead and add this one to your collection you will not be disappointed =)",1325548800,2,784,4.413793103448276

4905642,5,B005YDLJ76,"This dvd was definitely a hitter as are all her dvd's. My favorite performances were ""Run The World"", ""Rather Die Young"", and ""End of Time"". Beyonce is such a dynamic performer and everything she does, she puts more heart and soul in it. She is one of few artists who allows her fans to journey with her through her most memorable experiences and I, as a fan, appreciate that.
For some reason, I feel Beyonce was exceptionally emotional on this dvd as she is seen wiping tears on a few songs and just judging from past dvd performances, something was definitely on her mind. Just hope all was well because if not, she still knocked it out.
The only thing I would hope changes from here on out is the whole Destiny Child segment. I understand that those songs are apart of her story and are very dear to her but she has enough of her own songs to do a full blown out concert and it would still sell.

So overall, I love this dvd and I keep it in rotation as I do the ""I Am...Yours"" dvd. Just can't help but love the best performer of our time!!!",1325376000,2,1044,4.22

This is the first Beyonce DVD I've purchased, so I didn't mind the ""life story"" parts. The constant mentions of ""#1"" this or that are rather self-indulgent and rather pointless. However, it really doesn't matter because Beyonce blows it out of the park. Her voice is top form and she sounds like a million bucks on every song. She just gets better and better with age. She looks fabulous and the direction is well-done. I enjoyed the editing on 'Countdown' but was glad that it wasn't overdone on other songs. The dancing and female band make a great addition to Beyonce's powerful voice. Turn this up!!",1325203200,,709,4.725806451612903

She does alot of Destiny Child songs and the songs that she does perform from her past 3 albums, are too brief.  I would like it, at least at this point in her career, for her to stick to her solo albums. She has always been a great performer and she is in this concert, but the format and songs choosen don't leave much of an impression. Most of Beyonce's concert DVD's are awesome, but this one I would skip.",1325203200,3,573,4.238532110091743

Plus it's Beyonce! she does Arena's, not small intimate venues. I know! I know! I'm horrible and deserve to burn in hell but you will see what I mean when you get it :). Okay, let's focus ... I'm a huge Destiny's Child Fan and Beyonce Fan; have all of their concert DVD's and have seen them in concert in my hometown (Atlanta) so I was really looking forward to this. To be honest, I did not care for the story telling by Beyonce about her Journey leading to '4' only because I have heard it so many times, I could tell it myself. I also must say that I honestly don't see Beyonce as an intimate venue artist. She is more of a huge arena kinda girl so I had to scale down my beyonce mania down a notch. I will say this: Her voice is powerful, and her band is amazing; she does her best to keep up with her dancers and you can tell that unlike other concert DVD's; she is truly humbled and grateful to be performing at Roseland. I loved the fact that she is very honest and open about her life, her relationship with Jay etc. There are also glimpses into her life throughout the concert, which can be a little distracting because I kept pausing to see who she was partying with privately (insert a pregnant Alicia Keys and Kanye West Here ..amongst others).

I just watched it yesterday for the first time with my mom and 2 yr. old niece and we loved it!  I love her for many reasons...not only is she a fellow Houstonian, but she has a drive, humbleness and creative mind that is very, very rare.  It is definitely something that inspires me and I know that she inspires so many that she touches.  It was amazing to see my niece watch her move in her videos, she was in awe.  After each video ended and we stopped dancing she would say ""It's gone off, play it again Ni-Ni!"".  Thanks again Amazon for great customer service!",1324944000,,983,4.158730158730159

4905681,1,B005YDLJ76,"Granted that Beyonce is a great entertainer with a gift for singing songs with incendiary rhythms and beats. Clearly, her voice is in fine form with its new gospel-inspired stylings. But this video does not do anything to inform the viewer about the film's subject, Beyonce.  It feels very over-polished, slick, and completely forgettable.

It's too heavy on material from her DC period, and the story-telling aspect of the show wears on the viewer after a while cuz you never get hear full versions of the songs. The video clips interspersed between performances does nothing to create the sense of intimacy with the entertainer as most concert footage should do.

In the end, the viewer is left feeling unsatisfied and wonderding if the purchase of this DVD was worth the money. It isn't. Watch one of her other performance DVDs if you want to experience her live performances without braving the elements, astronomical parking fees, and suffocating/overexuberant crowds.",1324771200,6,973,5.1455696202531644

4905686,5,B005YDLJ76,"Beyonc is looking fabulous on the '4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc', which happened early in 2011. Her vocals are amazing as always and the video editing from 'Live at Roseland' DVD is incredible!
The beginning of the concert shows the path Beyonc followed until now (as in 'I Am... Yours') and later on she performs almost every song from her latest album '4' (except for 'Start Over' and the tracks from Deluxe Version). It's really nice to watch, specially these songs: the ballads are amazingly performed with intimacy and the uptempos feature an amazing set of lights to complete the well-known Beyonc coreography style.
The only thing I would change is to add an angle option to see the concert from Roseland only (some songs show some personal videos and/or footage from other concerts). Not that I didn't like to see these clips, but it would be nice to see how it happened in NYC only.
About the deluxe package, I found it really nice! As I don't actually like digipack, this one is really beautiful!!! The cover is kind of shiny, like a Blu-Ray glove and the CDs are packed in a good-looking plastic. There is also a booklet, featuring some pictures from '4' photoshoot and others as well.

Beyonce and them vocals are always on point, she did not turn me away from being a STAN or what ever you call us die hard Beyonce fans.

4905691,4,B005YDLJ76,"I'll get the basics out of the way now; this is a short concert, as all of the pre-4 songs are shortened [the Destiny's Child era tracks get the most severe cuts - the backing singers and audience do the majority of the singing]. As the concert is short, there are no costume changes and no fancy stage setups, and although there is dancing, there wasn't much space to perform and Beyonce was already pregnant, so there is less then is usual at a Beyonce concert.

It wasn't a problem for me, but some people may not like, is that various footage of Beyonce is inserted throughout the songs. Again, this wasn't an issue for me, but if you want to simply sit back and watch Beyonce sing, this isn't the best DVD to get.

***

This Beyonce performing live, so yeah, I'll call this a must own, but I'll admit that I had a few niggles, so it isn't perfect for me:

The run of concerts at Roseland was to celebrate the 4 album, so it was disappointing to find that Beyonce only sings four non-singles from the 4 album; I Care, I Miss You, Rather Die Young and I Was Here [End Of Time is going to be a single]. I love I Care and I Miss You, but would have adored to see her perform Start Over live.

I do really like the single Party, but it doesn't have the same spark to it without the Andre 3000/J Cole rap in it.

As I already mentioned, this is a short concert and the earlier songs all get shortened considerably.

***

Now for the highlights;

I never really liked 1 + 1 and I Was Here before now, but her live performances have sold me.

I Care and I Miss You are two of my favourite songs on the 4 album and her vocals on the live versions are out of this world.

I think that the music videos made for her 4 singles are her best and they're all [except End Of Time - maybe it's not been filmed yet?] on the second disc. All the way from the epic choreography in Run The World (Girls), to the just-been-released Dance For You - which is jaw droppingly smoking and has left me rethinking my heterosexuality...",1322784000,15,2011,4.157216494845361

Most of the show is devoted to Destiny's Child's music.  Beyonce has enough music of her own to finally stop performing the songs of her former group.  I think it's tacky.  On top of that, there is a little too much video footage being thrown in while the focus should be on what's happening on the stage.  I hope Beyonce has her child, takes a few years and returns with a BRAND NEW act/show leaving Destiny's Child melodies and the same things she's been doing for years now.",1322524800,14,629,4.426086956521739

4905698,5,B005YDLJ76,"Similar to the I Am...Yours concert from Las Vegas, Beyonce peformed songs from her latest album 4 at the Roseland ballroom in New York City (for a more intimate peformance). The diva definitely knows how to work the crowd and the ballroom while being backed by an all female band, orchestra, and dancers. I bought the Wal-Mart edition (which only came with the DVD of the concert) so I am solely basing my review off of the performance.
The setlist:
Beyonce performed all of her old Destiny's Child hits and songs from her solo projects (all of the performances were shortened because the main focus of the show were the songs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4/dp/B0050CQY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4</a>). The DVD was intertwined with clips from her childhood, previous performances, and never before seen footage (similar to the I Am...Tour DVD). After she performed her previous hits, she went on to perform the songs from 4 (except Start Over).

4905701,4,B005YDLJ76,"I viewed the standard concert-only edition offered at Wal-mart and on-line for a limited time the beginning of the week before receiving the Deluxe in the mail from Amazon, and overall I must say it's nice for the price no matter which version you buy.  The cinematography was excellent and you get the feel of the venue and the intamacy everyone behind the production was intentionally trying to create.  Her voice was top notch where it counted, but to see her not necessarily at her best and vulnerable vocally especially given her pregnancy (which you will see support early reports back when the show started after watching this) was to be admired because she knocked that show out with style, grace, and glamour like only she could.  She just can do no wrong.  Period.

Off the top as the show begins to progress, you notice that it is being set up like the Vegas ""I Am...Yours"" one week stand back two years ago with the dialogue and script.  Thank God it changes when she begins to do the songs from ""4.""  Technically, like another reviewer mentioned, the editing and special effects on some of the songs like ""Countdown"" and the fact that various clips from her career and personal movies were mixed in with the songs can be a little jarring, but hey...she's clearly not going to tour in 2011 and who knows what 2012 holds, so this is your best bet.  I myself was one of the lucky fans who snapped tickets up to this show when they went on sale and waited outside in the cold rain for 3-plus hours before the doors opened almost 2 hours after the intended start on the tickets, so for me it did hold a bit of sentimental value attending the first night and having to wait for this once in a life time opportunity.  The DVD producers clearly wanted to play on that.  However, it's quite clear that the DVD presentation is a culmination of all 4 nights as the stars such as Betsey Johnson and Lady Gaga didn't come until subsequent nights, some noticeable wardrobe issues, and the fact that the night I was there the young guy didn't give her the painting he made of her.  And though she performed the songs in order save for ""Start Over,"" they are out of order here which I don't quite understand but it is what it is.  I would've preferred them in order since the album builds track after track emotionally, and to see her sing it in that order, you really get the true power of ""4.""

As for the features on this Deluxe Edition, on Disc One ""Roseland: Behind the Scenes"" serves more like a 7-minute trailer than really an in-depth look into the show.  Alot of the footage was featured at the show as teasers on the screens before it began.  Disc Two's ""Beyonce: Behind the Camera"" is a little more what the Disc One featurette lacks as it appears like a documentary chronicling the behind the scenes of the album and videos.  Much better piece and highlights Beyonce's newfound passion as producer and director.  The packaging is similar to digi-pack and includes a book of glossy photos and writings.

If you're a fan of Beyonce like I am or didn't get to attend this show back in August, this is a must.",1322006400,29,3114,4.48141592920354
4905702,4,B005YDLJ76,"I really don't understand what's with Beyonce and her concert DVDs lately. She keeps over editing them, and I'm not addressing the clips spliced in between but I'm addressing the music. Why edit down music like this? Why is a show that took 1hr and 30 mins chopped down to 1hr and 18 which includes 5 minutes of credits.

I think she did amazing. She is the best performer of the generation. The video is obviously taken from multiple shots because one of her tassels on her dress is broken off in some parts and not in others.

Also! the set list was reorganized for the 4 songs. I kind of skipped through the First part because honestly, its exactly like the I am yours live from the Wynn DVD.

A major problem for me is the band! I HATE BEYONCE's NEW DRUMMER!! She's nowhere near as good as the other drummers. The drums sound stale and lack bass. ALSO, the sound quality is terrible. I can barely hear the bass guitar in a song like End of Time which is bass prominent.

Overall I wouldn't suggest buying this DVD. Actually you should wait to buy the Deluxe Edition whenever it comes out because it features behind the scenes and videos.",1321833600,7,1141,4.393364928909953
