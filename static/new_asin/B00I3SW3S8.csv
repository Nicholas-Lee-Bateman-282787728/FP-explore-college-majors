6248498,5,B00I3SW3S8,"Bloodmarsh Krackoon written and directed by Bronx native Jerry Landi is a must-see (and a must buy) for horror buffs, aficionados, and fans alike.

It's like a fine wine - it just keeps getting better as the plot moves along.  It's one of those movies that has it all - blood, gore, suspense, action, comedy, and scantily clad women, however, what sets it apart from other films within its genre is the message ""no one dumps on the Bronx, and lives"".  C'mon think about it.....

In a nutshell it's about a crack-addicted raccoon and her offspring terrorizing a Bronx community better known as ""Locust Point"" which, relatively speaking, is a ""sleepy little town"". The protagonist Mayor Peter Rabbit (played by Sal Amore) is put through a myriad of challenges while trying to piece together the series of murders reigning down on his community.  The cast of characters is a slew of crude and colorful people ranging from those working on the inside for the Mayor to the many antagonists he encounters along the way.  And let's not forget the true  ""stars"" of the film - the robotic raccoons who provide a ton of laughs, thrills, and additional eye candy.

This movie is an all-around winner - it's campy, gritty, bloody, highly entertaining and down right hilarious!",1397779200,,1264,4.819444444444445

8638860,1,B00I3SW3S8,"The item was sent on time and packaged well, so I have not complaints there..
The movie itself isn't worthy paying 2 cents for.  Some ""horror"" movies are corny, but this movie was just plain stupid.  I could get past the ridiculous stuff animal ""krackoons"", but the story line wasn't there and the acting was the pits.  I read through some of the reviews before I even bought the movie and it was a mixed bag of reviews, but in reality someone should have said ""don't waste your time or money"".",1435968000,2,494,4.406593406593407
8638861,1,B00I3SW3S8,"People who have read my reviews for any length of time know that I adore grade-Z cinematic cheese as much as anyone. So when I found a movie about a one-eyed, crack-addicted raccoon terrorizing the Bronx, I thought I had hit bad movie paydirt. Opening with the obligatory toxic waste being consumed by green raccoon puppets, we quickly are thrust into a drama involving a politician named Peter Rabbit (Sal Amore,) and the least likeable cast in recent memory pursuing a trio of krackoons for the duration of the running time. The production values would make Ed Wood blush, and the acting is so bad it's just plain...well...bad.

When the best scene in the movie involves a green one-eyed raccoon puppet interrupting a man doing his business on the toilet, I think I have revealed all you need to know about this film.",1428019200,6,819,4.7272727272727275
8638862,1,B00I3SW3S8,"Yet another movie where all the 5 star reviews must be from the people who worked on the film.  I don't even know where to begin with this...  Acting was not too bad in parts which is really the only positive thing I can say.  And even that is really stretching it.  The movie is completely full of holes.  There is a ""bonus"" movie also included which is really just the dissected parts of the main movie!  May have been better if they just put them both together.  At least then, most of the movie would make more sense.

Now let's talk about the so called Krackoon.  Well, it was basically a green teddy bear that someone wiggled towards the camera.  I think they may have glued a plastic eyeball onto it for added affect.  Didn't work...  Completely ridiculous.  Then it grows up to be a guy in a very bad body suit with, not really sure what, for the head.  Not even one of those ""so bad, it's good"" type of movies.  A complete waste of time and money...

Please read and believe the other 1 star reviews and do not fall for the 5 star.",1412812800,,1040,4.2030456852791875

8638865,1,B00I3SW3S8,"I can only assume that the other reviewers are on the payroll or I'm not privy to the joke. This is a steaming pile of garbage that, like the films main story, should be dumped. Imagine one of those terrible 80's horror movies shot on Betamax, It's not as good as that :(",1402099200,4,271,4.132075471698113
8638866,4,B00I3SW3S8,"If your looking for a fun film, BLOODMARSH KRACKOON is for you. I picked up a copy at The Chiller Expo in April and was happy I did. The great part about the film is that it pokes fun at itself while spilling a decent amount of blood. I also like The Bronx feel.",1401840000,,262,3.8703703703703702
8638867,5,B00I3SW3S8,"I was lucky enough to catch Bloodmarsh Krackoon at an NYC film festival last year and i absolutely loved it. the acting is great, the story is gritty, and i thought the cinematography stood out. An entirely Bronx based production, we may look back years from now and see this film as a watershed moment in NY indie film making. Plenty of films and TV shows are shot in manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens but The Bronx is hardly represented in our recent film landscape. I look forward to see what Jerry, Marty, and John come up with next. Do yourself a favor and preorder now!!",1400112000,2,574,4.476190476190476
