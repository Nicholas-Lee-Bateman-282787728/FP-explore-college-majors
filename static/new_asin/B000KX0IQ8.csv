The one compliment that I have is that it's diverse.  The actors are white, Asian, and Black.  Too often in martial arts films, only men are present; this film had women and children too.

Maybe I had a defective copy.  Usually when I put a DVD in the player, the menu comes up immediately.  Nothing happened here and I had to actively hit the play button.  There seemed to be no menu; there was no way to select scenes.  Usually York Entertainment ""films"" include Spanish subtitles, but this work lacked them.",1172102400,,642,4.552631578947368
