5572357,5,B00BC1UPRO,"This horrifying true story about world war 2 china is a very gut wrenching and sad movie. Three million people are starved to death or killed in combat in henan province china in 1942. We follow two families as they try to escape to another province. The realistic bombing scenes are very horrible as people and animals are blown to bits by the merciless Japanese. The whole movie is like one long horror that never ends, and it's a true horror. The Japanese were responsible for 30 million deaths duruing the war, and many were in China. The acting here is superb and the lead actor loses everything and everyone and that is conveyed with a incredible performance from him. Tim Robbins and Adrian brody have small roles in this one and both are excellent as you would expect.  The story does jump back to Chang kai sheck as he tries to fight the war and deal with the famine. Corruptoin only makes it worse in the HEnan province for everyone including him. I think we can never understand how bad things can really be on this planet, but the lead character does when he tells his dead wife ""in your next life don't come back here' and who could blame him. After watching this movie , one can only be thankful never to have gone through a famine. Although if the carbon levels continue to climb the people of even future America will experience mass famine and crop failure , at least they won't have to be in the middle of a World war though!.  I think this flick deserved a best foreign picture Oscar. It that well done and acted. Watch it with your kids when they start complaining about how bad their lives are. They will then learn the truth for sure, that as one starving woman says as she steals food after her husband is murdered 'I lost my husband and a man is worth two crackers at least'.  the blu ray looks excellent and it's in widescreen as it was shown. This movie is in Chinese and English. IT's mostly Chinese so they you have to read the English subtitles which is fine.",1372291200,15,1988,4.396739130434782
5572358,3,B00BC1UPRO,"The film I thought on the whole was ok but not as good as it had the potential to be a great film.
It felt a little disjointed and muddled in parts but this could be down to bad editing. the special effects I thought were paticularly good and so realistic the film showed suffering in war time and gave you a first hand look at desperation and suffering in war time so it did the job it set out to do in this respect as always adrien brody
performed well ; tim robbins accent hard to tell where he was supposed to be from so little less convincing acting
here as an award winner he's definitely capable of doing better. Did the film hit home with the right message ? Definitely yes but but because of being in chinese and subtitles made it miss out on potential wider audience and perhaps lost out on recoginition for potential awards. Its a story that was told well
but lost out in editing and direction but well done to cast and crew for pulling off what looked like and epic task",1371945600,2,982,4.201058201058201
5572359,4,B00BC1UPRO,"Blue Ray DVD was delivered quickly and in perfect 'as advertised' condition. A review of the film will be forthcoming. I expect it to be much the same type of quality film as 'My Way', 'The Flowers of War' and 'The Long Way Back', which are also of the epic style genre that is thankfully finding its way back from cultural oscurity. It is nice to see a renewed popularity of films that provide a rich experience rather than mindless car chases cookie-cutter plots.",1370908800,,465,4.5476190476190474
5572360,5,B00BC1UPRO,"Bought this as a recommended movie because I'm primarily a WWII and history buff.  I must say, I was stunned at how truly EPIC this movie is.  The cinematography is absolutely spectacular - some of the best work I've ever seen from a foreign film and it rivals anything I've ever seen from any movie for that matter.  Unlike most foreign movies, this one doesn't have that ""Gee, I'm watching a foreign movie"" feel to it.

If you do not like reading subtitles, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.  THIS IS A MOVIE YOU MUST READ, UNLESS YOU SPEAK CHINESE.  It is 2-1/2 hours long, so watching it and reading it at the same time is challenging at times and I did pause the disc and go back a few times just to catch everything - there are many scenes where incredible scenes are unfolding but you're busy reading the text so you can't fully appreciate what's going on.  I personally don't mind doing that, but if it bothers you, then that's something to consider.

The story is just what people have said, so I'll not rehash that - it is a horrifying and tragic chapter of WWII history that has been completely glossed over and forgotten, but perhaps thanks to this remarkable film, it will get some long overdue attention.  The roles played by Adrien and Tim Robins are bit parts, so their contribution to the movie is minimal, which is also great for me, personally, because I don't particularly care for either of them.  Anybody could've played their parts and the movie would've been just as good - the Chinese characters carry this film and they are OUTSTANDING.

The CG work on the aerial attack scenes is slightly sub-par compared to most modern movies and has a bit of a video game look to it, but I've seen much worse - and that is the only thing I can even halfway criticize this film for.  They had a cast of thousands for this movie, used actual locations instead of doing a ton of CG work, the explosions are real (and there are a lot of them), the wounds are gruesome and realistic to the point of being just as disturbing (if not more so) as what you see in Saving Private Ryan.

I cannot recommend this movie highly enough - it is a REMARKABLE achievement in every possible respect.  The story line is incredible, and even better, it apparently is largely true because it is based on interviews with a Chinese girl who lived through the experience, which was conducted by an American reporter who was there first-hand in 1942 and witnessed it himself.  If I understand it correctly, this collaboration of their record of events was published in 1964, and that work serves as the story line for this movie - thus the name, ""Back to 1942"" - it was a return to a horrifying time in their lives for both the reporter and the woman he was interviewing.

If you're a WWII history fanatic, this is an essential movie you MUST have in your collection.  They NAILED all the details of the Chinese and Japanese weapons, uniforms, vehicles, and everything else throughout the movie - incredible attention to detail.  If you're just a fan of truly sweeping huge scale movies, this one will also impress you - why this movie didn't win numerous awards is beyond me.  Whomever is responsible for paying attention to amazing foreign movies wasn't paying attention here.

BUY THIS ONE - it is the ""Ben Hur"" of Chinese suffering and chaos during WWII.",1370476800,62,3338,4.531666666666666
5572361,4,B00BC1UPRO,"I like books and movies that can make me feel the story being portrayed.  This movie sure did that for me.  The suffering that these people experienced was awful. But their selfless understanding and love for each other made me feel good and hopeful about humanity.  In the midst of all that misery many of them were able to put their own needs aside and give of themselves to others.  I would like to recommend a similar story - ""Behind the Beautiful Forevers"" by Katherine Boo

5572372,3,B00BC1UPRO,"This is an historical-biographical movie about events in China early in 1942 and was made by and for, and will be of actual interest to, or understood solely by the Chinese people.  It is not concerned with issues of right and wrong or recrimination against the Japanese.  The famine described was a natural disaster unrelated to the war!  Be aware that Chinese attitudes and social patterns then and now are not according to US mores with regard to opportunism, venality and selfishness.

Most of the 2 hour movie concerns the migration of starving inhabitants of Henan province (South of Peking) and focuses on a particular family. At the fade-out, the father, having lost all of his family, meets an infant girl whose mother has just died. The two decide to declare themselves a new family. The epilog reveals that the events are biographical.

To refresh your memory, the year 1942 includes the Japan-China war (then in its 5th year), the war in Europe (3rd year), and the beginning of the USA-Japan war. Historical characters depicted are Chiang Kai Shek, Madame Chiang, US General Stillwell, and writer Theodore White. The Chinese government had already retreated to Chunking (south of Henan). The key event of the time was the entry of the Japanese army into Henan.

The last half hour is concerned with governmental and international affairs taking place in Chunking in relative peace. The main issue is the attempt of Theodore White, through emissaries, to get Chiang Kai Shek to send food supplies to relieve Henan. This attempt is countered by the Chinese reluctance to be bearers of bad news!  Thus (as it appears) Chiang Kai Shek was actually unaware of the extent of the suffering. When Chiang finally realized the severity of the situation he made an attempt to provide some relief, but about 1/10 of what was needed.

In justification it is reasonable to think that Chiang wanted to burden the Japanese with the famine. Chiang also knew that the US had entered the war and believed the Japanese would elect for status quo.

At the same time ominous news arrived that Roosevelt and Churchill were meeting with Stalin and he, Chiang, had not been invited. The obvious conclusion was that America's entry into the war would benefit Stalin not Chiang!

As it turned out American support ended in August 1945. Chiang recognized that postwar turmoil and social problems, and Russian backing of Mao, would work against his reuniting China. After preparing a retreat to Taiwan with the remainder of his army, Chiang left for Taiwan in December 1949.

Theodore White was there as a student of Chinese language and culture and went on to be a biographer for a number of prominent Americans. Henry Luce (not mentioned), born in China and an influential publisher, hired White to write for Time magazine. Chiang died in August 1975. Mao Tse Tung, not mentioned, died in September 1976. The interested viewer should consult pre-1945 newspapers available at many libraries.",1439078400,3,2975,4.953815261044177

5572376,5,B00BC1UPRO,"During the Sino- Japanese war that formed part of World War II, but had started way earlier, the country was in turmoil. The Nationalists led by Chan Kai-Shek were trying to defend China from the aggressive war that had been waged on them by Imperial Japan. The Communists were still a fledgling army but were doing their bit - this is not included in the film. However in Henan province there was a prolonged drought that had led to a famine. The population were eventually left with no choice but to flee.

The story is based around the inhabitants of one town and a landlord -Fan- who leads his family west away from the invaders. Along the way they are beset with grief in many forms, from the Japanese, the Chinese Army (Kuomintang) and eventually other refugees. Along side this we have the efforts of a lone Time magazine reporter Theodore White (Adrien Brody) to try to bring their plight to the wider World.

This is an epic film in all its forms, the cast is one of thousands, the scope and scale of the story is staggering and there is action, greed, drama, love, and heartbreak. This is a film of 140 minutes but it just flies by.  It is also not over sentimental and I feel has more of an impact because of it. There is some CGI of the planes but it is all limited to where it is most effective. This is a masterful attempt to tell a forgotten part of history and to show another side to war and I have to say I was completely taken with it - a film for World cinema fans everywhere.",1427760000,4,1496,4.297872340425532

I am Chinese and it made me very sad to see the Chinese government have so little regard for their own people.  I cannot begin to really imagine what these people had to face, seeing their loved ones slowly dying of starvation, leaving all that you loved just to find food.

For a long time the wealthy and the government oppressed and exploited others of their own and it is very sad to know this.  And there were even things regarding people resorted to cannibalism in order to just stay alive.  It is not like they wanted to.

As humans, we should regard every life as valuable, but this film showed how some were so cruel and indifferent.  But, the compassion of one American journalist was good and he did help bring about help to some of the people who were left or survived.

Sometimes people in government positions think they are so high and mighty and it extends to all governments of every nation and they can lose touch with the reality of most people they are governing.  Very good, but horrifyingly sad movie.",1396915200,6,1102,4.47
5572393,4,B00BC1UPRO,"An epic of suffering in a rural Chinese province afflicted with a multitude of disasters both natural and man-made. There are sequences of bombing and strafing runs by Japanese planes on combined civilian and military columns that for realism and immediacy easily rival any number of recent films about World War II, including Saving Private Ryan. The Nationalists and their Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek are shown alternately withholding or cynically and selectively bestowing (never enough) aid for masses of starving refugees. When Adrien Brody, who plays the American journalist Theodore White, tells Chiang that there have been reports of cannibalism among the refugees, the response is that ""no Chinese would ever do that."" The Chinese, of course, went on to do just that during Mao's induced famines, which were on a scale that eclipsed the death toll from the drought in Henan. The multiple producer /executive producer credits suggests that the staggering scale of Back to 1942 is the beneficiary of all the new money in China. But surely it could not have been made without the go ahead and resources of her present Communist rulers. Along with showing how (Nationalist) Chinese officials at the highest levels played politics with millions of lives, the film clearly and, at moments, crudely, is appealing to small ""n"" nationalist and anti-Japanese sentiment.",1393977600,2,1370,5.260273972602739

The religionists are pathetically helpless and powerless. The Chinese Nationalists must make dispassionate, cold decisions to preserve the instrumentality of government and country over the people themselves. The Japanese have no stake in the lives of the Chinese people and treat them as fodder.

An American journalist appears from time to time, meandering absurdly and selflishly through the bleeding spine of the film, commenting on profundities from his view point---always with his camera pointed at the faces of desperation and violent death. Supposedly an icon fro art and courage, this is the one character I wanted to see dead, and eaten.

Famine, war, death, birth, and the infinite senselessness of it all: be prepared to dig into your own deepest caverns and psychologocal pits---where your worst fears are buried, and not very deeply.

How is this relevant? Why make an epic film about this, when it happened 71 years ago---before you were even born?

Because nothing changes. It has been this way since the beginning of so-called ""civilization."" This applies to you. That's why it's relevant. There is nothing new here; only the horror of reality, newly discovered.

Civilization---your civilization you inherited---it's the spawning ground for freedom-sucking cities, kings, governments, warlords, bankers, politicians, and other un-natural parasites leeched to the hip of Humanity

How relevant to you? Because: could---is---the same dim beast lurch, or is it lurching this way---here? Headed this way soon?

Or not?

In either possibility, there is No help coming. We are on our own.

 Each of us alone in this.

Even if you have the time to CONVINCE the already deeply impoverished Chinese majority of what will happen if they are found in their homes by the Japanese, it is still not effective in getting them to leave their homes and take their chances of dying on the road, miles from home and starving instead of the Hellraiser alternative that is their fate if they stay in situ.  The Japanese made sure that the Chinese died as slowly and painfully as possible.  No Xingxing treaured daughter, no newborn grandson, no peaceful demise for the elderly mother.  China's leaders understand the people well and it is not a hard decision to make the most effective choice to minimize the violence done to them by the Japanese waging an everlasting regretless war.

Throughout, the Japanese are depicted as being above (it all) and looking down upon the Chinese in their ZEROES.  The filmmakers resist the urge to mention that the Japanese would poison or drug the food relief offered to Chinese villagers and communicates the terror of being captured by the Japanese soldiers by having it result in EMPLOYMENT which is really about the stubborn Japanese ""investment"" in China today.  LOL.

You'll never see the Chinese good luck design of the red coloration on steamed bread the same way again.

This is ABSOLUTELY a response to the Japanese displeasure with the refugee scene in Joy Luck Club in the mildest possible way.  Once again, the Japanese get off lightly.

""Why Bring It Up Again?""

Why are they still coming?

If you know what they do to us when they can get away with it, you wouldn't mind any mischaracterization not even if it is a character assassination.  You'll wear the mislabel of HOOKER without fret.  Because you know every lie wielded by the Allies is a weapon.  THAT's the sledgehammer, the battleaxe if female, that comes down over and over again on the enemy.

In what they refuse when they are starving, should tell you how much this story is  a lie and wonder at what is meant by ""spicy.""  Neighboring Shandong cuisine is mild and fresh and the Japanese have claimed its recipes as their own.

Spicy  - ferocious, ruthless, harrowing, you decide.

One look at the map at Henan betwixt Shanxi and Shandong and you might know that we lost human treasure.  You have to be IN China to see Chinese faces in that region.  Zhang Ziyi might hint at it but the ordinary people with their quick faces of whimsy and poignancy such are the poor people of China.  They're not suppposed to be fed pieces of their children or neighbors by the Japanese Visitors.

""Coal trucks were sent out to collect women. Age didn't matter; girls as young as 11 and women as old as 80. Virgins were prized to affirm a warrior's virility. Twenty soldiers might rape a woman. Or, out of sadism, they might order a father on a daughter.""",1376179200,,4123,4.967930029154519

5572411,4,B00BC1UPRO,"Throughout history, many countries have suffered from famines.  Famines have destroyed cities, led to internal collapses of civilization, diseases/plagues and has led to unrest.

While one can read of great famines in Ireland, the United States, Ethiopia, India and Russia.  And for China, the country has suffered many centuries of famine, where millions upon millions have died.

But during World War II, because of Japanese occupation and politics, the famine that took place in Henan, China was downplayed and even to the point of not existing, until a Time magazine journalist named Theodore H. White, who was stationed in Chungking, China's wartime capital, was able to see and document the refugees (who were affected by the famine) and yet were being killed by the Japanese during bombing raids and turned back by their own government who did not have a solution to feed millions of people, nor to have millions stay in their city.

Unfortunately, the truth was censored by the Nationalist government of China at the time and even his editors rewrote his stories at Time Magazine.  So, Theodore White went on to write his account of what he saw in China along with Annalee Jacoby, in the book ""Thunder Out if China"".

For filmmaker Feng Xiaogang, it has been a challenge for him to get the novel of Zhenyu Liu, based on the famine in the Henan province to be made into a film.  After several attempts, in 2010, ""Back to 1942 would eventually receive a film adaptation.

Known for his films ""A World Without Thieves"", ""If You Are the One"", ""Cell Phone"", ""The Banquet"" and becoming one of China's most successful filmmakers.  ""Back to 1942 would eventually win the A.I.C. Award for ""Best cinematography"" and the ""Golden Butterfly Award"" during its premiere at the International Rome Film Festival and ""Best Film of Mainland and Taiwan"" at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards.

VIDEO:

""Back to 1942 is a film that was intentionally desaturated and given almost a greenish/brownish tinge at times.  While costume design and production design are top notch, and the cinematography by Yue Lu look wonderful, I think that the choice of colors of not being natural was a bit of a surprise.  Sometimes they were, sometimes they were cooler, sometimes they were warmer but for the most part, I assume this was Lu and filmmaker Feng Xiaogang's intention.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Back to 1942 is presented in Mandarin/English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Mandarin being the primary language spoken, while Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody's scenes are in English.  There is good use of surround usage during the more wartime scenes.  From the Japanese attacks on the refugees to the attacks on Chinese cities, there is good use of the surround channels and LFE during those scenes.  But the film is primarily dialogue driven and sometimes allows for use of crowd ambiance.

Subtitles are in English and Chinese.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Back to 1942 is a thought-provoking film and also a war film that many filmmakers have not even tried to pursue.

In the past few years, we have seen films that dealt with Japanese occupation and the atrocities that took place, especially in Nanjing or other areas of China such as the film ""City of Life and Death"" and ""The Children of Huang-Shi"" but having taken a Chinese history class and have watched countless historical documentaries of famine that have destroyed civilizations throughout our history, ""Back to 1942 was the first film that exposed me to the famine of Henan.

China is a country that has suffered from famine for centuries, while ""The Great Chinese Famine"" (1958-1961) were widely reported in the press, while journalist Theodore H. White tried his best to get the Chinese Nationalist government and his own bosses to report on the starving refugees, it was not widely reported and if anything, the government downplayed the death toll as seen in the film to around over a thousand people dying, while the truth is that 300 million may have died.  And unfortunately because it was downplayed, the exact figures were not ever recorded.

Why would this happen?

Journalist Theodore H. White garnered attention with what he wrote from his own personal first-person account, ""Famine and flood are China's sorrow. From time out of mind Chinese chroniclers have recorded these recurrent disasters with beating, persistent note of doom. Always in their chronicles Chinese historians have judged the great dynasties of the past by their ability to meet and master such tragic emergencies. In the concluding years of the war against Japan such a famine ravaged the north and tested the government of Chiang Kai-shek.""

Also, the government continued their trend of taxing the poor farmers who planted their grain, getting a large percentage of it and left very little for them to survive on.  To make things worse, those who must meet the grain quota had to sell their animals, land and property to raise money to buy the grain from others.

Chinese independent newspapers tried to get the word out of what was happening in Henan, but the government closed down the newspaper.

""Back to 1942 does show some of the horrors that White had written about.  People eating bark from trees and also leaves, dead people left on the side of the trail to be eaten by dogs.

You would think the government would respond, but White would write, "" The Chinese government failed to foresee the famine; when it came, it failed to act until too late. As early as October (1942), reports of the situation were arriving in Chungking. In November two government inspectors visited Honan, traveled the main motor roads, and returned to say the that the crisis was desperate and something must be done immediately. The Central Government dismissed the matter by appropriating $200,000,000 -paper money-for famine relief and sending a mandate to provincial authorities to remit taxes. The banks in Chungking loaded the bales of paper currency on trucks and sent a convoy bearing paper not food, to the stricken. It would have been hopeless to try to move heavy tonnage of grain from central China over the broken, mountainous communications to northern China and Honan. Yet just across the provincial border from Honan was the province of Shensi, whose grain stores were more than ample. A vigorous government would have ordered grain from Shensi into neighboring Honan immediately to avert disaster. But cracking down on Shensi in favor of Honan would have upset the delicate balance of power the government found so essential to its functioning. Grain might also have been moved to Honan from Hupeh, but the war commander in Hupeh (Hubei) would not permit it.""

Suffice to say, as the film is an adaptation of the novel by Liu Zhenyun, who also wrote the film, the one narration at the end of how he tried to interview his grandmother, a refugee who survived the ordeal, she rather not talk about it.  The fact is that millions of them were unfortunately betrayed by their own government.  By greed, by politics, be the lack of decision-making and unfortunately, the war had a lot to do with it as well.

While China has moved past their ties of Nationalism to Communism and the film does provide fodder for how a Nationalistic government betrayed their own people (and in ways, also showcases Chiang Kai Shek as a poor leader), unfortunately, the tale of ""Back to 1942 can be applied in so many countries that suffered from famine and even natural disasters.

Filmmaker Feng Xiaogang is known for capturing the human emotion and spirit through disaster but also capturing intense battle sequences which are featured in this film.  This latest film was his most intense yet and possibly the first major attempt to reach out to an international audience thanks to the casting of both Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody.  While Tim Robbins' scenes were probably not even needed in the film, Adrien Brody's role as Theodore H. White is important as his article is what gained international attention.

As for the Blu-ray release, the film does take an interesting visual style, especially when it comes down to color use (some may not like the saturated green/earth-tone tinge).  The film also has wonderful cinematography, costume and production design and for the most part, filmmaker Feng Xiaogang was able to create a thought-provoking, important film about the famine and the betrayal and the suffering of the Chinese refugees.  The lossless audio also utilizes the surround channels when needed but dialogue is crystal clear.  It is unfortunate that for a powerful film such as ""Back to 1942, not one special feature (but a theatrical trailer) was included on the Blu-ray release.  I'm absolutely surprised by that and it is a bit disappointing.

Overall, ""Back to 1942 is a powerful, thought-provoking film that opens your eyes to many factors of how millions of people in Henan, China suffered and possibly millions have died back in 1942 due to the great famine and also poor decision made by the government.  This is a film that showcases emotional suffering, death and enormous tragedy from an unfortunate time in China's history that many people in this world may not even know about and will probably never know about as this tragedy was kept secret and not documented by the government of that time.

It's a little lengthy, devoid of special features but yet, ""Back to 1942 is an epic film from filmmaker Feng Xiaogang that is recommended on Blu-ray!",1372896000,7,9575,4.940736119775421

8565666,5,B00BC1UPRO,"Generally the movies about WWII from the Chinese perspective have focused on Japan as the enemy and ignored the internal turmoil that China faced at the time.  These movies also tend to be more action and violence oriented, and not as political.  And they tend to always incorporate some big name white actor as the hero.  This movie also has the obligatory white guy in China that has a fairly big role in the movie.  I wish they'd stop doing that, but there's not much I can do about that.

As an anarchist, I'm keenly aware of the constant disconnect between the wealthy and the poor.  I'm aware of the very different experiences the wealthy have in wartime compared to how the poor experience wartime.  I especially liked this movie because it showed the economic aspect of the war, and because it showed the callousness of the Chinese Nationalists during the war.

The movie didn't make any mention of the artificial flood created by the Chinese Nationalists in 1938, but it did certainly show the internal political workings of the Nationalists and their betrayal of the people of China.  Finding movies about the Rape of Nanking is easiest, because China loves to show Japan as the enemy.  Movies about the crimes of the Nationalists are a little bit harder to find.  And movies about the famine of 1959-1961 and other crimes by the Communists are certainly not what China's current government are interested in producing.  Although the Japanese do have a role in this film, the primary enemy in this film are the Nationalists, and not the Japanese.  And that's one thing that drew me to this film.

The movie follows the main characters that are a wealthy Chinese family that become poor and become travelling refugees as the famine takes away everything that they have.  The majority of the film shows you the famine from the perspective of the starving refugees.  The next most common perspective shown in the film are the political meetings of the Nationalist leaders.  They also show the famine from the perspective of a western journalist sent to cover the war.  The perspective of the Chinese or Japanese soldiers is almost completely absent from the film.  It's nice to see a film about war that doesn't focus on showing it from the perspective of a soldier.  It's nice to see a film about war that doesn't spend a big part of the movie showing off their special effects with gratuitous violence.

So far, this is my favorite film about the events in China during WWII.",1501286400,,2484,4.730232558139535
