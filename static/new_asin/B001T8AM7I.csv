8340764,5,B001T8AM7I,"Random Hearts is undoubtedly  Harrison Fords very best performance to date. The story is capable of touching the Heart of millions who may have endured a similar experience, yet they prevailed and moved on. While they view the movie they may momentarily vicariously experience his sentiments. It is fast moving and the reader will not be able to predict what is coming next. If you have not seen it,  I highly recommend it.  John T. Reading, Sr.",1440892800,,445,4.753246753246753
