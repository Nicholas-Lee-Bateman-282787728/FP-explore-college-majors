3907000,5,B002CNJYV4,"Not only is her dancing amazing, but she is very good at speaking to the 'common' man and breaking dance bits down so you can understand them and do them correctly.  She is a fantastic technician.  I own several of her instructional DVD's and she NEVER disappoints.  Even if you've never heard of Sadie......get it, you'll love it!!!!",1282435200,,334,4.724137931034483
3907001,5,B002CNJYV4,I got my dvd quickly and in excellent condition.  Sadie's dvds are a little more expensive than others but you really get what you pay for.  There is so much material on her dvds and they are are designed to be worked with over a period of time.,1275696000,,245,4.083333333333333
3907002,5,B002CNJYV4,"this dvd is very good to make your drills clear and exelent.sadie explain exactly how to do the moves and take times for that. it is not a beginner dvd, but if you look for new insiration or complete your dance, its a fantastic instruction by sadie!",1270080000,2,249,4.319148936170213
3907003,5,B002CNJYV4,"This was a great video.  Sadie goes over the moves well.  But this is a hard video since it is layering.  I'm still on the basics but a friend of mine an I did this and we had a lot of fun laughing at ourselves.  We will be working on this again because it was such a challenge and informative.

Beginners should start with her basic video instead.

By the way, a fellow dancer of mine just went to one of her workshops and said she was a fabulous teacher.",1254182400,10,456,4.011111111111111
3907004,4,B002CNJYV4,"I have mixed feelings about this dvd, while it is not a total waste if you have other sadie dvd;s you may be in for a dissapointment. A lot of these moves (Majority 98.999%)are covered on other dvd's. So if you don't have her other dvds then this will be wonderful for you, but if you do you probably should not get this. As I figured she has put out so many instructionals that the instruction content was bound to overlap and believe me it did. I am also dissapointed that the promo for this was not longer, had it been I would have known to pass on this dvd. While it is the more expensive of the three in this series this is my lest favorite one. Many of these moves are on her drum solo which she breaks down well all you have to do is drill.

The Menu has these five sections
Play all
Technique
Choreography
Bonus performance
and about Sadie.
Technique-The warm up section is first and talks a bit about layering
the warm up was like any work out you would find in a regualr dance class or on any other Sadie dvd. All stretching. That leads into 9 drill sections

<Horizontal and Vertical upper Body Isolations, these are just chest circles and slides while in a sumu squat position. She changes the level of the squat to help build stamina in the legs.
<Lower body isolations,undulations and floor stretch,this includes hip slides, front and back slides leading into  exterior pelvic circles. The undulations are layered over lunges (I personally liked this one). The floor stretch was an open leg stretch . She gave wonderful instruction with this section which she considers still a warm-up.
<Layering drills: Foundation moves, Which layers basic moves from the chest and hip.
<Layering drills Basic shimmies, this section was okay but I have had better shimmy instructions.
<Layering:ups and downs with hip isolations, I like how the music is right on cue with her isolations.
<Layering: ups and downs with chest circle isolations
<Layering : 3/4 shimmies and chest circles, one of my absolute favorite moves.""and if you have to take a break"". Well said.
<Soft layers"" Undulations and hip circles
<Soft layers"" Mayas and sways with undulations. Not my favorte move but I can see how it can go well in certain songs. The whole undulation while doing a maya honestly looks uncoordianted even when Sadie is doing it. This is practically the only move that is not covered in any of the dvds that I have.

Choreography-The choreography is broken down into three sections.lolol She loves to do the pose hop undulate up. This choreography is a true intermediate dvd. The repetition is great and not too much was thrown in the choreography at one time. A lot of footwork and turns are used. Sadie always does the entire choreo for each section with music. So if she is on section 2 she will do 1 and 2 when it is time to practice with music.

To be honest if you have her drum solo dvd from this collection you will find this choreography tame. But since practice is practice this will be a very good practice session and you may see some combinations you would like to use on your own choreography. I am not a fan of this choreography but it is not a bad choreography to help you practice as she just wanted you to get an idea of what it is like putting the technique together  with music.

Bonus performance-The Bonus performance music was the soul of Cairo by Ahmad Gibah and Orcehstra. Gorgeous costume, while I adore Sadies dance routines I must honestly say something seemed off about this performance. The music was very sensual and I don't know if all the movements thrown in quite captured the theme of the music. Personal taste, the performance does not add or take away from the quality of this dvd.

and About Sadie-The about Sadie is just a written review about  3 paragraphs long talking about her and her dance company nothing no one that know anything about Sadie wouldn't know. This is the same review on her other dvd's that were released this year. Truthfully they could have left it out but since they didn't okay.

This is my 5th Sadie instructional dvd and I feel like a lot of this has already been covered so if you already have a nice amount of her dvds then I would not suggest getting this. I am  very dissapointed I had this on pre-order only to get the dvd and see the moves are on other dvds,  but since I see the use it will have for those who does not collect her dvd's I will not give it a super low rating.
If I had a choice between this and thrillin drillin I would say thrillin drillin all the way.

Again I stress if you are a beginner or beginner intermdiate or intermediate and you do not have many sadie instructinals then this will be perfect for you as usual Sadie is a wonderful teacher of hard brain wired movements. I do not want to deter you because this will be perfect to help enhance your dance and movement vocabulary. Layering drills also help you to pick up other layering moves fairly well. So I will give it a 4 for the content for new sadie students lolol.",1245974400,49,5013,4.471553610503283

8364313,5,B002CNJYV4,"I considered myself an exceptionally good dancer before I bought this DVD, I now realize that I have a long way to go! Sadie really pushes you to refine your craft and perform at the next level, this is an excellent DVD. I would highly recommend it for intermediate-advanced dancers. Beginners may be discouraged by the difficulty of this DVD, I'd suggest trying an easier one, in-person training, or Howcast lessons and getting good at those first.",1425168000,2,449,4.8441558441558445

8364315,4,B002CNJYV4,"I have been dancing for about a year, and i loved this dvd. I find it challenging and at the same time doable. But if you are at a very beginner level, this might be a little too much.",1345766400,,184,3.7435897435897436
8364316,1,B002CNJYV4,"Did not meet my expectations. I enjoy bellydance DVDs where the instructor is in tip top shape, flat abs, and dressed in bellydance costume (at least in performance portion if not in practice sessions). This DVD failed my test. I couldn't even watch more then 5 minutes of the various chapters. Would return but for the fact that only receive 50% of purchase price since DVD open and it cost at least that to return it.",1325116800,,419,4.526315789473684
8364317,5,B002CNJYV4,"Excellent!  I love it and can use it to practice over and over again.  Highly recommended. This DVD is very challenging but Sadie explains the basics and you are able to challenge yourself.

8364318,5,B002CNJYV4,"First let me start off by saying that I am a Sadie fan. Not only because of her amazing talent as a dancer, but she is an absolute brilliant instructor as well. I bought this DVD after feeling as though I had hit a slump with my bellydancing, and I'm very glad I did. This is like the icing on the cake and will take your dancing to the next level. This dvd is chock full of yummy layering and has a cute choreography taught at the end. She also has an excellent warm up routine, which is very much so a drill in and of itself. Who this dvd is not for? Well pretty much anyone can benefit from this dvd. At the time when I bought it, I was probably an advanced beginner or intermediate and have progressed nicely since then. But I would not recommend this for absolute beginners, meaning you have never taken a belly dance class ever in life. For that, I would suggest getting her complete bellydance dvd instead, which is phenomenal as well. For those that are ready, you will get both a mental and physical challenge (and you WILL be challenged) and creative ideas to add to your belly dance routine. You will not regret this purchase. Happy Dancing!",1306022400,9,1152,4.313364055299539
8364319,5,B002CNJYV4,"I would purchase any DVD from Sadie... although I had a few intructional belly dance DVD prior to buying this, Sadie's intructions and moves are more unrivaled",1300320000,,159,4.925925925925926
8364320,5,B002CNJYV4,"Wonderful, comprehensive instructional video. Great if you're looking to advance to  preforming and competing and also if you have a busy schedule.  Well broken down and explained. Two thumbs up!",1283817600,4,195,5.466666666666667
