1785326,3,B00006LPHB,"Why was ""The Country Bears"" released only in a fullscreen version? Why didn't you release this movie in a widescreen (letterbox) version?? Even though the soundtrack was FAR superior to the picture (I liked the picture too, don't be mistaken - I loved the ST) The movie deserved to be released in it's original theatrical version. Things were left out (Missed the Dave Mason poster to Henry's left in Henry's office - The KFI radio billboard as the bus was going into the Toluca Lake Car Wash (On Magnolia @ Cahuenga Bl in N. Hollywood)..etc). I think I can speak for Bear fans EVERYWHERE - Including my buddy Paul Barrie Jr. of ""The Country Bears Playhouse""  - Peter Hastings needs to re-release this movie in the future in widescreen under ""Special - Peter Hastings Director's Choice"" I would be a happy Grizzly!!

1785327,1,B00006LPHB,"I'm probably the only person in the world who really cares about this issue on this particular film, but what would it have cost Disney to have also included a widescreen version of this movie on the DVD? I know we're in the minority, but some of us like to see the whole movie as it was made, instead of some full-screen, shrunk-down, pan and scan version.",1040083200,6,357,4.343283582089552

I thought that it would be another ""little kid"" movie but imagine my suprise when the movie ended and I found myself wanting to see it again! With all the guest appearances by Elton John, Krystal etc. and that adorable Beary, this movie proved to be a wonderful film that the whole family can enjoy! I highly recommend it!",1040083200,6,412,4.227848101265823
1785329,4,B00006LPHB,"I went to this movie not knowing what to expect,not seeing any reviews on it at the time. Reminded me in a way of the muppets where creatures intermingle as if an everyday occurance. Christopher Walken is in a wierd comedic role,(still a psycho though). The hassels the group goes through trying to get back together are sometimes dumb but,hey,what do you want from a Disney movie? I've seen much worse! All I can say is if you think you might want to watch it?,do it!  I've learned to be my own critic,never listen to other people. Everybody,s taste is different. Personally, I saw it twice.",1034035200,5,592,4.584905660377358

1785384,3,B00006LPHB,"I have to admit the bears looked better on screen than the Muppet look I had envisioned before popping the DVD into the player. They can actually pull facial expressions and although they don't entirely look like real bears, giving credit where credit is due, they do look pretty good. The movie itself is a bit forgettable, although it does have a few decent moments by human actors. Although their parts are small such as Diedrich Bader who plays a police officer who along with his partner are as dumb as the thieves in Home Alone. Basically their role is to find Beary, a four year old bear who has run away from his human family as he never someone knew before this that he was a bear, just that he looked different to his mean brother and wondered if he was adopted. Like the universe the alternative universe the Muppets is set in, in this one Bears live amongst humans, and no one freaks out that giant carnivorous animal is working in a bar, or a car wash.

The runaway bear has been a fan of a band called The Country Bears, who broke up before he was born. Why this is the case is never explained. So when he runs away he goes to a giant mountain lodge that was a famous venue they played at back in the day. There he learns Christopher Walken likes to turn up every day to torment the owner who is $20 000 in debt to him as a bank manager and gloat that he will be taring down the place as soon as the bank seizes it. $20 000 dollars seems a pretty small amount of money to me for this situation but it's a kids film after all. Of course the runaway comes up with an idea to put the band back together and have a concert to save the lodge. But most of the old bears don't get along or really want to come back and play in the band so the runaway is going to have to get on board some old bus and convince them to do so. Along the way they're going to have to avoid the cops and the evil plans of Walken.

The music the bears and a human girl and a pub band play is pretty average when you consider this movie is about a band that was supposedly the greatest ever and an influence to the greats like Willie Nelson and Elton John. Surely they could have gotten some big names to write some decent songs or at the very least done covers of some that aren't slow ballads, especially for the concert scenes.",1478822400,,2314,4.117256637168142

That being said, me liking bears doesn't change the fact that this movie is bad.  There's a reason why film studios shouldn't make films based on animatronic creatures one sees in a kiddy restaurant or a theme park:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/they-always-lead-to-disaster/dp/B00000K2SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">they always lead to disaster</a>.  Even if I could swallow the idea that the Country Bears is so renowned across America that they even influenced Jimmy Hendrix, that an adopted bear is traveling across the road to meet the band and no human being bats an eye, it would still be a pretty boring ride.  The bears have no identifiable personality or charm, the jokes aren't funny, and most of the plot relied on coincidence or given itself a pat on the back.

It goes beyond personal nitpicking that the movie has certain issues that bothered me.  As the story goes, the Country Bears were popular until they broke up, and it's up to an adopted bear named Beary to bring them back together.  It never explained WHY they broke up, except for a half-hearted comment from a disgruntled bear, and the members seems all too easy-going to gang up like the disbandment never happened.  Plus, there's that one bear who was saddened that his woman bear broke up with him long ago, but when the two meet once again through sheer story convenience, they just sang a bit and they made up; no arguments, not heated conversations, just made up.  This movie has no real conflict at all; nevermind the whole mission to save the Country Bear Hall from a greedy banker played by Christopher Walker (the only best thing about the whole movie), or the cliche mid-story crisis that lead to the separation until the whole ""family is important"" speech reconcile them, there's no actual trials to challenge these bears to get ahead of themselves.

The musical numbers are tacked-on at best.  One has the harmonica bear involved with a forgettable female singer in a montage of different sets and kids jumping on trampoline which leads up to a concert stage, in what I'm suppose to believe is them rehearsing (yeah right).  Another was when the bears are in a diner, and an inspiring waitress decided to just sing and everyone in the diner started dancing while the place becomes a dance club.  Those are the only two musical numbers in the movie, and considering how few they are, they have no merit to the plot and they just happen for no reason.  On the subject of the unnecessary, the cops involved in the search to find Beary are there just so film can have an illogically stupid chase sequence.  The bears were high-tailing in a tourbus, making hectic turns while speeding which should've had the bus fall on the side and cause massive car piles.  Then bus hid inside a carwash, which shouldn't even fit the vehicle's height.  When the cops discovered them, instead of driving to the end of the carwash to block the bus's path, they cartoonishly drive INSIDE the carwash, where the cops got out and get sucked by the spin brushes (which isn't possible), spat by hot oil (which should've burned their skin) and floating by a blowdryer (without closed space, the heavy dryer should've pushed them back, not lift them up); they could've been killed, but instead gave the cops wacky hairstyle.  Since the cops are basically forgotten after that and how out-of-place the musicals were, it seems like they exist because the movie needs to fill up the 90-minutes somehow.

A few other things bother me, like how a 1200-pound bear get into a stage dive and didn't squash the crowd holding him or how Beary and the Country Bear gang happen to be the only humanoid bears roaming the nation (unless this is implied Beary is an illegitimate child of the band, which can explain the break up in many disturbing ways).  It's so off-the-wall from reality that I had to roll my eyes in anguish.  In many ways, ""The Country Bears"" the grizzly bumpkin version of ""The Blues Brothers""; too bad it doesn't have the humor, the scope, the memorable songs, or the plausible cameos as the John Landis classic.  Speaking of the cameos, those in this film don't even click with the whole Country theme; of course, if has Willie Nelson obviously reading a line, but then later it show a musician like Xzibit!  What is he doing here?  He's about as country as Country Crock butter.

1785555,5,B00006LPHB,"""The Country Bears"" is full of tongue-in-cheek humor - I laugh everytime I see it. The music is fantastic. The production number ""Kick it into Gear"" is an all-time favorite in this household. It's extremely clever and wonderfully executed. Zeb's comment after the number, when asked how he likes his eggs: ""Hot!"" sums the number up brilliantly. If you like good country music, this film is a winner. The dryly delivered lines of Beary's older brother, Dex, who can't figure out why no one seems to notice that his brother is a bear, are sheer genius. The way this movie pokes fun at the obvious, as though it weren't obvious, must have most critics bamboozled - they seem to be too clever to appreciate the humor this film has to offer.

""The Country Bears"" has never lost its charm for us. We have owned it for close to three years, and whenever anyone in the family needs a pick-me-up, ""The Country Bears"" goes into the DVD drive.

1785571,4,B00006LPHB,"Reading the reviews here, I wonder why so many people seem to be so impatient with this movie. I first stumbled across it when I caught a snippet on TV, and I thought it intriguing enough to tape it next time around. Since then, we've watched the tape a few times, and my little one has enjoyed it each time, at ever-increasing ages of course. And so have I!

WE HAD NO IDEA that the movie was based on a theme-park ride, so we weren't biased for or against it on that basis. I suspect that some people have a bias against country music in general, or perhaps it's a bias against people (or bears) with ""country"" accents. I mean, isn't it noteworthy that some reviewers here think that Christopher Walken and Queen Latifah are the only good things about the film, and both of them are highly connected with urban culture?

Well, I like those two performers a lot, too! But if you are open to new experiences, you can also enjoy a bunch of ""Aw shucks"" country boys -- er, I mean bears -- whose main love in life is their MUSIC. And that really is, in my view, the biggest draw of the movie. These are characters who overcome personal foibles, and old grudges, for the sake of great music that can only be created by the collective whole.

And in the process, the creators of the film did a great job inserting a character arcs not only for Beary, but also for his human brother, and for the Bears in general. The two cops provide a great silly counterpoint to the action, and Beary's human parents are spot-on with their sincerity and concern when Beary disappears.

Despite the age of this movie, I am here to shop for a DVD copy, because my kid just asked to see it again, and next time I watch the movie, I want to really enjoy cranking up the volume and getting that extra sound quality that a DVD provides. The bottom line, seems to me, is that if you like a happy ending, and you like good music, and you have kids, you should be content with this movie, in whatever format you find it.",1180569600,,1991,4.287234042553192

I wouldn't choose to watch this movie, or most family Disney movies, unless I was accompanied by my children.

1785573,2,B00006LPHB,"When Beary Barrington, a 4th Grader who also happens to be a bear cub, discovers the humans he lives with are not his biological family but instead adopted him when he was small, he decides to go out and find his place in the world. Beary also happens to be the biggest fan ever of the legendary `70s rock band, ""The Country Bears,"" and his pilgrimage to find a place where he fits in leads him right to ""Country Bear Hall,"" a down-home music hall where the Bears first got their start. When Beary arrives, he quickly finds that Country Bear Hall is in dire straits. The bear that runs the place, Henry, is in the midst of chasing off the dastardly Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken), who is planning to foreclose on and tear down Country Bear Hall if Henry and caretaker Big Al can't raise some big money fast. After getting the grand tour from Henry for 25 cents, Beary suggests they work together to reunite the broken up Country Bears band for a concert to save Country Bear Hall. With no other options, Henry agrees, and he and Beary, along with their human friend Roadie and his sidekick, Mr. Chicken, pile into the Country Bears tour bus and hit the road to find their estranged friends. Reuniting a legendary rock band is no simple task, however, as Beary and Henry quickly learn, and the two dimwitted cops Beary's distressed human parents have sent searching for the little runaway don't make things any easier!

Disney's 2002 theatrical flop, ""The Country Bears,"" is supposedly based on Walt Disney World's beloved ""Country Bear Jamboree"" animatronic stage show attraction. I say ""supposedly"" because the film has so very little in common with the stage show. The two could practically be considered unrelated if it weren't for the title and the names of the bears involved, along with the use of the Country Bear Hall. Many characters from the stage show aren't even in the film, the ones that are there are barely recognizable, and the music style (not to mention the myriad of cameo appearances) is all wrong! Anyone seeing this movie because they are a fan of the theme park attraction will likely be very disappointed. In the show, the bears are animatronic, have cartoonish features but are very ""alive"" looking, and most aren't that large. In the film they are people in massive suits with the same Jim Henson technology seen in the ""Dinosaurs"" TV series and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle films. Fine technology, but why change things so much? The look of the bears in the show is much more appealing and could easily have been done with animatronics, CGI, or an entirely traditionally animated film. Also, the original Country Bears show is a down-home musical revue type show, it's very much old-fashioned country music, and it's very ""hillbilly."" It is most definitely not 70's rock. As much as I love '70's rock, it is NOT what the Country Bears are known for.

Is this a good movie? Well, not really, though it's still possible to enjoy it. As I said, it's supposed to be based on the theme park attraction, but in that regard it fails miserably. It's also supposed to be a satire on `70's country-sounding rock bands like ""The Eagles"" (MY favorite band) and movies about getting such bands back together. It does a decent job on the first part, but just seems like a carbon copy in the latter. Similarities between ""The Country Bears"" and the two ""Blues Brothers"" movies are striking. And since there aren't enough strong jokes, it seems more like a rip-off than a satire/spoof. What's worse, the musical numbers by two female stars are such bad choices that they make ""Country Bears"" look like an EXTREMELY low-budget rip-off. Where ""Blues Brothers"" had performances by Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles, ""Country Bears"" had performances by two female singers I'd never even heard of (and still haven't), and the first was a song totally mismatched with the movie. Surprisingly, Don Henley and Bonnie Raitt actually perform one song, but only as the singing voices of two of the bears. They then appear in cameos as two bar patrons watching the duet. These are the folks that should be performing WITH the bears, a la ""The Blues Brothers,"" not folks we've never even heard of! In the musical highlight of the film, we at least do get to see a great musical duel between a bear named Zeb and the great Brian Setzer. Other appearances were from the likes of Queen Latifah, Elton John, and random celebs like that. Still, I was left wondering why this ""Country Bears"" movie didn't have many big names from the world of country music. Willie Nelson, the type of celeb that should have been filling up this flick, had a cameo that lasted like 2 seconds. This movie should have had appearances from the likes of Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, anybody from HeeHaw that might still be alive, and the Blue Collar Comedy guys. I guess I just can't shake the knowledge that a true ""Country Bears"" movie should be more Li'l Abner than ""The Muppet Blues Brothers.""

So, I said it was possible to enjoy this movie, and you are probably wondering, ""How?"" Well, you will have to cringe through at least one musical number (that first one I warned you about), and probably every time someone mentions ""getting the band back together."" But, if you are a fan of classic rock bands (especially ""The Eagles"") and can lose yourself in the film's goofy humor that is sporadically successful, the likes of Christopher Walken, Diedrich Bader, and the very talented voice cast might allow you to have a passably good time. That is, if you can get past the fact that this movie throws almost every aspect of the theme park attraction out the window for the most part. Much of the Bears' music is pretty good, and that helps greatly. Plus, the bears are fun to look at, though not as much as the theme park originals. The film works somewhat as a road-trip movie, though a completely unoriginal one disguised as a rock `n' roll movie satire based on a Magic Kingdom country music show. Bottom-line, it's a fairly bad movie, and not so bad it's good, but it's fair enough to be mildly entertaining. The DVD is nicely accompanied with some meaty extras, such as two television programs made to promote the movie: ""The Country Bears: Out of the Woods Mockumentary,"" and ""The Country Bears Concert for America."" Both are very good companions to the film, as they add to the illusion that the Country Bears were once a famous, legendary `70's rock band. There's a rather funny commentary track with the director and two of the bears (one is Diedrich Bader's voice, who never fails to crack me up), though this commentary is purely for entertainment purposes only and not truly informative. There's also a music video editing game, a sing along option for the film, and a Krystal music video (though this is mostly seen in the film and is the very musical number I have mentioned as completely out of place in the film). With all those extras, it's surprising the film is currently only available in fullscreen.

Now, I can't recommend this film to the general public. All I can say is that if you like family films, especially Disney ones, then you might be able to squeeze some enjoyment out of this one. This is especially possible if you are a classic rock/southern rock fan and if you can accept that it mostly disregards the theme park attraction it is named for. Some would readily use this film as an example of why movies based on theme park attractions are a bad idea. Ha, a lot of those same people still flock to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies though. Frankly, I also rather enjoyed ""Haunted Mansion"" and the made for TV ""Tower of Terror,"" silly as it was. The fact is, it's all in how you make it. A truly great Country Bears film is not impossible; one that truly IS based on the theme park attraction in every way. Disney could have made a wonderful animated film based on the Country Bear Jamboree, sticking to the theme of a group of musical, hillbilly bears that like to put on shows in their woodsy music hall for any tourists that might happen by. They could have used all the characters from the show and designed them to look and sound much as they always have. Perhaps they could have even used some of the songs from the show too. Sadly, that will probably never happen now that the 2002 film has come and gone with only a whimper.",1162857600,,8359,4.638326585695006
1785574,1,B00006LPHB,"I normally give a lot of leeway to kids' films, but leaving the theatre on this one, all I could think was ""That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back.""  There are two blissfully pleasant minutes in this movie--the two minutes in which Queen Latifah, always grand, makes her appearance.  Otherwise, it's dull, plodding, and nearly unwatchable, with a plot that has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.  The main character, the young little bear, flees his house within 5 minutes to chase after this Country Bears band, after learning that he's adopted.  There's no buildup at all explaining 1) why this little kid feels compelled to run away (since his parents, for the brief fleeting moment you see them, seem nice enough) or 2) what this Country Bears band is supposed to be about or why the kid is so obsessed with them.  Nevertheless, you're supposed to care about the picaresque adventures that follow, when the boy bear meets all the band members and bizarrely persuades them to put the band back together.  The musical sequences, to the extent they appeal at all, can't begin to make up for the banal storyline.

The movie's one virtue, other than blink-and-she's-gone-Queen-Latifah, is that there is nothing in it to offend (excepting the little kid running away at the drop of a hat, in the first place).

1785576,4,B00006LPHB,"To get the negative part of this review out of the way, the plot is unoriginal and hokey, a ripoff of the Blues Brothers. But other than that, it is quite entertaining. The music was well worth the movie. And the different cameos which appeared of Don Henley, Elton John and the like were priceless.

Beary Bearington, who didn't know he was adopted, goes to see the Country Bears who he idolizes, only to find that they are in disarray and the Country Bear Hall is in danger of being torn down. He sets to get the band back together and save the hall, despite the setbacks on the way. And, I was tapping my foot to the wonderful music. I wish it had a better plot, but one can't have everything. I was entertained, and enjoyed myself in this movie, as well as the DVD and its features. Well worth seeing.

They also should've stuck with the original country bear songs instead of having the Bears sing ordinary songs. They could've at least stuck memorable songs like ""Bear Band Serenade"" and ""Blood on the Saddle"" in the film. Another majhor disappointment was that they did not have the 3 talking animal heads on the wall or the raccoon on Henry's hat-they could at least had those to make the film more enjoyable.

1785601,3,B00006LPHB,"""The Country Bears"" is a good family film.  It isn't the best movie Disney ever cranked out, but it will hold your attention for about an hour and a half.  It follows the story of young Beary Barrington, a boy/bear unsure of his purpose in life.  He doesn't fit in with his human family(or at least that's what he thinks), so he sets out for ""Country Bear Hall,"" where he believes he'll fit in.  When he gets there, the place is about to be leveled to the ground, so he decides to reunite the band for a benefit concert.  What follows is a good, clean family film about friendship, family, and tons of musical cameos.
It has a solid cast of well-known and not-so-well known actors.  Christopher Walken plays the sore loser turned destructive banker bent on destroying Country Bear Hall.  Deidrich Bader and ""Chill"" Mitchell play two goofy state highway patrolmen.  Haley Joel Osment provides the voice of ""Beary."" Steve Tobolowsky plays the fun father figure of this film.

The film has a good overall message, but some younger kids may be turned off by the pace.  It does introduce the younger lot to musicians like Don Henley, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Elton John, Brian Setzer, and Don Was.  It also has cameos by stars the youngsters will probably recognize like Wyclef Jean and Queen Latifah.  I think that's what I like most about this film.  It covers the Country Bear's ""influence"" across the board and manages to mix a number of musical genres into one.  From hip-hop to rockabilly, it's all covered here.  The Country Bear band has a Southern rock sound, with a little Eagles thrown in to boot.
For good family fun, I recommend this one.",1082332800,7,1650,4.641379310344828
1785602,2,B00006LPHB,"Walt Disney Pictures used to be the center of original family entertainment year after year. It used to be the studio that all others looked up to for the next big thing for children young and old. What happened?! It seems the once center of fantasy magic has had a drought in the department of original ideas as the company recently announced the rollout of three live-action feature films based the Mouse House's theme park attractions. The first of these to test the mainstream waters is The Country Bears with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and The Haunted Mansion soon to follow. Along with these attraction-based features, the studio will be digging through their archives and updating such classics as The Shaggy Dog and Freaky Friday. Will this work in revitalizing the studio's sagging box office returns? Hard to say at this point but critics have already given a thumbs down on the matter.
The story focuses on the adventures of a young talking bear out to discover his roots and reunites an old band in the process. Beary Barrington (some joke, huh?) always knew he was different then other boys but when his older brother informs him that he is adopted, the bear cub runs away figuring he doesn't fit into his adopted family. Beary sets out to seek his higher purpose in life and along the way he falls upon Bear Hall, the former home of his favorite band, The Country Bears. Unfortunately due to conflicting issues amongst the band members, they broke years ago and the Hall is faced with destruction if $20,000 isn't paid in time. Beary's new mission is to reunite the old members of The Country Bears so that they can perform a benefit concert to save Bear Hall before it meets the wrecking ball. The story for The Country Bears resembles that of the theme park attraction, from which this is based on, in that it offers a few catchy tunes but the performance wares on as the show rolls along. The uninventive storyline is all too familiar to the plot for the Blue Brothers 2000, thus the whole movie seems uncontrived and lacking in the least sense of substance.
Most of the main characters for the film are ... well, you guessed it, bears! Actually, they are audio animatronic puppets, created by the talented folks at Jim Henson's Creature Shop, who have facial expressions controlled by puppeteers off screen but have a person inside the costume walking through the scenes. Granted there are some human characters within the feature but they are as interesting as the audio-animatronic bears. Beary's family, unfortunately, is like any other typical Disney movie family complete with the loving father, worried mother and punky older brother. These were the least interesting characters in the film, which defeats the film's message of the importance of family entirely. Deidrich Bader and Daryl Mitchell offer some off-beat comic relief as Officer Cheets and Officer Hamm (get the joke?) but intentions can be deceiving especially by viewing the trailer for the film. They aren't nearly as funny as television spots made them out to be and the filmmakers seem to know this as the two officers seem to disappear completely near the end of the film. The only redeeming factor is the casting of Christopher Walken, who never seems to disappoint his fans. He presents a relatively serious character in the beginning but manages to make humorous in the long run.
Overall, The Country Bears is one of the most unoriginal feature films of the year and quite a disappointing start to Disney's theme park feature rollout. There is little to compliment this film, though one can make the argument about the music. The songs themselves, for the most part, were catchy and get your foot tapping every now and then but if you want to go for the music then just go to the local store and buy the soundtrack. The main problem with the musical numbers, though, is the feeling that they are too staged. Someone in the course of the film would utter a one line comment and then suddenly the entire cast would brake out into a song and dance number. Outside of Christopher Walken and some of the songs, The Country Bears leaves little to the imagination. Note that the film is intended for children and thus this review may be meaningless to them. Take this into consideration when taking the children to the film. But if you are a parent and hate to be dragged to this then follow my suggestion: Sit back, relax, pay attention when Christopher Walken comes on screen, tap your foot to some of the music and thank God that they didn't make an It's A Small World movie.",1077148800,,4594,4.729426433915212

""The Country Bears"", based on Disney's own attraction off Disney World, is flat out cheesy. The bear-lives-among-us theme isn't quite believable but still adorable on every ASPECT. (Which they should bring the Bernstien Bears to the big screen!) When Disney gets tired of making dozen's of sequels to beloved classics, only finding their way to the direct-to-video-piles and when Disney can't think of another ""Honey, we shrunk the Disney execs"", Disney starts creating plot points to their own attractions. While ""The Country Bears"" is underrated, it still didn't come on to strong. Kids under 4 just don't give a .... anymore. They want to see smartass Sherk's or another Toy Story. Disney just doesn't have it anymore (note: maybe because some brainless company fired a brilliant producer, who then went to Spielberg to form Dreamworks, which is not just kicking Oscar ... but also kicking Disney's as well). Disney has now developed a plan...for the next couple of years, they will bring to life their own attractions. With the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" released couple of weeks ago, ""The Haunted Mansion"" in a few months...it will be interesting to see how the kiddies will react to Disney's approach.

After reading media reviews, however, I was certain this movie was going to be a certifiable dud.  Which only proves you should never listen to the media critics.
The movie is about a young bear whose favourite band (something like a cross between the Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead, but all bears)has been disbanded for 10 years, and their iconic hall (something like the grand ole opry) is going to be destroyed by an unscrupulous landlord.  The movie doesn't have the typical non-stop slapstick comedy kids films seem to think are necessary (although the carwash scene definitely made me laugh).  Most of the fun parts revolve around the cameos by Brian Setzer, Queen Latifah, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, etc and if you're a fan of country-rock and blues, you should like the film.  The appeal should be there if you feel nostalgic about the old Disney country bear hall too.  While young children might find the film slow, older kids and adults who recognize the value of getting back something lost and a good music soundtrack should appreciate the movie.",1048032000,22,1196,4.753623188405797
