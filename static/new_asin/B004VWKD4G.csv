4484853,3,B004VWKD4G,"Let me say first that Dinisaur Train is very popular in our house, but this is my least favorite of the six we own.

Pros: like all the Dinosaur Train DVDs, it is based around a theme (unlike Dora, for example). This theme is Therapods, with half the DVD involving an extended visit to the Dinosaur Big City with an Elvis Presley like Cryolophosaurus (sp?). Another couple episodes also feature the ""King"".

I also really appreciate that PBS puts so few ads in the front (unlike almost everyone else!) and makes these DVDs so reasonably priced.

Cons: these episodes seem to have swapped the usual gentle pace and simple songs for a much busier, complicated style. The King character grated on me pretty quickly too. Also, the episodes are out of chronological order. The four city episodes are in order, but the subsequent episodes have the children going from being bosom buddies with King to meeting him for the first time and learning things they already knew when the DVD opened. This didn't bother my 4 year old, but it bothered me.

One caveat: King C is a classic introvert, and his fame makes him uncomfortable. He also gets nervous before performing. Children with similar issues might find this valuable for that reason.",1422144000,,1231,4.765258215962441

4484861,5,B004VWKD4G,"This is a great compilation of the regular short segments (usually 11-14 minutes on tv) that create a movie!  We especially love the songs and the fact that all of our favorite characters are there!  The only one that my nephew likes more is the A-Z set, which has allowed our entire family to memorize 26 species of dinosaurs.  The Big City features King (funny Elvis parallels), who is a favorite character of ours, and a journey on the Dinosaur Train!  All we need is popcorn!",1365638400,,479,4.534883720930233

4484865,5,B004VWKD4G,"My 2 year old (soon to be 3) LOVES Dinosaur Train!  This one is super cute with an ""Elvis like"" dinosaur that cracks my son up.  The stories are so cute and educational.  We don't let our son watch actual TV so these PBS videos are great to give him the down time while teaching him things all at the same time.  As a parent I always feel comfortable allowing him to watch Dinosaur Train.  Never anything scary or inappropriate.",1355875200,,428,4.3
4484866,4,B004VWKD4G,My daughter loves dinosaur train and so she loves this movie.  Would recommend for any child fan of the show.,1354492800,,109,4.45
4484867,5,B004VWKD4G,"We purchased this DVD for a recent road trip.  My three-year-old daughter adores it.  She can be sensitive to anything she perceives as ""scary,"" and despite the subject-matter being dinosaurs, this DVD doesn't scare her in the least.  She finds it very amusing and laughs the whole time.  When she's finished watching it, she often pretends to be the dinosaurs in the show.  It's a bit long for her to watch in one setting at home, but it's perfect for a trip out of town.  Overall good buy.",1346198400,3,491,4.5227272727272725
