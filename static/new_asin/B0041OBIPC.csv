8413069,5,B0041OBIPC,"I'd been watching my TV on my roku and just took an idle look to see what was new on Acorn TV. Saw this series and figured I'd give it a try. Really is an amazing series. I like the real, 3D, unpredictability of these characters. Lots of flaws to blend with many admirable characteristics. Like in real people and not the plastic dolls that much of television presents. The stories are well written and there are bits of history of the characters thrown it. The main character is Henry Farmer, a gifted barrister with an unfortunate love of gambling and women. His father (wonderfully played by Edward Petherbridge of Lord Peter Wimsey fame) and the 'silk' QC of the group played by Cherie Lunghi (who played the matron in the incredibly brilliant series The London or Casualty 1906 as it is sometimes called) add Christopher Fulford who's been in innumerable British cop shows and well, you have a series that really leaves you wanting more and more!",1399939200,,951,4.666666666666667
