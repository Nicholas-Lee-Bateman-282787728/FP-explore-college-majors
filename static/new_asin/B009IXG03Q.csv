5341247,5,B009IXG03Q,"I purchased this DVD several months ago along with his latest book (also a must have).  As I recall, this DVD was full of interesting details about the artist and his personal history.  Very interesting.  An inside look at one of the best artists ever (yes, ever, of any genre).",1379548800,2,278,4.52
5341248,5,B009IXG03Q,This DVD is a fantastic life journey of one of the greatest western artist ever. It was fun to watch the road Howard Terpning took from young student to the amazing western artist and great storyteller in pictures that he became. It was interesting to see the long and complicated process from initial idea for a painting to the final finished work of art.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has seen a painting of Howard Terpning's.,1355702400,4,440,4.569620253164557

8542141,3,B009IXG03Q,"I thought that for a short biography on Howard's early illustration days to his masterful easel painting days it was good. As an artist however, I would like to have seen more of his actual painting process. I thought that the part with him visiting his wealthy friends/collectors in their mcmansion where some of his paintings hang took away from the poignancy of his work.",1420329600,,374,4.769230769230769
8542142,5,B009IXG03Q,A very great movie about a very great and wonderful artist. I am so glad I was able to watch this movie. I believe it was made by his son Stephen Terpning who has passed away in August 2014..,1419120000,,191,3.923076923076923

8542144,5,B009IXG03Q,"This is a wonderful profile of the artist and goes into detail about how he produces his large canvases. It's always interesting to sit down with a living artist and hear about his approach and his process, his inspirations and how he got started. I admire the complexity in Terpning's paintings. This goes on the shelf next to Maynard Dixon Art and Spirit, my all time favorite artist and also a great documentary.",1404172800,,415,4.698630136986301

8542148,5,B009IXG03Q,This is a great DVD on not only the art of Howard Terpning but more on the type of person he is.  And how he became a great artist from his humble beginning riding on the subway.  Just a pleasure to learn about such a great man and artist.,1380931200,3,239,3.857142857142857
