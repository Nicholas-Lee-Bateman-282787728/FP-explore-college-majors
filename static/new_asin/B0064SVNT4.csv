4953063,5,B0064SVNT4,This is a very good movie and it truly has a lot of life lessons here. This could happen to anyone. My family really enjoyed it. Especially my sons who are athletes.,1329004800,,165,4.1875
4953064,5,B0064SVNT4,"This is a very touching movie. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is an awesome actor and this movie shows his talent. I won't go into the details so I won't spoil the movie. However, there are many life lessons in this film. Enjoy.",1325980800,,222,4.309523809523809
4953065,4,B0064SVNT4,"""It's just a challenge, just another challenge that's all"" Deon (50 cent) is a college football superstar. He is set to win the Heisman Trophy, play in the national championship football game and be one of the top picks in the NFL draft. Weeks before his big game he is rushed to the doctors and is diagnosed with a tumor. His days of football are over, and he is left to try and start a new life. Going in I was very worried...a movie written by and starring 50 cent...oh God...here we go. I was very very surprised at how good it was. I'm not saying this can compete with ""Remember The Titans"" or ""Express"", but I really enjoyed this movie. I have never been impressed by 50 Cent's acting, but he was actually really good in this. I may have been distracted by the physical change that he went through. Going from a ripped football player to a 160 pound cancer patient is actually pretty impressive and for someone to go to that length for a movie shows how important this was to him. Overall, a surprisingly good sports movie with a surprising performance by Curtis Jackson. I give it a B+.",1325030400,14,1093,4.389162561576355
4953066,3,B0064SVNT4,"50 Cent plays Deon, a college football star running back headed for the NFL and life on Easy Street. He has everything, fame, parties, girls etc. His kid brother, Sean rejects 50 cents lifestyle. He is the more studious type I gathered from the stereotypical glasses that he wears. Mom is Deon's main cheerleader, and dad, who has been there, wants Deon to be a more aggressive ball hog and less of a team player in order to attract the pro scouts. Even at home, Sean (Cedric Sanders) plays second fiddle to the football star. Deon can have any girl he wants, including the girl dating his brother.

However...Thing Fall Apart. Deon has the big ""C"" growing in his chest.  Ray Liotta plays the doctor. While the family is in a waiting room, Ray comes in with an x-ray and shows the family the giant tumor in Deon's chest. Radiation and chemo. Dad, concerned about Deon's draft pick, wants to keep a lid on this in order to deceive the NFL. Mom is not crazy about the idea.

As Deon's life whittles away, he finds doors that were once opened to him have closed and life without being a football star is hard. Curtis' acting ability has improved since the last time I saw him, although it still leaves much to be desired. Strong performances by the supporting cast (not Ray Liotta of course.) There were some minor plot issues. Cedric Sanders made the movie more than 50 Cent.

F-bomb, sex, sex talk, no nudity",1324166400,13,1407,4.5058823529411764
4953067,5,B0064SVNT4,"I was very impressed with this movie. Having seen 50 Cent in other roles, I was pleased to see him branch out as an actor to a role less similar to his real life persona. You also have to respect his dedication to the craft, losing so much weight to realistically play the role. There were a few things that seemed kind of low-budget (e.g. 50's wig and the football scenes), but overall an outstanding story.

One of the highlights of the movie was Mike P, the comedian playing 50's best friend. He did an excellent job of bringing humor to a serious situation. Mike P is definitely a comic on his way to the top, not to mention incredibly handsome! I hope to see him getting more work very soon.",1323820800,,696,4.312977099236641

4953069,5,B0064SVNT4,"This movie was great! It was also sad and made me cry. To me this is a great movie for everyone to watch because it talks about how someone can be up one moment and have all kinds of friends, and down in the blank of an eye and people don't know who you are.

4953072,4,B0064SVNT4,"Remember, when it was rumored that 50 Cent was sick because he had lost so much weight?  Well, one thing that could have been the issue was that he was preparing for the role as Deon Barnes in All Things Fall Apart.  All Things Fall Apart  is about life, choices, and change.
Deon (played by Curtis 50 Cent Jackson) grew up as a champion athlete.  While Deon was thriving as an outstanding football player his brother became subpar and had to find his own calling in life.  As the brothers grew up Deon was set to go pro and join the NFL but one day all of that changed.  He was told that he would never play ball again due to his sudden illness if he did it would cost him his life.

Deons family was depending upon him and he felt that he had let them down because he was unable to now go pro.  His brother who worked in an auto dealership, as an upcoming manager, seemed to surpass Deon as Deon struggled to make a mental shift in his new life.  Deon had to begin making decisions about what he needed to do to make the necessary adjustment for the life that he now must lead.  How will Deon fair in the end?
If you are looking for a movie that will take you through the challenges of life, living and give you an ounce of hope viewing All Things Fall Apart is a great choice.",1459468800,,1279,4.100401606425703

4953075,2,B0064SVNT4,"As to not make this review completely bad, I will say that Curtis Jackson had his moments of real, emotional, raw acting. Other than that, this movie was a complete train wreck. It made no sense, there were so many plot holes I couldn't keep track. The flashbacks didn't make any sense, the timing of a lot of scenes were totally off. Let's think about this for a minute: 1. if the star football player who was going to be a top draft pick in the NFL got sick, there is NO WAY he would have just ""dropped out"" without any questions asked. Administration and coaches would bend over backwards to get him put on medical leave from school and red shirted for the season. 2. The coach would have never said ""you can't get a job here because you're sick and the school doesn't want to be held liable."" He could have sued their pants off. 3. Why was Ray Leota the oncologist delivering his test results at the beginning of the movie, but at the end of the movie he all of a sudden couldn't give the results because he ""wasn't an oncologist."" 4. How did he live in a college dorm room that was GIGANTIC and had a wall of windows that overlooked the city? 5. If a doctor told you your son had a life-threatening tumor, would the first think you'd worry about be his football career? 6. why did that girl go from being 50's girlfriend to the brother's girlfriend back to 50's girlfriend? That was SO CONFUSING. 7. His mom must not have been a very good caterer if she was only bringing 2 dishes of food.  8. HIS HAIR. OMG HIS FAKE DREADS. WHYYYYYYY.  9. How the heck did the brother, in 4 months, go from being a college kid to a GM of a car dealership? 10. That saturn hybrid wasn't even made in 2011. How was it ""new?"" 11. 50 cent, his mom, and his step-dad are all the same age. 12. The whole brother getting into Columbia thing made no sense. Why would he get a GM position and then go to Grad School in a different state? 13. Why did the names on the scoreboard not match the names on the uniforms? 14. Why was the gatorade ON THE FIELD??? 15.  Why would a community college have a football team, and why would they stay there for 4 years? 16. The counselor didn't recognize him after FOUR MONTHS OF BEING GONE?? 17. Why did 50 cent and that girl walk SO SLOWLY down that hall?? 18. The white party: the mom was doing the catering but again only brought 2 covered dishes?? To that big ""upscale"" party? c'mon! 19. There was no backstory or character development 20. His college football coach, who he was supposed to be so close with, didn't even ask him how he was doing after he was sick.....

I could go on and on. For such a hyped movie, with a reported 7 million dollar budget, the writing was awful, there was clearly no fact checking, and the lines and acting seemed out of a high school play. It was pretty laughable.",1423958400,,2820,4.245810055865922

4953099,5,B0064SVNT4,"I thought 50 cent did a fabulous job before and after his prognosis of terminal cancer.  I was crying through out most of the emotional scenes.  I think this film is for those  individuals who are looking a character who experience initial fame, unaccomplished dream yet redemption in a much emotional way for an ending. Emotional because you know the flawed protagonist  will die yet before his death death,  he took the time to bring his family together. To me, such a sacrifice is a  demonstration of  selflessness characteristic that should be recognized  and appreciated.",1404172800,2,576,4.989473684210527

It was very believable.

4953156,4,B0064SVNT4,Thank god for Amazon Prime.  Without it I would have never found this gem of a movie.  It's your typical sports story.  A talented athlete who happens to be a jerk has everything taken away from him one day and then you follow his journey to be a better person without the sport that he always had.  The acting in the film is very good even 50 cent gave a 3 star performance.  I won't spoil the ending but I found it a lot more realistic to life than most films.  Overall not the best film in the world but if you want to kill a couple hours and want something good to watch.  This is not a bad choice,1353456000,,601,3.9583333333333335

4953168,3,B0064SVNT4,"First I would like to say that The story for a sports themed movie was original and better than seeing the same stupid things like the hail mary for a touchdown or buzzer beating shot in the final seconds. The bad thing was filming the football game in an arena football stadium with no sidelines,wrong team name on score board,and the players/uniforms looked more like a semi pro league than  division 1 college football. But the plus side is the acting was pretty good. There were some pretty deep moments in the movie like trying to become a man and losing everything plus going on in life when it seems there is nothing to live for. The message They were trying to send was great and doing a movie like this breaks the monotony of the cliche. You actually feel you like you got something out of the film other than some team winning the championship so in that sense it is worth watching if you can get over the low budget football scene. Pretty good movie.",1346198400,,961,4.429378531073446

The weight loss scenes were crazy to watch - he didn't even look like himself. This film is worth watching at least once. I'm sure I will watch it again in the near future.,1340064000,,286,4.415094339622642
4953173,2,B0064SVNT4,"Wow, where to start ...

50-Cent wears a horrific dread-lock wig for the first half of the film. It actually looked better once he removed the hats he was wearing. One weight lifting scene he was putting up 315 pounds and then the next he goes to the student gym and is doing 175 pounds and acting like it's 315 to impress a girl that he sleeps with right after.

Deon's (aka 50-Cent) stepdad (and the film's creator Mario Van Peebles) runs an auto shop called, ""Mistah Fix It"" ... seemed like they were trying to fit a stereotype there. His mom refuses to pour a drink for a bar patron while her son is on TV, but she can easily argue with him for 2 minutes instead of just grabbing him the beer he ordered. Uh... ok. Later in the movie, back at the bar, his mom orders her son some pork chops and collared greens and the gal working at the bar has a great delayed response, ""ok, I'll do it right now."" had me in stitches.

The budget of this movie had to be less than $50,000 as the uniforms for his university looked like a DIII school and the ""big game"" bowl game was played in a dome, likely an arena football venue as the yard markers were actually on the field during a punt return and so were the players - there was no sideline room! And after the ""big game"" the mom said Deon had a national title game two weeks later --- so I guess the NCAA got a playoff system? Wishful thinking...  And during that big game the scoreboard read: ""Lakers"" and ""Chargers"" but the opposition had ""Thunder"" on their uniforms. No attention to detail was paid.

Sure Deon has NFL dreams, and is a Heisman trophy candidate (as the school paper indicates), but only one coach is running the program and for some reason, school officials, media and everyone else is kept in the dark about Deon's cancer ... the time frame of the film jumps all around as well.

Deon's girlfriend, who he stole from his brother, and him were dating (aka sleeping with each other) for one day before his big game, then he got cancer ... but later in the film it does a look back where the girlfriend had a serious talk with Deon about not sleeping with other women ... when did this take place? Right after they banged for the first time on the first night they hung out? ""When I close my eyes and imagine my future, it's your face I see."" Uh...after one bang session? He was moving waaaaay to fast. haha - just no sense of a timeline.

Then Deon goes back to his University to see how far he is from graduation, it's been like 6-months I think ... or maybe just 4-months and his counselor recounts to him that the school once had a great football player with the same name ... YEAH, 4 FREAKING MONTHS AGO!!!!! Not 40 years ago! What the heck!?!

Before cancer, Deon found his true calling ... scamming people into paying more for used cars then they are actually worth. His stepdad was selling some hunk of junk for $10,000 ... Deon comes in pretending to be Joe-Schmo and offers $12,000 for the car ... then $12,500 ... this gets the old guy to up his offer above the listing price to $11,000 ... HONEST BUSINESS? NOT AT MISTAH FIX IT!

Then once cancer hits, Deon is down and out and trying to get his life in order ... he turns to his brother who works at a used car lot and begs for a job, his bro throws him out, and then on his walk (to perhaps the gutter) Deon gets lucky as some Texas Oil Tycoon pulls up and wants to buy a Chrysler for whatever amount Deon can offer up, his quick thinking gets the guy to buy the listed $11,500 car for $10,500 ""before the owner gets there"" and axes the deal. This is the typical stereotype of used car lots ... Deon is a success at ripping people off ... just as good as he was on the football field that allowed him to have one night stands at a rapid rate.

Then when the feel good story starts to wrap up, his cancer comes back ... his Doctor that shot it to him straight (Ray Liotta ... he must have needed some money fast to do this film) takes him out to the parking lot ... so perhaps Big Brother can't listen in and recommends that Deon die with some dignity instead of seeking miracle treatments for his returning cancer ... now in his brain. Um, what?

But perhaps the best scene is the final one ... to see 50-Cent run like a fool from the white tent/white suit party - only Steven Segal runs goofier ...",1339372800,,4327,4.213768115942029
