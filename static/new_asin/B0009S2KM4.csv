8065969,4,B0009S2KM4,I bought this vol. to go with the art box I ordered that contains vol. 3. The art work is nice and the animation is also good and clear. The dvd arrived in nice style and no damage. Sadly though when I ordered this one and vol. 1 and the 3rd vol containing the art box The art box was on backorder and they refunded my money. So I went ahead and ordered the 3rd vol and art box again through someone else here on Amazon and it came with both vol. 1 and vol. 2 which was crazy so now I have an extra vol. 1 and vol. 2 which I'm not complaining about.,1351296000,,549,3.782608695652174
8065970,3,B0009S2KM4,"Tendou Rushuna is a female Senshi with very ample assets, and a knowledge of the handgun that would put and sharp shooter to shame. Her love of baths, her long blonde hair, and her bubbly personality are accented by her seemingly endless supply of ignorance.

Basically, a blonde bimbo with a big gun.

Now don't get me wrong, im all for a gun wielding scantily clad women, but i was also hoping there would be a driving storyline and some plot twists along the way.

Its mostly one misadventure after another until the end when everything comes to an end very abruptly. They did all the could with what they had, and it was an enjoyable 12 episodes, however it won't rank among my favorites.",1232323200,,692,4.52
