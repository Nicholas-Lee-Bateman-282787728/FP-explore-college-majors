8300121,5,B001F0KBU8,"All things are not equal, or should I say ""Disney,"" when it comes to great illustrative animation, the kind of animation that has seemingly died with Pocahontas and Mulan; even those films have computer ""tampering.""  It may be true that the resources to produce cel and or stop-motion animation may be too prohibitive in this CGI generation.  While I see computer animation as an evolution, I do miss the old-fashioned way.

I never saw the Americanized Snow Queen, even on TV, before watching this disc, nor do I want to.  What we have is cell animation at its finest. While the previous generations of the Russian films have been released, with varying success according to my fellow reviewers, this version is eminently watchable and hopefully complete.  While the colors are highly saturated. this version could hardly be called ""restored.""  The re-mastering has caused a distinct graininess, not intrusive but definitely perceptible.  The projection cues (white circles at the end of each reel) have not been removed and there are plenty of unretouched scratches and flaws.  The soundtrack has not been restored either, to make the most of the lovely score.  Strangely, the print of Atamanov's Golden Antelope is in much better shape, albeit slightly soft-focused.

Atamanov's style was transformed over time: the influence of UPA, Czech animation, and other European style affected him.  Backgrounds were eliminated, and his films became just brief statements in the shorter films on this disc..

I gave this release 5 stars because it is rich storytelling and excellent animation.  The lead character of The Snow Queen is quite a stubborn, determined, petulant little boy, somewhat cruel, and certainly a character that Disney would have ameliorated into ""wise beyond his years and kind."" Atamanov lets him be a real little boy.  That in itself makes the film worth seeing.",1434844800,2,1880,5.161716171617162
8300122,5,B001F0KBU8,"Assuming you are looking for the Russian animated (1957), dubbed into English version featuring the voices of Sandra Dee and Tommy Kirk, preceded by a live action introduction featuring Art Linkletter, the one that used to play so often on TV in pre-VCR days, that is.  This version still sends shivers down my spine with its incredibly moving depiction of heroine Gerda's unstoppable quest to free her playmate Kay from the Snow Queen's clutches, a dedication that inspires almost everyone (and everything) she meets into similar efforts to help her.  If you ever saw it, you know this; if you never saw it, you owe yourself (and your children) a viewing.

The good news is that the film was recently restored, and you've found this Films by Jove (2006) version right here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen-Golden-Antelope-Bench-Cyclist-Fence/dp/B001F0KBU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen - Golden Antelope - Bench - Cyclist - Fence</a>&nbsp;along with four other animated films also directed by Lev Atamanov with the original Russian soundtracks and English subtitles.  Although the restoration isn't as perfect as you might have expected these days, the biggest improvement is that the nighttime scenes are quite clearly visible in their entirety.

The bad news is that the English dubbed soundtrack was NOT made available, not even as an option!  IMHO this was an inexcusable lapse, particularly given the concerns of those involved over income being lost to public domain editions like the one I'm recommending instead.  Well, if they'd had the sense to include the English dubbed soundtrack (preferably restored), along with the Art Linkletter intro, the montage accompanying Sandra Dee's song ""Do It While You're Young"", and the English Opening and Closing Credits with the title song (all preferably restored) as options, who would buy a PD version ever again?  Now, anyone looking for the version they remember has no choice but to do so!

Discotek Media was faced with a similar problem when they reissued a trio of Japanese animated classics that also used to play regularly on TV in Fred Ladd English dubbed versions:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.  Besides offering the original Japanese soundtracks with subtitles, they also give you the option of watching the pristine restored film prints with restored versions of the old English dubbed soundtracks.  Only a fool would buy a public domain or pirated version of these films now!

The good news is that the classic English dubbed version featuring the voices of Sandra Dee and Tommy Kirk, preceded by a live action introduction featuring Art Linkletter, is available from Osiris Entertainment (2009):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B00394DW2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>, which is essentially identical to the Westlake Entertainment Group (2004) version here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B0006HU2X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>, except that the Osiris version comes in a proper DVD box, not a flimsy cardboard sleeve.  In addition&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen-Plus-Bonus-Features/dp/B000BYPHPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen Plus Bonus Features</a>&nbsp;contains this version along with several other things.

(Amazon has unfortunately grouped together the reviews of several different versions of The Snow Queen so before purchasing make sure to follow the links provided in this review in order to get the version you actually want.)

The bad news is that the print is in pretty sad shape: scratched, spliced, and so dark that the nighttime scenes are all but invisible.  The soundtrack also has a lot of glitches.

Note: If, like me, you were a little surprised when you first learned that this film was Russian not Japanese animation, it turns out there just might be a reason.  It seems that a young Japanese animator who was discouraged and ready to quit and do something else went to see this film in a theater and came out truly re-inspired.  The name of this young man whose future animation work was almost lost forever?

Hayao Miyazaki.

That's why his Studio Ghibli has released a DVD of the restored version with Japanese subtitles here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B0015U3N2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>.

Note: The 2-disc version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fairytale-Adventures/dp/B003NFM3UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fairytale Adventures</a>&nbsp;from TGG Direct, the one that says ""9 Hours of Animated Films"" on the cover, turns out to contain a different print of this film on its second disc, without the Linkletter intro, without the annoying audio and video glitch at the beginning, but also without the entire sequence with the robbers!  Not recommended.",1387929600,7,5617,6.68543956043956
8300123,5,B001F0KBU8,"Here is yet another overseas animation that I saw for the first time on You Tube! I saw Lotte Reniger's THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED, the first known animated feature, on You Tube and ordered it on amazon.com! That beautiful silent animation from the 1920s has great cut out silowette animation made in Germany! The Russian animaters that made this movie in 1957 clearly understand much better then today's Disney animaters, how the old Disney artists told a story! Their version of THE SNOW QUEEN is faithful to both the character, content and meaning of Anderson's tale while using the techniques and story ideas Walt Disney used in his telling of both SNOW WHITE and THE SEVEN DWARFS and PINNOCHIO! Having watched the whole movie on You Tube, I prefer the original Russian sound track over the american dub.

I'm not saying I don't enjoy ANY english language dubbing of a foriegn animated film! The american dub of Japan's ALAKAZAM THE GREAT with the voices of Jonathan Winters and Peter Fernandez (SPEED RACER) is a lot of fun! And the Disney Company's dubbing of Hayao Miyazaki's  SPIRITED AWAY and other Miyazaki movies has been excellent! But the english language subtitles of SNOW QUEEN are just smarter and more faithful to Anderson's story then the american dub dialogue! And the music of the Russian sound track is better too! Lev Atomanov, the directer, was smart in using Anderson's character, the Sandman to be the narrater and storyteller of the movie! The animaters animate him like Jiminy Cricket in PINNOCHIO complete with his little umbrella and his hopping from bookcase to earth globe to explain the herione Gerda's adventures in her search for beloved Kay who has been kiddnaped by the cold Snow Queen! In the original story, a magic mirror created by an evil magician breaks and splinters into tiny fragments that enter a person's heart and soul, making them cruel and heartless.

The russian film has the Snow Queen owning this mirror and she cracks the mirror and commands the fragments pierce the hearts of humans and make them cold and cruel! Great animated snow effects enhance this snowy adventure from start to finnish and the music makes one feel Gerda's stuggle against the snow to make it to the Queen's palace near the North Pole!! When she and Kay are reunited, the ice splinter fell from his eyes and his frozen heart became warm again! In the original story the Snow Queen had left her palace before Gerda got there and there was no confrontation of her and Gerda. But Atomanov knew it was better for them to face each other so we could see Gerda defeat the Snow Queen's magic with her strong love for Kay! So the Snow Queen just vanishes before our eyes and then we see Kay and Gerda returning back home with the help of Gerda's friends that she met on her way to the Snow Queen's palace! This russian film doesn't talk down to kids like so many current fantasy movies do! And as a bonus you get 4 more animated russian films directed by Les Atamanov! The 30min GOLDEN ANTELOPE is an east indian tale that reminds me of the live action THE JUNGLE BOOK starring Sabu (Who also starred in THE THEIF OF BAGDAD directed by Alexander Korda!) Since this film was made before THE SNOW QUEEN I could see how much the animaters had improved in the animating of the human characters in the later SNOW QUEEN. Gerda and Kay are more expressive as the heroine and hero then the indian boy in GOLDEN ANTELOPE and the other Anderson characters show good animated exaggeraton in their body language! It looked to me like a large amount of rotoscope was used in GOLDEN ANTELOPE since the animation of the east indian characters so closely resembles live action film.

The 10 min. Bench is all pantamine so no subtitles are needed. The human characters are beautifully animated with funny encounters, all on a park bench with really cool music! So you get a lot of interesting, colorful Russian animation on this russian language dvd! The only criticism I would make is there is no scene selection or chapter stops on the SNOW QUEEN so I had to visually fast forward to see individual scenes instead of skipping around from scene to scene but other wise the dvd is great! The restored color is vibrant and all images are clear and sharp, even the night scenes are clear and sharp! I noticed a tape splice a few times during the movie but that's the only tecnical flaw I could pick at! So I highly recommend it!! So I say, who needs to watch Disney's new cgi FROZEN when you can watch this beautiful hand drawn, hand painted russian animated movie version of the classic Anderson tale!!?",1387411200,,4609,4.665436654366544
8300124,3,B001F0KBU8,"Finally, Lev Atamanov's masterful Russian animated classic from the 50s in its original Russian language with english subtitles. This alone qualifies this as a must-have for fans of great world animation, but be informed there are some problems with this release. Apart from the terrible package design (which is worse than many PD releases) there are a few authoring problems with this release. While image quality is adequate, there are no chapter stops within either feature and in an apparent attempt to curb piracy (this is a Soyuzmultfilm authorized release) some scenes have been converted from color to monochrome with blue tint. Still, even taking these things into account, this is the best way to see this film, with the original Russian voice characterization and very good sub-title translation.",1254700800,12,808,5.271317829457364
