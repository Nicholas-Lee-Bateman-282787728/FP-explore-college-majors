We also liked the fact it did not have bad language and nudity or things  you see into todays movies.",1037664000,4,228,4.27906976744186

7882204,5,6305076669,"One of the creepiest Goosebumps episodes, the tale of a family who gets lost trying to find a zoo and ends up at a very unusual (and deadly) amusement park instead. The eerie quietness of the sparsely inhabited park makes it seem chillingly realistic, and some of the things that happen to the kids and their parents are pretty bizarre. Lizzie is almost crushed to death when the walls of the house of mirrors close in on her, Luke has a close encounter with a hairy tarantula, the family encounters a monster carrying the talking head of a teenage girl in one hand, and the father almost faints when he discovers that the monsters are actually real. Details are well thought-out too, showing the remnants of families who weren't so lucky, as we see glasses, dentures, strollers, picnic baskets, and a totaled car strewn throughout the park. Also adding to the creepiness is the fact that the Morris family's own car is a beat-up, 1980-ish Chevrolet station wagon that looks like it is going to collapse at any moment, and it almost doesn't start when they are fleeing the park. And, finally, in a scary departure from the usual standard of family entertainment, there is no happy ending. One of the monsters attaches a device to the car that allows him to control the steering, and he uses this to send the car teetering over a cliff, which is the last thing we see, leaving us wondering whether they plunge to their deaths or are somehow miraculously rescued.",1196035200,,1461,4.666666666666667
7882205,3,6305076669,"It's an alright 2-episode video tape, but it only includes 2 episodes and it's only 44 minutes long. Instead of releasing the episodes seprateley R.L. Stine should really considder releasing

Goosebumps, Season 1, 2 and 3. I would ask for more seasons, but that's all they got, 3 seasons, that's it. And if you read my review on the Scary House DVD then you probably know I thout that was a season. Oh yeah if you haven't seen these episodes yet then don't pay $20 for it.",1136160000,,472,4.425287356321839
7882206,5,6305076669,"This was one of the most GREATEST Goosebump movies I ever saw!!!!!! It was very funny too. All the acting was GREAT!

 This one was almost as good as ""The Haunted Mask""!",1118534400,,169,4.25
7882207,3,6305076669,"This was an average Goosebumps video. It is average because it was a little peculiar and annoying that these monsters have the own theme park, tv show, and channel. The mother in this video WAS SO ANNOYING, that I even felt like going there and slapping her. It was also a little funny that the two kids thought they were having fun until they found out they could not escape, which got a little scary then. Decent video, but do not buy. If you really want to see it, then find it at some video store and do not buy it.",1109289600,3,519,4.148514851485149
7882208,3,6305076669,"What can I say? I was entertained during my viewing of this episode. Although not one of the show's best, it was often quite funny and sometimes a little forbidding and eerie; but obviously, it is more designed to frighten little ones. This episode was alot of the time designed to be more humorous than scary and for the most part, it succeeds in being a nice little two-part episode. Obviously not on the same lines as ""The Haunted Mask"" episode, but it still was entertaining.",1074124800,3,479,4.5813953488372094
7882209,3,6305076669,"I read this book back when i was about 8 and i was so thrilled with it, the adventures and the character and just the twistedness of was great! The movie WAS twisted, it DID have good characters, and there adventures WERE pretty good, but it was NOTHING like the book, and well, the book stories were better some of this book is just a little it too ""Fox Kids"" like, if you know what i mean, the grim and morbidness was gone.....
go read the book, it'll be better for your brain!",1072656000,,479,4.161290322580645
