8321022,5,B001MEM7CW,I paired this DVD with a read aloud about earthquakes.  I found a quiz on-line that accompanied Bill Nye's DVD.  My students were filling it out as they viewed this DVD - good accountability! The visual aspect helped them thoroughly understand earthquakes and I was surprised how much they learned during our read aloud.  (4th grade),1501027200,,333,4.910714285714286
