780644,1,6304108869,"There is no doubt that Brewsters Millions is a wonderful comedy. Richard Pryor really does steal the show with his performance. Unfortunately, and it may be that I got a faulty dvd, but the sound track was so poor I had to turn it off. As I said in the title, it is a great movie and I really do love it, but this dvd was a lousy buy! Oh, and for those of you that think it might be my player or the region code, none of the above as I not only have a world zone player but one that can be programmed to a specific zone such as 1, USA, 4 Asia/Pacific. And I have purchased other dvd's from Amazon with no sound/vision problems. So, I have to say it is the disc...",999648000,,663,3.8823529411764706

780646,5,6304108869,"Hmm...let's see...For starters, I would buy myself five or six mansions in different parts of the world, possibly start up a car collection, or perhaps take a few dozen trips around the world and deposit the rest in a bank account. The point is, ""Brewster's Millions"" is a delightful comedy that stars Richard Pryor as a down and out ex-professional baseball player who must spend thirty million dollars in thirty days. If he is successful, he'll inherit $300,000,000. Sounds easy, right? The catch is that Mr. Pryor must have no assets of any kind after the thirty days to obtain the money. John Candy co-stars as Pryor's buddy and is an ""en route"" benefactor to Pryor's real fortune. Stephen Collins also co-stars as an attorney who would like nothing more than to con Pryor out of his millions so he can obtain the fortune for his future firm Granville and Baxter. Pat Hingle does an outstanding job as the overseer of the conditions of Montgomery Brewster's (Pryor) great uncle's (Hume Cronyn) will. All this makes for a well-crafted, suspensful comedy. o do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of ""Brewster's Millions"" today. Chuck Fleming (Peter Jason), Action News!",970185600,12,1172,4.865

The overall plot is that Pryor has 30 days to spend 30 Million dollars if  he wants to gain an even bigger fortune.  The movie provides quite a few  gags.  The gags don't all work, but the concept is so interesting that it  really doesn't matter.

780897,4,6304108869,"BOTTOM LINE: Richard Pryor makes for a lovable loser. Film plot is an everyman's dream. The ensemble cast is quite good and director Walter Hill (known more for action stuff like 48hrs.) keeps Pryor from going too far of the chain, and thus more believable. Some foul language although not too much, (especially considering this IS a Richard Pryor movie. LOL). All-in-all, a pretty good little comedy. The zero frills Blu-ray from Sony is a letdown, but at least the picture & sound are solid. 4 STAR movie, 1 STAR Blu-ray.

THE STORY: Down on his luck minor league baseball pitcher Monty Brewster gets a chance to change his life forever when he learns that a distant relative has left him a fortune. But wait, there are some rather odd stipulations that must be followed: he has to spend 30 million  in 30 days but have zero assets to show for it. If he succeeds, he inherits a full 300 million. If not, he gets zilch. Also, if he agrees to try for the big money he cannot tell another living soul - or he forfeits it all. Lastly, he can pass on the challenge, under a provisional ""wimp clause"" that would give him one million up front, and just walk away. What will he do? What would YOU do??

THOUGHTS: Umpteenth adaption/remake of George McCutcheon's 1902 novel is an enjoyable semi-family friendly outing from the surprising team of comedian Richard Pryor & director Walter Hill, (neither of whom are known for wholesome, family-friendly product. LOL.) Aside from some occasional blue language, this is a pretty straightforward old school/screwball style comedy. Pryor and John Candy make an amusing duo, and a solid cast of supporting players help make this film a lot of fun. Fairly low key for a Pryor flick, but that's a bonus here, IMHO. Some of Brewster's solutions are inspired, and it's always a hoot to put yourself in the hero's place - wondering just how you would tackle that enviable(?) challenge.

THE BLU-RAY: Absolute zero-effort hi-def offering from Sony. Film just autoplays. The only selectable option is subtitles On/Off. That's it. Quite disappointing. This appears to be a basic 1080p transfer with no tweaks, improvements or restoration of any kind. Thankfully though, the video & audio quality is pretty strong. Picture is clean for the most part, though nothing to rave about. The sound is clear & the mix is level. Sadly, no bonus features at all.",1496534400,3,2379,4.781021897810219

780954,4,6304108869,"Richard Pryor and John Candy start off as no name minor league ball players. They are then cut loose.

Pryors character then finds out that if he spends 30 million and has no assets in 30 days then he gets 300 million. Loosely based on the prior film of the same name.

This is a great movie especially at first viewing as there is the thrill of the game as Pryor schemes to spend so much money.

Kids at the time 30 million was much more than today. There is a good ending filled w suspense. Very good movie.",1489881600,,509,4.121212121212121

all Universal have done is upgrade the picture quality with new 1080p transfer & upgrade the sound mix to 2.0 master mix
I can say the new HD transfer does look very good much sharper & clearer than the old dvd version
but that's all your going to get from Universal
cause there's absolutely no new extras not even the original theatrical trailer has been added
pretty pathetic effort by Universal
tragically John candy & richard pryor have passed away over 17 years ago now
but Director Walter Hill & producer Joel silver could've been interviewed for this new blu-ray for sure
tragically Universal didn't bother making the effort, pretty sad
amazon are selling this for $8, this new reissue is worth $5 or less in my opinion
for now i'll be keeping my 2004 dvd reissue

They are the best things about this movie, too, but, in this case, they aren't enough. This is a very flat screwball comedy.

781920,5,6304108869,"""Brewster's Millions"" is a fun film starring the late Richard Pryor (See No Evil, Hear No Evil,Harlem Nights) as Monty Brewster and the late John Candy (The Great Outdoors, Delirious) as Spike Nolan. Monty Brewster has a chance to inherit over 300 million dollars from his late great uncle.  However, Brewster has only 30 days to spend 30 million dollars without accumulating assets.  He must also avoid telling those around him the underlying reasons for his behavior.  The film hints at this difficulty shown through Spike Nolan doing what he can as a caring and true friend to help Brewster increase his financial fortune. Naturally, Nolan is shown being justifiably confused when he notices Brewster's discomfort when his income rises.  The part where Brewster decides to go into politics is humorously entertaining. I also enjoyed watching ""Brewster's Millions"" so much that I plan to watch it again in the future because the film joyfully takes a light-hearted approach on encouraging the movie watcher to question what they would do if placed in a related situation, minus the dangerous clause of having to do so within 30 days and being able to maintain and/or increase the financial fortune for at least one lifetime. The following additional actors/actresses are also in this version of ""Brewster's Millions"": Lonette McKee, Stephen Collins, Jerry Orbach, Pat Hingle, Tovah Feldsuh, Hume Cronyn, Joe Grifasi, Peter Jason, David White, Rick Moranis, and Alan Autry.",1377993600,,1474,5.206751054852321

Some people may find him hammy, but I actually find him quite enjoyable and believable.  There are human moments where you realise how unique an actor Richard Pryor was.  He was one of a kind.  Plus there weren't many Black actors in his position at the time, before or since.  That's one thing that strikes me as I watch it today - unless you count a Jamie Foxx.  Or Chris Rock, etc - but it's not quite the same.  Pryor had a different presence that made him ""everyman"" and yet this strangely comedic, neurotic but capable character.

John Candy is actually youthful and exuberant in this too.  Rick Moranis has a cameo too.  Great to watch.

REVIEW
A well-constructed cast including Richard Pryor and John Candy, and decent character actors of yesteryear such as Lonette McKee, Stephen Collins, Jerry Orbach, Pat Hingle and Hume Cronyn, make the most of a great idea that is otherwise ill-served by a mediocre script and perfectly standard direction from the usually quite brilliant Walter Hill. Candy's chemistry with Pryor is first rate - why Pryor instead chose Gene Wilder as his long-term comedic partner will forever remain a baffling mystery.

While Brewster's Millions is not the funniest film of the 80s, certainly there are moments of hilarity here. Watch  for a side-splitting cameo from Rick Moranis.",1231027200,,890,5.253521126760563

782218,2,6304108869,"I've heard just about everything now. I know pop culture stinks when an endorsement for this movie is that ""it would make a great reality show."" What a review! I love Richard Pryor and John Candy. And the 80s was probably the first decade where I really sank my teeth into movies like never before. But this movie is no more than a vehicle for the 2 main stars, and not a great one at that. It's fun and it does have its moments, but it's predictable, for the most part, and silly to be sure. This was the point where Richard Pryor was being given mere fluff. For the groundbreaking comedian that he was, this movie is cannon fodder. It's full of archetypes (including the once funny Yakov Smirnoff as a cab driver), and uninspired ones at that, that go as far as their introduction. There simply isn't the gut busting laughs that any one who grew up with Richard Pryor has grown to expect. At best a few giggles. There are some warm moments that give the flick something to stand on. And the story in general is at the very least a fun rags to riches adventure, though with some not so inventive ways of spending money. While this may be a nice movie to see 2 one time beloved comedians, it's not their best body of work in which to do it with. That's not to say this movie isn't worth a watch. Frankly, it's typical 80s fluff, but that can be said about a lot of movies from the 80s, including some that I watch habitually out of nostalgia, taking me back to a time and place. But I would bet that a majority of those who like this movie also think that ""The Cosby  Show"" of the 80s was actually a funny comedy (which it absolutely isn't). If you really like Richard Pryor, buy some of his more hilarious stand up stuff. Even the uneven ""Stir Crazy"" is funnier than this movie. If it's for nostalgia reasons, go for it. 2 Stars is generous, because 3 would put in a league of much more deserved movies.",1202601600,,1904,4.259668508287293

Entertaining and underrated comedy flick is perhaps one of my favorite comedies ever! this is based on an original 1910 novel of the same name but i think this is the best adaptation of that story yet.

782292,5,6304108869,"First, let me say that I love this movie.  Brewster's Millions is great, and I'm biased.  The combination of sports, comedy, and a great movie idea cannot be understated.

Richard Pryor and John Candy (as Monty Brewster and Spike Nolan, respectfully) are hilarious, delivering punch-lines, comebacks, and pithy comments throughout the entire movie.  They're both washed up baseball players who, because of Brewster's unexpected inheritance.  He's got to spend 30 million in 30 days without letting anyone know, without having any assets at the end of the 30 days, and be totally broke.  If he's successful, he gets 300 million, the real inheritance.  It's an ingenious idea for a movie.  How would you do it?

Personally, I don't think it'd be that hard to do.  I'd hire a bunch of celebrities to do things for me, essentially what Brewster does on a smaller scale (if they didn't bite at the offers, I'd hire washed-up celebrities that resort to reality tv to stay in the public eye).

I'd hire:

-Halle Berry as my personal bather, like the women that bathe Eddie Murphy in ""Coming to America"" (same outfits)

-Mike Tyson as a bodyguard

-Dale Earnhardt Jr. to be my chauffeur, make him speed excessively, and pay for his tickets and bail as needed

-Mariah Carey to sing me to sleep every night

-James Earl Jones to narrate my daily life (BOOMING VOICE: Jason wakes up.  Jason opens the fridge to get milk for his cereal.)

-The Laker Girls to celebrate every time I opened a door, and Michael Buffer to announce my entry

-Jessica Alba to be my personal masseuse

The possibilities are endless, and the 30 million would be gone well before 30 days.

782294,4,6304108869,"I've never really been a huge fan of most of Richard Pryor's films, but I have to say that ""Brewster's Millions"" is a very funny movie.
The film revolves around Monty Brewster, a baseball player with dreams of making it to the major leagues. One day he discovers that an uncle he knew nothing about has left him an inheritance because Monty is his only living relative. Monty's uncle tells him, via video before he died, that he wants Monty to absolutely hate spending money. He wants to test him. So Monty has a decision to make. He can either spend $30 million in 30 days WITHOUT having any assets and ultimately inherit $300 million or he can take $1 million and be safe. Of course Monty chooses to go for the $300 million, and what happens next are some of the craziest, funniest, and kindness acts you'll ever see in a film. I won't give away the ending, but you'll be amazed at how hard it is to spend $30 millions and not have any assets to back it up.
John Candy does a good job playing Monty's best friend in the film. It's a shame that we lost him so many years ago. It's also a shame that Richard Pryor can no longer perform like he used to due to his illness.
I would highly suggest this film because it is not only funny, but it also wraps you up into the lives and some incredibly funny and fortunate people!",1062460800,23,1322,4.25
782295,5,6304108869,"Richard Pryor, John Candy, what a movie!  When this came out I died laughing, and now that I own it on DVD there is no difference!  Trying to spend $30 million in one month seems hard for Richard Pryor (he needs to meet my wife!) but he has a blast trying.  The movie stays a step ahead of what I am expecting and that's good, because I tire quickly of predictive movies.  This one is a classic!",1046563200,,395,4.090909090909091
782296,4,6304108869,I liked this movie as a kid and I still enjoy it once and a while now.  Richard Pryor has always been a great comedian and many of his movies are some of the best comedies around.  Brewster's Millions has an interesting twist that appeals to most peoples fantasies and to watch Brewster try and achieve his golas just gets very interesting.  John Candy is very funny in his supporting role and it is great to see Brewster lose it when his attempts to blow the maoney on stupid investments actually pay dividends.  The film is not outrageous and is pretty standard but certain elements like the decorating of his office really are hysterical moments.  Definately worth at least a rental.,1045699200,2,686,4.636363636363637

782298,4,6304108869,"This was great. Imaging inheriting $300 million. All the things that you could do and accomplish. But, there's a catch. In order to get the money, you have to do something first.
You have to spend $30 million in 30 days. Not too bad you say...  At the end of the 30 days, you can't have a single dime left. Nothing but the clothes on you back. And, while you are spending the money, you can't tell anyone why....
Now, throw Pryor in as the person doing the inheriting and Candy in as his best friend. They are both down on their luck minor league baseball players. Pryor is spending millions and Candy is along for the ride. After several days, Candy tries to get Pryor to stop ""wasting"" the cash....
The things they buy and do....  So funny.
What would you do in these circumstances? Don't forget, nothing must remain at the end of 30 days.....",1009324800,10,845,4.375796178343949
