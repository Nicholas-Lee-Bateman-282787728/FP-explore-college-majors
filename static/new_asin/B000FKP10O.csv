8124128,4,B000FKP10O,"A & E Biographies tend to be ""safe"" in what they choose to cover. I felt this was done well, but could have been more risky in going deeper on the different aspects of Mr. Cayce's life. It is excellent for a beginner or someone new to Edgar Cayce, but for people who have a deeper knowledge of this man and his work, it left me wanting more...",1421798400,,343,4.0588235294117645

Thank you!",1419120000,,48,6.0
8124130,4,B000FKP10O,Four stars to A&E for making an informative video about the interesting Edgar Cayce.  I'm not so sure that Edgar Cayce is all he claimed to be but his story is interesting.,1416960000,,172,4.375
8124131,5,B000FKP10O,"This is an excellent, thoughtful documentary but nowhere near as dramatic as another one that appeared on one of the cable TV channels but never seems to have made it to DVD or VHS.  The other one is based on the book ""An American Prophet"" by Kirkpatrick.  That very dramatic one is on Youtube in some form.  Some of the material is the same but you probably would want both if you are really interested in Edgar Cayce -- there are important segments that are unique to each documentary.",1414972800,,487,4.449438202247191
8124132,4,B000FKP10O,"The Edgar Cayce biography covers the unusual life, talents and financial ups and downs.  This was done in a somewhat low key manner.  Cayce gave life readings of people that revealed things that were surprising to his clients  as well as himself.  He revealed past lives; in depth medical analysis and cures; past civilizations, and the nature of life, death and spiritual progress.  Over the years, these readings have influenced many thousands of people through his books.  The biography is worth the price.  However, if you are interested in more, I highly recommend his books.",1409011200,,580,5.042105263157895
8124133,5,B000FKP10O,"I may be a little out of the box on this, but I'm left thinking that Cayce tapped into the collective conscience of a singular energy that runs through everything and everybody. He seems to transcend any such illusions as time and space, while being present with ""the energy"" and present with his intent to serve a greater good. Could it be that he is just a cosmic evolution of a long line of prophets who understood the power of unconditional love in serving a greater good?",1382313600,2,476,4.482758620689655
8124134,5,B000FKP10O,"The video I received came a lot sooner than I expected by standard mail in excellent condition. I was looking for a show on Edcar Cayce that I saw on the History Channel and I'm not sure this was the right one. While it was interesting, it was a little dry.",1316131200,,257,4.0588235294117645
8124135,3,B000FKP10O,"This was a very intriguing topic.  They claim that this regular American protestant could fall into a trance and divulge volumes of information, historical, philosophical, and theological about the nature of society mankind and all other issues listed in the news.  Some people think his ability was unsubstantiated and lacked the burden to real evidence because there was no way to see if his predictions would come true because they were forecast hundreds of years or even thousands of years into the future.",1296086400,,510,5.132530120481928
8124136,4,B000FKP10O,"This is a fair (OK) Biography of ""The Sleeping Prophet"". It delivers the majority of information in a matter of fact way but some of the info is a bit off base. Cayce is often judged on earth change statements that He never made or that were taken out of context using a string of words removed from sentences to imply a different meanings than what was intended. The readings given over His life show a knowledge of past & future events that have only been confirmed with the latest archeological & scientific discoveries. His prediction of the ""shifting of the poles"" is what we are all calling ""Global Warming"", only His prediction came over seventy years ago. This is an overview of the basics. Doubters don't even bother. The toughest thing to influence is a closed mind, and a mind is a terrible thing ""YOU"" waste.",1212105600,14,820,4.585034013605442
