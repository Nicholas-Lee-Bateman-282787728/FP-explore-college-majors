7751592,4,B01FRCEVDM,"Stone (Nicolas Cage) and Waters (Elijah Wood) are Las Vegas cops and certainly not their finest. Dave Waters likes prostitutes and drugs. Jimmy Stone, is straight, a bit inept, and lives with his dad. Jimmy comes across a bail receipt for a bar back for $200,000 cash. Upon investigation they discover one of the most secure vaults in Vegas as this turns into an ""Ocean's Two"" as our cops coldly go rogue.

This was not your typical cop team. They are not tough guys nor overly clever. The film was quirky funny when you consider the situation and dialogue. The two seemed to be miscast by design as everything is amiss,

7751593,3,B01FRCEVDM,"The Trust stars Nicolas Cage as Jim Stone, supervisor in the evidence room of the Las Vegas Police Department. When he stumbles upon the location of a hidden vault belonging to local drug dealers, he devises a plan to make off with the dirty cash that is sure to be stored within. But getting inside and getting away with its contents won't be easy. For help, Stone turns to his pot-smoking pal David Waters (Elijah Wood).

This comic thriller focuses on two losers who see a big payday and go for it, even though theyd be breaking the law and likely incurring the wrath of drug dealers who don't look kindly on having large amounts of cash stolen. The planned theft is a highlight of the movie, even though its necessary to suspend disbelief when we see how quickly the pair acquire safecracking skills. In the second half of the film, the heist becomes increasingly complicated and leads to more than one surprise twist.

Cage, who has not been terribly selective of late in the movie roles hes taken, does a reasonable job as Stone, through his performance does contain distracting Cage-isms such as bland dialogue delivery, wide-eyed stares that suggest an unbalanced mind, and demented laughter. The chemistry between Cage and Wood works in a bizarre kind of way. The drugged-out haze in which Woods Waters lives is initially amusing but  wears thin.

An interesting casting note: 90-year-old Jerry Lewis plays Stones father in a straight dramatic role consisting of only a few scenes with Cage. Lewis is very good and would be welcome in an expanded role.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary with directors Alex and Benjamin Brewer and the featurettes The Dynamics of a Duo and The Visuals of Vegas. A digital HD copy is included.",1470096000,12,1762,4.801980198019802
7751594,2,B01FRCEVDM,"The Trust seemed like it would be such a great movie, then you watch it and wish you hadn't wasted an hour and half of your life. Region 4 DVD also comes with an extra which is pretty lengthy and basically is a documentary interviewing the cast. There amongst the normal this is the best movie, we've real happy to be cast in it, couldn't believe how great the script is norm, you learn the girl playing as listed in the credits Woman, is a musician. You know this as she drops into conversation with the interviewer when talking about the director, then others drop it into conversation about her. They also tell you they were trying to show the world Vegas that isn't normally portrayed, deliberately not including The Strip.

But back to the movie itself The Trust revolves around a couple of doormat men, basically the other police officers bully them into doing whatever they want, such as look after a tractor at a police/court seized items auction instead of doing your job at a crime scene. Cage's character's father treats him like he's useless. Elijah Wood's seems like a guy who got locked in his locker at the police academy. Anyway Cage notices a guy is bailed out with $200 000 in cash, and knows that guy shouldn't be worth that much money so goes undercover at a Vegas hotel where the guy works. There he takes photos and Wood's character notices the kitchen cool room has a ridiculous amount of locks. These two corrupt cops conclude it must be full of cash and decide to rob it.

It has a bit of sudden violence which does bring up a few chuckles when it happens, but ultimately The Trust is pretty slow and boring. Not the great movie I had expected it to be.",1468972800,2,1678,4.462540716612378
7751595,3,B01FRCEVDM,"""You know, a good cop is going to look at it and know exactly what to do."" Stone (Cage) and Waters (Wood) are cops who are in charge of collecting evidence from crime scenes. After looking at a routine case Stone notices something out of the ordinary. After digging he thinks he has found a chance to get rich and asks Waters to join him. What could go wrong? As many of you know I am not a Nicolas Cage fan at all. I think he is overrated as an actor, way over the top, and takes himself too serious, like Sean Penn serious. I say that because this is a perfect example of that. The movie is not that bad at all, but Cage doesn't look like he is having fun at all. Wood seems relaxed but sometimes you can see him forcing himself to calm down. The chemistry between the two is so distracting that it takes away from the movie. The movie itself isn't bad and is decent, although a little generic. This movie also features two things that cannot be overlooked. The greatest waste of Jerry Lewis in a movie I have ever seen, and a scene where Cage says ""open it"" about 100 times and it makes it hard to take him serious. Overall, this is a movie that could have been good but the chemistry between the two actors is just off and hurts the movie. I give it a C.",1466812800,5,1258,4.097165991902834

7751597,4,B01FRCEVDM,"It has been a very long time since Nicolas Cage has done a good movie. This movie is a very good movie though it has a very twisted ending. If you ask why it is good? Then,

1. Good screenplay. Throughout the whole movie, I never felt boring. It had a decent pace with moderate ups and downs.

2. Good acting. Though it was not stellar, you'll have to appreciate their performance. You can feel Jims greed and Davids tormented thoughts.

3. Twisted ending. A bit unexpected ending but it completes the movie. I don't understand why people complains about it. But remember the movie's name is ""The Trust"" and the ending depicts it perfectly.",1497225600,3,640,4.547826086956522

7751602,3,B01FRCEVDM,"I really thought this was at best a 2 1/2 star flick.  I round it up to 3 because of the nice touch of casting Jerry Lewis in a supporting role playing Cage's father.  He was perfect.

The basic story line was easy enough to follow, but the ending was bizarre, and if there were clues in the movie to explain it, I admit to having missed them.  Elijah Wood was good as the pot smoking sidekick who, apparently, has recently lost his wife.  Cage, as usual, played himself, and turned in his standard performance, which was fine.  If you've liked Nick Cage in other movies, you'll like him in this.  If you haven't liked his previous performances, you won't like this one either, as he breaks no new ground as an actor.

This wasn't a horrible way to spend an hour and a half or so, and I don't regret having watched it.  I thought it was really funny at times, and it held my interest throughout.  It's an ok, albeit forgettable flick that will leaving you scratching your head about what happened in the last 10 minutes.",1487808000,,1020,4.349206349206349

Elijah Wood's Waters is a drug using, prostitute visiting cop with apparently no redeeming character traits. Cage's Stone seems like a good guy but really just isn't.

Even in the worst movies, he always gives a strong performance and I enjoy watching him work, but even the Academy Award winning actor couldn't save The Trust. Cage plays Stone, a lifelong cop still on the bottom of the pecking order. Luckily for him, he's paired with the much younger Waters (Elijah Wood), another cop with few aspirations. Together they don't make up a team of elite crime fighters, so on their off hours, they're small time criminals, and as it turns out they're not great at that either. One day while investigating a case, they notice a safe in the evidence room and decide to bust it open, what's inside leads them into a mess of police corruption. For starters, this movie doesn't make sense! Everyone talks in riddles, it's impossible to know who is on what side, and most important of all, what's the point? If these guys are corrupt cops, why do they care so much when they discover that they aren't the only ones? They're losers who don't care about anything, until they find out there are other bad cops, then all of a sudden they are Starsky and Hutch?
