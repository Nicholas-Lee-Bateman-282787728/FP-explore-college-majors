7973051,5,B00006SFLA,"So I probably wouldn't do all the workouts on this video but the point of it is to give you a taste of Ruff Ryders music and tell you that you don't really need all the gym equipment to get out there and build up your body, you can use lots of stuff outside to workout! GET AT IT!",1398124800,,280,3.76271186440678
7973052,3,B00006SFLA,"I bought this video for the cheap price and because I had seen some of it's clips on youtube. I wanted to get some new ideas on bodyweight workouts and you can definitely find a few new ideas here. The bad part about the video is that the guys do the workouts but don't explain how a beginner can get to that level or improve the current level they are in. It's not very long, about 30 minutes or so, but it's entertaining and like i said has some new ideas. if you don't mind spending 6 bucks then it's no big deal. If not just look up some bodyweight exercises on youtube or other websites.",1297123200,,592,4.112068965517241
7973053,5,B00006SFLA,"First off, let me say this is extremely helpful if you want to use non-apparatus equipment with the exception of pull up bars to build your upper body. These guys are really masters of upper body strength when it comes to calisthenics, if you can get past the urban slang which is really heavy throughout the tape you can really enhance your workout and get great tips. Personally, I love the tape and have integrated in my workouts, and they have long lasting effects for me as well. For lower body well that's a different story I suggest you go elsewhere for that.",1286582400,,566,4.504854368932039
7973054,4,B00006SFLA,A very good way to learn different bodyweight exercises.  These guys are not joking around.  The exercises may look easy but they are actually quite tough and will get you ripped and strong as hell.  I would give it five stars if the program was a bit more structured.,1171584000,2,268,4.428571428571429
7973055,4,B00006SFLA,I liked this DVD.  The guy who reviewed this before that seen Superman Pullups in gym class is on [drugs]. ...  No one does this stuff in Gym class!  Way beyond normal pullups.  He either didn't do the workout just watched it.  Or he's hating.  No other options.  This is a very good DVD.  My only complaint and why it didn't get Five stars is they need to give more of a unified program that a beginner could do.  Instead of flipping from playground to playground with a bunch of different people.  Im looking forward to volume 2.  Keep the first guy that demonstrated the pullups througout the video in the next one and you have a winner.  He seemed to explain things the best.,1057622400,12,679,4.344
7973056,1,B00006SFLA,"this dvd is probably the funnniest workout video ever. the video basically consists of prison inmates just released from jail tearing off their shirts at ghetto playground to show off their bodies. (seriously) this exciting dvd teaches you how to perform pull ups and push ups.. just in case you never learned how to do them in third grade. spend 15 dollars on this dvd to learn! There is actually one guy in the dvd who doesnt do a complete push up, he goes halfway and pulls himself back up after 20 reps and is proud. impressive.
its actually a fun dvd to gather all your friends to watch, just to laugh at how ridiculous it is, and maybe play frisbee with the dvd afterwards.
its a funny attempt at something legitimate but cant be taken seriously because its just a bunch of ""tough guys"" showing off their body and cursing off the camera with the same rap song playing in the background over and over.
this is a perfect gift for any fake thugs in your area. a glorification of things most people would be embaressed about.",1043539200,29,1027,4.468085106382978
