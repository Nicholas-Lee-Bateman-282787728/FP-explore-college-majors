8121453,2,B000FEDRG0,"It's Almost totally stupid that three or four times (at approximately five minute intervals) the picture freezes and switches to a blue screen with white print reading ""FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY"".  Did VCI think we were going to ingest the DVD, or what?

The movie is Almost completely out of focus throughout.  Your typical extended play VHS has better picture quality.

It's Almost completely implausible that a man would leave Rosanna Arquette without telling her where he's going or what he's doing for whatever time it takes to rebuild and refurbish a broken down derelict of a restaurant.",1389139200,2,596,5.051020408163265
8121454,3,B000FEDRG0,"The Good: The film is a very quirky Australian piece with a very young Hugo Weaving. Loved seeing him and Bruce Spence! If you don't ask too many questions regarding the logic of the story, it is a fun little fantasy.

The Bad: The quality of the DVD was terrible. Grainy and washed out picture and, as mentioned before, the ""Screening Copy"" warning coming up constantly in the first part of the film.",1364860800,,401,4.493150684931507
8121455,2,B000FEDRG0,"Apparently the 2005 dvd release is poor as well. This 2008 one looks like a transfer from an extended play vhs.  Indeed, I have transfered things from extended play vhs that I recorded from tv that looks better.  There is also a notice that comes up a couple times ""this is a screening copy"".  We need a better release of this movie.",1364428800,,333,4.338709677419355
8121456,2,B000FEDRG0,"This movie is just great and nostalgic for some of us....Arquettes  and Weavings performances are just great in this sweet romantic comedy that won't be easily forgotten ....Anyways...I won't bother myself with writing too much details  because in the end I absolutely won't recommend it for the sake of a pervert ""Inc"" called ""Direct Source""...I mean the movie is totally remarkable ...but the quality is just way too unbearable...I just don't undestand how did those people found the guts to distribute some cult classic with a bad repulsive quality that kept me trying to determine the characters faces I mean the image is way too blurred... oh and the audio..it just keeps going and coming like a gentle visitor...this is just too depressing ...I guess that the price speaks for itself.....Please amazon ...clean your stock from this garbage.",1154649600,5,846,5.1231884057971016
8121457,2,B000FEDRG0,"Popular romance novels, in addition to American Westerns and private eye tales, are common fodder for millions of undemanding readers who are never strained by their favourites as they can simply open a book to any page and immediately be upon familiar territory.  Each of these genres is suitable for effective cinematic pastiche, and successful comedic examples of films in these classifications are not difficult to locate, but this Australian effort is certainly not one.  Wendie Walters (Rosanna Arquette) occupies a great deal of her time by reading romance novels, the origin of her fascination with this froth not surprisingly being an uninteresting marriage, in her case one of ten years to Ronnie (Bruce Spence), a route salesman for a cut-rate confectionery.  Her dreary existence is normally only enlivened by phantasies born of her reading, but since her tenth wedding anniversary is only a day away, she has planned something more realistic, a lavish meal for her and Ronnie to be held in their small flat, a candlelit feast that she worries may be more meaningful to her than to her spouse.  Indeed, apparently this is the fact, for Ronnie does not show up for the dinner, does not even come home at all, although a viewer knows the reason as we watch him driving through the Outback, following his sales route and suffering through a spate of vehicular mishaps that include overheating, a tire puncture, and a lightning strike that deposits a large tree limb in the path of his delivery van, thereby stranding him in Lizard Gully, population 2 (a crafty woman with her grown, and quite dim, son).  Sadly, Wendie knows nought of Ronnie's difficulties because his telephone calls have been intercepted by a jealous adversary of hers at their work office and, smarting from disappointment brought by her wasted anniversary celebratory attempt, she begins to believe that Ronnie is consorting with a ""floozie"", this serving only to strengthen the phantasy laden fabric of her generally banal existence.  This she does, largely by creating an ideal man in her mind with whom she may, without reserve, fall in love, named ""Jake"" or ""Randy"" (Hugo Weaving), a mindmade conceptualized swain who, in actuality, may exist, since Wendie's co-workers have spotted him driving her about in his European convertible.  This latter quartet of office girls is serving after a fashion of a Greek Chorus in support of her remarkable affair with Jake/Randy, since they are generally on scene, although one of them, Deidre (Kerry Walker - who wins the acting laurels here), discovers that Wendie has embezzled a thousand dollars from her employer's till to finance her escapist, and very well mounted, affair.  Meanwhile, back in Lizard Gully Ronnie, after being driven to shelter in an abandoned shack by a storm, recognizes that the decrepit building was once a small caf? and, tired of his dead-end job, he remains there, completely refurbishing the restaurant, now named ""Wendie's"", fulfilling his own phantasy of him and his wife having a fresh beginning there, inspired by memories from their past shared hopes ad idealistic plans.  When Ronnie finally returns to reclaim Wendie, he discovers a goodly amount of evidence that she has been dallying with another in his absence, but remains true to his design and drags her back to Lizard Gully to the restaurant that he has restored for them.  There is true professionalism to be found in the making of this foolish film, with top-flight designing, costumes, camerawork and sound processing; unfortunately, whatever may have been the work's original concept is lost, the scenario forming a barrier to any interest in a viewer stemming from continual shortcomings in logic and continuity.  This is yet another in a series of fey characterizations from the generally monochromatic Arquette, but she is ably joined here by a solid supporting cast and the two other principal players, all of whom do what they can with a script that is barely worth the effort.  Are Wendie's phantasies based upon actual incidents?...or are they simply created whole cloth and pulled from her imagination?  Unhappily, the screenplay wavers throughout upon these matters until, after silly surrealism and physical comedy have become prominent, a viewer merely wishes to go on to other things.",1146182400,,4319,5.109219858156028
