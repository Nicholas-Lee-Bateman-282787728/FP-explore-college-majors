5726530,1,B00CMDPT3Q,This documentary was done a long time ago.  If you know nothing about gansters I suppose it would be interesting.  I'd rather watch a ganster movie.,1388016000,4,148,4.653846153846154

5726532,5,B00CMDPT3Q,"This is a very well produced documentary; riveting, factual and excellent as far as the history it introduces the viewer to: a topic which many may have known only a small part of, or never knew about at all.

Lionheart Productions, known for their authentic re-enactment footage, provides some beautifully lit scenes and realistic dialogue as well as a top-notch narrator and very professional, ""character voices"" featured throughout the documentary.

For the price of under $12.00, in most cases, this is a documentary well worth the cost.

Future, historical documentaries made by this team, more which are under way, should be considered by those fans of well produced, factual and interesting documentaries.  The viewer is sure to be informed, educated, entertained and delighted, as is the case with: Gangster Empire: Rise of the Mob!",1377388800,16,840,5.246268656716418
5726533,4,B00CMDPT3Q,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series. The historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the original images and footage and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories to life.  Great for a fan of ""Boardwalk Empire"" and the worth of the real ORIGINAL gangsters.  Great historical background to this complicated and deadly era.",1374364800,8,532,5.034090909090909

5726539,4,B00CMDPT3Q,"Another Documentary about the ""Mob"" you say?  No Kidding?  Nope, no kidding!.  Once again Mill Creek Entertainment has delivered an excellent piece here.
  Pros: 1) delivered in 6 parts, so as not to rush the materiel.  2) Pretty accurate.  3) On Blu-Ray so there is enough space to present the material.  4) as usual, excellent price
  Cons: 1) Despite it being good...did we the public really need another documentary on the Mob?  2) While I LOVE blu-ray, just a DVD might done the trick.  3) despite thoroughness, it was dry
  Either way it was a good buy & interesting",1405123200,5,572,4.646464646464646
5726540,2,B00CMDPT3Q,"Having seen several of these cheaply made documentaries from Mill Creek and other budget labels, I kind of knew what I was in for.  Sadly this is probably one of the better ones simply due to the subject matter.  It's really the production values that drag it down to being mediocre.

But first I'd like to comment on the good.  Despite using much archival footage and excerpts from public domain films and such, the image quality was pretty decent by HD standards.  Even the worst kept stuff seemed to have an acceptable bitrate and digital compression artifacts are at a minimum.  They also deserve great credit for mostly sticking to high-resolution photos that are rendered well on an HD television.  I'm don't claim to be an expert, but it's been pointed out the facts are kept very accurate and plentiful.

Unfortunately there are probably TOO MANY facts, spouted out at a relentlessly boring pace.  Long stretches of monotone narration have very little to break up the tedium.  There are no interviews with historians or anything where an individual expresses opinion.  All of the employed voice talent is very dry and read directly off the page with little to no emotion.  To make this worse, much of the dialogue is poorly recorded and mixed.  This is a huge letdown given how good the picture quality is.  While much of the background music was appropriate, some of it seems like it was just randomly thrown in without any consideration to what was being covered.  At several points, selections from Holst's ""The Planets"" are used.  The Planets???? It's one of the most recognizable symphonies of all time and couldn't be any further off topic from organized crime.  And that's probably this documentary's biggest offense - going off on tangents with no relation to gangsters, mobs, prohibition, or crime in the least bit.  Starting off by covering the Boston Tea Party is a clue to just how far off-base it can wander.  The poor writing ostensibly killed it for me.

Perhaps I am spoiled.  I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Burns-Prohibition-Blu-ray/dp/B0052YDO3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Burns: Prohibition [Blu-ray</a>] and was thoroughly intrigued by this period in American history.  Ultimately, Ken Burns proves the difference a highly skilled documentary filmmaker (with much more money and resources) can make.  I suppose if you want cold hard facts and nothing else then Gangster Empire is for you.  But if your more interested in a telling of the human condition or incredible stories from an incredible time, then check out that excellent documentary or the equally acclaimed HBO series Boardwalk Empire.",1404604800,6,2686,5.236533957845433
