8590399,5,B000O77QVU,"Samantha Brown always does a great job with her travel videos (thanks!), and this one is one of my favorites.  Excellent interior/exterior footage, shot sequence, delivery and coverage of the Venetian; little has changed since '02 when this was filmed (except ""Venus"" club is now Tao's)... upbeat, fast-paced, thorough, great camera work.

The other Vegas ones in this series (Mandalay, Bellagio etc) are also good -- but this one's my favorite.  Excellent job, it captures the Venetian experience superbly, and Samantha does a superb job in walking us through the property.  Highly recommended.  Other notably good ones in this series are the Broadmoor, and the Disneyworld-FL property episodes.
