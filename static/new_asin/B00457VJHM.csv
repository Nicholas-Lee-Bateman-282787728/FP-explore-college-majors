4262640,5,B00457VJHM,This is Yolanda at her finest.  A well-paced 30 minute yoga practice that gives you a feeling of serenity as well as a fine whole-body workout.  I love this video ESPECIALLY for its deceptively simple but powerful focus on lower back and abdominal core strengthening.  This DVD expertly accomplishes the difficult task of blending the meditative with the physical practice of yoga.  I also love the guided-breath warm up at the beginning and relaxing sivasana (final resting pose) at the end.  Yolanda's encouraging style and smile makes you want to wake up and practice with her each day.  Thank you so much Yolanda for another wonderful practice DVD!,1299196800,8,652,4.9907407407407405
4262641,5,B00457VJHM,"I would have to say this should be the proper sequel to Yolanda's first DVD ""Simply Yoga."" I love that it was filmed in her studio. Beautiful, natural elements. And Yolanda's warm and welcoming smile in the beginning of the practice really sets the atmosphere. The new poses are a welcome addition to the standard array, not too simple, challenging enough to say you did something you've never done before! Bravo, Yolanda! Thank you for bringing us these wonderful DVDs with your gentle spirit.",1297987200,6,494,4.892857142857143
4262642,5,B00457VJHM,"For years I would try a work out DVD here and there and invariably put them away after only two or three attempts to get into them. I could follow some, others were impossible to keep up with or filmed in a confusing fashion, a few were pretty good but left me feeling merely sore for days and, in the end, I had no desire to spend weeks, months and much less years of my life with the various instructors. Everything changed when a snow storm forced me into a bookstore where I discovered Yolanda's first DVD, Simply Yoga. I've never looked back.

I now have a wonderful yoga instructor who I invite into my home through my DVD player 3 to 4 times a week and the changes in my body, my temperament, my energy level and, yes, my sex life, are incredible. I've been exercising regularly for nearly twenty years (since I was 29 years old) but only now does my body finally feel it's come into its own. Cardio, strengthening, stretching, centering... I'd heard a lot about the benefits of yoga but never found the right instructor. Now I own all three of Yolanda's DVDs and each one compliments the other one perfectly. I love them all but Yoga 2 Easy is my favorite because it flows from posture to posture without a break and really gets my heart rate going even as the relaxed yet steady pace centers and soothes me, making it a truly mind-body-spirit experience.

I had been struggling with symptoms of pre-menopause, hot flashes, diminished libido, the depressing idea that my body would never look as good as it used to, etc. After less than one year practicing yoga 3-4 times a week with Yolanda's superlavtive DVDs, the hot flashes are occasional and mild, my body is stronger, more toned yet also curvaceous, and feels more desirable and sensual than ever.

I highly recommend Yoga 2 Easy as well as Yolanda's first two DVD's, Simply Yoga and Yoga Easy. Her quiet yet precise instructions over the subtle background breathing track that accompanies and centers your own breaths through each posture, the setting, with its lovely colors and subliminal sense of running water, the sky-blue suit Yolanda wears that is both pleasing to look at and outlines each motion distinctly so you can see it clearly and more easily follow it, everything about the production is flawless and truly effective.",1289692800,17,2299,4.657635467980295
4262643,5,B00457VJHM,"Another fabulous Yoga DVD by Yolanda.  Again her usual 30 minutes format is just perfect, and it is easy, yet also  challenging at the same time.  The poses flow from one to the other and the pace is excellent.  I have her previous 2 DVDs, Simply Yoga and YogaEasy and now this one, and they are all very different in presentation and poses.  For me it's Yoga 'pure & simple' without the any of the Hollywood glitz.  Her calming, encouraging and nurturing voice (and great Australian accent) bring something very special to her unique teaching style.  After practicing to her DVDs I always have that great uplifted feeling and also feel that I have worked every muscle in my body.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MeditationEasy-with-Yolanda-Pettinato/dp/B002ASAFNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MeditationEasy with Yolanda Pettinato</a>",1286409600,10,876,5.904761904761905
4262644,5,B00457VJHM,"Yolanda Pettinato says: Do Your Best
These words give me confidence,I usually don't like to workout but I looked into yoga.
Yoga with Yolanda gave me more mobility and a feel good feeling all day. Probably due to the stretches and proper breathing. I really enjoy that the workout last 30 minutes and I can get my workout done before going to work. I have all 3 dvd's and enjoy them all very much.

8416571,5,B00457VJHM,I've had Yolanda's Simply Yoga video for several years and love it. I was looking to see if she had any new ones and I discovered this one. It's as good as the first one for me. I love seeing her growth and how much more gentle and softer she has become. The focus on this one is great b/c she does a lot with breathing in and holding in the belly ( a good thing) and love the prayer position after each asana. Excellent and I want more challenging ones now.,1445385600,,458,3.989130434782609
