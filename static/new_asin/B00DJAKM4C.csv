8593782,4,B00DJAKM4C,"Yes, it's narrated by L.N. himself, and yes, it's enjoyable and informative enough for a quick break while touring the observatory.  Its main focus is upon the history of the building and its mission, from why Griffith wanted it built to a detailed look at what it took to renovate and restore -- what was going on while it was closed to the public a few years ago.  You'll also learn about some of the exhibits inside, about the planetarium and -- perhaps inevitably for an L.A. landmark -- about its ""starring role"" on screens big and little through the decades.

While not the only film about the observatory on DVD (there's also an episode of ""Visiting"" with Huel Houser dedicated to the observatory), this is definitely the one for Trekies, as well as for those who want to understand how the institution came to be, and how those involved think about its place in the context of public astronomy in Southern California.

NOTE: In addition to being able to buy this DVD here, it is also available at the ""Stellar Emporium"" -- the Griffith Observatory giftshop.",1402704000,,1065,4.679144385026738
