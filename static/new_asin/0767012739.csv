7788643,3,0767012739,"I have owned this VHS set for over a decade now.  Not bad compared to other documentaries on people who arrived from Italy to the United States.  Has the usual ""Italian-American"" celebrity stereotypes.  A gem in the video is the footage of an anti-discrimination advertisement done by Frank Sinatra in his very early years.  And yet decades later Saturday Night Live would depict him as a racist.  Al Jolson popularized the whole ""black face"" thing in movies.  Then, decades later, Billy Crystal did it on (Where else?) Saturday Night Live and at the Academy Awards.  Frank Sinatra, a man of Sicilian ancestry, was trying to get across that that kind of stuff was not right.  Not only that, he was a strong, positive force in the Black Civil Rights movement in the 1960s.

To the person who commented about Italians ""integrating"" quickly like the Irish and their supposed multiple similiarities with the Irish:  Sorry, hate to burst your bubble, but the experience of Southern Italian and Sicilian immigrants has been much more like that of Mexican immigrants.  A few examples:  Being called ""greaseballs"", being suspected of having come ""illegally"" (""WOP"" stands for ""With-Out-Papers""), being discriminated against for having ""darker features"", having a similar Latin-based language, being the subjects of criminal-based paranoia, being known for dishes with tomato-based ""salsa"" (sauce) and foods that ""gli americani"" love and even having nearly the exact same flag, just to name a few.  Sorry, you lose.

Next up-to-bat:  The person who said ""assimilation"" was slow ""because of the language barrier"".  ""Assimilation""?  Into what, exactly? And, if anybody is familiar with the whole metaphor of the science-fiction collective entity of ""The Borg"", you know how creepy those people who believe and say that ""everyone must assimilate"" sound.

But hey, I realize that I am responding to very old comments.  So, hopefully those people have changed since then - for the better.

There are certain things in this video that haven't been featured in others on ""Italian-Americans"" or ""Italians in America"", whichever wording you prefer.  The part on the experiences of Italian-American soldiers being shipped over to none-other-than the country of origin of their own ancestors, their own famiglia, and the part on Sicilians in Louisiana are two examples.

But, crediting Nick La Rocca as the sole inventor of jazz music, or any single person or ethnic group, for that matter, is a step backwards.  Sicilian-Americans and African-Americans sometimes frequented and played in the same clubs in Lousiana.  It has been implied and said that they got along well down there during that time.  They got ideas from each other and neither one group can be credited as the ""sole inventors of jazz"", especially considering that jazz music has lots of other borrowings and mixings in instruments, language and musical styles from different cultures long before that era.  There also should have been more focus given to Louis Prima and Sam Butera, especially Louis, who is said to have been inspired by another Louis from New Orleans during his childhood - Louis Armstrong.  And indeed, those unfamiliar with Prima sometimes think that they are listening to Louis Armstrong.  Their voices were similar and each had his own style.

All-in-all, a better (and less-expensive) buy than some of the other ones, with information and clips you will not find on the other ones, as well.",1358553600,,3461,5.163375224416517

7788645,5,0767012739,"Very informative  video about the Italians that came to America and started a new life for them and their families. This VHS I didn't sell because it was so good. If you're Italian, you need to read this book. Whether you're young or old.",1221782400,,238,4.409090909090909
7788646,5,0767012739,I found this to be an excellent film. It contained all the information about the arrival and life of the Italian people once they were here - both good times and bad. All well done. I definately recomend it to anyone interested in an accurate and entertaining bit of history.,1154390400,3,275,4.52
7788647,5,0767012739,"Although I am an Irishman, I loved the fact how the video informed me on how Irish and Italians are the most integrated nationality in America. Their common bond with the Catholic Religion, toughness as a people, and  their willingness to fight for their rights.",936489600,16,262,4.822222222222222
7788648,4,0767012739,"Italians in America shows the real struggle that Itlo-Americans faced in this country from the first immigrants to today.  While the documentary promotes our great culture, our heroes in sports, film and the arts it gave  a pass to Hollywoods depiction (generally unfavorable) of Itlo-Americans.  It also failed to show the real bias that exists against Italian Americans  in some major cities with regards to politics.  I also would have hoped  that Chicago, which has the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame  and Taylor Street - which is heart of Italian Chicago - could have been  profiled.  This being said, the film was well done, well written and well  researched.",926640000,15,680,5.045045045045045
