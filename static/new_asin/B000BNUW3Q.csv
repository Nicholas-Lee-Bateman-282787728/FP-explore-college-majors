Martin has an insight, which no one else has, he is a genius, and being able to watch him on stage with this DVD is great and very motivating.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who has a brand and have not taken advantage incorporating the 5 senses into there brand, it will really show you what your missing out on, and how to fix it.",1136505600,,426,4.120481927710843
