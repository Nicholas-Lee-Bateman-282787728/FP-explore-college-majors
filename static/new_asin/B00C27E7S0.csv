There just slightly changed versions of sussecful action or scifi movies.

5686260,1,B00C27E7S0,"Started watching this mistaking it for Pacific Rim. This film stunk from the first scene. I've always liked Graham Green, but he even appears to be wooden. Our hero supposedly selected from all the top flight candidates to pilot a multi-billion dollar giant robot doesn't even have the self discipline to not duke it out with some guy on a cell phone that bumps into him on a sidewalk. After the first battle with a sea monster one of our other robo-jocks is helping a father look for his missing daughter (in a demolished hotel that our main hero just destroyed with a wild shot from his laser, but he moves around in a crouch with his weapon at low ready as he calls out the little girl's name. No wonder she stayed hiding. I couldn't take it any longer, unless we could get Crow and Servo and Gypsy to provide dialog. This is one to reserve for when you've got a couple friends around and want a laugh, but otherwise it's a waste of film.",1380499200,17,941,4.3522727272727275

This piece of mockbuster exploitation dreck, recommendable only for it's wooden acting, awful CGI, and awful plot, which all add up to a movie that quivers between the line of bad and bad-good...is a blatant ripoff of Guillermo Del Toro's hit monster movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Rim/dp/B00E3IZIM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Rim</a>.

Both films feature a washed-up pilot is forced to pilot a large robot to combat giant monsters that have been found in a portal beneath the ocean, but only ONE has the awesome action, brilliant visuals, spectacular fights, and great acting that a film like this deserves.

I'll let you guess which one it is, but let me give you a hint. It ain't Attack from Beneath...OR Atlantic Rim. Watch this only if you love bad-good, corny, cheesy, poorly-acted, mindless schlock. If not...avoid like the plague. The nasty Bubonic kind.",1378944000,10,960,5.706293706293707

I have no idea why it does not have a cult following ala Sharknado. I have never watched a movie with less continuity than Atlantic Rim. The acting, writing and CGI is so poor that it is hilarious. My 7-year-old son said, ""Dad, let's just watch it so see how bad it is."" We did and we did not regret it. Never have my sons and I laughed so hard than when we watched this movie.

5686273,3,B00C27E7S0,"I expected a B-movie and it was what I expected. Not too bad for a low budget flick. There were the usual continuity issues that Asylum is known for, fake fire, explosions that throw the actors around, but nothing surrounding is fazed by the blast, etc. Anyone expecting a top shelf film should be looking elsewhere. It had very little bad language and no nudity. There were scenes littered with bodies, etc., but its blatantly obvious this was fake to me. I don't understand why others judge these films against $50 million budget block buster extravaganzas, they are what they are and I was entertained by this one more so than some of the other Asylum films. If you think this was bad, watch the movie ""The Brain that wouldn't die"", which is better when spoofed by Mystery Science Theater. Or, ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" where the ""Gargon"" was a dead lobster waved around and the budget allowed 3 cars, and you will see what a really bad movie is. It wasn't as good as ""Dead Pool"" the low budget film that blew all the others away, but it wasn't that bad that I wanted my 90 minutes back or anything like after watching ""What Just Happened"". I spent a whole dollar at Red Box for ""What Just Happened"" and wanted my dollar and my 2 hours back....

The main plot was terrible, but it wasn't the movie. After watching me and my friends laughed about how stupid it was, but then we wondered. Why are all these people in town randomly dead with no building damage? Why did an EMT pull out a gun and refuse to treat someone? (Seen when the second monster attacks and the soldiers rush to the beach to shoot it) Why is fedex delivering after a disaster? (Seen before Red gets arrested) Then we realized. During the chaos the EMT killed people as a serial killer! After revealing his gun the scene cut. Then it cuts back later and the people are dead WITHOUT the monster reaching them yet. Earlier a fedex truck is driving away from the dead people! He takes on different roles to comit the murders! Rewatch and don't focus on the main plot.

The plot revolves around personal conflict to the point where they barely even cover fighting the monsters. I strongly suggest passing on this one.

I think you could put together a multi movie collection of Asylum's greatest hits and play it to a standing room only crowd at the North Korea Kim Jong Un Film Festival.

5686487,1,B00C27E7S0,"I watched less than ten minutes and had to quit it was so CHEAP.  From the trailer, I thought it was a straight to DVD sequel of Pacific Rim.  IT IS NOT!  Pacific Rim was not that great but I was curious about this movie.  It is a $5 counterfeit Rolex some street hustler tries to sell you in a back alley.

The movie starts on an oil rig.  It was not shot on an oil rig or anything that could be mistaken for an oil rig.  it was a simple platform just a little ways offshore.  The oil rig has an oil leak so they send a mini-sub down to investigate.  First, an oil rig would not use a manned sub but an ROV.  Also, based on the shots of the so-called oil rig, a guy with a pair of fins and a snorkel could have investigated the oil leak, it would not be that deep.  The interior of the mini-sub was shot on a HUGE, darkened soundstage with console in front of the two ""actresses"" sitting side by side with some electronic cabinets with lights behind them.  The camera had a tight focus on the actors to try to convey the tight confines of a mini-sub but you new that there were no walls off to the side outside the camera frame.  They were too cheap to build walls. There was no sense of the tight confines and claustrophobic conditions of a mini-sub.  Also, the electronics were out of place for a mini-sub.  It should have been metal and pipes and valves, not lights that the actors never interacted with or even looked at.  The acting was pretty poor.  The mini-sub was in danger and while the dialog portrayed it, the actors did not.  That is when I quit.  I could not stand it anymore.  The trailer looked like they spent some money of effects for the combat action and the exterior of the mini-sub was decent but they went so cheap on everything else.

I had not looked at the reviews before I started watching.  I should have.  I have now.  I cannot believe anyone would give this five stars.  I want to click the ""Report Abuse"" button on those reviews.  It is an abuse to say anything positive about this movie.",1484956800,,2020,4.181818181818182

No spoilers, but the story line was heavily borrowed from Pacific Rim, a movie I admit I liked. However this one did not have the budget (or talent) to even come close. The performances were extremely wooden, even from Graham Greene who I always enjoy watching, and the continuity was clearly not checked during post-production.

Normally, even with a bad movie I believe in sticking it out to the end before I consider writing a review, but even with all the patience and long-suffering I could muster, I couldn't even make it quite half way.  There's no way I'm going to bore you with a long list of what's wrong with this movie.  I'll just say two things:  Even with cgi, I've seen better special effects from old Dr. Who episodes.  And as an example of how bad this thing is, there is a scene where a one-eyed ...marine? ...walks up to an admiral and calls him ""general"", they get into a vehicle - which said individual is driving - and they have a conversation where the driver never once looks at the road.

For crying out loud, it was like they hunted up all the *worst* cliches from space movies and sword and sorcerer movies then really screwed them up and stuck them together with masking tape.",1475884800,,985,4.3791208791208796

5687257,1,B00C27E7S0,"Atlantic rim is the tragic story of good actors who fall on hard times, or at least thats what I took away from it.  You know there is something funny and ironic about good actors doing bad movies that become cult classics and I wish that were the case here, but alas here we have another asylum piece of garbage film ruining the memory of actors who I generally had liked before.
Atlantic rim is a shameless rip off of pacific rim, granted were not starting with filet minion here.  Asylum then took this film and ran over it with a truck, threw that in a blender, and then ate it and vomited it back up.  As if that wasn't enough they gave that to the girls from two girls one cup and said here you guys have a time and well be back in an hour for the results.  This movie had me wishing that I had firearms in the house.
The story if laughable and I think the budget was around 25 dollars.  It obviously wasn't very much because they only had the damn robots on screen for about 10 minutes of the whole show. This movie just plain stinks and thats too bad because as I said it had some descent actors.  Graham Greene from the green mile, dances with wolves and die hard with a vengeance (oh how the mighty have fallen).  Please give Costner a call and beg for any bit part you can get if this is the best Hollywood is offering you right now.
Along with him is a face I knew was familiar but not until IMDB told me did I know how, David Chokachi played the leader role in this crapfest, but youll probably know him as Jake from witchblade the short lived tv series.  A masterpiece compared to this dumpster fire. And then rounding out the cast is model  turned unsuccessful actress Jackie Moore who only provides eye candy and isn't even good at that, and finally a man who is only know for being famous by his wife, Mr. Pepa from salt n pepa, Anthony 'Treach' Criss.
These four put on over an hour of terrible acting from a script that should have been used as toilet paper or hamster cage liner or fire starter, anything but a script.  This move solidly deserves a puke and makes me wish I had watched a rerun of The Cobbler.

5687340,3,B00C27E7S0,"Biggest complaint - the script writers could not decide if the military involved was from the army side of the matter or the navy's side.
The milspeak kept changing!
PRIME EXAMPLE: Waters with his ""railroad tracks"" kept going from being referred to as Lt. Waters (that would be Navy/Coast Guard) to Captain Waters (which is Army/Air Force/Marines) and back again.

And the slang being used was the worst ad-hoc of milspeak and coast-to-coast civilian terms.

Next complaint - Graham Greene plays a US Navy Vice Admiral.
I really like Graham Greene, but he needed some help here.
Could they not find a single retired navy flag person of any variety to sit down and coach him at all?!?
Greene is a gifted actor, but he is lost in this role.
His acting chops gave him some gravitas thereby he is not completely swamped by the admiral's uniform. but ... .

Simply put, a military advisor or advisors were desperately needed in this picture and for far more than just to Mr. Greene.

Next - the alleged fighter pilot in what looked to be a helicopter simulator - maybe.
Moreover, the bomber pilot & co-pilot from an alleged B-2 Spirit; that cockpit should have been a real wiz-bang of a setting. but it was even worse than the fighter cockpit screw-up.

I could go on with complaints, but why?
I cannot make the picture any better than it is so why complain any further?

I had fun watching the picture, despite my winces, but I cannot recommend it to anyone.

5687387,3,B00C27E7S0,"What can I say.  The movie has its moments, but for the most part you can't look too closely at the movie.  Okay a quick synopsis of the movie.  Supposedly there are these huge dinosaurs like creatures that need oil and salt water to gestate their eggs making them get really big.  Our oil exploration has exposed them deep in the ground under the ocean.  The first one emerges and takes out an oil refinery.  We have this secret government project building these giant mechanical fighters.  We have three and a operator for each.  The show is about taking out three of these monsters.  I would say that the movie has a modest budget and they did the best that they could with the money that they had.  The acting in a lot of places is very amateurish.  They made really good use of stock footage and special effects.  There are sometimes that I just have to wonder about who wrote the script.  At the beginning you have two females piloting a deep sea diver and I thought they must have been piloting it remotely, as there is no way they have all this room in this sub.  They keep commenting about what creature they are seeing and how it shows up on the radar.  There seems to be no window inside the sub, looking at it outside there are, but inside it seems that they are looking at a monitor.  I also love how the first creature that attacks creates all of this damage.  I watched the fight scene, the creature never left the beach.  Then later you have one of the heroes going to rescue a young girl in a tavern.  On his way there the buildings are fine but there are dead people all over the place.  I was wondering how they died from the creature attack and yet the building are okay.  Even inside the tavern you have dead everywhere.  Later when the Admiral is supervising the cleanup of the damage there are destroyed building everywhere, yet the destruction is inconsistent with the creature attack and there are no dead bodies.  Then the brig that they lock up one of the pilots is a joke, it is like an oversized utility closet.  Just one final observation, I mean I could write pages of stuff that doesn't make sense or is not right, like how the radar screen never changes, but my last comment is how they are all three drinking, and we aren't talking beer, they are called into action and nobody has any alcohol impairment.",1473033600,2,2338,4.383720930232558

Atlantic Rim was such a film. I was kept awake by the necessity to shout frequent criticism of the bad acting or dialog  , and she was energized and drawn in to the film by my critiques. When it was over, we agreed that we were glad we watched it, bad as it might have been, because it kept us both awake and entertained.

5687491,1,B00C27E7S0,"OK, radio waves cannot be transmitted efficiently in deep ocean waters. That is because salt water is very conductive. Radio wave is a spectrum of electromagnetic wave. Transmitting electromagnetic wave in a conductive media, induces electric eddy electric currents, hence converting the wave into electricity. Therefore the wave strength would be absorbed by the ocean saltwater. The higher the frequency the worse the absorption.

So submarines have to use ultra low freq (below 10 Hz) to communicate effectively. Well, 10 Hz doesn't allow very fast communication, does it? But in this movie, the surface control personnel were communicating with the deep sea robot pilots like almost instantaneously and with so many words too.

The effortlessness invested in this inaccuracy is mirrored by the cheap screen play. It is like they don't care about how the audience is immersed into the movie. The actors are kept talking talking talking without bothering to induce a sense of reality into the audience. And worse, Graham Greene made to shoot off from his hip, a hardly believable southern US accent.",1472601600,,1101,5.25

rom the start, but the CGI is 6 feet below sub par, the script is so all over the place, that one can't follow the plot, or figure out if there is even one.
Jackie Moore is given nothing to work with (script wise) an as a result, creates a one dimensional character that is unpalatable.

5687708,2,B00C27E7S0,"At first this movie was excruciatingly painful to watch. I almost gave up, but when I made it to the twenty minute mark something miraculous happened. No, the movie didn't get any better (in fact, some of the worst parts were yet to come) but at twenty minutes my mind kicked into ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" defense mode, and the movie became hilariously funny. That's the only reason I give it two stars instead of one.

The actors who played the three robot operators gave horrible performances, and I couldn't decide whether the Blue rider or the Green rider was worse. Whenever the officer I nicknamed ""Angry Eye-patch Guy"" opened his mouth I would analyze his every expression (the fact that he was trying to be deadly serious made it even funnier). Not even Graham Greene was immune to the curse of this movie. I've liked Graham Greene ever since Dances with Wolves and Northern Exposure, and this was the worst job I've seen him do. To be fair, there were a couple of minutes toward the end of the movie when Graham Greene was tolerable, but by then the damage was done. There was one actor who almost gave a believable performance - the bespectacled captain of the USS Wasp; too bad he was red-shirted after only about 30 seconds on screen (or maybe it was one of those chicken vs egg things, and he was almost believable because he was only on screen for 30 seconds).

When it hit me that these people had been paid to do this movie, I couldn't stop laughing. However, the best was yet to come. About fifteen minutes before the end, the scientist informed the robot handlers about their melee weapons. When that giant red robot struck a pose with his color-coordinated battle-ax, I lost it. I had to pause the movie so that I could laugh it out, then I had to rewind it so that I could laugh some more.

I had read the reviews and I had watched the trailer, so I knew going in that this movie was a cheap knockoff of Pacific Rim, but I decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad I did, because for an hour and a half I got to pretend that I was as clever as Joel, Mike, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot. Whether it's the ridiculous dialogue, or the horrible acting, or the cheesy special effects, or the color-coordinated battle-axes and swords, or pantomime-challenged actors trying to pantomime wielding a weapon, or robot operators miraculously disembarking from their robots in the blink of an eye, or giant riderless robots standing tall in the middle of town, or (toward the end of the movie) the disappearing/reappearing/disappearing white blanket wrapped around the woman in the jeep, you too can exercise those MST3K mental muscles and be as clever as Crow.",1470528000,15,2669,4.579497907949791

Normally, I actually enjoy campy, sci-fi/horror movies like The Asylum is known for making.  This is the same studio known for its campy classics such as Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus, 2-Headed Shark Attack and Sharknado. No one would mistake these for ""real"" movies. They are clearly made to be mockeries of their big-budget counterparts. Their entertainment value lies in cheesy one-liners, comeback performances by washed-up actors and never taking the movies themselves too seriously. These are movies that you watch to laugh AT, not with.

That being said, Atlantic Rim is a movie completely devoid of the so-bad-its-good characteristics that The Asylum fans have come to expect. I get the impression that the actors in this movie are actually trying to take their roles seriously, which is the worst possible way you could approach such a crapfest of a script. Yes, they try, and they fail, quite miserably. Rather than a movie I can laugh out loud at, I ended up getting a series of cringe-worthy scenes that started making me feel embarrassed for all those involved, especially the cast members with no actual acting skills. The wrap party of this film must have been like attending a funeral.

There were no classic one-liners, no CGI scenes so ridiculous that I wasn't bent over in pain from laughing, no washed-up actors that I remember seeing before and no cheesy charm. This was simply a paint-by-the-numbers rip-off of an already horrible movie (Pacific Rim) that had no likable characters, no camp and no suspense. Think WaterWorld on a small budget.

You couldn't get me to watch this movie again with a welder's mask on, which would be the only humane way to to expose anyone to this horrible excuse for a film.",1449360000,,1977,4.960725075528701
5687744,2,B00C27E7S0,"It is what it is folks. If you are looking for a low budget sci-fi film with a few reasonably well known actors (that is a straight rip off of a successful film) then this is for you. The movie is not so horrible in the special effects department as opposed to the acting as it is in my opinion right in line with movies like Sharktopus, Swamp Shark and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus. I enjoyed this movie but the acting could have been better (I've seen better from extras in Godzilla movies)(thank you futurama!). If you have seen Pacific Rim then you can understand the desire to ride the bandwagon on something successful (Tombstone/Wyatt Earrp).

Sit back, relax and enjoy but don't worry if you step away for a snack, a bathroom break or a nap - you will not miss anything.",1440288000,,777,4.395833333333333

5687766,1,B00C27E7S0,"I love ""Pacific Rim,"" so, just for a laugh, I thought I'd watch this parody. This film is ridiculous - in all the bad ways. There are so many stereotypes - villain wearing an eyepatch, the ""lead"" guy is a hothead who gets chastised by his military commander, the ""obligatory"" extended walking toward the robots, a love triangle - and so much more. For a second I tried to apply logic to the storyline, like when ""all the bridges are tangled up in New York."" The onscreen image for that showed a not crowded, easy flow of traffic. There are more head scratching moments than anything humorous you would see in a parody. The computer effects look like a 3rd grader made them, there are no explanations for almost all the storylines (magic weapons that randomly appear? what?!). And the plot.... Gosh, where to being criticizing the abhorrent lack of one? At so many points, it's just stupid. Banging your head on the wall stupid. ""Oh, we could save hundreds of people, but we need to get our hotshot jerk of a leader out of a building, then we'll go save hundreds of people."" WHAT?! The casting was awful. I felt like I was watching a horribly poor Power Rangers episode. This movie makes the original Power Rangers look like total BAMFs. I could kick myself for renting this. Every robot/action movie stereotype was met and poorly overdone.

Also, I rarely call movies out for this, but ""Atlantic Rim"" is so stupidly misogynistic. Like, slapping fellow pilot/girlfriend on the butt before a mission. Really?! Did that HAVE to be in there? And the girls in bikinis on the beach, with long shots of their butts as they walk? The female pilot constantly having to be rescued by the men? At least ""Pacific Rim"" had a solid, strong, intelligent female lead and no sexualizing of women simply to be walking sex symbols!

Don't waste your time. Or money. Or brain. Or eyes. Or ears. Or any part of your life. This movie is NOT WORTH IT. If someone paid me to watch it, I would tell them to keep their money. Such a stupid, ridiculous, idiotic piece of crap.",1438732800,2,2049,4.565217391304348

5687780,2,B00C27E7S0,"If anyone knows Asylum films and watches this anyway, ya deserve what ya get.  Why did I watch it?  I figure it's because I'm out of touch with reality and believe that sooner or later Asylum might actually make a half-decent film.  The fact that I've been working all day and needed to just veg out probably also had something to do with it, and this is definitely a veg-out movie-- as in ""if it's Saturday afternoon, raining like a fiend outside and cable TV is out"" veg out.  If you have popcorn and chocolate they will be a redeeming factor.

I almost rated this three stars because I did enjoy the CGI on the monsters and robots.  We've seen far worse special effects and at least in that area, they were acceptably not-quite-lame.  We've also seen much worse acting out of Asylum films and majorly worse scripts.  This film was a romp and at least did not bore to death.  The brunette communications officer has a great smile.  The blonde costar is suitably shapely.  And one of the military guys is wearing an eye-patch.  What more can you ask for?

Senseless?  Of course.  Anyone watching a robot vs giant monsters flick and expecting it to make sense is in the wrong universe.  Bald-faced goofy?  Definitely.  Predictable? Oh yeah.  This is one of those films that I could tell you all the plot details and I wouldn't spoil the movie one bit.  Big monsters.  Robots to fight them. City ransacked.  Yadda yadda yadda.  It's been done before and better.

The film definitely jumps the megalodon.  Suffice it to say certain attributes of basic physics are thrown right out the window.  And people somehow exit 200-ft-tall battle robots almost instantly without any assistance whatsoever (one moment they're in the cockpit, the next moment on the ground).  Okay okay, never, ever expect a giant robot film to actually make sense.  But one thing I do insist on in a film is at least tying the main strings together before the end.  When one leaves plot lines open and unresolved that's when the 2-star rubber stamp comes out.

Having said that, the CGI was actually very good, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.",1525564800,,415,4.32051282051282

8576416,2,B00C27E7S0,"After reading all about this, I had to give it a try. It was better than the Incredible Bulk, but that doesn't make it great by any means. The acting of certain characters was just so terrible, I couldn't even pick one part where I said ""wow, she/he nailed it"". Other actors did well with most lines, but botched a few. Special effects weren't terrible, but were a far cry from where they could have been. This felt more like a power rangers episode than a Pacific Rim wanna-be movie. I would say, it is good to have on as background noise and worth glancing over when you hear an explosion, but if you have a few hours on a Saturday night and are looking for something to watch, you better think twice with this one.",1522540800,,717,4.279411764705882
8576417,1,B00C27E7S0,The first movie was good. What not enough money to make the 2nd. This is the cheapest looking movie I have ever seen. Bad actors and super fake looking environment. They made better movies in the 70s.,1522540800,,200,4.4324324324324325
