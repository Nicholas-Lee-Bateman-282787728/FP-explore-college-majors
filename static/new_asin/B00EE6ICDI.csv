5907022,5,B00EE6ICDI,"I loved the way the documentary was made. I appreciate the work that Zachary Levy did.

But the DVD was almost impossible to get through. I had to stop it several times. The main guy, Stanley...was unbearable to watch. His girlfriend (who used to be a true beauty) puts up with him, for some reason. But his petty jealousies and constant complaining, make him unsympathetic.

And Stanley; Strongmen don't get drunk before attempting their feats.
I'm a real fan of Old Time Strongmen. And Stanley is certainly strong. So I have to acknowledge that.",1422316800,2,547,4.808510638297872
5907023,4,B00EE6ICDI,"This is a very sad story in many respects.  Stan tries to be taken seriously as a strongman, but in the process comes across as selfish and tends to mistreat some of those close to him.  It would appear the filmmaker wanted to juxtapose the physical vigor of someone with emotional frailty, not only his own, but those of his family and girlfriend. For anybody interested in strongman, human interest, or sports psychology this is worth a watch.",1416355200,,445,4.6923076923076925
5907024,4,B00EE6ICDI,"Zachary Levy is to be commended for producing and directing this very poignant reach for fame in the gentle soul of one man, Stanley Pleskun  who uses the moniker `Stainless Steel'. A man with a dream of notoriety, our character is a man strong enough to bend a penny with just his fingers. When Stainless Steel reaches middle age, career disappointments and difficult personal relationships that begin to test his strengths - aging parents, his alcoholic brother, his beautiful but timid announcer-girlfriend, and his show-biz agents and strength rivals. All the while we honor a man who simply dreams and tries to overcome the role life has dealt him. This is a film that lingers in the heart and mind long after the closing credits.

5907025,5,B00EE6ICDI,"As a documentary, this film does not seem truly aware of the epic tragedy it has recorded with unblinking eye.

It is the emblematic story of one woman; she was an unbelievable beauty in her youth---a goddess---who no longer looks that way, but whose beauty is even greater than before, in an almost eternal, iconic, and divine manner. She is All Women; all long-suffering yet devoted true lovers of their greatly-flawed men. ""True,"" in the sense of purity as pure as only the finest women can be.

Barbara (last name never published) loves this great, raging, failed and failing lump of a half-superman, named Stanley, who does not deserve her. She is powerless to help as he deteriorates ignorantly over the years. This is to her own detriment yet elevates her to an almost incipient sainthood.

Stanley loves Barbara. He means no harm. Think: Ralph and Alice Kramden, but tragic.

This is a story shot over a four years that reveals Stanley's descent into a kind of personal hell, dragging the woman who loves him along down. He is a fading circus-like strongman can neither find the marketing key to showcase his unique powers, or halt his own failing abilities as they slip inevitably away into age. We watch his hair turn gray in four years, and his strength leaving him, assuredly as did Sansom's leave him, but never to return.

Worse, in his fanatical, blind struggle toward the one thing he feels will redeem his failed life---strength and force---he ignores, degrades, and destroys the truest love of maybe the only person on Earth who can save him and his soul from total, obliterating, self-waste.

We do not so much watch his stregnth and ability fade, as we do his constant drunken, maybe drug induced failure to recognize the intense, redeeming Love of the only woman---person---in the world who would value him more than her own life, and maybe resurrect his sanity and salvage his lost soul.

Horrified, we watch Barbara's open, selfless love devolve into confusion, fear, and---ultimately---terror.

Blazing moments of the cosmic disconnect between man and woman and what we are supposed to do with our limited time here, on this planet---Earth. How to connect with the Something Greater we all sense; how to do it though the humanity of Humanity; and, how to face death gracefully. These are part of the lessons taught in STRONGMAN.

If each man could have a woman like this one,  he could face anything.

I cried tears for Barbara; her tortured expression, sad eyes, and confusion. I watched Barbara and Stanley's original, sweet, burgeoning love affair suddenly plunge away to abuse, as Stanley loses his youth, powers, and last shots at personal glory. A gladiator who cannot win and who nobody will put out of his misery.

Stan---Barbara was your great loss in life. You're an ancient gladiator who never took the gladiator's oath. Also, I think your strength may not be from ""natural sources."" And I think this has interfered with your judgment awfully.

I wish Stan and Barbara the Best

See this flawed documentary that unravels a slashing, raw, true tragedy of man and woman everywhere.

5907026,2,B00EE6ICDI,"If you can sit through this movie, you either deserve a medal or your head is made of metal.

What a horribly slow and depressing film.  It follows an amateur strongman on his quest for notoriety.  Scene after scene of boring scenarios, sad occurrences, hopes you KNOW are going to be dashed, and the daily struggle of a good guy on hard times.

As I write this and reread my sentences, I regret that they may make the movie sound more interesting than it actually is.  To give you an example, if you enjoy watching old people feed pigeons or watching other people mow their lawns, you might like this movie.  Because most of it depicts dragging hours and slow days in the life of ""Stanless Steel.""

And here is where I feel I have to stand up for Stan.  He is a simple, well-meaning guy with big hopes and dreams.  Unfortunately, he really does not have the guidance or means to attain them.  I got the impression that this movie was made to sort of poke fun at Stan and exploit him.  Not help him.

Stan is a good guy who deserves to be part of a show of some sort.  He needs training and guidance, not to be ogled by millions of viewers.  Did the film makers make this film to feel better about themselves?  Maybe.  It seems cruel.

I love Stan.  He is a good Jersey boy with a lot of heart and a lot of strength.

Hate this movie.  I've been in doctors' waiting rooms that were lots more fun.",1390089600,3,1396,4.215909090909091
5907027,3,B00EE6ICDI,"It didn't take long for me to see this man and this movie wasn't going anywhere. I actually lived for several years, in the early 70's, in New Jersey,not far from Miltown  and South Brunswick in the town of Mattawan. Although I enjoyed my time there,I must admit that I can't recall anything of any great importance that happened while there, and other than the fact that Frank Sinatra from Hoboken,and Bruce Springstein, were the only ones  who ever made it big. I recall ,that every night for 2 hours , Jean Shepherd,of ""The Christmas Story ""fame,ran a talk show on Radio WOR New York. He never had much to say about New Jersey,but on one night I do remember him describing how ,when you leave New York,you come out of the tunnel amidst a landscape of derelict buildings,rust and junk everywhere ,and overhead is a huge sigh proclaiming ""Welcome To New Jersey  The Garden State"".
 So,it wasn't long into the movie that we learned that it was true and set in New Jersey.
  Acts of great strength and world class competitions were so few and far between that they didn't matter. Stanless Steel,seemed to be possessed with great strength,but there was little to show it. As to a personality that could be exploited for greatness;he didn't have any,and neither did any of those around him. That didn't seem to bother any of them ,but I guess they hoped somehow,greatness would just fall in their laps. All through the movie,I kept wishing that some greatness would come to Stanless,but it never did. In the end,one cannot feel sad for Stanless ,or the others,as none of them had any great dreams or burning ambition and they all fit the expression of ""Having wish bones where they needed backbones"" ..both were missing here.
I assume the same sign announces the entrance into New Jersey"" unless by some miracle its replacement by,""Welcome To Jew Jersey"" Home of World Champion Strongman,Stanless Steel"" is being pondered;but somehow ,I doubt it.",1389744000,,1943,4.785074626865671
5907028,5,B00EE6ICDI,"i love this! strongman is quite simply a great movie. It's a true documentary, faithful to the tradition of the first documentary filmmakers.  Thus, Strongman comes with no preconceived agenda. Rather, with a seemingly infinite patience and tenacity that matches his subject's, Zach Levy records one man's life as it happens, letting Stan's story unfold. And as we watch, increasingly enthralled, we see that we are watching a quest story, in which a seemingly ordinary and likable guy with a unique but totally unvalued gift continues, with stubborn integrity, on the lonely road of striving  to perfect that gift. Stan's always aware of the ever present possibility  that the world will never recognize his achievement. In the process, what emerges too is an moving exploration of what it means to be a strong guy in our society, holding up not only a truck  but a chaotic family. Finally, i'm pretty sure that such a sensitive filmmaker must have seen the connection between his film (will it be seen and its gifts recognized?) and Stan's brave trajectory.",1385596800,5,1059,5.0
