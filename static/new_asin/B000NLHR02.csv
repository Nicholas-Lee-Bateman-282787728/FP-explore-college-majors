8179212,1,B000NLHR02,"There's a small amount of good information in this DVD, but it's certainly not worth the asking price.  You can get all the same information in the HVX200 manual or online.  For free.

And the production values are poor.  The host sits in front of the camera and meanders on about various unrelated subjects before getting to the stuff we bought the DVD for.  It is exactly 55 minutes and 44 seconds into the program before he actually turns on the camera and shows you how to move footage into FCP!  I was astonished at the lack of editing and the poor quality of the presentation.

If they charged only $10, then this might be worth it. But they don't, so save your money. Especially since you have to sit through nearly an hour of the host babbling about the difference between an ENG camera and HVX200, and similar such ravings.",1216771200,2,832,4.470198675496689
8179213,2,B000NLHR02,"Noah is the best at what he does but this video is lacking in the content area. If you have spent $2000 -$3000
 on a dvx100  you probably already have done the research as to what this camera can do (if you have not there is no excuse) 2nd If you have Final cut pro 5 you spent any where from $600 on ebay to $1200 at the apple site. Which means you already know what FCP does and are probably really well versed in the software.
If thats the case don't spend $75 on this dvd. you already know every thing that Noah says here. If you are an absolute fresh out of the box beginner  that just spent $5000 on a bunch of camera and edit hardware (what are the chances of that) then the dvd is for you.",1191196800,8,697,3.9290780141843973
8179214,5,B000NLHR02,Noah knows this camera and the post-production workflow inside and out.  Save yourself a lot of grief and lost time and get this BEFORE you start shooting.  You'll be glad you did.,1171843200,,180,4.59375
