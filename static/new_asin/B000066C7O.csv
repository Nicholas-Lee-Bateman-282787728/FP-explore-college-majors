8140497,1,B000066C7O,"I am an absolute beginner to the clarinet, so I bought this DVD and happily started watching everything from how to remove it from it's case, put it together, and play my first note.
So far so good, then I get to the part where they teach me actual notes......and there are no fingering charts! Even watching really carefully I couldn't tell which of the little silver keys were going down as she called them different names.  There was no material that named the keys, no charts to show fingering, nothing.  All I could grasp from the DVD were the basic notes that covered the big holes.  How hard would it have been for the company to have a little handout on fingering charts in the DVD box!
The DVD can also be put in the computer to download info.  So, I thought, here are my fingering charts.  Nope, some worthless info about notes, but nothing to do with a clarinet.
I have now ordered some more beginner books and have downloaded fingering charts off the internet......so much for the ultimate guide.  Don't waste your money.",1053561600,37,1033,4.526881720430108
