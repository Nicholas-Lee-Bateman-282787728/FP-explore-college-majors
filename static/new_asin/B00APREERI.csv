8555809,5,B00APREERI,This movies Title is an understatement. Wicked Women is superb viewing for an audience who remembers women before the introduction of waxing. The plot is worth the suspense.,1411689600,6,173,5.214285714285714
8555810,1,B00APREERI,"Really bad and support his reputation. Plot, if any, standard without any imagination. Rating 18 not supported by any means.
Chicks pretty hot but main character Lina Romay looks like she spent  too much time in coffin. I guess Jess Franco plainly not capable  of  developing story. Some of the moments are from Voodoo Passion which doesn't add much for positive review. Avoid.",1406505600,3,377,4.9523809523809526
8555811,3,B00APREERI,"When a director states (as Jess Franco does in an interview on this disc's extras section) that he has helmed over 200 movies - it almost goes without saying that not all of them are going to be 'gems'. After viewing ""Wicked Women"" my feeling was that it belongs in the 'filler' category of Franco's lexicon of sexploitational directorial brilliance.. Ever a fan of the lucrative 'women in prison' themed plot-line - Franco takes a slight detour with this film and shifts to a 'women in the mental institution' hybrid with a quite convoluted plot line to navigate. Following an opening frame of a 'shocking' double murder the 'first responders' come upon a survivor at the scene - a cringing, naked Lina Romay who is babbling incoherently in a state of shock and must be whisked away to a mental institution for observation until she can, hopefully, regain her faculties and act as a proper witness in helping to solve the crime. Should we be surprised that the mental hospital seems to have only attractive, scantily clad female patients in its' wards?! The staff of the institute set about trying to help Lina regain her memory - but they have an ulterior motive! - apparently the murdered couple were diamond smugglers and everyone thinks that Lina is the key to finding the missing jewels & solving the murder mystery. Suffice it to say, that as the plot unfolds, there are yet more mysterious murders and a lot of girls running around naked and having lesbic liaisons until all is finally revealed & resolved in a 'startling conclusion'.

For those that are familiar with Franco's 'style' there are few 'surprises' here. His usual camera moves and rather choppy editing manage to suck much of the energy out of the potential for excitement that the material might have. We are, par usual, left with the gratuitous nudity and sex scenes to base an opinion upon, and there are plenty of both of the aforementioned in evidence. The bevy of female inmates have the usual array of 'quirks' to distinguish them and they spend a lot of time lolling about nude on their beds. All of the hospital staff join in the sexual frolics too - bedding either one another or commingling with the patients. All sex scenes are definitely 'soft core' and this flik is generally less explicit than some of Franco's other works. Lina Romay sports a couple of different hair styles throughout - she starts off with a 'cute' short bob type haircut, but once she's in the asylum she gets a boyish brush cut that gives her sort of a 'butch' look that I personally didn't find particularly appealing. I don't know if this was perhaps the first time that Lina adopted this ultra short-haired look - but it IS the hair style that she apparently favors - right up to the present day.

My ultimate take on this flick is that it is a bit over-priced for what you get. I think that the box cover art (one of the best things about the package) is actually lifted from another Franco/Romay effort: ""Rolls Royce Baby' and makes LIna look way hotter than she actually comes off in ""Wicked Women"". The quality of the DVD transfer is nice and sharp (widescreen) - the English sub-titles over the German language audio are a little clunky - there is an xlnt musical score. Some decent 'extras' are included on the disk - mostly advertising other films available in the 'Jesse Franco Collection"". It is good to have more of Franco's films being made available on DVD - but this relatively recent access to many of his works is also tending to show that his directorial 'brilliance' was often rather lack-lustre. Still - lotsa naked sex scenes & attractive girlz make this more watchable than much similar fare.

Please note that this is a European Region 2 PAL disk and requires a 'region free' DVD player to watch it.",1397692800,3,3781,4.6656671664167915
