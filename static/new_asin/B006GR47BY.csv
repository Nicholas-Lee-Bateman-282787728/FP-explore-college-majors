8497728,4,B006GR47BY,Hadn't ever heard of these guys until I happened to hear one of their songs at the end of a Jim Jefferies comedy DVD. Looked them up and figured I would give this a shot. They play good straight up AC DC type rock with tongue in cheek lyrics and stage banter. The sound and picture quality isn't up to today's HD standards but it was recorded in 2005 so it's still pretty good. I will probably be getting some of their CDs because the music is catchy and clever.,1413590400,2,462,4.144444444444445
