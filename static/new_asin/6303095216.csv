562197,4,6303095216,I read in THE 70MM NEWSLETTER that FOX has struck a new TODD-AO print of DOCTOR DOLITTLE. I saw it when it first came out in 1967 and the TODD-AO image was spectacular.  It would be nice to see a new 70mm dvd transfer instead of the current 35mm print that is on dvd now. Fox did a great job with their TODD-AO dvd of HELLO DOLLY.,1123718400,,330,3.925373134328358

562199,5,6303095216,"The only thing that would make this movie a bit better would be if they would come out with an anniversary edition with ALL the scenes put back in.  The release of this has cut out several songs and scenes which creates gaps in the story line.  For those of us who grew up loving this movie, it is sad to see them cut it up.  The original soundtrack keeps all the songs, ""Something In Your Smile"" which is when he realizes he loves Emma Fairfax, instead he awakens the next morning on the beach and off he goes.  Terrible they cut it.  Wish they would put out the anniversary edition UNCUT and with Deleted Scenes back in.  Other than that, a timeless classic which does not get enough credit, specifically after Eddie Murphy ruined the overal charm of it.",1118361600,8,756,4.364285714285714
562200,3,6303095216,"A movie called Dr. Dolittle and His Animals came out in 1928, but the story didn't take off cinematically till Rex Harrison played Dr. Dolittle, the English country veterinarian who can not only speak 498 different animal languages (taught to him by his pet parrot), he can also carry a mean tune and proves it by breaking into song very often. Singing and winging his way to the South Seas, he means to find the elusive Great Pink Sea Snail and the Giant Lunar Moth (flanked by sidekicks Anthony Newly and Samantha Eggar).

Charming, despite its too-numerous musical numbers and ultimately absurd, aimless plot.

562201,5,6303095216,"What were you thinking? I'll admit the 1998 remake was entertaining, the way ""Wings"" is at one o'clock in the morning when nothing else is on, but, like ""The Nutty Professor"" Murphy's kid-friendly remake looks like a crime against cinema when placed next to its source material. First off, this is a musical with a beautiful score by Leslie Bricusse (who wrote the songs for ""Willy Wonka"" and ""Stop the World, I Want To Get Off"" with longtime partner Anthony Newley, who stars in this film). Also, Rex Harrison WORKED to learn to talk to animals. It wasn't a magical power he was born with, the man studied! He doesn't need cheesy (if well-cast) celebrity voiceovers and computer-generated  mouth-movement to convince us, either. So if you want your kids to settle for second best and, as a result, drag you to mediocre kiddy-fair after mediocre kiddy-fair (which, in the age of ""The Cat in the Hat"" is pretty bad) let 'em have Eddie Murphy. But if you want your kids to have taste and appreciate a quality piece of filmmaking, rent this film immediately. Even if you have no kids, buy it, rent it, whatever.",1086652800,112,1108,4.682051282051282
562202,5,6303095216,I highly recommend this film for people of all ages  It's a great film for the entire family to watch.  Rex Harrison is absolutly brilliant as Doctor Dolittle. He's a wonderful actor in every film that he does.  It deserves all the stars it can get.  It's well worth the price and a film I never tire of watching.,1032480000,7,313,4.254237288135593
562203,5,6303095216,"It was, in actually, the tiny village of Castle Combe, England, roughly 5 miles to the northeast of Bath  [...]  Did you know that Sea Star Island was actually the Caribbean island of Santa Lucia and that the great doctor came about because its author, caught in the throws of World War I, was having a difficult time  communicating with his family back in England because of wartime censorship, ""I do not understand the human race...It has no compassion for creatures with a different face.""
Read all about the whole movie here:  [...]
This movie was very beautiful, and deep, and just plain wonderful, and we all know it!
I grew up in that wonderful era of ""Willy Wonka"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" where Life was beautiful and you couldn't wait to get to the movies to see Samantha Eggar sing across the sunny, green English countryside, ""Here I stand at the crossroads of Life"" and you wished that your family could live in a windmill or could jump into a chalk drawing on a lazy summer's afternoon.  Those movies were that beautiful!
Haven't you ever felt like singing, ""After today...nothing will be the same again!  After today, I'll say, oh what a day it's been!"" or longed to chase the great Luna Moth or sail the earth in your own magnificent boat complete with...geraniums?  Am I the only one?
Couldn't it all be that beautiful?  This film is THAT beautiful!
""Let's hope and pray, that is the way!  The Life we love will always stay!  For my friend the Doctor!  My friend the Doctor and me!""",998265600,5,1504,4.574626865671642

The photography  is outstanding (shot in TODD-AO 70MM) and the orchestrations and songs  sound great! The Laser Disc was the only way to experience this oustanding  family musical...until now. Sadly, though, two of the films best songs,  ""Where Are The Words"" and the beautiful ""Something In Your  Smile"" were cut from the film right before its release and are not  restored here as hoped; be sure to check them out on the soundtrack,  available on CD (you can hear the melodies play in the overture, opening  credits, and exit music). Still, this is a great looking, great sounding  musical for everyone! Many muusicals of the late Sixties were unfairly  compared (or indeed did try to emulate) ""The Sound of Music"" and  ""Mary Poppins"" As time has gone on, they can be finally  apprecaited as the outstanding entertainments some of them are, like DOCTOR  DOLITTLE.",968112000,56,994,4.845238095238095

562468,4,6303095216,"A little historic context on this one.  Released in 1967, considered a critical bomb and a box office underperformer.  Twentieth Century Fox was known for these big budget affairs that went bust like this, ""Cleopatra"", and ""Hello, Dolly"" in the Sixties.  Big money Oscar push leading to what many felt was an undeserved nomination for Best Picture only added to its notoriety.  Time has been relatively kind to ""Doctor Dolittle"".  Rex Harrison is fairly charismatic and jovial as the kindly veterinarian.  Delivers requisite songs in that talking style that won him an Oscar for ""My Fair Lady"".  Anthony Newley barely convincing as Irish fish monger but agreeable enough.  For those in the know Newley was an inspiration to the early David Bowie.  Listen to Newley here and then turn on the ""Ziggy Stardust"" album.  Samantha Eggar, nominated for an Oscar a few years before for ""The Collector"", isn't really given much to do.  Real surprise is Richard Attenborough who proves to be a spry song-and-dance man.  Animal wrangling and training is pretty impressive providing a certain how-did-they-do-that quality to the affair.  My gripe with the picture is it runs a mite too long.  Kiddie pictures should not have a running time of two and one-half hours.  After a while attention spans wane even with the most resolute adult viewers.  Regardless, a lot of fun and light years better than those cynical Eddie Murphy remakes.",1514073600,,1423,5.017094017094017

562929,4,6303095216,"20th Century Foxs folly, four years in the making, vastly over budget, plagued by sick animals (they killed a giraffe) and a feuding Harrison VS Newley.  A $4.5 million lawsuit was leveled against them over a line of dialog mentioned in Bricusses script that he borrowed from another writer.  Harrison was difficult to work with, at one point they hired Christopher Plummer to replace him, and when they finally agreed to stick with the difficult Harrison they were also contractually obliged to pay Plummer his salary so hed leave.  20th Century Fox wanted Lerner & Loewe to write the music but Loewe had retired.  So they hired then fired Alan Jay Lerner to write the script.  Then they wanted the Sherman Brothers but they were under contract to Disney.  Leslie Bricusse was the best they could get at such short notice.  Harrison wanted Lerner instead.  Demands flew fast and furious; that this movie was ever made was a miracle.  But it was a box office dud.  Audiences in 1967 HATED it so they kept cutting it down trying to find an audience that would hate it less.  To try and recoup their loss, 20th Century Fox lobbied heavily for Oscar nominations, hoping that would help.  The film was nominated for nine Oscars, winning two (special effects and song).

The music is mostly forgettable, the plot is slow, the direction is uninspired, yet in spite of all that, I find that I quite like this mess.  Then too, it features the incomparable Geoffrey Holder as William Shakespeare X.

The acting is awful, the songs are excruciating (with the notable exception of 'I've Never Seen Anything Like It' which was performed, with gusto, by Richard Attenborough, who looked like the only person in the whole film who was enjoying himself), the special effects were rather clunky (and I remember thinking that when I saw the thing as a lad back in '67), and you develop no sympathy for or connection with any of the characters.

564461,5,6303095216,This is one of the classics everyone should watch.  As Dr. Doolittle explores the world of animals you get thrown into a world that is not only fanciful but beautiful as well.,1423872000,,175,4.46875
564462,4,6303095216,"In 1967 there was an epic movie called Doctor Dolittle starring Rex Harrison as John Dolittle, an animal doctor (they never really use the term veterinarian, do they?) who has decided that human beings are too complicated and endeavors to learn the spoken (mostly) language of all animals with the help of his parrot Polynesia, in order to better understand them.  One day fishmonger Matthew Muggins (Anthony Newley)  takes his young friend Tommy Stubbins (William Dix) over to meet the good Doctor and his growing menagerie of animals where Dolittle explains his story of how his animals got in the way of his former human medical practice and prompted his sister (and housekeeper) to leave.  While treating a horse Dolittle's lack of empathy for human beings offends the horse's owner, General Bellows (Peter Bull) and draws fire from the General's niece, Emma Fairfax (Samantha Eggar) for his general rudeness towards her uncle.  Mattthew become enamored over Emma.  Then a friend of Doolittle's send him a two-headed llama-like creature called a Pushmi-Pullyu which the Doctor takes to a nearby circus where the amazing animal becomes the star attraction.  Meanwhile the good Doctor befriends a circus seal named Sofie, who longs to join her husband at the North Pole.  The two make their escape, with Dolittle disguising Sofie in woman's clothes.  He is observed throwing Sofie into the ocean, mistakenly thinking she is a woman, and put on trial for murder with General Bellows presiding as magistrate.  He is acquitted but remanded to an insane  asylum.  He is freed by his friends.  Dolittle, Matthew, Tommy, Polynesia and crew debark on an adventure to seek out the Great Pink Sea Snail.  Emma stows away.  The adventure begins as do the mishaps.  I've said too much.  This is one of those movies, made in the 60s when Hollywood still had faith in acting and CGI was far off in the future.  It is warm and funny and genuine,  There is a delight that this movie will invoke.  Definitely worth the watch.  show it to your children.  Love it.  Cherish it.  There is a short list of movies that should be appreciated and this is one of them.  No Eddie Murphy tripe.  Just great filmmaking.

I seen ""Dr. Dolittle"" recently on DVD and also on VHS and found the movie charming and enjoyable.  Rex Harrison, Samantha Eggar, and Anthony Newley all give good performances as they all search for the Great Sea Snail.  The movie seems to be composed of several stories beginning with Dr. Dolittle's medical practice,  continuing with the Circus, and then the voyage to find the Great Sea Snail.  It is a sweet and charming movie without the violence, gore, and explicit language which seem accompany the newer movies.  It has some great songs, including ""Talk to the Animals"" and some songs that are average, however the good out weigh the average.

I'm not saying that it deserved it, for the film is quite silly and isn't really all that `classic' despite being enjoyable throughout, but the sheer fact that this film beat out the likes of `Far from the Maddening Crowd' or `Cool Hand Luke' for this particularly coveted nomination is just hilariously awesome.

This fun family film is vastly different than the 1998 remake starring Eddie Murphy (which I'll also admit to being a guilty pleasure of mine despite being inferior to this one) and it feels very much in toe with the general flow of children's films of the time.  It reminds me a tad of `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', just not as memorable or as admirable.  Still, this musical has a sharpness (stunning technical aspects) and such clever performances that are sure to keep you entertained.  The silliness of the plot reaches levels that only a true kid (or kid-at-heart) could rally behind, but at the end of the day there is no shame in indulging in a film like this with the family, especially since they really don't make them like they used to anymore!",1379980800,2,1158,4.601941747572815

His character is a well educated and travelled animal physician which is just as likely to tell a tall tale as he is to amaze with his adventures and travels. The plotline is juvenile and simple, and the movie is a bit long in the writer's efforts to set the stage for an amazing getaway to a somewhat corny make-believe land.

566224,5,6303095216,"Not to be confused with the Eddie Murphy comedy, which apparently took the premise of Hugh Lofting's classic children's books and left the remainder behind, this Rex Harrison film was adapted directly from the books by the composer/lyricist Leslie Bricusse (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Scrooge) and produced on a very grand scale.

Costarring Anthony Newley and Samantha Eggar (""my eyes are green, my hair is auburn and my dress is vivid red""), the epic spectacular was filmed on numerous breathtaking locations, including Tobago for the last sequence, and featured a score that yielded the Oscar winning ""Talk to the Animals."" An Oscar also was given for special effects, which were impressive in their pre-CG day. It was even nominated for best picture.

Also of note is Sir Richard ""Jurassic"" Attenborough (with Wizard of Oz-like putty nose) as the circus owner in a very elaborate musical number that included Disney entertainment executive Gene Columbus in the cast. Oh, and in case Samantha Eggar's singing sounds like Charlie Bucket's mom, it's because that's Diana Lee you're hearing.

What I remember is that the music from Doctor Dolittle was recorded by numerous artists in the late '60s, from Sammy Davis, Jr. and Bobby Darin to Alvin and the Chipmunks. The problem was that, while Fox was clearly expecting a Mary Poppins/Sound of Music success, Dolittle did little at the box office largely because audiences were tiring of three-hour musical extravaganzas, Hollywood movies were getting grittier and popular music was getting groovier. Still, taken on its own, this lavish experience stands up very well today as Disneyesque family fun.",1271635200,3,1662,5.217228464419476
566225,3,6303095216,"""Doctor Dolittle"" is one of those fun movies that kids and their parents can enjoy together, and it's a picture that people will want to watch again and again.

It follows the adventures of a man who can talk to animals.  Dr. John Dolittle was an unhappy people doctor when he realizes his calling as a very happy animal doctor.  Thanks to the help from his 188 year old parrot Polynesia the doctor learns the languages of animals and then proceeds to set up a veterinarian clinic in his home where scores of animals ... domesticated and wild ... come to him ... of their own accord ... to complain about their various ailments and then to be cured, always, by the good doctor.

As a result of some bad luck and a magistrate (judge) who seems to have a personal vendetta against the him, the doctor is, because of his talking to animals, deemed to be insane and is committed to an asylum.  Not to worry though as the doctor's faithful parrot Polynesia orchestrates a jail break.  Doctor Dolittle, his friend Matthew, Matthew's young friend Thomas, and a lady friend Emma then board the doctor's sailing ship and make good their escape from the law.

Being at sea allows the doctor to pursue the one overriding passion in his life: To find ... and talk to ... the legendary giant pink sea snail.  This quest produces some fun, but it also gets our little crew into some trouble.  The ending of the movie is, however, a happy and satisfying one.

If ""Doctor Dolittle"" is so good, why only 3 stars?  Well, it's a solid piece of entertainment.  It takes a great movie idea and fills it with good acting, good special effects, and songs and dancing that are mostly delightful and fun, but the writing is a culprit here.  It lets us down.

It's good writing ... most of the time ... but it goes off course here and there and we are given scenes and dialogue (not the fantastic scenes and dialogue ... which are fun ... but the human nature type ones) that are hard to buy into, that is to say, hard to believe would ever happen.

Rex Harrison plays the articulate, urbane, and unflappable Doctor Dolittle, and he is his usual excellent self.  Anthony Newley plays the doctor's friend and admirer Matthew, and he is a lot of fun as the wise-cracking Irishman.  I love that quick-witted Irish sense of humor.  Peter Bull plays the tag along boy ... the innocent youth of the movie.  And Samantha Eggar starved herself to play Emma, and she does OK, but her character is not easy to like.

I don't know why movie makers do that, but they often make the female lead character be mean.  Maybe they believe it will appeal to the women in the audience, but, whatever the reason, they do it here in ""Doctor Dolittle"" and it is hard to take and makes no sense at all.

The special effects in ""Doctor Dolittle"" work very well.  It's hard to figure out how they are done and, for 1967, that's pretty good special effects work.

But there is a lot of fun to be had watching ""Doctor Dolittle.""  It's a movie to be kept up front on the movie shelf so it can be easily gotten to.",1260835200,8,3058,4.398576512455516

As far as it bombing in the box office, I suspect that one of he reason is that the meat eaters that are so called ""animal lovers"" did not like being reminded that they are hypocrites!  I have seen very badly done children's movies with very bad acting and scripts that got better reviews than this, but they did not offend the Meat growers or cow and pig killers.

Even meat eaters do not like to be reminded that that steak or coat was someone's mother or brother! How many people would eat steak, chicken, pig or lamb if they had to go out slit it's throat, skin it and then cook it!  Not many.  But a piece of meat has no identity!

So it no doubt made lots of people mad.

Yes, by the way I have been a vegetarian most of my life (my first day on my own), and Dr Doolittle was part of my motivation.

I tell kids that ask ""Animals are my friends and I do not eat my friends"".  Most kids understand that, most adults just give me a bad look.

The effects were very good for the day and even now.  The story was good thought not what a meat eater and animal killer would like.

I was a children's movie.  I have it on DVD and still enjoy it.

The remake had no guts.  If you could understand and talk to animals like the new movies would you eat ""your friends"".  No but that was not mentioned in the new movies.  No guts they did not want to offend the beef industry!",1257120000,2,1548,3.9482200647249193

566483,3,6303095216,"It was good to meet 'Doctor Doolittle' again after forty years, a typical 'roadshow' musical film of its day and one which did not deserve the fate it received when it was first shown. Generally speaking, however, the structure of successful stage shows ('My Fair Lady', 'Oliver', 'Hello Dolly' etc), lent themselves better to lengthy screen adaptation than the 'original' movie musicals of the period of which this is a good example - another being the even more ill-fated 'Star!'. 'Dr Dolittle' would have been more effective shorter, without an interval and quite so many sentimental songs.

The acting from Rex Harrison and company is good and production qualities are terrific: beautiful settings, special effects and period costumes which make the most of the wide screen, whilst the artwork for the opening credits is delightful. Leslie Bricusse's catchy tunes and clever lyrics stand up well and are on a different level to his book which lacks shape and wit and only intermittently takes off - one is too aware of the padding. Only the eponymous doctor himself is developed as a well-rounded character and, even then, the part simply asks Rex Harrison to reprise his Professor Higgins persona, albeit with a softer heart. It is hard to accept his 'romance' with the ravishing Samantha Eggar, looking forty years his junior, who gamely tries to breathe life into Emma Fairfax.

Anthony Newley is rather wasted, but nasally  belts his numbers as if they are all hits - which, admittedly one or two almost became. Richard Attenborough brings some much needed vitality into the picture with his incredulous Circus owner and there is a nice cameo from Peter Bull as an unpleasant JP. All the animals are appropriately cute and brilliantly handled.

As far as Rex is concerned, there's been no one like him since. All the classics are here, ""If I Could Talk To The Animals,"" ""I'm A Vegetarian,"" and my personal favorite ""Why Must We Treat Animals Like Animals?""

Filmmakers broke new ground, with daring portrayals of sex, violence, racial strife, the generation gap and interracial marriage. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences almost got it right. The Best Picture nominees were: Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, In the Heat of the Night and ...

Dr. Dolittle?

Two hours of push-me-pull-you's, bloated production values and Rex Harrison's interminable sing-talking (we had enough of this in My Fair Lady) has no business being mentioned with in the same breath as Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night. Thankfully, In the Heat of the Night won for Best Picture, avoiding the later travestys of films like Out of Africa, Dances with Wolves and The English Patient winning the award.
