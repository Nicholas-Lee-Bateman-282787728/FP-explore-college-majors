The music doesn't change throughout the entire length of the video and it is about 5 different notes over and over. The dancers have no rhythm. Was not a hit to say the least.",1451433600,,268,4.0754716981132075

8277926,5,B001AKV44A,I use (sometimes) Shadow Dancers at my DJ gigs when I DJ the proper place not going to use these at a graduation party I have a projection unit and put this on a rear projection screen (like a bed sheet) and looks nice.,1399334400,,219,4.0
8277927,5,B001AKV44A,"The Las Vegas Party Girls theme is awesome and another win for Shadow Dancers! If you can't travel to enjoy the nightlife of Vegas, let this dvd give you your fill of ""Sin City"" in a tasteful way! I absolutely love the background visuals on this dvd set! They are eyecatching and just a little bit mysterious to leave something to the imagination. Definitely perfect for VIP events!",1305331200,,382,4.632352941176471
8277928,5,B001AKV44A,"Shadow Dancers, Las Vegas Party Girls is just my latest buy from Shadow Dancers. I have most of the ones that this company produces. As a working DJ I must say that applied properly these series are terrific tools for VDJ's out there.
I have gotten great audience reactions every single time I show SD on my large screens.
As far as mixing music videos, these volumns provide outstanding content,
Shadow Dancers are a must have for anyone in the field!!!
