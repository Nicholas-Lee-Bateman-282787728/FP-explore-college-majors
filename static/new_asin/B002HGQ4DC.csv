In terms of the film, Billy Chong and Carl Scott are two of the most overlooked kung fu film stars in history. Shame really. What could have been!",1511568000,,296,4.711538461538462

8370360,4,B002HGQ4DC,"I HAVE BEEN A MARTIAL ARTIST FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I AM AN AVID COLLECTOR AND VIEWER OF MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES AND I TELL YOU THAT BILLY CHONG AND CARL SCOTT ARE TWO OF THE MOST TALENTED AND VERSATILE MARTIAL ARTIST AROUND.  THEIR TECHNIQUES AND QUICKNESS OF HANDS, ELBOWS, KNEES AND FEET ARE WELL EXECUTED. BILLY HAS GREAT SCREEN PRESENCE AND HAVE TRAINED IN THE MARTIAL ARTS SINCE HIS YOUTH AS DID CARL SCOTT UNDER STEVE MUHAMMAD(Steve Sanders. IF YOU LOVE THE MARTIAL ARTS AND WANT TO SPEND NINETY MINUTES WATCHING GREAT KUNG FU I SUGGEST YOU WATCH KUNG FU EXECUTIONER. IF YOU SAW IT BEFORE. WATCH IT AGAIN. BILLY CHONG AND CARL SCOTT SHOULD HAVE GONE INTERNATIONAL BUT DIDN'T. I WOULD DO A REMAKE OF THIS MOVIE WITH DONNIE YEN AND MICHAEL JAI WHITE. THEY COULD IN FOR THESE TWO GREAT MARTIAL ARTISTS.

8370361,3,B002HGQ4DC,"This was actually pretty good, they have an american on the film who does bruce lee's nun chucks moves just like it. When you look at the cover of the DVD, don't trust it because it's not about that time which made me angry; it take's place in the 1930's where the main character's father owns a shipyard (that you won't see in the film) but his family has some unfriendly competition with the neiborhood gangs who wants what the father has.",1323907200,,441,4.390243902439025
