5296322,1,B009ABLZZO,"I like old movies, but this was painful to watch. The video and audio quality were poor, and the 2 characters in the opening scene were not interesting at all. It's not that I look of action right out of the gate...I just did not have the fortitude to wait & see if the movie got better.",1411948800,,287,4.052631578947368
5296323,4,B009ABLZZO,"It's Never Too Late is a rollicking portrayal of sexism in a British ""Father Knows Best"" kind of setting. Every member of this slightly screwball family goes about his/her business unaware that the Mum is the most powerful family member and all are truly dependent upon her to keep things running. The actress daughter is bright but amazingly naive, the grandmother is domineering in a ""I'll just sit here and die without a cup of tea"" kind of way, the Dad has no awareness of anything past the nose he burines in the evening paper, the daughter-in-law with the screaming children thinks she's the only one with problems, etc, etc!! And -- they are all totally unaware that the Mum is a fabulously talented novelist, soon to leave for Hollywood, fame and fortune.

Of course, they will have to face life without Mum's support, and lessons are learned all around as grand complications ensue to the delight of the audience.

If you are in search of some light but quite British entertainment with good family values, you won't go wrong with It's Never Too Late!",1410134400,6,1060,4.724324324324324

5296327,2,B009ABLZZO,"I was excited to see this DVD on the market and quickly ordered it.  However, the title has little to do with the DVD and unfortunately, it was the title that grabbed me.  There are interesting tidbits on brain functioning but very little to do with what the ""blurb"" on what the DVD entailed - I was expecting a wrap up - okay now what do we do to get the brain going again - NOTHING - the DVD abruptly ended.  Also, the DVD was choppy/damaged. To their credit, the institution that sponsored the DVD responded quickly to my complaint.  When I informed them of the shortcoming of the DVD and the apparent misrepresentation of what the DVD offered, they quickly  stated that they viewed the DVD and that I was right: )  They sent me a new DVD and also, a bonus DVD in relation to another topic on brain functioning.",1391299200,2,814,4.322368421052632
5296328,4,B009ABLZZO,Great old movie. Human nature and humor without all the vulgarity in today's movies. A time when there was romance.,1376524800,2,115,4.8
5296329,3,B009ABLZZO,"A good old film in the British manner  which was charming at times. Well worth the time for the clothes and dated script. I found it a light and airy pleasure. Miss Calvert is adorable and a decent actress but not of the top rung. I would say she didn't really hit the bulls eye in the UK but it was fun and enjoyable. Worth your time if you like the brits way of doing things. Dated and delightful. A true escape from the US of A.

5296333,1,B009ABLZZO,"Everything that could be bad about a movie was bad....e v e r y t h i n g. The plot, as described was good, however it wasn't really followed in the storyline. We love old films and most things British - we were so surprised at just how bad this movie was, we watched all to the end hoping for something... it wasn't bad in the way you could mock it and laugh - just plain awful: senseless script, local theater group acting (no offense), random continuity issues, wayne's world production values, and a few times- the sound of a laugh track ! This was the first thing we excitedly watched after setting up our new amazon fire box. ARRRRGGGHH!",1425081600,3,643,4.322314049586777

5296337,1,B009ABLZZO,"I normally really like these older movies....however 23 minutes into this one and I just couldn't stand this one any longer. granny looks healthy enough to make her own cupper of tea.....the teenage daughter is so flighty and spoiled I couldn't listen to her voice go on.....and the son in law is worthless. Poor mum is stupid to put up with so much and not delegate more of the household chores off to the others.

This movei was just not my cup of tea.....",1417046400,5,458,4.4523809523809526
5296338,5,B009ABLZZO,"I loved this! Gentle, English humor but a delightful story. Its a feel-good movie--stay for the end! A movie that brings a smile to my face. They just don't make these type of movies anymore. A wholesome way to spend an hour or so. The lower star reviewers just don't understand the quaintness of movies made in the past.",1417046400,5,321,4.4576271186440675

8538345,1,B009ABLZZO,"As a writer, I often deal with ""never having enough time"" for writing because of family and household responsibilities, so I ignored the bad reviews and eagerly looked forward to this show.
Sure, ok, I could identify with how she felt up front because of that... But nothing was accomplished... and it ended **Spoiler Alert** with her back in the same place. Because you KNOW women can't do well outside the home, and they work best under stress... so when she gave herself time and space, she froze up. When she became everyones slave and dog of the house again, then she did MUCH better. Take that all you women who want to be outside the home! ;)
Everyone was terrible... her husband ignored her and flirted with young women and only got her back because he got tired of the other girl. Her mother was a manipulative menace. Her son was a HATEFUL dad to her grandkids. (Another pet peeve of mine... I HATE HATE HATE when they used to torment children in old movies just so they could have a crying scene in their movie!!! The dad undresses a baby girl and carries her around under his arm, head hanging down, while she is screaming and screaming and screaming FOR REAL, FOLKS! I REFUSE to be entertained by another's torment! It is awful!). The daughter in law is annoying and takes advantage of free babysitting everytime she can. The daughter is a brat.
Altogether, you wanted to destroy the family and set that poor mom free. It was hard to see her go cheerfully back to it...
If you want to see another film with Mom faithfulness, but without the family being so rotten, see ""I Remember Momma"" (1948)",1461110400,4,1607,4.525773195876289
