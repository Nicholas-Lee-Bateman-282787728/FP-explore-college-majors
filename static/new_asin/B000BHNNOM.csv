2417307,2,B000BHNNOM,"Stripilates isn't much for a 50 minute ""workout"". It is probably fine for a beginner looking for variety. This dvd is good if you are looking for a relaxing 50 minute exercise routine. If you are looking to break a sweat and get a good workout, go for Lara Hudson 10 minute piliates or yoga dvd.",1168905600,5,295,4.285714285714286
2417308,4,B000BHNNOM,"I've been so disappointed with the exercise videos I've purchased in the past but was pleasantly surprised with this one.  It's a lagitimate pilates tutorial that will really give you an intense workout (I was feeling it for days).  I especially loved that this video was modern and beautifully made.  So often, we get corney videos with bad music and an irritating instructor who talks too much!  Not this video!  All of the instructors were incredibly beautiful!  The only thing I wish they would have added is an actual routine at the end that compiled all the dance moves learned together.  Otherwise, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video.  Oh yeah, if you're new to pilates...give yourself time...this is a tough workout!",1168819200,7,719,4.933333333333334
2417309,5,B000BHNNOM,"I love this video. I'm pretty sure it's new to the exercise video market since I have only been seeing signs of it for the past month, but it definitely has an appeal. The main girl is really nice to watch and listen to. her voice above all elese is really soothing to hear so it's nice to workout to her instruction. Some of the exercises by the red headed girl were actually a challenge to do but I just skip and go on to the next routine which were much more appropriate for the novice. The world of stripping/strippers is now in the mainstream whether you like it or not. When the porn star Jenna Jameson is on a Time Square billboard....I'll leave it at that. Cool video. Looks really great and the girls are sexy without being slutty. Thumbs up Stripilates! Whatta name!!!",1127865600,38,778,4.372413793103449
2417310,5,B000BHNNOM,"You never know what to expect from exercise videos these days. Will it be too easy, too hard, is the instructor easy to listen to, is the instruction suitable, and on and on. Stripilates is a perfect combination of Pilates fused with exotic dance moves. What's great about this workout is that Stripilates shows the move you'd see in the strip club first with on-screen text on what parts of the body the dance club move works, then the move is taken in to the world of Pilates and turned in to a workout. It's quite genius. The workout is really great as it's broken up in to 5 sections so you can choose what area you want to work on (Abs, legs, buns, everything). There is something for all stages of Pilates. They start off with breathing and some simple pelvic moves to get you warmed up. Then they progressively get more complex so by the end you are energized and are moving your body with the beat of the music. The other great thing about this video is that there are three music options so you can listen to the instructor with music in the background, listen to just the voice over so you can put on your own music, or you can listen to only the music if you know the routines. It's well done and looks really nice too. Overall Stripilates is done very tastefully and made me feel sexy, which is hard to do at the gym!",1127692800,71,1329,4.277777777777778
8086809,5,B000BHNNOM,"I was nervous I wouldn't like this DVD, but it turned out to be great! I'm a beginner trying to get more into working out on a regular basis and have been looking for workout videos that I think are fun to do, in order to help me stay motivated. I thought this one was going to be a bit too cheesy for me, but it ended up being a very good Pilates workout with just enough affirmations to help me remember why I'm working out in the first place (self love, and attention from my man.) I would definitely recommend this DVD .",1473638400,,524,4.048076923076923
8086810,3,B000BHNNOM,"its fun, but not too challenging a workout",1410566400,,42,4.375
8086811,5,B000BHNNOM,"Adore Stripilates. Feel sensual while warm and sweaty at the end. This is a gradual workout, but at the end I was sweaty, feeling beautiful, and my abs love me! Not to mention it is an incredible stretch the whole time! The other reviews are so right about the woman's voice, it is so beautiful and motivating, there are so many positive affirmations the whole time! Every woman should feel this beautiful and sensual working out her gorgeous curves! Thank you.",1405728000,,461,4.703703703703703
8086812,5,B000BHNNOM,"I had this DVD and LOVED it!  I lost all of my ""baby weight"" using this video.  It was a great short workout and has some sexy dance moves for the more conservative or self-conscientious type.  Unfortunately when we moved, the movers stole our entire box of DVD's and I have been searching for this one ever since.  Now that I finally found it, I will be purchasing it!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1320624000,,394,4.492957746478873
8086813,5,B000BHNNOM,I gained a lot of weight with my second daughter. People thought that I would never get back to my original size. As soon as I was cleared to exercise again I started using this DVD. I used it every day for 6 weeks. By the time I went back to work I had lost most of my baby weight. No one could believe it. This DVD is great because it teaches the basics of pilates (the breathing technique) very well. It is not overly strenuous and I felt pretty sexy. Nothing motivates exercise like that. I absolutely LOVE this DVD.,1280102400,,520,4.158415841584159
8086814,5,B000BHNNOM,"I enjoyed this video! I am sick and tired of reading reviews of videos with an obvious stripper bent to them where uptight ladies whine that the material is too slutty. If you don't wanna feel stripperish and you think it's nasty don't get something with ""strip"" or ""exotic dance"" or ""erotic"" in the title. That said, it is a fun pilates workout with some nice stripper feeling to it with the little crawls, fan kicks, various hip gyrations and so on. It's a nice relaxing workout, unless you actually have your children pouncing on you while you are exercising vulnerable on the floor which is sometimes my experience. But that's an issue for me with any floor based workout. I did not finish feeling like an expert stripper, but I did learn some moves that I've seen in the club (nothing that looks too naughty with clothes on) and I was relaxed, invigorated, limbered up (the stretching is great) and I felt it in that special place in my abs that only pilates seems to reach. As a bonus my man was even entertained by watching me do it in front of the computer while he fixed his guns! It was a great time and the price was super too.",1274659200,,1138,4.398104265402844
8086815,3,B000BHNNOM,"Stripped off the ambient music, gyrating cameo of a girl in stripper costume, soft lighting, flushed cheek instructors, crotch shots...this is just a basic pilates. Great marketing tho.

8086816,2,B000BHNNOM,"It hardly showed any dance movements and most of the time was spent watch girls in closeups doing a few movements with some groaning.  I'm sure some teenage boy would love this video, although it is very tame.",1175558400,8,209,4.5
8086817,3,B000BHNNOM,This tape is basically a basic pilates workout DVD.  I thought it was going to teach some sensual moves and I was tad bit disappointed.  However the DVD did provide a decent workout.,1174780800,8,182,4.484848484848484
8086818,4,B000BHNNOM,"It's basically just pilates..has nothing to do with stripping, but the next day, all of my muscles were sore, so I know I used them all!  I think this really helps with toning your body!",1169164800,7,186,4.314285714285714
