2440447,3,B000BT96PK,"Though this reexamination of the variety of conspiracy theories contradicting the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible for the tragedy in Dallas is dry and academic in places, there's enough archival footage to get any history buff excited. There's not only a digitally remastered version of the still-gruesome Zapruder film, but also a really fine setting of the times, describing the powers of the Mafia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cuba, the USSR and the right-wing in America, separately and together motivated to remove the young, popular president. Historian Arthur Schlesinger and writer Jack Anderson provide interesting anecdotes and comments, and, while no specific theory is completely embraced, the DVD remains a fascinating look at a painful and troubling part of our history.",1142121600,29,802,5.424
2440448,5,B000BT96PK,"First of all, let me just say that I am very qualified to give a review of any film concerning the JFK assassination.  I am currently a professor of psychology at Texas A&M International University with an educational background in sociology and political science.  I began my research on the Kennedy assassination more than 8 years ago as an honors student in a Texas History class.  Since then, I have returned to the subject on and off and have given presentations on the subject as a graduate student and more recently as a professor.  In the process of doing my research, I came across Noel Twyman's book Bloody Treason.  At first I was turned off by the dramatic title (which I later discovered was a line from Shakespeare's Ceasar), but once I read the book (over 800 pages) I realized it was very objective and scholarly, and the approach of the author was that of a prosecuting attorney making his case before a court of sceptics. I admired the depth of this man's research and was very surpised that his work did not receive the respect or attention it most certainly deserved.  Either way, I later watched the Final Chapter episodes of the Men Who Killed Kennedy on the History Channel, and while I had some minor objections to the simplicity of its conclusions regarding the Texas connection, I feel that Nigel Turner nonetheless deserves praise for his great contribution to this line of historical research.  Having reached my own conclusions, I had put the subject of the Kennedy assassination to rest for a while.  Then I came across The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History on DVD while perusing through some newly released DVDs.  I have to say that I wasn't eager to spend another $18 on a JFK assassination DVD that I knew next to nothing about.  But I finally decided to take a chance and make the purchase.  I was not dissapointed in the least.  In fact, I was suprisingly impressed with how much detailed information was revealed in this DVD and how well the filmmaker compiled news footage that was either rare or very hard to find.  The most interesting and indeed the most important aspect of this film is that it places the JFK assassination in the context of the global and national sociopolitical atmosphere.  In that sense, it also offers a very detailed analysis of historical events during the late 1950s and early 1960s.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the film, unlike the Men Who Killed Kennedy series, doesn't draw any firm conclusions, but definitely gives the viewer enough information to continue doing research on their own.  In sum, if you want to get to the truth of the Kennedy assassination, read Bloody Treason by Noel Twyman, watch the Final Chapter episodes of the Men Who Killed Kennedy (including the older episodes), and buy the Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History on DVD.",1142121600,167,2831,4.735234215885947
2440449,4,B000BT96PK,"Probably the most interesting documentary on the events preceding and following the JFK assassination I've ever seen.  Full of terrific news footage that makes the time period come  alive, including a strange news clip of Jack Ruby's lawyer telling newscameras that being in Dallas makes him want to vomit!  This documentary tends to lean towards conspiracy, careful to never vocally express that viewpoint as THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY did.  It offers a lot to think about without taking a firm stance, which I appreciated.

Anyway, there's much to process here.  If you've got any interest in the case, in the Kennedys, in Castro or the Cold War, you'll enjoy this DVD.",1142035200,41,671,4.946428571428571

2440451,5,B000BT96PK,"I've seen every video about JFK, and in my opinion this is clearly the best one.  It wasn't LBJ, it wasn't the CIA, it wasn't the FBI, and it wasn't Castro or the USSR -- yet Lee Harvey Oswald clearly had accomplices.

Doesn't that mean that LBJ, the CIA and the FBI lied to us?  Not really; it was a matter of national security, to prevent a CIvil War in America, so the truth could not be revealed for 75 years according to Earl Warren.  Well, now that the USSR has fallen and the Cold War is clearly over and done with, popular demand gave us the JFK act, so that in 2017 we can expect all the evidence to be released -- and when it is released, we'll almost certainly discover that this video got it right.

The experts in this video include the most capable researchers, including Jack Anderson, Arthur Schlesinger, Sam Halpern, Gaeton Fonzi, Gerald McKnight, David Wrone, Peter Kornbluh, Gordon Winslow and John Frankenheim.

I believe that no one knows who killed Kennedy, but it's clear that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill him. I recommend two sources that could help understand the assassination: ""Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film"", which clearly shows that one of the shots that were fired from the grassy knoll hit him in the front of his neck and tore his head off. This leaves Oswald out of the picture and negates the Warren Commission's absurd single bullet theory. The second source I recommend is Oliver Stone's film ""JFK Director's Cut"" which follows New Orleans Investigator Jim Garrison, who followed many leads, but cannot name the assassin because there were at least 3 shooters on the grassy knoll and no one knows who they were.",1383177600,4,883,4.703225806451613

2440466,5,B000BT96PK,"The rich and powerful still own each and every one of us. Look at what happened to the only President to stand up to them.
They blew his head apart, while emory roberts (head of our president's secret service detail for that day) set him up and sat back and watched it happen. I wonder how much it costs to buy an agent. roberts even called back a agent that was going to help, after our president was hit, by the 2nd bullet. The first one missed.
johnson knew too, look at the smile on his face, in the motorcade. He knew exactly what was going to happen. He and his oil buddies in Texas got together, (The BU#@ Family) to figure it out.
THEY WANTED THEIR WAR IN FING VIETNAM. Johnsons carreer was over, and he wanted to be President, (No matter the cost)That's why Johnson was covered and pushed down by Rufus Youngblood, (a honest agent) after he ""saw some commotion in the President's car"". He leaped out of the front seat, and covered johnson. After he had johnson covered and safe, he heard the final two shots. It's all in his report. How did he leap over the back, of johnsons car while the other agent's behind, and in Kennedy's car did nothing.
Then about the agents in the front seat of the presidential car, The president, said quite clearly ""My God, I'm hit"" before he passed out. Then the driver practically stops, and looks back, like he is waiting......... ""Oh there it is, the kill shot. Punch it."" Almost like he was expecting it. They LET our President get assassinated! Then emory roberts radios back to johnsons car ""They got him. They got him."" (interesting choice of words).Watch this and learn a little, about how we lost our country.
John Kennedy was an incredibly brave soul, so was Bobby.
More than one of us knows what is really going on with our country, and how we lost it, so many years ago. Study and decided for yourself. Everything is out there.
But stand up and tell the American people the truth, and they (the ones really in charge) will KILL you. (Make it look like anything. (Heart attack, car accident, lone gunman) WE better wake up.
They want a bunch of uniformed, obedient workers, that believe all the crap they tell you.

2440467,5,B000BT96PK,"The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History was a very alumininating documentry of events,surrounding the COLD WAR,The Bay Of Pigs Invasion,and JFK's mishandling of the invasion by refusing to provide the necessary air support that was critical in making the invasion and overthrow of Fidel Castro a success,and the fiasco that rsulted,and the firing of CIA chief Allen Dulles,and his deputy Charles Cabel,and director of plans Richard Bissell as a resulted in JFK aquiring so many enemies,who had motives to want him dead?

2440476,3,B000BT96PK,"I've read about 30 books on the Kennedy years and Kennedy assassination, as well as the Warren Report, and countless programs about it.  I feel I have a pretty solid base for a description - and if you're looking for anything new regarding the assassination, you won't find it here.

The first half of this film is top-notch, discussing some key events of Kennedy's presidency and providing excellent archival footage and interesting analysis.  The assassination itself was described very quickly and without much detail, which is fine - I mean, what are we going to hear that we haven't heard before?  So by that point in the film, I was thinking it was going to continue to be terrific.

I was wrong.  At that point it devolves into incredibly broad generalities that are all directed toward one thing - suggesting that there was definitely a conspiracy in the assassination, that the Warren Commission were little more than lackeys to the FBI and set out with a deliberate agenda to arrive at the conclusions in the Report, and to give a great deal of air-time to several nicely-dressed conspiracy nuts.

My problem with that is that there was no balance.  They showed Gerald Posner for about 10 seconds and mentioned his book, then allow it (with no evidence presented) to be trashed as a book of lies.  And while there were plenty of problems with Posner's book, it was more responsible to fact than most books on the subject, but would leave the casual viewer with the impression that to arrive at the same conclusion as the Warren Commission, you must be full of it.

Basically it became just another conspiracy program.  It offers all kinds of speculation and no proof of anything, which was an incredible disappointment.  This was one half of a terrific program, and was worth the $15 just for that first hour or so.  The last half is pretty irresponsible and could not be taken seriously by anyone who knows more than a little about the case.

It's okay.  Worth a look for that first half.  Watch the second half to see if you concur with me - and if you do forget that last half and watch the first half again.  That half is definitely worth having.",1183766400,16,2160,4.6272965879265096

It also goes into a lot about the autopsy and whether the shot to the President's head did damage that looked like this or that. It also explains something about who may have controlled things and why, so that the Warren Commission was so resolute in it's final assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole shooter, inspite of the overwhelming amount of information to the contrary. A very good DVD to see to add further information to the knowledge on this event in history.",1176768000,12,882,4.484472049689441
2440478,5,B000BT96PK,"Excellent DVD! The historical footage as well as enigmatic soundtrack added to the documentary without being overly dramatic or campy. The historical background material adds perspective to the whole issue. When watching ""JFK"" (Oliver Stone, starring Kevin Kostner), the movie very poorly touches on the issue of the mafia...although I knew the history of the Cuban revolution, I never connected why they might want to shoot Kennedy. Or the Mafia for that matter! ""JFK"" leaned heavily on the Coup-de-tat end of the conspiracy theory, while this documentary evened things out more and made more sense of the history that would have contributed to Kennedy's assassination.

I believe there was a conspiracy...but watching the real Zapruder film of the shooting, unedited, in this documentary, leaves me with only more questions. The shot would have seemed to come from the back (a head bobbing back when shot from behind isn't uncommon...its not the force of the bullet as much as the muscles relaxing). An exit wound is far larger and messier than an entrance wound. In the Zapruder film, its obvious that the messy wound is in the front, indicating he was shot from behind. The angle of the shot seems wrong, however and the autopsy footage clearly shows and exit wound at his neck. There seemed to be some evidence, watching the Zapruder film that the exit wound was up near the temple, not the neck. It is hard to see on such a small film.

Anyways, fascinating. Watch this, watch JFK. Compare the two. Both great movies.",1173052800,4,1523,4.9221789883268485
2440479,4,B000BT96PK,"""The Murder Of JFK: A Revisionist History"" makes a very nice addition to any collection of John F. Kennedy-related materials (regardless of whether you're ""pro-conspiracy"", ""anti-conspiracy"", or somewhere in between with respect to your particular beliefs regarding President Kennedy's assassination). Although a definite thread of conspiratorial belief most certainly is woven into this documentary, it's not shamefully brazen or overly ridiculous-sounding in terms of conspiracy, which is unlike many of the other outlandish JFK theories and plots that have been postulated in the various books, films, and documentaries over the years.

What this program fails to do, though, is to delve in any depth whatsoever into the life (and more importantly, the mind) of Lee Harvey Oswald....a man who I believe killed John Kennedy all by himself in 1963.

Oswald's role in the assassination is pretty much glossed over here; and, strangely, Jack Ruby (the man who killed Oswald on 11/24/63) is barely even mentioned in this documentary. There's a short clip of Ruby murdering Oswald in the police basement, but after that snippet the subject of Ruby comes up (as I recall) only one other time, during a rather strange film clip showing a group of protestors demanding the immediate release of Dallas prisoner ""John Ruby"". (Oddly, these protestors didn't even seem to know the true name of the man they were fighting so hard to have released from jail.)

""A Revisionist History"" is a lengthy program, with a running time of 140 minutes (not the 180 minutes that is advertised on the DVD). It was made in 1999 and won an award for ""best use of news footage in a documentary"". And I can see why. This DVD is loaded with rare news snippets associated with JFK's terrible murder, which occurred in Dallas, Texas, on November 22nd, 1963. There are many news clips presented here that I had never seen before, including quite a bit of footage taken during the years leading up to Kennedy's death.

""Revisionist"" hints at a possible ""Cuban connection"" with respect to JFK's ultimate demise, and thusly this documentary features several video and film clips taken in Havana around the time that Fidel Castro gained control of Cuba. One such interesting clip was culled from ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" of January 5, 1960, where Sullivan puts on his interviewer's hat and asks Castro some hard-hitting questions. Fidel, in a classic bit of irony, informs Mr. Sullivan (and, hence, America) .... ""You can be sure that Batista will be the last dictator of Cuba"".

Some of the video footage seen in this program can also be found in another excellent, must-see documentary film on the Kennedy assassination, that being 1964's ""Four Days In November"" (narrated by actor Richard Basehart).

""Four Days"" in many ways serves as a good companion program to ""A Revisionist History"", insofar as presenting a large dose of vintage filmed materials relating to the JFK case.

In my own opinion, ""Four Days In November"" (which consists of almost nothing but vintage, archival news footage, circa 1963) is superior to all other Kennedy films and documentaries, with a musical score by Elmer Bernstein that is also second to none. But this ""Revisionist History"" program has its own set of high points in the ""vintage footage"" department as well, making it a pretty good bookend piece to ""Four Days"".

Some of the highlights worth noting from ""A Revisionist History"" include:

>> A good-sized portion of a June 22, 1964, interview with Texas Governor John Connally (via KRLD-TV in Dallas). Mr. Connally, after having recounted the entire assassination sequence which had occurred exactly seven months earlier, becomes quite emotional at the end of this footage. This black-and-white clip (which appears to be on videotape and not film) exhibits super-sharp video and audio quality.

>> Footage showing John Connally introducing Lyndon Johnson as a candidate for the Presidency at the Democratic National Convention on July 10, 1960.

>> Two brief rarely-seen film clips (in color) showing Lee Harvey Oswald during his altercation with police on the streets of New Orleans in the summer of 1963.

>> The November 29, 1963, telephone conversation between new President Lyndon Johnson and Senator Richard Russell, discussing the creation of LBJ's Warren Commission, of which Senator Russell was strongly opposed to being a member (as can be heard in this phone call). Excellent audio quality attached to this clip, too.

>> Very, very rare film clip (I'd never seen it before) showing Warren Commission members standing outside the Texas School Book Depository Building in Dallas in July 1964. This B&W film footage is accompanied by audio as well, with the microphones picking up some comments made by Allen Dulles and David Belin. This unique footage also shows Dulles and Belin looking out at Elm Street (where JFK was assassinated) from behind the picket fence atop the now-famous Grassy Knoll in Dealey Plaza.*

* = I thought that that particular ""Behind The Picket Fence"" portion of this 1964 footage was rather interesting, in that it certainly indicated that the Warren Commission members were, in a sense, not totally ignoring the idea that one or more shots on 11/22/63 could have conceivably come from behind that fence -- otherwise, why would the Commission and its staff have even bothered to have a look for themselves at the view that a potential assassin would have had from that Knoll vantage point? (Conspiracists will no doubt argue that the Commission members were merely ""going through the motions"" for the press, which was following the WC's every move in Dealey Plaza that day, as can be observed in these film clips.)

>> Portions of a BBC-TV special entitled ""The Death Of Kennedy"", in which the Single-Bullet Theory is discussed (and even re-constructed on camera using mock-ups of victims Kennedy and Connally). This BBC clip, which is in B&W, also includes comments made by Warren Commission counsel member Arlen Specter, as Mr. Specter defends his position aggressively with these words: ""You call it the theory; I call it the conclusion; it was a theory until we found the facts; that's why I refer to it as the Single-Bullet Conclusion"".**

** = Note: The DVD claims this BBC program aired on January 27, 1964; but that's an obvious error/typo. The SBT had not even been postulated by Specter and the WC as of that January '64 date. The Commission, in fact, as of that date in early 1964, had barely even begun their work. That BBC broadcast was actually aired on January 29, 1967.

>> Rare color footage of a portion of the FBI/WC re-enactment of the assassination from the 6th-Floor window of the Book Depository (as seen through the scope mounted on Lee Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle). I didn't know that color footage of the FBI re-creations even existed until viewing this DVD. This snippet is very, very short, but it's quite interesting seeing it in fairly-vivid color.

>> A September 27, 1964, news clip from a CBS-TV special (""November 22nd And The Warren Report""), with Walter Cronkite giving a general overview of the just-released Warren Report. Cronkite speaks forcefully about the facts and evidence of Oswald's guilt during this B&W news clip. I especially enjoyed Mr. Cronkite's first blunt and to-the-point observation re. the Warren Report: ""Oswald was a liar"". (Darn right he was, Walter. LHO never stopped lying from the minute he was arrested in the Texas Theater. And it's great hearing a newsman reporting it like it is.)

>> A portion of Walter Cronkite's September 1969 CBS-TV interview with former President Lyndon Johnson, during which JFK's assassination is openly and candidly discussed. (Note: Oddly, this particular in-color news clip with Johnson and Cronkite is shown in a 1.66:1 Widescreen format on the DVD. A few other clips on the DVD are also shown in Widescreen for some reason.)

>> March 1975 footage of the late-night talk show ""Good Night America"" with Geraldo Rivera -- The Zapruder Film (showing JFK's murder) is broadcast for the first time on national television. This color clip includes Robert Groden's blatant exaggeration of the number of witnesses that he claims heard shots from the Grassy Knoll on 11/22/63 (""80 percent""). Groden deliberately overstated the number of Knoll earwitnesses in order to further his own notions of a JFK conspiracy. In reality, well more than 50% of all earwitnesses in Dealey Plaza said they heard shots from BEHIND the President's car, and not from in front of it.

This same ""Good Night America"" footage (in expanded form) can also be found on another MPI Home Video release from 1998 -- ""Image Of An Assassination: A New Look At The Zapruder Film"" (which is another very worthwhile collectible DVD product pertaining to the Kennedy murder case).

>> Color film clip of Congressman Christopher Dodd interrogating former CIA Director Richard Helms on September 22, 1978, during the House Select Committee's inquiry into JFK's death. Stinging remarks by Mr. Helms can be heard in this clip, which is footage that's not in very good shape, picture-quality-wise.

In the years following JFK's murder, Richard Helms, obviously sick of having his agency raked over the coals and suspected of having a hand in Kennedy's death, always exhibited a harsh and brusk tone in every comment I ever heard him make publicly in wake of President Kennedy's assassination. Helms' comments, however, come off as rather foolish-sounding in this specific clip re. ""AM/LASH"".

>> Video clip of an irate Wesley Liebeler (Assistant Counsel member of the Warren Commission) in the early 1990s, wherein Mr. Liebeler publicly denounces the Oliver Stone film ""JFK"". Liebeler: ""Your movie is a vast tissue of falsehood, deception, and distortion. .... Your movie cannot be defended on a factual basis"".

>> The ""Castro Playing Ping-Pong For Three Hours"" video clip. (Consult the DVD for more details on this humorous footage.) ;)

In-A-Nutshell Breakdown Of This Program:

Pros:

>> Many rare and hard-to-find-anyplace-else news clips.
>> Good video (DVD) quality.
>> Peter Dean's solid narration. (Peter also, btw, served as narrator for MPI's ""Image Of An Assassination"" documentary.)

Cons:

>> Could probably have been edited down to a shorter length.
>> The music score (which isn't very impressive, IMO).
>> Not enough background information on Lee Oswald.

Overall......

I think that conspiracy theorists and lone-assassin believers alike will be able to appreciate many things within this MPI program, with the wealth of seldom-seen film footage that is presented here, all by itself, being worth the cost of this disc for ardent collectors of JFK-related material.",1143244800,69,11793,5.157150340492405
8092161,5,B000BT96PK,"I own a huge collection of JFK assassination books/videos and this one by far contains the most amount of information within it. Watching this doc one realizes how massive the events of history intertwine and anyone living in this new information age would have to be living with ones head buried in the sand to still believe that the Warren Commissions conclusion that Oswald alone killed Kennedy is as one dimensional as it actually is. One can forgive persons living back then because the faith in Government had yet to be tarnished within the publics mind and information was much easier to cover up back then by the powers that be. It has been said that the truth will always surface, as it does here even though it sometimes takes decades to do so. This entire event is so complicated and spider webs into a thousand off-shoots that are connected to other events.
It also shows how humans with a taste for power are capable of anything and will do anything to keep that power. No person is an angel as well as no person is a pure devil but it does show how corrupt politics and Government service can be if left unchecked.
The one thing I can criticize about this doc is that in the beginning hour or so its presentation with certain graphics and editing style is very amateurish but luckily after a while it goes to the standard style of presenting the images, but after a while it goes back to these same graphics with pop-up windows and other cheap effects. The entire doc as a whole has a very uneven feel but the fact of so much great information does not make up for it but make it tolerable. Unfortunately there is some really great and as far as I am concerned, I could be wrong here, there is a lot of never before seen footage around the assassination time frame that is compromised and of such poor quality it is truly frustrating.
Even those scoffers of any and all conspiracies cannot in any good conscience see the abundance of interviews and evidence presented and at the very least admit that things are not as cut-and-dried as conservative history is presented in our schools or corporate owned media. Throw out even 75% of this evidence and there is still enough for the average person to raise serious doubts about the acknowledged and sanitized history of the latter half of the 20th century in America.
A must for any assassination buff and/or serious historians.",1511049600,,2390,4.586448598130841
