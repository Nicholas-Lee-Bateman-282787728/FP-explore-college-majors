6454053,5,B00KYQS6UG,"Turtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an outstanding documentary. Allow myself to preface this review by saying I've been a TMNT fan for as long as I can remember, with the original Eastman & Laird comics, the 1990 film adaptation, the cartoon series, and the action figures being absolutely huge parts of my childhood life. I loved the Turtles. They were one of my favorite things ever, and truth be told, they still kind of are, and almost for all the same reasons I loved them as a kid. They're wildly unique, inventive, with a hint of edge, darkness, and grittiness to them, in their original comic book form.

However, what personally makes these characters work so well for me is that they're extremely versatile. The tone of whatever medium they appear in can range from dark, violent, and sometimes scary, to light, happy, kid-friendly, and overall, fun. I believe fun is the key word, here, since these characters do seem so fun to write, drawn, animate, etc., and that's rarely forgotten in the mediums they've appeared in, regardless of the tone being heavy or light.

Now, I bring all of this up because this is an important aspect of this film. Turtle Power delves deep into the history of these characters, their overarching stories, their breakout success, and the inspirations that birthed them. We get to see the stories behind easily the most important interpretations of these characters, whether it be comic, film, animation, or even toys.

Essentially, the film is a recount of a story about two incredibly lucky comic book artists who were releasing comic books for their own fun, and hit it big with the Turtles. It's great to see extensive interviews with Eastman and Laird on these characters, of course, but the film goes far past its initial comic book origins.

The documentary covers virtually everything TMNT related from 1984 until around 1990, with the release of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. You get to see virtually everything in that time span, including the creation of the Playmates toy line, the 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon series that skyrocketed the Turtles into mainstream success, and of course, a ton of back story and production elements from the 1990 film. These things I've listed aren't all the film covers, mind you, but this is what a majority of time is spent on.

Much like the original comics, as well as the 1990 film, this documentary started as an independent work. This was a fan film that's been begging to be made and released for a good while now, and it's clear that a lot of care and attention were given by the filmmakers to not only make this film as entertaining as possible, but to also make it surprisingly in depth, sometimes touching, and almost by default, incredibly nostalgic.

The visual style of the film tends to follow suit in the 1990 film, with a lot of establishing shots of gritty looking alleyways, subways, and the like. The footage shot looks great, as do the interviews, and you'll be surprised to see footage you never knew existed. We're talking footage from some of the original meetings Eastman & Laird had with Playmates toys, with the two co-creators discussing how the design of the figures should be, and their reluctance for selling-out, to name a few. The interviews are also laced with old photographs from the comic book production at Mirage Studios, as well as motion comic-ish images from the original comics. Put simply, the film looks great, and it's very clearly a love letter to TMNT, its creators, and its fans.

There is also some more footage sprinkled in the film that was shot during the production of the original 1990 TMNT film, and it's just great to hear the stories of how everything came to be and fell into place. Effectively, that's what this documentary achieves; it does show you, every step of the way, how everything fell in place for these characters to be successful, and honestly, that's one of the main draws to this film.

The documentary runs at a brisk pace. It never stays on one subject for too long. It transitions from comic, to animation, to action figure segments seamlessly. It's so clear that so much love and affection for the franchise was put into making this film, and it's a better film for it.

We get interview footage with the voice cast of the cartoon series, actors from the movies, producers, directors, etc. Virtually anyone that had a hand in bringing TMNT to kids everywhere was interviewed for this film. It's surprisingly thorough, and even more surprisingly engaging. It's hard to imagine living in a world where TMNT had never existed, and it's such an amazing thing to watch these characters almost take on a life of their own.

I would say this film is more enjoyable if you are a fan of TMNT, but even outside of that level, for general audiences who know who the Turtles are with no deep interest in them, this is still an entertaining documentary, through and through. The interviews are entertaining and informative, the visual style of the film nails down TMNT aesthetics perfectly, and the soundtrack comprised of the director's own music is a sometimes somber, but always fitting one. This is a fantastic documentary that I suggest everyone, even those with just a passing interest in the Turtles, watch. It's absolutely worth your time, even more-so if TMNT was a huge part of your childhood, or beyond. It doesn't leave out any details of what it does cover, and it's easily one of the most tasteful TMNT related products to ever release.

If you see one Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie in 2014, make it this one. This is almost the antithesis of the loud, flashy, shallow Bay produced affair, and is the better film by a long shot. Don't pass this one up.",1407801600,4,5764,4.75975975975976
6454054,4,B00KYQS6UG,"As a preface, I obtained a pre-release copy of this DVD from the studio and wrote a full review over at DVD Talk.  Feel free to check it out for more information!

""Turtle Power"" is a 98-minute documentary by Randall Lobb and a team of friends and fellow filmmakers, all with a love of the TMNT franchise.  This self-financed film details the history of the pop culture phenomenon from its humble kitchen-table roots as a black-and-white comic series to the popular 1987 animated show and beyond.  Very few stones are left unturned, although the more recent material isn't covered in as much detail.  The franchise's non-stop wave of merchandise is talked about as well, from the original Playmates figures onward.  Featured participants include co-creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, animation producer Fred Wold, head writer / developer David Wise, Mirage Studio comic artists, the 1987 voice actors and many, many more.  All things considered it's surprisingly well-rounded and accessible if you're a new or die-hard fan of the Ninja Turtles.

Paramount serves up this DVD release (no Blu-ray option, unfortunately) as a movie-only disc, sadly omitting the extras that would most certainly have made this more of a collector's item.  Deleted scenes would've been nice, at the very least.  But the film itself is a strong effort and worth watching, at least more so than the Michael Bay-produced movie debuting in theaters tomorrow.",1407369600,18,1438,5.133047210300429
6454055,5,B00KYQS6UG,"This documentary will be AMAZING! Just watching the mini webisodes on youtube.com which provided a making of this movie/documentary, showed the love, talent and humor that went into this doc. Covering thirty years of Kevin Eastman and Peter laird's heroes in the half shell,  I honestly have NEVER in my life anticipated anything as much as I have anticipated this dvd release date. I have waited 2 long years and the time has finanally arrived. This is a MUST HAVE for any and all Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans and. ""Turtle Power""",1407196800,3,535,4.815217391304348

6454057,4,B00KYQS6UG,"This is a great story of two indie comic artists, who couldn't be more different from each other, and struck gold.  It delves into the world of the early 80's indie b&w comic scene and is a great piece of history for anyone who collected them during that era.

It's definitely NOT the definitive history like the title makes it out to be, as it glosses over everything past the first movie.  If most of your memories of the turtles came from 2000 and beyond, you'll be disappointed at the lack of later content featured.

That said, it's still a great story onto itself and is done really well.  If you're interested in other 80's / 90's comic documentaries, I'd also suggest ""The Story of Rock n' Roll Comics"" and ""The Image Revolution.""",1465084800,,738,4.518796992481203
6454058,3,B00KYQS6UG,"As other reviewers have said, it's not as definitive as one would hope.
Now part of that is unavoidable, seeing that more and more keep getting added to the pantheon that is TMNT. The other part however is that what is here, isn't enough.
The creators of this documentary cover a decent amount of surface area, but it's very shallow. The second and third movie are barely if at all touched apon, they don't even go into the other cartoons, no real insights into why they made the musical.
However is hardly all bad, truthfully the good outweigh the bad here. It just seems that they focused far too much on the early years and not really the legacy of the franchise.
Would still recomnend it to a turtles fan, but maybe see if you have a friend that you could borrow it from instead of buying it.",1464566400,,796,4.385135135135135

6454063,3,B00KYQS6UG,"I was fortunate enough to have found this documentary online in it's entirety. I'm a big turtles fan but never purchased this DVD because of the less than stellar reviews it's gotten. I suppose my complaints with this film won't be any different than the many others out there. The first forty minutes are awesome as the creators discuss they're influences, initial meeting, & the formation of Mirage Studios. It's also very cool to see footage from much of the early artwork of the original comics & hear commentary from the other artists who've had a hand in the classic comic books & early days of the turtles. It would've been cool had they kept their focus on the comic books but ""Turtle Power"" basically looks to cover the phenomena as a whole & not just the books. I get that but a little less time could've been spent on the voice actors of the original show & the embarrassing ""Turtles on tour"" musical & maybe feature a bit more at perhaps the very awesome 4Kids animated series that lasted from 2003 until 2010, the Kevin Munroe cgi movie, or even the current, smash hit IDW comic book series. No mention of these whatsoever. It was cool though to see the history of the first action figure line from Playmates as well as the stories behind the original five episode pilot of the original cartoon series, & of course the first live action movie. Turtle Power is definitely put together well but falls off somewhere & is an incomplete documentary.",1444608000,,1457,4.607692307692307

Yet, with so much information, archival footage, and interviews with key people, there's no loss of excitement you're watching something produced with love for the subject. There are enough transition moments of the Turtles in action to satisfy that nostalgia as you're learning what was going on behind the scenes in the 80s and early 90s. This documentary takes its time step by step telling the story of the original comic, licensing the toys, producing the cartoons and then the movies. I must mention thanks to the foresight of the original TMNT creators, we have archival footage of key moments in history: their drawings of the Turtles, licensing meetings, etc. We also see brief clips of media reaction.",1427500800,,803,4.955555555555556

There are some pictures in the background of the later timeline, but they really just concentrate on the early days.
Not to say that isn't interesting, but I would have liked to have seen them go further into the history then they did.
They cover Eastman and Laird meeting, and what they went through with the first issue and getting their studio together.
They cover the original comic, the Archie comic version, the deal with Playmate, the 1987 animated series, the 1990 movie (the 1991 and 1993 movies are mentioned in passing) and then the 1997 live stage show.

It really annoyed me for all these years that there was no dvd version that included any of that information and REAL struggle to get the film made. But here it is and it makes this dvd a great companion piece to that original dvd. Probably the most touching thing about Turtle Power is watching today's kids interviewed and playing with the new batch of toys, to a wonderfully composed original song made specifically for the dvd. Any fan must have this dvd in his collection.

Oh...but at least there is the Coming Out of Their Shells...wait, what??

This is less a 'Definitive Documentary' on the Turtles and more on the bio of Eastman & Laird. And then not to have any of the voice actors of the Ninja Turtles from the live action movies? No Robbie Rist, or Corey Feldman, or Josh Pais, or Brian Tochi?

They made breakfast cereal and pajamas out of a violent Frank Miller ripoff indie comic they self-financed! COME ON! That's hilarious! Why so much with the soft-focus reverence and cheap new-age, heartstring-tugging music? If you watch this, you'll have to sit through action figure tycoons and animation barons talking about how IMPORTANT and LIFE-CHANGING the turtles were to the whole world. It was a silly endeavor that made them tons of money, which the creators squandered, from what I've heard. Could we please have a clearer picture of what went down? The interview footage of Brian Henson and Kevin Clash was enlightening, for sure. Like a dope, I expected some explanation of the Usagi Yojimbo action figure and the Cerebus crossover in the comics. You know, reaching out to other independent comic creators and helping them make more money? Also the fact that Metallica thanks TMNT in the credits of ""Ride The Lightening."" And that Raphael mentions ""Master Of Puppets"" in the ""Stompers"" issue. Some fun stories about those connections, please!

The original comics were gorgeous, and I'll love them forever.  Thanks, Eastman and Laird.",1410134400,2,1376,5.079646017699115
6454111,3,B00KYQS6UG,"Turtle Power is a documentary film that covers or claims to cover the ""definitive history of the teenage mutant ninja turtles"". It falls short of this because it seems that, at only 1 hr 40 mins, it could have been a lot longer and could have included much more info and rare or behind the scenes footage.

The film focuses heavily on the creators of the turtles, the original comic book being started, the original cartoon series, the first live action movie, the merchandising, and the music tour. That's it! And while these sections of Turtle History are adequately covered, they could have given the viewer a lot more. What they either missed completely or partially ignored were: the second and third live action films, the live action TV show The Next Mutation, the 2007 animated film TMNT, the 2003 cartoon series, and nothing about the current 2012 cartoon series, the IDW comic book or the recently released 2014 live action/CGI movie.

It is very satisfying to see behind the scenes footage of things like the 1990 film as it never had any special features released however it is disappointing that the more recent history of the franchise is breezed over so quickly or just ignored. For the hours and hours of ""other footage"" that can be found on Youtube, it its sad that this clocks in at under 2 hours. A 3 hour documentary with behind the scenes interviews and deleted scenes from the LIVE ACTION TMNT films would have been stellar. It is a fun watch but ultimately a letdown.",1409616000,4,1490,4.683206106870229
6454112,4,B00KYQS6UG,"It's a great documentary, filled with emotion and surprises. Little sad near the end, but if you know the story, you'll know why.

6454113,3,B00KYQS6UG,"Newcomer Lobb makes a great job explaining the origin of the independent comic and laying clearly that so many accidents had to take place for the turtles to become this big.

He manages to interview the voice talent for the first cartoon, Peter Laird, KEvin Eastman and several former mirage studios artists.
He even has video of the toys negotitations.

He runs out of time and sadly all that has happened after 1993 is barely touched upon.

So, this is really focused in the first 10 years of the turtles",1408752000,2,507,4.611111111111111
6454114,4,B00KYQS6UG,"First let me state that I've been following this doc since it's inception.  I was actually interviewed for it way back in 2009 and it's exciting to see it's finally finished!  With that said I am actually rather disappointed and here's why.

1.  They've been releasing tidbits here and there online for a long time now.  A lot of us have seen some of the amazing interviews they got and it's an utter shame to see a large portion of them weren't used.

2.  This is far from a ""Definitive History"".  I wish they would have called this ""The Early Years"" because honestly that's what it covers.  They completely glaze over everything after the first film.  There was a golden opportunity to talk about the fourth film that almost made it into production.  It would have been nice to see more light shed on that project and why it wasn't made.  They don't talk about TMNT in other countries*such as the anime*, the Red Sky seasons of the old series, Next Mutation, the Image books, the 2003 series, TMNT, Laird's fourth volume of the comics, or anything that occurred after the buy out.  It would have also been nice to see them address the Warner Brothers cartoon series that was almost made as well as the CGI one that actually had a trailer.

Another missed opportunity was talking about the fifth film that Peter Laird was working on.  First it was a sequel to TMNT and then it became what was to be the first live action PG-13 Turtles film.  I would have liked more light shed on that.  Possibly the biggest let down though was they interviewed Lloyd Goldfine, the creator of the Turtles Forever film, but he is barely in the film at all.  Again this is because they pass over the 2003 series and again this is disappointing as Turtles Forever is one of the coolest TMNT things ever made.  Honestly all of this is made more confusing by the little timelines they cut to of each turtle that show all these things.

3.  Almost all of the footage from the movies to commercials are shown to us in tiny TV screens.  I'm not clear on why they did this.  At first I thought it was a rights issue given that all the music, including the iconic theme song, was redone by some band.  That didn't make sense though.  They full screen show us parts from the old cartoon during some segments.  Also Viacom owns everything now, why wouldn't they be able to show clips from the movie?  It's frustrating because they show things like cut footage and behind the scenes from the first film most people have never seen.  My only other guess is the quality wasn't that great so they shrunk it down to address that issue.

4.  Why isn't this longer?  At 98 minutes I'm baffled as to why they couldn't have fit in everything I'm talking about.  The Never Sleep Again doc made about the Nightmare franchise is over 4 hours long and features 2 hours of interviews that were cut from the final film.  Time is literally wasted at parts with awkward cut aways or holding on images for too long.  Why am I comparing TMNT to NOES?  Well TMNT is a much larger franchise with global recognition so why is it a niche horror franchise gets a better documentary then something as massive as Turtles?

5.  That brings me to my next point, where are the special features?  A lot of my complaints could have been addressed by the inclusion of special features.

6.  Why isn't this in HD?  Seriously where is the bluray?  Plus with a BR they could have had the space to include a lot of the things we wanted to see.

I honestly blame Paramount for all of these issues though and not the filmmakers.  They were the ones that most likely forced them to cut it shorter and didn't care to include bonus materials.  Their bare bones, and absolutely atrociously butchered, Turtles Forever DVD tells me they really don't give a crap.  For such a huge franchise a lot of the TMNT history is hard to find, even for hardcore fans, and more information/behind the scenes on the cartoons and movies would have been amazing.  Up until this the best chance you had of any behind the scenes on the first TMNT movie was a German DVD release that had commentary from the director and cut scenes.  No one has yet to put any of these materials on a US release and being that there's been so many it's rather frustrating.  Even more so to see that this stuff exists out there somewhere collecting dust in a vault.

Overall this movie pisses me off so much because these guys traveled the freaking country to get all these interviews.  I know they had hours and hours of great material.  They filmed a lot of stuff even hardcore fans like me haven't seen before.  I'm mad for them because I know how much hard work they put into this project.  Maybe one day we will get to see more of it but for now this is the best we can get.

So in conclusion a great TMNT Doc for those who want to educate themselves on the franchise but for hardcore fans there isn't a whole lot here you haven't seen before.  Still I love what it represents and had I not been ""in the know ""following this project for 6 years I might have less complaints.  Still a must have for any fan even if it's just to support the franchise.",1408752000,11,5146,4.391949152542373
6454115,5,B00KYQS6UG,"I pre-ordered this after going to the Thursdays panel at Comic-con 2014. I am a huge TMNT fan and love to hear the stories, trials, and thoughts of all who were involved in the development and growth of this cherished franchise.

It mainly discusses how Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman were introduced to each other and how they came up with and started the TMNT concept. As well as the start of Mirage Studios.

It does a fairly detailed overview of the original comic series, a bit of the Archie series, the Toy line, the first cartoon series, the original movie, and even the ""Coming out of Their Shell"" tour; with commentary from many who were involved.

I cant say this is the definitive history of TMNT because there is so much that was never discussed or just merely glanced over but I can say I did enjoy watching it.

A couple things I was disappointed in was at the panel they discussed a scene that was suppose to be at the end where Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman went back to the house they first started drafting TMNT and was reminiscing about their time there. The actual acene was a short scene with them merely walking by where the house used to stand.
I was also disappointed that their were no outtakes or extra features. I would love to see some of the 100 of hours of footage that never made the cut.

Watch it and enjoy",1408665600,3,1338,4.379032258064516

We got to see so much footage that could have been in the film (like the Stan Sakai interview, for example) that ended up not even appearing in the final cut.  I was fully prepared to forgive this, thinking it would show up in special features, but unfortunately there are no special features.  None. At all.

The material that did make it into the film was pretty informative, but the majority is stuff that, to a die-hard Turtle fan, is probably old news.  There is a part dedicated to the ""Coming Out of Our Shells Tour"" that was real neat. I didn't really know much about that part of the Turtles' history.  We also get to see some home video footage taken by Peter and Kevin back when they first started the comic.

As such, I feel he missed the point of this documentary and wanted something it never set out to do.  This is an in-depth, expansive look at the creation of the TMNT and what the property evolved into across television, cinema and toys.  It has some great interviews with both Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, as well as the supporting players that helped make this a global brand.

6454125,4,B00KYQS6UG,"Turtle Power is a documentary going over what they claim is the ""definitive history of the teenage mutant ninja turtles"", which I wouldn't say is completely true. This doesn't mean the movie is bad, because its actually very good.

The film focuses heavily on the creators of the turtles, the original comic book being started, the original cartoon series, the first live action movie, the merchandising, and the music tour. All of this is covered very well with interviews with the original creators, producers, actors and voice actors (seeing interview footage of James Avery choked me up a little), and other business people. Original sketches are shown, behind the scenes and test footage from the first movie, and so on.

The problem I had with the film is after talk about the first film and The Coming Out of Their Shells Tour happens, the film basically skips over the rest of the history of the franchise, jumping to present day and covers it in about 5 to 10 minutes. The second and third live action film are barely mentioned at all, the live action TV show The Next Mutation is not talked about, the 2007 animated film TMNT is not mentioned at all, the 2003 cartoon series is not mentioned at all, Turtles Forever is not mentioned at all, and nothing about the current 2012 cartoon series or the recently released 2014 live action/CGI movie. It is very disappointing that the history after the franchise's beginnings is breezed over so quickly. It felt like the film didn't care about anything but its origins. I understand the film wanted to primarily focus on the origins of the franchise, but having ""Definitive History"" in your film's title, I think its fair to assume more was going to be talked about. I know it would of added to the run time, but still.

A couple other setbacks: there are no special features whatsoever, and the movie is only available on DVD or digital download. A bluray would of been cool.

Overall, this is a very well done documentary and for any Turtle fan, it is a must own. Seeing where this franchise came from, what all the people involved with it have to say, its really a treat.",1407888000,25,2127,4.664

8662724,3,B00KYQS6UG,"I bought the streaming version of Turtle Power. It was great seeing Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, creators of the TMNT, telling their story through interview footage. But this documentary isn't as comprehensive as it should be.

The main appeal for me was learning more about the first Turtles movie, since Warner Bros has always refused to provide special features for it. The documentary doesn't have any real deleted scenes - just seconds of behind-the-scenes footage here and there. There is a nice bit where we see blurry VHS footage of Kevin Eastman playing a scared garbageman that unfortunately didn't make it into the film. No footage of Ginsu, I mean Tatsu killing the Foot Soldier or anything substantial.

Besides the first movie, Turtle Power provides quality information and interviews regarding the creation of the original Mirage comic, the Playmates toys licensing deal, the licensing (plus voice acting and a tiny bit on the writing) of the original cartoon series, the production of the first movie, and the production of the Coming Out of Their Shells tour.

But is it a good documentary as a whole? Let's look at its failings. The movie alludes to Peter and Kevin's break up, but provides exactly zero details over why they stopped being friends. Closest thing we get is the mention that Kevin had moved to the West Coast.

Turtle Power mentions the second and third Turtles films only in passing, which is a huge shame considering how the three movies were produced so close together and differ so greatly from each other. Nor do we get any mention of the CG film TMNT, the excellent 2003 animated series, the Nick series, the live-action TMNT: The Next Mutation series, or the videogames (other than a brief blurb about the NES game being too hard).

There are several brief interviews with fans that are completely extraneous compared to the actual TMNT topics that go unaddressed. The opening footage with crappy CGI of the TCRI canister falling could also have been excised in favor of providing more relevant information.

The movie ends with some quick footage of Kevin and Peter (who both look far older than in the actual interviews) reuniting to sign autographs at a convention. This is meant to play as an emotional moment, but it doesn't work because we don't understand their rift or how they came back together for the moment. We just see them signing stuff for fans, and that's it.

The end credits song has nothing to do with the Turtles and really sends the film out on a whimper. It would have been so much more appropriate to license TURTLE Power (even just MegaRan's cover or the techno version from TMNT: Out of the Shadows) - something that actually relates to the subject matter and would be enjoyed by fans.

I still recommend watching Turtle Power for the interesting information that it does provide. But I wish it either painted a more comprehensive picture of the Turtles or had the good sense to end after covering the first movie and stage tour without dangling other subjects in our faces that it has no interest in exploring.",1467676800,5,3079,4.818181818181818
