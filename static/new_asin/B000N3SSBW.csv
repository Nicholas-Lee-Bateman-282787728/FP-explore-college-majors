2754526,4,B000N3SSBW,"You have to admit the price for this Clint Eastwood Western Icon collection is hard to beat, but what you get is a bare-bones product. Three movies, two discs, and only the theatrical trailers as extras. Oh, you get them in another language if you want. I looked to see what other languages were offered on Two Mules For Sister Sara and was surprised to find that French rather than Spanish is the viewer's only alternative to English. There are no liner notes to speak of except for the rather simplistic one-sentence summaries of the movies on both the clamshell cover and it's protective box.
High Plains Drifter is one of the best Eastwood-acted and Eastwood-directed westerns. That he learned well from mentor Sergio Leone is quite apparent throughout. Though the setting is hardly in the high plains (looks like Mono Lake in the eastern Sierras to me), it is an ideal setting, both high and lonesome, for the saga that unfolds. If you watch and listen closely, you will notice that Eastwood's character is the incarnation of the spirit of a murdered marshal the townsfolk had heartlessly buried in an unmarked grave after arranging his being whipped to death in order to protect the interests of local businessmen. The marshal's spirit has a plan and the calculated way he takes his revenge is a delight to see! There are a few anachronisms in the film, see if you can pick them out.
Joe Kidd is on the same disc with High Plains Drifter. I'd never seen nor heard of it before but found it to be a powerful film. The story pits Anglo land-grabbers who have ""the law"" on their side against indigenous and Mexican residents of New Mexico who hold Spanish and Mexican land grants that pre-dated the Mexican war of 1848. The greediest of the Anglos will stop at nothing, even mass murder, to enforce their claims while dispossessed native land owners take up arms in desperate opposition since the territorial courts refuse to acknowledge their prior ownership. Though Eastwood was hired by the wealthy Anglos as a guide into the country where rebel leader Luis Chama and his band are holed up, his usual keen sense of justice has him turn on his employers when mass murder of unarmed peasants appears imminent. And that's where the fun begins. As with the preceding films, Joe Kidd contains a number of anachronisms. See if you can spot them.
Two Mules For Sister Sara takes us south of the border into the middle of the Juarista battle against the French interlopers who conquered Mexico in the mid-19th century. The action begins when Eastwood rescues a putative nun from a band of greasy would-be rapists and then learns she is on the run from the French as a Juarista spy. As it turns out, Eastwood has a deal with a Juarista colonel in which he stands to make a lot of money if he comes through. Eastwood's single-minded pursuit of money juxtaposed with the more other-worldly concerns of the ""nun"" make for a lot of comedy and a lot of action. The ending is a thriller! Those who appreciate the inventive sound-tracks of the early Clint Eastwood westerns should especially appreciate Ennio Morricone's unusually bleak, sun-baked compositions for this film.
It is important to remember that these films go far beyond mere shoot 'em up thrillers. For those who can look beyond the frissons of delight generated by the vengeful but judicious violence, there are a lot of issues raised that stimulate the intellect. Try to understand the lessons that Eastwood imparts while roaring with delight as each bad guy receives his condign punishment.
Since I liked all three movies a lot, I would give this set five stars were it not for the cheap production. Despite its drawbacks as a box set, I still recommend it highly for any who like Eastwood's style.",1221955200,14,3756,4.744648318042813
2754527,5,B000N3SSBW,I get these dvd's for my 17 year old grandson. He loves Clint Eastwood. Amazon is a great place to order movies. They are very prompt with their delivering.,1221609600,,156,4.413793103448276
2754528,4,B000N3SSBW,"I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood ---- and always will be ---- so naturally I just had to get this collection. This is basically a three-pack set containing three of his westerns from Universal Pictures: High Plains Drifter (1973), Joe Kidd (1972) and Two Mules for Sister Sara (1969), all of which are great films. The color and picture transfer for each is nice, complete with a high-quality anamorphic widescreen presentation. My only complaint against this set is a total lack of any extra features for any of the movies, save for a theatrical trailer for each. Other than that, there's no commentaries, no deleted scenes, no extra footage, no featurettes, not even so much as a scene selection option on the main menu. Even the original single-disc editions of these movies had that! The three movies are contained on 2 discs ; disc 1 contains 'High Plains Drifter' and 'Joe Kidd', while disc 2 contains 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' solo. All in all, I'm not disappointed at having gotten this collection ------ I'm glad to have it, but the complete absence of any extra features that would have enhanced the viewing experience is unfulfilling. These are good Clint Eastwood films but they deserved better, more thorough dvd treatment than they received here. One gets the impression that this collection was hastily assembled and released just to make a quick buck. This set still gets my postive endorsement, but just be advised that you will find nothing here other than the movies themselves.",1220227200,56,1499,4.882352941176471
2754529,5,B000N3SSBW,"I've always been a fanatic of Clint's movies.  While these aren't his most popular, they are a heck of a lot better than most westerns of that era.  Two Mules, with Shirley McClain, has a lot of humor on top of the first rate action.  Clint is about as cool as he can be in High Plains.  Joe Kidd is definitely a first rate western, although rarely seen on TV these days.  This is a great collection for Clint buffs.",1216771200,,416,4.15

2754532,4,B000N3SSBW,"All three movies have been digitally remastered, but unfortunately the sound wasn't.  Just the basic Dolby recording which is disappointing.

2754819,5,B000N3SSBW,"My wife and I like to watch movies late at night before we go to bed. Lately, we've been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood movies, including the Western Icon Collection. This set includes three real fine Eastwood movies: ""High Plains Drifter,"" Joe Kidd"" and ""Two Mules for Sister Sara."" I'm a geologist and I got a kick out of viewing ""High Plains Drifter"" in that it wasn't filmed in the High Plains at all but rather at Mono Lake in California. Joe Kidd was filmed in the foothills of the eastern Sierra Nevada near Lone Pine in California. Both settings appealed to me and I have visited them many times prior to even being aware of these movies.

A word of warning is due. All Clint Eastwood movies tend to be violent in one way or another. So many people are killed in this set it's hard to keep up with a body count. Add fist fights, beatings and miscellaneous mayhem. If this bothers you in any way, don't order this set and then complain. Personally, I have no objection as it's just action-packed fiction and makes for excitement and good story telling. Plus, the people biting the dust are generally really despicable characters. In a way, all the violence and the despicable heavies actually present somewhat humorous watching.

""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" is a rather unusual Eastwood movie. Here, Eastwood rescues a nun from three creeps who are about to do her no good. The nun was played by Shirley MacLaine. Well, after Eastwood and MacLaine reluctantly team up we gradually find out that she's a hard drinking, cigar smoking and foul mouthed Sister who's totally comfortable with blowing up a trainload of soldiers. The train destruction is spectacular, by the way. In any case, the tale ends up as something of a romance and makes for a rather delightful story.

This is an excellent set of DVDs, I'd rate each movie as five stars, and the whole packet is not only good but it's inexpensive.

2754842,4,B000N3SSBW,High plains drifter is clint as his best. Two mules is a very good movie and Joe Kidd had promise but was very cheesy..,1264291200,2,119,4.0
2754843,4,B000N3SSBW,"No extras just a bare bones compilation with one of Clint's finest westerns (HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER), one of his worst (TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA) and one in between (JOE KIDD).  Directed by Eastwood, Don Siegel and John Sturges they run the gamit.  DRIFTER is a stark and dark tale of revenge.  TWO MULES is based on a Budd Boetticher story (which Budd has wanted to direct) with MacLaine as a hooker helping the Mexican Revolution in the guise of a nun.  Yeah right. Clint is a mercenary in a film that has a Morricone score is definately meant to have the look and feel of a ""spagetti Western"".  JOE KIDD has legendary director John Sturges (MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE) at the helm, Robert Duvall and John Saxon in supporting roles.  It just doesn't have that something extra.  A standard film that could easily have been done for Randolph Scott or Audie Murphy.",1261612800,2,871,4.616883116883117
2754844,4,B000N3SSBW,"Clint Eastwood;  He is the MAN, always lots of action and good story lines, beautiful scenery and he's got that rough tough machismo way about him that few have plus he's got that witty, sly sense of humor. Eastwood would have made a great James Bond. These movies were tailor made for him, you won't be disappointed.",1257897600,2,317,4.56140350877193

2754846,3,B000N3SSBW,"I bought this set out of the discount bin at the local WalMart. I didn't notice it the first time I watched, but the second time I watched these, I noticed that the dialog had been edited to just blank out some curse words. The most blatant editing is on ""High Plains Drifter""... in six or seven places. And, I think Clint's sex scene in the barn has been shortened.

I am wondering if these sets are all like this, or was this just done for the Wally World soccer-mom crowd? I have heard that WaldoMart does this to other videos. True? If it's just on this set, than the set stinks. ""High Plains Drifter"" (originially released with an 'R' rating) was meant to be gritty.

Well, so much for the nanny state. Big Brother is watching out for you.",1240099200,14,744,4.307142857142857
