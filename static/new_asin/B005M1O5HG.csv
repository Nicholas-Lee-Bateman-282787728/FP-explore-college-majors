8678735,5,B005M1O5HG,"I can't believe nobody from America has bought this series, I live on the other side of the pond and grew up with Steve Austin, we always played 6 million dollar man, although I never got to see all the episodes I got to see most and I still remember them as if it were yesterday.
OK, so they haven't been digitally enhanced or anything but played on a Blu-Ray player the picture quality is outstanding.
I do however remember, the first episode I saw was the pilot and it wasn't Lee Majors, he came in on the second episode (now known as pilot), a little later his childhood sweetheart joins him and becomes the bionic woman (Hence we then called 6 million dollar man Bionic Man).
OK, now for pro's and con's...
Well picture quality is passable, it's better than VHS, it still has a few pops and crackles, and picture jumps fast in a couple of paces (before his bionics) but considering this series is over 40 years old I think it's bloomin' marvellous.
Colours are a bit vibrant at times, but hey, it's the 70's and colours were the rage (not as bad as 60's of course).  If you're into nostalgic programmes/films this is a must for you.
Good job they put the whole 5 seasons up for sale, thought they might have done a Seaquest special and held back a season or two (worse mistake they made with Seaquest holding back on Season 3, not really interested in that series now even though I can buy Illegal copies I won't bother, leaving it with just 2 seasons.
Now for the Con's
I can think of only one at this present moment, the price, the price varies from season to season, considering the age I think they should all be at the same price and it would be nice if the whole collection was sold for around $60.",1438560000,,1709,4.32398753894081
