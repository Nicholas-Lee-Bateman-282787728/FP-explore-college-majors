8087517,4,B000BJS4RQ,"Elpidio Valdes is, if I'm not mistaken, the first feature length film, released in 1979, from the virtually self-taught cartoonist and animator Juan Padron.  It's a patriotic and thrilling ride, following the struggles of Cuban independence fighters (mambis) to gain their independence from Spanish imperialists.  Leading the way is the charismatic father-son duo of Elpidio and Elpidio, and the film depicts a sort of changing of the guard as the new generation picks up the struggle for liberation and self-determination where the previous one left off.

Padron's style is simple but effective.  His cartoony characters are thinly drawn but richly portrayed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I appreciated how it subtly reminded me that the line between revolutionary hero and insurgent enemy is often a matter of perspective ... and representation.",1136246400,5,855,5.446969696969697
