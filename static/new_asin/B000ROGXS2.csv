8201992,5,B000ROGXS2,"Director Rob Rosen, takes you into unchartered waters-- inside the mind of the gambler-- and it's a pretty entertaining place!  I'm not a big gambler, but after meeting his cast of characters, I'm itching to head to the casino and put some money down. I'm betting that if you like to wager  you'll love this flick!",1181520000,,314,4.589285714285714
8201993,5,B000ROGXS2,"This is a powerful and well crafted documentary on several levels. First, and perhaps most importantly, it demistifies the world of gaming. It's a solid and insightful look inside the mind and heart of a gambler. Forget the glitz of Vegas or the grit of Atlantic City, we're treated to an insider's view of an ""average Joe"" out to score a few bucks. At times this doc is funny, other times quite sad. The gamblers and their emotions --both the highs AND lows-- arc this film back and forth between a psychological thriller and ""how to"" guide on beating the odds. Rob Rosen, in his first whack at directing, hits the jackpot!",1181520000,,624,4.580357142857143
8201994,4,B000ROGXS2,"There are no George Clooneys, Brad Pitts, babes or bright lights in this honest and fascinating look at the true face of the gambling industry, and ""Players: The Blue Collar Gambler"" is all the better for it. This gritty documentary strips all vestiges of glamour from the gambling world in portraying a few of the resourceful working stiffs who dedicate every day of their lives to taming the ""house."" Rosen has taken a clear-eyed but non-judgmental approach to the characters, allowing viewers to come to their own conclusions about the defiantly off-the-grid working life these guys have chosen. Highly recommended.",1181433600,,618,5.19
8201995,5,B000ROGXS2,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this doc, but it really gave me an inside view of gambling that was very interesting. The movie shows what it's like to ride the emotional rollercoaster of betting and the people it follows range from small everyday guys to big-time Vegas guys. The bottom line is, if you catch the gambling bug it doesn't matter who you are, you'll be hooked if you have that kind of personality. I'll definitely watch it again before my next time in Vegas. Maybe that way I can keep myself under control!",1181433600,,533,4.448979591836735
