8259620,5,B0015RCUWI,"A fascinating recreation of wartime conditions in China in the late 1930s.  The striking thing about this film, which bears some resemblances to blockbuster war movies like The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, and A Bridge Too Far, is that it was produced by studios working for the Communists but generally depicts Nationalist generals and their men as heroes--at least insofar as the fight against the Japanese was concerned.  Today this might seem conventional enough, but when this film first came out, it was a strking innovation.",1443312000,,536,5.149425287356322
