What can you say.  A great concept, great acting, and most of all beautiful cinematography. A great transfer to blu ray.
I see they are going to make a season two, I hope that it will be available on blu ray also.",1403481600,,389,3.8987341772151898

5731567,5,B00COU1I2S,"This a stunning and very disturbing show, if you are open minded and tired of the constant rehashed garbage on US TV or you like Nordic Noir like ""The Girl Who..."", ""Wallander"", the Danish version of The Killing you will love this. The Brits have always made great conspiracy shows,  House of Cards, A Coup Most British etc.

Even though I'm an ""Ugly American"" :), I have to agree with the other 2 UK reviewers, this is show that will stay with you for years.
The acting is superb, the music sound track is FANTASTIC, the art direction and cinematography are superb.

This is not for everyone though, if you can sit through The X Factor or Dancing with the Stars without wanting to vomit this is definitely NOT for you.

5731568,5,B00COU1I2S,"Glad to see that this incredible series has made it over the water. First broadcast on UK's Channel 4, we sat glued to the set through all six episodes. A warning though, this is a UK-brand of raw, & it's quite disturbingly violent at times. But its  a fantastically constructed story, with a tension that just builds and builds. It's beautifully shot as well, lots of wide angle panoramics that actually make some of the most depressing parts of Britain quite attractive, plus a great (if slightly quirky) soundtrack. Superb young cast (look out for the black guy from Misfits - another Channel 4 cult series, and have fun trying to make sense of the strong Welsh accent) plus some stellar performances from die-hards James Fox & Stephen Rae. A (rough) diamond.",1378771200,8,762,4.7727272727272725
5731569,5,B00COU1I2S,"a truly post modernist take on conspiricy theories, gripping from episode one it was compulsive viewing I caught the first episode on catch up until Virgin took it off, so any recordings, video or DVD, please let me know. THe largely unkown actors (pleae forgive me if you'r one) will surely have fame thrust upon them.",1371945600,7,319,4.714285714285714
8584141,5,B00COU1I2S,"Very, very, very cool show.  Conspiracy theory, sometimes gets a little crazy, but well paced, good acting, and overall a fantastic show.",1482364800,,137,5.2272727272727275
8584142,5,B00COU1I2S,"Amazing television show. Tops my favorite list. From cinematography to plot, this is one hell of a ride. Upset there is no Season 2 Blu-Ray.",1482105600,,140,4.64
8584143,5,B00COU1I2S,"Best tv show I have ever seen!
So tired of special effects, formulaic plot lines and impossibly beautiful people. This show has none of that. This show is so clever and intriguing on all fronts. The writing, acting, videography and soundtrack come together in a perfect harmony seldom seen. Lightning in a bottle! Must see!!!",1455148800,,325,4.927272727272728

8584145,5,B00COU1I2S," spoiler-free comments 
I'm beginning to think the Brits are one step ahead of us. First I find out that there will be an American remake of the UK's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mirror/dp/B00FKGOQWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mirror</a>, and now I hear HBO will be making their own version of Utopia. This is not to mention some older shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B00CEYPUAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>, which was rebooted by the Canadians.

Although not 100% original (it's a revamped secret agent template), Utopia does wonderfully well with the idea of a conspiracy theory so big that it will change humanity forever. This vastness contrasts nicely with the protagonists of the show, a very small but diverse group mostly drawn together by [what else?] the Internet. The troupe, which includes two child actors, were well cast (you'll recognize a couple of the adults if you watch enough UK television).
As the season progresses, viewers may be thrown into a bit of a conundrum about who to identify with (as more is revealed about each character and allegiances waver). Like life, Utopia is not black and white.

Excellence in television requires more than the visuals: it also requires appropriate audio (remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B008CN08ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>?)
Utopia's incidental music produces an effect as profound as The Imperial March (yet is absolutely nothing like the music of John Williams), almost serving as an additional character.

Negatives? Hmm, let me think. There is some graphic gun violence, which may put some viewers off. It's not a family show. Conversely, it's difficult to say enough good things about Utopia.",1434758400,,1873,6.358267716535433
8584146,4,B00COU1I2S,"ok, sounds amazing but how can i watch in US? it's Blue Ray and will not work on Sony or Panasonic ? sorry for posting a ""silly"" question & not a review here ...  i need to go buy a new Blue Ray player ?:((",1412467200,,206,3.577777777777778
8584147,1,B00COU1I2S,"This review has nothing to do with the content, which I am eventually looking forward to viewing.

However this disk WILL NOT WORK in the most popular Blu-Ray player on Earth, namely the PS3. To release a disc that ignores this basic platform is ridiculous.",1409529600,4,257,4.711111111111111

8584149,5,B00COU1I2S,"Sheer brilliance from start to finish, visually stunning, sharp and clear in its writing, this is the show that makes things like Breaking Bad second best... um... at best. A stylish bit of what sci-fi desperately needs: a cutting edge, a concept that smells like satire but burns like Tabasco. Not for the faint, this is the sort of thing that needs a group binge watch.",1407110400,,371,4.636363636363637
8584150,5,B00COU1I2S,"OK, so it's utterly ridiculous to write a review when you've only seen the first three episodes of a series, but OH MY FREAKIN' GaD, my my my OH MY, this is one beautiful and hypnotizing show. I don't think I've ever been more excited to embark on a journey with a series. By late second episode, a voice in my head was already shouting, ""Wow! Best show EVER!"" Every single character, shot, thread of storyline, visual and audio detail and nuance (my gad, the colors! the powerful atmospheric music and sounds!), etc, are just fantastically done. Seems like there is not a wasted second or gesture throughout. Of course it's way too early for me to say how good it will ultimately be, but this visual, intellectual, and sensory feast promises just SO much. Reminds me of a time when this now jaded former film buff believed in film as art. Of course it still exists as such, but over the years, with all the crap and utter garbage that one has had to swim through, it's easy to forget.

Yeah, this might not be for everyone, but anyone intrigued by super smart tight writing of a layered story that just unfolds and spirals and grows with mystery and shock, anyone who appreciates awesomely beautiful cinematography and razor sharp artful editing, anyone who loves great characters brilliantly portrayed, anyone who loves creativity unbounded and imagination delving deeper and deeper into rarer and rarer territories yet all seamlessly weaved together and executed on screen, anyone who enjoys a bit of a challenge and rapt sensory engagement instead of mere empty calories entertainment, well, this series might just be for you. Can't remember the last time I saw a film or series where you feel like every single component of the art is so masterfully handled. I'm more than just impressed by how good this is, I am moved AND seriously excited. I CANNOT WAIT to dig in, let go, and just lose myself in the rest of this series.

Do yourselves a big favor and CHECK THIS OUT!

Cheers!

Quick update (one day later): Just finished season one. AAAAAHHHHH!!! The show gets even better (how's that even possible?! ha ha) as it progresses and you follow further and further down the rabbit hole. Wow! This is one special work. So glad I stumbled onto it. Naturally, I'm going to check out the new season. Or maybe I'll wait for it to be completed so I can watch it all in one binge session, hee.",1406073600,5,2391,4.632075471698113
