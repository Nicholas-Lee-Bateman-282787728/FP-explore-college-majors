Over the year I had herd about this band and I'm sorry to say I didn't pay them any mind at all. That was until I looked them up on YouTube a couple of month ago. They have two real good videos on there and I was blown away. So I did a search here at amazon and found this four disc set. I listen to the cd's first and had to play it more than once the day I received it. A couple of day later I watched the Dvd and was not disappointed.
 If you like The Grateful Dead you will like Dark Star Orchestra. I've seen two other cover bands in my life that really hit the note they were Rain a tribute band to the Beatles and ZoSo the tribute band to Led Zeppelin.

 Tracks: Promised Land, Sugaree, Mama Tried, El Paso, Tennesse Jed, Looks Like Rain, Deal, Lazy Lightning, Fennario, The Music Never Stopped, Bertha, Estimated Prophet, Scarlet Begonias, Transition Jam I, Fire on the Mountain, Good Lovin', St Stephen, Sugar Magnolia, Johnny B Goode. Sadly Truckin, Eye's of the World or U.S. Blues were not among the song selected for this show back 2004. I paid $28.00 plus $3.99 for shipping I'm sure I might have found it cheaper on the bands website but I feel I got my money's worth.

I hope this helps you... Peace - Rick Glenn",1395792000,3,1377,4.146067415730337
