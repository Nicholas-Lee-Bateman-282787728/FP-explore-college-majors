8146506,1,B000INBF8K,"I have to agree with the other reviewer of this item.  This DVD is a dud.  At least with other motorcycle documentary-style videos there is an evident theme, such as being at one of the major rallies and so forth.

There is no evident theme to this video.  As the other reviewer said, it's like someone took a video camera and just walked around some rather empty-looking custom bike shows.  If you listen long enough to what people are saying on the video you may be able to figure out that these are loosely connected shots from one or more tours sponsored by Easy Rider magazine and that the video is highlighting some of their ""centerfold' bikes.  But there is no narration or anything that really makes that connection for you.

I don't know why they have those girls on the cover of the DVD.  They are nowhere to be found (no are any others like them) on the DVD itself.

Overall, a waste of time and money.",1188950400,4,913,4.386904761904762
8146507,1,B000INBF8K,"This appears to be amateur video of walking around deserted custom bike shows, the drag strips, and very little else.  No story, nothing to be learned, no insights into anything.  A total waste of time & money.",1167264000,3,210,4.648648648648648
