Terrific animation and the behind-the-scenes documentary features on the discs were neat to watch too - especially since it was the director's first series and he's gone on to make much more popular series since.",1438732800,,335,4.758620689655173
8124602,5,B000FKPE1K,"The artbox or better yet the collectors boxset is nicely done with some nice artwork all around. I already had this set once before but sold it in great condition and the discs weren't even used cause I watched the series off the litebox set I had. Unfortunately I wanted the box set in mint condition with the original manufacturing wrap around it. I know ""silly"" but I bought it at a nice price and I'm happy with it.",1378339200,,419,4.3164556962025316
8124603,4,B000FKPE1K,"The series is about Rushuna Tendo who is trying to reach the capital in search for her master.  During the way back, she meets up with Yajiro and they team up together to venture back to the capital and along the way they are met with strong opponents who intend to block them from moving closing to their destination.

First of all, Rushuna is a very unique anime character since she uses a classic revolver (6 bullets per round) and in order to replenish her bullet supply, she uses her breasts to do it.  With that said, there is a lot of fanservice in this anime (though there is actually no Nudity) and most of the fanservice is made by Rushuna.  You are going to watch this anime for the following reasons:

1. Fanservice
2. Action

Those are the only reasons why you are watching this series.  The action can be ridiculous, but it is explained thoroughly and that is the reason why I gave it such a high score.  Unlike other animes which tend to drag on with the explanation or the battles themselves, each battle is decided  in good time and there are explanations to how each battle was resolved.  One last thing, there is no real violence displayed in the anime as each battle Rushuna wins is through a method of ""non-violence"" (those who have already watched the series will know what I'm talking about and for those who haven't will need to watch to understand)

Recommended for those who are into Action Anime.",1201824000,,1423,4.498054474708171

In a world set in feudal Japan where the honorable sword is being crushed by the advent of the firearm, warlords rule. In order to bring peace, a traveler by the name of Rushuna defeats her enemies by removing their will to fight. Hohoemi no Senshi::The Smiling Senshi

Accompanied by a mercenary samurai and a balloon maker's daughter, Rushuna meets many obstacles on her journey. There are ruthless enemies with magnificent weapons, but between her ""take your adversary to your breast"" attitude and her six shooter that reloads with a bounce of her bountiful bosom, she might just bring peace to her country.

A little bit of skin, big boobs, and very well done action scenes. My favorite part about this anime is its ""make love not war"" philosophy.

This was a must have for my collection and I got a great deal (under 30) from DVDPlanet. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys ecchi, action, and story.

The cons are that the series is short for a ""complete boxed set"" price tag and sometimes the character development is based more on stereotypes than deep underwriting. However, great English voicework (though I prefer to sub rather than dub anyway) and a positive energy soundtrack are pluses for an otherwise easy to overlook series.",1185753600,,1487,5.392241379310345
