8404630,5,B003SPLQ0W,This was a brilliant dvd and provided me with much pleasure listening to it and watching Barenboim play as well as directing the orchestra.  Wonderful!,1428451200,,151,5.04
8404631,5,B003SPLQ0W,"Berenboim conducting from the piano plays the five Beethoven piano concerti. Excellent sound, excellent inyerpretation, and tasteful video. These performances are so good that they push almost every other interpretation off the plate.",1365379200,3,234,6.121212121212121
8404632,5,B003SPLQ0W,"... no words. Perfect, power, beauty, poetic and it's Beethoven. The piano concerto's are Beethoven's heart (and his symphonies, his soul (buy them too)) Buy everything Beethoven! Barenboim is the perfection of Beethoven.",1355529600,5,221,5.7272727272727275
8404633,5,B003SPLQ0W,"These performances of Daniel Barenboim leading his ensemble, Staatskapelle Berlin, from the piano are from the Jahrhunderthalle in Bochum, Germany in May 2007.  This is an industrial-looking venue, which didn't really seem to fit the music.  Regardless, the performances are terrific.  Barenboim conducts and plays beautifully.  A slow push in on 3:I shows intensity in Barenboim's profile, and a close up of his hands on 3:II accentuates his virtuosity.

The cameras on stage are unobtrusive, and the visuals are crisp.  The sound is clean, and the strings in particular have a very warm sound.  Highly recommended.",1343606400,6,616,5.354166666666667
