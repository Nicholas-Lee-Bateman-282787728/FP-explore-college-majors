8222544,4,B000WC8C3I,"The reason i picked this up is because i am a fan of hardcore fighting,mixed martial arts & weapons. Pretty much straight up street fight. But let me tell you,i have no idea who most of these guys are,the only people i know of is the Necro-Butcher & another dude that went under a different name before but now is called something else(i forgot exactly who,but he winds up winning the entire competition & he's wearing a Goatwhore shirt)
so i was rooting for him or Necro to get the win. The entire match set up is similar to WWF/WWE style Royal Rumble meets King of the Ring,the show starts with 19 people in an over the top rope style match. The first 3 men eliminated get to leave the event before the brutal matches,because the first  3 to get eliminated are done for the night. Then the next 4 people over the ropes are involved in a kendo stick match(4 guys,2 sticks) after that the following 4 people that get eliminated move on to the tables tournament. The next 4 over the ropes are involved in a ladder match & light bulbs tied to the ropes,44 light tubes in all. Then the last 4 guys in the ring after the first 15 people get eliminated those last 4 guys in the ring advance to the barbed-wire match. Then 4 matches play out,1st is the kendo stick match with 4 guys and 2 sticks. The winner advances to the final match(a cage match with the winner from each of the 4 matches to a final battle,with each winner from each of those 4 hardcore matches. Match 1 i do not know the name of the winner but he gets a pinfall and advances to the cage match. Hardcore match #2 is a tables match,where the last person to not go through a table wins the match and goes on to the cage match. The tables match is more hardcore than the kendo stick match,lots of nasty falls and crazy jumps into the crowd off the ropes. The winner of the tables match is named Drunk Adam & he advances to the final match(cage match). Match #3 of the hardcore battles is insane & downright violent(what i enjoy most) where 4 men battle it out with flourescent light tubes tied to the ropes & somebody needs to be able to climb the ladder then get the briefcase in which they advance to the cage match as well. This match is brutal,with everyone trying not to get irish whipped into the buckles turning into broken glass bulbs all over your body. Everyone just starts whacking each othwr with the tubes of lighting across the back,across the face,ontop of the head,across the midsection & even a low blow with busted glass. They wind up using the shattered stumps of light to cut into & carve each other up big time. There is also some chair action and 2 ladders get destroyed completely by being thrown into people & suplexes onto the ladders just bending the steps,1 guy gets a neckbreaker thru the ladder rungs & the back of his head bounces off it so hard i am suprised he isn't dead. The winner of
that match is Necro butcher & he advances to the final cage
match. Match #4 hardcore is wrapped barbed wire baseball
bats,barbed wire on these squared & rectangular pieces of plywood wrapped with barb wire. This match is nasty,just as violent as the match before it with ladders & lightbulbs. There is 1 guy that goes through a table ""The Devil's Bunkbed"" wrapped in barb-wire and stuffed with tubes of lighting stacked together inbetween 2 tables. The winner of the barb wire match advances to the final match of the night,the cage match. Now the final cage match is insane because the winners of the previous 4 hardcore matches get to bring in the weapon they had in the match they were in(a kendo stick,a table,flourescent glass tubes & a barb
wire baseball bat) and this match is insane because all of these
guys have been involved in viciously hardcore matches
previously in the 1 & 1/2 hours it has been since it started. But
the cage match was suprisingly good because these guys all had
alot of pain to endure to get this far. So the final 4 meet in a
cage,Necro Butcher,Drunk Adamn,the winner from the kendo
stick match(who's name i don't know) and another guy i don't
know who won the barb wire match. Those 4 face off in the cage
 & just beat the crap out of each other,but the winner of the cage
match was the winner of the ladder&lightbulb match. The guys
name i don't remember but like i said i picked him as the winner
from the start cuz of his Goatwhore shirt(a New Orleans metal
band) or Necro Butcher. If you remember right you will notice
that Necro Butcher was the guy that had a hardcore match
against Mickey Rourke in the movie The Wrestler. And yes Necro Butcher uses his staple gun in these matches,it is violent.
All in all if you are looking for ECW inspired bloody gory matches that are straightforward hardcore matches then this is a dvd you most likley will enjoy. I give it 4 stars just because i have seen prior hardcore dvds from other companies that shine  a bit more. I had an old XPW dvd that was probably the most brutal thing i have ever seen but it's gone,somebody stole it from me & i have yet to remember what it's called. The stuff is pretty good but if you want more memorable stuff try to find old ECW stuff. TNA is actually stepping up & outshining WWE. I stopped watching wrestling after Wrestlemania 20 but every now & again i'll see Jeff Hardy on TNA doing some insane stuff & i kinda got back into hardcore style fighting. Forget WWE & that CM Junk & watch some REAL hardcore fights.",1436227200,2,5411,4.366071428571429
8222545,5,B000WC8C3I,i gave it a 5 star cause i like wrestling i would recommend this to any real wrestling fan to see.,1401235200,,98,3.7142857142857144
