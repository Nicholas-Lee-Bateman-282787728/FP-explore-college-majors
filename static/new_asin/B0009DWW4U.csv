8078562,5,B0009DWW4U,"Harvey Mackay's SWIM WITH THE SHARKS WITHOUT BEING
EATEN ALIVE is one of my all-time favorite books on
marketing . . . it so impressed me that I have since read and
enjoyed every other book written by the author.

So imagine my delight when I got hold of HARVEY MACKAY LIVE,
a DVD of his best tips on outselling, outmanaging, outmotivating,
and outnegotiating your competition . .. it captures him in front
of a live audience, and does he ever drive his points in both
an engaging and informative fashion.

Among the many ideas that I gained from viewing were these:
* Set your standards as high as Lou Holtz. And measure your
performance very day.

* They're predicting every college graduate will have 3-5 career changes.

* Even if you're doing something, can you improve on what you're doing?

* People don't care about how much you know about them. They care
about how much you care about them.

* You want to know what turns your customer on, which is just
one of 66 things you should know about your customers.

* You must humanize your selling skills.

* The best kept secret in the world is Toastmasters International.

* It's the people you don't fire who make your life miserable.

* Every person you meet goes into your Rolodex file. Then find
a creative way to keep in touch.

* Our lives change in two ways: People we meet and books we read.

* Knowledge doesn't become power it is used.

And lastly, there's this one--one that I often cite:
* If I gove you a dollar, and you give me a dollar, we each have a dollar.
But if I give you an idea, and you give me an idea, we each have two ideas!

That said, I'm confident that you'll get a lot more than two ideas if you obtain
HARVEY MACKAY LIVE . . . best of all, it's accompanied by a
free CD if you want to listen to it while driving or exercising.",1191801600,2,1813,4.2631578947368425
8078563,2,B0009DWW4U,"I enjoy Harvey Mackay's books but this DVD was a letdown. The title created an expectation of many useful strategies to ""outsell, outmotivate & outnegotiate"" my competitors. What I found was a mix of common sense ideas, semi-interesting anecdotes, cute stories, along with some good useful advice. With a 48 minute runtime, there's no need for fluff and filler. I expected a barrage of valuable ideas that I could apply in my own business.

One of Harvey's ideas is to never be boring or predictable. Ironically, many (all?) of the examples he recites on the DVD were taken from his previous writings. If the DVD material is recycled from his books, then it should have been titled ""The Best of Harvey MacKay"".

In fairness, this is the first Harvey MacKay product that I did not like. Had I not previously read any of his books, I may have given this DVD 3 stars, but no more.",1170720000,,877,4.615384615384615
