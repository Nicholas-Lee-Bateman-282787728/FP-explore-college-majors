everything was copied even down to the repair work due to flak damage, the Boeing logo on the control yoke and even
the rudder peddles! To learn more about the B-29/Tu-4 click to ww2db.
Lessons learned for the U.S. Never ever underestimate an enemy. Last Tu-4s retired in the 1960s with over 800 produced.",1414540800,,426,4.77027027027027
8289507,5,B001CU7KHI,"The History Channel's DVD Stealing The Superfortress is an extremely interesting story telling how Reds managed to make the exact copy of sequestrated american B-29 strategic bomber in meagre two years and put it in full production as Tu-4 bomber. If you are in the position to swallow the relatively high price of a.m. DVD, you will be rewarded with the abundance of interesting informations on Russian technical achievement that have been mostly unpublished until today.",1240272000,,472,5.223684210526316
