7015350,5,B00TPN7DJ4,"Excellent but be forewarned - it's not about Hubble's photographs, it's about the accomplishment of putting that incredible telescope into space. What it does have is the Hubble story told by the people who built, launched, and repaired it in orbit, with stunning photography.  (It does briefly show some of the images.)

My DVD case of this video said ""Bonus Program: Hubble's Amazing Universe"" but that's not included - shame on NatGeo for stating that.  That's the DVD you want if you want to see the Hubble images.",1447632000,7,518,4.863636363636363
7015351,5,B00TPN7DJ4,"An excellent DVD on Astronomy by National Geographic. I hope to watch it over Christmas, since this is a Christmas gift this year.",1446249600,,130,4.695652173913044

7015356,5,B00TPN7DJ4,"It has more science details than the NOVA version of Hubble's accomplishments, but it's a few years older.  I enjoyed both this and the NOVA version.  My disc has two programs- Hubble's Cosmic Journey and, I think, Hubble's Amazing Universe.",1434499200,,241,5.0
7015357,5,B00TPN7DJ4,"This is a very informative documentary about human accomplishment especially by those geniuses in NASA who have gathered all the knowledge offered through the eyes of HST as well as giving human race a window to possibly examine where we may be from by building and repairing HST in the space. Mr. Hubble envisioned the idea of the journey decades ago and with NASA we get to see what it takes to go to space and repair HST, the human eye to this incredible journey. In 1990, Hubble was sent into orbit but hits a snag upon deployment. Three years NASA mounts a rescue mission to fix the flaw. American ingenuity at its best.",1433116800,,625,4.491228070175438
8702547,3,B00TPN7DJ4,"""Cosmic Journey"" sounds like a trip around the universe through Hubble's eyes, doesn't it? Wrong. Unless you are a gizmo geek who would just love to find out the provenance of this big eye in the sky, don't buy it.",1498176000,,214,4.375
