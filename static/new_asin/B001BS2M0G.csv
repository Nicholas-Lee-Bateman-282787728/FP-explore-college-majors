3497914,5,B001BS2M0G,"I am currently reading a biography of Valentino and I am also watching his films for the first time. This was a pleasant surprise. For a very early silent film (1922), it is lengthy at 1:40 but it never drags and moves along at a brisk pace. Valentino is wonderful here (you will have to overlook the silly hairstyle). I actually thought his performance here was better than ""The Sheik"".) Nita Naldi is good as the man-killer Dona Sol, despite some hammy expressions in her first scene. A beautiful musical score enhances the film. Very good quality (not sure why it alternates between sepia and b&w), the image is sharp and well preserved.",1433289600,,640,4.672566371681416

3497917,3,B001BS2M0G,"I think people get blinded by names....Oooh Rudolph Valentino.... It was O.k. and that's it. The movie was really predicable and early on at that.

The story a YOUTH wants to fight bulls, become a great bullfighter and be everyone's hero...like baseball players are like here...they do nothing productive and become idols who knows' why? Then you have this somber side track of a man writing about people and even his comments are predictable, or more exactly, predict the outcome. And as if that isn't enough they depict the ending on the back of the box!  Even the music is a giveaway...if music can do that. Even in the happy scenes of the movie they had the same dull monotonous depressing music over and over....you wouldn't even play it for background music, I mean unless you were depressed to begin with. AND... The music was rehashed: I've heard the same music on other videos from this company.

I might say I've had no problems loading this companies videos on my $10. DVD player... so I do intend to buy more from this company as they have a catalog on every video to pick titles from (at least 150-200 or so) . It's nice to have this Silent, but it was somewhat dull and like I say predictable. A small perk was the show was contemporary with the time (1922) so even though the outdoor scenes were all pretty much country or small town/house scenes, there were old cars used, and some neat out door shots of places. But even the acting was poor, and In fact everyone acted so lamely or with complete lack of imagination, I have to assume this was the directors fault. Campy to the max. As if that isn't bad enough, not even any bonus stuff... just the movie. The box says 78 Minutes. I think it was a hour and 26 or so minutes, so that is a bit out, so you get more dullness for your money...THERE'S a bonus!",1421884800,,1821,4.429850746268657

3497921,5,B001BS2M0G,This is a classic.  Valentino can show more emotion in a single look than most actors today can do in a lifetime.,1396915200,,113,4.136363636363637
3497922,1,B001BS2M0G,complete disappointment. I thought I am buying the right blood and sand movie starring Tyron Power but really screwed myself with this one. If you look my account I have two copies of Blood and sand. I could not transfer to my Kindle fire. that is why I bought this to download digitally from amazon. really disaster.,1391385600,,317,4.578947368421052
3497923,5,B001BS2M0G,It was a great movie I loved it. Rudolph  Valentino is the greatest actor ever.  He is great in all his movies.,1381622400,,111,4.0
3497924,5,B001BS2M0G,"I write about:""Blood&sand-Kino video-deluxe collector's edition-2001""-dvd. This's a color tinted version. Quality:very good. You can find some supplemantal features that you can read about on the front of its package. I like the soundtrack because its sound seems to me old like the movie or near. On the back side of its package you find a photograph about Rodolfo during the dressing room scene,but on this version this part of this scene has been cut...damn! I'm a silent movies collector and I hoped find here the whole scene...I hope someone can tell me where I could find it !!! Hilarious is the scene when the Moor servant offers to light Valentino's cigarette,here we found the comic side of Rodolfo,it makes me remember the ""All night"" movie with a comic Rodolfo's acting. In this role I find a lot of Italian soul in Rodolfo's acting,and I can understand the why he loved this movie so much,especially when Rodolfo plays the poor young Juan he seems very much like the young boys of Southern of Italy;here in Italy we call one of them them ""Guaglione""with the Southern Italian slang of Naples,it traslates as ""a back street boy"" or ""corner boy"" or ""urchin"",the word guaglione has appeared as ""wallyo"" in the New York immigrant slang. I adore the scene where the poor young Juan has some troubles with his old mamy and when he sees his mamy cry he suffers and he tries to make amends...how real this scene must have seemed to Rodolfo,recalling his mother ! Kino has done a good job,I'm happy about this purchase,malefica from Italy.",1380844800,,1541,4.796992481203008
3497925,5,B001BS2M0G,"I so enjoyed ""Blood and Sand"".

I've read this was Valentino's favorite film, although he did not like the use of stock footage of actual bullfights in Spain interwoven in the film (he had wanted the movie done on location) but the studios wanted to save money.

I have to say that the use of the stock footage was a distraction (I have to think even back in 1922 it was a distraction).

One minute you are looking at a grainy picture of a packed-to-the rafters arena somewhere in Spain, and then you are transported to another ""arena"" featuring nice comfy seats and having a much crisper image.

But, just when you think it looks so phony, there is Rudy (the first method actor?) making it all look so real!  He's making all the real bullfighter moves, he's decked out precisely like the real item - he's even gesturing to excite the crowd.

Even the final scene was done so realistically.",1346112000,,890,4.496894409937888
3497926,5,B001BS2M0G,There is only one Rudolf Valentino and there will never be another like him. I am so grateful that we have (thanks to film restorers) DVD's of his work.  Blood and Sand is one of his most famous (after The Sheik and The Son of The Sheik) but I think his absolute best is The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. If you have never seen his work I am happy to say that Amazon carries all of them.,1298592000,,390,4.0
3497927,5,B001BS2M0G,"I have just taken an interest in silent movies and really enjoyed this one.
It is unfortunate that Rudolph Valentino died in his early 30's
Another great movie he stars in is Beyond The Rocks which was a lost movie for over 60 years until a copy was found and restored in 2005.
Blood and Sand was remade and released in 1941 starring Tyrone Power and both versions of this movie are powerful",1292544000,,391,4.36986301369863
3497928,5,B001BS2M0G,This is an excellent old film with the one and only Rudoph Valentino. Good quality dvd as well.,1283040000,,95,4.333333333333333
3497929,3,B001BS2M0G,"This DVD is far superior to the Netflix one, which has an absolutely ghastly musical score. The Kino DVD has a wonderful score and some very charming and excellent scenes that are missing from the Netflix one.

There was just one problem: the back cover showed a picture of Juan Gallardo during the famous dressing room scene. It was the moment when the valet was wrapping the sash around his waist. The presence of this photo gives the impression that the dressing room scene is on the DVD in its entirety. But when you watch the movie, the scene has been significantly truncated, and the sash scene is missing.

This is a signature scene that is very hard to find nowadays, and for a serious film collector, it would be nice to see this scene uncut. I don't think it's right to create a package that does not honestly reflect the DVD's contents, or to give the impression that certain features are included in a movie, when in fact they are not.",1269129600,,947,4.5
3497930,4,B001BS2M0G,"Blood and Sand is not your soppy romance from the 1920's, with gushing expressions and rolling eyes.  This is a hard, biting movie about a bullfighter that becomes too engross in his own personal fame that he forgets what is most dear to him.  Well written and directed, Valentina comes across as this arrogant bullfighter that you love in the beginning, learn to hate, then love again.  His acting is superb and the camera shots, for the time, are excellent.",1249430400,,459,4.7125
3497931,5,B001BS2M0G,"This is such an incredible movie, at least as good as any movie of today.  People who complain that silent movies are boring or obsolete clearly haven't watched any or seen an incredible one like this.  There are enough periodic text blocks on the screen to convey what's going on or what someone just said to follow along just fine, and the rest of the time yoiu can follow along by watching the interactions between the characters, facial expressions, and body language.  Some silent movies may be overacted, but this one isn't; maybe people of today have just forgotten how to process emotions and a story through nonverbal channels, or what a truly expressive face looks like.

This was the first Valentino movie I saw, and now I like him even more.  He looks even more beautiful in motion than he does in still pictures, and you can appreciate that he was more than just a stunningly beautiful face.  So many modern-day actors don't have faces that are that expressive, nor can they convey emotions like tenderness, lust, sensuality, sexuality, anger, shock, surprise, etc., through their body language and other nonverbal cues.  The wedding night scene, when Juan goes to find the nervous Carmen, holds her from behind, and sweeps his hand out, is incredibly erotic; I find it much more thrilling than a graphic sex scene.  The brooding sexuality and all that's left unsaid and undone leaves so much more to the imagination, and being as old-fashioned as I am, I feel that less is truly more.  The scene where he gets down on his knees and begs Carmen for forgiveness as he holds her and rests his head against her side is also very tender and moving.  And so much of the character he plays wasn't acting; he really was that caring, gentle, tender, emotional, loving, and passionate in real life.  His heart and soul were just as beautiful as his face.

The ending is incredibly powerful, emotional, and chilling as well.  The whole movie stays with you for a long time.  They really don't make movies or actors like that anymore.",1101945600,,2036,4.714689265536723
3497932,5,B001BS2M0G,"The quality of this film (or at least the version I purchased) did not seem to be to the standards of other Valentino films (picture seemed grainy and the speed seemed much faster), but I still rate it among one of the best.  Like one review wrote, it does lack the style of the later Tyrone Power remake; however, Power comes nowhere close to Valentino's brooding, sensual portrayal of Juan Gallardo, and Nita Naldi was much more convincing as the witchy Dona Sol than Rita Hayworth, and plays the range of emotions (from begging Gallardo to love her to coldly reacting to his death)extremely well.  This 1922 version captures the spirit of the bullfight remarkably well in spite of the limitations of silent film-making, and seemed incredibly authentic.
Now - about Valentino.  I was puzzled at the over-emphasized eyebrows and wish the make-up artists had not found it necessary to use the effect, as Valentino would have projected a Spanish image easily with his natural dramatic looks alone.  But, either way, he is intensely sexy, powerful, brooding, smoldering and hypnotic as usual.  I enjoyed his portrayal of the youth Juan, especially his tenderness toward his mother.  His transition from youth to adult matador was natural and believable.  The scene in which Dona Sol begs him to love her and proclaims that she longs for him to ""beat"" her with his ""strong"" hands was highly erotic and was packed with a sexual tension that can't be matched by anyone other than Valentino and his leading ladies.  I may be biased, because I am crazy about any vehicle which showcases Rudolph Valentino; however, this film carries its own and I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Once again, Valentino has captured my heart, and I recommend this film to all lovers of romance.",1017792000,,1782,4.874172185430464
3497933,5,B001BS2M0G,"I think this is the best film Valentino ever did! His acting in the romantic scenes lacks the over the top feel that the loves scenes in ""The Sheik"" have. He brings a sincere, believeable quality to the character. Also, something that the reviews here seem to miss is the comedic moments in the film. In the scene when the black Moor servant offers to light Valentino's cigarette... the look on his face is priceless! Having the video of this film as well I noticed several scenes on the DVD edition that were missing from the VHS edition.
The DVD edition also includes a wonderfully funny piece of Will Rogers' ""Blood And Sand"" spoof.",1004400000,,635,4.578947368421052
3497934,3,B001BS2M0G,"Rudolph Valentino blazed on the silent screen with a weird, smoldering sensuality that seems kind of laughable when seen in stills or clips.
Not so in ""BLOOD AND SAND,"" his most celebrated role. Rarely seen today, this classic silent in a new digital transfer from a 35mm archive negative does justice to the enigmatic Valentino's portrayal of Juan Gallardo, a young Spaniard who achieves his boyhood dream of becoming a famous matador only to fall under the malefic charms of mysterious Dona Sol (Nita Naldi).
The compilation, exotic stereo music score is performed by the acclaimed Mont Alto Motion Picture orchestra. The disc comes with a wealth of supplemental features including a filmed introduction by Orson Welles, a great parody starring Will Rogers, footage from Valentino's funeral and more. Brooding and hypnotic and funky. No one smolders like Valentino. Was he gay or just pleasant?",999820800,,896,5.186206896551724
3497935,4,B001BS2M0G,"Whoa. I have got to say. ""Blood and Sand"" was the very first slient flim I didn't have to sing the ""boring"" song for. I mean, the acting was great, the screeplay was awesome (considering it was based on my favorite book.). The directing was good, too. In fact, there was nothing wrong with it-only the slience! It's true. Even the young people, I think, would like it.",981158400,,368,4.426470588235294
3497936,5,B001BS2M0G,"Made in 1922, this is the first film that had his name on the marquee as a star, having captivated the hearts of millions of women a year earlier as ""The Sheik"".
The previous reviewer is lacking knowledge in two areas: The art of silent films, and what makes a lot of us women tick...he asks, ""What's the big deal ?"". Rudolph Valentino on screen was a man with a passionate heart, and a gentle soul, a combination that drives women wild. He was also a superb actor. Watch his hands throughout the film...like when he leads his bride to the bedroom, or the swift wipe before he takes Doa Sol's hand. There are many little subtleties that are wonderful...and silent films aren't ""old"". They are a  special art form unto themselves, and can't be compared to the films of today.
This is a truly magnificent film. I find the the way it's photographed (by Alvin Wyckoff) enthralling, the sets terrific, the bullfighting scenes compelling, and of course, there's Valentino...still captivating after all these years.
This tape also includes an 11 minute piece of memorabilia from 1923. A film of Valentino judging a beauty contest. It's amusing, and interesting to see footage of him off-screen.",978134400,,1187,4.790243902439024
3497937,3,B001BS2M0G,"I watched this video for the sole purpose of seeing the legendary Rudolph Valentino for the first time.  I was curious to see if he lived up to the legend.  Sorry to say, I don't get it.  Maybe it's because I'm a guy, or  maybe it's because the film itself isn't that great.  It's basically the  story of a young bullfighter (Rudy) who is torn between the good woman he  married and the vamping (and overacting) bad woman whom he lusts after.  The scenes with the bulls are pretty good, but the rest of it doesn't come  of as well eighty years later as it may have when this film first came out.  Valentino is competent enough, but I have to ask, ""What's the big  deal?""",962496000,,670,4.238095238095238
