171266,5,0842526919,"This is Part II of the Journey of Faith series. This video depicts where scholars think Lehi's family landed in Central America. It also explains that Lehi's family wasn't necessarily the first family to land there, and that they encountered other people as they migrated. The quality of this video is excellent and the cinematography is incredible. The interviews with leading LDS scholars and non-LDS scholars also helps the viewer appreciate the challenges that Lehi's family faced and how blessed they were. This video should be required viewing for all Latter-Day Saints!",1231027200,5,576,5.271739130434782
171267,5,0842526919,"the production quality is off the hook! its perfect. the video takes you through the Book of Mormon and shares amazing truths that verify the books cultural proofs and other points that debunk lots of the junk contenders of the book of mormon hold.  i love how much more real and persuasive the words of the prophets are now that i've dipped into their time period and gotten a feel of their landscape, customs, language, history.

i HIGHLY recommend the first video  they made as well, called journey of faith. (minus ""the new world in the title"") .  it shows unarguable physical proof of the book of mormon and is based on the lehi and nephi's journey till they arrive in the new world. thats where this movie picks up... both are a must have for anyone",1219795200,3,755,4.489051094890511

7793102,1,0842526919,"While it claims to be the product of years of ""extensive scholarly research"" it is hardly scholarly.  Seriously NOT.  While the Book of Mormon is in fact a true history of an ancient civilization, the location was NOT where this pile of speculation suggests.  And beyond speculation there is no scholarly evidence that it was.  Lot's of double talk and nonsense.  These ""scholars"" are trying to put a round peg in a square hole.  If they would look in the right location, the evidences are vast, true and abundant.  I suggest you look at the Heartland of America where Joseph Smith said this civilization was and you will rejoice in the scientific proof of the claims in the Book of Mormon.  Visit <...> and enjoy the journey.",1341619200,,726,4.661417322834645
7793103,5,0842526919,"This is an excellent exploration to the cultural and archeological aspects of The Book of Mormon. Contrary to what Harrison Salisbury and others may say, it is NOT incontrovertible proof of The Book of Mormon. LDS representatives even state that in the end of the documentary. I found they're statements very enlightening, I would pay close attention to what they say and not what others (including myself) say about The Book of Mormon in these reviews.

This DVD simply explores the places and people that could be the locations and groups mentioned in The Book of Mormon through objective research. I'm an Anthropology major and found the methods used in this exploration very dependable, citing both member and non-member professionals and representatives alike.

If you are just curious about The Book of Mormon and the arguments for and against it, this is a good watch to give you the ""for"" side but don't mistake this as proof of The Book of Mormon, rather an exploration of the cultural and archeological findings that may support its historical validity.

All in all, great documentary and enlightening learning experience. You're bound to get something out of it one way or another. :)",1302739200,3,1195,4.994974874371859
