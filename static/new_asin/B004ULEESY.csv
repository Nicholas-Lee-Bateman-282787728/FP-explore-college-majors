8441690,4,B004ULEESY,"For a low budget movie I found this one to be surprisingly very good. An interesting plot told in a series of individual flashbacks which all come together at the conclusion. Normally I don't moves with flashbacks but this one is easy to follow and gives you a better idea of just how these four young men came to get themselves in so much trouble. A young Frank Sutton of ""Gomer Pyle"" fame does a nice jot of acting as do the other three actors. Once again it may be low budget but it's worth watching and very enjoyable as well.",1427673600,4,530,4.257425742574258
8441691,2,B004ULEESY,"Of interest only as the film debut of the lovely and talented James Franciscus.
A typical Fifties B-Movie about a quartet of juvenile delinquents who kill a cop
in a stupid, botched robbery. You'll be yawning and thinking about a snack long
before this short piece has meandered along to its inconclusive conclusion.",1427328000,,316,4.981132075471698

8441693,5,B004ULEESY,"When I first saw this film. Circa 1958 in a Cardiff flepitt cinema. It blew me away. Now some 50 years later it still has impact. Stressing the economic and social  causes of juvenile crime. The end of the film still gives one pause to consider it's implications. Sadly like so many fifties films the music does not seem right. At the time I recall for us teens it was rock,rock,rock and rock'n'roll. While for too many period films it's big bands and jazz. Perhaps more to the producers tastes than a true reflection of the times.",1339718400,4,531,4.474226804123711
8441694,4,B004ULEESY,"Someone will have to explain this movie to me. With the exception of James Franciscus's character, the lead ""Boys"" are all stupid, unappealing, and/or whiny, self-absorbed losers.

Frank Sutton (Sgt. Carter on Gomer Pyle) plays a numbers runner, with lousy taste in women, who's been skimming his gangster boss (always a good idea) so he can impress his girlfriend by throwing cash around; Larry Green is a self-pitying schmuck, tired of being broke all the time (but apparently unwilling to really do anything about it) who whines to his mother about having to eat pancakes all the time instead of eggs, then punches his boss (another great career move) and gets fired because his coworker girlfriend has been stepping out with him; and William Hinnant is a vertically challenged dweeb who decides to join the others in their robbery scheme basically because he's got nothing better to do. Idiot Sutton even spends $50 on a new dress for his girl just after the mobster gives him one week to come up with his $300 ""or else.""

They've all been freeloading off of landlord Ned Glass, and get all bent and start a fistfight when he decides to rent their ""clubhouse"" to another gang who actually have some money. They set up a dance/raffle to scrape up some cash (an idea stolen from the rival gang) by scamming both the attendees and a TV shop owner simultaneously, then are pissed when the gangster has his henchmen rob them of the proceeds to pay off Sutton's debt. So what do they do then? They take a cab ride, stiff the innocent cabbie, then punch him out to boot to prove what ""big men"" they are.

Then they get the brilliant idea to steal the boxoffice receipts from a boxing match, which of course goes horribly wrong, with Franciscus getting shot in the process. (He's the only one with a remotely justifiable need for the money: his wife needs an expensive Caesarian section.)

By the end of the movie, I was pretty much hoping that all but Franciscus would indeed get ""the chair."" What was the point of all this? It's never a good sign when you're rooting for the cops to take down the protagonists of the movie. Sheesh!

The MOD DVD from MGM presents the film in full frame 1.37:1, open matte so you can enlarge it on a 16x9 TV and watch it in its proper widescreen aspect ratio. The source print is in great shape, sharp and detailed, with excellent contrast and grayscale, which really shows off the crisp B&W, noirish cinematography. There is virtually no damage and mostly tight, unobtrusive grain structure (other than in a handful of shots here and there where the grain is somewhat conspicuous for some reason). There are no extras whatsoever, not even a trailer, although there is at least a menu screen. (I really dislike some of Sony's MOD DVDs where there isn't even a menu, and the movie just starts playing when you pop the disc into the player.)

The movie isn't much to rave about, although I did have some fun making derisive comments about the stupidity of the characters and story, so my overall grade is 4 stars.",1333756800,3,3041,4.63265306122449
