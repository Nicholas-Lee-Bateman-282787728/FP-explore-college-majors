8289680,5,B001CUBB3M,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949

8289683,5,B001CUBB3M,"When one thinks of ""The Rockies"" you would be thinking of Colorado for a fact. Most of these stories I found to be very interesting and informative to say the least. The segments mentioned are ~
~ Buckskin Joe, Co. Named after said person and the Mines that helped develop the town
~ The Hanging Barn
~ Manitou Springs
 ** Emma Crawford, A Pianist/Spiritualist and well respected woman of the town. When she died, her wish was to be buried on top of ""Red Mtn."".
Later years had her resting place disturbed by developers and her remains were found and later reburied in the town cemetery. She haunts it and perhaps the very place on the Mtn. where her grave was disturbed. The town holds local parades and charity races in her honor.
** The Crawford House is discussed
~ 1890 Pikes Peak, ""Womack"" struck Gold.
~ ""Cripple Creek"" Gold Mines
~ Palace Hotel
~ 1886 Molly Tobin, Leadville, Colorado
