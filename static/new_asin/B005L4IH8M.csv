8477360,5,B005L4IH8M,"Welser-Most has been supported by a major Upper Austrian bank for over 25 years now as a cultural envoy. This level of support suggests that Welser-Most has something special to offer in terms of Austrian music especially. The sleeve note describes Welser-Most's trademarks as 'Calm and composure' and this is certainly true of his podium manner but not all is so calm beneath the exterior. Those who know his recent Summer Night's Gala or the 2011 New Year's Day concert with the VPO will also be aware that he can produce very lively responses from his orchestra too. So how is his Bruckner?

In his bonus interview, Welser-Most makes a case for linking this particular symphony to the music of Wagner, and particular Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. The link is through the tonality of E major, the themes associated with German Romanticism, the mutual admiration the two composers had for each other, the prominant use of Wagner tubas in this work and Wagner's death during the composition of this symphony. Welser-Most sees the Adagio and its climatic conclusion as the key moment when all of these influences come together.

I have grown to like this interpretation very much indeed over several viewings and in the context of knowing both the Abbado and Wand performances. Inevitably, given Welser-Most's views about the work as summarised above, a key moment in evaluating the emotional intensity of this issue comes at the climax of the very long slow movement which builds to an enormous peak. The effect on the conductor at this point is clear as he is clearly deeply moved. It is certainly very effective for the viewer too.

I would view Welser-Most's performance as typically having a very clear long-term view of structure held under tight control but driven by a deeply held conviction. The climaxes are massive but this is balanced by considerable moments of delicacy. The Cleveland orchestra is well able to deliver at this level and the concert is well recorded as sound with sympathetic camera work which is detailed without being invasive. Much the same comments can be made of Welser-Most's interpretations of Bruckner's 5th and 8th symphonies in the same series.

This is not the only way to play Bruckner. A more overtly emotional way can be experienced with Abbado at Lucerne, who also includes a fine performance of Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto with Brendel. That is well recorded too. A further alternative is the Gunther Wand performance but, for me, his recording is now too compromised to fully realise Bruckner's sound world which I find is better served by both Abbado and Welser-Most.

The imaging on this disc is crisp and clear as expected from an HD source with sympathetic camera work. The excellent sound is wide ranging and presented in DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo. There is a short bonus interview as mentioned previously.

This is a very fine disc and should win over many new listeners to Bruckner as well as being satisfying to current enthusiasts. It seems to me to therefore fully justify a 5 star rating.",1343520000,,3042,4.920077972709552
8477361,5,B005L4IH8M,"Elsewhere, in my review of the Abbado Bruckner 5, I commented on the Bruckner ""sound"" being more realistic on this disc of the #7 with Welser-Most and the Clevelanders, my theory being the acoustic quality of Severance Hall is more suited to the mighty Bruckner brass chorales than the Lucerne Hall.

The other thing I like about this disc is the momentum that Welser-Most brings to this piece. It never feels hurried, but you feel like you're headed somewhere - not just being subjected to a series of melody vignettes. The conductor, in his accompanying monologue, posits that Bruckner was the precursor to modern composers like Adams. I actually see some connection with Phillip Glass. A lot of Bruckner's technique is to use string arpeggios running through the chord progressions as an underpinning for either the woodwinds or brass main melodies. If you take these arpeggios by themselves, they do sound like Glass utilized this same M.O. for a lot of his almost hypnotic music.

The Cleveland Orchestra plays wonderfully, and the many beautiful melodies are given their full weight. As to the recording, there is a very burnished sound here, with lots of warm bass component. As I've said before, the brass takes full advantage of the hall acoustic. The video quality is likewise impeccable, so this disc is a definite winner. It is a very approachable symphony, and because it comes in at just over an hour, it will not tax your patience if you haven't heard it before. This disc is a tutorial on how, if a conductor understands the piece and the acoustics of the hall in which it is played, he can extract the perfect marriage of performance and sound.

Much nonsense has been written about Welser-Most being cool and distant, not sufficiently involved in the music he conducts. This disc would appear to refute that silly claim. Just because he doesn't linger on every little phrase,and drag it all out, it doesn't mean he can't ""feel"" the music.

His version of the Bruckner 8 on bluray is due out at the end of July, in the ""complete"" version. I can't wait - in fact, I have it on order!

The other versions of the #7 I have heard are by Thielemann (very good, but slower at 72"") and Wand (good but a little long in the tooth now). Neither are on bluray.

Don't hesitate on this one.",1342656000,,2295,4.682382133995037
8477362,1,B005L4IH8M,"I already have 30 ARTHAUS Blu-ray disc, and I've never had any problem with any of them.
However all the sudden Bruckner 7th of Cleveland's picture quality is horrible.
The lines are jagged everywhere, during the whole 66 minutes.
The whole disc is like an upconverted SD.
Although in the bonus part the quality of the picture of the inserted short concert's excerpts are good, so there was nothing wrong with the recording, but possible with the manufactoring.
I hope that they are gonna withdraw this shoddy goods, and revise it.",1321660800,,531,4.846153846153846
8477363,5,B005L4IH8M,"Any recording of Bruckner has the ghost of Celibidache to contend with and the Rumanian Maestro made several outstanding recordings on LD and DVD that still look and sound very impressive. I compared this new release very carefully with the Sony LD recorded on tour in Tokyo. As one would expect it is a very different beast! Celibidache's 7th runs for some 83 minutes, measured but beautifully controlled and majesterial. This is much faster at only 65 minutes but does not seem to be too fast in performance. I enjoyed it very much. The picture and camera work are excellent and the sound wonderfully rounded and satisfying. Comparisons are not appropriate as the two performances are just too different. I love both and wish EuroArts, who have the Celibidache recordings in their vaults, would bring them out in a Blu-ray set. Equally I hope Welser-Mst records the other major symphonies as he seems well suited to his compatriot's music. If you like or want to learn about Bruckner get this disc. The booklet and a 12 minute talk by Mst is very interesting. In either German or very good English but without any subtitles",1318636800,5,1125,4.804123711340206
