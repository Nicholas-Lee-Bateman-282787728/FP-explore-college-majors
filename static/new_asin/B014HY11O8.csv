8730807,5,B014HY11O8,"Excellent for beginners, intermediate and advance dancers! It's simply folkloric workout that full of spice and cute steps! Here is the DVD menu:

Welcome
Spice workout
Tutorial
Dance performance

The spice workout sections are:
Drum solo 1
Saidi
Drum solo 2
Debke
Drum solo 3
Fellahin
Drum solo 4
Karsilama
Drum solo 5!
Chiftetelli
Those are the non stop 30 min workouts

The drum solo workouts are almost the same every time, it is just to get ur hips going, the other two girls don't really follow the exact moves Tanna does and this is a plus! Tanna mentioned that bellydance is improvisation art so u should add your touch/spice to it! It's not ""I do, you copy"" since that builds up tension in the body that you may not be able to get rid of later so get your hips going with the drum solo and make your own fun
I liked Fellahin, debke and saidi they are simply fun workouts

In The tutorial section, she talks little about the culture behind each folklore dance then break down the basic moves of each workout ( debke, saidi, fellahi, karsilama) i like some of the things she said about each dance, for instance: debke steps are unisex lebanese/syrian line dance! Karsilama is turkish dance, fellahin workout is very sassy, it means farmers or pretty much the country dance of Egypt!

The performance: each of the 3 dancers is performing, they use most of the moves used in the workout

Overall, it's a nice workout, hope u enjoy it as much as I did",1444348800,5,1455,4.513307984790875
