1784935,4,B00006LPB1,"What can one say about the Inspector Morse series?  Breathtaking settings, finely crafted story lines, engaging characters - one can go on and on.

These are pricey sets, notwithstanding that each one has 5 or 6 episodes, and considering somewhat marginal quality and the fact that they are not (and should be!) captioned.  Nevertheless I'm hooked; I must have them all.

5-stars for content; 1 for presentation.",1159056000,10,412,5.104477611940299
1784936,4,B00006LPB1,"I love the Inspector Morse shows and these are absolutely awesome but I was disappointed in the quality.  I'm not a technical expert with dvds and remastering but I immediately noticed that the shows looked like a homemade vcr tape edition.  Wasn't the end of the world but a bit disappointing.  I bought two different sets and found both the same so I'm guessing the small Canadian company didn't have the same standards as I have come to expect with dvds.  Overall, great shows.",1149811200,18,480,4.678571428571429
1784937,5,B00006LPB1,"This mystery opens with the discovery of a body in the river, a body which is difficult to identify given the fact that the corpse is decapitated.  Shortly after the body is found, Morse is contacted by an old acquaintance from his university days.  Alex Reese, a not so friendly rival from Morse's past, now serves as a college master and has achieved a certain prominence by methods both fair and foul.  Reese informs Morse that his college deputy (David Carridge) is four days overdue from London and asks Morse to make some discreet inquiries regarding the fate of his missing colleague.  Carridge is apparently a homosexual; therefore, Reese is concerned that his associate might have mingled with some unsavory characters.  Is the corpse from the river the missing deputy?  This question becomes especially pertinent when it is determined that the corpse was clothed in a suit belonging to Carridge.  By the conclusion of this mystery, two other homicides have occurred.  This episode is characterized by a blend of non-edifying behaviors: revenge, adultery, alleged plagiarism, character assassination, unbridled ambition, and general malevolence.  We are exposed to a recurring theme in the Morse mysteries--- the unscrupulousness of university elites who compete for recognition and reward.  Several suspects have possible motives for having committed one or more of the homicides; but the possibility also exists that all the victims were murdered by the same perpetrator.  Interesting clues (an apparent bit of flesh on a chopping block, an earing left at a murder scene, and vintage bullets retrieved from bodies) all help to add spice to this mystery.  This entry in the series is another excellent portrait of human vices and the negative consequences experienced by those who create numerous enemies in their quest for success and gratification at any cost.  Despite the serious themes, there are elements of humor in this episode.  Morse is burdened with a toothache at the beginning of the mystery, a problem which causes him to display a certain helpless frustration and impatience when confronted with the demands of these challenging cases.  In any event, this episode represents yet another excellent entry in the series of Morse mysteries.",1101168000,13,2261,5.241666666666666
1784938,5,B00006LPB1,"This is Set Two out of six total Collection Sets. Set Two has six episodes of ""Inspector Morse"". The first two episodes originally aired as the final two episodes, in the same order, of ITV Series 2 (the BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons""). The last four episodes were the British Series 3 in its entirety.

[Note: You don't want to confuse the six ""Collection Sets"" with a newer run of ""Inspector Morse"" DVD's, called simply ""Sets"". There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. Each ""Set"" has only three episodes on three discs.]

Episodes:
The Settling of the Sun - first aired March 1988
Last Bus to Woodstock - aired March 1988
Ghost in the Machine - aired January 1989
The Last Enemy - aired January 1989
Deceived by Flight - aired January 1989
The Secret of Bay 5B - aired January 1989

THE SETTLING OF THE SUN:
An Oxford school has a welcoming dinner for its summer international students. Morse is at the head table, next to his friend, Dr. Jane Robson. At her request, he created a crossword puzzle for the summer attendees. He's there to give a prize to the student who does the best on the crossword. Morse gives a little speech before awarding the prize: ""On the whole, crosswords are far more exotic and exciting than police work. Most murders, for example, don't require solving because they haven't been planned. Thought a lot about, perhaps, over the years. Not as murders, but as silence. The silence of a wife, a husband, a son or a daughter, even. No more words, talk, screams, arguments, insults. Insults more often lead to murder than anything else in my experience.""

During the dinner, a student from Japan suddenly takes ill, and leaves the hall for his room. He shortly turns up murdered, his body laid out as if a crucifix. Is this hatred left over from WWII? Another doomed love for Morse. And his speech is prophetic - in the breach.

Trivia: This episode, written by Charles Wood, is based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.

LAST BUS TO WOODSTOCK:
It's raining cats and dogs, late at night and dark. Sylvie Kane and a friend approach a bus stop. Sylvie asks an old woman, Mrs. Jarmon (played with zest by Fabia Drake), also waiting, ""Excuse me, when's the next bus to Woodstock?"" Sylvie decides to hitch, and gets into a red car. Her friend gets on the bus with Mrs. Jarmon.

When Morse meets Sylvie, later that night, she's dead in a pub parking lot. According to Max de Bryn, the pathologist, she has a broken neck and was run over. Not only that, she has a very odd letter in her purse. The next morning, a cheerful Morse brings Lewis up to speed: ""Coded messages. Murder. Right up my street. It's not a bad way to start the day!""

Trivia: This episode is written by Michael Wilcox, based on Colin Dexter's very first Inspector Morse novel, of the same name, published in 1975.

Morse's car in the original books was a classic Lancia. In the TV show, it's a 1960 Burgundy Jaguar MK III 2.4. The Jaguar proved so popular, that Dexter went back and revised new editions of his books to change the car to the Jaguar. In 2001, after the last Morse episode, the car was given away in a competition. In April, 2002, it sold at auction for 53,000 British pounds sterling, much more than similar cars had gone for. In November, 2005, it sold again for more than 100,000 pounds sterling.

GHOST IN THE MACHINE:
Sir Julius Hanbury goes missing, and his library was burgled. Lady Hanbury isn't worried about the burglary. All that was taken were some paintings she considers low-brow soft porn. Morse and Lewis are called in, however, because, as Morse grumbles to Lewis, ""The Chief Constable dines here once a month, which is why you and I are wasting a fine summer morning on a footling art theft. ... People like them, they think people like us are only here to keep the servants in order.""

Throw in a French au pair and her boyfriend up-to-no-good, and the missing Lord turning up dead and battered in the family mausoleum, and Morse has plenty to sink his teeth into. Morse is, however, put off his stride when the pathologist who arrives for the body is a young lovely woman. It's Dr. Grayling Russell, and she doesn't appreciate condescension due to her sex.

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell based on an idea by Colin Dexter.

THE LAST ENEMY:
Morse and Lewis are called out to a canal, where a young couple found a body. Dr. Russell, the pathologist, tells Morse she can't tell him much about the victim, which disgusts him until he realizes it's because the body is missing its head, arms below the elbows, and legs below the knees.

On a supposedly totally different tack, Morse visits Sir Alex Reece, headmaster at Beaumont College, Oxford. Sir Alex, sinister and smarmy, presumes on an old acquaintance with Morse. He wants to go on vacation, and no one can find Dr. David Kerridge, Vice-Headmaster, who was supposed to fill in for him. Morse isn't fond of the arrogant Sir Alex, and neither are we. Is Kerridge laying headless in Dr. Russell's morgue? Could a Morse episode be that simple? And speaking of Dr. Russell, in this episode, Morse starts to warm up to her, even asking her out for a pint.

1 Corinthians 15: 20-28. Death is the last enemy.

Trivia: This episode was written by Peter Buckman, loosely based on Colin Dexter's 6th Morse novel, titled ""The Riddle of the Third Mile"". Published in 1984, significant changes were made in the book's plot for the TV episode.

DECEIVED BY FLIGHT:
Anthony Donn checks into his old rooms at college. He's there for a cricket match with his old coach's current amateur team, The Clarets. Morse knew the two of them, too, but that was 20 years ago, and he can't figure out why Donn is getting in touch with him now. Donn tells Morse a Zen Buddhist story, that seems apropos of nothing. And though he seems to have something on his mind, Morse can't convince him to speak it. The next afternoon Donn turns up dead, an apparent suicide.

Morse and Lewis talk to Roland Marshall, the coach, confined to a wheelchair but feisty as ever. In what I think is an un-Morse-like plan, and with the coach's connivance, Lewis takes Donn's place on the cricket team for the match. It turns out there was a reason behind the Buddhist story, wouldn't you know it.

Trivia: This episode was written by Anthony Minghella based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.

THE SECRET OF BAY 5B:
Morse is all dressed up, attending a Policeman's Ball. The dance is Ladies' Choice, and the lovely Dr. Russell, looking very unpathologist-y in her pink and black ballgown, asks Morse for the dance. He complies, but in spite of her prompting, even flirting, he can't bring himself to compliment her. Then Lewis arrives with news of a body; Morse is saved by the bell.

The body is in a carpark, the dead man sitting in the driver's seat, shot through the closed window. Morse is puzzled by a minor point, ""Why would the killer take the keys, and leave the car?""  That's not the only puzzling thing in this convoluted story. And it's not the only body to turn up, either.

Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. I find Morse's reluctance with Russell touching. Here's a man who keeps falling in like with women who don't want him, and he is simply uncomfortable with the overtures of his lovely colleague. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary, John Thaw says, ""You know, he's just a loser all around in the love stakes. I think women [viewers] have a soft spot for somebody who messes up time after time!""

Happy Reader",1337472000,4,7605,4.587324981577008
1784939,4,B00006LPB1,"In Last Enemy, Insp. Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the identity of a decapitated body found in a canal. Meanwhile, Morse gets called on to investigate the apparent disappearance of an Oxford don. The man who calls him in is an old college rival of Morse's who is now a Master at Oxford, and it becomes very apparent that Morse can barely stomach the man who is full of airs and graces and extremely arrogant.

As the story progresses, Morse and Lewis unravel a web of intrigue involving an attractive young graduate student; rivalry amongst the Oxford dons (a recurring theme in many Morse episodes); and even body parts on a kitchen chopping block! As customary in the Morse episodes, viewers get treated to a story centering on human compulsions, notably greed and ambition that lead to homicide. Highly recommended for fans of superior British crime procedurals.",1322352000,,894,4.920529801324503
1784940,5,B00006LPB1,...but not for video quality. The video (as other have noted) is rather poor quality. Still a pleasure to watch. I advise that if you are interested in Morse that you buy this - I suspect that these will disappear from the US market before too many years. Another piece of advice - brush your teeth twice a day.,1306540800,,311,4.288135593220339
1784941,4,B00006LPB1,"This is another in the boxed sets of Inspector Morse, one of the finest detective series ever produced.  Yes, the picture isn't up to the standard we all now expect, and the writing can be extremely complex.  But the intelligence level is always high, and John Thaw and his fellow British actors are uniformly first rate.  It's a distinctive series in many ways, appealing to the mind far more than the groin and the incessant adolescent clamor for explosions, violence, and bad music.  It takes a while, for example, to get used to the main character, a complex man of many sorrows and culture joys who never quite gets his way.

There is one selection in this set, however, that is a dud: ""Deceived By Flight.""  It is a mess, and the responsibility is the writer's.  But don't let that discourage you from enjoying many hours of superb adult entertainment.",1272672000,,858,4.68
1784942,5,B00006LPB1,"Like all of the Inspector Morse mysteries, this set of six shows, made in the late 1980s, is superb in every respect.  The late John Thaw still sets the gold standard for acting in a ""police drama""--a term which inadequately sums up the complexity of both the character he portrays and the TV series from which the shows in this boxed set are drawn.  These BBC productions are also a rare example of a TV seires that is better than the writings (novels by Colin Dexter) upon which they are based.  Dexter is, at best, a mediocre writer.  Not to be missed in this set of stories, incidentally, are some terrific British actresses, including Patricia Hodge, the alluring Sharon Maughan, and the lovely Mel Martin.",1243209600,2,711,4.664
1784943,5,B00006LPB1,"This is an excellent, entertaining series.  It is well acted and sticks fairly closely to the books.  The main character is a well educated, very intelligent man with an appreciation of fine music and cross-word puzzles.  He is a closet romantic with a crusty exterior who drinks too much beer which he finds necessary in thinking through the solutions to crimes.  I now have all the series and find I go back to see the episodes again and again, especially when introducing Morse to new fans.",1231632000,,493,4.6976744186046515
1784944,5,B00006LPB1,"This is a wonderful addition to our collection..Thank you for having it.

1784945,4,B00006LPB1,"In this ""Who Done It?"" the last enemy is last; a little riddle to which the video will reveal the solution.  The episode is somewhat convoluted; multiple murders with many suspects - many characters with various relationships - including one between Morse and the master's female administrative assistant.  Much takes place within the academia of Oxford and concerns the aspirations of educators attempting to further their careers. The diversions in this entry are not what we have come to expect from Morse.  His rather bothersome tooth burdens him through the first half, and his social time finds him in a caf with loud contemporary music, although we do visit an outdoor pub more than once.  One wonders where this story is going until things begin to fall into place with very little running time remaining.  This is a good addition to the series with a different spin relative to its approach and solution.",1177977600,2,913,4.9411764705882355
1784946,4,B00006LPB1,"When Morse investigates the death of a headless, armless, legless body found in the Thames, he soon finds himself dealing with several more deaths, along with mistaken identities, missing persons, the vicious infighting among Oxford scholars for prestigious positions, the sabotaging of each other's careers, infidelity, and a helpful ""scout,"" a custodian who has spent his life at Oxford and knows everything about everyone.  As always, the mystery is fun to follow, but the center of attention is firmly fixed on Inspector Morse, whose mood is colored by his problems with an infected tooth, which he has been reluctant to address.

In this 1989 addition to the third Morse series, Morse reacquaints himself with Alex Reece, one of his contemporaries during his Oxford years--a vain, arrogant man who is head of Beaumont College.  Reece wants him to investigate the disappearance of David Kerridge, the Vice-Master of Beaumont, who has been missing for four days.  He is concerned, not because Kerridge is missing, but because he fears that any scandal regarding the disappearance will reflect badly upon himself.  Reece is scheduled to give one of the Sheldon Lectures, an honor guaranteed to lead to future academic promotion.

As the atmosphere at Oxford is revealed, along with the professional hostility toward female academics who might threaten someone's position, the episode highlights the class differences, traditional biases, and intellectual snobbery which color the behavior of those whose lives in academia have insulated them from the give-and-take (and the basic human feelings) of the real world.

As always, John Thaw as Inspector Morse and Kevin Whatley as Detective Lewis are on top of their game.  Amanda Hillwood as Dr. Grayling Russell, the attractive pathologist who interests Morse, is superb, though her casual attitude toward the bloodiest and most gruesome murders contrasts with Morse's--his queasy stomach is a constant problem.  Character actors, such as Lana Morris as Miss Tree (who comments on the plays on her name) add immensely to the drama, though the musical focus, which is one of the highlights of this series is absent here.  The photography, as always, is outstanding, though many viewers might have preferred being spared the closeup of Morse's mouth as he's being treated for his infection.  A good mystery and fine addition to the Morse series.  n Mary Whipple",1172102400,6,2409,5.277486910994765
