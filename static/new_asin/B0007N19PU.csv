2220242,1,B0007N19PU,"This program was BORING! As much as Billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated, about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were, and of course my kids at home, and I'm sure any other kid picked up on this, and soon lost interest.

Several things made this program boring:

One, you can't understand a thing Billy is saying, he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program, and his demeanor was very un-natural, to the point of being fake. He just looked & sounded very out of place working with kids. It came across like he & his crew weren't really sure how to interact with the kids, making them appear to be very fake. Another boring point was the movements, there was absolutely NO creativity here, these were some of the EXACT same movements from the adult Tae-Bo videos. Now, I do applaud Billy for slowing the movements down (unlike the adult Tae-Bo which goes at a break neck pace), these movements are performed in a controlled manner. But, they are still adult type movements, and extremely boring for kids. I would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly, and more EXCITING!

To be honest my kids were turned off & bored with this program after the first 10 minutes. Something Billy needs to realize is, kids are smarter than people give them credit for being. - They can tell when someone is being fake & not truly having fun, and they also realize that when kids on T.V. are bored & not having fun, then this isn't something they want to do. Kids want to have fun, and want to watch the instructor & other kids having fun. That is how you motivate children!",1119657600,29,1669,4.5016501650165015
2220243,4,B0007N19PU,"I thought this was a wonderful DVD because of the following factors:

*The goal of this Billy Blank's DVD is to get kids off their feet and exercising.  In this day and age of television, video games, and a joke of physical education in schools, it's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity.

*The diversity is great.  The children on this DVD consist of both boys and girls, ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old, all sizes from thin to slightly chubby, and different nationalities.

*Billy Blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he's loved by young and old.  He motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them, even throwing in a couple of old dance moves. :-)  Billy Blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit.

As far as the fitness level, I could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you haven't exercised in a while.  The good thing about this particular DVD is since it's geared towards kids, Billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect, his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun.

Overall, I think this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together.",1119484800,80,1306,4.377593360995851

2220256,5,B0007N19PU,"""this is a fun and exciting video""(my 8yo daughter). This is a fun video-the excitement and energy of an aerobics video with martial arts moves. I disagree with critics concerning the idea that martial arts moves are violent or inappropriate for kids with regards to this video.  As far as I remember(I've done this with my kids 2-3 times), Blanks makes no reference to self defense or the significance of doing the moves(other than improving self esteem or fitness). The background music is ""nice"" and motivating. We've seen other videos and appreciated how Blanks leaves a majority of the talking to the beginning and end of the work-out(other instructors(Rich Grogan) seemed to try to make small talk during the work-out(unrelated to the moves-if you like that's great-we just want to hear how to do the moves and a few inspirational words of wisdom)",1424995200,4,853,4.965034965034965

My daughter always tries to do them with me (but being only 4 yrs old) it's hard for her to keep up with the more advanced work out videos. So I got this one for her and she was excited to see that other kids are doing it too. It keeps her workin out for a good 20 mins. Eventually she'll be able to do the full 40mins. Not pressure though, it's all in good fun, and trying to teach her the importance of exercise and healthy eating at a young age. I recommend this tape to any mom or dad trying to do that for their children as well. :)",1392076800,,639,3.885496183206107

He loves to bike ride, swim etc, but is not a fan of running sports (soccer, basketball...) so I thought this might be a good fit. It totally was. Don't get me wrong, this workout is tough and long. My 7 year old got through about 25 minutes of it before he pooped out, and his 4 year old brother held on for about 15 minutes. It is the cutest thing to watch them trying to keep up with the moves, but the important thing was that they were moving and having fun. Pretty sure you can't beat that!

It's a pretty serious workout for me with goofy fun intervals for dancing around with my son.  It's my go to activity on a day when the weather isn't right for outside time. Billy Blanks has kind words for the kids and is encouraging. The pace of this is good. When it's over I am always shocked we're done already.

The next thing I knew, they were all up dancing and performing the work out! I was amazed! The kids were ages 7-10 and having a blast! That was about 2-3 yrs ago and I have purchased the dvd since then for my 3 yr. old and 1 1/2 yr. old and the 3 yr old does extremely well. The 1 1/2 yr old jumps around and at least attempts most of the movements.

It was the first which I was able to stand from the beginning to the end without getting bored or getting the impression that the instructor believes that kids are mentally retarded.
Most of the workout was done with an intensity and with the right amount of repetitions relevant for healthy non-athletic kids.
Personally, I would expect more kick-boxing exercises for workout with such a name, but I'm not sure that kids really need more.
I would recommend this workout for parents who want to start exercising together with their kids, but it would not be a workout which they will do for years.",1303948800,3,700,4.608

2220300,5,B0007N19PU,"As a Recess Monitor at a Elementary school, we were looking for an alternative to board games and coloring during our occasional bad weather indoor recess days. We also felt exercise is good for you and should be fun. So on the times the gym is not available, we wanted something that could be used in 30 min. and didn't require a huge space. So today I got to test this out on two classrooms of Kindergarteners...THEY LOVED IT!!  We moved some tables and chairs back and set it up.  The students followed along, laughing and counting along. The best part is, it's done in place. There is not a lot of moving across the room, etc... So you are not moving side to side or front to back like some exercise routines. The moves are done in one spot.  Billy Banks has the ""cool guy"" factor working for him too. There is another instructer to help him and girls and boys of different ages to follow along with. So I think it could be used with K through 5th graders.(I have 2nd and 5th grade boys) He keeps their interest up and it's fun! I was worried it would get chaotic, and some of the roudy kids would start crashing into others, but they didn't and followed along beautifully. And let me tell ya, it's was a great workout! I did have a few toward the end that got tired, so I told them they could stand in place, rest and watch, which they did.  Even some of the Resource teachers joined in and did it with us.  Everyone was laughing and smiling:) I'm going to buy one to keep in my home too!  WE LOVE IT!!",1285286400,4,1507,4.215277777777778

2220314,3,B0007N19PU,I bought this so I could exercise with my 7 year old daughter.  We like it but I find that it's pretty intense for someone who's not in shape.  The workout is about 40 minutes long and I can only get through about 20 minutes before I'm exhausted.  I also wish they would have an introduction that shows the kids how to do the moves instead of just throwing them right in.

What I loved was that they had lots of different kids.  Boys, girls, younger, older, and some that had a little more chunk to them.  It showed that any one can do it!

2220363,5,B0007N19PU,"This tape is even better than Billy's original Kid's Tae Bo.

As a Physical Education teacher, I'm often displaced from my gym and in inclement weather I have to conduct my classes in the classroom. Billy's workout for kids is a great alternative to my

regular curriculum activities and the kids love it. In fact,I love it so much I do it myself!

Thanks also for the fast and efficient delivery service!",1124668800,2,405,4.597222222222222

8049050,5,B0007N19PU,"Okay, I'm not a kid.  I first started using this just before I turned 60. when I wanted to lose weight.  It's great for kids of all ages!  If you're out of shape, it's a good beginning workout.  I had reached a point where getting off the floor was a chore.  Within a couple of weeks, that problem was resolved.  I just started the workout again, and it will take me a couple of weeks to get up to speed.  Once I'm comfortable with this workout, I'll again advance to the more strenuous Tae Bo workouts.  I had lost my copy and had to order a new one.  It's worthwhile!",1481155200,4,569,4.1

Billy Blanks is so energetic and really gets the kids moving through this hour of exercise. From stretches or kicks and punches, he keeps them entertained from start to finish.

My daughter loved that he was ""talking to her"" and she kept talking to him. It is hilarious. Smaller children would love this fitness video, but may not make it through the entire thing, especially when he moves into the recovery stretches...but hey, at least they are moving.

We use this DVD two or three times per week. I would even recommend it to parents who want to make a great example for their kids. Doing exercise as a family is a great way to bond and to stay in shape.",1441497600,5,761,4.352112676056338
