8156452,5,B000KGGNCS,"My son found this for me, so I could have it for keeps.. He is the sgt in charge of the striker that saw the Kiowa hit and the one who picked up the pilots, and unknown to me at the time was the squad going door to door. Very proud of him and his men.",1442361600,,251,3.5
8156453,5,B000KGGNCS,"I was one of the Shadow 200 TUAV operators (96U in army lingo) who was actually controlling the UAV camera for footage in this video. It was 2nd Infantry Division 3rd Brigade 1st of the 14th Cavalry Squadron Delta Troop (the dragoons!) in Iraq between 2003 and 2004.

This was one of the more gripping encounters from my year overseas and I am super lucky to be able to have an edited unclassified version of the video to save.",1401494400,,427,4.405063291139241
8156454,4,B000KGGNCS,I was in Bco 3rd platoon and we were the first people to respond to help the scouts and they didn't even get that right. I am sorry you guys were not given credit. I remember Charlie Co being there brother you guys are not forgotten. To be honest all they interviewed was people from 3rd platoon mortars and scouts so that is why they are the heroes of the day.,1302739200,2,361,4.098591549295775
8156455,3,B000KGGNCS,"They forgot to mention the Iraq Soldiers and the Soldiers from C 5-20 INF. If I recall, I was in the middle of the firefight and I was not in Scouts or Bravo Company. I feel that they could have done more research or maybe some people do not want to give credit where credit is due.
