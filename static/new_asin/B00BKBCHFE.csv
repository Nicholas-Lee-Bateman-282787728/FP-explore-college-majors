5636040,4,B00BKBCHFE,"This review is based on seeing the first two episodes.

I am reminded of an interview of Eric Idle of Monty Python I heard once, wherein he describes a script he wrote.  It basically had two guys saying the same word back and forth to each other over and over and over again (I think it was ""Right"" or ""Yeah"").  The producer looked at it and said, ""I don't get it...why is this funny?""  Then they performed it, and because of the way it was performed, it was in fact very funny.  The same applies to Mysterious Girlfriend X.

To describe it is to describe something that doesn't sound all that remarkable or interesting.  To see it, is otherwise.",1370390400,3,646,4.378151260504202
5636041,4,B00BKBCHFE,"I guess that to say Mysterious Girlfriend X is different would actually be an extreme understatement. To say that it's a love it or hate it anime, that's probably more accurate. The plot follows the romance between Mikoto Urabe, an unusual girl who within one episode bursts into a fit of maniacal laughter seemingly for no reason (she also she wields scissors as a weapon with some skill) and Akira Tsubaki, the guy who's addicted to her drool. Yes, you read that last part right. Some will immediately be turned off by the fact that this series is about a guy whose connection to his girlfriend is through her drool. The drool is very much a part of this series and yes, for many people this will be too much.

For those okay with this though, you're in for a treat. The animation on this series is STUNNING. Beautiful, gorgeous, a thesaurus will run out of words and not heap enough praise on the artistic merits of this series. In the opening episode there is a dream sequence involving a dance, and I knew from that moment I would have to watch the series to the end simply because of the visuals. The blu only makes it better. There are seriously some scenes that it feels like you could pause at any moment and hang the image on a wall.

Now that I've talked about the artistic merits, let me say, the story is amusing. There are several laugh out loud moments. The plot has some interesting turns and the series has better than average voice acting. Part of the fun of this series is listening to Urabe, who does not even sound like your usual anime character... she sounds like a real person in terms of her voice, which only adds to the strangeness of her character. For those who care there is an English dub included, which is surprising given Sentai's usual releases (I cannot judge the dub though as I'm a subtitle only person).

Some will probably complain that there is a lot in this series that goes unexplained. Some of the explanations for the weirder aspects seem illogical, and keep the viewer expecting for a different answer that will never arrive. While this may be annoying, I must point out that the title is ""Mysterious"" Girlfriend X. The title lets you in a little on this before you even watch the show, so you can't say they didn't warn you.

I'm honestly a little surprised this series got a release in the US let alone a blu-ray release. The plot is a little out there and no doubt a little gross to some. Yet, the novelty of this one is part of the charm. Hopefully Sentai will give more unique anime a chance here in the US. I highly suggest that if you're an anime fan you give it a shot. This one's worth it.",1370304000,4,2644,4.40081799591002
5636042,5,B00BKBCHFE,"First I don't want to talk too much about the story because there are other reviews about it in this section. However I just got back from ACEN( Chicago Anime Convention ) who were selling it early. To make a quick conclusion its a great adaptation of it. The dub voices are a lot better then I was expecting and work well with each character, the Blu-ray version comes with Japanese audio and English, 1080i 16x9, and English subtitles. It also comes with Japanese promos, previews, and sentai trailers. Also including clean opening Animation and  closing animation.

This is subject to change if I find anything else I'll make sure to add it to this review or if you have any questions about the Blu-ray edition please PM me or comment and I'll do my best to get back to you, overall I find it to be a great version of the series and worth anyone's time, in sub or dub.",1368921600,4,871,4.403726708074534
5636043,5,B00BKBCHFE,"I have watched this a number of times on Crunchyroll, I have it stored permanently in my queue there, and was really happy to see it coming out on BluRay.

And honestly, I cannot give you any direct answer as to why I like this anime. I just do. I have seen any number of negative comments on this anime, but before you decide it is not for you, and have not seen it, go watch it first on Crunchyroll, for free. Then if you like it enough to buy it, like I did, do it!",1368057600,4,468,3.875
5636044,5,B00BKBCHFE,"The initial impression I had from this anime is that this would be a really queer series to watch. I decided to give it a try since crunchyroll had it available for subscription and I actually enjoyed watching the story and seeing the characters progress through their problems.

Story:

The premise is that a new transfer student names Urabe comes into the class of the main character Akira and she ends up creeping everyone out by out bursting into laughter. One day Akria comes back into the class late and wakes up Urabe and tells her to go home and she ends up leaving a drool puddle on her desk. For some unknown reason Akira decides to lick that drool.

Throughout the series Urabe's drool has some mysterious effect on Akira. This is really out there with the drool thing, but the story does suck you in and makes you want to know what events take place each episode. I never found it to be predictable at all with a really unique character like Urabe. The series definitely has more a mature theme, but I never found it to be creepy, it's just how the characters are.

Animation:

The animation is pretty cool in this series. It has the high-definition quality of 1080p, but the character design have that classic 1990/2000's look to them a bit and it ends up blending together wonderfully. The locations they visit and the school setting all look amazing in HD and you never get bored watching the events taking place. The main characters themselves have their own unique look to them and you can tell who's who even if they are in the school outfits, or city clothes.

Soundtrack:

Some of the themes are really, really cool. The main one I love is the dream theme; which is the song that plays when Akira has a dream, or any dream like sequence that plays out during the anime. It was really nothing I have heard before and was stuck in my head for a while. The other themes are mainly a mix of the opening and ending themes.

Speaking of the opening and ending songs, the voice actress for Urabe actually sings both of them. I only found this out by looking at IMDB and I thought this was pretty cool that she can both act and sing really well. The opening theme reminds me a bit of Chobits though, since you can hear a bit of theme at the start of it. The closing theme is interesting to listen to as well.

Verdict:

I really enjoyed watching this anime and it's nothing like I have seen before. The memorable soundtrack, characters and story make this a series I really recommend to anyone who enjoys anime; especially those who like stories about relationships. Granted I know the droll thing can make some people not want to watch this anime at all, but is it really that odd compared to series that have aliens with superpowers that shoot beams, or giant robots fighting intergalactic wars? If you can get past the droll theme, you're in for one of the most unusual and great series out there.

Positive:
* Really cool story that sucks you in
* Never found it to be predictable
* Great mix of classic character design with High Definition Resolution
* Characters are identifiable with unique design
* Dream theme is amazing and extremely memorable

Negative:
* Drool thing might turn away some people
* Also has some mature themes in the episodes",1366502400,24,3265,4.505922165820643
5636045,5,B00BKBCHFE,"There are techniques used by storytellers and others to grab the audience and to hold their attention;this crazy series grabs a ""handful"" and doesn't let go,even when it becomes clear the two are heading down the path to probable romance. The initial tasting of her drool may feel like a slap across the eyes to even the most hardy of otako's and cause the weak to run screaming from the room but if you take it as a French kiss... without the tongue...and the kiss...,well,it still is a bit off the wall. The tasting of drool,so goes the storyline,tells the taster the true feelings of the the drool doner that they are unable to express in words,but only if there is a ""connection"" to the other person.
What you will get is a great,well-drawn,dare I say,intelligent series about a male teenager that falls for a very strange teen-aged girl that,among other weirdness,carries a pair of scissors in her panties, even in her bikini while she sunbathes at the beach. For whatever reason,she pulls the scissors out and uses them to astonishing effect on whatever object that she targets.
 Probably one of the best offerings from the anime ""gods"" this season and is on my ""must buy"" list. Easily PG-13 but probably aimed for the 16-17 age group. I got my copy quickly and it is a first-rate product. The ""fan-serv"" in this edition remains the same few times she pulls her scissors out and the ""nudity"" is,even without details,(ie,no nipples)the nude bodies are further shaded or blurred. As the story is the purpose of this series and not fan-service,it is most highly recommended.",1362614400,22,1577,4.7765567765567765
5636046,5,B00BKBCHFE,"Unfortunately, as too often happens, the people who write the product summary have either never watched the show in question, or are misguided enough to believe that sensationalism is the path to sales success. What I mean to say is the ""Editorial Review"" (which is rather a ""official"" product summary) is almost entirely misleading as to what this show is about.

Here's what Mysterious Girlfriend X is really about:

This is a low-key romantic comedy about a couple of high schoolers discovering love for the first time with each other. Although there are some unique circumstances as to how this comes about, the core of the story is not really about those oddities, but rather about how this couple grows together emotionally over time.

Mikoto Urabe is the titular ""Mysterious Girlfriend"" -- and an intriguing mystery she definitely is. In the strictest sense she represents what is sometimes referred to as the ""Magical Girlfriend"" type of character... however this is played very low-key for most of the series, with the emphasis instead placed on how she handles developing her love interest (given her unusual attributes), rather than any stories focused on her ""powers"" per se.

Akira Tsubaki is the often bewildered protagonist -- equally accepting and intrigued by Urabe. Probably the most important thing I can say about him is: he is normal, in the sense that he is neither an over-the-top pervert, nor does he recoil in fear whenever a female pays attention to him (unlike alot of anime male leads). His reactions are pretty understandable, and generally he is a pretty mellow guy.

There is drool exchanged, and alot of it -- but this is reasonable when you consider how much drool is exchanged in your average french kiss (not to mention other bodily fluids in intercourse). Some people seem to haven a strong aversion to this, but that really comes down to some unrealistic ideas as to what is ""hygienic"" in human sexuality (which is not a terribly hygienic act). Mysterious Girlfriend X handles these realities with a very matter-of-fact honesty that is quite refreshing.

Overall, the series is heartwarming and humorous, and I think by the end of the series you will find yourself rooting for the couple to continue growing together long into their mysterious future.

Addendum: After I purchased the Blu-ray I was able to watch the entire series dubbed as well. I think it was a pretty good dub overall, and it could absolutely be enjoyable for someone who hates subtitles -- but I still prefer the original Japanese cast, and would recommend watching the subtitled version.",1362441600,106,2596,4.967741935483871
5636067,5,B00BKBCHFE,This is a very interesting video and worth watching  in my opinion.,1440720000,,67,4.583333333333333
5636068,5,B00BKBCHFE,"Wonderful anime certainly one of the best ones I have seen in a while.  I will grant the whole drool premise symbolism is a bit weird but, even with that it is absolutely great.  I first watched it through youtube twice and I am still buying the collection.  The only bad thing I can say about it is that there simply isn't more of it nor is it known whether or not more of it will be made.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this anime.  I would certainly not pass up the opportunity to watch this.",1440633600,,507,4.13265306122449
5636069,4,B00BKBCHFE,"I recently saw this entire anime on YouTube, I'm still planning on buying the DVD because I couldn't find the ova online, and i would watch it again.

5636070,5,B00BKBCHFE,"So, yes, this is a very strange anime, but you probably already guessed that, if you know anything about the premise... The big question is if the anime is any good, despite it being strange.  I can honestly say that this anime is simply fantastic.  It is in my personal anime top ten, and my favorite romance anime of all time.  This anime is about relationships, and the struggles and joys that come from them, instead of the ""will they, won't they"" garbage that a lot of romance anime suffer from.  The strange premise is a little gross, but beyond it, there is a really sweet and enjoyable anime.  My only complaint about the collection is that it did not come with the OVA episode, other than that, I have no complaints about the Blu-ray collection.",1431216000,2,754,4.514705882352941

5636072,5,B00BKBCHFE,"If you have gotten overly comfortable staying in the tried and tired formula of other rom-com anime this is a chance to really step out into a story thats unexpected and awkward. But I mean that in a good way, its a refreshing and new experience.
The artstyle is also really nice, not overly glitzy and moe'd up.

As far as the physical product is concerned, its a standard barebones blu rei slimpack. No interior art, inserts, or any special features that go beyond the usual affair. Which is fine, the show is there with a pretty good dub and original voice acting and thats all I would ask for.
The case also has the plastic saving recycle symbol cutouts, which I really wish never became a standard as it makes the case feel very flimsy and the artwork has a tendancy to get sunken into it. What I do to remedy this and as a pretty easy fix is I cut out a couple panels the right size from a comic book board and slide them in behind the artwork. Taping to the case through the case cutout holes. It pushes the artwork out to be nice and flat and gives the case a much more sturdy and straight feel to it.

Anyway, great show and an original premise. Hoping for a season 2 someday.",1425945600,,1185,4.238938053097345
5636073,4,B00BKBCHFE,this anime was pretty good though it left a few things out as well a few strange moments but this is part of anime it is a fairley solid story if  just a bit silly here and there not sure what to compare it too if anything a bit of grossness if you do not like this it may turn you off but overall i liked all right,1422576000,,315,3.6323529411764706
5636074,5,B00BKBCHFE,"This is only the second time I have watched an anime and then decided to read the manga.  MGX is one of those shows you can watch over and over.  I knew by the second episode that I watched for free on Hulu that I was going to buy this one.  I don't know why, but I really like this show.  Its original and yes a little out there, but it grabs you and makes you want to know whats going to happen next.

Animation:  One Star -- Very well drawn and a little different style than most anime.
Story:  One Star -- One of the most original and mysterious.  Its not fast paced or hurried.
Voice Acting:  One Star -- Japanese voice acting is excellent.  (I will catch the Dub after I buy it)
Music:  One Star --  The opening theme is really good and the music through out is very interesting.
Overall:  One Star --  This is now one of my all time favorites.

SPOILER:

I watched the entire show in less than 24 hour and then read the manga in the next 24 hours.  By now you know its about swapping drool, but its so much more than that.  Think of it as sharing awkward teenage feelings and emotions without talking.  Urabe shares her emotions with her boyfriend, but on occasion he shares his with her.  They do this by swapping drool.  Its through this that they build their relationship.  A normal couple might lie or feel awkward about their feelings, but these two can't because of the bond they share.  If your like me you will keep hoping that these two kiss, but at the end you realize that by kissing each of them would share their emotions involuntarily and there would be no secrets.  So for the most part Urabe is bravely sharing her emotions with her boyfriend and expecting nothing in return.  He gets to know her on a deep emotional level without any real physical contact or explanation.  You will notice that Urabe doesnt like being touched or hugged without permission.  For her its uncomfortable and unnecessary to be touched.  The drool does all that for her.  I am sad to say, but after reading the manga there isn't much they could do to make a second season.  The manga develops the relationships a little further and Urabe eventually befriends his sister.  A few other friends are met, but in the end they never reach a level in their relationship where they feel comfortable kissing.  Its really bittersweet.  Urabe continues to share everything with him and he only occasionally shares with her.  She goes out of her way and against her feelings to try and become a permanent part of his life.  By sharing drool they share every experience a normal couple does, but in their own way.",1422144000,,2601,4.404210526315789

Urabe is the newest transfer student, and she is not exactly fitting into Tsubake's class.  her hair covers her eyes, she laughs for no reason in class, and she falls asleep on a dime.  But it is when she is sleeping that the magic begins.  When she is awoken, she leaves behind a small pool of drool - which our hero samples.  But when he becomes sick - Urabe realizes that he is the one for her as they have a connection with the drool and they can sense how the other is feeling.  Add to the fact that she carries a pair of scissors in her panties, which she uses with devistating effect.  But when another girl in the class also has a connection with Urabe, she begins to realize that having someone to connect with is not so bad.  Now can this unusual couple bring about the happy ending, even when trying to keep it a secret from everyone else.

I enjoyed this, a more realistic romance humor story than most anime this day.  You really feel for the characters and enjoy the development and relationships that they have.  The soundtrack and scenes are well done and I really wish they would do a second season, but they really did not leave that type of opening.

5636102,5,B00BKBCHFE,"I won't give a description of this, already available. The studio description doesn't do it justice and sells it short.
I finally got my copy of the DVD and have been watching the series over again. I have been enjoying the small, subtle hints and background character development. The story is actually rather sweet and the more I watch it, the better I like it. The drool doesn't bother me, or get in the way. There is no way that words could express the feelings that Tsubaki and Urabe have for each other. One realizes how intense (dare I say mind shattering) a real kiss might be!
 Tsubakis frustrations at the pace of the relationships development is understandable. But I think he realizes what the true depth of Urabes affection for him is.
 I still think that there are a whole lot of questions regarding Urabes background that would prove quite interesting. (The manga doesn't touch on that aspect either. I have enjoyed the manga, but after 77 chapters, I'm left asking for more background. I don't see a lot of development as a couple).

 The only real disappointment I have with the DVD is the english dub. First, I didn't expect one. Nothing I read in the reviews or DVD decriptions led me to believe there would be one. That being said, the dub is poorly done.
 Although it follows the sub titles pretty closely, the VA's chosen are hard to appreciate.
 The VA's just don't give me the same feel as the subbed version does.

 Tsubaki= Josh Grelle
 Urabe= Genevieve Simmons
 Ueno= Greg Ayers
Christofer Ayers is the ADR manager.
 Oka= Brittny Karbowski

This is truly an amazing work of art",1373500800,2,725,3.9726027397260273

5636105,5,B00BKBCHFE,...for a love focused anime. This a is definitely on my top five anime of all time not just on the romance genre (it's right next to Nausica of the Valley of the Wind),1370908800,,167,3.9411764705882355
5636106,5,B00BKBCHFE,"First, listen to the other reviewers and NOT the blurb on the back of the package. Though I like spit puns as much as the next person, that is a very inaccurate description of the tone of this show. It's actually a pretty serious - and often sweet - show, not just a gross-out comedy. Nothing really gets explained about Urabe's ""powers"" (no answers in the manga yet either) but it preserves her mystery. Anyway, when I first watched the show, I might has well have had some of Urabe's addicting drool: I marathoned all thirteen episodes in one day!

It is rated M, and rightly so, but it's pretty tame compared to most M-rated things I've seen. There is no sex, no violence to speak of, some nudity shielded by strategically placed shadows (edit: a bit more than I remembered, you can actually see some... topmost female body parts in the second episode, though they are shown in the shadowed side of a sunset), a few suggestive surreal dream sequences, and no bad language that I recall (at least in the subtitled version). The topics of sex and arousal are touched on, mainly to illustrate some of the embarrassing/confusing feelings, and honest wonderings about sex that most teenagers have. But one thing I really love about the show is that the main couple is taking their relationship very slow. I read an essay online calling it ""the first pro-abstinence anime"", and that sounds about right to me. Or it's at least pro-waiting. I would say this show is appropriate for more conservative teens ages 16 and up.

Finally unless you really like the manga, I would not recommend buying this show without watching at least several episodes first. (At the present time, it's streaming legally for free on Crunchyroll.) I absolutely love it, but I realize that there are a lot of people who won't. There's a slowly building romance with no ""payoff"" in the traditional sense, so that may disappoint some viewers. And then there's the drool. And a lot of it. That kind of stuff doesn't bother me, but I have always kind of been labeled the weird one in my family... and at my school... and at my church... and, well... Try the show: you just might like it.

Update: Got the blu-rays, and just wanted to say that the picture and sound quality is fantastic. Had to watch the dub for comparison reasons and I LOVED it. Since I don't speak Japanese, I missed a lot of the nuances in the tones of voice the characters were (probably) using. I can actually discern them in the English dub, so I enjoy the show even more now than I did before. I thought the VA they picked for Urabe was perfect. Tsubaki's voice sounds a significantly different from his Japanese one, but his VA's earnest performance won me over. Only complaint: Urabe's classmates who have about 3 lines apiece can't seem to agree on how to pronounce her name. (Lack of communication in the dubbing booth?) It didn't affect the story, but I found it a little annoying. Almost no special features, if you care about that. I found this to be a good release, and I'm sure going to get my money's worth out of it.",1370822400,9,3068,4.56442831215971

8569922,5,B00BKBCHFE,"This story will fool you.  It is not a horror story, unless you consider a story of young love that horrible, and if you do, you haven't seen this story. At its core is a quaint, old-fashioned story of first love in high school,... but nothing is quaint or old-fashioned involving Mikoto Urabe, the antisocial, high-speed scissors wielding enchantress that has won the affections of disturbingly average Akira Tsubaki.  Their relationship evolves at an astonishingly slow speed (i.e. normal speed) with the previously noted odd emphasis on drool, scissors, and other weird antics, but at its core is something most high schoolers (or former high schoolers) can recognize, though told from an odd, humorous POV.

8569924,4,B00BKBCHFE,"Not even close. To say this right up front: I am a grown up male without any feminist tendencies. I also speak Japanese rather fluently so I was able to compare the subtitles with what the characters actually said, unfortunately, the subtitles are almost as bad as the editorial review. The series was painful to watch, mostly because Akira, the male protagonist, reminded me of my own stupidity at that age.

The story is simple - girl meets boy, they fall in love, but the stupid boy is too embarrassed to admit it publicly because Urabe (the female protagonist) is somewhat 'unusual.' Supposed to say, she sets the pace at which the relationship develops. She knows what she wants, she is committed, mature, intelligent and creative. While her female classmates mostly speak with squealing Minnie-Mouse-voices, her voice is that of a grown-up woman. She tells Akira pretty much right away that she is still a virgin and he is the boy she is going to have sex with for the first time, when SHE is ready. When Akira complains about her not being interested in things like holding hands and kissing, she shows him what she finds exciting. She makes him close his eyes and the undresses in front of him. Her excitement comes from not knowing whether he will keep his eyes shut or not, and she lets him know. She can communicate her feelings to Akira directly by sharing her yodare (=saliva, not 'drool'), making him feel what she feels, and she can experience his feelings the same way. In the context of the series, this is not unusual at all, as other classmates can do that too.

The lousy interpretation of the Japanese original goes on and on, that's why I took one star off. Does she 'break out into sudden fits of insane laughter,' as the editorial review suggests? No. She cannot help laughing when a funny thought comes into her mind. (Happens to me, too.) That happens just once in the entire series, so there are no multiple 'fits.' Whoever wrote the editorial review should do his or her homework on the terms they are using. The word 'expectoration,' a play on words on 'expectation,' does not at all refer to saliva. Saliva is the physiological product of the salivary glands, whereas an expectoration is a pathologial fluid, mostly infected mucus from the throat or lungs produced by coughing. (Yes, I am a physician.)  The subtitles use the word 'boobs' where the Japanese uses the neutral term 'mune' which can also refer to the chest of a male person, and so on.

Apparently the producers were not entirely comfortable with the idea of a girl in command of her own sexuality either, so they had to invent some weird attributes, such as Urabe apparently being able to move with superhuman speed in some situations, but the way the story is presented to the Western audience is just lurid.  In this day and age, a girl who is in command of her own sexuality must still be decried as odd, peculiar, weird, anti-social, insane, bizarre and dysfunctional?
