2710191,5,B000LKAROS,"I really like this DVD, it is very relaxing, I did the pilates part, and I liked it very much. The yoga part is very nice to watch, so I really think that I going to like also. Very nice job.!!!",1177891200,2,194,3.7560975609756095
8162017,5,B000LKAROS,I wish Kerry Bestwick would do more videos.  This is one of my favorites.,1453075200,,73,4.214285714285714
8162018,5,B000LKAROS,"This is one of my better yoga DVDs.  The instruction is very good, and the instructor's British accent is pleasing without being distracting.  It is shorter - at 40 minutes, it is a little easier to squeeze in in the morning.  I tried the pilates routine (also 40 minutes) once, but I prefer yoga, and my abs hurt the day after the pilates routine.  I'm sure it is good but I prefer yoga.  The yoga segment is very good and has a nice amount of time for warmup and savasana at the end, with good guidance for savasana.",1314230400,,518,4.244897959183674
8162019,4,B000LKAROS,"I really enjoyed the yoga part of this DVD (didn't try the Pilate's). My only complaint was that it didn't last long enough.

The workout was very thorough and (even though it was only 40 min long) I worked up a pretty decent sweat. I enjoyed Kerry's voice and the picturesque scenery. I thought her instruction for getting into the poses was great and they were held for an advanced amount of time. Overall, I really enjoyed it and the time flew by. I also really like the opening meditation and love the shavasana at the end. I just wish she had made the yoga workout a little longer.",1303257600,,586,4.376146788990826
8162020,3,B000LKAROS,"This lady talks non-stop during the exercises! It's over the top and very annoying, especially during yoga.",1287964800,2,107,5.352941176470588
8162021,5,B000LKAROS,"I am overweight and rather a beginner when it comes to pilates and yoga, but I love working with this dvd and will continue to do so.  Somehow Kerry is able to motivate me even when I do not want to be motivated.  Her British accent is very soothing and relaxing allowing me to focus on the moves and my core.  Well done Kerry.  Thank you.",1245715200,,339,4.090909090909091
8162022,5,B000LKAROS,"I really enjoy doing yoga outdoors, so when I saw a video that was filmed outdoors, I was really excited.  And to my relief, the workouts were as nice as the scenery.  I use this video to supplement marathon training and skiing in the winter.  I have found that if I have a great video and can do it in my home I can afford to do yoga.  Hopefully Kerry will make another video soon.  My highest recommendation for those with some beginning yoga and pilates experience.",1225843200,2,468,4.333333333333333
8162023,4,B000LKAROS,"I have been doing yoga/pilates dvd's for a few years now and so I have a basic understanding of certain poses, which I recommend for those who are interested in this DVD.  While she does explain the poses, it is brief and expected for you to follow her voice as she flows through (rather than glancing up at the tv screen for guidance).  Her voice is extremely soothing and her english accent is comforting.  My favorite part is the end where she describes the relaxation process.  This video also includes a few balancing poses that I could not master, but with a few tries I'm sure I'll get there.  I recommend this video for those with a basic understanding of Yoga/Pilates and those that are slightly flexible.",1209081600,3,714,4.590551181102362
8162024,4,B000LKAROS,"This is a pretty good paced DVD.  It's not necessarily for brand new beginners.  It's better if you know some of the poses already.  The pacing wasn't too slow or too fast, but some of the poses are more difficult, especially for someone like me who's new-ish to yoga (I knew most of the poses already).  I would think for more advanced practitioners, this would not be enough for them.  She also doesn't explain or offer modifications to some of the more difficult poses.

I also did the Pilates part.  I'm new to Pilates and it was rather challenging for my core muscles.  I'm hoping it will get easier with practice.

Overall a good DVD that I like, that I will cycle through.",1205798400,5,679,4.455284552845528
8162025,5,B000LKAROS,I don't like yoga.  But I'm into it now thanks to Kerry Bestwick.  This is a great DVD where you can alternate between Pilates and Yoga.  Both workouts are challenging and make my body feel great.  Not too slow and not too fast... this DVD stikes the perfect balance.,1195689600,6,267,4.387755102040816
8162026,5,B000LKAROS,"I studied with Kerry while a graduate student at PSU and I was amazed at how well I was able to tone my body supplementing my cardio workouts with her core classes.  I took her Pilates, Yogilates and Body Bar classes.  I can honestly say that it was because of Kerry that I took the time to become a certified Pilates mat instructor.

This DVD provides an excellent combination of Pilates and Power Yoga!  I have been alternating the 40 minute sessions each evening, five days per week and I can already see and feel a difference in my body.  It is the closest I can get to being back in her studio.

I would highly recommend this DVD.  And if you would like more information on the instructor, her website is here: [...]",1181001600,8,721,4.335820895522388
