8307164,4,B001GU3D48,"Films about Israel tend to be admired in the USA insofar as they portray Israel as a nice place, or at least as a place that's striving to be nice. I'm not all that surprised that Oded Davidoff's 'Mishehu Larutz Ito' hasn't even been reviewed yet, since it depicts Israel as a place with a pretty healthy and not very glamorous network of organised crime, which preys on the vulnerable and the young and exploits them. The film is an adaptation of David Grossman's novel, probably the most accessible novel that this particular author has written (and he turns up in a brief cameo as a puzzled onlooker). Bar Belfer and Yonatan Bar-Or share the acting honours as two young people who are roped together by circumstances as well as their own decisions. Belfer is Tamar, a late teenager/young woman whose brother has vanished into the underclass; she goes in search of him by means of a complex plan which commences with her shaving off her lustrous black hair and then busking on the streets so as to attract the attention of the crime gang that gives buskers a place to stay in return for creaming off most of their earnings. Bar-Or is Asaf, a young guy working for the dog pound, who has been given the job of reuniting a stray dog with its owner. It turns out that the dog's original owner is Tamar, but that the job of bringing the dog back to Tamar (who has specifically abandoned the dog as part of her plan to rescue her brother) will involve Asaf in a whole world of pain.

So it's a kind of very, very dark teen adventure tale, with a fair amount of death and drug use and corruption, and it's not exactly wonderfully uplifting; it also features one of the most drop-dead ironic versions of the Israeli national anthem ever committed to magnetic tape, as performed by Belfer and Yuval Mendelson as her smack-addicted brother. Belfer is enchantingly cute as Tamar, and Bar-Or is what the website tvtropes.org would describe as 'adorkable' as Asaf. The fact that it incidentally exposes how Israel is betraying its young people should be for everyone watching it a bonus item.

Trivia fact: Belfer went on to serve in the Israeli Defence Forces in the Army Radio division, but in 2010 she was seriously hurt in a car accident. She made a very good recovery except that, the last I heard, she can no longer remember more than a sketchy outline of her life before the accident, and although she's fully capable of leading her life, she's somewhat bemused that she's an award-winning actress. A bittersweet follow-up to such an impressive debut.",1346025600,2,2548,4.634955752212389
