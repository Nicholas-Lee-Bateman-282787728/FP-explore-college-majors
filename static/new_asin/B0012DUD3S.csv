8601936,4,B0012DUD3S,"""The Dragon - The Great Wall"" starts out on a large road in Beijing with glitzy high-rise buildings and western shops - Pizza Hut, McDonalds, etc., and then moves to Tiananmen Square, and the gate to the Forbidden City.  Behind Tiananmen Square is an old part of the city containing a maze of tea shops, herbal medicine shops and silk merchants.  Shots taken from the back of a pedal rickshaw depict the criss-crossing hutong - narrow lanes accessible only on bicycles or motorbikes, many built as far back as the Yuan Dynasty, lined with residences.  A single residence consists of a wall abutting directly on the street, and a central courtyard with rooms built around the courtyard, usually occupied by a single family.

The White Dagoba Temple in Beijing, was built during the Yuan Dynasty in Nepalese style, destroyed by lightening in 1368, and reconstructed during the Ming Dynasty.  The temple's original name means ""Temple of Great Holy Longevity and Eternal Peace.""  The temple has several halls and yards, and a large chalky-white Dagoba with 36 copper bells hanging from its roof.  A good part of this film is taken up with aristocratic residences and gardens surrounding the seat of power in Beijing, including private residences for favorite ministers of the emperor, and huge gardens complete with artificial hills and pavilions.

The film's final sequence takes us to the Great Wall, which can be accessed via day-trips from Beijing.  Tourists may hike up the mountain to the Wall or take a cable-car.  There are several Impressive shots of the Great Wall.  The wall is 2500 to 6000 kilometers in length, and is actually not continuous, but consists of a series of separate walls.  Construction of the wall started in the 3rd century B.C. by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang.  It was originally a frontier road network built largely by conscripted laborers.  Peasants used to call the Great Wall the Frontier, but today it is entirely inside China.  Turrets on the wall aided as points of communication via smoke signals.  The film mentions a famous quote from Genghis Khan that ""The Great Wall is as valuable for defense as the courage of the soldiers who defend it.""  During the Ming dynasty, the wall was repaired and consolidated, but after the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall fell into decay.  In recent years, tourists have saved the Wall from destruction and it now makes more money for the Chinese government than at any time in history.

""The Dragon-The Great Wall"" is accompanied by a low key voice-over historical narrative.  There is no gabby tour guide standing at the center of the scene.  This is a low-budget tourist film, and includes shots of local food and local street scenes.  Like the other Flying Monk films, it is a good film for anyone planning a trip to Asia or simply interested in studying Chinese history.",1264118400,,2839,4.870833333333334
