The biographical history of Axel Munthe, the phenomenological exploration of light and architecture, also the omniscient autobiography of the director Pola Rapaport, and the fictional sub-plot of the character played by Edie Falco- all weave together in an amazing way.
I would compare its form to Agnes Varda's The Gleaners and I (also The Beaches of Agnes) and to Gabbeh from Mohsen Makhmalbaf.
I admit that i didn't like it so much the first time i saw it.  The fictional Edie Falco part got on my nerves, but watching the director's commentary and then watching the film again made me appreciate it a thousand times more.  The commentary is great to listen to for hopeful experimental documentary filmmakers.",1254096000,,890,5.034013605442177
7977897,2,B00007L4NU,"after reading the famous book by Axel Munthe , which we loved . i decided to buy this film hoping to learn more about him and his time spent on Capri. This film is more about an American journalist who goes to visit San Michele , little is learned about the doctor . It is short and the woman narrating is meloncholy and almost depressing , the picture in places is grainy and looks like it was copied from a video. Cant understand the other review of 5 stars , the deciding factor for buying. The only good point in this film/documentary is your given a tour of the villa , tho no mention is given to the famous site it was built on.",1200009600,,634,4.120967741935484
7977898,5,B00007L4NU,"This is a fantastic film! The story, cinematography and scenery are mesmerizing and inspiring. Starts out seeming to be a fairly unimpressive story, but then blossoms into a masterpiece. I was so taken with this movie that I went out and bought ""The Story of San Michele,"" the book which is a central part of the film's plot. Loved the book too! This movie may serve as an entry point for younger generations to learn about Axel Munthe and ""The Story of San Michele,"" - which is quite a comeback for a 60 year old book.",1136246400,2,519,4.416666666666667
