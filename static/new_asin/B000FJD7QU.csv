If you like silly humor, and you don't mind a lot of fowl language, then this is your thing.
I love the Trailer Park Boys! Go Bubbles!",1277424000,,189,4.135135135135135
8123536,5,B000FJD7QU,"Have you watched the first four seasons of Trailer Park Boys?

If yes, you'll enjoy season #5. If no, don't start here.

Season #5 Highlights:

The boys build a hash driveway. (What, you were waiting for streets of gold in the trailer park?)

Bubbles buys a rocket set and shares his dream of being a spaceman.

Ray gets lots of screen time in season five. Burned out of his trailer, he moves to the dump and later gets arrested for disability fraud.

Ricky returns to vocational school...as a janitor...and quickly sets up a drug connection for the students.

All in all, Season #5 is a great addition to the Trailer Park Boys collection.

WARNING: The Trailer Park Boys is for adults only. Would you like it? Well, do you own one or more of the following comedies?

8123537,5,B000FJD7QU,"I love TPB! The boys are back up to no good, and unless you're dead you'll find this to be insanely funny! Start with the first season (or the movie) and work your way up. I've seen every episode at least 20 times and I STILL laugh every time! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! And by the way, Randy... If I was looking for advice in eating cheeseburgers, being a male prostitute, and not wearing a shirt I'll come to you. ;)

8123538,5,B000FJD7QU,"OK, we're not your typical TPB fans.  As 35 year-old, mini-van driving parents of 2 and middle managers at work you'd never guess that we'd LOVE this show but its ADDICTIVE and we own every season and the xmas special.  If you're looking for pee-your-pants funny, escapist material this is it!  After a hard day at work just grab a rum & coke and some pepperoni and press play! You can watch this over and over when you need a good laugh and it always does the trick.",1158710400,3,467,4.284090909090909
8123539,4,B000FJD7QU,"The boys are back with the 5th Season.  This season starts kinda slow, but gets better around the 3rd episode.  Lots of laughs and one liners as always.  Not as good as the old ones, but still pretty good.",1154217600,,205,4.205128205128205
