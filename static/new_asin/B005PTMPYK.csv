4857345,3,B005PTMPYK,"The purpose of birth is to die so why bother putting in any effort in life. A young doodling savant adopts this philosophy and decides, in his senior year of high school not to do homework.
Freddy Highmore (George) appeared as a semi-goth loner reading novels at the lunch table. we know he is interested in a popular girl Sally, charmingly played by Emma Roberts. She invites him to her table at lunchtime and asks to be friends. The story develops episodically into a series of events and observations.
  George experiences a series of adventures put upon him which give him a social life and a new reason to avoid his parents (Rita Wilson, Sam Rockwell.) Will friendship turn to love? Will George ever progress from Drawing to painting? Will he graduate high school. Through his adventures answers will come but not always to his satisfaction. Dustin (Michael Angarano) a feckless established artist plays an entirely charming twist is George's artistic and romantic life.",1308182400,,975,4.939024390243903

4857349,1,B005PTMPYK,"the main character is basically the spoiled rich white kid with everything handed to him on a silver platter yet for no reason does he ever try to do anything

the moral of the story is:
if you do nothing
learn nothing
and still be a pathetic piece of garbage
everyone will love you and will keep helping you so you can ""get by""

and don't disagree with me because ""i don't get it""
the thing is that i do get it
and its so pretentious
so annoying
so stupid
so anger inducing

i seriously have never wanted to slap someone in a movie so hard as this character",1461715200,,558,4.10091743119266
4857350,5,B005PTMPYK,"Here is an excellent film about understanding the problems of maturity for a typical High School Youth in the 21st Century.  Freddie Highmore has the talent for bringing into real-life the High School Student who has the talent, but attempts to get by with as little effort as possible, even a fatalistic teenager.  George Zinavoy (Freddie Highmore) has turned his lazy nature into an art with the apparent objective to graduate from High School without completion of any assignment.  Then, George meets Sally (Emma Roberts) who is a kindred spirit.  Sally is beautiful, emotionally complicated and inexplicable.  A Law of Thermodynamics - two negatives become one positive - applied when her kindred spirit upended his lazy nature and world of slackness with end-over-end reaction due to their eccentric and unanticipated romance:  Suddenly, he jumped up and decided to pursue his dreams - and prevails.  As Freddie Highmore the Actor is near the threshold of young adulthood, this film compliments his talent, and more to come is anticipated in his future on the screen.",1461196800,,1072,5.161849710982659

4857380,4,B005PTMPYK,Freddie Highmore is a brilliant actor and the chemistry between him and Emma Roberts is nicely done.

4857382,1,B005PTMPYK,"I really love a good indie romantic drama movie, but I really hate this one. The actors work well enough for their roles, but their roles are just so bland. The characters are just moody teenagers who don't have coherent motives for their actions most of the time, and I failed to connect with any of them. And I am a 17 year old partially moody kid, so that is saying something. By the end of the movie I did not care whether or not the main character got with the girl or whether he failed school or what his future was going to be, I just wanted the movie to end. I buy movies all the time instead of renting them, and this is the only movie I threw away after buying in my entire history of movie collecting.",1409961600,,712,4.0928571428571425

4857389,4,B005PTMPYK,Loved how NYC as the backdrop is really elegantly captured in this movie. The story had its' holes (the parents' storyline could of been more developed but the feature on this disc says the movie was shot in about 21-30 days so scenes had to be dropped from the script) but the characters were likable.,1405641600,,302,4.509090909090909
4857390,1,B005PTMPYK,"This movie was just kind of crap. It's another emo movie that had no real plot, and tried to concentrate on characters and character development, without any real plot. A nightmare. It sort of plodded along with no real meaning and the characters were uninteresting. This is definitely low concept art, and it had an amateur feel to it. The sappy emo music killed me and the whole thing was not quite reality. It was the scenester music that is like a depressed person trying to sing a cheerful tune. It was pure weirdness. If Emma Roberts doesn't change her tune soon and play a different character, I will have to say that I'm done with her. The tone of this movie was the emo thing of really wimpy people trying to smile through the tears. This movie was really bad.",1404345600,,769,4.460992907801418

4857394,4,B005PTMPYK,"Skip to ""Review"" if you don't want a spoiler...

This movie is about depression and an eventual decision. Live or die.
But the title is near perfect.
Forget what the writers and directors and whoever wanted to do with this. If you know depression then you know that the ending is just the start of a new episode for this poor kid in really acknowledging that he's still just getting by.
I say acknowledging and not discovering *my original word of choice* because the I believed that behind each smirk was a sad awareness that made everyday in the life of this character a charade even to himself. That's the true art in getting by. How to deceive yourself. The girl didn't get it. No one did but the sell out artist that he will either become or likely kill himself before becoming.

This was all said very ""definitively"" but that's just how I write sometimes. You could call this more of an emotional analysis. Not a review.

Review: It was alright. It made me smirk and distracted me. I didn't feel like it was a waste of my time. That's a 4 out of 5 for me. only because I never round up unless I have to.",1397433600,2,1109,4.322115384615385
4857395,4,B005PTMPYK,"I enjoyed this.  It was a good movie, but not a GREAT movie.  Both of the lead actors were great.",1397347200,,97,3.8
4857396,5,B005PTMPYK,"This film was a lighter comedy with a big idea behind it. A younger generation struggling with the nature of life and what is expect of you. This film has a similar a similar feel and flow to it like, The Perks of being a Wallflower and It's Kind of a Funny Story"".",1394928000,2,265,4.018867924528302
4857397,4,B005PTMPYK,"Well-filmed and interestingly plotted coming of age story that's very revealing of adolescent ennui and indecision and the reasons behind same. George Zinavoy is a believable character: Smart, talented, and failing to see the point of the apparent rat-race going on around him (I remember that feeling oh-so-well). Sally Howe is similarly convincing and makes an effective counter-character to George.

Definitely worth seeing if you like this sort of thing, but nothing truly special. The story and character development, though not just the same ol', are both a little sketchy and underdeveloped. The script and acting are realistic, but again, nothing spectacular. THE ART of GETTING BY has some real depth to it; nevertheless, it could have gone a little deeper. Only 83 minutes--it might have been better if it had taken more time to tell the story.",1394928000,,854,5.188405797101449
4857398,5,B005PTMPYK,Inspiring movie. I would watch this again. Don't let bad reviews stop you. This movie teaches you a lesson you'll get no where elese in this context.,1394668800,,149,4.555555555555555
4857399,4,B005PTMPYK,"Freddie Highmore has been one of my favorite child actors along with Dakota Fanning and Haley Joel Osment.  Somehow it seems unfair that the years keep going by so fast and our favorite child actors become adults all too soon---for we movie viewers.  Legally speaking,  Freddie may, or may not, still be a child.  I think the actor' age is in the 17 to 20 range so it's borderline.  However he is too old now to play the characters which made him famous.  I was drawn to Art of Getting By to see the actor fully grown and playing a much older character.  I am very happy to report that I found him to be just as charismatic on screen playing a high school senior as he was playing much younger characters.  He still says volumns with his face and using very few words.  He can still create very loveable characters.  Good for us !!!  We are going to be able to continue enjoying the work of Freddie HIghmore.  I purchased the DVD through Amazon and the transaction was excellent as expected.",1393459200,,991,4.384615384615385

4857407,5,B005PTMPYK,"We thought this was a very good movie.  It seems like it was written for our family.  If you are a teacher, this will possibly give you some insight of what these kids and parents go through when their kids go through mental challenges and behaviors.  If you are a parent, you will see that you are not the only ones with these issues and will somewhat comfort you in light of your own situation at home.
I hope you enjoy it and get something good out of it like we did.

I had high expectations because I do think the two lead actors have tremendous talent and potential, and did a great job.  However, the introduction to the characters seemed a bit inconsistently handled.  At times there were efforts to develop the characters and then things seemed to happen with and between the characters that didn't have a solid footing, requiring a bit of a leap of faith in sticking with the story.  There have been other coming-of-age movies that I have enjoyed even though they are all about teens, this one a bit less so.  However, my teenage daughter loved it.",1372118400,,746,4.936

I have been able to be better motivate but this movie truly inspired me to be better not just for anyone or any reason other than for myself. Freedie Highmore is one of my most favored actors and now this film has put him even higher in my opinion. For such a young actor to be able to play this part so well and to a fault is amazing!

Anyway, the chemistry between the two young actors is very good and the oddness patterns of speech and ways of talking of Freddie Highmore is understandable when you watch the sparse five minutes total of the two extras--he's English! Yeah, now that unplaceable American accent now makes some sense.

Yet too much of this was way too odd. Apparently in New York City no one cards high school students in bars or nightclubs. The musical choices on the soundtrack are interesting but, honestly, a bit twee and second division indie. I thought (SPOILER ALERT) Emma Roberts putting the moves on the painter ""friend"" in his 20s was a pretty dumb plot twist. Also, the cramming in of an entire year of homework assignments into three weeks was ridiculously unachievable. Plus the final project painting just did not fit Highmore's art up to that point. He goes from funky out-there fantasy style manga meets graphic novel to a straight very traditional portrait?

The performances worked, New York City as a ""character"" worked, but the plot was too inevitable. Of course, they end up together which is what we all want but the steps to get there at times seemed untrue and at others spot on.",1356739200,,1400,4.753086419753086

4857436,3,B005PTMPYK,"Remember little Freddie Highmore from 2004's ""Finding Neverland""?  Well now he's a tall, lanky 20 year old playing a well-to-do high school senior at a private school in New York City.  He is struggling with his studies and is at risk of not graduating.  Smart enough, but he's lost interest in school and spends most of his time creating interesting sketches.

He meets a cute fellow classmate, Sally Howe (Emma Roberts) who has her own issues.  She's the daughter of Charlotte (Elizabeth Reaser), herself only 36 and still full of vigor when it comes to men and the flash of Manhattan.  Unfortunately there's not much new here.  We have a couple of attractive 18 year olds, struggling with what they will do with their lives.  It's hard to be terribly sympathetic with kids on the ""right side of the track"" not even worried about going to school.

In one scene, George (Highmore) who is still a virgin, is questioned by Sally (who isn't) about it.  He struggles with an honest answer, so she suggests they get it on.  This freaks George out, so for the next 20 minutes we try to figure out what George's real problem is.  I kind of lost interest at that point.  Still first time director and writer, Gavin Wiesen actually does a pretty good job with the direction if not the boring script.  Highmore and Roberts hold their own with the lightweight material.  Michael Angarano is along for the ride as a former student who has made a name for himself as a painter.  He becomes a mentor for George and a lover of the shunned Sally.  I had to look twice but yes that's Alicia Silverstone as one of George's teachers.

The Blu ray transfer is OK but nothing special.  Shot in 35mm film, it has an appropriate soft appearance.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is clear and centered for the most part.  The surrounds don't really come into play until our couple go to a noisy nightclub.

4857437,4,B005PTMPYK,"Saw this film on HBO last night, so this review is of the film itself, not of the DVD.  Considering that I only ran into this movie by switching channels, I was very pleasantly surprised by what I saw.

Major kudos to Mr Highmore ad Mr Angarano for appearing to have survived the kid actor stage and developing into real professionals.  Both put on excellent performances playing roles that require a lot of subtlety, a lot of not looking like you're trying, which is something many much more mature actors are often seen struggling with.  Mr Highmore, specifically, added to his almost trademark subdued style some film noir or even arthouse acting tricks with his body language (his movements are slow, deliberate) and positioning.  Mr Angarano does exactly what an actor in a supporting role is supposed to do, he is there just enough to make what the leads are doing work, but not enough to divert attention from them, which is also a lot harder than it looks.

Where I thought there was room left for improvement was in Ms Roberts' character, and it seems to me her relative ""flatness"" was due to the directing and not her acting performance, as I can't help but think, given her bloodline, she can do better than that.  The reasons for her attraction to Highmore's character are not well-developed, which makes her performance seems somewhat forced, her acting DOES look like she's trying.  Nevertheless, she complements the others well.

Overall, good work by everyone, definitely not run-of-the-mill coming of age drama, well worth seeing.",1346025600,,1547,4.874045801526718
4857438,4,B005PTMPYK,"FREDDIE HIGHMORE: Cute, smiling, innocent, vulnerable, tender, teary.

Right?

Not in this film.

Highmore's performance is low key, temperamental, uncertain, moody, caught between earlier adolescence and later adolescence.

There are no overwhelming tragedies; no heroic moments; no great villains; no gut wrenching catharsis.

In other words the film feels real.
The school is real.
New York is real.
The young people are real.

I taught school for many years and I knew these kids, or ones like them anyway.

The script had the feel of a real New York, featuring a slightly upper crust family with a loner kid who has talent but no motivation to use it or develop it. It is the true love from an unexpected girl, a slightly older fellow artist, his mother, and his teachers that encourages him to make a choice between the road that leads to adulthood or the diversion of unending adolescence.

The film is far too plain to attract much gratuitous excitement, but for those interested in how real people subtly develop the movie is a winner.",1341100800,,1044,4.892045454545454

Gavin Wiesen both wrote and directed this updated existentialist story and cast it with a very solid crew of actors. The result is a movie that is both nostalgic and heartwarming.

George Zinavoy (Freddie Highmore as a very fine developing adult actor) is a lonely and fatalistic high school senior who believes `you are born alone, die alone and everything else is an illusion'. Despite the fact that he is very intelligent and artistic he fails to complete any class work assignments, failing to see the point of doing such mundane tasks if we are all going to simply die anyway. His mother (Rita Wilson) and father (Sam Robards) are at odds: his father's business went bankrupt and he spends his time in the park and in coffee shops to hide the fact that he is unemployed (George sees this unbeknownst to the parents). George finally makes a friend in Sally (Emma Roberts), and develops and attraction for clueless George. The school's principal (Blair Underwood) and art teacher (Jarlath Conroy) introduce him to an alumni, and successful artist, Dustin (Michael Angarano - continuing to be one of the most interesting young actors on the screen today), who can help guide George along life's path, but other distractions start surfacing, and George might not even be able to graduate from high school. How George discovers his feelings and his options is a well played out ending.

There are some fine cameos by Alicia Silverstone, Ann Harada, Marcus Carl Franklin, Ann Dowd, Elizabeth Reaser among others. But the significant satisfaction is the privilege of watching Freddie Highmore graduate into more adult roles: he is becoming a very fine actor.

4857452,2,B005PTMPYK,"George is an intelligent yet intentional underachiever at a New York prep school.  Believing life to be a meaningless charade, he does barely enough school work to pass despite his potential.  When he meets the gorgeous, quick witted Sally, she forces him out of his shell.  He falls hard and learns life lessons along the way.  If this sounds like it comes from the Hipster filmmaking handbook, you're completely right.  As a matter of fact, this film leaves a horrible first impression and never recovers.  For about 20 minutes or so this feels like a cheap cross between Wes Anderson and Diablo Cody, with unrealistically self aware characters and forced dialog.  It doesn't get any better when the character of Dustin is introduced, as his place in the story is immediately obvious as both George's mentor as well as the ""other guy"" for Sally.  It never finds its footing and doesn't feel like its own film.  It's a really derivative movie that was just cute enough to bring to Sundance.

The only aspect of the film that saves it from the cinematic slag heap is the usual top notch performance from Emma Roberts.  As shallow and unlikable as her character is written (and it *is* shallow), Roberts somehow shines through and always commands your attention.  She did the best that was possible with what was given to her, much like her performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Kind-of-a-Funny-Story/dp/B0034G4OZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Kind of a Funny Story</a>.  If she chooses the right roles, this girl could really be something special.  As for the rest of the cast, the characters are so two-dimensional they're almost irrelevant.  Freddie Highmore just channels Zac Efron and cries more.  Seriously, I don't understand how anyone could praise his performance, it's just sort of there.

The Art of Getting By is the perfect title for this film.  It describes itself.  The characters were unlikable and the script meanders about.  If you're a fan of Emma Roberts, I'd still give it a view, but everyone else is better off watching other far superior films in this genre such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocket-Science/dp/B000YEROYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocket Science</a>&nbsp;.",1323907200,5,2452,5.8923512747875355

4857454,4,B005PTMPYK,"The 411:

Freddie plays George a senior in high school with a lot on his mind. He is deep, thoughtful and artistic probably something that isn't too far from the real Freddie! Emma is a popular senior who befriends Freddie after he takes the blame for something she does. He is used to being the problem and figured he would take the fall instead of her.

Some of the reviews talk about how ""scattered"", ""mopey"" ""dreadful"" or ""self centered"" this movie is, but I will tell you none of that!

Freddie and Emma are wonderful actors who took a dreary, slow, somber script about coming of age as teens about to embark on a new path in life and gave it life!

Freddie Highmore who we have all come to love in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Arthur and the Invisibles, August Rush, Finding Neverland is right up there with Dakota Fanning as far as acting chops. I cannot wait to see how far he does. He has grown into a tall child (5'10) and has border Zac Efron looks.

Emma Roberts is Kristen Stewart without the awkwardness and quiet mannerisms.

Freddie's George is a deep, thoughtful, smart boy who has way too much going on in his artistic head. The weight of his family life and his unsure movement into manhood creates a tornado of emotions that he doesn't have the tools to deal with. The secondary characters, especially in his school Blair Underwood, Alicia Silverstone, Jarloth Conroy are wonderful. My favorite moments of the movie were with his teachers and principles.

I was sobbing in his last scene with Jarloth Conroy!

Freddie is AMAZING so forget about all the other reviews and see this for what it is...a stepping stone of an amazing actor moving from children's movies into adult movies.",1322697600,,1708,4.6138613861386135

George (Highmore) is a high schooler who has pretty much given up. Bitter with the world and his mother he refuses to do anything and hasn't done a real day's work in his entire senior year. He meets Sally (Roberts) who sees the same thing in herself. This is a very good movie made better by the acting. Highmore, in a departure from his usual disgustingly good boy roles is excellent in this. Roberts, who is fast becoming a better actress then her aunt is, is also fantastic in this movie. The role of George is written to be a total jerk to most people he meets, but Highmore has enough ""baggage"" with him that even though he is not nice to almost everyone in the movie you still wind up rooting for him and wanting him to succeed by the end. That is a rare thing for an actor that young. While this is a very good movie that forces you to keep watching it does tend to drag in a few places, but not enough to be boring. If that makes sense. Overall, a very good movie with great acting that is a definite watch. The type of movie that all high schoolers should watch. I give it a B+.
