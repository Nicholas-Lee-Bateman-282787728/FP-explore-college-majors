BUT A FEW EPISODES FROM THOSE SEASONS ARE MISSING.  WHERE IS THE ONE WHEN JJ IS SUPPOSE TO MARRY  DEBBIE ALLEN'S CHARACTER OR THE EPISODE WHEN JJ MIGHT HAVE VD (WITH A YOUNG JAY LENO), OR EVEN THE EPISODE WHEN FLORIDA'S NEPHEW VISITS AND IS WANTED BY THE FBI.  THERE ARE ABOUT AT LEAST 10 OR SO EPISODES FROM THOSE SEASONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FOR MY COLLECTION.

1841637,5,B00008EY6L,"Ok, If you're a fan, you'll remember this as the comic grace that JJ said as they had dinner with a guest who was so poor she ate dog food.
The second season of GT (1974-75) was a good combination of biting commentary of the realities of ghetto life with an amazing sense of humor. The Gang Episode (where JJ gets shot-don't worry, he lived) is not to be confused with the post-John Amos episode where Michael joins a gang. One episode features a very young Debbie Allen as JJ's girlfriend who turns out to be a dope addict.
Overall, the show did a good job in waking America up to what was happening across the tracks, but after this season, John Amos would leave and aside from a few really special episodes, it would lack punch and descend into cornball insult humor (particularly when Johnny Brown joined the cast as ""Bookman."")
But that was still in the future at this point. Take a trip back to a VERY REALISTIC look at an aspect of African-Ameircan life thirty years ago. Aside from rap music and cell phones, not much has changed.",1076976000,,1038,4.439790575916231

John Amos was the way I remember Pops Being back in the day. RIP Esther Rolle she truly was something else. Janet Dubois on time always. Ralph Carter the brother  was very Gifted&on Point on the show. Jimmy Walker Kid DYN-O-Mite always had a spark. Bernadette Stanis(Thelma) I still got a Crush on her. I'll always Love me some Thelma.

1841925,5,B00008EY6L,"Good Times was a revolutionary and groundbreaking Norman Lear sitcom spun off from Maude. While the series is about the Evans family in the Chicago projects, the family is led by parents, Florida Evans (Esther Rolle who played the role in Maude) and her husband, James Evans Sr (John Amos). They have three children, James Jr. or J.J. (Jimmie Walker) who is a teenage artist; teenage aspiring dancer and actress Thelma; and 12 year old militant midget Michael Evans Esquire. They also have friend and neighbor, Willona Woods (played by Janet Dubois).

This sitcom was revolutionary because they were according to Esther Rolle to feature the first African American mother and father in an African American household in the 1970s. The second season was full-length with over 24 episodes of laughter, love, and tears. There are plenty of well-known guest stars like Carl Weathers, Charlotte Rae, Stymie Beard, Lou Gossett Jr., Frances Foster, Helen Walker, Roscoe Lee Browne, Marguerite Ray, etc.,

Every episode is memorable and worth watching multiple times. The series was never the same after James Sr. was killed off in the fourth season. The early three seasons show why killing him off was probably one of the biggest mistakes in television history. This season featured serious issues and dilemmas about J.J. getting arrested; J.J. joining a gang; teenage alcoholism; poverty; unemployment; financial issues; and more.

Every family, black or white or whatever, can relate to the Evans family regardless of your economic situation and address. This series was never the same without James Sr. This season shows why he was such a grand loss. James Evans Sr. was one of the best fathers in television comedies ever.",1420070400,,1718,5.128571428571429

1841994,5,B00008EY6L,"The Evans family continues living life in the projects, getting by the best way they can. ""Good Times - The Complete Second Season"" features many fine moments, such as J.J. wanting to paint a portrait of a young woman as a present for her husband in ""The Nude"" & with James opening a fix-it shop in the apartment in the episode ""The Family Business"". In this Second Season, we see the character of building superintendent Nathan Bookman (played by Johnny Brown) being featured more prominently. Bookman stoops to no end to give the Evans family a difficult time, & it all unfolds with hilarious results. The serious moments continue in the episode ""The Gang"" - a two-part episode where J.J. is confronted by street gang members, who force J.J. to join against his will. A friend of Thelma's has a drinking problem in ""Sometimes There's No Bottom In The Bottle"" & J.J. finds himself joining the army in ""The Enlistment"", after James is laid-off from his job. Michael (Ralph Carter) has an opportunity at a chance of attending a better school in the suburbs in ""Crosstown Buses Run All Day, Doodah, Doodah"" & Thelma (Bern Nadette Stanis) has a chance of attending an exclusive all-girls school in ""Thelma's Scholarship"". Michael refuses to take a specialized test in ""The I.Q. Test"", & Florida deals with emotional issues in ""Florida Flips"". There's much to be seen & viewed in this delightful Second Season of ""Good Times"". You'll want to include ""Good Times - The Complete Second Season"" in your must-have DVD library ASAP!

1842129,5,B00008EY6L,"Nominated for three Golden Globes, Good Times premiered in mid-season 1974 to widespread critical acclaim and audience popularity. A spin-off of the Bea Arthur (of Golden Girls fame) sitcom Maude (1972), Good Times became the fourth of five highly successful sitcoms brought into being during the 1970's decade by Norman Lear. In addition to Maude, those sitcoms were All In The Family (1971), Sanford & Son (1972), and The Jeffersons (1975). The second of three to focus exclusively on African-American family life, Good Times became a source for groundbreaking social commentary in compliment to its penchant for hilarious family comedy...

Good Times centers around the lives of James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), an African-American couple raising their three children in a Chicago housing development. Eldest son J.J. (Jimmie Walker) is a skinny, wisecracking ladies man with an affinity for painting. Middle child Thelma (BernNadette Stanis) plays the role of moderating influence on the passions of her two brothers, while youngest son Michael (Ralph Carter) is always involved in a cause to help others or end an injustice. The family is often visited by Florida's best friend from high school, Willona (Ja'net DuBois), who also lives in the project. In later seasons, she's accompanied by adopted daughter Penny (Janet Jackson). With additional comic relief provided by overweight super Nathan Bookman (Johnny Brown), Good Times is a family-oriented TV series laden with great one-liners and plenty of laugh-tracks...

The Good Times (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Florida Flips"" in which Florida's erratic behavior causes the family and her best friend Willona to question what's wrong with her. Michael thinks that menopause in the root cause, while Willona thinks that it's Florida's boredom with the daily routine of being a housewife... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Person I Most Admire"" in which Michael is tasked with writing a school essay on the person he most admires, prompting him to choose between James and Florida, and ""Florida's Big Gig"" in which James takes Florida along on a job interview where she's offered the job instead of him...

1842130,5,B00008EY6L,"I am a huge fan of ""Good Times"".I wasn't born until 1979, however I still love the show. Even 30 years later I can relate to the Evans family struggles to pay the bills. They kept it real, and did not try to sugarcoat anything. I used to catch the reruns on tv, which are few. I am so gald it's on DVD. I absolutely loved James Evans, he is the type of father that is needed in 2005 to keep kids in line! I recommend Season 2, and all the seasons. Truly funny, with good messages mixed in! Add this to your cart, you'll be glad you did!",1111795200,2,536,3.926605504587156
1842131,5,B00008EY6L,"This is the season where the characters became a little more defined. James Evans became a more reasonable character,little Michael's militant ways became more toned down and for better or worse JJ's overuse of the dy-no-mite catch phrase begins here. But the show is definately at it's peak. A great moment from this season is the one in whitch a blind salesman tries to scam the Evan's into buying a set on encyclopedia's on black history. Also of note is a visit from a neighbor who's been known for eating dog food and the family's reaction to her meatloaf. The look of a TV classic finding itself.",1108771200,,602,4.635514018691588
1842132,4,B00008EY6L,I'm looking for the season with Janet Jackson in them.  I have bought the 1st and 3rd season but I can't find anything that says she's in them.,1095206400,,143,4.107142857142857
1842133,5,B00008EY6L,"I think That Good times is an excellent picture to look at. As black people it shows us where we come from, and it is actually a real life story.  However I would really like to see all the epesodes that janet jackson was on(Penny), and would like to know when will another one hit our stores.  Thank you and keep up the good pic.",1087344000,,330,4.061538461538461
1842134,5,B00008EY6L,"What an eventful and hilarious year it was as Good Times cruised through its second season.  The show had settled in to its unique groove by this point, with each character and his/her place in the show well-defined.  There was an evident focus on J.J. and his comedic genius, but it never came close to the extremes that we would witness in later years.  Michael doesn't get quite as much screen time or lines as J.J. and Thelma, but everyone, including Willona, made their mark on the show in Season Two.  Florida is the central figure who often steers the action and dialogue from point to point, but clearly James Evans is the real star of the show.  When I was young, I didn't like James very much because he always seemed to be yelling, and that scared me (hey, I was very young at the time).  I thought I knew all about this show, having seen so many episodes in syndication 10-15 years ago, but I have really been amazed by John Amos' performance as I revisit the Evans household today.  He truly was the heart and soul of this show in its first three seasons.
How eventful was Season Two?  Well, to start things off, Florida flips out with the housewife blues and later decides to go back to school and get her high school diploma.  Michael gets selected to attend a better school across town but refuses to go, opening a debate on the merits of busing; in the same vein, Michael later refuses to take an IQ test in what is the only weak episode of the season.  Hold on, I'm getting to the big stuff.  How's this?  J.J. gets arrested for robbing a liquor store on his eighteenth birthday, gets forcefully recruited into a gang and winds up getting shot, starts dating a rich girl whose parents do not approve of his lack of monetary means, decides to enlist in the Army, and seriously considers getting married.  Thelma wins a scholarship to a fancy school for girls, perfects the art of burning oatmeal, and brings home the biggest surprise of all - a fianc&eacute;e who is old enough to be her father.  Along the way, the family has to deal with an alcoholic relative as well as an old friend who turns out to be a gambler on the lam, and James and Florida get the shock of their lives when they finally get to meet J.J.'s main squeeze Henrietta.  James delivers some amazing performances, especially during times of crisis when someone in the family is in danger, either physically or emotionally.  He should have won an Emmy just for the second episode of J.J. Becomes a Man, but he proved himself to be the consummate actor each and every episode.  Sure, James yelled a lot, but he was a good husband and father in every sense of the words and always put his family first.
There are some unforgettably hilarious episodes in Season Two.  The Windfall, an episode in which James becomes a celebrity after returning a bag full of stolen money (only to get the least of rewards for his noble deed) is a classic.  Then there's The Nude, in which J.J. plans to paint a nude portrait of the new head-turning neighbor upstairs, and The Enlistment, featuring J.J.'s incredibly funny physical exam in preparation for his enlistment in the Army.  The prize, of course, goes to The Dinner Party.  In this memorable episode, an older neighbor is suffering through some hard times financially and, as the Evans family learns, has resorted to eating dog food.  They invite her to eat dinner with them, only to see her show up with a special meatloaf she cooked herself.  Watching the family try to avoid taking a single bite of that meatloaf makes for one of the funniest scenes in television history.
Even through all the histrionics and non-stop laughter, Good Times dealt with some serious issues in a very constructive manner.  This was about as reality-based a sit com as TV would ever offer.  While it was not truly realistic of ghetto life in the 1970s, the characters and problems the Evans family had to deal with week in and week out were rooted in reality, and the strong bond that held this family together made them a model family whom audiences of all sorts could relate to, look up to, and enjoy bringing into their homes each and every week.  You don't get any special features with the 3-DVD set, but these 24 episodes are more than enough to delight those of us who grew up with Good Times and to win the show many a new fan among those who are too young to have been exposed to this timeless sit com before.  The show just gets funnier and funnier as time goes by.",1086652800,13,4482,4.487684729064039
1842135,5,B00008EY6L,"Thank goodness....they FINALLY put out Good Times S. 2!  It only took a year!!!  This show has become one of the 1970s classic hits...and with good reason!  It conveys the plight of the poor in a light, airy manner....coping with hard issues by using a smile and a laugh.  Even though it may seem dated at times, the things that Good Times addresses are still somewhat prevalent today...and of course...that's why it is considered a classic.
In this new season, the characters are more defined...and the actors seem more at ease with their roles.  Of course, the highlights are Michael ""the militant midget"" and JJ.
So, go ahead, get yourself some Good Times while you can!  I sure hope the third season will come a little quicker though!!",1080000000,2,739,4.734375
1842136,5,B00008EY6L,"Oh Michael, you crazy kid. Black this, black that, black power left, black power right. This kid was so in tune with black issues, I bet people used to watch this show just for the news. Of course we have a woman named Florida who gave birth to this little militant. She's a God fearing woman who does not in any way shape or form condone Black Jesus (It's Willy the Wino!!)
The best feature of this show was of course the daughter. She was a funky fresh mama that was fit to be tied. She had a wild, scraggily fro and a pair of breasts that just said 'BAMM!!' I like to watch her run out of the bedroom in her tight ghetto sweaters.
Good Times! Any time you make a payment!",1079049600,2,674,4.075187969924812

Trivia:
*When Good Times started (1974), J.J and Thelma, who were supposed to be in high school, were in real life, 27 and 21 respectively!  Michael was actually 13.
*Esther Rolle and John Amos were actually 19 years apart.  Esther was 54 and John was 35.
*John Amos (James Evans) left the show after the 3rd season.  He was written off the show as having died in a car accident while in Mississippi where he found a good job.  The character of Carl Dixon (Moses Gunn) that is introduced in late season 4, proposes to Florida and she accepts.
*Esther Rolle left Good Times during season 5 because of unhappiness with the show's direction and of the J.J. character.  She was written out of the season as being away on her honeymoon with Carl.  She returned as Florida, the rock of the Evans family, for season 6, which was the final season.
Esther Rolle (1920-1998)
Moses Gunn (1929-1993)
