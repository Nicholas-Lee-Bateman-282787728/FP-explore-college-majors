7912005,3,B00000JGHY,"If you fancy a trip to the great pre-Spanish cities of Mexico, this video will treat you to a tour of the art and mystery of Cholulu, Tula, Tenochtitlan, and a half-dozen other cities built by a people who had mastered technology to a fine degree---making buildings that behaved like calendars, for instance---but whose mastery of other peoples makes the Spanish conquest look rather tame by comparison.  Of particular interest is the claimed coincidence of the Aztec concept of an ""end time"" with the arrival of the Spanish conquerors exactly as scheduled.  Brief explanations of games, rituals (with current re-enactments), and current mysteries compete with lengthier descriptions of a 18th-century explorer's tribulations as he searched out new cities.  The cinematography is superb, featuring great close-ups in raking light of finely carved details on walls and monuments, and well-lit landscape views showing the buildings in their settings.
This is a good introduction to a great people's history---and a nice incidental introduction to some of southern Mexico's geography.  I found it easier to understand how some of today's unrest in the state of Chiapas may have historical roots after seeing this video.  The only drawback to the video is a somewhat slow narrative pace.",988675200,12,1283,5.3316831683168315

7912007,4,B00000JGHY,"This is a great video with only a few minor flaws.  It tells the history of the Maya and Aztec in a very interesting fashion, from the discovery by the Spanish backward in time.  This however, is confusing for those not  familiar with the timelines of these cultures and I found it bothersome.  Even so, I thought it was a great presentation, especially the computer  animations of how these mavelous cities must have appeared at their peak.  The many incredible shots of ruins, the story of how they were rediscovered  in the 19th century by explorers, and great computer animations make this a  great video for the entire family.  We purchased this as a Christmas  present and have watched it over and over.",946512000,14,709,4.691056910569106
