8224117,3,B000WMFZLU,"On the 11th day of Christmas 2016 I'm going to review...WWE Armageddon 2007.  The United States Championship match: MVP vs. Rey Mysterio had a cheap finish to an otherwise cookie cutter match. The ECW Champion CM Punk and Kane vs. Big Daddy V (with Matt Striker) and Mark Henry tag match was a formula tag bout, but I was pleasantly surprised by what an effective team Henry and BDV were. The Mr. Kennedy vs. Shawn Michaels match was good because HBK once again proved himself to be an in-ring genius as he lead Kennedy to a stellar performance. The Intercontinental Championship match: Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H was technically a sound match here which told a nice story of Hardy stepping up. The The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh) vs. Finlay (with Hornswoggle) match was a one star classic and I'm being nice. The WWE Championship match: Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho had a dumb finish to an otherwise exciting, competitive match. The Women's Championship match: Beth Phoenix vs. Mickie James was a pleasant divas match here, as these two usually deliver the goods. The World Heavyweight Championship match: Batista vs. Edge vs. The Undertaker was surprisingly brief main event, but it packed plenty of action into it. The finish worked here. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1482537600,,1274,4.764705882352941

Best Match: Batista vs. Edge vs. Undertaker
Worst Match: Finlay/Khali

Overall, this card has a overall better than average quality to it. HBK/Kennedy is a solid singles affair, as well as Triple H/Jeff Hardy. Mysterio/MVP is a high-flying opener, with Punk/Kane BDV/Henry being good as well. The Women's Championship match with James/Phoenix is average, and the only true clunker on the card is Finlay/Khali. Orton and Jericho proved Jericho had a slight amount of rust, but the JBL DQ finish was kind-of stupid in my view.

For a cheap price, this is a good DVD to own.",1354233600,,686,4.846153846153846

8224120,4,B000WMFZLU,"United States Championship Match: MVP (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio
This should have been a classic bout, and for the most part, it was. MVP is a great heel and there was plenty of solid wrestling from both competitors, and the high-flying wonders of Rey Mysterio are still awe-inspiring. Mysterio did mess up a springboard Seated Senton at one point, but he did amaze us with a springboard super hurracarana as well as a split-legged springboard moonsault on MVP. A head-scissors was just perfectly executed as well. This was a great opening match and it had potential of being a 5/5 match, with plenty of near-falls and excitement throughout, but the match was ruined by a bad finish. After Rey hit a hurrcarana off the apron on MVP on the outside, MVP decided to just stay on the outside and get counted out. He lost the match, but at least he got to retain his title. These two need to go at it again and soon. Winner: Rey Mysterio. Match Rating: 4/5

Big Daddy V and Mark Henry (with Matt Striker) vs. CM Punk and Kane
Surprisingly enough, this match wasn't bad. I was expecting a crapfest, or at the very least, an average showing, but Mark Henry was very impressive and Big Daddy V wasn't even bad. You see, as long as Big Daddy V's wrestling moments are short but powerful, then he's effective, but the WWE tends to put the big guys in long matches where they don't belong, and that's where they screw up. Anyway, there was a lot of back-and-forth between all competitors, and both the big men actually sold to Punk. Punk's offense of kicks and strikes was entertaining to watch, and Kane's expert uppercuts and clotheslines on the big guys, including his signature flying clothesline as well as powerful clotheslines in the corner, also helped the match out. The end came when Punk ran right into a samoan drop from the GIANT Big Daddy V. A solid match with plenty of moments that leave you cringing. Winners: Big Daddy V and Mark Henry. Match Rating: 4/5

Mr. Kennedy vs. Shawn Michaels
Shawn Michaels always brings the best out of performers, whether they be some of the worst in the business, or if they're actually talented like Kennedy happens to be. The match at first was pretty slow but it still managed to be watchable. Things started to get interesting as Michaels started to play the ""focus"" game on, not one of Kennedy's arms or legs or neck like what usually happens, but his HAND. There were some nasty spots like Michaels stomping on Kennedy's hand while it was on the steel steps and jamming his fingers by SLAMMING them down, pointers-first, into the mat! Kennedy sold wonderfully and Michaels beat him around, focusing mainly on his hand, and then Michaels hit his usually offense, after powering out of the Green Bay Plunge, which included his atomic drops, flying forearm, and the Flying Elbow Drop. Unfortunately for Michaels, Kennedy countered the Sweet Chin Music, and then Kennedy dominated a healthy portion of the rest of the match. Kennedy went for his The Mic Check finisher, but Michaels countered by grabbing onto the top rope, but Kennedy nailed the Green Bay Plunge during his second attempt...but Michaels managed to KICK OUT!!! However, Kennedy still put the beating on Michaels, but his hand started to bother him after hitting Michaels a few times in a brilliant turn of wrestling psychology, and then Kennedy ate a Sweet Chin Music and Michaels got the win!!! An awesome match and an extremely smart one. It was brutal and awesome all rolled into one. Winner: Shawn Michaels. Match Rating: 5/5

#1 Contender's WWE Championship Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H
Another 5/5 match right after another. This pay-per-view is AWESOME, and it's not even one of the ""big four"" (SummerSlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, WrestleMania). This match was obviously a way to see how Jeff Hardy would perform in main event matches and how the crowd would react to him, but by god, this match was just amazing. There was deep emotion and psychology throughout the entire contest, with Jeff reluctant to fight Triple H due to their friendship, but with Triple H treating him with tough love and SMACKING Hardy so hard across the face it practically shook my TV off the entertainment center! As the match progressed, Hardy started getting into the groove of things and SMACKED Triple H right back! There was a lot of exciting moments and the match didn't slow down a single time. Everything was done expertly by two of the best the wrestling business has ever seen. Hell, Hardy even botched a his flying clothesline he does after running on the security barricades, but Triple H made us all forget about that when he hit Hardy with a thunderous clothesline on the outside that had Hardy smacking his head on the mat! Triple H countered the Twist of Fate at one point into a spectactulary DDT, only to get two. Hardy managed to battle out of the Pedigree, but Triple H countered a Swanton Bomb attempt, and he also managed to dodge Hardy's mule kick in the corner. The end came fast and just as exciting as the rest of the bout when Triple H countered a Twist of Fate by pushing Hardy into the ropes, hitting Hardy with the spinebuster, and then when he went for the Pedigree, Hardy rolled him up out of nowhere and got the win!!! A great ending to a great match. Winner: Jeff Hardy. Match Rating: 5/5

Finlay (with Hornswoggle) vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)
This is one of the matches that you expect to be god awful. Thankfully for all of us, this most definitely isn't the case. The match at Survivor Series a month prior between Khali and Hornswoggle was most obviously a joke, but this match had plenty of highs, like when Khali was dominating Finlay with powerful chops, and when Khali missed a chop on Finlay that caused his hand to smack on the steel ring post. Finlay attempted to cheat at one point using the shillelagh, but Khali caught him around the throat! While the ref disposed of the shillelagh, Hornswoggle ran into the ring with another shillelagh, hit Khali in the groin with it, tossed it to Finlay, and then Finlay smashed it over Khali's head! Finlay tossed the shillelagh out of the ring and pinned Khali for the victory! It was short and sweet, and it proves that, once again, the really big men in wrestling can be entertaining if they are used in short bursts instead of grated down to yawnfests. Winner: Finlay. Match Rating: 4/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho
Usually when a match has a crappy finish, I tend to knock it down a point, as it's just annoying when matches end in disqualification or count-out, and it can really suck a lot of the feeling from the match. However, Jericho and Orton give a stupendous performance. Jericho countered Orton's DDT off the second rope by trying to lock on the Walls of Jericho, but Orton managed to power out of the submission hold. Orton ate an insiguri from Jericho, but when Jericho went for the Lionsault, Orton countered by getting his knees up. Jericho countered the RKO and there was plenty of high-flying and exciting offense from him, but then the fight spilled to the outside. Orton tossed Jericho over the SmackDown! announce table, and Jericho smashed right into JBL! Poor JBL. Anyway, the match went back into the ring, where Orton ate a bulldog and even a Lionsault, but STILL KICKED OUT!!! Jericho went for the Codebreaker, but Orton countered, and then he went for the concussion punt, but Jericho managed to dodge it and then roll Orton up...but then he turned his pin attempt INTO THE WALLS OF JERICHO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING!!! Orton tried to grab for the ropes...BUT JERICHO PULLED HIM AWAY...oh, but then JBL ran into the ring and hit a big boot on Jericho. Lame ending to an otherwise PHENOMENAL match. These two need to feud again. They work brilliantly together. Winner: Chris Jericho. Match Rating: 5/5

Women's Championship Match: Beth Phoenix (Champion) vs. Mickie James
After this match got over, I realized there wasn't a single bad match on the entire card. While this match isn't good by any means, it still manages to be average. Mickie James's energetic in-ring offense is entertaining to watch and Beth Phoenix's monster strength is reminiscent of Chyna. Regardless, there was some basic offense that you would expect from these two, though Phoenix did lock on a rather unique submission hold at one point. Poor Mickie fell to a delayed fisherman's suplex by Phoenix. The ending was rather anti-climatic, but the rest of the match was admittedly pretty decent. Winner: Beth Phoenix. Match Rating: 3/5

Triple Threat World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista (Champion) vs. Edge vs. The Undertaker
This match probably shouldn't have been the main event, but it was still pretty good. There was a lot more expectations going into this bout, but the Undertaker/Batista well has sort of run dry by this point, with the two facing at WrestleMania 23 with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line, in a steel cage match on SmackDown!, in a Last Man Standing Match at Backlash, at another match at Cyber Sunday with Special Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin, and just last month at Survivor Series in a phenomenal Hell in a Cell bout. Unfortunately, most of the match was Batista/Undertaker, though the moments where Edge got involved were very unique and entertaining. There was a lot of psychology when it came to Edge, as both Batista and Undertaker wanted him for their own to beat up. Edge ate a Chokeslam and virtually disappeared from the match, only reappearing after a powerful superplex had both men out. Batista and Undertaker countered one another's finishing moves, and at one point Undertaker locked on the Hell's Gates on Batista, only to relinquish the hold after Edge rang the bell to make Undertaker think Batista tapped. Edge then ran into the ring and hit the Spear on Undertaker while he argued with the ref, only to get two! Edge then hit the Spear on Batista to, once again, only come up with the two count. A frustrated Edge got a pair of steel chairs from ringside and hit the Conchairto on Batista, but he was then ejected from the match following another Chokeslam. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder then crawled out from under the ring and acted as Edge clones, running into the match as Batista and Undertaker did their all-too-familiar thing, but they were both attacked by Undertaker, him believing that they were Edge. Undertaker hit the Tombstone Piledriver on Batista, and then the real Edge ran into the ring with a steel chair, smacked Undertaker in the back and head with it, and then pinned Batista for the win. Blah finish to match that was mostly just mind games and stuff we've already seen. Still, it was entertaining, surprising, and there was some solid wrestling in there, and it still managed to be a good showing, just not main event material. Winner: Edge. Match Rating: 4/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS
There was mostly just interviews and stuff here, but there was some touching moments with Jeff Hardy celebrating after he beat Triple H. The aftermath of the Orton/Jericho match ended a bit stupidly after Jericho ate an RKO and didn't even get to use his brand new move the Codebreaker on Orton. Jillian Hall gave a ""performance"" that was actually pretty funny to watch, and I really can't complain here. The wrestling was just so solid that any of the silliness that we're used to honestly wasn't that needed...though the 619 that Mysterio hit on MVP after MVP got counted out was pretty delicious. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS
Instead of hyping up the next pay-per-view like the Extras tend to do, we get a little clip from Raw's 15th Anniversary. In the clip, you see Vince McMahon declare himself as the Greatest Raw Superstar of the last 15 years. I'm not going to ruin the rest for you, but there ya go. It's not as great as you'd expect, but it's not really all that shabby either. Rating: 4/5

OVERALL EVENT
AWESOME! This is one of the best pay-per-views I've ever seen. There wasn't a bad match throughout the entire evening, with the only bout holding it back from perfect status being the women's match. That's a shame, too, considering both James and Phoenix can usually give pretty damn good performances most of the time. Orton and Jericho really need to go at it again and the Hardy/Triple H and Kennedy/Michaels matches were all very entertaining. I wouldn't mind seeing another MVP/Mysterio feud either, by the way.",1248912000,,12451,4.7415782187355795
8224121,4,B000WMFZLU,"2007 was a pretty rough year for the WWE.  Only since John Cena's sudden injury derailed the plans for the ""No Mercy 2007"" PPV in October has the WWE been forced to rethink their strategies, successfully.  The last few PPVs have been worthy events, with ""Armageddon 2007"" bringing the year to a good close.

1) U.S. Championship - MVP (champion) v. Rey Mysterio
---What an exceptional opener!  Porter and Rey give us one of the evening's best matches.  MVP continues to improve his character and his wrestling ability, while Mysterio knows how to be an underdog and a phenomenal competitor.  I am tired of MVP losing his title matches by DQ or countout, but this pleasant surprise has some crisp counters and high-risk offense from both men.
""8.0 out of 10"" (if it weren't this good, I'd hate the countout finish, too)

2) CM Punk (ECW champion) & Kane v. Big Daddy V & Mark Henry
---I actually kind of got into this match for a while.  Punk and Kane as underdogs is a neat concept, because you believe every slam they end up receiving.  I thought all four men did a decent job.  My actual gripe is that the match runs on too long.  I'm glad to see ECW finally get some decent PPV airtime, but the match's novelty outlasted its welcome.
""6.0 out of 10"" (not bad, but way too long)

3) Shawn Michaels v. Mr. Kennedy
---I thought these two could mesh well together, but I didn't think they would give the BEST MATCH OF THE YEAR!  Yes, you read that right.  A simple grudge match with no titles or high stakes stole the PPV.  What's great about this is the storytelling.  The injuries that Kennedy and HBK sustain throughout the contest play into every move they do.  Kennedy's hurt arm forces him to use his other hand to fight, while Michaels' beaten-up back keep him even more grounded than HBK usually is.  From start to finish, the little details play out.  An outstanding technical matchup that rivals any Angle/Benoit, Bret/Owen, or Flair/Steamboat match I've seen.
""9.0 out of 10"" (Best Match Of The Year!)

4) #1 Contender Match - Jeff Hardy (IC champion) v. Triple H
---We've got a double-edged sword here.  There's some nice psychology here as Jeff doesn't want to be too physical on HHH (who's willing to do anything to win).  Unfortunately, the match could've been way better.  Most of the match is HHH just pummeling away on Jeff, with Jeff only being able to make a few comebacks to stay in the match.  Ironically, HHH's dominance is more interesting than Jeff's underdog story.  When the match reaches its final stretch, it's the same signature reversals and maneuvers you've seen both men do for years.  I love the emotions that Jeff and HHH brought to the match, but I wish Jeff Hardy's rise to the WWE Title hunt was more convincing.
""7.0 out of 10"" (Good match, but Jeff Hardy barely does anything)

5) Finlay v. The Great Khali
---This is exactly what you think it would be.  I thought Finlay worked his heart out, which made this a lot more entertaining than most Khali matches are.  I feel bad trashing this giant because it's almost too easy, but the bottom line is that Finlay totally saved this David/Goliath match from being total garbage.
""6.0 out of 10"" (God bless Finlay for being able to pull this off)

6) WWE Championship - Chris Jericho v. Randy Orton (champion)
---First off, this is a very good match by two hard-working superstars, and it deserves to be remembered as such.  But there are certain conditions for giving it a high recommendation.  One of them is the DQ finish; it's a surprising turn-of-events for a change, but the WWE might've dug a hole with Jericho when they gave him a title shot so soon.  I'm also pretty upset that live audiences don't seem to to dig Y2J's return; then again, maybe it's a quiet resepct and not boredom.  For the most part, I witnessed a well-executed match that didn't inspire much enthusiasm from the Pittsburgh crowd.
""8.0 out of 10"" (A great underappreciated match -- I'm more upset at the quiet crowd than the DQ finish)

7) Women's Championship - Mickie James v. Beth Phoenix (champion)
---Speaking of appreciation: I'm getting really sick of crowds not giving hard-working women like Phoenix and Mickie the respect they deserve.  This isn't a great match, but the women's division is finally on the rise with good performances by a few talented athletes.  I'm not giving this a very high score because Mickie James and Beth Phoenix should've been given more of an opportunity than this, considering they're (arguably) the best working Divas today.  But for the short while it lasts, it's not boring.
""5.5 out of 10"" (short and sweet; I look forward to more from the Divas)

8) World Heavyweight Championship - Batista (champion) v. Edge v. Undertaker
---Let's get something straight before I ramble: This is an entertaining Triple Threat Match that plays better on DVD than as a live PPV broadcast.
Having said that, this evening's main event is a huge ripoff!  I loved Taker and Batista's 2007 rivalry, and I couldn't wait for Edge's return to ""SmackDown"".  As the match plays out, there's barely any 3-way action, meaning mostly one-on-one wrestling.  That's actually okay because Taker & Batista won't let the other get their revenge, first, which makes Edge's role very entertaining.  The match itself is entertaining enough.  But in the final stretch, disappointment sinks in.  The whole ""EdgeHead"" switcharoo is poorly broadcast and presented.  Either the WWE crew was trying to confuse us, or the camera team just missed the shots.  Seriously, Hawkins and Ryder just show up out of nowhere.  It all happens so fast that we can't even understand what's happened.  Michael Cole & Tazz can't even make sense out of what's going on!  Even more offensive is the 12 minute length.  That's right --- one of 2007's best feuds comes to a close in 12 minutes!  This PPV had about 15-20 minutes of airtime, so why so short of a length?  Of all the travesties and disappointing PPV presentations, the Undertaker/Batista/Edge triangle was the one we could all count on to pull us through.  It's so rare to see a rivalry run on for a long time AND sustain its momentum.  Now that the WWE has gotten back on track, it hurts to see this huge opportunity just get tossed aside.
If you're watching this for the first time on DVD, and just sorta catching up, this main event may be more forgivable.  But if you're one of the loyal WWE fans who really keeps track of the storylines and potential storylines, I think you'll be disappointed.
""6.5 out of 10"" (Never boring, but the confusing finish doesn't work, and 12 minutes for this rivalry is totally unacceptable)

OVERALL
The biggest problem with the PPV is nothing really important happens: Three Titles don't change hands, while the 4th title's change was poorly executed.  I doubt the Jericho/JBL feud will go onto greatness (though they haven't done too bad so far).  And finally, even though I really want people to see the Kennedy/HBK matchup, you shouldn't buy a whole PPV just to watch it.  It's great, but people are likely to forget about it months from now.

I'm gonna give ""Armageddon 2007"" 4 stars because there are some good matches on here.  But this PPV might be destined to be a stepping to better things.  Let's hope the WWE has a great year in 2008.  If the improvements this late in 2007 are of any indiciation, we could be in for a fun ride.",1202860800,,7383,4.6656346749226
8224122,4,B000WMFZLU,"United States Champion M.V.P. vs. Rey Mysterio - This was a good opener but we've seen better performances from these two as the match didn't seem to kick into ""high gear"" & was missing that ""it"" factor that usually makes their matches great to watch. The ending was a jip & came off as very weak since it didn't really look like MVP was in serious trouble thoughout the match...not to mention the fact also that the same ending was done 2 PPV's earlier at Cyber Sunday.

Kane & C.M. Punk vs. Big Daddy V & Mark Henry - Henry & V dominated the smaller C.M. Punk thoughout the opening minutes before Kane came in & held his own against the two.  In the end, Punk was squashed by V.  Average match but it's better than any Mark Henry/Daddy V match I can recently remember as they told a good story here.

Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. Kennedy - Great match with both men selling their injuries thoughout the bout (Kennedy's hand & HBK's back) along with times both men trying to outsmart each other countermove for countermove.  Look out for the sequence that started with Kennedy trying to come off the top rope that led to Kennedy finally dropping an elbow on HBK's back as a pefect example of that.  This was my favorite match of the night & this was the type of PPV performance that we haven't seen from Kennedy since this time last year for one reason or another.

Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H - This was all about Triple H making Jeff Hardy step his game up as the beginning had Hardy hold back a punch before Triple H slapped him & yelled for Hardy to ""FIGHT ME!"" before Hardy returned the slap to Triple H.  From here, they went back & forth with each other with Triple H getting more aggressive every time it looked like Hardy would make a comeback.  Great match that served it's purpose in elevating Hardy to the main event.

Finlay vs. Great Khali - Who would have ever thought that Finlay would be a babyface in WWE...and that people would actually be standing up & cheering him?  Anyways, the only part of the match worth talking about was the ending where Finlay's shillelagh was taken by the referee before Hornswoggle came in & low blowed Khali with his own shillelagh before Finlay got the win.  It's a Khali match so you basically know to heavily lower your expectations but the match was more watchable than his entire World Title reign.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho - This was another good match here as I didn't see any ""ring rust"" from Jericho who broke out some of his old moves during the match like the Lionsault & Walls Of Jericho while constantly countering Orton's RKO.  The finish was something that I honestly didn't expect as J.B.L. cost Jericho the title with another DQ ending based off what happened between them on the outside of the ring. As an interesting side note, the second title match of the night had the same finish as the title match from Cyber Sunday...same case for the first title match as well.

Womens Champion Beth Phoenix vs. Mickie James - Before the match gets started, Brooke Hoga...I mean, Jillian Hall came out to plug her iTunes Christmas album (William Hung's got competition!) and made everyone's ears bleed with ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.""  As for the match itself, it was real short with Beth using her powermoves (I guess she's suppost to be the next Chyna) while Mickie was able to get in some offense at times like two Thesz presses, dropkick to the face & head scissors out the corner.  Again, it was too short to get into.

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker vs. Edge - This match perfectly illistrated why Edge is my favorite heel.  He played up his ""ultimate opportunitst"" label as he was avoiding Taker at the start, running away when Taker & Batista were fighting over who gets their hands on Edge, and trying to steal the pin after Taker legdropped Batista on the apron.  The match never got slow & as just nonstop action the entire time with the ending involving Edge ""having the strength of 3 men"" was something.  Edge stole another World Championship in the end.

The only DVD extras was just a highlight of Vince McMahon naming himself the greatest superstar in RAW history on the RAW 15th anniversary show (a blind man can see that one coming) before Mankind, Undertaker, and Austin beat him up & everyone celebrated in the ring.

Overall, this was a really good show and concidering how horrible to average the PPV's were in 2007 for one reason or another, this was really a standout event for the year that I recommend for a viewing.  Some of the finishes were a jip but the wrestling is there to enjoy for the most part.",1200182400,,4618,4.509592326139089
8224123,4,B000WMFZLU,"MVP vs Rey Mysterio (US Title Match)

Nice work from both in this match, but the ending was bull#&@. Rey isn't as good as he used to be, but he was still able to pretty much carry this one. Ends when MVP decides he doesn't want to come back to the ring. 2.5/5

CM Punk & Kane vs Mark Henry & Big Daddy V

Why does WWE use Henry & Daddy V so much? It just proves that you can make it, even if you just sit on the couch, eat chips and watch crap like this, you can get to the WWE. Horrible match. Every match that has Daddy V is. 1/5

Shawn Michaels vs Mr. Kennedy

Good, but not great match. Kennedy injured his hand early in the match, and Shawn started to work on it. Sweet Chin Music comes from out of nowhere after Kennedy tries to punch with the injured hand. 3/5

Triple H vs Jeff Hardy (for title shot at Royal Rumble)

It was a good match, but lacked offensive from both sides. Jeff looked like he didn't want to fight, until The Game slapped him. Jeff's win comes out of nowhere. 3.5/5

Finlay vs The Great Khali

Why is Khali in the WWE? He sucks at everything he does, and botches over half of his moves. Like I expected, this match was bad. 1.5/5

Randy Orton vs Chris Jericho (For the WWE Championship)

This match looked like it could be one of the best matches of the year. But the ending came, and ruined it all. Even though I like Orton over Y2J, I think out should've ended to Randy tapping out to the Walls. But no... JBL had to interfere, because Jericho shoved him earlier in the match. Jericho wins with a DQ, but the title doesn't change hands. 3.5/5

Beth Phoenix vs Mickie James (Women's Championship)

These two are probably the most watchable divas on the WWE roster. And not just cause of their looks, but because they're good in the ring too. Nice match. Beth wins. 3.5/5

Batista vs Edge vs Undertaker (World Heavyweight Championship)

Best match of the night, hands down. Some might see the ending as a screwjob, but it was permitted in the rules, and so I don't see it as that. The whole Edge cloning thing was pretty hilarious... turns out it was the Major Brothers (now Curt Hawkins & Zack Ryder). Taker Tombstones Batista, Edge hits Taker to the back with a chair, and pins Batista. Finally someone useful has a title in SD again. 4.5/5

Good PPV, falling short of this years Wrestlemania, No Mercy and Survivor Series.",1200009600,,2353,4.27765237020316

Finally as taker hits the tomstone on batista edge comes under the ring and hits taker with a chair twice and covers batista for the win. This is agood match it was confusing to see 3 edges but I thought the imposters looked like the majour brother.
Winner Edge Rating 9

Overall this is a good PPV and I recommend this to everyone because this is worth your money with matches like HHH/Hardy HBK/Kennedy Taker/Batista/Edge Y2J/Oton and Rey/MVP I hope my review was good for you.",1197763200,3,2738,4.27852998065764

WWE United States Championship match
Rey Misterio vs MVP

They star off the show very good. Rey does his high flying moves thru out match while MVP does some technical moves. They keep the crowd into the match until the end when MVP gets counted out but it was still a good match. 8/10

Kane & CM Punk vs Mark Henry & Big Daddy V

I thought this match was going to suck but hey I was wrong. They kept it at a very nice pace that never got boring. I really liked the ending to the match when CM Punk gets squashed. 7/10

Mr. Kennedy vs Shawn Micheals

Kennedy brought some anger into the match making this match even better. Shawn worked on Kennedys hand and it played thru the entire match. There was a nice spot when Kennedy pushed Shawn into the ring post while onto the apron. Very Good match. 8.5/10

Jeff Hardy vs Triple H

Crowd cant decide who to cheer for. They just start out pretty much brawling . Triple H gives Hardy the loudest slap ever to wake him up and fight. The both of them go back and forth. H tries to go for the pedigree but he countered and won. Then Hardy celebrates. Nice Match 8/10

Finlay vs The Great Khali

By was I surprised about this match. Thought it was slow at one point this was preety okay. It never got boring. Khali whips out some pretty loud chops to Finlay. Hornswaggle got in hear but got thrown out by Khali. Finlay wins by a shot to the head with his trusty shillelagh. 6.5/10

WWE Championship Match
Chris Jericho vs Randy Orton

Jericho looked very average in this match. The crowd was pretty silent on and off. At some points it really looked like Chris Jericho was going to win the match. They both put on a good technical match that was pretty good until the end when JBL comes in and kicks Jericho in the head. After the match Orton RKOd Jericho. 7.5/10

WWE Women Championship Match
Beth Phenoix vs Mickie James
This was pretty average and short. The way I look at the match, it was a squash. 5/10

Triple Threat Match
World Heavyweight Championship Match
Batista vs Edge vs  The Undertaker

I really didn't know who would win this match and got me going. For some reason Batista didn't want Undertaker to touch Edge. They kept it pretty good but got good towards the end, and it also got confusing. Batista and Undertaker brawled until Edge came in and picked up what was left over. 7.5/10

Overall this was a excellent ppv. They also did a funny promo about the royal rumble.",1197763200,2,2491,4.345572354211663
8224126,4,B000WMFZLU,"This is what I believe will happen at the last WWE PPV of the year. It actually appears to be shaping up to be a pretty good card. I was not planning on getting this PPV, but I think I am going to have to based on the card. The matches are put in order of where I think they will be on the card and rate the matches out of 10 based on how good they are.

1. MVP (vs) Rey Mysterio (U.S. Title) - This should be the opener to get the crowd going. I think this will be a short little fued, just while Hardy is out. It will be a good way to start off the show. Mysterio will be using his high flying moves. I think Mysterio will win the match by DQ, as MVP will cause himself to get disqualified at the 9 minute mark. I think they will have a rematch on Smackdown in the beginning of January and end after that. They will both go onto the Rumble and eventually Matt Hardy and MVP will meet up at Mania. Winner: Rey Mysterio by DQ (8/10)

2. CM Punk & Kane (vs) Dig Daddy V & Mark Henry - I think it is very smart to put Kane in this match, just so we don't have Punk one on one with either one of the other two. Kane will get the eventual hot tag in the match and pull off some good moves. Short match at 6 minutes. Winners: Kane and Punk by pinfall (6/10)

3. Shawn Michaels (vs) HBK - I hope this fued continues for awhile. Unfortunatly, I just think it is a short little fued to end the year. This match could end up being fantastic, but I think they will hold up on this one. Eventually these two will meet down the line. However, this match should be very good. There should be a lot of emotion in the match and good back and forth action and intensity between the two. I will give Kennedy the win, although probably unclean. They will probably eventually have a rematch on RAW before the Rumble. Winner: Kennedy by pinfall at 17 minutes (8/10)

4. Beth Phoenix (vs) Mickie James (WWE Women's Title) - Honestly, I don't really care. Winner: Phoenix by pinfall in 8 minutes. (6/10)

5. Triple H (vs) Jeff Hardy (Winner Get a WWE Title Match at Royal Rumble) - I am really anticipating this match. The two styles are very different, but should mix well. This match should be to test if Hardy can move up to that main event status. I think Hardy will pull out all the stops in this one. I think there will be one huge spot in the match. There will be a lot of close falls. I was gonna sway with Hardy, but I am going with Triple H as I don't think he will be facing Orton at Mania anymore. Winner: Triple H by pinfall at 19 minutes (9/10)

6. Finlay (vs) The Great Khali - This should be used to bring the crowd down from the usualy match. Shouldn't be much to it, but will help Finlay's face turn. I will go with Finlay with help from the shalaylay? and Hornswoggle. Winner: Finlay by pinfall at 6 minutes. (6.5/10)

7. Randy Orton (vs) Chris Jericho (WWE Title) - I personally don't like the way Y2J was brought back. Obviously everyone knew he was coming back, but they shouldn't have announced the exact time and place. I also think this match should have been Y2Js first match back. The match could be somewhat mildly entertaining. I think the winner is pretty obvious here. There could be somebody that interferes (and starts a new fued)with Y2J (rumors are he will face JBL at Mania). Winner: Randy Orton by pinfall at 13 minutes (7.5/10)

8. Batista (vs) Edge (vs) Undertaker (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat) - This match is very intriguing because I honestly have no idea who is going to win. I am assuming it is Edge and Taker at Mania, but don't know how it is going to happen. This match should be great however. I think it will eventually turn into somewhat of a Hardcore match with chairs and announce tables. I am going to go with Batista getting the pin on Edge, setting up Taker and Batista at Rumble for the 4th time (I would love to see them go at it again), with Edge winning Rumble and facing Taker at Mania. However for this match. Winner: Batista by pinfall on Edge at 15 minutes(8.5/10)

So there you have it. This could be very good and send us off with a good end to the year and set us up for a great beginning of 2008.",1197504000,,4151,4.146583850931677
