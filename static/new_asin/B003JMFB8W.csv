4131063,5,B003JMFB8W,"I am a flaming, left-wing, populist-libertarian (and a veteran of the American war in Vietnam) -- but I really miss WFB.

He could present the ring-wing, conservative, neo-con positions in an articulate, intelligent and understandable way -- with such a sublime sense of humor.

Rush Limbaugh, David Brooks, Pat Buchanan, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity, ALL PUT TOGETHER, can't hold a candle to WFB.

On the left, I really like Howard Zinn (RIP) and Noam Chomsky.

Malcolm X. Shabazz was the most brilliant and articulate radical during my lifetime.

Now the MSM feeds us pablum to keep us fat, dumb and ''happy'' -- which is so sad for us, but at least we have the Internet (for now anyway).

4131064,5,B003JMFB8W,"While missing this ""Firing Line"" episode during college, I wanted to re-visit this encounter expecting numerous ""intellectuals,"" (Chomsky alone,sorry) this remains still an entertaining engagement(though no re-peat invitation offered ) between the public spokesman/advocate/publisher of the conservative movement in the US, William F. Buckley, Jr. (host) versus the erudite, brilliant, unflappable MIT professor,Noam Chomsky, solitary representative of the liberal left. Within a half hour of this wrestling match of gifted minds, sparring over interpretations of the motivations behind our involvement with the Vietnam War, Mr. Buckley displays only mild frustration (with one feigned threat of fist) while in the company of Chomsky, a titanic steely academic mind unbending with quiet command of fact or prolific output. Buckley, over the course of 50 minutes of this elevated discussion, appears to silently acknowledge the taller mountain of fact and moral conscience of Chomsky so much that he abandons his normal tact when facing populist heroes of that era,(to attack and charmingly parry for awhile)retreating to take questions from future columnists like Jeff Greenfield, who divert the audience from the abandoned, expected ""liberal"" bash. In a Youtube clip, Noam Chomsky looks back to this episode with no special significance, finding Mr. Buckley impressionless or unworthy of his public image. I would say that Noam Chomsky to his credit presents himself as a disarming antagonist, cool like an iceberg in the face of expected oncoming communist-baiting heat that never comes. Which probably explains why we never see the likes of this quality of discourse on the news. Instead of sitting quietly still in the face of vaporous news fiction, we certainly need a mountain of moral conscience to roll it off into the waste can with Chomsky informed coolness.",1344470400,11,1868,5.557894736842106
4131065,5,B003JMFB8W,"My thread title is in reference to the forgotten art of earnest, intellectual, vitriol free discussion,  where-in you always walk away rubbing your chin, not fulminating at the cheap shots or vapid rhetoric which is all that's available today it appears.  Susskind, Cabot, Buckley they are gone and are not coming back sadly.

Firing Line cds/dvds were here to fore available through a laborious ordering system at Stanford, the Hoover institute, I am very happy to see them here, there are many others not yet transcribed, and can be found at Hoover as well.

I won't remark on the segment itself, except to say it is very illuminating in that it sketches one of the chasms' neatly the pathos ala conservatism and neo liberalism/progressivism. Enjoy.",1314662400,8,751,4.984
4131066,5,B003JMFB8W,"Chomsky is erudite, articulate, and unflappable, but Buckley transcends. It is intellectual dialogue unseen on TV today and well worth watching. My 25 year old son was fascinated, people his age now see little of this kind of debate/interview. Interviewers on the major networks today lack the brainpower to even attempt to really explore ideas, and pro and con panel debates degenerate into shouted sound bites, with no one able to moderate the discussion.",1280188800,17,457,5.1891891891891895

8398301,5,B003JMFB8W,"One of the best Firing Line episodes. Two intellectuals of more or less equal brilliance debating their two different foreign policy views. Is the U.S. a bully to the world or acting reasonably in pushing Democracy around the world. It is refreshing to see two men with such extreme differences go at it in a very civilized, intelligent way. Both have extreme knowledge of history and foreign affairs and so were discussing issues in an informed, intelligent, reasoned way.",1425254400,,473,5.0

8398304,5,B003JMFB8W,"Engrossing. By illustrating the faults of the Truman Doctrine, and the folly of American interventionism, Chomsky shows us just how much of a box the right was in during the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Instead of embracing a Burkean conservatism, and calling for the end of foreign wars, the right in America instead, took up the mantle of furthering the foreign policies of what then was the American left, and then actually extending them to a kind of absurdity. This paradoxical position, was one that Buckley would argue from till the bitter end, and it still resonates today in the neo-conservative movement. Although I believe Chomsky to be a somewhat failed utopian, with his ideas of anarcho-syndicalism, he is probably the worlds foremost intellectual, and whether or not you agree with all his positions, his brilliance is inarguable. The most important thing that this debate illustrates though, is the bankruptcy of the American Right and Left. I miss Bill Buckley. His show allowed for a type of high minded intellectual perspective that is nowhere to be found in modern television, or more broadly modern political debate....",1381708800,3,1133,5.096774193548387

8398306,5,B003JMFB8W,"What a wonderful piece of cultural history this video is.  It is entertaining on one level because William F. Buckley and Noam Chomsky are such fascinating debaters.  But it is also fascinating because it shows what liberals were saying at the time.  In an age were liberals claimed to have always opposed Communism and that we all won the Cold War ""together"" this is a useful reminder that when the Cold War was being waged the liberals were not good allies in the fight.  Almost every claim that Chomsky makes in the debate is put to lie but later events.  Everything that Chomsky advocates in the debate from the nature of the Viet Cong to his desire for domestic sabotage to derail the war effort has proven to be complete bunk.

Chomsky in this video is obviously a brilliant fellow but he is wrong about nearly everything he asserts.  If he can bring his great intellect and wide reading to an issue about Vietnam and yet be wrong about everything he advocates we in turn would do well to also cast a jaundiced eye over the intellectuals today. This video reminds us that Intellectuals like everyone else can get it wrong, very wrong.",1370908800,5,1140,4.586206896551724
8398307,5,B003JMFB8W,"This is an interesting discussion which features Chomsky first comparing America's actions to the Nazi's formation of concentration camps under the umbrella that neither are debatable in terms of their lack of morality. He follows this by denying he is drawing a comparison between US policy and the policy of Nazi Germany.

Chomsky's credibility finally falls flat on its face when he denies the documented mass murder of millions in China during the formation of their communist government and to make the argument even worse for him, he claims that these communist governments are democratic in nature. This rationalization of his still boggles my mind even though it shouldn't because he did the same thing later with Poi Pot and the reports of the genocide which was occurring in Cambodia. When these facts became undeniable for Chomsky, he simply labeled the West as the culprit. I am wondering how anyone can be labelled an intellectual when they believe that democracy exists in communistic states. Do they think there is 100% unanimity behind those walls designed to keep the people in?? Incredible.

He also fails to acknowledge the role the Japanese government played which made the dropping of the A bombs in Japan necessary. The US not only warned the Japanese imperial gov't prior to the dropping of the first bomb that it would be dropped if they failed to surrender, the US ended up having to do it a second time as well. It was only after the US bluffed to drop a third nonexistent bomb that caused the Japanese government to surrender. Even thoughthe Japanese government made these bombings inevitable, Chomsky still labels the acts as war crimes against the US.

For much of this discussion (and many Firing Line debates), Buckley allows the guest to speak long enough to make these points come to light for the viewer and either you believe the US and the West are the cause of all the ills in the world and that Communist Governments are filled with Democracy and goodness or you judge on the side of reality.",1364601600,7,2030,4.844380403458214
