Tried it on multiple players, but still no luck. Too late for a refund as I've had it for a little while and just discovered it did not work.",1392422400,,276,4.226415094339623

3972400,5,B002RB56XG,"Martin Luther King, Jr. Had a dream. I wonder if it has been fulfilled. His four little children have grown into adults (R.I.P. Yolanda) and they have lived up to his example. But as a nation we are still being judged by the color of our skin, not the content of our character. We are judged by our sex, sexual orientation, economical status, educational status, the place where we were born, the list is endless. The blessing for me is that I have lived to see the first truly African-American President,",1381190400,,505,4.56043956043956

3972402,5,B002RB56XG,"All four stories are read by professionals with good background music and video work. The two author interviews were very good. Just keep in mind that the interviews were filmed in 2008 just before President Obama's first inauguration (they mention he is about to become the first African American President). It dates it, but still a very good video.",1361232000,,351,4.966101694915254
3972403,1,B002RB56XG,"Tried 2 different DVDs, both had the same problem - picture freeze, close caption would turn on and off by itself, the main menu would not work.  Wasn't Amazon's fault, the DVD was not right.  Amazon did a great job of making the returns easy.  Will try a different title.",1269561600,,272,4.4
3972404,5,B002RB56XG,"Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Henry Box Brown -- these are names that bring tears to our eyes, make our hearts swell in appreciation for courageous sacrifice, and make us incredibly grateful for the freedom we've been blessed with here in North America. March On! The Day My Brother Martin Changed the World is a new release in the Scholastic Storybook Treasures collection which presents beloved modern classic picture books in DVD adaptations complete with narration.

Four picture book adaptations are included on the DVD with 15 awards between them. March On! is written by King's sister, Christine King Farris, and focuses tightly upon King's unforgettable ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Martin's Big Words places the passionate defender of equal rights in the larger setting of the civil rights movement and draws more of his childhood upbringing into his adult character. Rosa shares the story of Rosa Parks, the bus incident, and the ensuing protests in a warmly personal way that children can relate to. Henry's Freedom Box is the tremendously sad, and equally jubilant story of Henry Box Brown and his unusual escape to freedom.

Overall the Christian background of many influential figures in the civil rights movement is prominently mentioned throughout the DVD. I truly appreciated this accurate depiction of the faith and motivation for these individuals, free from secular re-writing. The shorts are also often accompanied by moving gospel singing in the background as appropriate.

Unlike some of the other installments in the Scholastic Storybook Treasures read-along DVD series, March On! consists of modern storybook adaptations, all hailing from within the last decade. Like the other DVDs in the collection, March On! includes optional English read-along subtitles which are highlighted as each word is read by the narrator.

The shorts are uniformly composed of panning across, zooming in on, layering, and moving the original illustrations work with no animation (some minor exceptions). The title short March On! also includes black and white photographs from the civil rights protests of 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech preparations and presentations, just as Rosashares archival photographs.

Running approximately 69 minutes in length, the DVD also features two wonderful extra features, interviews with Martin Luther King Jr.'s sister, the author of March On! and Ellen Levine, the author of Henry's Freedom Box.

Selling for approximately $15.00, March On! The Day My Brother Martin Changed the World is an affordable choice for parents and educators. An excellent range of high-quality picture books dealing with the quest for equal rights for people of all colors is provided for the cost of a single picture book, and the production quality is excellent. This DVD can easily be used for supplemental teaching or introductions to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month.

It is easy for our young children to take the lack of segregation and abundance of freedom in our society for granted. I doubt any of us can argue that we've fully arrived, but still, my young children have had a difficult time wrapping their heads around concepts such as slavery, segregation, and racial discrimination. Forays into a history not long past can ensure that we don't forget the legacy begun by the works of courage of African Americans such as those we meet on this DVD.",1264204800,11,3409,5.20985401459854

8378589,4,B002RB56XG,"I bought this to use in my kindergarten classroom. I have a ton of the Scholastic videos and love them all in their own way. This is a great addition to a classroom library. My only issue is that one of the videos is extremely long, way too long for kindergarten. I did love having Henry's Freedom Box and Martin's Big Words to watch after I have read the books.",1392854400,,362,4.185714285714286
