4594463,5,B00579EJYW,"You have to love modern opera to appreciate this one. Migenes is super.
She sang before Lulu, the role of Bizet's Carmen and that performance would have made Callas very envious!",1357344000,,178,4.774193548387097
4594464,4,B00579EJYW,"This version is a good value for the money.  It features the amazing Julia Migenes early in her career, and she shines in this incredibly difficult role.  I have long admired the gutsy way she tackles the big roles (such as Carmen in the Da Rosa movie of 1984).
  James Levine is in top form with the orchestra and I really liked the video work in filming the orchestra.
  The biggest minus, I think, is the video quality, which seems grainy and faded with age in color .  This takes away from the quality of the costumes and the set design.  Sound quality was good, though I've heard better in later digital DVDs of this work.",1324684800,10,627,4.344827586206897
4594465,5,B00579EJYW,"I have been waiting for a commercial release of this broadcast for over thirty years.  During that time I've had to satisfy myself with my old VHS copy and subsequent DVD transfer.

This is one of the greatest telecasts in MET history.  Everybody is excellent.  Some of you may not know that Stratas cancelled that afternoon and the three-month pregnant Migenes and her husband just came back home from Christmas shopping when she got word.  They rushed to the MET and made it just in time for the curtain.  This was revealed in a SIXTY MINUTES interview.

Get this DVD before it disappears.",1321574400,9,591,4.679611650485437

IT CAPTURES THE MEMORABLE PERFORMANCES OF JULIA MIGENES, EVELYN LEAR, KENNETH RIEGEL AND FRANK MAZURA, UNDER MAESTRO JAMES LEVINE.  FOR THE MOMENT, THE BEST LULU AROUND.",1320451200,5,354,4.786885245901639
4594467,5,B00579EJYW,"Lulu (The Metropolitan Opera  DVD)
Having just returned from seeing the Met Opera's May 15, 2010 production of Berg's Lulu, I must say the 1977 sets of John Dexter hold up well... What a cast I saw that afternoon... returning home and playing this DVD, it was as if this was just an alternate cast of what I saw that afternoon in 2010. It mirrored what's on this DVD... the standouts here are the Lulu of Julia Mingenes; all the notes, her use of body language, and her eyes. Dr Schon/Jack the Ripper of Franz Mazur; what a voice, outstanding. Alwa of Kenneth Riegel, no milk-toast, but riveting as the dog following Lulu to his end. Countess Geschwitz; Evelyn Lear, outstanding in every way. The rest of the cast, outstanding as well. What's even better, all of Berg's instructions were followed... right down to the minute detail. IE: During Dr. Schon's manic faze in Act 2 before he's shot by Lulu, he's waving the gun around, he sees Lulu's pursuers around every corner. Berg coded those movements in the score, and they pop up as as they dart around the room.

I was so pleased to have seen the Met's live 2010 Lulu, back-to-back, with this DVD. That says how good the this DVD is...",1316563200,29,1188,4.52093023255814
4594468,5,B00579EJYW,"We saw this production last year at the Met, and thought that the performance was outstanding.

When I saw the DVD on Amazon, I assumed that it was the same performance. I was wrong.

This is, indeed, the same production, but the performance took place over thirty years ago, with a different cast, and James Levine at the helm. The only production difference that I could see (apart from the cast and conductor) was the slide show during the cinematic center of the opera. This was omitted from the 2010 version.

It's superb. A very young James Levine is positively bursting with enthusiasm, coaxing every ounce of melody out of Berg's potentially opaque score. It's clear from his expression that he's loving every minute of it.

The singers were outstanding - worthy of note were Julia Migenes, in the title role, portraying Lulu as a mixture of predator and victim; there's something about her portrayal which reminds me of Salome. Evelyn Lear brought a lovely mezzo voice to the tragic figure of Countess Geschwitz, and Franz Mazura as Doctor Schn/Jack the Ripper had immense stage presence.

For some reason, there seem to be some very expensive versions of this DVD out there. I'm not sure why, but this one was about the normal price for an opera.

Go on, buy it. You know you want to.",1314835200,20,1294,4.70353982300885
8460394,5,B00579EJYW,"We have had to wait thirty years for the Metropolitan Opera's 1980 telecast of Lulu to be made available to the public, and it proves worthy of the greatest anticipation. It had only been in 1979 that the completed three-act version of the twelve-tone masterpiece was premiered, in Paris, with Teresa Stratas in Patrice Chreau's production, conducted by the great Pierre Boulez.

John Dexter saw that production, but went his own way at the Met. This is indeed one of his great productions, naturalistic but intimately tied to the music. The level of detail and insight into this difficult work is astonishing. Of Dexter's operatic productions available on DVD (Rigoletto, Don Carlos, etc), this is certainly one of the finest examples of his genius. The quality of the performance (both musical and visual) seems like they had been rehearsing the work for years rather than weeks.

At the time of the telecast, one registered disappointment, since Stratas was to have been the anti-heroine. Today, we can better evaluate Julia Migenes's performance, and it is of stellar quality. Without the demonic, serpentine quality of Anja Silja, or the death-haunted version of Stratas, she is perhaps the most sensuous of all, both in voice and approach.

And what an opera: It traces the utter degradation of an mesmerizing sociopath, along with everyone in her circle, through to her death at the hands of ""Jack the Ripper,"" no less. The music is very complex, to overwhelming effect.

We can see that James Levine clearly loves the score, and almost the entire cast could hardly be improved: Evelyn Lear (still a great beauty at the age of fifty-four, as the Countess Geschwitz), Kenneth Riegel, Frank Little, Franz Mazura, Lenus Carlson, Andrew Foldi, Hilda Harris, Nico Castel, Ara Berberian, Betsy Norden, Batyah Godfrey, Nedda Casei, and John Darrenkamp. It is amazing to have artists of this caliber in even the secondary roles.  [As William R. Braun wrote in 2011, ""It is likely that this 1980 Lulu will stand for all time as the high-water mark of Met telecasts.""]
Lulu, and especially this production of it, is a towering achievement, a terrible cry of humanity.  [May 20, 2010]",1516924800,6,2180,5.00828729281768
8460395,5,B00579EJYW,"I saw this performance in person at the Met and this dvd redoubled my great admiration for the opera, the score and the conducting.  The greatest opera of the 20th century in a nearly perfect rendition.  It's true that this package is not as appealing as the many DGG Met issues; it's basically a tape of the pbs presentation; but that is a minor concern compared to all the bad alternatives out there, most recently one with the Barcelona Opera with The Ripper somehow ending up as Santa Claus  ...  no kidding!",1497398400,,512,4.532608695652174
8460396,3,B00579EJYW,I purchased this DVD out of curiosity without expecting to enjoy anything composed in the 12 tone scale.,1483228800,,104,4.833333333333333
8460397,1,B00579EJYW,"This is a difficult operas to perform, as well as a difficult one to watch, even when its performed correctly and in accordance with the directives of its composer, Alban Berg. Its the story of a hard, calculating, somewhat unbalanced woman, who, almost constantly, moves or plans to move, from one lover or spouse, to another lover or spouse. All of those lovers or spouses seem to be at least one brick short of having his or her hod full.

 The opera was written to take place in the late 19th century but this performance (and I use that term VERY loosely, in this review), seems to have moved the venue into the early 20th century, which, in theory, should not significantly affect the details.

 Im not sure where to start, with whats wrong with this performance. Act one starts with a circus barker, introducing Lulu, as a snake, atop the shoulders of a circus performer. Nonsensical? Absolutely, unless you want to start with the idea that the whole of this presentation is supposed to be nothing more than a circus! The performance goes downhill, from there. Between the acts, we are forced to spend time in the orchestra pit, watching Levine conduct and several members of the orchestra play their instruments. That is unacceptable. We do not buy a DVD of any opera, to spend time watching the orchestra perform. Opera music should be heard, as background, not seen.

 In addition to that, the loudness of the orchestra, intermittently, drowns much of the so-called singing. Julia Migenes, as Lulu, screeches or screams many of her vocals. There isn't a quality voice in as much of this presentation as I was able to watch. I turned it off, about two-thirds of the way into the 2nd act. It was just that bad. I cannot rate any voice, in this presentation, above a C- grade.
 Dont waste your time or money.",1461542400,,1815,4.653125
8460398,4,B00579EJYW,"To make this review easy: I think that the back of the DVD box of this nearly 40 year old  vintage production says it all, if diplomatically:

""Alban Berg's Lulu has finally made it to the Metropolitan Opera declared The New York Times when this production premiered in 1977. [And filmed in 1980]. This Lulu is an experience that all adventurous music lovers will want to sample. Met Music Director James Levine long a champion of this ground breaking work, was the driving artistic force behind Lulu's highly anticipated Met premiere.

The opera is real interesting musically,but,it's the acting and the visual that really get's you involved in this opera. Performances are great. If you do as I did where I just wanted to learn this work this would be the dvd to get.
