8057183,4,B00094HUYG,"The stories behind great literature are usually fascinating.  This is pretty interesting.  But if you don't like sad topics like being lost, death, and cannibalism, then this is not for you.  Yes, this documentary speaks of human triumph, but it has heaps of human tragedy as well.  If you liked ""The Endurance"" narrated by Liam Neeson or Tom Hanks' film where he's stranded on a desert island, then this work is for you.  History buffs may also really appreciate this work.  I guess those that liked ""Perfect Storm"" would too.  Be prepared to learn the truth but have to witness a terribly sad subject matter.",1136937600,5,610,4.752380952380952
