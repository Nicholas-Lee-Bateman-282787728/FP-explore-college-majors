8707991,5,B00US8DO1Q,These are great videos.  They are much better than the old Dora cartoons and the animation and musical songs are great!  These adventures teach Spanish language and good life skills along with cute stories of Dora and her friends.  These are great new movies and my 2yr old loves them!  They keep her attention and she answers along... it's great~!,1447632000,,348,4.75
