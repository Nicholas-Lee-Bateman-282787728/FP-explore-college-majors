6481825,5,B00LF5GD64,"Though most of my reviews on Amazon are of entertainment items, in my ""other life"", I'm a CPA and tax accountant ant with over 40 years experience, so I feel I can more than adequately review this DVD.

The core of the DVD package is a program that aired on local PBS stations near the end of 2014 during pledge-break time.  The program was chopped into four pieces with LONG pledge breaks inserted so that the 70 minute show took 90 minutes to watch. During those breaks the stations offered the DVD as a pledge gift, and announced that there would extra material on the DVD. Well there is, and I'll get to that in a minute.

Orman is a commentator on MSNBC or one of the cable networks that I don't get. But she's also a ""motivational speaker"" and can really hold an audiences attention. For this show, she is tanding on a stage in Washington DC with a screen behind her showing the title of her talk. But, nowhere during the hour-plus are any graphics shown. You see Orman on stage and see the audience, who are there to learn and ask her questions. There is probably an ""applause"" sign somewhere as everyone applauds at the same time. And the evening was certainly edited to pick the most ""interesting"" questions.

I may sound a bit negative in my comments above but I can honestly recommend this DVD anyone out there with debt - whether it be credit card debt, a high mortgage or, most importantly, a student loan. You WILL learn something from this show and Orman speaks in simple plain terms. Whether you follow through on her advice will determine how valuable this show is.

The DVD adds four segments that weren't aired (totally about 17 minutes) covering topics like Long Term Care insurance, Investing in Gold, and selling a residence that is pulling you into debt.

If you are money-savvy there will be nothing new for you here. But if you want some simple advice, which will take less time to read than a book, this might be for you.

As a bonus, remember that, if you itemize your tax deductions, the cost of the DVD may be deductible as an ""investment periodical"".

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
