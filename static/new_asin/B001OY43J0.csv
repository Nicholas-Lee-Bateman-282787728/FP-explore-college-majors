3736991,1,B001OY43J0,How is this $15? Wow. Just wow. I wonder if these guys have deluded themselves into thinking they're going to be legitimately famous in the future. Sadness.,1235520000,4,156,4.814814814814815

8331752,2,B001OY43J0,It's a crappy B movie. Not much else to it. Not even funny. Don't buy it. Unless you are a major NigaHiga fan.,1390176000,,110,3.8260869565217392

8331756,5,B001OY43J0,"This movie is even funnier if you are a nigahiga fan.  Just seeing him in this movie is funny.  Although they do not act like themselves, I don't think it matters because the whole movie is just for the comedy and it has no point either.  ITS JUST PLAIN FUNNY!! I crack up in laughter every time I watch it!  It's a pointless comedy and for that, I love it.",1285113600,10,357,4.057142857142857
8331757,1,B001OY43J0,"I truly love nigahiga but if they weren't really playing themselves in this movie, i have no idea what to say to the producer. It is not worth to buy this dvd. Do not waste your time cause i apparently did. You could watch them for free on youtube. Dont even bother. There was no plot, no storyline, and no humor. The worst movie ever seen.",1249689600,6,340,4.166666666666667
8331758,5,B001OY43J0,"Ryan Higa and Sean Fujiyoshi are best known on YouTube for HOW TO BE NINJA, HOW TO BE GANGSTER, HOW TO BE EMO, HOW TO BE NERD, HOW TO BE UFC FIGHTER, their characters; Helga Fawntanilla & The Stalking Mangina and their MOVIES IN MINUTES.

but still it was a bite cheesy and a little lame
i was disappointed i thought it would be funnier
but still its a good movie with some hilarious parts",1238284800,3,195,3.9
8331760,5,B001OY43J0,"So everyone at school thought i was crazy saying that ""Ryan and Sean DID make a movie! I remember watching it at my uncles house"". I was looking at my moms old orders on her amazon and saw this. I NEW IT. I WAS RIGHT. Now I just have to find it... or just watch it online.",1237680000,,272,3.789473684210526
