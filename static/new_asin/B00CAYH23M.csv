5710003,5,B00CAYH23M,"A good family movie that everyone can enjoy. This movie is funny, a little predictable, but worth watching for sure.",1375747200,2,116,4.85
5710004,5,B00CAYH23M,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). The Sweeter Side of Life was really quite clean. I think it had only two swear words.  The only violence is a woman kicks a man when exercising, a woman attacks husband by pulling his tie, after she finds he has been having an affair; a woman gets hit by taxi, a man punches another.  There are several scenes where people are drinking and there is cleavage.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for all ages.

Desiree is the wife of a plastic surgeon, who lives in Manhattan.  She loves her life until she finds her husband has been having an affair. Because she freaked out when she told him and also signed a prenuptial agreement, she has to surrender her ring, her keys to her ""former dwelling"" and her attorney/high school friend has to negotiate  the retrieval of her belongings in the presence of a police officer.  Since her friends turn her back on her she goes home to good old Flemington New Jersey where her father still runs the family bakery.  She discovers  that the things she thought were important, don't really matter any more.  She helps her father turn his failing business around and meets and falls for a local French restaurant owner and hotel manager, who happens to live in probably the only mansion in New Jersey.  She realizes that life really is sweeter on the other side of the river.

She is a little annoying during the beginning of the move as she has to adjust to her ""new"" life, but by the end is really enjoyable.  Overall, I really liked this move and will definitely watch it again.",1375142400,,1810,4.43202416918429
5710005,3,B00CAYH23M,"With this movie you get the typical, clean-cut family-type movie that Hallmark has become famous for. This particular one follows a fairly tried and true formula for romantic comedies. In this case, a woman who is used to fancy living and luxurious shopping is forced to move back home after her rich surgeon husband announces that he has been cheating on her. The ironclad prenuptual agreement she signed means she is penniless and has to rely on her older father who owns a bakery in New Jersey. Along the way, she helps to rejuvenate the bakery and she meets a nice guy who owns a fancy restaurant in the country. The main character is somewhat unlikable at the start of the movie, but becomes a bit softer as things go along. Most of the other characters seem pleasant. The main issue with the film is that there isn't anything terribly original and there isn't a whole lot of relationship development between the main character and the nice guy she meets. It really ends up being more of a movie about going back home than a romantic comedy. If you like clean, low-key TV movies, this one might be worth checking out. If you are looking for something really fresh, this one probably won't be it.",1374883200,3,1200,4.586046511627907

5710169,4,B00CAYH23M,"I guess you've got it good when you're the pampered housewife of a famous Manhattan plastic surgeon. I am referring to Desiree Harper (Kathryn Morris) whose husband is the ""cosmetic foot doctor to the stars."" (He specializes in ""toe-besity."") The good doctor is fully paid up on his jerkface dues. Keep that in mind because, one day after their wedding anniversary, he dumps his wife for his 20-year-old acupuncturist. So here's Desiree, post-heave ho, penniless and stripped of her posh digs and not even allowed to keep her wedding ring (it's all in the pre-nup). Plus, her ex just put a restraining order on her.

With her upper crust friends suddenly all judgy and deserting her, Desiree flees back home to Flemington, New Jersey, to her widowed pops (James Best) who dwells on top of the family bakery. Fifth Avenue has never been so out of reach, and yet I love that Desiree's old room has still got that Rick Springfield poster on the wall and that her alarm clock is a Rubik's Cube.

How's Desiree at reassessing? Can she adjust her priorities, adapt to a more mundane, lower tax bracket lifestyle? Can she learn to appreciate what really matters in life: family, friendship, pride in one's work? Or, as I like to call it, things that poor people have? Once upon a time she'd earned an MBA from Columbia, so can she work something up to revitalize her dad's failing bakery? But, man, she needs to stop giving the world a news flash each time she breaks a nail. Get it together, Desiree.

I rate it a better-than-average 3.5 out of 5 stars. THE SWEETER SIDE OF LIFE is a cute Hallmark Channel original movie that first aired on late January, 2013. And I guess the Hallmark executives have deemed it not at all cliched that the lead female role is initially portrayed as this shallow, squealing mess. It's a bit jarring to see Kathryn Morris squealing and otherwise going the ditzy route, acclimated as I was to her days as tough-as-nails Detective Lilly Rush from COLD CASE. The movie loses points for its insipid take on women as useless trophy wives, but I guess it does make Desiree's gradual evolution to down-to-earth Jersey girl that much more telling and dramatic.

I say watch it. There are some good gags, some funny bits. Kathryn Morris engages the viewers enough that she soon wins them over, never mind her character's early spoiled act. And there's something mesmerizing in watching an actress once associated with a brooding role try her hand at fluffy comedy. Alastair Mackenzie plays the lightweight romantic interest, this chef what owns an imposing chateau in the middle of Jersey. I like him best for executing a series of comic falls. Still, the funniest moment concerns Kathryn Morris' wardrobe malfunction. Prepping for a meeting with her ex and his lawyers, she wants to look nice. Except that her dad had thrown her expensive brand name clothes in the washer and drier and now they're shrunk all to hell. I grinned pretty huge when the camera cut to the ensuing scene and we see her entering the law offices dressed in garish retro 1980s attire. And then, next thing you know, someone in the scene is quoting my movie review title.",1375833600,5,3162,4.7228260869565215

Not one bit of chemistry between Morris and her husband OR the new love interest.

8579383,1,B00CAYH23M,"Very sad that Hallmark, a ""family movie"" company has allowed female actresses to wear very low cut necklines and reveal way too much skin.  The show had a good theme in family importance with the actress's dad, but the divorce premises were throughout the movie.  The so-to-be ex husband is an adulterer and a rich snob that has through a pre-nup agreement left his faithful, but proud wife penniless.  She has to learn to be humble and go back to her dad's bakery.  Eventually she finds love within the neighbor of her dad's small bakery.",1517529600,,539,4.6421052631578945
