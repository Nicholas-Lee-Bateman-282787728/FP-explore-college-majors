5276930,5,B0097RU2LO,Why in the world would anyone think this is about a French Queen. This sure looks like one very funny movie. American wretched excess displayed on your screen. It does not get any better than this.,1343952000,4,197,4.5

5276932,5,B0097RU2LO,"Congratulations to filmmaker Lauren Greenfield. She clearly got this mini-Trump con man, David Siegel, on film because his sociopathic ego wanted to celebrate the construction of his gauche McMansion in Orlando, of all places.

And then the 2008 financial crisis hit, and Greenfield just kept filming.

Realize that the subject of the film, slime-bag Siegel, sued the director for defamation -- and lost.

Just like Siegel lost a sexual harassment suit in 2008.

But what would you expect of a bottom-feeder like this college drop-out.

He is in the time-share business, so-called. He doesn't sell you a deed to a property; He basically collects five figures or even six figures in advance for what, in essence, is a hotel reservation. Time shares are the biggest scam, and he knows it.

Listen to how derogatory Siegel and his side-kick son are in describing their target customers -- ""moochers,"" Joe lunch-buckets who only earn 40 or 50 K a year.

So I felt zero sympathy for Siegel and his Frankenstein of a family. Don't relate to them, don't identify with them. I cringe as I watch their narcissistic solipsisms, and I *want* them to fail. They deserve to fail.

Karma is a bitch, and Lauren Greenfield is a superstar documentarian.",1482105600,11,1237,4.913461538461538

5276949,4,B0097RU2LO,"This documentary is hypnotizing and you just can't look away.

One cannot watch without thinking this was a human example/experiment of trapping a monkey, i.e.: A box with cherished monkey fruit inside. There is but one hole, which is only big enough to withdraw the monkey's hand. When the monkey grabs the food in the box, the circumference of both hand and food becomes too large to remove via the one hole. If the monkey doesn't let go of the fruit in the box to save it's life, it's caught.

Greed/ego will trap both the monkey and the human. This is a prime example of apparent child-like egos and bad business decisions. It appears there was never a clear thought of living a meaningful life beyond acquiring objects or achieving some perceived ego status. I actually pity them, as they acquired so much, tried to hold on to what doesn't matter and have bankrupted souls in the process.",1470700800,5,893,4.6455696202531644

5276957,4,B0097RU2LO,"The tale begins with a trophy wife and her much older, very rich husband. They congratulate themselves on their ridiculous spending and lifestyle, and then the bottom falls out. The sub-prime mortgage bust takes out the little people on whom their time share scheme relies, and ironically, the Siegel's go down with the ship. Their home, which was maintained by an army of caregivers, gives way to a feces riddled nightmare. Instead of the family coming together to buckle down and become better, more enlightened versions of themselves they implode and become cautionary tales of what happens when you believe your money will always save you. Their slovenly children do not feed their pets so they die imprisoned in their cages with nary a care from their owners on the suffering they endured by starving/thirsting to death. The Queen continues to spend, spend, spend. The thing that was most perplexing is that she did not come from money, but had completely lost the ability to see why leaving on all of the lights when money was tight was a bad thing. If she wanted the job of trophy wife then she should understand why her husband was upset to come home to that disgusting house rampant with dogs and kids everywhere.  I could go on all day so I will wrap up with the thing the movie drove home to me. The banks loaned the money to all of those people that eventually defaulted on their sub-prime mortgages. People by the millions lost their homes, jobs, and retirement funds. Investors like Mr. Siegel lost their gravy train.  When the government agreed to the bailouts, only the banks got bailed out. They were allowed to recall their loans and increase their holdings. Our economy is depressed to this day, but the banks made out like bandits in the night. This makes my blood boil and I just cannot fathom why this was allowed to happen.",1469836800,3,1846,4.694444444444445

5276967,5,B0097RU2LO,"What I saw was chaos, people out of control when they were rich and when they were poor.  There were no rules, no constraints and I'm talkiing about everything.  No constraints on spending money, no rules for acceptable household behavior for the children, no potty training their dogs (the scenes of all the dog poop on the floor was disgusting).  Although the individuals seemed like nice enough people (they weren't mean or evil and seemed to be able to love, at east the wife), they were so totally self indugent.  She always wanted a bowling alley so they were going to put one in, he wanted this in the house, she wanted that.... no constraints, out of control spending without a thought but for the next humongous thing they couldn't live without.  How many painting were there of themselves?  Outside of being totally narcissistic, what's the point of having so many?

And of course, there is the total idiocy of wanting a 90,000 sf house in light of all the poverty in the world.  And why have it?  David said, because he could.  That's not a house, that's not a home, no one can actually live in 90,000 sf or even half that.  That's solely to show the world how much money you have.

The wife was a somewhat sympathetic character, at least she didn't bemoan their new lack of money and seemed to take it in stride (although she was incapable of really cutting down).  She seemed to really care for her husband, but then she was soooo superficial also.  Not only did she have her boobs enlarged to balloon size, but she showed them off at inappropriate times.  And then there was her life long friend who was going to lose her house and she sent her $5,000 (but she lost it anyway).  $5,000?  She has spent more for shoes or a purse.  Why didn't she send her more money?  It's her best friend! Incomprehensible, unless she is not empathetic to the needs of others.)

Anyway, despite not understanding the lifestyle of the Siegels, the film was done expertly and deserves the 5 stars I gave it.  I was enraptured thoroughly.",1469318400,5,2032,4.542699724517906

5276972,4,B0097RU2LO,"I recently saw Jackie Siegel featured in some media articles and her husbands business indirectly affected the life of my husband and I (more on that later). As a result, I was curious to check out the Queen of Versailles documentary. The positives: David Siegel and Jackie Siegel are forthright and honest about how things have changed for them at the beginning of filming compared to at the end. For instance, Jackie Siegel takes a viewer andor viewers through one of the thrift marts that she owns and how she now views money through how she is seen shopping at places such as McDonalds and Walmart.  Additionally, Jackie Siegel shares how her upbringing influenced how she goes about her life during the documentary. The kids are also featured including her late daughter Victoria Siegel.  Jackie Siegels husband David Siegel (mentioned to be CEO of Westgate Resorts) candidly shares how his path crossed with Jackie Siegel preceding when they got married. One of his sons that works in the business is also featured. Additionally, one of the family nannies Virginia Nebab expresses her gratitude of working with the family but also admits at the time of the filming it had been a long time since she had seen her own kids in the Philippines. I was actually surprised to have enjoyed watching the documentary much more than I initially expected. The cons; The viewer is at least shown at least somewhat of a glimpse in how the Westgate timeshares are sold to customers during their vacations. Additionally, David Siegel, Jackie Siegel, and David Siegels son do show some remorse at the employees of Westgate Resorts that were laid off during the filming. However, one of the caveats left out of the film is that a Westgate Timeshare is hard to sell off andor give back once a person andor people agree to buying it (a timeshare is not like a car where a person could at least give it back to Carmax if they need to sell it back for money).  Additionally, a person cannot change their mind about giving back the timeshare even if it has been a short timeframe after they realized that the investment is not for them. Im ready for whatever judgment is publicly thrown at me for sharing this but the fact that a customer is discouraged  from being able to think it over on purchasing the timeshare for at least 24 hours from the time that the Westgate employee/salesperson pushes the timeshare is a warning sign. How Do I Know This? I shamelessly admit that back in June 2007 my husband and I allowed ourselves to be persuaded into buying a Westgate Timeshare in Orlando Florida without even allowing ourselves to think it over for at least 24 hours and secondguessing my intuition when the salesperson insisted on my husband and I purchasing the timeshare right on the spot (which is why I aim to listen to my intuition more often today regardless of how Im judged). My husband paid money towards the bank affiliated with Westgate Resort for at least a year which did nothing to reduce the balance (we found out later that the bank affiliated with those payments went under investigation). Additionally, I later found out  via the Dave Ramsey website the truth about owning a timeshare but it was too late for my husband and I to give back the timeshare by the time I came across the website article pertaining to the truth about timeshares.  My point that I wish that I would have known beforehand; Try to think it through for at least 24-48 hours before purchasing a Westgate Timeshare through research online and other sources and ignore any pushy Westgate salespeople who try to strong arm you in buying the timeshare on the spot. I could look back at that money lesson situation with a sense of calmness because the money lesson picked up in the aftermath affects just my husband and I household income wise(my husband and I are completely child-free but we have nothing against parents or children).  Other than my Westgate Resort tale I would have been embarrassed to tell 2-3 years ago but Im ok with now shamelessly admitting it, the Queen of Versailles documentary is watchable.",1468886400,5,4090,4.727910238429173

It is a story of incredible wealth, and it is disturbing at times what they do with it. But it is not all fun and games for this family. The film follows them over a number of years and during this time they go through transformations, transitions and much more. It is a great film to watch just to see how the other half lives, or at least how this 1% chooses to live. I found mysel appalled by their choices and attitudes at times during the film, but before I knew it I would flip and find myself empathizing with them as well. The children are a product of their environment and it will be interesting to see what kind of adults they turn out to be as a product of this unique lifestyle.

These people have no class at all, they were (and most likely still are) very greedy people, incapable of raising their kids on their own, incapable of getting their dogs house-broken (if they were that rich why didn't they hire a person to get the dogs house-broken...our dog was house broken within 3 weeks, all it takes is perseverance and a few nights of interrupted sleep to get the dog out every 4 hours...no big deal) and on top of it all they are the most pompous people (especially the wife) that I could imagine.
And in the end they got what was coming to them. So there's some justice after all :).

What a waste of my precious spare time to watch this garbage. After half an hour I just had to stop, put in another DVD and watched something much more enjoyable and interesting. How this documentary could get 359 reviews (and most of them positive reviews??????) is just beyond me.
What's happening to our society if we keep accepting and even enjoy watching such trash?

The only reason why I watched this was the fact that Versailles was in the title. I've been multiple times to the real Versailles near Paris. Their house did not resemble Versailles the least. It was their wishful thinking that made it look to them like Versailles. Did they ever walk through the palais de Versailles or the heavenly parc de Versailles? I doubt it.

Would you provide food for the needy? How about helping save endangered species? Maybe you could fund research that might find the cure for cancer.

The billionaire family in this documentary decided to build the largest home in America, just for their own nuclear family.

This is a story of the silly rich. At first, the absurdity is hard to believe.  David and Jacqueline Siegel feel they are very important, because- well, apparently because they have money. When the recession hits it hits hard and their half finished dream house, modeled after Versailles, turns out to be just a dream after all. But who can they find in the post-bubble economy who can afford to buy their $100 million dollar home?

The whole list of financial mistakes is here. The husband is a time-share king who built too fast on borrowed money. When everything bottoms out, those creditors come knocking. More mistakes are revealed. For instance, the man took out a mortgage on his current 26,000 sq. ft. home that he paid cash for and owned free and clear, only to put that money back into his business. There was no ""cushion"" and no plan in case anything went wrong. Because nothing was supposed to go wrong.

The new money saving regimen hits his wife Jackie hardest. She simply doesn't know how. She's a spender, through and through. It was easy to have seven kids when you have a houseful of servants to care for them. And when you're used to throwing lavish parties with a full complement of wait staff it can be hard to learn to cut back.

This is an interesting twist on the subprime mortgage bubble story and shows how big business people can get themselves over their heads by spending money they don't really have.

Edit:
Watching this for the second time, different things stand out for me. Like the fact that the kids seem positively bored opening their Christmas gifts and seem to be getting repeats of things they already have.
like the fact Jackie seems to buy three of everything- three Operation games, three of the exact same hoodie.
like the contemptible attitude Siegel's grown son seems to have toward the people who put their hard earned money into his father's business, allowing him to amass a great fortune.
Like Jackie buying a new bike for her son, just to see it added to the fleet of bicycles already in the garage.
And the fact that everyone appears to be doing their own thing in different rooms of their large house, totally oblivious to the others.

It makes me wonder if Paris Hilton's dogs have the same liberty. I actually don't know the first thing about dog ownership, but I'm guessing that getting your animals to avoid casual excretion on rugs would be somewhere near the top of the list. Perhaps the Queen's servants had traditionally let the dogs outside to do their business, and when they were laid off, the Queen and her family couldn't be bothered to let the dogs out?

[3] The Queen of Versailles, or TQOV (the sheer insanity).
Learning about Enron fills one with anger and despair; learning about the birth of Silicon Valley fills one with awe and perhaps inspiration; TQOV simply boggles the mind.

While TQOV gives you plenty of ammunition to hate the Queen, it was her ignorance (obliviousness) that I hated rather than the person. It's interesting to me that she had the intelligence to become an engineer, yet promptly threw that away to become a gold digger (and by that I don't mean someone toiling away at hard labor in a gold mine). The paradox: while cruelty seems not to be part of her nature, her lifestyle offsets any virtues she may have. Her indifference to anything outside of her fantasy world is disturbing, since it is incumbent (in this day and age) on someone with that much wealth to at least understand the world they take from. Regardless, with this Queen we don't get the impression of a ""Let them eat cake"" attitude; perhaps she was on her best behavior when the camera was rolling?
The Filipinos who remain with the family to the bitter end seem to be indentured servants (loving the children they raised, how could they walk away?)

In sum: TQOV shows us the true face of capitalism. And it isn't pretty.",1426896000,12,2528,5.39493670886076

Not only did this family whine almost continuously about their perceived lack of money (while still being very wealthy),but they treated their employees abysmally. I cried when I heard their nanny say that she had not seen her  son since he was very young, but now he was an adult. Here were these selfish people (the Siegels) building a ridiculously large mansion--with expensive and elaborate furnishings in storage awaiting the completion of the building--and it never once occurred to them that this woman might like to see her own family? With all the millions they spent on themselves, they never considered gifting her with a trip to see her family, or to bring them for a visit? The depth of callousness is astounding. Then there are the children who are too lazy to take care of their animals (and why isn't the SPCA involved?), but neglect them to the point of death for some of the poor creatures. At one point, the mother tells her children that they need to find a loose snake because it might eat the puppies! Thankfully, the puppies are found. And the way they talk about each other, with so much disdain and lack of respect--this is a very unhappy family. Still, they are unhappy because of their own actions. Unfortunately, their actions make others unhappy, too, such as their employees and animals. I hope seeing themselves like this will motivate them to change, but that's not likely. It's difficult to rate this because the people are so awful, but the people who made the documentary did do a good job of showing what kind of people the Siegels are.

It was difficult to believe that these extremely wealthy people, who built a fortune on the cruddy time-share business,  could be as crude and thoughtless as they came across, and even more difficult to believe that they would eagerly trot out their tasteless vulgarity for the filmmaker to show to the whole world.  However, apparently they didn't really know what they were doing because after this film premiered, David Seigel sued the filmmaker, alleging that the things he and his wife Jackie said in it weren't ""the truth.""
Gilded thrones, portraits of themselves dressed in regal robes like 17th century nobility, the desire to have more and more ""because I can"", quoth David Seigel (the plans to build a 90,000 sq ft house and call it ""Versailles""), plastic boobs, blouses cut with grotesque openings to showcase those plastic boobs, too many pets, dying pets, dead pets in their aquariums, dogs that poop all over the house, Filipino nannies apparently paid so little that one has not seen her children in 11 years.  THe poor Filipino nanny seems to live in a bedroom the size of a closet, in spite of the fact that the family she is caring for lives in a 26,000 sq ft house.
It was disgusting to hear David Seigel's son Richard talk about his contemptible view of his time-share clients.  He called them ""mooches"" and talked about how he strategized to take advantage of their ""greed"" about getting something for nothing --potential clients are roped into listening to a 90 minute sales pitch on time shares, in exchange for getting free tickets to Disneyworld.  Well if that is greed then what do you call David Seigel's (admitted) addiction to the ""cheap money"" that banks lend out to finance more and more timeshare resorts?
  I felt embarrassed at how dopey one would have to be to buy a timeshare, which are apparently all but impossible to sell -- so that timeshares bought for thousands of dollars are selling for a dollar or two.  From the timeshare sales pitch shown, it seemed clear to me that the poor suckers buying into timeshares are nobodies with nothing going on in their lives, whose idea of being somebody is to be able to say that they own a share of the same building that a Hollywood celebrity stays in.

One would have thought that after attaining such wealth, being threatened with losing everything, as David Seigel was with the 2008 financial meltdown, would generate some humility and regret in him.  It would in the average person.  But not David Seigel -- he never became humble or regretful, only grumpy and irritable and more of a workaholic, staying up late and scolding his family about leaving lights on, trying to find ""how to get some money...I just need $300 million."" Asked if he found his family supportive, he said no, and admitted that he viewed his wife as simply like one of his children.

Well somehow he got some money, as 6 years later now, he is once again shown in news clips vowing to ""pay whatever it takes"" to continue to build his Versailles, his 90,000 sq ft McMansion, which would be the largest single family home in the USA.",1414713600,3,3169,4.696750902527076

They are still ""real"" people and subject to the same emotional upheavals as the ""rest of us"".

Really? They work harder than the guy digging ditches?  I've always suspected that this attitude--the NEED to express this attitude, covers up their suppressed feelings of guilt--and response they go overboard the other direction.  I didn't see quite as much of that attitude from this family, and in fact it seemed to me that the film-maker captured their emotional complexity--delight at being able to have all of their toys; a sense of responsibility to others; stress and tension to maintain a strained lifestyle in a poor economy; guilt over keeping secrets (primarily in an effort to protect and not disappoint); love; worry; loss; sorrow--and in the end, relief.

What's remarkable is not how different the ber rich Sigels are but how common and relatable.

I don't repeat the story of a billionaire couple and their unfinished 90,000-square-foot mansion. You can easily find it elsewhere. The Queen of Versailles offers an intimate picture of their life during both pre and post Lehman Brothers collapse.

The film is sometimes funny, sometimes depressing, mostly interesting because of the King and the Queen of the film. It is also hard to resist a touch of Schadenfreude here. At the same time, however, the film does not offer an insightful look into what made them what they are.

I see a lot of negative from reviewers about this film. From the title I assumed it was something completely different than what it was. I think I assumed it was about what it appears to originally be intended (a film about the lifestyle of the new super-rich). But that's not what this film is about. What it's ACTUALLY about is the real estate crash and what it did to these people's lives.

I love these people

Anyone who knows me well knows that for years I have struggled with a personal issue: In the past I have grown to hate rich people. Many find this odd given that I once was one myself (though I didn't realize it at the time). I grew up surrounded by rich snobs who treated me like dirt, and became terminally depressed as a teen. As I grew older and realized the plight of poor people, I became filled with (what to me seemed) righteous indignation. I still struggle with those feelings, but I strive to love everyone. Interestingly, the people who are the subject of this documentary are easy to love. They seem to represent the very best of this class of people (from my personal experience). They're warm, friendly, cheerful, and good-hearted people (or at least that's how they come across to me). They are tasteless and crass in some ways, excessive, selfish, and eccentric, but neither one is stupid, and the wife earned some serious admiration from me as the documentary progressed. Strange as it sounds, they are the kind of people I wouldn't mind having as friends.

The Fall of An Empire

I was living in Anaheim California during the Real Estate crash of 2008, and had nothing to do except sit around unemployed and watch the shocking story unfold on CSPAN. It was the best political soap-opera I have ever witnessed. Seeing how it personally effected people heavily invested in the real estate business was incredibly compelling for me, as it's an angle I haven't seen before (we've all seen loads of footage of poor people with balloon mortgages losing their houses, but I never considered what would happen to a heavily leveraged business that made it's money off of real estate).

This whole story felt eerily familiar to me. My parents lost everything in the California Construction Industry Crash, and I watched them go through almost the exact same process. I watched my father sold off resources desperately trying to salvage his business as my mother continued to buy cases of bottled water at 1.50 plus per bottle. I watched it happen in shock after years of telling them (who takes business advice from a 12 year old?) that they needed to invest and set money aside for emergencies. And like these people, my parents had built their life up from hard work. They weren't born rich.

The Best Rich Wife in America

I've seen plenty of rich women in my time living in both Orange Counties (Orlando and California) and I'm here to tell you, they don't come better than the wife shown here. Is she self-absorbed? Sure. Does she spend money like crazy? Yeup! Is she out of touch and overly concerned with her appearance? Sure, sure. BUT!!!! This woman CLEARLY has a head on her shoulders and a heart of gold.

She didn't come across as having much class, but this woman is LOYAL. She is obviously a trophy wife, and she knows it, but she is appreciative of what she has. She got a degree and a first-class job at IBM, and then left because she realized it would be wasting her life (I work at IBM and know exactly what she means). That takes guts. She married a man who treated her decently (even if his appreciation for her was shallow) and spent all her money on creating a fun life with a big family (a much smarter thing to do than being a miser who worries about losing what they have).

When things turn south and the big life she had evaporates, where is her head at? Is she crying over her lost house? Yelling at the kids and dogs? Arguing with her husband? Cursing out the greedy banks? Nope. She says she ought to take some pictures to remember the good times. If she moves into a middle class sized house (to her that would be like living in a shack) she says she'll make it work. When her husband is being a jerk because he's stressed out of his mind she takes his point of view, telling the kids that he's going through a lot. Even with her whole world collapsing, she still wants to show affection to her husband to reassure him that she still loves him and is on his side. What a woman!

Enjoy it While it Lasts

I agree with these people 100%. As my dear old dad once said, the government should have given the bail-outs to the people. Because they just would have paid their bills to the banks with it or spent it anyway. Instead the bailouts went to the banks who then sat on the money because they are greedy and paranoid and the economy entered a depression as a result (idiots). As a student of economics, I can definitely tell you that would have been a better solution. Heck, you could see how upsetting it was to the man to see all those employees who used to get a living off of him gone. He did everything in his power to keep the business moving. More than can be said for the banks that wanted to take his buildings and then change their minds about letting him stay in business.

I remember when my parents were losing everything and my mother kept right on spending, and some things that she did. Once she asked me if I wanted a tuxedo. I said no, because I didn't think we could afford it. She said the money would be spent anyway and I would never have another chance. I got the tux. Another time she offered me a new leather jacket. Same deal. And finally, years later when she won a lawsuit she gave me the money to take a few days to Disney World for my honeymoon. Could my mother afford to do any of these things? Nope. But I was married in that tux. I made priceless memories on that honeymoon. If I did it over again I would change nothing. My point? Anyone who criticizes a woman who used to be super-rich and is losing everything for buying Christmas presents and eating caviar doesn't understand what they are going through. This woman had spending habits that were hard to break. And she was enjoying the last of what was left. I wouldn't begrudge her any of it. Because in the end, she was worth it.

Entertaining

Ultimately, if you enjoyed watching Inside Job, Sicko, or reading books like Richistan, or especially I.O.U. you will probably enjoy this film. Just moreso if you have ever been in their shoes and/or lived in Orlando Florida (my favorite place on Earth, and the place I will always consider my real home).",1397779200,5,6632,4.451400329489291
5277073,4,B0097RU2LO,"The film could be subtitled ""The 7 Deadly Sins: wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony"". While David Siegel gloats about his ability to make money and his political clout in getting George Bush elected ""illegally"", the banking crisis of 2008 undermines his highly leveraged time share business and he faces bankruptcy. His trophy wife, Jackie, 30 years younger, is a shop-a-holic who he seems to have little respect for. He is obsessed with trying to find a solution to his economic troubles, and virtually ignores his 8 children who are raised by their nannies. Construction on their 90,000 sq. ft. mansion, ""Versailles"", is halted, and they have to settle for living in their 26,000 sq. ft. home with only 4 nannies. The house is over-run with pet snakes and dogs who leave their droppings on the floor. Fortunately, most of the kids are screened from too much attention in the film.

The hubris and greed of this couple was hard to watch. Their ostentatious life style is focused on spending and owning - homes, cars, airplane, jewelry, shoes, bags - Jackie bragged that she spent a million dollars a year on her wardrobe; and yet she looks trashy with extremely tight clothing revealing her huge fake breasts, spiked heels worn with her short shorts, and long stringy blond hair. Her husband hardly notices her, and has no time for his children. She claims to know nothing about their money troubles except the fact that he says she has to be on a budget; however he doesn't take away her credit cards. For Christmas, she went on a shopping spree at what looked like Walmart, throwing items in the cart without even looking at them. And she bought herself a $2,000 tin of caviar (obviously NOT at Walmart...)

In a play for sympathy, there is one highly staged scene where she makes the kids part with some of their belongings, and loads them into the car to take them to the local charity. To celebrate David's birthday, she (or more likely the nannies) cooks a family dinner which is served in foil pans on the dining room table with no placemats or napkins and the kids eating with their hands. At one point Jackie complains that none of the government bailout money to the banks has actually been used to help the ""common"" people like themselves.

I really wonder why this family allowed themselves to be the subject of this documentary - did they really think that people were going to admire them and look up to them? It's a revealing glimpse into the life of one super-rich couple, and makes me quite satisfied with my much more modest life style !",1395878400,2,2573,4.675496688741722

The fact that filming began before the family's financial problem hits presents an interesting contrast--at first, everyone is playing it up as an upbeat reality tv show (although I have never watched more than a few minutes of any such show); later, as financial worries intrude, there is an air of negative social commentary as this family tries to carry on under threat of foreclosures and with a reduced staff and hundreds of laid off workers.  This, no doubt, is why the family has attempted to sue the filmmakers.  Anyway, these people are trying to build the world's largest and most obscenely rococo single-family residence, to replace the sad little thing on their private island.

I felt sorry for the nanny, the employees that were laid off, and the neglected pets.  There were some parts that were mildly amusing, but I was disgusted by the state of the house (with dog feces, dead animals, nasty fish tanks, sinks piled with dirty dishes, cluttered living spaces.)  I guess that goes to show that even a home worth millions can look horrible on the inside.

I found that I didn't feel sorry for the family, as they were having to ""cut-back"" to only several staff, but they were still maintaining their lavish lifestyle of shopping, botox, charity events, etc.  It was entertaining to see ""The Queen"" have to do budget cuts and go from using a private jet to commercial air, renting a car, and assuming that a commercial rental car company came with a driver.

I guess I was entertained enough to watch the whole thing, but mostly out of sheer disbelief that someone could have that much money, be so spoiled, and buy the crazy items that they did.  Would anyone love to have that much money?  Of course, and I don't believe they are bad people-just a product of what having more money than you know what to do with, then having a harsh reality check when it is (mostly) taken away.

""The Queen of Versailles"" is touching, shocking, moving, and entertaining all rolled up into one documentary. I found myself firstly appalled at the amount of excess that they had by way of money, property and ""things"". But I wasn't so appalled that I couldn't find them a bit likable. Then it continues and discusses the financial hardships his timeshare company has gone through, how it has affected his employees and also how it has affected his very own family. You can't help but feel bad for them that they were so far removed from reality that they are struggling to live a lifestyle that STILL is way above average. This disconnect prevents them from successfully running and operating a household, even though they have quite a few children, someone else in America is currently running their homes just fine without all of the help and excess.

There seems to be genuine love in that family, but it's tainted by the greed that he has within him, trying to still ""have it all"". And that attitude may end up causing him to ""lose it all"" (his family). He is so consumed by finding a way to keep it all that he is unhappy. His unhappiness spills out into his household and is visibly apparent in his physical health. Would he make some humbling decisions to sell what he needed to, he could still have his family, health, and a lifestyle that most would see as a blessing to live.

This documentary proves that money can't buy you love, health, or happiness. I felt very solemn after watching it, but grateful at the same time. I love my life! I will never have even a smidgen of wealth that they have had or may have again, and to be honest with you, I don't even desire it. This documentary solidified that mentality for me today.

I'm grateful that they were so candid. I think it takes a lot of strength to do that. My prayers for them are that they truly focus on the important stuff and grow closer as a family through this.

That will all be flipped on its head as despite the excesses of this family, they do come across as fairly engaging to watch and learn about. You do gain empathy if not sympathy for the sheer audacity of the husband to be so tunnel visioned to fall into so many financial traps.

I won't ruin it for you but it certainly does not paint the time share industry in a great light when you see the behind-the-scenes workings of it all. It also goes to show that money certainly does not buy love or happiness.

What baffles me more than anything is how the patriarch did not, while the going was good, just sock away a ton of money away from the creditors not only for himself but for his wife and each of their seven children's futures.

The extravagant home attempting to be the largest in America is Doanld Trumpesque in its sheer ugly gaudiness. I mean, seriously, who thinks the Palace at Versailles is a model of ""beauty"" in the 21st century? It's just old and excessive and did none of these people ever read about what happened to the royalty in France?

5277099,5,B0097RU2LO,"""The Queen of Versailles"" is the true story of David and Jacqueline Siegel, who made their fortune during the time-share boom of the early 2000s, only to lose much of it during the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble of 2008. The movie is a compelling documentary compiled from 200 plus hours of footage of the Siegels during these years. We see them living in an already lavishly furnished 19,000 sq. foot house as their fortune rapidly increases, spending enormous sums of money on all sorts of baubles. We watch as construction takes place on what they hope will be their new mansion, a 90,000 sq. foot replica of Versailles. Seemingly the only reason they have for building such an elaborate and over the top structure is because with their wealth they can.

And then come the financial reverses. Construction is halted on Versaillles. It sits half completed and gathering dust. David Siegel goes from being an effusive, seemingly happy fellow to a cantankerous old man, so concerned about the size of his electric bill that he scolds the other family members for leaving lights on when they leave the room. Jacqueline, meanwhile, tries hard to retain the trappings of wealth, an increasingly difficult task because she has had to lay off almost all of her household staff.

Through it all, the movie remains true to its documentary status. At no time do we feel that we are being preached to. We are simply given the facts and hear the words of the Siegels themselves as they react both to their successes and reversals. We are left to judge for ourselves whether they are fundamentally good or corrupt people and whether ultimately they are tragic or comic figures.

At the same time we see the truth in the saying that two things reveal a person's true character more than anything else--abject poverty and enormous wealth. After watching ""The Queen of Versailles"" I was reminded of the words of Agar son of Jakeh: ""Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.""",1382486400,2,1997,4.782608695652174

What I can not understand is how someone so clueless as Siegel could have possibly created such a financial empire. I'm in awe of his accomplishment and his ignorance at the same time. Mind blowing. But it does not stop with Mr. Siegel. No, the entire family seems to suffer from the same delusions.

Half way thru the movie I had to put it on pause to run to the web to see if this was a real movie or a mockumentary.

It's real. Okay back to the movie.

On the one hand I really did feel for these people. I was inspired by their success but dumbfounded by their lack of humility, empathy & decency. I can't help but wonder if the filmmaker had a story they wanted to tell and this family provided the raw footage to tell it. Either they were treated very unfairly, or they are the most clueless people on the planet. Yes, money really does grow on trees, and not only that but you don't even have to harvest it, you just hire someone to rake it all up and bring it to you in baskets overflowing.

I highly recommend the movie.

Note: One thing I noticeed here on Amazon is how some reviewers try to equate this movie with capitalism and the American culture. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reason this family stands out is because it is so abhorrent to the American culture. To those who would wish to use this movie for their political agenda, I say, baloney.

I have been to their timeshare sales pitch and almost got roped in (review might be biased because of that). Seeing the founder of the company makes you understand why the salespeople act how they do. They are blatantly told to lie. David Siegel admits to illegal business handling's as well as 'screwing' a creditor out for paying them what he owes, the same way he screwed his employees in Myrtle Beach. Timeshares aside they seem like rich people that aren't rich anymore. They're struggling financially. The husband seems 'stuck' with an aged beauty queen which he pretty much says himself. The kids run the house, the wife has no clue and the maids are treated like slaves. I read that Jackie Siegel is shopping around a reality show or trying to get in on the housewife series, and that pretty much sums up this documentary. A family that is desperately trying to portray and image that is no longer the case. As far as their 'House of Versailles' it sits in Central Florida in the same condition it has for many years. They claim work is begun on it again but there has been no proof of that.  If you can tolerate the housewives series you'll probably like this documentary.",1368489600,2,1317,4.604255319148936

We all experienced - at some level or another - the financial crisis of 2008-2009 - and theirs it's just another story to tell. From the hubris of building the biggest house in America ""a la Versailles"", to not even being able to make their mortgage payment. Watch it, it's a caricature of any other American family.",1367539200,,545,4.628865979381444
5277171,4,B0097RU2LO,"First of all, let me say that, in the long view, the Siegels are pretty awful people. That doesn't mean that they're totally evil, or anything close to it; they are, as far as I can tell, not deliberately mean (to anyone's face, anyway), and no more innately malicious than some rare orchid that thrives in a hothouse. But some hothouses deserve to be torn down.

David Siegel grew very rich by selling timeshares in condos to people who could barely afford them, if that. A timeshare condo is not a very good deal--on the cheaper end, where they pull in the people who are lured into their weekend-long sales pitch by the promise of a free vacation (just like the ones that you get unsolicited on your cell phone from numbers halfway across the country from you)--you pay way too much for what amounts to a hotel room with a kitchenette, and if you can't fit in a vacation on the few days that you have it, you're SOL and still have to make your payments. (Note: There may be different deals available out there, but this is the basic definition of a timeshare.) The irony of this is that Siegel himself is really no more of an owner than his timeshare serfs; almost his entire fortune is tied up in heavily mortgaged properties, and when the real estate bubble bursts in 2008, most of that ""wealth"" evaporates, and he's left with a half-built shell of his enormous dream mansion, which has little to do with the real Versailles (it seems to be based largely on another Vegas hotel/casino/monstrosity). So, he tries to sell it... the problem is that most people who could afford his $75 million price tag would probably want to build their own dream mansion to their own specific plans and needs.

So, the family has to get by with ""only"" four or so servants, instead of the nineteen that they had previously employed; since they are not used to having to walk their own dogs, excrement and urine litters the floors of their current mansion, which although it's quite large seems jammed with the gaudy junk that Jackie can't stop buying. (One of the most striking scenes in the doco has Jackie condescending to shop at Wal-Mart for toys, and includes a bicycle in her haul... which she puts next to a big pile of bikes in the garage that don't seem to be getting any use.) In the meantime, David won't let go of the huge Vegas time-share towers that he's got the bulk of his fortune in, even though doing so would solve all of his money problems, and take care of his family. (It's revealed that he hasn't even set aside money for his kids' college funds, even as he started construction on a house that would have been the third biggest house in American history, and the only one that would be currently used as a residence.)

And, concurrently with their sliding into the lives of the shabby genteel, we hear from one of their maids, who has moved into the kids' playhouse; the chauffeur, who lost all of his money on his own real estate speculations; and Jackie's childhood friend, who although she got a $5000 gift from Jackie(as I said, they're not really evil) to save her house, was unable to do so because the bank wouldn't stop foreclosure proceedings, even though the original shortfall on the mortgage was far less than that. It's very similar to many other stories from the Great Recession and an effective antidote for feeling too sorry for the reduced lifestyle of the rich and self-indulgent.

The film ends with David barking at his family for leaving the lights on, which might be almost funny in a sitcom kind of way if it weren't for their obvious terror of offending him and having him cut off the gravy train entirely (he's on his third marriage). In an ironic counterpoint, he finally has to sell a controlling share in his Vegas property, and the Westgate sign (the name of his company) on top of the towers is shut off.

It's worth noting that Westgate has recovered some of its value, and the Siegels have announced that construction has continued on ""Versailles."" What's unclear is whether or not they intend to live there. I understand that they have some face-saving to do (they unsuccessfully sued both the filmmakers and Sundance), maybe they've had time to experience a little buyers' remorse. After all, look what happened to the Bourbon dynasty...",1367366400,3,4282,4.606815203145478
5277172,4,B0097RU2LO,"This documentary is almost unbelievable on so many levels.  The megaegotistical husband, the 30 years younger Barbie doll wife with breast implants seldom seen outside of a strip club, the 8 kids Jackie gave birth to plus 5 others he produced with other wives.  (We only see one of the older sons who is in business with his father but has no father-son relationship.)  This was filmed over a period of several years featuring a dog poop laden mansion, dead animals from neglect, a husband who turns on his family when the economy goes sour, a wife who lives in lala land and can't stop spending even when their finances are in crisis.  It's amazing that these entitled, self-centered individuals came from modest circumstances and that bimbo Jackie actually has a degree in engineering.  The filming continued over about 4 years.  In that time they went from riches to rags, well almost, and had to stop construction on their Versalles, which at 90,000 square feet would be the largest house in America.  The film ends with David, the husband, trying to figure out how to deal with the decline of his time share empire and his personal wealth.  David, in his mid 70's comes across as a person who cares mainly for himself and his business.  The sexy wife and kids are just fluff.  He has an eye for young women in the 20's.  I hope Jackie has an iron clad preneptual as she is now in her mid 40's.

It might be interesting to note that this film was shown on the Bravo TV Network in April 2013, and Jackie was interviewed afterward.  According to her, they are back on top again and wealthier than ever.  Construction on Versalles has resumed and will take about 3 years to complete.  You really have to watch the documentary to get the full impact of all of the best of everything, gaudy, unnecessary, over the top, money is no object features that are going to be in this home.  It's interesting to note that when their financial fortune was in trouble,  it was stated this couple had put no money aside for the college education of their litter of children and Jackie was concerned about where the money would come from to pay for their schooling.

Now that, according to Jackie, they're on top of the world again, I hope they can hire enough help to keep the house clean and animals alive. It's pitiful to see reptiles of all sorts that have died in their cases because they weren't given food or water... apparently from neglect rather than a desire to harm them. Jackie ran over her favorite dog and hubby had it stuffed. It's on display in the house.  This film goes to show that all the money in the world can't buy good taste.

Oh yes, start a college fund for your children incase business goes belly up again.  As I said it the opening sentence, unbelievable unless you see the film.",1367280000,3,2795,4.5168986083499005
5277173,1,B0097RU2LO,"We started to watch it based on the high user reviews.  But after 5-10 minutes, we just couldn't get into the story.  While we were amazed at the wealth we couldn't see sitting though another hour+ of it.",1367020800,,204,4.342105263157895
5277174,5,B0097RU2LO,"I decided to watch this documentary after I saw previews of it.  I have no regrets of watching this documentaty and I recommended it to everyone I know.  This is a story of David Siegel and his third wife (Jackie) and their 8 children (7 biological and one adopted niece).  Siegel made his wealth by selling time shares.  His business became family venture and two of his sons from two of his previous marriages are involved with the business.

One of the deciding factors for making this movie was Siegel's decision several years ago to build the largest privately own home in the United States and call it ""Versailles"".  Like typical American new rich Siegel would stop at nothing to show off his wealth.  This house was supposed to cost him $75 million.  All was good until one day financial crises hits, people start loosing jobs and vacations, let alone timeshares stopped selling.  Stuck with huge loans from the banks, for his enourmous empire, Siegel starts to experience financial strain.  It starts small, from laying off people to trying to preserve his home and one of the most valued assets he had in Las Vegas.  During that entire time, his faily is unable to cope with their basic responsibilities such as keeping the house clean, feeding family pets, controlling the budget.  His wife takes a limo to get her lunch and MacDonalds on her way to the plastc surgeon where she undergoes laser and Botox treatment for her skin.  In the meantime their children are moved from private to public schools and there are no guarantees they will even have money to go to college (with trust funds gone, these kinds will have to take out student loans if they want higher education).

From every point of view, this film is something else.  These people are so detached from reality and the meaning of real care and compassion for other people and animals that is heartbreaking to watch.  It is as if they live in their own fairy tale unable to accept the reality of their situation.  It is as if bad things can only happen to other people and not to anyone else.  The most amazing thing to me is that Siegel still believes that he can get his time share empire back.  And I fully understood the irony of it when a collegue of mine said ""Do people still buy and keep time shares these days?"".  Even in documentary, they mention that many of the time share places are under foreclosures.  If time shareowners knew they were loosing their ""properties"" they would pretty much stop making their payments and cut their loses.  But instead, they are sort of financing lifestyles of the time share owners who are destined for doom.

I do not feel sorry for suckers who buy time share nor for the sellers of time share business.  I always thought it was the scam.  And after you hear Siegel and his family members talk disparigingly about buyers of time share business perhaps you will agree with me and not find this opinion to be too harsh.  Worth seeing.  It will stay imbedded in your psyche for a long time after you saw this documentary.

the woman is presented as being at times inane, insipid and ineffectual but we're also told she was an engineer
there is no character development, the husband and wife are presented as being extremely shallow individuals- who were at one time extremely, extremely wealthy and now apparently only wealthy.
He is extremely self-satisfied- kind of figures considering the money he's made and that seems to have been his goal in life. She is weirdly flat emotionally, there's a kind of unreal character to her that I almost found fascinating and often found annoying. But that may be my problem....

5277206,4,B0097RU2LO,"This documentary is pretty interesting and it confused me. The reason it confused me is because i wasn't sure if I should feel sorry for the people or not give a crap. Truth is, I don't feel sorry at all for them, though I can understand that even wealthy people have hardships and life struggles. The documentary follows the family of David Siegel, CEO of Westgate Resorts. When filming began for this documentary, business was booming. Mr. Siegel and his wife were building the largest house in the country and were at the height of their lives. However, that all changed when the recession hit and banks began to tighten credit. The business fell and it fell hard. Construction on the house was halted and they had to sell off assets just to stay afloat.

The the start of the documentary you don't like the people. They seem stuck up, full of themselves and very materialistic. However, it seems as though the recession humbled them and made them realize that there are other more important things to life. At the same time though, Mr. Siegel never seems to stop caring about money. His days are all devoted to saving his company even at the expense of his relationship with his family. Its always hard to judge people who are in documentaries because you never know how they are edited, though the wife seems to really have a change in her worldview after the recession, but still spoiled and still very ignorant to real world and real life.

All in all, this is a very interesting and engaging documentary. It is interesting to tag along a very wealthy family during the high and during the low. You start to feel sorry for them, which seems almost unethical and stupid. This isn't an intellectual documentary but it is very interesting and recommended.",1363046400,2,1759,4.670967741935484

5277208,4,B0097RU2LO,As a Westgate time share owner the documentary was particularly interesting. Showed how David Siegal's opportunist qualities got him far and how success also came with challenges. I gather that the producers of the documentary did not reveal their intended portrayal  of the Siegals and that perhaps allowed them to comfortably  share much information of their personal lives and the challenges that they faced  in dealing with with relationships and finances when the ecomony crashed. Jackie Seegal carries her sexiness well and its also interesting how she carries it in the course of the documentary. Worth watching.,1362614400,2,619,5.360824742268041
5277209,4,B0097RU2LO,"This is a fascinating movie since it may be the only documentary to capture someone who considers himself a ""master of the universe"" at the beginning of the film but the subject's finances deteriorate dramatically.

I must be one of the few reviewers who think David S. doesn't look too terrible in this movie. He married a trophy wife and he essentially admits to this. Jackie comes off favorably in the first 20 minutes but she's too smart for us to pity her by the end when she tries to use her ignorance in her favor.

The main lesson is to live within your means. The #1 goal for making a ton of money is so that one doesn't have to worry about money again. David S. made some critical mistakes to allow himself in the situation where he is stressing every day about money.

This movie reminds me of Tom Wolfe's novel, A Man in Full. Maybe marrying a trophy wife leads to this pattern where the wealthy spouse feels the need to impress the younger partner, and the spending (ie, conspicuous consumption) reaches unsustainable levels.

If I have some qualms with the movie, it's that some key facts are not clearly laid out in the movie. Jackie is David's third wife--there can be 0 doubt in her mind that she's a trophy wife and that she should have an iron-clad pre-nup for the likely/eventual divorce. I have to assume they didn't want to discuss pre-nup terms on camera because it would be fascinating to find out their thought processes on those. Finally, it's pretty obvious that Jackie S. had breast implants at some time, but I wish the movie went ahead and said when that occurred because I decided to search online to confirm this.

TL/DR: If you have wanted to see what characters from Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full are like in real life, here's your chance.",1362355200,2,1785,4.496913580246914

5277228,4,B0097RU2LO,"This is a well-done documentary of a nouveau riche business tycoon and his trophy wife and family and the absurd farce in which they exist.  I was horrified that the husband had the wife's dog stuffed after it died, and displayed it in a glass box like some macabre toy.  Even worse was another dead pet's hide and fur preserved and thrown across the baby grand piano top.

Even more disturbing was the older daughter's complete lack of shame or remorse when it was discovered that she'd let her 'pet' lizard starve to death.  No one but the camera crew noticed the exotic dead fish in a filthy aquarium.  And though the house was home to multiple dogs, the only family member to acknowledge or pet one was the old guy, after his fall from grace.  At that point, he only had kind words for a dog; certainly not for the wife, once age and stress had begun to take their toll on her face and figure.

The viewer has to know, going into this film, that it's going to be a huge downer.  Sure, they're arrogant and full of hubris at the beginning, but less than 35 minutes into it, triumph has turned into tragedy.  The economic collapse of 2008 was particularly unkind on these people who were building their castle (named Versailles) on an illusion that could not persist.  If it teaches us anything, this film teaches us that money is like a drug.  Get a taste and you want more, so that too much is never enough.

What do you say about, trashy, entitled, spoiled, unappealing rich people who get a reality check? Serves them right? Yes except I never felt that they were the least bit humbled by their circumstances. Jackie was a real gem. Cleavage out to here with her LARGE enhanced breasts and 8 kids who she clearly didn't know how to care for or discipline without the nanny's help. The fact that she said she wouldn't have had so many kids if she'd known that there wouldn't be nannies around was a stunner in itself. Add to all the kids, many barking, pooping dogs, a filthy house, dead pets and a sullen and absent dad and you have one of the the most pathetic families I've seen in quite some time...possibly ever.

Watching neglected pets die and hearing a nanny's comments about not seeing her own children in 11 years just depressed me. Are the Siegels so clueless that they didn't know, or care that the nanny hadn't seen her children in 11 years? Couldn't they have given the poor woman a bonus and a vacation so that she could go home and see her kids? Or better yet, paid her well enough so she could have put money away. Couldn't they afford fish food? Water for the poor damn dying lizard? To keep the python locked up so it wouldn't eat the puppies? It was all just so appalling.

I did laugh at the complete lack of insight by David who was bragging about helping ""W"" get elected. I wonder if he ever was  able to figure out that ""W"" was one of the contributing factors of his financial empire going from billions to mere millions which in turn resulted in many thousands of employees losing their jobs. Oh the irony!

Not only could I not relate to these people but I had zero sympathy for all of them. This movie, on my quiet peaceful snowy afternoon made me feel completely enraged and quite sad at the same time. These people were maybe one step up from Honey Boo Boo territory and that's sure not saying much. I take solace in the fact that not all very rich people are trashy like this. There are the Warren Buffets and Bill Gates of the world who use much of their wealth for the good of society and I would think that they have put a little money away for college educations for their children.

Weighing the hardships people endured against a family that can spend $1400 on a pair of shoes or $2000 on a can of caviar, makes this story compelling.

In truth, just another greedy jew that thinks everything in the world is against him when in fact he, did EXACTLY what the predatory lenders did that got us into this economic disaster. He sold property to people that couldn't afford it, to cash in from the banks so he could pyramid that into more and more wealth for guess who????
HIMSELF!!
They even keep saying it's not about the money, when it's ""ALL"" about the money to that family. Who needs to build a 100 million dollar home he built to move from one mansion to another bigger mansion, or to have warehouses to  store and collect more wealth if it isn't about the money?

I see plenty of money made, for a tiny few people to live like kings, but what I didn't see was any bonding or love for each other in this movie. They didn't seem to even LIKE each other, and the kids were spoiled little jerks. The one girl let her pets DIE, because she too lazy to even get them water, and then delivers a guilt trip with snotty attitude to her mother for even mentioning it.
I hope the money ""IS"" taken out of their hands, and given to someone that has a clue what's important in life, and would use some money to benefit others rather than just get rich off them.

Schadenfreude is a word that comes to English from the German language; it signifies pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. And after just half an hour of the wretched excesses perpetrated by David and Jacqueline Siegel, a pair of nouveau riche Florida Republicans whose failed financial speculation put many hundreds out of work and impoverished thousands, you will wish for more misfortune to fall upon their heads than this simultaneously entertaining and horrifying documentary can possibly deliver.

Before he became a king of his industry, David was a commoner who stumbled upon a clever scheme: building and selling vacation timeshares by convincing average folks to accrue debt and feign wealth for a few days every year. As he opines with a shrug, ""If you don't want to be rich, you must be dead."" After making a mint in the process of developing one of the largest timeshare companies in the world, Westgate Resorts, he married a former Mrs. America, bought an enormous house, and decided they needed to climb even higher on the ladder of success. The Siegels were in the midst of constructing the largest and most expensive private home in America, an outlandish $100 million, 90,000-square-foot edifice in the style of Versailles, when the bottom fell out of the real estate market in 2008, the end of a bubble they themselves helped to inflate.

This honest, unflinching, and frequently unflattering portrait of them and their family might make a good premise for a sitcom in another world. It features a crude, uninvolved buffoon of a father, a mom who dresses and behaves like trailer trash, eight kids whom they spoil rotten, Filipina nannies who haven't seen their own children in years, and a straight-faced driver who calls the Siegels ""down-to-earth."" It reveals a lot about what wealth does to shallow people whose lives are predicated on thoughtless acquisition and ostentatious consumption. For Mr. and Mrs. Siegel are indeed common: the would-be Queen of Versailles, with her huge fake boobs, is like a vulgar child who can't control her appetites, whether she's spending a million dollars a year on gaudy clothes or picking up bags of fast food from McDonald's in a stretch limousine. Even her own daughter calls her a ""trophy wife.""

Jackie's elderly husband, who at times barely tolerates his spouse and their offspring, is obsessed with his business and clearly craves the status derived from associating with billionaires and powerful politicians: he boasts that Donald Trump complained to him about the brightness of the neon sign on his Las Vegas high-rise, and that he single-handedly won Florida for George W. Bush by possibly illegal means. (In 2012 he sent a notorious email to his employees, advising them to vote for Mitt Romney and implying that they might be looking for new jobs if Barack Obama were reelected.)

The recession deepens, and we watch with a mixture of satisfaction and disgust as fate takes the king and queen down a few pegs: they are forced to put their empty shell of a mansion on the market and to fly on a commercial airliner rather than their private jet. Hilarity ensues as Jackie rents a car for the first time and asks the Hertz agent for the name of her driver. Her husband, meanwhile, struggles to keep his company afloat, but he can't sell enough of his properties or raise enough money from investors like Trump to pay the builders of his Las Vegas development, which is hundreds of millions of dollars in arrears and headed for foreclosure. He blames his lenders, of course, who ""got us addicted to cheap money."" Sound familiar? Shedding crocodile tears yet?

The Siegels continue to cut back, laying off 15 of their 19 household staff, taking their children out of private schools and putting them into public ones, and informing the kids that they might actually have to go to college and earn a living for themselves. Can you imagine? The children forget to feed and water a pet lizard, which dies along with their tropical fish, while the house becomes a mess -- dog poop everywhere -- and Jackie herself is pressed into service in the kitchen. She opens a thrift shop for her former employees, who are losing their homes, and stocks it with castoffs from her own home. Yet she continues her absurdly compulsive shopping (though she now goes to Wal-Mart instead of upscale retailers) between visits to a dermatology clinic for facial peels and Botox injections.

We can see where this story is headed long before we arrive at its conclusion: to save his company, David finally sells out and lets the banks take his Las Vegas towers. The massive Florida house stands unfinished, an ineluctable monument to the Siegel's folly and lack of restraint. The viewer is left to contemplate (since the Siegels certainly won't) the combination of greed, hubris, and stupidity that led to this financial debacle, and how the personalities and values of those behind it contributed to its unfolding. Lauren Greenfield has produced a well-made, warts-and-all film that is emblematic of our era and contains plenty of food for thought. Recommended.",1358121600,22,5146,4.955967555040556

5277269,4,B0097RU2LO,"From what I could tell this documentary began as a look at one of the most successful self-made men in America and his much younger trophy wife.  Specifically, they thought the film was about their building of the ""largest house in America,"" a 90,000 square foot indulgence to replace their meager 40,000 s.f. starter home in central Florida. When asked why, Jackie said because he ""deserved it."" David said, ""Because I could.""

David Siegel became the head of the largest time share corporation in the world.  He married a former beauty queen who grew up in rural New York.  Jackie and David each married for the second time and went on to have 8 children.  Jackie admits she only wanted 2 but it became so easy and they had the money, so they just kept going.  After sinking millions ($5 million for Italian tile to be used in the garage!) into the new home (modeled after Versailles in France) the market collapsed and Siegel was unable to get funding from the desperate banks beginning in late 2008.

The focus of the film then becomes what is to happen to the family and the thousands of employees of the firm.  Director and documentarian Lauren Greenfield does a remarkable job, not only giving the viewer a sense of glee watching the family go through perceived crisis after crisis.  Somehow we begin to have a hint of sympathy.  Well, not really.

Still from what was presented, Siegel wasn't a bad business man, didn't make poor investments and didn't try to stiff buyers.  His business depended on huge sums of cash to build and maintain resort time-shares including the largest ever, in Las Vegas.  He didn't create Ponzi schemes or mysterious investment instruments.  Jackie, despite her glaring over indulgence, was kind, generous and conscious of her roots.  Very informative and interesting film.",1357689600,,1811,4.834415584415584

They live in Florida where nannies tend to their eight children, one of whom they ""inherited."" While in the middle of building the largest house in the United States (inspired by Versailles), the economic crisis hits. David's timeshare empire, the biggest in the world, faces severe cutbacks.

Few tears are shed. The Siegels can be hilariously clueless and outrageous, but they also share moments of regret and generosity. As monetary woes sink in, the excess which was a source of pride for the couple becomes a garish nightmare. In spite of her degree in computer engineering, the buxom, botoxed Jackie claims to be in the dark about their financial situation. David becomes consumed with saving his company, often ignoring the rest of his family or lashing out at Jackie, who admits that she is living in a fantasy world. (The movie's apt title recalls Marie Antoinette and her notorious decadence.)

Before the crisis, one of their many children says it best: they never think about money, but they always think about money. The sense of anxiety hanging over the Siegels will be familiar to many Americans, but their opulence will not. David and Jackie blame the banks for lending them too much money, even though David's cutthroat Westgate Resorts dangles the American Dream in front of people who likely can't afford it.

This well-edited movie interviews the Siegels, their children, employees, servants, and old friends. We find out that the hired help have the smallest rooms in the house and haven't seen their family in years. They tend to children who, along with the pets, appear to be accessories. When David embarks on a Citizen Cane like quest to rescue his wealth, it's not difficult to conclude that Jackie, and perhaps all women, are also possessions to many men in the moneyed world. Hints at strained or broken family relationships are also telling.

This searing family portrait illuminates both the current state of the country and the effect of money on the psyche. The film doesn't clearly track the trajectory of David's company, but it does display hollow, disturbing, and even repulsive results of great wealth.",1356739200,9,2299,5.090185676392573

I'm sure they all have the best of intentions (and I'm being generous), but in the real world it never works out that way.  The jobs created are mostly minimum wage jobs, after all, they wouldn't even pay their personal nanny enough to visit her kids back in the Philippines once in 15 years.

Mr. Siegel seems really sincere and I have no doubt he really believes he is doing good and helping people.  But just like everyone in the top 1%, the super rich have no clue what the real world is about and the suffering most people have to go through each and every day just to get by.

Case in point, Mr. Siegel needs to make an $11.8 million payment to the bank for a property he owns but doesn't have the money.  He tries to make a deal, but the bank won't budge.  So he engineers a third party to buy the loan for $3.5 million then pays the third party back, thus allowing him to keep the property for the lower payment.

Harmless?  Where do you think the $8.3 million difference is coming from?  Not from the bank.  It's the reason all us common folks are only getting 0.01% on our savings; we are all paying for these financial abuses.  How many retirees had to sell their homes and move in with their kids because their savings no longer produce any income?

In all fairness, Mr. Siegel feels really bad about the transaction, and even says so, but nonetheless takes advantage of these financial loopholes, just as anyone would.  He even proposes that our legislatures close these financial loopholes and reign in the banks.  Good luck getting that done.

If I ever had such wealth, I don't think I would live in such an ostentatious manner.

Anyways, the Siegels strike me as ordinary people living extravagantly. While they might have a great deal of resources, from the film it also seems as if they are living on a lot of credit (aka borrowed money). I really don't have much of an opinion of David and Jackie Siegel, though I find David's hardcore support of Republicans and Bush to be rather repelling.

I viewed this DVD the day after the Sandy Hook shootings. Previously I had a vague sense that harm to another occurred as part of an impulsive outburst, a tantrum. Somebody standing too nearby is accidentally hit when emotions spin out of control like a blender without a lid. Then we reflect on the damage to our own self regard, accept accountability, apologize, make amends, promise to never repeat the action and make the choice to exercise restraint and personal discipline to alter future behavior. Life is cumulative, it is the work of a lifetime to counteract genetic intuition and impulse with consciously chosen unfamiliar life skills.

In the Sandy Hook event a man chose to shoot each individual multiple times, intentionally focusing hostility repeatedly, not randomly venting. That someone would consciously injure implies malevolence I had not previously considered. Yes I am aware of German Nazis, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, but evil and malice did not fully concretize for me until Sandy Hook. And the next day the Queen of Versailles DVD, displaying a more subtle, socially more damaging impact on individual character and ultimately national character.

Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent. Carl Jung

Queen of Versailles documents parenting which eliminated whatever gratitude the adolescent Jonquil had, despite her own parents' neglect, paternal estrangement then her mother's death. And introduced ego (extroverts using others as audience), materialism (""make sure no one leaves here today without buying something""), pride (Mrs Florida 1995 host to Miss America contestants), sloth (dog poop, clothes, litter, toilet cleaning, meals, transportation left for housekeeper, cook, McDonalds, drivers, private jet pilot), entitlement (the first time the 4 year old flies commercially instead of in their private jet: what are all these people doing on our plane?), self pity (""I'm on a budget, what is the name of my driver?"" at the airport car rental), vanity (plastic surgery despite husband's distress about finances: I'm at the doctor's), Fantasyland (Disney fireworks displace reality), arrogance (""because I can""), sentimentality (honor dead dogs ""so important"" while neglecting to water and feed living pets who die on camera, whining ""no one drove me to the pet store"" ""it's not my pet""), unwillingness to be responsible (""it's not my fault, I didn't do it"").

There is a dichotomy between Western and Asian cultures: in the US male suicides are 4x that of females, whereas throughout Asia female suicides equal or exceed male suicide (SCIENCE American Association for the Advancement of Science Vol338 23Nov2012 p1025-1027 Making Sense of a Senseless Act). In the West suicide is attributed to mental illness. In Asia suicide results from failing in one's duty to serve the family (honoring ancestors, filial piety, financial responsibility).

American men die younger, women survive to old age, 60% in poverty. This 2 year documentary follows the toll of financial stress on 74yo Mr Siegel, as 43yo Mrs Siegel continues shopping and plastic surgery. She indulges in multiple pregnancies when she realizes nannies can do the work of raising children.

If we assume responsibility for our own choices, cook for ourselves, clean up after our own litter, toilets and offenses, we experience the moral texture of reality, secure in a sense of who we are without needing adulation or an audience. On the other hand if we offload the obligation to clean up our messes on to others, it is possible we may not know who we are, or what the meaning of our life is. Expecting others to be responsible for taking care of us, making us happy, or providing the money for our buying excesses, is a crusher of optimistic self regard and belief in self efficacy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Jasmine-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B00G7QPYX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Jasmine (+UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>]

In Myanmar a woman carries two 5 gallon water cans, one in each hand, a load of firewood on her back, and a baby in a carrier on her front. Hilltribe women work the fields, squat to deliver babies, strap the baby on their back and continue working the field. Or walk for miles to village to sell backstrap loom handwoven silk and embroidered textiles, vegetables, chickens. Asian women carry a sense of duty for the financial stability of the family, saving to purchase water buffalo, pig, chickens. The Japanese economy rises and falls with the frugality of the Japanese housewife. Women bear the responsibility to save and provide for the future.

In prosperity caution, in sunshine carry an umbrella. Confucius

The false idea that identity is permanently bound to objects (money, house, gun) leads to fragility insecurity and vulnerability (Siegel's oldest son ""just this week I asked my dad for money, I need money, you have to give me money""). The only individual interested in developing the moral and intellectual competence of the Siegel children is the Asian nanny (""why do you have detention?"" [ASIN:1594202842 Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]).

The ethical erosion of integrity in children raised without self awareness may be difficult to reverse. As adults the Siegel children may choose to risk growth, maturity beyond self indulgence but evolution requires effort, hard work, looking to the hand at the end of one's arm to effect change. Giving up luxuries like bottled water, yoga classes, self pitying compulsions (emotional manipulation, helplessness, entitlement, shopping, botox, dermabrasion, plastic surgery body sculpting) to build moral muscle and self regard requires a conscious decision: devotion of energy and effort to responsibility, personal discipline and self management (mental physical emotional spiritual social financial).

Both Siegels appear unwilling to accept a parental duty to grow themselves up and role model discretion restraint and wise adult behavior for their children. Their generous decision to allow filming to continue after the 2008 Great Recession permits us a window into decision making perhaps different from our own.

One-percenters' impact on our national vision of what is desirable in parenting may benefit from detailed scrutiny. We respect the right of others to make decisions different from our own without offensively proselytizing to persuade others our way (religion, nationality, ethnicity, culture, parenting, politics, way of folding wontons) is better. Each person is different, with a different favorite color and way of seeing the world. However, contaminating the moral inclination of children by spoiling requires reasoned contemplation. How attractive is spoiled meat? spoiled fruit? spoiled humans? Having children raised by nannies, or having children as an excuse to not work certainly raises thought provoking questions&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parenthood-Special-Edition/dp/B000MRNWK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parenthood (Special Edition)</a>.

Is there value in honest struggling with our imperfect humanity, trying to work harder at chipping off our shared rough character edges (sloth gossip greed vanity condescension self pity)?

Learning to express anger through discretion compassion and withdrawal rather than to arrogantly impose one's beliefs on others is not often brought so vividly to attention except in the remarkable situation of documentary filming. Reluctance to make the effort to self examine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Using-the-Wisdom-of-Your-Body-and-Mind-to-Face-Stress-Pain-and-Illness/dp/0385303122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness</a>&nbsp;allows parental confusion to contaminate children who then become unsure of themselves. Adults bear a duty to inspect personal attitudes, thoughts and actions, not unkindly, yet honestly.

Who will provide elderly caregiving for the aging 74yo Mr Siegel? will 43yo Mrs Siegel? any of her 8 children? any of his 13 children? what moral muscle will the children call on to make the necessary sacrifices? will they make the effort?

There is a big Ick factor on almost every level, from the entitled, not so nice  David Siegle sitting shirtless in his office, snapping at his wife and kids to the kids who let caged pets starve with no real apparent remorse.  I found the interview by the older son from the first wife tragic- how he picked wild plants to help feed his mom and siblings while his millionaire father moved onto his second wife who wanted nothing to do with the first family children. Ironic that he is the one standing by his father as his empire crumbles.

This documents a family who has no clue how to function in reduced circumstances, which is understandable given that the husband and wife team were so confident in their place in the world that they were building the biggest house in America, based on Versailles- possibly the biggest show of self importance possible.

The release is timely given the recent election and David Siegel being one of the CEO's threatening to fire people if Obama won the election.  He also takes credit for delivering Florida to Bush although he will not say how since it might not be legal in his words.

Overall, it's a documentary about looking in and seeing a familiar scene- a family struggling and somewhat falling apart due to circumstances they did not see coming who are unable to cope with their new reality.",1355011200,7,1528,4.619926199261992
5277313,4,B0097RU2LO,"More than the ""QUEEN of Versailles"" this fascinating documentary could best be titled ""The FAMILY of Versailles"" since there is almost as much time spent with the ""Time Share King"", David Siegel, as with his ""trophy wife"" Jackie. And then there are the eight kids, who mostly act like spoiled brats.

There are lots of other reviews already posted here but most are based on the theatrical version. I hope to provide a few comments on the film itself and also discuss the DVD and Bluray discs.

This 100-minute documentary wins on a number of levels. The first part - when the Siegels are at the top of their rich lifestyle, building a 90,000 square foot mansion (with 32 bathrooms!) to replace their ""lowly"" 26,000 square foot home (with ONLY 17 bathrooms) - shows you how the rich live and have power. (Just listen as Siegel tells you that it was HE who got George W. Bush elected President.) When documentarian Lauren Greenfield began this project she was making a film about the rich. Then things change and the financial crash of 2008 occurred. Greenfield stuck with the project and the film turned direction. Now the family had to downsize - a LOT. And Greenfield was there to capture it.

Of course the centerpiece of the film is Jackie - the mid-40s woman who grew up in a middle class house in Binghamton, NY and became a beauty queen. When she met Siegel (after both had failed marriages) she became his trophy wife. Siegel, who owned the largest time-share company in America, likes things BIG. He builds the largest homes, the largest time shares and - based on the archival footage of Jackie in Her beauty pageant days - he must have encouraged her to have breast enlargement surgery because this lady makes Dolly Parton's chest look normal!

While the comments from Jackie and their children might make you laugh, those from both Siegel and his son from the first marriage provide a lesson in business management and sales. And if you don't shed a tear when the Filipino ""nanny"" is on camera I'll be surprised.

The DVD and Bluray each have the same ""Bonuses"". In addition to the Theatrical Trailer there are eight ""deleted scenes"", totaling 22 minutes. While we are never told why Greenfield chose not to include the scenes (a Director's commentary on them would have been nice), they do add to knowing more about the Siegels and are well worth watching. One shows a ""day at the Spa"" with Jackie getting her body tanned and then seeing ""Aunt Sue"" arrive. Sue - who I don't remember seeing in the film - is an amputee (with a Louis Vuitton replacement leg! - really). Another shows Jackie returning to the diner in Binghamton where she was a waitress when she was 17. The most fascinating (to me at least) deleted scene has virtually nothing to do with the Siegel's life. It shows how Westgate Resorts (the time share company) would entice ""average folk"" to buy a time share/ This short video will be quite educational to those who might be enticed by time share offerings.

What I really found lacking in the DVD package was a Director's commentary by filmmaker Greenfield. This film calls out for one. How did she find the Siegels and what was HER impression of their lifestyle? We hear her ask a few questions on screen during the film but there had to be more. The DVD was an opportunity missed.

So yes, I highly recommend the film as an eye-opener on a world most of us will never know. And, if you saw the film in a theater and liked it, the 23 minutes of deleted scenes will add to that enjoyment. The film ends with the Siegels still in their ""smaller"" house and only the Las Vegas timeshare sold. Wouldn't it be great if Greenfield updated the DVD release in a few years so we can see how the kids (especially the teenagers) turned out and whether Jackie still has her ""stuff"" stored away?

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5277347,5,B0097RU2LO,"""The Queen of Versailles"" is a documentary that follows magnate David Siegel and wife Jackie as they set about building the largest private residence in America, patterned after the Palace of Versailles.

Jackie is a 43-year-old former beauty queen with an engineering background. David, 74, is the father of her seven children and the founder, president, and chief executive of Westgate Resorts, at the time the largest privately owned time-share enterprise in the world. Unhappy with their 26,000-square-foot home, the Siegels begin upgrading to a 90,000-square-foot mansion with ten kitchens, more than 30 baths, and a closet bigger than many homes' master bedrooms.  Then the 2008 financial crisis hit.

Photographer and documentary director Lauren Greenfield struck gold with the downturn in the economy and the Siegels' fortunes. The Siegels allowed her to continue filming as the story changed from a rich couple building an impossibly huge mansion to that same couple adjusting their luxurious lifestyle to the realities of a sinking economy.

""The Queen of Versailles"" is available in Blu-ray and DVD formats.",1351987200,6,1118,5.445086705202312

Their 26,000 sq ft house is too small, so they are building a 90,000 sq ft one, based on the palace at Versailles. That's what the documentary starts out about. Then, the economic collapse hits, and actually affects them so they must cease construction on this huge palace and fire 19 of their 24 or so household staff. There is still money for a non-surgical facelift for the forty-something wife with basketball-size false boobs married to the 75 yr old husband with enormous gut, but they must forgo private planes with their 7 kids and niece. This movie was a horror show of what happens to people when they simply have too much money. There is no compassion for the Filipino nanny who has not seen her own children in 11 years. There is no feeling for pets, even, who are allowed to crap all over the floor (dogs) or simply allowed to die (reptiles, fish) from neglect. This is how the next generation of monsters is made: give kids so much that they have absolutely no compassion for anyone or anything -- because if they do not sometimes do without, they lack sympathy for those who do without on a regular basis. That this behavior can be learned is shown by the adopted niece, who grew up in a less-privileged environment, but who allows her pet to die of hunger and thirst and then says, with 16 yr old attitude, I'm sorry I'm such a horrible person. Why yes, honey, that is one definition. Anyone who lets helpless, dependent animals die a horrible death from sheer laziness is exactly that. And this is the one who should have known better. This movie is a horror show, and if anything explains why we should limit vast accumulations of wealth when others are suffering. Certainly, the super-rich will not limit themselves. The husband crows that he was the one who got W elected, then demurs from explaining, as it ""was probably not legal."" No, it was probably treason, and yes, the Iraq war and its casualties resulted. You would have to look far and wide to find a less sympathetic subject for a documentary, a man so focused on money he doesn't care for his wife, his kids or his countrymen. One interesting point, early on in the movie, Siegel says proudly that Donald Trump complained about the sign from his Las Vegas tower -- it was shining into the Donald's penthouse. Later, when the building is lost to bankruptcy, the light is turned off. Are we supposed to believe that the Donald had something to do with that? This is what occupies the minds of billionaires? Not global warming or global hunger, but how to control every aspect of their immediate surroundings, to the extent of influencing banks to push for a bankruptcy so a light can be turned off?

""The Queen of Versailles,"" a new documentary by Lauren Greenfield about life on the thin, fragile, sugarcoated top layer of the upper crust, captures the tone of the times with a clear, surprisingly compassionate eye. A gaudy guilty pleasure that is also a piece of trenchant social criticism, the movie starts out in the mode of reality television, resembling the pilot for a new ""Real Housewives"" franchise or a reboot of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."" Before long, though, it takes on the coloration of a Theodore Dreiser novel -- not quite an American tragedy but a sprawling, richly detailed study of ambition, desire and the wild swings of fortune that are included in the price of the capitalist ticket. -- A.

5277351,4,B0097RU2LO,"The premise of ""The Queen of Versailles"" (100 mim.) is well-known by now: David Siegel, king of the time share industry, and his wife Jackie are building a 90,000 sq. ft. dream house to end all dream houses near Orlando, intended to surplant their current house of a mere 26,000 sq. ft. Alas, then the financial crisis arrived and with cheap money no longer available, the Siegels are fighting to keep their dream house alive.

Director Lauren Greenfield spent about 3 years working on this movie, pretty much moving in with the Siegels (the couple of 8 children, of which 1 is adopted) and being a fly on the wall. Before I saw the movie a few days ago at a theatre here in Cincinnati, I expected to be either outraged at the absurdity of it all, and/or dismayed/annoyed. But I was none of those. In fact, the movie showcases the humble roots of both David and Jackie, and there are some hilarious (but for the fact that they are real, and hence rather sad) scenes in the movie when you see the Siegels struggling with everyday issues. In fact, in that sense the movie reminded me very much of the MVT reality show ""The Ozbournes"". In the end, this movie shows us the plainness of the filthy rich, who get up in the morning just like you and me. (As a side note, when this movie was first released at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, David Siegel brought a law suit against Lauren Greenfield, accusing her of painting a false picture of Siegel's overall financial situation. I'm not sure what has become of that law suit.)

That said, this movie is for me a missed opportunity to go into much more detail about the financial issues that surround David Spiegel and his business empire. Yes, there are some scenes that touch on it, but it is far too superficial to turn this into a financial real-life thriller, as it could've been. Rather than ""The Queen of Versailles"", the movie should've been made into ""The King of Versailles"". In the end, ""The Queen of Versailles"" is not a bad movie perse, not at all. But it could've been so much better!",1346198400,3,2057,4.512064343163539
5277352,5,B0097RU2LO,"Lauren Greenfield's ""The Queen of Versailles"" is funny, sad, appalling and touching all at once. It can be taken as a tale of wretched excess, of the implosion of the American Dream. or as proof that the rich (at least the nouveaux riches) are perhaps not so different from you and me.

""The Queen of Versailles"" is a documentary about David and Jacqueline Siegel, Florida billionaires who made a mint in the time-share boom of the early 2000s, only to go bust when the subprime mortgage bubble burst. The symbol of their rags-to-riches-to-rags story is their unfinished 90,000-square-foot house, named and modeled after Versailles, which they are forced to put on the market. The early portion of the film depicts the Siegels' life of childish self-congratulation in their current 26,000-sq.-ft. mansion, replete with gilt thrones, shoe closets the size of airplane hangars, and portraits of themselves in royal robes. The later footage shows their lives falling into chaos. David becomes increasingly grumpy and withdrawn; Jackie continues her shopping sprees (only at discount stores rather than Neiman-Marcus), and finds it impossible to cope with her eight unruly children and pack of un-housebroken American Eskimo dogs with a severely depleted household staff. And all the while Versailles sits gathering spiderwebs, while the bank schemes to put it into foreclosure.

More than one critic has pointed out the irony of the Siegels suffering the same fate, albeit on a larger scale, as their time-share clients. Yet as Greenfield portrays them--in remarkably unguarded scenes culled from more than 200 hours of film--the Siegels aren't unlikable. To be sure, they have character flaws magnified first by their wealth, then the loss of their wealth. But David Siegel is no worse than most other guys obsessed with their businesses, and Jackie obviously has a heart at least as big as her braless breasts. David and Jackie are by no means stupid or unfeeling people; they are human like us. (David, 74 when filming begins, looks maybe 60; two years later, he's 76 and looks every year of it.)

There is much here that is poignant, particularly in sequences involving the Siegels' longtime nanny and Jackie's old high school friend. If we fell into money, we might be more tasteful and less wasteful than the Siegels in spending it. But though we might chuckle at specific things they do, we can't say we would always be wiser than they were.",1345939200,114,2445,5.062034739454094
5277353,3,B0097RU2LO,"I just saw THE QUEEN OF VERSAILLES and cannot get it out of my head, so it's got that going for it. It is well edited and decently shot, though I think the final scene was not white balanced, so it was quite jarring to see the film's payoff sequence look so different from the previous hour and a half. Production quibbles aside, QUEEN is a riches-to-rags story where David Siegel, ""Time Share"" king of Central Florida, and his third wife, the blonde Jackie Siegel, are building a dream home, which when completed will be America's biggest. Despite some truly humanizing moments in this film where Mr. and Mrs. Siegel grapple with the fact that they could lose everything due to the 2008 financial crisis, it's hard not to see them as profoundly vulgar and selfish people who are not only victims of their own greed, but people whose greed has wreaked havoc and hardship on other people's lives. At one point in the film you come to find that if Mr. Siegel would just sell a prized building on the Vegas strip he could likely erase his debts and (presumably) re-hire thousands of people he's laid off, which includes people who spent years raising his own children. He doesn't do that. Instead he digs in with resolve to save a neon skyscraper ... The worst part of this all is that the filmmaker frames this event as some sort of demonstration of manly, foolish pride when even the most shallow analysis would lead most people to see Siegel's behavior as irresponsible and destructive to an extreme. Why the filmmaker chooses to simply skate past this fact must have been a creative and narrative decision because it is certainly not a moral one. As time went on in my watching this I found myself less entertained and more and more uncomfortable with what this film stands for ... if it stands for anything at all ...",1344211200,18,1819,4.58282208588957

Poor kids. The 90,000 sq. ft. Versailles was under construction when the bottom dropped out of the real estate market, so they had to halt construction on that and make do in their 26,000 sq. ft. house. The story only gets more crazy from there on out. I had told my friend who went with me that this movie was a documentary, but afterwards she asked if those were actors and actresses and was it a true story, because she couldn't conceive that there were real people on the planet who would act that way intentionally.

This film was about his struggle in building and keeping a 90,000 sq. ft. mansion-resort estate.  He put in about $38 millions and borrowed from banks about 40 millions.  Their dream house design was Versailles, French style.  They meant to list it at least $100 millions after renovation.
Camera work showed pictures of David's supporting George Bush for President in 2001, in-house puppies and wow, a pet tiger.  Their teenage
children and servants running around.  An extended limousine driving through a gate.  No security guard there.  Possibly near foreclosure at time of making this film in 2012.  Jacqueline Siegel was still praying for a turnaround miracle.
Here came in Year 2008.  Economic Crisis.  Many people lost their money, houses and even lives.  As for David, his condo sales in Nevada braked to a full stop.  He had a cash flow problem instantly.  In the meanwhile, their dream home was only half done.  Monthly request for payments from building contractor and banker never stopped.  David as family-head, put this unfinished project for sale at $75 millions.  No deal
straight for 7 months.  Foreclosure became a reality.  The whole family with nanny moved out to a rental big house.  Children had to switch attending public schools.  And in 2011, David had to sell all his realty interest in the WestGate Tower, NV.  In 2012, he was constantly thinking
of ways to borrow money to survive and to revive.  Good luck.",1482969600,3,1998,4.825443786982248
