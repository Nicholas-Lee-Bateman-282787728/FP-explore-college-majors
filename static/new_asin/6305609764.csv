1051278,5,6305609764,Great one of the best (if not the best) Christmas movies ever. A humourous take on the Charles Dickens classic with great special effects. If you don't get this movie for Christmas it won't be as merry.,946252800,2,202,4.486486486486487

My friends and I quote Scrooged all the time. My favorite  quote, ""All day long I have to listen to excuses why people can't  work. My back aches. My legs hurt. I'm only 4.""

1051280,5,6305609764,"Since the first time I ever saw this movie, I have watched it a few times a year, never tiring of the modern take on the Dickens classic.  Bill Murray is excellently cast as cold hearted TV exec Frank Cross and with  each scene, the movie draws you ever-closer to the Christmas feeling.
I  watch this EVERY Christmas Eve and no matter how bad a year you've had, by  the time this movie finishes and it's time to go to bed before Father  Christmas comes, you'll be in the true Spirit of the Season.
I've yet to  meet someone who doesn't lean towards this as their movie of choice for the  festive period.  And now... I finally get to see it on DVD!",943488000,62,647,4.203252032520325

1051484,3,6305609764,This is a good movie.  It's an updated modern day version of A Christmas Carol.  I think this is one of Bill Murray's best roles.  Along with What About Bob.  And Carol Kane is excellent.  If you didn't know.  The scene where they are standing outside the door.  Watching them play Trivial Pursuit.

1051605,3,6305609764,"I enjoy Christmas movies, but I admit that sometimes they can be a little TOO cheesy and saccharine.  For those who can't stand the often-syrupy-sweet corniness of traditional Christmas films, ""Scrooged"" might be the perfect antidote.  Yes, it's based on the oft-repeated story of ""A Christmas Carol,"" which has been adapted and parodied so many times that even those who have never read the original can predict every beat of the plot.  But this version, starring Bill Murray as a slimeball television executive, is not only surprisingly dark, but downright hilarious, and isn't afraid to veer into the macabre and poke fun at its own story as it goes.

Murray stars as Frank Cross, a cynical and heartless TV executive put in charge of planning and filming a live adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic ""Christmas Carol,"" while at the same time firing an employee for disagreeing with him, overworking his exhausted secretary, and trying to forget both his ex-girlfriend and his well-meaning brother.  Naturally, being the Scrooge that he is, he's visited by his extremely-dead former boss, who tells him he'll be visited by three ghosts who will show him the error of his ways.  Frank knows the story by heart, of course, and is sure he knows what to expect -- but the ghosts have other ideas.  And as Frank is unceremoniously dragged through time by a smart-mouthed cabbie who happens to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, slapped and kicked around by the chipper yet violent Ghost of Christmas Present, and terrorized by an eldritch abomination of the Ghost of Christmas Future, he just might learn a few things about himself and his actions along the way... if the ghosts aren't the end of him before then.

I confess that this is not my favorite Christmas film.  It's hilarious, but pretty dark and even gruesome in a few parts.  Bill Murray hams it up a LOT, chewing the scenery with gusto, and is so over-the-top jerkish that it ceases to be very believable -- he's more a caricature than an actual character.  And quite a few scenes are capable of giving those just wanting a heartwarming Christmas film nightmares -- Frank's shocking TV promo for the ""Christmas Carol"" special shows us right off the bat that this isn't going to be your typical Dickens' tale, and the decaying Bob Marley stand-in, the nightmarish Ghost of Christmas Future, and the corpse of someone who's literally frozen to death don't exactly lighten things up much.  And a few scenes that were shocking enough in the '80s are difficult to watch today, such as an ex-employee shooting up a workplace.

On the other hand... despite the grimness, this film IS funny, and a nice antidote to the sugary sweetness of many Christmas films.  It's also a nice reminder that the original ""Christmas Carol"" WAS fairly grim, dealing with terrifying ghosts and the depressing realities that many less-fortunate people have to go through in life.  Many remakes of ""Christmas Carol"" tend to tone this down, but ""Scrooged"" instead one-ups them wherever it can.  And let's face it, making Frank an over-the-top jerk just makes it all the more satisfying when the ghosts smack him down and put him in his place.  Plus, it's Bill Murray.  No matter how big of a jerk he plays, he can make them hilarious... and even slightly sympathetic.

Definitely not for all tastes, ""Scrooged"" is still a startlingly dark but sidesplittingly hilarious Christmas film.  It's a nice change of pace for people tired of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" and gives a classic story its own twisted yet enjoyable brand of humor.  Definitely not for kids, but the adults will sure enjoy this one once the kiddies have gone to bed on Christmas Eve...",1515628800,,3707,4.84310618066561

She did a great job and the movie became alive during those scenes.  Everything else just kind of frumped along.  Bill Murray seemed half interested.

1051680,4,6305609764,"The best modern-day adaptation of A Christmas Carol. It makes wonderful use of Murrays curmudgeon side  also seen a few years later in the not-dissimilar Groundhog Day  and a host of lesser players, including Carol Kane (in a grand turn as the Ghost of Christmas Present), David Johansen (ditto for Christmas Past), Bobcat Goldthwait and Karen Allen.

It does need a bit of editing. Alas, the end sequence goes on too long and the vibe winds up enforcedly joyful. And I wish the creators had somehow contrived to keep the shotgun out of the control room. It reminds us that, for all the rampant good feeling on display down on the sound stage, the technical folks upstairs are still being held at gunpoint.

Maybe it's expectations. For those who say it's not a literal version of Dicken's story, well, it's not. It's inspired and loosely based on it. Many people complain that the character is too dark or that they can't like him enough to root for him. But this is not It's a Wonderful Life and Bill Murray isn't Jimmy Stewart. I don't think anyone watching any of the actual films of A Christmas Carol or even reading the story would say they could relate to Scrooge or see any hope for him. Scrooge is a dark character, so far it would seem from any hope of redemption that when it comes it's all the more joyful.

Secondly, Scrooged is basically a farce and so by its very nature everything has to be over the top. That's how a farce works. If Bill Murray's character had been a mildly grumpy man it would have fallen flat. Everything is exaggerated to its maximum effect. Bill Murray's Frank Cross isn't bad, he's horrible. As the movie begins he does something awful, then he does something even worse, then he tops even that, totally plumbing the depths of being an unprincipled scoundrel. There's seemingly no limit to how awful Frank Cross can be. And Bill Murray was the perfect actor in the role. It's the summation of the cynical, smug character that Bill Murray had developed over the years. He plays it beautifully, too: no winks at the camera, just totally straight as the boss from hell. It's his film, he had to carry it and he did so, perfectly.

The film by Richard Donner, a director known for action films was shot between Lethal Weapon I and II. It knocks you out of any preconceived expectations by opening with an armed invasion of Santa's Workshop at the North Pole (The Day the Reindeer Died) featuring an actual action star then goes off in several other unexpected directions until you don't know what will happen next and that's the general way the whole film is. It's also loaded with unexpected casting and surprise cameos which are all part of the fun. Some of this may have lost some effect as time has gone by and new viewers may not understand some of the references, but it's still a funny film even if you don't know who all the actors are. It also satirizes the notion that any publicity is good publicity, industry awards and the quest for network ratings. The supporting cast is excellent, even Murray's younger brother playing Frank Cross's younger brother. If you like Bill Murray, you'll love it.",1512691200,3,2592,4.620390455531453

The setup of Bill Murray's character is not bad but after that the movie falls flat. I managed to sit through it all so I'll give it 2 stars. One could do worse - ""Comedian"" by Jerry Seinfeld is completely unwatchable and I'd have no hesitation giving it 1 star despite being a fan of the TV show. I generally like Bill Murray too but this one's a dud",1482537600,,500,4.0606060606060606

While others are watching White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, I'm curled up with Bill Murray and his crazy, cruel, hilarious take on Scrooge. I watch this every Christmas, along with Christmas Vacation, The Ref and A Christmas story.  But, I'm a huge Bill Murray fan and this movies has lots of stars I love. Carol Kane was perfect for her role in this movie. He's also very loyal to his brothers. They all have roles in this, even if they are just small roles. Bobcat Goldthwait is hilarious as the abused and wrongly fired employee. If you haven't seen this, you're missing out on Bill Murray at his comedic best.",1478304000,2,674,4.570247933884297

Christmas is reduced to a night of happiness and goodness. The tripe is hard to swallow because Murray does not act, he is himself. Not even his stupid smile saves this dreck of a movie.

1053661,5,6305609764,"""Scrooged"" is one of my favorite Christmas movies. Of course, Bill Murray has a lot to do with that. I love his style of acting and comedy-""Groundhog Day"" is another of my faves. ""Scrooged"" is a modern take on ""A Christmas Carol"" with Murray playing the part of a TV executive who is in the process of putting on a live production of ""A Christmas Carol"". As you may expect, he is narcissistic, and quite unpleasant to people around him, so he is visited by three ghosts with decidedly their own takes on being the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. A great Christmas comedy that I highly recommend!",1454544000,,611,4.5636363636363635

Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is a fairly nasty pice of work but lacks the fusty meanness of the real scrooge. The ghosts aren't bad and there are some laugh out loud moments.

1054114,2,6305609764,"Bill Murraya seemingly perfect choice for an Ebenezer Scrooge character in a film set in a contemporary period.  Seemingly would have been actually if he had a better script and better direction helping him.  In this movie, hes a TV executive who goes for raunchiness and doesnt care about anyone else.  He gets visited by the ghost of his colleague and 3 spirits, but though there are some interesting imaginative ideas with how to adapt the Christmas Carol story, they never work too well in this movie, for reasons I will give below.  What makes a comedy a trainwreck?  I think its when it becomes embarrassing to watch to the point of making me aghast, asking What am I watching? in shock.  People complain about Nicolas Cage and Christopher Walken going overboard with emotionally excessive, unbalanced performances in dramas.  Bill Murray and Will Ferrell can be just as bad in the comedy realm, and I don't hear enough people complaining about excessive comedies.  There are very few times when getting laughs depends on going to the extreme.  When the main character loses a sense of personality and just becomes a back-and-forth of two or three characteristics, nothing can redeem the comedy.  That is what happens to Bill Murrays acting in this movie.  In my opinion, its because he didn't have the tempering hand of Harold Ramis to guide him on his comedic style in this movie.  Even though the movie Groundhog Day led to the end of their working relationship (due primarily to Murrays personal problems but also strong opinions which conflicted with Ramiss), Ramis made sure the movie Groundhog Day didn't go to the extreme in the sadness or lightheartedness or in any of Bill Murrays potential moods.  On the contrary, due to the writing and directing choices in Scrooged, Bill Murray does nothing but turn on a certain emotional reaction at any given moment, so that his character has no depth, just 3 basic moods:  a lot of yelling, smugness when other people suffer if they caused him inconvenience, or fearful reactions.  He doesnt even have the romantic charm in this movie at the moments he needs it, because hes already made his character such a loudmouth that it becomes impossible to take him seriously as a potential love interest.  His character has no arc/trajectory, not even much of one at the end.  What I mean is that the STORY wants you to believe what you're watching as he woos a lady played by Karen Allen (best known for playing Indiana Joness love interest), but his acting is so cartoonish that its impossible for me to be invested in it.

I have no idea why the Ghost of Christmas Past is an unsavory character or the Ghost of Christmas Present keeps whacking Bill Murrays character in the head and laughing at him.  There are a lot of other distasteful choices, most of which are not BLATANTLY sexual, but which are more like Seth MacFarlane kind of humor with people getting hurt or insulting each other in ways which lack the cleverness or sensitivity of good comedy.  Have him insult this guy; thisll be funny.  Have him knock this lady over; thisll be funny.  Have her kick his sensitive area; thisll be funny.  Physical comedy usually works only in the context of something true to life, somehow relatable.

It may sound like Im trying to create rules out of comedy when comedy is totally subjective, but I don't think comedy is totally subjective.  It should be obvious that whenever something is overused, it ceases to be funny, and that applies to Murrays acting in this.  His reactions are constantly emotionally overboard, and the difference between watching him in this and in his better movies such as Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters is as great as the difference between watching Andy Griffith play the loudmouth, mean-spirited country singer-turned-TV-star Lonesome Rhodes (in A Face in the Crowd) and his beloved sheriff character on The Andy Griffith Show.  Its great acting in the sense that the actor exerts a lot, but its a very distasteful viewing experience.  Murray steals the attention because he is so extreme throughout this movie, and if acting was just about exerting emotions, he is fine, but he is a very insensitive actor in this movie, by not letting his character have a trajectory/arc or deeper personality.

There are other bizarre things in this movie which make me wonder if it was just trying too hard to be different.  The guy Bill Murray fires for giving him a suggestion goes crazy and starts later trying to shoot Murrays character with a shotgun, another thing which contributes nothing funny and just makes me ask What am I watching?  The equivalent of Tiny Tim, who is emotionally locked up to the point hes unable to speak, opens up suddenly from seeing Bill Murray change, but its not very believable to me.  Robert Mitchum, in one of his last roles, is underused and poorly used, because he presents a threat to Murrays characters career, in that he brings someone from Los Angeles to help Murray (in New York), who is likely going to replace Murray, but later it doesnt really make sense:  Mitchum wants to get rid of Murray, but suddenly starts to fall for the Christmas charm Murray puts on the TV broadcast, and the sudden change of mood felt so phony to me.  Additionally, when Murray changes at the end, hes scared into submission by the equivalent of the fear of hell, but the effectiveness of the real story by Dickens is that its not so blatant/overt in making you think about what happens after death; thats a component, but the consequences of our choices in THIS life are more of the emphasis.

Youd have to see it to fully understand what Im describing about how this comedy is a disaster, but I would advise against it.  There are much better ways to enjoy Bill Murray on screenmost of all Groundhog Day.",1452297600,2,5802,4.7554890219560875

1054258,2,6305609764,"""Scrooged"" is another misanthropic ""Anti-Christmas Christmas Movie"" heralded as some sort of modern classic. It's a half-baked attempt at a Ghostbusters/Beetlejuice/Christmas Carol hybrid.

The script is a mess and Bill Murray seems to have been given free range to improvise (especially for the long, embarrassingly unfunny and ironically uninspiring ""inspirational speech"" at the end).

This cynical and dreadful film is filled with gross out humor and cheap physical comedy (think crotch kicks and rotten body parts).

Bill Murray and Karen Allen lack any screen chemistry during their ""romantic"" scenes, which like everything else in the film, somehow manage to seem too forced and half hearted at the same time.

""Scrooge"" (1951) is a superior blend of dark humor, horror, and sentimentalism; watch it and compare.  It's no wonder Bill Murray tired of doing cheesy comedies; they haven't aged well. He was smart to move on.",1451174400,3,928,5.372413793103449

I does a very good job of putting this story into a modern perspective with a dash of humor mixed in with a fare amount of tragedy but I don't think that todays prudish politically correct and sensitive audience can handle this type of entertainment anymore. You will see what I mean when you watch it. Everything from its treatment of terrorism in the media in the opening shots to a violent revenge seeking employee. We have seen too much of the real thing for this to be entertaining anymore. It will make you cringe today whereas in its day it didn't phase people.

1054472,3,6305609764,"This Bill Murray movie has an interesting premise and story line based VERY loosely on the events of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" Billy Murray plays Frank Cross, a mean-spirited studio honcho who is putting together a questionable Christmas special. He is visited by the three Ghosts of Christmas, and Frank changes heart by the end of the movie and the spirit of his special.

I loved the ensemble of the classic actors -- John Forsyth playing the ghost of Lew Hayword, Frank's dead mentor; Robert Mitchum as Preston Rhinelander, Frank's boss; Karen Allen as Claire Phillips, Frank's romantic interest and untainted conscience; Buddy Hackett as Ebenezer Scrooge in the network Christmas special; Jamie Farr as Jacob Marley in the network Christmas special; Lee Majors as himself in a cameo role of the movie within a movie ""The Night the Reindeer Died""; and John Houseman as himself narrating the network Christmas special.

Excellent quirky performances delivered by John Forsyth, Carol Kane as Ghost of Christmas Present, and Bobcat Goldthwait as the fired assistant Eliot Loudermilk.  But David Johansen steals the show as the cabby Ghost of Christmas Past.

I gave this movie only a 3-star. Although Bill Murray provides a couple of above average outbursts reminiscent of some of his classic work in Caddyshack, Stripes, and Ghostbusters, the material is too coarse for kids, and I would not add this to my annual holiday viewing fare.

Finally, there is not enough good material for this movie to stand on its own as a Bill Murray classic, or earn a place on my repeat viewing list. Watch it once to say you have, then sell or give the DVD to someone else.",1447545600,,1671,4.932384341637011

1054684,5,6305609764,"Scrooged is probably one of the least known of the great Christmas movies, but if you have never seen it, it is absolutely worth watching. It's a modern-day retelling of ""A Christmas Carol"" and, in many ways, is among the best film versions of that story. First if all, it has a lot of humor, and I think Dickens would enjoy seeing his tale told with a lot of laughs. Also, Bill Murray is a fantastic actor and he really pulls off the Scrooge character (in the guise of a modern-day TV producer who puts profits ahead of things like, oh, his own life). Carol Cane is wonderful, she's so funny, and Buster Poindexter (aka David Johansen) is superb. Great. He doesn't make enough films.

There is almost nothing negative to say about this film, it's a vastly underrated film. And, for jazz fans, if you look closely, you'll catch Miles Davis as a street musician in NYC. Great touch.",1435622400,5,881,4.50625

Bobcat Goldthwait does a great job as the fired and disgruntled employee.  Bill Murray is really over the top in this movie and sometimes it's funny, but other times it's just too much.

Murray is at his campy over the top best, and the supporting acting is great. Lead by the hilarious Bobcat Goldthwaite, and including Robert Mitchum, John Forsythe, Carol Kane, David Johansson, Alfre Woodard, Michael Pollard, and even SNL heavyweight Michael O'Donoghue, this is a seriously funny send up of the original.

I liked this movie for its humorous, and some hilarious, take on the stresses of the holiday season. We may want it to be candy canes and holly but, this is not always true. This movie takes these difficulties and really grinds it in. Ah, but, there is a love story here too. And, being a (ahem) Christmas movie, there is a happy ending.

It's a fun play on Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" wherein Bill Murray, a heartless Television exec, is visited by 3 ghosts on Christmas Eve while his television station is broadcasting a live production of... get this... ""A Christmas Carol""! A nice entertaining plot device. Without going too much further into the plot, this movie is a little more adult than most Christmas movies. Its PG-13 rating is well earned. There is some adult language and some adult visuals (no nudity per se but rather the visuals of the ghosts can be rather grim). Regardless, this movie is classic Bill Murray hilarity.

1055374,1,6305609764,"SCROOGED
which is Director Richard Donner's version of Charles Dickens A Christmas carol set during the 80's 1988 to be exact
and Bill murray playing the Lead role
the original DVD release had no special features, just Theatrical trailer like most barebones DVD's have
well SCROOGED is now on blu-ray for the first time from Paramount pictures, again no new special features
i was hopeing for a new retrospective featurette with Richard Donner, Art Linson, Karen Allen or Bill murray at least
or even a new Audio commentary by Richard Donner, but sadly nothing just Theatrical trailer as usual.
Paramount reissued the blu-ray again as steelbook packaging and advertised as Anniversary edition
what Bulls***, it's a big con just to ripoff the fans who love the film
whether you buy the 2011 standard blu-ray case or the 2013 steelbook, they both have the same exact same content
which is no new extras at all, just the usual Theatrical trailer
they have only upgraded the packaging can you believe it Paramount executives are pricks
Paramount did make some effort with the HD transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen,
much more sharper & clearer than the dvd release from years ago
the sound quality has been boosted up aswell a new 5.1 master audio track which obviously sounds better than the dvd
but that's it.
amazon.com are selling this for $8, the blu-ray is only worth $4
1-2 stars i gave it based on no new extras at all, probably best to keep the dvd version
Paramount has given no respect for this classic film, what else is new",1419552000,2,1526,4.7622641509433965

Some scenes may be a bit too intense for younger viewers (the first ""ghost's"" make-up, while extremely realistic could be a bit scary), but it's a hoot for adults.  Not to mention it looks FANTASTIC on Blu-ray!  I wasn't expecting much from a movie that was produced in 1988, but it held up surprisingly well in high-def.  Is it demo-worthy material?

What a fun movie! The script is based on the original Charles Dicken's novel A Christmas Carol and this modern version illustrates the truth of the saying ""you reap what you sow.""

Frank Cross (Scrooge, played by Bill Murray) is reaping the emptiness of a life of ruthless ambition when he is confronted by the decrepit ghost of his deceased boss. Warned that he will soon be confronted by three ghosts, Bill begins to face the truth of his past, present and potential future.

1055911,5,6305609764,"This is a good adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". It may be more of a suggestion than an adaptation.

Bill Murray plays Frank Cross TV executive with a Scrooge type attitude. We all know what is going to happen; yet it is fun to anticipate and see Bill Murray's unique execution of the story.

It is Christmas Eve and are ghosts take Frank Cross across New York City to see what he has done and what he is about to do. The question is, is there any hope for Frank Cross? As we contemplate this we get to listen to Al Green and Annie Lennox sing ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart.""

Other than the message tire not to take this movie to seriously. However I would be very careful if you ever run across the ghost of Christmas present, Carol Kane, or you may find out the real purpose of a wand.

Caution: the film has a gratuitous potty mouth tendency",1410480000,2,866,4.2303030303030305

You or too busy loving him because he is so funny and a joy to watch. He really carries this roll and he was born to drive people completely out of there mines.

Funny, silly, great story line. My son and friend could not believe how great this film was. They wanted to see it because Bill Murray was in it. Bill did an excellent job as always being so funny. There was some amazing points in the movie that was so funny, and no I will not list them cause I do not want to spoil this for you, but it was like watching ""Saturday Night Live"" at its best, it was that good. My son and his friend loved this film. If you are looking for that movie for your sons as a gift, give this one. I would say that need to be about 12 or older to understand some of the two sided puns, but it is really a family friendly movie that actually everyone would enjoy. My daughter, who is 8 years old, loved this too, but did not understand some of the deeper ""Saturday Night Live"" type puns. But she still loved it. Buy this one.

The classic Christmas Carol story has long needed an updated version, and this is by far the best remake I have seen of this story in years.  Bill Murray plays the perfect Ebenezer Scrooge, and the movie is so very well written and well cast it's hard to resist watching it again and again.

There are parts in this film that still make me laugh-out-loud, even though I've seen it several times (the restaurant scene comes to mind).  The direction and cinematography is outstanding, but the exquisite casting is by far the premier attraction.

Bill Murray's performance was funny, and his character developed so nicely that I could see the change and connect with it.

Unfortunately I think the relationship was oversexualized between Bill Murray's character and his lover. But if some of the unnecessary references to sex were taken out I think his love for the girl was a great motivation for him to soften his heart.

1057421,4,6305609764,"I couldn't find a free version of ""Scrooged"" and really wanted to see it right now, so I was able to give my personal information, download a required application, and paid less than three bucks for a 48 hour rental. I won't need to see the movie again for a few days, and by then I'll be reunited with my DVD.

The movie itself is quite good. Richard Donner does an excellent job of directing and the cast of stars are thankfully-muted. If you know who they are (coming from the pre-internet era) great. If you don't, the movie works just fine. I haven't seen the ""Oceans Eleven"" remakes or recent Quentin Tarantino movies, but it's hard to imagine so many stars getting together for a single movie with a single point. The best we have are ""The Avengers"", which may say something about what kind of world we currently live in.

This movie had an all-star cast, and a sit-com plot, but worked extremely well. They obviously couldn't make too many references to God, much less to the birth of Jesus, but did an excellent job of setting up the moral conundrums Dickens raised, translated to a modern-movie format. Bob Cratchit had to be split up into two characters, one the coolie (which was her last name) who rears Tiny Tim and the other a hilarious Bobcat Goldwaith [I can't believe I just wrote that, but there you go] as the abused employee

The movie set us up for the happy reunion with Frank's girlfriend. It set up the entire IBC network's plans for a live Christmas special. It re-enacted ""The Little Match Girl"" in one of the most tear-jerking moments I've ever seen in any movie, when Frank sees Herman frozen to death. This is a Christmas special.

When we get to the final ghost arriving, reality gets blurred. We know why Frank doesn't see the signs, we see how the Ghost of Christmas Future makes his move, the amazing soundtrack encourages the feel of the movie, and the focus on Frank's brother and ex-girlfriend helps us ignore the truth of who's burning in that coffin. It's Frank. Only Frank. He's dead, and nothing will ever help him again. To those who know the original, it's a given. To those who enjoyed the hilarious ghosts (David Johansen and Carol Kane) it's an obvious step, if we're worried about someone else's soul. Frank's the one dying. His ex-girlfriend has taken his lessons to heart, and I give Karen Allen a lot of credit for acting in the scene where she's an ice-queen, shoving children away because they disturb her. She'd already been playing a cute young girl at an age where she definitely wasn't a cute young girl.

The sit-com plot helps the ending, as Frank [Scrooge] has his re-awakening] and runs into Bobcat Goldwaith with a shotgun, while Beethoven's ""Hallelujah"" plays. The rest of the story work out like a good sit-com episode, except there's something missing. But the missing piece appears when Calvo [Tiny Tim] speaks to say ""God bless us all, every one.' It was set up in the plot, we all knew it was coming, but the story would not work without at least the most minimal acknowledgement of God's blessing for everybody. And it happened, and it worked. Thank God. Merry Christmas.",1388102400,,3139,4.618279569892473

1057930,5,6305609764,"First, I'm reviewing the HD streaming version of this film. And I'm happy to report that it looks great. There's plenty of detail, and the machine guns really gleam as Mrs. Claus distributes them to the elves from the gun cabinet. ;-) Seriously, the picture is sharp, and as of this date it streams for free if you are a Prime member. If you aren't a Prime member, I'd consider getting the Blu ray, as (again of this date) it only costs about nine bucks. That's dirt cheap for a good Blu ray, and other reviewers here report that it IS a good Blu ray.

On to the movie. Along with Groundhog Day and The Man Who Knew Too Little, this is one of my favorite Bill Murray films. (Caddy Shack would be in there too, but I don't really regard that as just a Bill Murray film).

In this modernized and ""comedized?"" version of ""A Christmas Carol"", Murray is brilliant as the amoral, heartless TV exec, and the movie takes no prisoners in spoofing that business. Laugh out loud scenes abound, even after repeated viewings. The ""Live Christmas Carol"" within the movie particularly has a host of funny scenes in connection with it, even as the film follows the general course of the original tale.

It's unbelievable to me that this film was released in 1988. It just doesn't seem that old. Like all good movies, the story and the jokes are ageless.

Highly recommended.",1387584000,2,1358,4.508130081300813

1058324,2,6305609764,"Scrooged is a mildly dark comedy framed by a basic retelling of the Dickens classic Christmas story, set in pre-internet New York with Murray playing Scrooge-as-heartless-TV-mogul. The cutting edge for the time graphics are campy at best today. Characters aside from Bill are one-dimensional, and even Bill is one-dimensional until the last 10 minutes, showing few cracks to his selfish and nihilistic exterior before a character turn at the ninth hour that feels unbelievable even given the unbelievable events of the movie. Glued together by cheap jokes, slapstick, and the strength of a borrowed classic, Scrooged is barely entertaining, carried entirely by Bill Murray's comedic timing and delivery (all of which are abandoned in Bill's disappointing final, very long monologue). If you want Murray in a ""weird things are afoot"" 90s comedy, go with Groundhog Day instead.",1387152000,,875,5.394160583941606

With a great cast of supporting characters, including two of Murray's brothers, you will reach for this  DVD at the start of every Christmas season (and sometimes in July!).",1386979200,,480,4.841463414634147

1058450,2,6305609764,"Bill Murray is normally pretty funny but he can be pretty crude. (I do realize that this is all written into the script) So, I guess the writers felt that he had to be really bad to make the transition to good that much more significant. Most other portrayals of the Dicken's classic managed to accomplish that without making the character excessively crude. Also, It seemed especially troubling that the character needed to take God's name in vain so often. I found the movie to be overly crude and offensive. In fact, it was so bad that I decided not to finish it.",1386892800,,566,4.504854368932039

Bill Murray is very funny, Bob Goldthwait is hilarious in his supporting role and the production is an inventive retelling of the classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and his visit by three ghosts of Christmas.  There are some great deadpan moments such as when Bill calls his college girlfriend on the phone, looks at his watch and leaves her a message that he has is sorry that he hasn't spoken to her in 15 years.  It is a moment of comedy genius.  David Johansen, Carol Kane, Alfre Woodard and a cast of hundreds do a good job of supporting Murray and giving him plenty of straight material from which he gets to ham it up.

Instead of being a miser Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is the nastiest, most insensitive and conniving boss you could ever hope to never work for.  As head of a TV network he treats everyone under him like garbage.  The plot of this film is to have Cross, like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, learn the error of his ways and reform.  He has filmed a show called ""The Night The Reindeer Died"" (where terrorists attack Santa's workshop) and can't imagine why anyone would be upset by the violence.  He has also scheduled a live performance of the Carol on Christmas eve without regard for anyone who has to appear on the show. Through the intervention of his dead boss, Lew Hayward (taking the place of Jacob Marley) he learns that he is going to be haunted, etc.  We learn that he had a bad childhood, that he is a liar and a manipulator and that he cares only for himself.  Of course he is redeemed and he breaks into the set of the show and delivers a much too long, rambling and incoherent speech about how we should all love one another.

The film itself never really reaches levels of originality or depth of character development that could have been spurned from this concept, always content with resting within the box that has already been boarded up around the genre, but Murray's acidic delivery makes for such a deliciously enjoyable film.

This modern-day version of the beloved tale is a good combination of zaniness and message. The cast is good all around, though Bobcat Goldthwait's schtick wears thin in short order.

The film sags at the end with an extended ""redemption"" scene that could have used a rewrite...or maybe it had too many rewrites. It really needed to be tightened up, and it becomes a bit embarrassing as it goes on and on in a ""will this never end?"" way.

I own the DVD of this film. Unlike most of my other Xmas movies on DVD, I haven't seen fit to upgrade this one to BD (though the fact that the BD price has just dropped below $10 is an enticement). Maybe I'll do so for Xmas, 2013...",1362960000,,709,4.315789473684211

Even though the whole thing is tongue-in-cheek (with a great, all-star cast), they manage to turn it into kind of a tear-jerker at the end.

Although Scrooged is not set in an environment we can all relate to, Bill Murray is true to his typical interpretation as he has a personal ""Scrooge"" experience.

It's a dark, biting and sarcastic take on the tale that's set firmly in the murk of the corporation-friendly '80s, but it completely falls apart on the back nine. The first act is an inspired lampoon of bad network television (and the bad network executives behind it) with Murray, deliciously sinister as the worst boss in America, at the height of his powers. It's when the narrative tries to cram in a tepid love story and a sudden, jolting redemption that the cornerstones begin to crumble. This really could've worked if it didn't wear its intentions and inspirations so garishly on its chest, but subtlety is, sadly, not among the picture's attributes.

1059480,5,6305609764,"In the early days of ""Saturday Night Live"" staff writer Michael O'Donoghue's contributions could be identified by their macabre nature.  For a short time around 1982 he was the head staffer and his most notorious contribution was a Halloween show hosted by Donald Pleasence that for its disturbing qualities was never shown again.  Shortly thereafter there was a purge because of a sketch of O'Donoghue's that didn't pass standards and practices.  The initial reaction to ""Scrooged"" was somewhat interesting.  To many the film's strangeness was offputting.  At the time, personally, I found its message of peace, love, and brotherhood after 90 minutes of mildly shocking humor a tad cynical.  Time, however, has caught up with ""Scrooged"".  What wasn't considered acceptable then is now the norm.  Apatow, the Farrellys, and Phillips have pushed the enevelope for better or for worse and our tolerances have followed suit.  Viewed now it appears that O'Donoghue and co-writer Mitch Glazer have deliciously married their askewed sensibilities to Dickensian prose.  Bill Murray as a latter day Scrooge is nothing short of brilliant.  You'd have to blink to see any demeanor change from affable Peter Venkman to nasty TV executive Frank Cross.  Let's just say that Murray with great subtlety is exhibiting the dark side of his too-cool-for-school screen persona.  Great supporting cast notably David Johansen and Carol Kane as the ghosts who visit upon Frank.  One of my gripes back when I saw this in 1988 was the seemingly improvised monologue by Murray at the end of the film that at the time I found phony.  For whatever reason, the passage of time I guess, it now seems sincere.  This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" may not be everybody but, hey, Dickens crafted his tale for all tastes.

I've been looking for a place that was a legitimate business that sold downloadable movies, much like I see done with music songs and cds. The thing is...while Amazon unbox will let you download the movie to your computer, you will not be able to watch it away from your computer.

According to what is advertised, you may be able to see it on your tv via XBOX 360's Media Center and the appropriate connections. That's cool, if that is what you are looking for. I was simply looking for a fast legal way of seeing movies. The only way the movie I downloaded can be seen is on my PC. From my viewpoint, Amazon unbox is not worth even trying, unless you are extremely techy and like challenges.

What if my mother wanted to try downloading a movie by herself? Either the process needs to be easier, or the unboxing option needs to go.

This is the absolute worst film I have ever seen starring Bill Murray.  Could he have read the script before agreeing to be in this?  It was horrible.  It literally makes me feel sad that anyone could have found humor in this....mess, this disastrous mess of a movie.  And yet it had so many good reviews on Amazon.  Seriously people?  I would give it a more thorough analysis, but it pains me to ponder it.  There was little to redeem it.  OK maybe the first ghost, the Christmas-Past ghost was interesting.

Everything about this movie works, from the radiant Karen Allen to the slow-motion meltdown of Bobcat Goldthwait's unfortunate programming exec. And even if you find that Murray's one-liners aren't your thing, the line-up of his network's surreal production of A Christmas Carol is bound to raise a smile.

As Frank (Bill Murray) is leaving the network building late one night, he passes some 'street musicians.'  They're unmistakably Paul Shaffer, David Sanborn, Larry Carlton, and Miles Davis playing 'We Three Kings.'  Yes, it's on the soundtrack CD.)

But I just can't bring myself to drink Tab and Stoli, no matter how trendy it might have been in the 80's.

1060039,3,6305609764,"SCROOGED starts off with a really big laugh: It shows promos for upcoming Christmas specials on Frank Cross' (Bill Murray)TV station IBC. (The first one is the funniest, and I wouldn't dream of revealing it here). When Cross' board of executives show him the promo for the upcoming live broadcast of Scrooge, the laughs continue with the people they've cast. But Frank doesn't like the promo and runs a videotape of a really tastless commercial for Scrooge. When his executive Elliot Laudermilk (Bobcat Goldwaith) objects to it, he creates another laugh by telling Cross what it resembled. He tells his loyal but overworked secretary Grace (Alfre Woodward) that Elliot is fired, right before Christmas Eve. Clearly Frank is a mean boss just like Ebenezor Scrooge, and at this point although he is nasty, he is still funny. He is not only mean to the people he works, but also to his brother James (Frank Murray: Bill's real life brother)

At this point I figured that SCROOGED would continue to be funny, especially when Frank's boss Preston (Robert Mitchum)tells him that they could increase their ratings and profits by appealing to cats and dogs as potential viewers. At that point Frank receives a visit by his old boss Lew Hayworth (John Forsythe). Lew has a funny line after Frank tries to shoot him and fails. After this, we are introduced to his old girlfriend Claire (Karen Allen). One of the workers tells him of a problem of getting antlers onto a mouse's head. Murray's suggestion of what to do gave me one of the biggest laughs I ever had at the movies. At this point I was confident that the laughs would continue, and they did with the ghosts off Christmas Past (David Johanson: AKA Buster Poindexter from the song ""Hot, Hot, Hot), Present (Carol Kane as a violent fairy: VERY funny), and Future (unknown actor).

But right at this point the movie started to turn mean and not funny. Murry does two examples of real cruelty when he shouts at Grace's son Calvin (who refuses to speak), and what he tells his old girlfriend Claire (Karen Allen)to do at the homeless shelter where she volunteers. Fortunately, at the homeless shelter the movie creates another laugh from Herman (the wonderful Michael J. Pollard), and Eva (Anne Ramsey, playing a lovable woman for a change).

Murray continues to be mean, although he was beginning to realize with the Ghost of Christmas Present just how miserable his life really was getting. Before he sees the Ghost of Christmas Future Elliot Laudermilk returns to get revenge for getting fired. This creates some more laughs, and when Frank has seen what will happen in the future he knows what he has to do. The changes in his attitude continue to be funny, and then Frank goes to the soundstage where he breaks down in a long speech during the live broadcast and confesses how wrong he had been.

It is at this point that the movie really loses itself. Murray's long speech drags on, and on, and on. Although it is obligatory in any version of Scrooge to have a change of heart, this movie just pounds it and the overall message into you like a sledgehammer. Murray just doesn't stop. (In an interview Murray claimed that Director Richard Donner kept telling him to talk louder, and louder.)

Did I enjoy the movie enough to recommend it? I guess I did. It kept giving me some really BIG laughs, which is the one thing I ask for any type of comedy. I can laugh really hard at comedies that are in REALLY bad taste (BAD SANTA is the best example), but when the main character gets as gooey and sentimental as Murray does at the end of SCROOGE, the movie stops working. I understand the universal message of Scrooge, but I feel that with this version Richard Donner should have toned the ending down.",1293408000,,3748,4.68133535660091

While the first half of the film is somewhat watchable, the second half really falls apart, and the ending just drags on and on. I'm not quite sure how a 90 minute movie can have a final scene drag out for over 3 hours...but somehow ""Scrooged"" manages it.

Bill Murray is not a good ""Scrooge"", he's not evil, he's just a snarky over-acting whiner, he's more annoying than mean. Watching him relive a bland past, as it melts into a bland present, leading to his bland future...is simply dull.

1060084,5,6305609764,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

This is a wonderful movie that takes wisps of Charles Dickens' concept for ""A Christmas Carol"" and reimagines the story in 20th Century America.  Comedy icon Bill Murray plays Francis Xavier Cross, a hardhearted businessman and stand-in for Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge.  Director Richard Donner uses a great cast in spinning a boldly unique adaptation.

Frank Cross is a television executive, and Mr. Murray plays him as cynical and mean, but not without a sourly humorous wit.  Cross's television station is staging an elaborate production of ""A Christmas Carol,"" or ""Scrooge,"" as the movie calls it. The movie's creative team chooses to suspend Frank Cross between an array of mostly unique ghosts and his actual working environment for the duration of the famed Dickensian ghostly visitations.  Aside from the creative distinction this gives this particular adaptation, this method provides a barometer to judge degrees of change in the main character by playing Cross's changing reactions to his colleagues off of the affect a given ghost has on him.  Bill Murray gives a fantastically nuanced comic performance.

Several noteworthy actors fill out the cast, from Bobcat Goldthwaite as sweetly meek Elliot Loudermilk to Alfre Woodard as Grace Cooley, Cross's put-upon secretary.  Additionally, Karen Allen is great as Claire Phillips, the altruistric woman who may still have a soft spot for the sniping Frank Cross.

Check out ""Scrooged.""  It is one of the better creative adaptations of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" and showcases a very good performance from Bill Murray.",1291248000,,1593,5.357429718875502
1060085,2,6305609764,"yeah while there were times of tenderness (the close-ups of karen allen, the scenes at Bill Murray's brothers home (of course reminiscent of Scrooge's own nephews feast), the film seemed rushed in every scene, especially the ending, after he finds out he didn't die, its just horrid. What was funny about it? Oh and what about the whole disgustingly rushed Ghost of Xmas Past scenes, I know 14 year olds who can do a better job at creating that Ghost and how unoriginal, I mean really. So far so original, but, those scenes, just deplorable. Ahhh with more Bill Murray's over acting in nearly everything he does, or the fact that the only really PURE Gem, was Carol Kane playing the fairy as Ghost of Christmas Present, she was just stellar.

1060156,4,6305609764,"I had very mixed feelings about Bill Murray through most of the 80s.  He was never one of my very favorites on SNL - seems to me he skated through that show, and though his easy charm was often an asset, sometimes it just looked lazy.  In his film work, he seemed to get increasingly ornery in his sarcastic attitudes, climaxing I think with the GHOSTBUSTERS films, where he almost seems to be mocking the audience and the rest of the cast and crew, acknowledging how stupid this crap is and that he's just going for the payoff.  At least, that was my take on him at the time, and by the early 90s I'd just about had enough of him; thankfully WHAT ABOUT BOB? and GROUNDHOG DAY changed my mind.  And the rest is history, as he's gone on to have arguably the best and most interesting career of any SNL alum.  Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin are doing stupid family comedies and endless sequels; Murray is working with Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch.  'Nuff said.

SCROOGED comes from the period that I still have some issues with, but the thing is, he's SUPPOSED to be a total jerk throughout most of the film, and the snappy one-liners and flip attitude just help to make Scrooge (here TV executive Frank Cross) a little different from other Scrooges, and more relevant today; at least it feels like that's what's being attempted.  It worked pretty well, really, up until the ending transformation which, being still pretty much played for laughs, rings rather hollow.  Maybe we're not supposed to really believe in it or care, as long as we've had some good yucks?  I dunno.

Anyway, it all boils down to our exec Frank putting on his own version of ""A Christmas Carol"", this one totally over-the-top and promoted so heavily that ""nobody will want to miss it"", with commercials so intense that one old lady dies while watching the ad.  Frank of course thinks it's a good idea to use that as part of the promotion.  But he's such a nasty and seemingly irredeemable egomaniac that his old dead partner Lew (John Forsyth) decides to send our familar ghostly friends to visit him and show him just how worthwhile the holiday that he sneers at really is.  They are cheroot-chomping cabbie David Johansen (Past), sadistic fairy Carol Kane (Present) and a more traditional skeletal Yet To Come, and they show him his happier, less-greedy life (with girlfriend Karen Allen who in this rendition is still around to give our younger-than-usual Scrooge/Cross a different kind of happy ending after the credits roll), all the ways he could help out others, etc.  You know the drill.

The cast is the best thing about this; even if I'm still a bit amibivalent about Murray in this role, you can't really mind any movie that features a put-upon Bobcat Goldthwaite and tough-but-resigned Alfre Woodard sharing duties as the Bob Cratchit figure; Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim; Robert Mitchum as the certifiable insane network CEO who wants to make programs for cats; and best of all, Lee Majors as himself playing a commando come to rescue Santa in the faux-Christmas special ""The Night the Reindeer Died"" that opens the film.

""Lee, this is ONE Santa who's goin' out the FRONT door.""

Yeah, it's not the most ""Christmasy"" holiday movie, but it's definitely got it's moments.",1261612800,,3255,4.680701754385965
1060157,4,6305609764,"Imagine Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol set in the modern world. That's what director Richard Donner and writers Mitch Glazer & Michael O'Donoghue have brought us. Instead of 19th-Century Britain, it's now 20th-Century New York City. Instead of Ebenezer Scrooge, we get Bill Murray as Frank Cross. Instead of sentimental drama, we get some satirical and verbal comedy. The only things that stays the same are the three ghosts, the Scrooge personality, and the definition of Christmas. I wouldn't consider this one of the greatest films of the holidays, but I will say that it works well as a Bill Murry comedy. There are dozens of funny jokes and plentiful sight gags that you can enjoy watching again and again. Overall, I'd say that this is a very good Christmas film and I did enjoy watching it, but please not that it may not be appropriate for little kids.",1261094400,,865,4.8120805369127515
1060191,5,6305609764,"When I first saw this years ago, I thought it was OK, but not great. Something bothered me about the film; it was a wicked & dark-humored modern-day satire of the Dickens classic. Yet, it seemed stuck in the middle of its intentions, as if the script needed to be sharper. Over the years, the movie has grown on me, thanks largely to the comedic talent of Bill Murray. Playing nasty, cold-as-ice TV executive Frank Cross who is ultimately shown the light by ""three spirits"" & reforms himself in time on Christmas night, it's clear that Murray's having fun with the role. There's tons of guest starring roles in this film---too many to mention here, you'll just have to watch the movie---but Murray works his magic & hijacks the film with his performance.
For a comedy, it's an amazingly ambitious production. Co-scripted by late former SNL writer Mike O'Donoghue, ""Scrooged"" has its moments of wicked, ugly satire. Even during its most broadly slapstick moments, it's somewhat brutally sadistic (especially when Cross gets repeatedly clobbered by the pixie-ish but hands-on Ghost of Christmas Present, played with relish by Carol Kane). Its during its darkest that the film earns its PG-13 rating: Children might be frightened by the moldy ghost of Cross' old boss (John Forsythe), the traditionally scary Ghost of Christmas Future, and especially, Cross getting nearly cremated.
Viewers will either find the climactic monologue from Cross to ""put a little love in your heart"" engaging or annoying. But at its best, ""Scrooged"" is a satirical, occasionally dark tale of corrupt moral standards in the media, and a tale of finding one's heart.",1261094400,,1641,5.036764705882353
1060192,5,6305609764,This is one of the few great Christmas movies. Someone needs to make more great christmas movies!,1260921600,,97,4.764705882352941
1060193,5,6305609764,"Summary: Frank Cross, the president of a television network(played by Bill Murray) leads the typical life of a scummy, self-obsessed businessman. On the eve that his television station is to broadcast a live filming of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Frank is visited by the three ghosts of Christmas, who proceed to pummel him emotionally, psychologically, and even physically, in order to teach him the true meaning of Christmas, and also how to sing really badly in front of a camera for a movie finale.

What About It: Yes, this is another Christmas movie where the character learns the error of his ways after looking into the past, present, and future of his life and those around him. Obviously, the film-makers weren't trying to hide the fact that this is a present day Christmas Carol: it functions as a plot device to keep the ""day that Frank meets his destiny"" rolling, and it works, maybe even better than the original. Although Frank, and all of the people around him, may think he's going crazy, the movie stays grounded enough to make it believable that Frank has not missed Christmas, and can begin to fix his life, starting with the little mute kid who finally starts talking.

  The movie is cheesy, but in a good way. Everything Frank Cross does is obvious and schticky, but it's that comfort zone of knowing what's coming that allows the quirky parts of the film to be accepted. (""Niagara Falls, Frankie angel."")

  The biggest nod in the movie goes to Bill Murray, of course, but not for acting ability alone. He shares the screen well with such talented under-the-radar actors and actresses such as Carol Kane, David Johansen, Karen Allen, and the illustrious Bobcat Goldthwait, to the point that you wonder why those stars haven't risen very high. Murray makes everyone around him better.",1260921600,,1815,4.854368932038835
1060194,5,6305609764,"Bill Murray absolutely shines in this mega production of the Charles Dickens Scrooge Christmas Carol done in the fashion of high rise buildings, and it's corporated executives. Karen Allen give Bill his much needed parallel as the girlfriend he eventually let go to greed. Karen, by the way, is probably the most talented and exciting girlfriend to Scrooge character because she does more than fill the gap, she gives a performance to capture the lost love of which she was so apart of in the first place. The remaining cast cannot be commended enough with many cameos by famous celebrities, and stars of hollywood's past like Buddy Hackett as the television stage production's Scrooge.
Thankfully there are no musical numbers, but quite a few inventive skits and alternate scenes of a modern society with a real life Scrooge in the quise of head honcho Bill Murray. The score, however, is quite suitable for the comedic backdrops. Evidentlly, they spared no expense in this particular production right after the era of Christopher Reeve's Superman, and they both have the same look and charisma. A delightful motion picture that will have your head turning to the set.
As an added attraction, Bill Murray ends the movie by giving us all a mean spirited Christmas pep talk, which is actually meant for his own TV audience but transcends to ours. Kudos to the Eurythmics song finale!",1260662400,,1382,4.935622317596566

Ms. Kane's energy, infinite imagination, and total commitment to her role, produces a richly textured character which is humorous, poignant, and utterly entertaining. In one scene, Ms. Kane tells Bill Murray to close his eyes, and then makes a simply magical speech which perfectly communicates every delicate emotion she wants to convey to us.

Other funny scenes-

- a young Bill Murray receives a pack of meat for Christmas during a ""Ghost of Christmas past"" moment.

- The ""Ghost of Christmas present"" kept slapping Bill Murray around Three Stooges style, lol.

- One of his employees had a picture of her childs drawing hanging by the side of her desk, and Bill Murray ripped it up right in front of her.

- When Bill Murray was full of love and feeling positive about everything, the one psycho employee of his that tried to kill Murray with a shotgun (who was chasing Murray around the room a moment earlier) got the surprise of his life- Bill Murray showering him with love and affection RIGHT after ""Ghost of Christmas future"" showed Bill Murray the error of his ways, lol.

However, when I recently ordered it via Amazon, and watched it again, I found it better than I had rememebered and thoroughly enjoyed it as a new Christmas movie showing.  Obviously, it cannot be really compared to being a remake of the original ""A Christmas Carol"" movie (Alastair Sim's being the best), but instead, this is more a modern telling of the story while paying tribute to the original (in much the same way ""Family Man"" or ""Santa Clause 3"" somewhat does with the storyline of ""It's a Wonderful Life""--one of the best movies of all time).  For those who haven't seen ""Scrooged"", it's about a successful (depending on how he measures success) TV exec (Bill Murray) preparing to broadcast a live play/musical of ""A Christmas Carol"".  Murray's character and the movie is similar to ""Groundhog Day"" in it's darkness, yet perhaps a little more meaner...but to well played comic effect, which plays out to the very meaningful, heart-warming end of good-will to others, though perhaps it could have been more meaningful with a little more pointing towards the First Christmas story (like Dicken's story did in mentioning the meaning behind the Christ), but it's still a fun ride.

1060290,4,6305609764,"Scrooged, ""suggested"" by Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, is a modern/1980s upgrade to a TV president who is actually making a Scrooge TV show.  When someone dies because of his shocking ads, he says ""great"" and puts a warning for people with weak hearts not to watch it!

Some cameos with Buddy Hackett, Jaimie Farr (M*A*S*H), oh yeah, Claire, you know, the gal on the Indiana Jones films.  Lots of fun with this one.

Before the day is done he gets in a cab which goes to the past where four year old frank gets a pound of veal for his Christmas present.  In the present, a fairy that beats the snot out of him ""The b*tch hit me with a toaster!""  The future dead guy who shows Frank being burned alive in a coffin.

The ending is a bit smarmy and saccharin, but overall hearing the old 80s songs again on Christmas Eve really does make it possible to get a bit of that spirit only a few hours a year, and with Murray wanting that stretched to the other 364.

I read some trivia on this film:  The scene where you see Dick (arrow) Lauren on a tree in the Christmas Carol set is the director Richard Donner and his wife Lauren.

When Bill Murray says ""feed me Seymour"" at the end, he is referring to an earlier bit he played in the film ""Little Shop of Horrors.""

Great rental! Remember this is a satire, not a Dickens true version.

PS:  Loved John Glover (Smallville) as the bright, smarmy TV director.

1060364,4,6305609764,"Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is the youngest president in the history of IBC, a television network.  He got where he is by being driven, ruthless, and completely uncaring about everyone else around him.  When his old boss (John Forsythe) comes back from the grave to pay him a visit, he's told to expect three ghosts on Christmas Eve.  Yes, this is an update of the Charles Dickens classic and you can work out 90% of the plot just knowing that.  There are some wrinkles such as the increased focus on a romantic relationship with Karen Allen but the basic story is the same.

The first key to enjoying this movie is that one must be able to accept it on its own terms.  This is strictly tongue-in-cheek.  Frank is getting the ""Scrooge"" treatment even as he oversees a production of A Christmas Carol so this all happens to a guy who knows the whole scenario before it begins.  Murray does is his typical self whether you love him or hate him.  He mugs to the camera, smirks, grimaces, and gives his distinctly timed speeches that made him a star.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent including a great cameo by Lee Majors.  Carol Kane is memorable as the ghost of Christmas past and Robert Mitchum does a great job as his pet-obsessed boss.

As long as you can relax and enjoy the ride, this is a terrific movie.  If you want a more traditional or serious rendition of the Dickens story you will not be happy with this film.  It's a silly comedy that relies heavily, though not exclusively, on Bill Murray's humor so it helps a lot if you like him.

1060365,5,6305609764,"""Scrooged"" starring Bill Murray, Robert Mitchum, Karen Allen, John Forsythe, and Alfre Woodard is a funny heartwarming rendition of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"".  While it's among the many Christmas movies we own, it's one of the few that I really watching over and over. Bill Murray is perfect for the role of Frank Cross, the ""Scrooge"" of this modern version.
Frank is one of the bigwigs of the station, and a rather cruel, unfeeling, coldhearted type of boss.
After a hard day of previewing over the nasty promos he's made for Christmas t.v. movies, Frank is visited by John Forsythe's(best known as the voice of Charlie in the t.v. show ""Charlie's Angels"") character, which is supposed to be like Jacob Marley.  Excuse me for forgetting his characters name.  I should know that by now, but it escapes me at the moment.  Frank flips out after and calls his ex, for the past 15 years, Claire(Karen Allen, ""Raiders of the lost arc"" and ""Animal House"")for help.  She shows up on the set of the ""Scrooge"" that his station is putting on, and there relationship sort of starts up again as she helps him(along with the three spirits) realize what's really important in life.
Buster Poindexter is the Ghost of Christmas Past, and while I know him only for his stints as a musician both for the New York Dolls and his hit ""Hot, Hot, Hot"", he was hilarious and actually very good acting in the role.
Carol Kane, better known as Simka in the 70's t.v. show ""Taxi"", plays the ghost of Christmas Present"".  She adds her own sense of humor and could have quite possibly adlibbed or did some improv of her own in addition to the script that was handed to her.
The ghost of the future, or the grim reaper, as that is what it looks like, brings Frank to light on what will happen if he doesn't change his ways.
Most of the cast did a great job, perfectly cast as they were, for the most part, except for Robert Mitchum, who I always thought was a bad actor.  It's really Murray's vehicle, and he drives it so precisely perfect.
This is a funny, funny, did i say funny yet? version of the Charles Dicken's story on film that will be cherished forever in my household.",1197331200,3,2155,4.51025641025641

1060457,4,6305609764,"1988's ""Scrooged"" is Director Richard Donner's updated version of the Dickens classic ""A Christmas Carol"", now set in the rough and tumble entertainment industry in New York City.

Bill Murray plays Scrooge as a young and cynical TV network head, producing a truly horrifying annual Christmas special while merrily firing employees.  John Forsythe plays his dead Jacob Marley-like mentor, while Alfre Woodward does a nice turn on the Bob Crachit role as Murray's long-suffering and underpaid secretary.  Carol Kane is delightful as Murray's first and maladroit Christmas ghost.  Karen Allen does a soulful turn as Murray's long-lost love, now performing good deeds in a soup kitchen.

Donner's version is reasonably faithful to the general storyline, with an emphasis more on dark humor than on the horror of Scrooge's traditional ghostly visitations.  Bill Murray's Network President, as it turns out, had a miserable childhood and a failed romance, making him a sympathetic character for the audience and making his eventual redemption a joyful event.

  Bill Murray puts his own twist on Charles Dicken's Christmas Carol. As Frank Cross, the ambitious no holds barred TV exectutive, he is determined to make his mark on holiday progrmming.  His Christmas Carol includes Mary Lou Retton as well as the Solid Gold Dancers(There are some dated cultural references) and the obligatory old fart narrating the program's story ...apologies to the late, great John Houseman.

Great support from Alfrie Woodard, Carol Kane, David Johansen (New York Dolls frontman), the usual mix of Murray siblings, and the late Robert Mitchum (Frank's boss who is always looking for the newest TV trend)  among others.

This movie actually included the line ""You're like boating a marlin"", when Bill drags the found-again renewed romantic interest (Karen Allen, who also suffers thru delivering terrible lines poorly directed) into the broadcast frame for the final (lame attempt at) satiric-but-sappy scene.  The movie had pretty art design and nice cinematography, but the direction was twitchy and unfocused and the pacing was overwhelmingly fast.  There was no sense of special redemption because Murray mostly displayed the same general social ills, turned up a notch, as half the other characters in the film.  It was near impossible to find anything sympathetic in the half of the Crochett character represented by Luddmilk (Bobcat Goldthwait), especially once he becomes a rifle-wielding revenge seeking drunk.  Murray's Scrooge is merely lost, not greedy, merely uncaring and preoccupied and socially phobic, if extraordinarily snarky about it, not the possessor of a well-developed philosophy antithetical to the spirit of Christmas, like Dickens' original.  I'm not against a modern-day sardonic take on A Christmas Carol; I'd just like the jokes to be funny and the exercise to have a point, the original one or some *interesting* alternative, and this one had none of that...

1060535,5,6305609764,"When I first looked up the 1988 Christmas movie comedy, ""Scrooged"" on Amazon, I was greatly surprised to see it had recieved four stars. This is because I have for so long seen this film vilified by the media. It seems like every holiday season, when the 'Best-Worst' lists are made up, some smart-alecky critic always snootily declares ""Scrooged"" (in your best Simpsons Comic Book Guy voice..) ""Worst, 'A Christmas Carol' remake...EVERRRR!!!""

These critisms always left me with the nagging feeling, that I was the only person on earth, who had any sort of appreciation for this film. In fact I love it! I love it so much, that every first of December, when I'm picking out of my collection all the holiday, film favorites, I'm going to show, ""Scrooged"" is usually the first one to hit the old DVD laser.

Everyone pretty much knows the plot of Charles Dicken's classic story, ""A Christmas Carol"". We all know about Christmas meanie, Ebeneezer ""Bah Humbug!"" Scrooge and the three ghosts (Past, Present & Future), who are sent to teach him the true meaning of the Christmas spirit.

In this film-comedy version of the story, the setting is the modern day (O.K., 1980's) New York television industry. We meet Frank Cross (Bill Murray), President of the IBC television network. Too say the permanently scowling, workaholic, Frank isn't a very nice guy, would be an understatement. He treats his employees like garbage (he times how long it takes to throw fired executives into the streets) and approaches the Christmas holidays with an insincere glee. He pronounces Christmas to be a ""crock"", while in the same breath declares himself one of its' ""biggest supporters"" because, ""it's cold outside and people stay home to watch lots of TV""!

Well, we all know Frank's reckoning is coming and it's in the form of a  country-club garbed, rotting corpse of his former boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsythe). He warns Frank of his bleak future and tells him of course about the three ghosts that will visit. They come during an overly ostentatious (it features the 'Solid Gold Dancers'!), live, Christmas Eve production of ""Scrooge"". The three ghosts are in the form of 'Christmas Past' (David Johansen), a nasty, cigar chompin', devilish cab driver, 'Christmas Present' (Carol Kane) a slap-happy fairie with a great right cross and finally the monolithic, TV screen faced, reaper garbed, 'Christmas Future'.

What makes this version of the endlessly re-told story so good?  It has a really great, hilariously, funny script (by Mitch Glazer & the late SNL veteran, Michael O'Donahue), which seems to work on many different levels. On one hand it is a thorough, comic retelling of a well known story. It dosn't just give basic plot points, but goes into detail about how & why the Cross/Scrooge character became the nasty pr**k he is. Secondly, it is very wry satire of the television industry exposing it for how cynical and superficial it is. Just look at all the hilarious, satiracle IBC TV promos that are featured including my personal favorite, ""The Night the Reindeer Died"". Finally, the film recognizes, that ""A Christmas Carol"" is not only a holiday tale, but is also actually a haunting ghost story, thats ment to scare ""the Dickens""(pun intended) out of you. This script contains all of this, plus some of the most hilarious quotable dialogue ever found in a Christmas movie (""This is one Santa whos' going through the front door!"").

The other great attribute of this film is the wonderful casting. Make no mistake about it, Bill Murray  is fantastic in this movie! At every turn he scowls, gives dirty looks and lets us know what a rotten and insincere guy Frank Cross is. But whats brilliant is that at the same time he is not just a one note character. He's funny and keeps our interest until we learn to like him.  Other great comic performances in this film come from David Johansen, Carol Kane, Bobcat Goldwait, Karen Allen, John Glover, John Forsythe, Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard and more. There are also some great cameos including Buddy Hackett, Jamie Farr, Mary-Lou Retton, Miles Davis, Paul Shaffer and of course the best of all, Lee Majors! With a cast like that how can you fail??

Finally, I love the music score created by Composer, Danny Elfman (well known for his work on Tim Burton's movies). The music has an almost haunting quality, that underscores the fact, that it is essentially a ghost story. I also love the Annie Lennox-Al Green duet of the old R&B chestnut, ""Put a Little love in Your life"", thats' played over the closing credits. Its' become an annual holiday favorite for me! All in all, this is a wonderfully funny, holiday film, that dosn't deserve the bad rap, that critics have put on it. It's Bill Murray in a great comic performance.

Where a bossy and mean television producer (Bill Murray) who's making a new version of Scrooge gets vistited by 3 ghosts of his own.

  The film is crude and whacky but it also has a sweet side. The ghosts try to reconnect him with a good woman that he broke-up with long ago. With Karen Allen from Raiders of the Lost Ark playing her and adding a needed loveableness to the film. The film needs it since it can be mean spirited. Then it tacks on a happy and goofy  ""we're aware this is a movie you were just watching"" ending.

He's busy promoting his new take on the old fable holiday classic. He's pumping it up to a horrorific action gore fest.

Some of the network exec's don't follow along in his twisted vision. they want to see the classic version.

Aside from his many rude quirks, Francis gets caught up in his own holiday surprise when he is visited by his dead buisness partner who tells him that he will be visited by three spirits. Like us, Francis highly doubts that but nonetheless he is visted by three very eccentric ghosts that are tough to crack his hard shell of ignorance and his forgotten holiday spirit.

Frank even takes pleasure in causing sudden deaths with his frightening television ads for his latest debauchery, a live Christmas Eve presentation of Charles Dickens' immortal classic, ""Scrooge,"" starring Buddy Hackett, Mary Lou Retton, and the Solid Gold Dancers! But, this Christmas, things are going to change for Frank Cross. A frightening encounter with his deceased boss (John Forsythe) leaves Frank with a warning of three more spirits to follow, each on a mission to teach Frank about the joy of Christmas and goodwill towards men; each on a mission to inspire change in the seemingly hopeless and uncaring creature that Frank has become. These aren't your ordinary Christmas spirits, though. These are tough, New York personalities just right for the likes of the modern yuppie scrooges of 1988. The Ghost of Christmas Past is David Johansen, a scruffy, smart-alecky cab-driver that shows Frank the tough times and tenderness of his youth and the choices that took him down the wrong roads in life. The Ghost of  Christmas Present is deceptively-sweet sadist Carol Kane, who shows Frank the hardships of his fellow man, including his own assistant, and the warm feelings that others have, such as his little brother James, that he could be sharing in if he only made the effort. And, finally, the Ghost of Christmas Future pays Frank a terrifying visit that gives him glimpses of a future he'd more than like to avoid. Of course, this is a Scrooge story, and the ending is no mystery, but that won't prevent the incredibly joyous feeling you'll have inside when the miraculous change comes about!

""Scrooged"" truly is a modern classic! A labor of love from one of the most genuinely funny guys around who brought much of his own family along for the ride, ""Scrooged"" was not a huge success for star Bill Murray. Regardless, it eventually became accepted as a true Christmas classic that is enjoyed at least once a year by Christmas fanatics all over, and, in that respect, is not unlike ""It's a Wonderful Life."" The smart, witty writing and visual style, along with fantastic Danny Elfman music and an amazing cast, all make ""Scrooged"" a film that is not to be missed during the holiday season! The star-studded cast also includes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark's"" Karen Allen as Frank's lost love, Claire, Bob Goldthwait as Eliot, one of Frank's unfortunate employees, and ""Smallville's"" John Glover as rival Bryce Cummings, just to name a few. The DVD is thankfully widescreen, but only offers the theatrical trailer as an extra.

Murray plays Frank Cross, president of IBC studios and a mean one too. Firing people who speak their opinions like Elliot Loudermilk {Goldthwait}, giving his own brother {Murray} a towel for Christmas while giving others who are not family a top of the line VCR, and many other mean spirited stuff.

When Cross gets a visit from his dead old boss and best friend Lew Hayward {Forsythe}, Frank begins to worry especially when he tells him that he will be visited by 3 ghosts.

Frank does get his visit from the ghosts, but not in the night like in Charles Dickens; classic, but in many various hours of the day. The Ghost Of Christmas {Johansen}, who's dressed up as a cab driver and even drives a cab. The Ghost Of Christmas Present {Kane}, who looks like a pixie fairy. And The Ghost Of Christmas Future {Conner, Jr.}, who's face looks like a TV screen and has dead people inside his robe.

Frank does meet his old girlfriend from the past, Claire {Allen}, who he hasn't spoken to in 15 years. They both still have feelings for each other, but may not work out until he changes his additue. This film also stars Alfe Woodard as Grace Cooley, Frank's secretary. Robert Mitchum as  Preston Rhinelander, Frank's boss. And John Glover as Bryce Cummings, a jerk who wants Frank's job.

The whole thing revolves around Frank Cross making the most overblown version of Ebeneezer Scrooge for airing on live TV on Christmas eve.

1060688,4,6305609764,"Bill Murray is the new Scrooge in the classic tale done yet again.  I remember a reviewer giving it a low rating because he said it seemed as though Murray's character really didn't like people.  Helllooo, isn't that what actors are supposed to do?  This version of the old Chrsitmas tale is a good retelling of the story.  Murray is mean to everyone including his only brother (played by his real younger brother).  The 3 spirits that visit Frank Cross (Murray's role) are wacky to say the least.  Carol Kane plays the ghost of Christmas present and is probably the funniest of the spirits.  Murray has this act down pat.  He's a big t.v. exec and fires Elliot Laudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) just for disagreeing with him.  By the way, his fires Laudermilk on Christmas eve.

Alfre Woodard plays his longsuffering assistant and tries to be Cross' conscience since he doesn't have one of his own.  In the visit to Christmas past we learn that television played the biggest role in raising him since his parents weren't the greatest in the world.  Christmas doesn't mean much because his parents didn't put up Christmas lights, buy a tree or get him presents.  His father does come home one night and drop a package of veal in front of him as a Christmas gift but the young Frank Cross tells his dad that he wanted a choo-choo train.  His dad, a butcher,  (played by Brain Doyle Murray, Bill Murray's real life brother) is totally unsympathetic and suggests that his son get a job even though he's only four.

There are lots of laughs here as the cast pokes fun at the t.v. industry from behind this comedy.  The end of the film might be a little mushy bit it's fine here since Cross is so mean during the rest of the film.  He even steals a cab from a little old lady carrying a load of packages.  This movie would fit nicely in your holiday collection.

1060689,5,6305609764,"This is one of those offbeat takes on an original classic that many folks are divided on. I personally think this is one of those rare creative works that manage to parody the original tale while still delivering its traditional message.

It's hard to tell how well this 1988 setting would have worked without such an awesome cast, headed by Bill Murray in the Scrooge roll as Frank Cross, only rather than be a miserly recluse, he's an acid-tongued icy-hearted TV executive who is every bit as clever before and after weathering his ghostly visitors. The other chief scene stealers include Carol Kane as an adorable prankster version of The Ghost of Christmas Present, Bob Goldthwait as a modern day deranged Bob Cratchett, and David Johansen as a taxi driving Ghost of Christmas Past.

Matching the humor of the ghostly encounters are the Christmas TV specials that Frank Cross produces: ""The Night the Reindeer Died"" starring Lee Majors, and a live TV taping of ""A Christmas Carol"" starring Buddy Hackett as Scrooge and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

The parody is excellent, but it is not overdone to the point where it lacks emotion. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but also puts some genuine feeling into his role. Karen Allen and Alfre Woodard give moving performances, and although Michael J Pollard's role is too brief, there is something sweet and vulnerable about his eccentric wayward character.

It's hard to tell how this film appeals to the purist fans of ""A Christmas Carol."" Most die-hard Christmas lovers I know enjoyed it, but there are a few who thought it was too silly.

1060781,5,6305609764,"Christmas movies are fun. I like Christmas movies because they're generally nice, lightweight, enjoyable pieces of fluff with important moralistic messages (""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Scrooge"") or sometimes they're just fun to watch (""Gremlins,"" ""Home Alone"").
""Scrooged"" isn't lightweight, cheery, or happy. It's dark, brooding, sort of evil, and it's the only Christmas movie I can think of that seems as if Tim Burton directed it.
Am I insulting the film? Heavens, no. I love it. In fact, I'm complimenting it. Instead of repeating old traditions, it's trying something new, and the secret to the film is the way it actually pulls it all off.
The plot: Frank Cross is the youngest television station president in recorded history because he knows the people. At least he thinks he does. In reality, he's just a greedy tycoon who gives people bath towels for Christmas -- including his own brother.
Cross is a modern day Scrooge, and the movie ""Scrooged"" is a modern reworking of the classic Charles Dickens story. Frank Cross is played by Bill Murray absolutely perfectly. He's cynical, dry, and sarcastic, and doesn't give a darn about anyone else other than himself.
So the night before Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by an old business partner -- who has been dead for seven years. (""I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops,"" says Frank in his usual sarcastic tone.) His old associate warns Frank to change his ways or he'll end up like himself -- angry, bitter...and dead.
Frank doesn't pay any attention to his ""hallucination,"" and continues being his usual self during the festive Christmas holiday -- by ripping off old ladies' cabs and firing Elliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) on Christmas Eve. (Elliot is sort of today's version of Bob Cratchitt.)
Frank is putting on a Christmas Eve production of Charles Dickens' immortal classic ""Scrooge"" (what happened to ""A Christmas Carol,"" I wonder?), and in the film's funniest scene, introduces his ad for the program. (It later scares an old woman to death and Frank takes it as a wonderful sign -- controversy is as good as advertising!)
The three ghosts do indeed come and haunt Frank. Except Frank is more cynical than Ebenezer Scrooge ever was, and convincing him that Christmas is a season of giving will be hard. (Frank: ""I get it, you're here to show me my past and I'm supposed to get all dully eyed and mushy. Well forget it pal, you got the wrong guy."")
Frank is revisited by an old flame (Karen Allen) and his heart starts to beat once again after years of silence. Frank slowly but surely starts to learn to appreciate Christmas once again, following all of Scrooge's examples. His intern's son, who witnessed his father's murder and hasn't spoken since, is a sort of Tiny Tim, and ""Scrooged"" does indeed follow all of the elements of Charles Dickens' classic. Only it updates the tale, throws in a bunch of cameos, and great acting on Murray's behalf.
Frank revisits scenes from his childhood and adulthood first hand with the wacky ghosts as companions. They can't see or hear Frank -- his cab driver ghost tells him that he's in the middle of a rerun.
Frank remembers how his father brought him meat for Christmas, how he broke up with his girlfriend over a matter of greed vs. happiness, and how his life was a complete waste. (Ghost: ""Let's face it, Frank, garden slugs got more out of life than you."" Frank: ""Yeah? Name one!"")
It was a matter of time before ""A Christmas Carol,"" or ""Scrooge,"" got a modernized treatment. And it comes out fresh and ingenious, dark and hilarious. The movie owes its entire success to the casting of Bill Murray, whose cynical ways shone through in such early films as ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters,"" and here compliment the film the way no other actor's talent could.
Take, for example, the way he can remain unmoved but, at the same time, flippant and sarcastic, towards his boss when he tells Frank that cats and dogs are starting to watch television, and that he thinks Frank should target some advertising at the canine and feline demographic. Frank just stares at his boss as if he's crazy and whispers, ""Call the cops.""
The movie was directed by Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon""), and is one of the films I watch as an annual tradition around Christmas. It's dark and often quite disturbing, and its eerie music adds to the mix. But it helps the film because it makes us see through Frank's eyes. And the outcome is, quite frankly, an instant Christmas classic. This is a film I'll be watching for years, and so far, it's only been getting better every time.",1072137600,11,4566,4.788339670468948

Unfortunately, I found this slow to start with. Too long an introduction to Frank Cross (Bill Murray) as the grumpy TV producer person. It really kicked off when the first of the three ghosts appeared - and I found myself reliving my childhood! I loved this book by Charles Dickens as a child, although I was a bad girl, and always skipped to the bit where the ghosts started appearing. I could have done with a skipper on this movie too.
The lovely Karen Allen appears as Frank Cross' ex-girlfriend. I had trouble placing her face, and had to ask - and got the response with a big sigh. I loved her in Starman, and she was great in this movie. The thing about Karen Allen is she has a really nice smile, and makes me want to smile too! I haven't seen her in enough films.
The big singsong was brilliant at the end, and was the highlight of the film for me. Keep watching the credits too, for an extra short bit of Bill Murray doing a little dance.

The film stars the well-known actor/comedian Bill Murray as Francis 'Frank' Xavier Cross, the ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" character of the film.  Frank is a high-rolling, power-hungry, penny-pinching TV executive who decides to produce a live version of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" on his TV station on Christmas Eve.  His secretary, Grace Cooley (Alfre Woodard), is the ""Bob Cratchit"" of the story.  With several children to raise, including her seemingly autistic son Calvin (Nicholas Phillips)--the ""Tiny Tim"" of the story, Grace has no choice but to begrudgingly work for Frank underpaid and under appreciated.  When Frank's boss, Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum, 1917-1997), decides that Frank needs as assistant, the brown-nosing Bryce Cummings (John Glover), Frank becomes extremely jealous; but Frank's problems are only beginning when the ghost of a former coworker, Lou Hayward (John Forsythe), pays him a visit.
There are many memorable scenes in the film including Frank reliving part of his childhood with the taxi-driving Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), Frank reliving meeting his former girlfriend Claire Phillips (Karen Allen) who works in a homeless shelter, Frank seeing his brother James Cross (played by Bill Murray's actual brother, John Murray) and his family celebrating Christmas with the hilarious Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane), Frank being terrorized by a fired employee Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait), Frank meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future (Chaz Conner, Jr.), Frank thinking that a waiter is on fire, the various accidents that the TV censor (Kate McGregor-Stewart) endures, and the ending scenes.  Several cameo appearances include Jamie Farr, Robert Goulet, Buddy Hackett, John Houseman, Lee Majors, Pat McCormick and Mary Lou Retton (who Frank wants to portray his TV ""Tiny Tim"").
There is no way to know whether Charles Dickens (1812-1870) would like this modern remake of his classic story, but I believe that he would love the fact that his story remains just as powerful, entertaining and inspiring today as it was when it was first published in 1843.  Overall, I rate ""Scrooged"" with 5 out of 5 stars for its superb use of poetic license, great humor, engaging plot and wonderful dialog.

Aparently drawn by this theme, he gets close in this re-spin of Dickens' classic featuring Frank Cross (a nasty network-TV executive) as Scrooge's cognate -- but only just so close.  The list of supporting characters is replete with cowering minions and big-name cameos -- Robert Mitchum, Karen Allen, Carol Kane, David ""Buster Poindexter"" Johansson, Bobcat Goldthwaite and Buddy Hackett among others.  The ghostly visits are entertwined with the plot device of a live TV production of ""A Christmas Carol"" of which Frank is in charge.  Pacing, witty script, truly memorable and funny characters, interesting effects and Murray's own sly comic sourness build up as the Three Ghosts create a comic/dramatic crescendo that should, by all rights, climax in a brilliantly Transformed Frank Cross.  Unfortunately, it is at this point that the film sputters to a barely believeable crawl as Murray breaks into a camera-hogging, unconvincing monologue on how good Christmas feels.  Not even Al Green and Annie Lennox's brilliant duet of ""Put A Little Love In Your Heart"" over the credits can rescue the overall weak denoument.  Still, the rest of the film is so good I am inclined at every viewing to overlook the slightly [weak] ending.  Certainly a cut above many efforts to modernize Scrooge, this is in no way a disappointing movie and could easily become a family standard, especially for Murray fans.  But for the real thing from start to finish (along with substantially more belly-laughs) I would recommend ""Groundhog Day"" as the seasonal balance to this bit of Christmas decor.",1044230400,11,1745,5.116197183098592

It updates the Dickens classic tale of a greedy, cynical businessman who is visited by three ghosts and ultimately ends up finding love and happiness. It's a pretty simple idea, but it's the execution of this that makes it so excellent;  by shifting the story to the comedy arena they gave it new life while maintaining the original point.
First of all, Murray's acting is well done. I can't even really explain the details... you just have to see him.
Second, the ghosts are excellent also. The Marley character is played by the former CEO, who appears to him in the office. The ghost of the ""Past"" is a crusty, obnoxious cab driver who drives Murray through time, starting with his sad childhood and into his 20s. The ghost of the ""Present"" is a pretty, but still obnoxious, fairy-type who likes to beat the crap out of him. And the ghost of the ""Future"" is, of course, a tall guy in a black cloak who gets his point across without saying a word.
You'll probably start off despising Murray's character, but by the end you'll be feeling pretty good having seen his transformation.

Little kids would be lost (and scared in a few scenes) and older kids would be bored by the inside and above their head jokes and the big corporation parodies.  I bring this up because made as a Christmas film, and loosely based on ""A Christmas Carol"" one might assume that this is a family movie.  Cleverly written and with some decent acting this dark comedy is mostly for a sophisticated audience that appreciates satire.  A recommendation for those that fit the bill and for Bill Murray fans.",1005955200,4,594,4.584905660377358
1060878,4,6305609764,"Bill Murray has never ceased to be one of my favorite comedians, from the first viewing of Ghostbusters to the outrageous role in The Man Who Knew Too Little. (He's also probably the only good part in Charlie's Angels, though I know most will disagree.) This film does not fail to further his career, in my opinion. It presented him as the crazed and vicious television company president who brings us an Ebenezer we can't ignore. Bob Goldthwait and Carol Kane do not fail to drive the audience bonkers either! Karen Allen is not AS convincing in her romantic role of Claire as she was as Marion in Raiders, but better than Laura in The Glass Menagerie. The humor is terrific in several parts (verbal and physical), yet the message of the film--the SERIOUS one--is not lost. This movie has made my Christmas for years, better than the two Home Alones! May I add, as an impending music doctorate, that Danny Elfman's score brings me joy with each viewing as well!",986515200,2,962,4.631578947368421

Hey, it sounds cool at first, I mean Groundhog's Day was one of the funniest movies I've seen, and Bill Murray is a great comedian. However, when I finally saw it, *gasp* it was horrible. It wasn't heartwarming, or funny at all, it's just plain MEAN! Murray is almost frighteningly unfunny. Beyond Murray's pathetic ramblings and pratfalls is a cast that looks like it's been drugged up. The casting doesn't work as well. Tiny Tim as a mute black kid? It just doesn't work. The movie limps along for about three quarters of the movie, and then it lays down and dies with 10 minutes to go. From then on is an unwatchable, incomprehensible rant from Bill Murray that goes on and on, and then the movie just ends with a thud, or maybe that was my jaw dropping.",978220800,10,822,4.450331125827814

Sure, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it's not, but the casting and the characters are great, and the contemporary setting makes it more accesible to younger generations.  While it may not have the thematic impact of other takes on the classic tale, the message of the importance of brotherhood is illustrated throughout via Murray's character's interactions.  And let's face it, Bill Murray is a really funny guy at this point in his career.",977443200,,504,4.976190476190476
1060929,4,6305609764,"Bill Murray lends his comedic talents to this contemporary version of the Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol,"" with somewhat skewered results in ""Scrooged,"" directed by Richard Donner from a screenplay by Mitch Glazer and Michael O' Donoghue.  This time around, Ebenezer is one Frank Cross (Murray), programming executive for a major television network with an office in New York.  Above all else, Cross covets the ""ratings"" he can add to his coffers, and this year he's going all out with a ""live"" broadcast of ""A Christmas Carol"" planned for Christmas Eve, starring Buddy Hackett as Scrooge and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.  And that's just a taste of the kind of humor this film has to offer.  There's more, much more, and it's all handled with aplomb by Donner, Murray and a great supporting cast.  Whatever genre he's working in, Donner knows his stuff and knows how to deliver the goods.  Here he wisely lets Murray lead the way, but keeps his star on task and the film moving along with a tempered pace and great timing.  The story remains the same, but placing Scrooge-- Cross-- in the entertainment industry was a stroke of genius, and it all works exceedingly well, as it gives the audience a medium with which it can readily identify.  Let's face it, television is a part of our culture, like it or not, and it's here to stay; and in this instance, using it as a setting for this story offers a ""tableau vivant"" rich with possibilities that are tapped to the fullest.  There's a promo for the upcoming live broadcast like you've never seen before; there's the ""inside"" industry jokes, like Network executive Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum) urging programming for cats; ""Marley's ghost"" becomes Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) the exec who sold his soul for ratings; the casting of Hackett and Retton; but most of all, it puts Murray right in his element.  Murray gets right to the heart of the character, imbuing Cross with a sense of jaded, dubious and sarcastic paranoia that so perfectly fits the psychological make-up of an executive in a business where you're only as good as yesterday's ratings.  And Murray plays him to the hilts; he has the tone and the body language, and nobody can look ""askance"" like he can, a nuance he makes the most of here.  it's an original take on a familiar character, and in Murray's skin Cross becomes a memorable and entirely believable figure, from his credible ruthlessness (he fires an underling, Eliot Loudermilk--played by Bob Goldthwait-- just before Christmas for disagreeing with his ""vision"") to his epiphany on Christmas Eve.  The terrific supporting cast includes Karen Allen as Claire, the girl Frank lets slip away as he follows the siren's song of career; John Glover (Bryce Cummings) as Frank's new ""assistant,"" plotting his way to the top; Alfre Woodard (Grace) as Frank's secretary, a single mom with a sick child; Michael J. Pollard (Herman); Nicholas Phillips (Calvin); John Murray (James); Brian Doyle-Murray (Earl Cross); David Johansen, as the cab-driving Ghost of Christmas Past; and Carol Kane, who turns in an unforgettable, hilarious, scene-stealing  performance as the Ghost of Christmas Present.  There's plenty of laughs and some touching moments in ""Scrooged,"" which is a wonderfully entertaining holiday treat, especially if you want your ""Christmas Carol"" served up just a little bit differently this year.  And the speech Murray gives at the end, once he's had his revelation, is worth the price of admission alone; it's one of those things Murray does best, and he really connects with the audience, especially when he finishes up by leading everyone involved (including the audience) in song.  This is a movie that has become an annual event for many since it's arrival on video;  give yourself a present this year and put this one under your tree.  You'll be glad you did.  Like the song at the end (sung by Annie Lennox and Al Green), it'll ""Put A Little Love In Your Heart.""",976060800,20,3963,4.913043478260869
1060930,5,6305609764,"This is on the top of my favorite Christmas movies since I was a child perhaps even my favorite comedy of all time. This was an unusual movie. Although a comedy it had a certain seriousness about it. I think it had to do with a beautifully haunting score by Danny Elfman (my favorite work of Danny Elfman, too bad they don't make the entire score on cd) It is totally funny through out the picture. We laugh at how crude and nasty Bill Murray acts toward others because he is so funny the way he does things (like the part where he steals a cab from an old lady by tricking her and once in the car he gives her the bird). It is laugh out loud humor not just chuckles. But as it comes towar the ending we see how serious being mean can be. This is when Danny Elfman's score really gets your heart.

In ""Scrooged,"" director Richard Donner knows to keep Murray as smarmy as possible for as long as  possible. Playing network exec Frank Cross, Murray has a field day just  being mean. He even gets to fire Bobcat Goldthwait on Christmas Eve! Who  among us hasn't wanted to do that?
This retelling of Dickens' most famous  work stays true to the original while bringing it into the present. Michael  J. Pollard and Carole Kane turn in memorable performances. But come on...  Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim?",965001600,3,598,4.757281553398058
1060933,5,6305609764,"Now, more than ever, it is important to remember the TRUE meaning of Christmas! Don't miss Bill Murray's immortal classic Scrooged. You're life might just depend on it.

Christmas Specials are a big deal, with some of them (such as Charlie Brown and The Grinch) going down in TV history. When it comes to story a lot of lazy staff writers just milk the Christmas Carol goat and there are millions of different takes out there to prove it with Roseanne and the original Star Trek series all doing their own rip-offs. IBC boss Frank Cross (Bill Murray dressed up as Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) is a delightfully wicked man of hate who is planning his very own live broadcast of said story. Little does he know that very tale is about to wind its way into his life.

I like Frank Cross is because he's a lot like me. He's mean to those beneath him, yields power with a ruthless swagger, and is sarcastic to just about everyone. If you disagree with him in even the slightest, tiniest little way he'll fire you. Just like I would. But on this certain Xmas Eve life is getting very weird for him.

The owner of the station is doubting his abilities to undertake such a heavy production, a slimy Californian director is trying to muscle-in on his job and his dead boss comes back to haunt him. He brings an important message that if he doesn't change his way he's going to hell and that three ghosts, of Xmas past, present and future, are going to show him the results of his evilness.

In the hands of just another comedy director this would have been a missed opportunity, but Richard Donner shoots the film as a supernatural fantasy and gives it a pretty superior shine. Something Brian Levant could never do. And let's not forget Bill Murray, the guy is a genius no matter what he does and he dominates the whole film with his loud an maniacal performance. Everything he says seems to be ad-libbed and babbles some brilliant one-liners and sarcasm.

Most people are put-off by the ending and claim that when the nastiness stops and sentiment kicks in the film goes downhill. I don't feel this way. In a world where Xmas is commercialized and the time of year where people go in huge debt we need a constant reminder of what we should be feeling. No one is asking you to celebrate the fact that Wal-Mart are selling cheap turkeys or that greedy stores have a limited stock of $700 PlayStations. At the end Frank Cross, the world's biggest scrooge and non-believer, tells us that it's the fun, the determination to make a difference, the easiness of changing someone's life and the spirit of the holiday season that really matters. You don't have to hate it, and if you surrender your pride and just give it a go then maybe the miracle to happen to you to.

For me, Scrooged has been an annual tradition for years and will continue to be so. Not only is it very funny but, in its own way, very important. If you give a little, you can get back a whole lot more. Sounds corny, I know but Xmas is what you make it. And you only get a small amount so it's best to make every one count. This movie is a step in the right direction.

The Blu-ray looks great in 1.78:1 1080p. It's hard to believe this film was made in 1988. The DTS HD-MA sound is also an improvement on DVD. Extras are barely existent, which is a shame considering that Paramount planned then cancelled  (for reasons unknown) a special edition back in 2006.",957830400,3,3427,4.445859872611465
