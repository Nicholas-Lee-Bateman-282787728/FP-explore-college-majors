5585332,4,B00BEIYM42,"""Unfinished Song"" (2013 release from the UK where it showed as ""Song For Marion""; 93 min.) brings the story of Marion (played by Vanessa Redgrave) and Arthur (played by Terence Stamp), a long-time married couple where Marion is the cheerful and eternally optimistic wife and Arthur is the grumpy old husband (when asked if he is enjoying himself, Arthur grumbles ""you know how I feel about enjoying things!""). Marion attends the local community center to sing in a choir of similar seniors. Then one day Marion collapses and we learn that she has terminal cancer (the doctor tells her ""eat all the chips and ice cream you want!""). In a parallel storyline, we see Arthur also struggling mightly in his relationship with his son Steve and 8 yr. old granddaughter Jennifer. Meanwhile, the choir, lead by a young woman named Elizabeth (played by Gemma Arterton), is getting ready for the singing competition they have entered. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie. How will things turn out for Marion and Arthur? Can Arthur mend the fences with his son? Will the choir break through in the singing competition? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turs out.

Several comments: first and foremost, I was struck by the similarities in themes between this movie and ""Quartet"", the Dustin Hoffman-directed British movie from late last year: the soothing, if not healing, powers of both music and companionship for elderly folks. Second, you will see a side of Vanessa Redgrave that you have not seen before (not to mention that Redgrave, now in her mid-70s, remains as active as ever). Third, THE break-out performance of the movie for me is Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of a British version of Anna Kendrick. Arterton is an up-and-coming talent, the last of which we have not yet seen (she was most recently in ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" and later this year she'll be in ""Byzantium"").

The screening I saw this at here in my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati this weekend was packed, heavily tilting towards seniors, I might add, and they absolutely loved this movie, laughing out loud many time (for example, when the choir started doing the 'robot dance') and even giving an applause as the end credits started to roll. This is a fine movie for sure, but for me lacking a bit in originality. That said, if you loved ""Quartet"", you cannot go wrong with ""Unfinished Song"".",1373760000,2,2463,4.806603773584905
5585333,5,B00BEIYM42,"This excellent film is about the healing power of music being the key to unlocking expressions of feelings, even in advanced age. The superb British cast performs beautifully, with a masterful, curmudgeonly Terrance Stamp, Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Eccleston and Gemma Arterton as the vulnerable young music teacher who gives joy and meaning to the lives of her aged choir. Even if the ending is somewhat predictable, it still packs a wallop, with not a dry eye in the theater. Great actors, understated plotting, sensitive direction by Paul Andrew Williams, intelligent dialogue. Highly recommended!",1373587200,5,604,5.505376344086022
5585334,4,B00BEIYM42,"What a joy it is to see consummate actors of the calibre of Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp on the big screen. And while they may not be the youthful handsome and beautiful actors we remember from ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" and ""Camelot,"" they remind us that, yes, there is still a beauty in old age. (Watching this film, I was reminded that the great photographer Imogene Cunningham published near the end of her life-- I believe she was at least 90-- beautiful photographs of old people.)

Stamp as Arthur and Redgrave as his wife Marion play two characters in the twilight of their lives and are in a word, brilliant. But Gemma Arterton as Elizabeth, the music teacher, and Christopher Eccleston as Arthur and Marion's son James give outstanding performances as well. (The tension between Arthur and his son James is palpable. And the friendship that develops between the old Arthur and the young Elizabeth is one of the pluses of the film.) The plot is simple and could have been washed out to the British sea by a lesser director (Paul Andrew Williams directs) and less than stellar acting as the actors carry the film. (Elizabeth gets a group of seniors ready to perform heavy metal music for a contest.)

I went to see this movie with some trepidation since the rumors I had heard were that it was a tearjerker and I had heard the words ""too sentimental"" bandied about. I worried in vain. Of course there are sad moments in this movie-- to experience Terence Stamp singing Billy Joel's ""Llullabye (Goodnight, my Angel)"" will make you tear up and is worth the price of admission to the movie-- but there are scenes that will make your smile as well. According to the MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY, the definition of ""sentimental"" is (a)""marked or governed by feeling"" and (b) ""resulting from feeling rather than reason."" Isn't this why we weep at funerals and feel overwhelming sadness when sons and daughters go off to fight in foreign lands? It is all about being human. Or as the late Celestine Sibley, a columnist for the ATLANTA CONSTITUTION once said, sometimes life will make you cry.",1373414400,20,2099,4.747945205479452
5585335,5,B00BEIYM42,"I saw this film yesterday at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia (coordinated by the Philadelphia Film Society). I truly enjoyed it. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't list the two actors with major roles and well-known names - Terrence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave - in the main listing. But no big deal.

The film is basically a fictional version of the documentary ""Young @ Heart"" which came out a few years ago. (If you liked that film, you'll enjoy this as well.)It's about a group of British senior citizens who enter a choral competition by singing rock and heavy metal songs. It's funny and heartwarming. There is a serious back-story too which adds to the enjoying. And the music is great with Stamp performing a Billy Joel song and Celine Dion crooning a new Diane Warren-penned song over the closing credits.

I'll certainly await the DVD of this film to see what ""bonus features"" they added.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5585450,4,B00BEIYM42,"Don't go looking for originality in Paul Andrew Williams's film.  The plot recycles a familiar thematic chestnut: a curmudgeonly pensioner Arthur (Terence Stamp) resents his wife Marion's (Vanessa Redgrave's) participation in a pensioners' choir, especially as she is dying from cancer.  When she passes away, Arthur shuts himself away from everyone, but with the encouragement of choir-master Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton), he rediscovers his ability to sing.  The choir make it through to the finals of a competition, but they are about to be excluded on the grounds of being a laughing-stock compared to the other, more sophisticated entrants.  Arthur makes a last-minute entrance, strides on to the stage, sings a song accompanied by the choir, and they end up finishing third.

More recent variations on this story have included ONE CHANCE, the story of BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT winner Paul Potts with James Corden (2014).  In Williams's film the two protagonists don't have to do much other than provide contrasting characterizations: the perpetually scowling Stamp set against the more optimistically inclined Marion.  There is one memorable sequence where she refuses to talk to him unless he accedes to her wishes.

What makes the film touching is the way in which Williams handles his subject-matter.  He does not shy away from the idea that cancer is a killer; however much we like to pretend otherwise, Marion's death is imminent.  Having one's partner cruelly taken away after years of happy marriage is traumatic, as it proves for Arthur - especially as he cannot seem to get on with his son James (Christopher Eccleston).  A group of OAPs in a choir singing Motorhead might seem incongruous, but the experience gives them a renewed belief in life.

The film makes some telling visual contrasts between the prison-like suburban life Arthur follows, and the beauties of the sky above.  As he watches the sun rise and set, he understands how there are far more important things in life than sitting in the house.  Marion looks down upon him from the heavens; and it's his duty to honor her.

It's a clich to say that films like this are life-enhancing, but A SONG FOR MARION proves the truth of this statement.",1447545600,,2215,5.0467032967032965

5585552,3,B00BEIYM42,"Whats it about?

Arthur, a stereotypically cantankerous old man with a complete aversion to fun learns to cope with the death of his wife, Marion, while mending the strained relationship with his son and carrying on Marions legacy at the local choir club. Think Glee but with old people.

What did I think?

From beginning to end, Song for Marion is as clichd and predictable as it comes.  If it weren't for Stamp, Redgrave (and even Arterton), this movie would have fallen completely into the dark abyss of mediocrity. Its a shame they did not have a huge amount of material to work with and much of the plot seemed to be dragged out and made to appear larger than what it was.  It lacked the impact it should have had but the sincere performances and one particular solo still managed to move me to manly tears (a fact that I will strongly deny).",1423958400,2,848,4.48051948051948

But love overcomes his resistance. The young woman who leads the singing group reaches out to him and an unlikely friendship develops.

Superb acting by all the cast, especially Gemma Arterton as a choir teacher who works with youth by day, and seniors in the evenings.  Gemma Arterton has a very wide range as an actress and is versatile.  In Hansel and Gretel she was a tough witch slayer.  In Unfinished Song she is a tender and compassionate person.

Incredible talent in all the actors.  The plot is well written and engaging.  The pace moves along at a good speed.  The music is outstanding.  The filming is nice.  The directing is top notch with subtly effective scenes and themes.

I so much want to tell you what it is about, but I fear I would spoil it. I do have to say it is EXTREMELY moving, so tender hearted, deeply meaningful and by the end of it I was sobbing...not with despair but I could feel the triumph so profoundly. It was one of those messy, goppy, bawling types of cries too that left me with a puffy face and a deep abiding love for the song originated by Billy Joel, ""Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)"".

I saw this movie a month ago and when I give a movie a ""5 STAR RATING"" it's for a few reasons...when a movie touches my heart and makes me feel happy and sad (sadness is part of life...so it's a feeling that I believe can enlighten us to realize ""life is precious...DON'T WASTE A MOMENT!).  Social redeeming qualities are essential...and this movie has it!  There's laughter, crying, a bit of anger which happens in families...or it can be deemed a disappointed feeling which seems to look like anger...nevertheless, it's what everyone experiences at some point...but these kind of things are sometimes essential so people can learn from them!  And there's joy and compassion which is a great foundation for all the characters in this movie.  Life is a circle and this movie has much to offer!  The music is fun and I'll bet if you give it a whirl, you'll enjoy this movie and will want to watch it more than once! Vanessa Redgrave is one of my favorites...I actually saw her in person in Boston in a building of law firms where I worked in 1984...she and I passed each other in the lobby...IT WAS AMAZING!!!

5585731,5,B00BEIYM42,"Lovely. Lovely. Lovely ... I absolutely adore this movie, written and directed with tremendous heart by Paul Andrew Williams, and have viewed it several times now.  It seems I cannot get enough of this well put together story about Arthur (Terence Stamp) and his wife, Marion (Vanessa Redgrave).  While he goes the way of the grouch, the seeming curmudgeon most of the time, and also the one that is difficult to get along with, Marion goes the completely other direction.  She spends the small amount of time that she has left very well, she sings along with her friends in a community choir.  They are practicing for an upcoming competition, including a solo from Marion, being what she is, a physically and emotionally giving person.  You may recognize some of her fellow singers, as I saw some familiar faces in the choir.  At the end of the film, we are delighted by a couple of musical treats, although they are quite emotional to get through, they are heartwarming and so worth it.

The choir instructor, Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton, 'Pirate Radio'), definitely has her challenges with Arthur, who never wishes to ever give an inch as far as the health of his wife goes.  He wants to make sure he controls everything, doesn't want to loosen that taut grip.  Hey, if you hold on hard enough, apply each and every ounce of your strength, then the something you are holding on to can never leave; Right?  Elizabeth is great with how she handles the first very gruff, Arthur.  She is a miracle in disguise for the up and coming adjustment he must make, and, also, helps with his estranged son, James (Christopher Eccleston), whom Arthur doesn't ever have much time for, but must start including in his life.

This musical group is full of the elderly sect, and they choose one eclectic list of songs to sing.  This was the absolute first time that I viewed, and heard, the elderly rock out to Motorhead's, 'Ace of Spades', and then also, Salt-N-Pepa's 'Let's Talk About Sex'.  While singing may be the venue that brings around all of this activity and emotion, it is the wonderful acting of this theme which is in no way new, just different.  Everyone is there for their parts and spot-on with their character portrayals, bringing a film together that will definitely target your sensitive side and have you scooping up the Kleenex.

For Marion and Arthur; the music competition, the loss of the one most loved, the solo that may go unsung, and all the emotions of what we cannot escape in this metaphorical, ""Unfinished Song"".",1401667200,5,2528,4.724373576309795

Gemma Arterton, Christopher Eccleston surely deserve their place on the mantle, but this film is about these four actors.

Two other things about the film of note:

Gemma Arterton - This classically beautiful British girl is in top form here.

I love old people and enjoy listening to them....not many people are patient enough to listen to them. This is a turn-around decision I came to when I lost my Dad 23 years ago. Floods of memories filled my heart and I realized I had waited too late to do the things I had all planned out to do with him, like sit down to hear him talk about himself, his childhood, etc. I since promised to enjoy the company of all the elderly friends (my new mothers and fathers) I've been privileged to make over the years.

5585782,4,B00BEIYM42,"It is too bad that this film 'Unfinished Song' came out so late in the game. With the other UK films of baby boomers already seen, this is a bit redundant. That said, the performances by Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave make up for any lessing.

Marion, played by Vanessa Redgrave, has a terminal disease and intends to live her life fully. Her husband, Arthur, as played by Terence Stamp, has always been stoic, no fun, Arthur. Marion is the only one who seems to understand Arthur. Marion loves to sing with her pensioner's group, her friends are there. Arthur drops her by and then leaves or stays outside and smokes. He cares for her, all by himself, he wants to do the controlling. They have a son and a granddaughter, but Arthur never seemed to get on with the boy. As time goes by we get to know the members of the choir, and the young woman leading it. This is a story well told, but it does fall into the dramatic fold. However, I wouldn't really know because tears were streaming.

A lovely British film with a lot to say. It has been said before and is not new, that is why I assume the film did not hit the big time. But for those of us who enjoy these films, it is a winner. I loved the cast, recognize a few faces in the choir, and would love to see this turned into a series. What could be better than old senior farts singing their hearts out?

5585930,5,B00BEIYM42,"The great Vanessa Redgrave heads an outstanding cast in this sad story of two elderly people coming to terms with death and dying.  Vanessa is wonderful as Marion, sick and dying, but determined to live her life to the fullest until the end.  She is part of a chorus of elderly people at a senior center who are preparing to enter a competition.  Her group is led by the young and enthusiastic Gemma Atherton, Elizabeth in the film.  Marion's husband Arthur, again in another fine performance by Terrence Stamp, is a bit of a curmudgeon.  Arthur sings quite well himself, but would prefer to hide his talent and instead stands sternly in the background watching Marion and the chorus.

At home Arthur cares tenderly for Marion as we watch her slow decline.  She never gives in to her illness or gives up living as fully as she can.  The great power of this film is that we quickly come to care for Marion and Arthur.  They are good people who have been dealt a difficult hand and they play it as best they can.  At first come our tears when the inevitable happens to Marion, but then we watch with joy as Arthur learns how to resume living.  Encouraged by director Gemma, who hears him sing and recognizes his talent, Arthur joins the chorus.

Some will say that the ending is predictable, but I didn't care.  I cheered for Arthur and was happy for him as he put his life back together after a devastating loss.  The story starts out as an ""Unfinished Song;"" Marion did not get a chance to be with her mates at the chorus competition.  But when Arthur is standing on stage singing his heart out, we know that this story ends with hope and courage.  Yes, death claims everyone in the end, but as Marion would say, it is how we live each day that counts -- never, never giving up.  Laughter and tears, hope and despair, life and death are all part of the ""unfinished song"" that is everyone's life.  See this film; you won't be disappointed.",1384300800,2,1938,4.441926345609065

It is even more relevant if you (recently) lost a parent or two, particularly to cancer (been there done that). The entire movie was not a tear jerker, it got there non-the-less.

5585981,4,B00BEIYM42,"Unfinished Song is filled with a predictable and emotionally manipulative material, handled with such grace and dignity by the cast and director that I was constantly surprised by the film's ability to move me. Utilizing music and melodrama in such a way that is never overwrought or exaggerated for effect, Unfinished Song is mild entertainment which creeps up on you in profoundly unexpected ways. Even the supporting characters feel very natural, making it very difficult to notice when anyone is ""acting.""

  Terence Stamp heads up the cast as Arthur, a cranky old man who has become accustomed to his habits and routines with the only person he opens up to, his wife (Vanessa Redgrave). When cancer threatens to take that foundation from Arthur, she suddenly joins an elderly singing group. Arthur is pulled into the group, finding solace in the friendship of the group's young teacher, Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton). Unfinished Song is a film about grief, but manages to keep a light touch on the material.

  The music in Unfinished Song is simple but effective, never appearing too polished or unbelievable. There is more heart than talent in the voices, but that works wonders for the sincerity of the film's story. We are not meant to be blown away by the vocal abilities, but instead get swept up in the openness with which they sing their song.

5585984,5,B00BEIYM42,"UNFINISHED SONG is a beautifully executed, British-made film that will make you cry.  Though it deals with death and loss, writer/director Paul Andrew Williams' film ultimately celebrates life.

Arthur (Terence Stamp) and Marion (Vanessa Redgrave) have been married ""forever"".  They are total opposites.  He's an old grouch, devoted to her, but who is practically estranged from his grown son (Christopher Eccleston).  She, on the other hand, has a warm, outgoing personality.  Sadly, her doctor has told her that she only has a few weeks to live.

Marion is a member of a spirited local singing group for senior citizens, led by Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton), a young and charming music teacher.  Arthur wants nothing to do with the aging choir, but he aids his wife's participation in order to placate her.  Then, she passes away...and all he has is Elizabeth's friendship and the choir.

The actors in this touching drama are uniformly magnificent.

The DVD, released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, contains several deleted scenes and outtakes.

5585985,4,B00BEIYM42,"""Unfinished Song"" (alternate title ""Song for Marion"") revolves around a grumpy 72-year-old pensioner Arthur Harris (Terence Stamp), whose outgoing wife Marion (Vanessa Redgrave) is a member of a senior citizen choir OAPZ led by a music teacher Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton). They have a son James (Christopher Eccleston), but his relationship with his father is a little strained.

Elizabeth's ragtag choir enters a local competition, where Marion will sing a solo, but it is discovered that her cancer has returned after a remission.

Written and directed by Paul Andrew Williams (""London to Brighton""), ""Unfinished Song"" benefits from the impressive performances of the leads that almost make up for the predictable storyline and a rather flat supporting cast.

Like a Massachusetts chorus in a wonderful documentary ""Young at Heart"" (it's a must), the OAPZ's repertoire includes a variety of types of music from ""Nowhere to Run"" (Martha and the Vandellas) to ""Ace of Spades"" (Motrhead) and ""Let's Talk about Sex"" (Salt-N-Pepa).

Perhaps the film could have made more use of the music scenes, though I know this is basically a story about Arthur, who would choose to wait outside the building where his wife is practicing. A bit too sentimental as it is, ""Unfinished Song"" is worth watching for the fine performances from the veteran actors.",1375056000,2,1340,5.247663551401869

Not to spoil it, this plot of this movie about music providing a source of calm and healing. Redgrave and Stamp play a married couple. Redgrave the jollier, Stamp a grump.
