752373,4,6303943004,"If you've visited either of the Disney worlds,you've no doubt experienced ""The Pirates Of The Caribbean""---well,here is it's motion picture counterpart---every bit as artificial as Disney's indoor sail through  pirate waters. I'm convinced this movie was the direct forerunner and  inspiration for the ride,as they're both deliberatly overblown and  kid-friendly. Zanuck conceived ""The Black Swan"" as a schoolboy  pirate adventure from the beginning---the opening scenes announce as  much. Whereas the Errol Flynns functioned as straight period drama,this one  casts a wink toward the audience from the first reel on---even Power's own  ""Son Of Fury"",released within the same year,managed an intensity  never approached by ""The Black Swan"".I remember waiting with  great anticipation back around 1980 when it resurfaced on the old ""SFM  Holiday Network"" after having been years out of circulation(except for  a few scattered B/W prints in 16mm).It seemed a letdown then,and compared  with ""The Mark Of Zorro"" and ""Son Of Fury"",it frankly  still is---yet somehow,""The Black Swan""  seems to gain on  repeated viewings,and for that reason,I'd recommend it as a video  keeper. Two elements alone justify owning it---the color and Alfred Newman's  score. Otherwise,there is a miscast George Sanders---I know it's hard to  imagine G.S. as an unwelcome participant in ANY film,but he's just too  urbane for the athletic excesses he's put through here(George was notorious  for ducking stunt work)---and that flaming red beard too often conceals the  beloved Sanders sneer we know to lie beneath it---this one's clearly among  his early ""take-the-money-and-run"" parts. Director Henry King was  ideally suited for Americana subjects(see the wonderful ""Margie""  and ""Wait Till The Sun Shines,Nellie""),but was versatile enough  to hoist the Jolly Roger if necessary,though you can tell he'd rather be  doing something else. Maureen O'Hara's the usual spitfire(she even got  around to playing a character named Spitfire a few years later with Errol  Flynn)---you start to wonder why these guys put up with so much aggravation  to get at her---then that fadeout clinch,surprising for a code pic,comes  along to remind you. She and Power also do a bed-time variation on the old  ""It Happened One Night"" gag that is actually the most suspenseful  scene in the show. Don't get your hopes up for a ""Zorro"" worthy  climactic duel---here it's undercranked and ludicrous---almost like running  a silent at the wrong speed. Tyrone Power was peeling potatoes by the time  this got into theatres---he'd never look so frisky again---even in similar  post-war projects,it was clear the party was over---just compare  ""Swan"" with ""Captain From Castile""---same  star,color,director,composer---but now the milk had curdled,and a noirish  malaise had definetely set in. Power may have looked back on the ""Black  Swan""(s) of his past as childish unworthies(or ""monuments to  public patience"" as he liked to call them),but this was the sort of  vehicle that took him to the top,and would have kept him there,had the war  and his own displacement by newer faces not occured(think Burt Lancaster  and ""The Crimson Pirate"",virtually a remake of ""The Black  Swan"").In a sense,it's Power's own swan song as the impossibly  handsome matinee idol---a status he would soon exchange for a marine  uniform,and never really get back.",952992000,5,3391,5.495145631067961
752374,5,6303943004,"Being a fan of Hollywood`s classic swashbucklers of the silent and early sound era, this is probably the ultimate pirate adventure complete with sea battles, grim pirates, lush tropical Carribean settings, romance and the  ultimate hero Mr. Tyrone Power himself, even topping Douglas Fairbanks and  Errol Flynn in this movie. Made by Hollywood veteran Henry King, it boasts  an excellent cast, a good score, high production values and captures the  spirit of pirate movies perfectly, especially because shot in Technicolor.  Certainly Tyrone Powers best movie that makes him a worthy follower to  Fairbanks and Flynn. Great fun!!",928281600,15,629,5.43298969072165

752513,5,6303943004,"I do love this movie. You can't view it with a modern sensibility though, because Tyrone Power essentially falls in love at first sight with a woman (Maureen O'Hara) who hates him (and tells him so repeatedly and bluntly) and is moreover engaged to another man. Nevertheless, he pursues her, literally kidnaps her, and in the end she of course falls in love with him. All that aside, if you're looking for a classic pirate adventure, you won't go wrong here. Power and O'Hara both seem to be having a rollicking good time, and there's some wonderful scenery chewing by Laird Cregar as Captain Henry Morgan. Just don't analyze the subtext too much.",1493683200,,647,4.734513274336283

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The long-simmering conflict between Britain and Spain has at long last come to an end, and it looks like much the same can be said of piracy on the high seas. The infamous pirate Henry Morgan [Laird Cregar] not only defied death but has been knighted, promising to rid the Atlantic of his former comrades-in-arms on his way to the governorship of Jamaica. He offers his friends a regal pardon and a hundred acres of land a piece if they hang up their Jolly Rogers once and for all. If they don't, well...they'll be staring down the same hangman's noose that Henry Morgan somehow escaped. Captain Jamie Waring [Tyrone Power], himself recently on the wrong side of a Spanish torture rack, eagerly sets sail alongside his long-time friend. Not much of anyone else shares Captain Jamie Waring's enthusiasm. Too many other pirates, among them Captain Billy Leech [George Sanders] and Wogan [Anthony Quinn], sneer at Henry Morgan as one of the king's spies. The residents of Jamaica are even more leery, suspicious that Morgan and his men could ever give up their wicked ways. They're desperate for Henry Morgan and the hangman to face each other once again, and if they have to feed the likes of Billy Leech inside information about well-stocked ships to raid and embarrass their unwelcomed new governor, then that's just what they'll do. Oh, and if preening English gentleman Roger Ingram [Edward Ashley] rakes a captain's share of the loot in the process, all the better. Unfortunately for Morgan, Ingram's ploy works all too well, and every effort thus far to hunt down Leech and company have been stymied.

Facing another cry for impeachment, Henry Morgan sends his best man after Leech in one final, desperate attempt to prove himself worthy of his governorship. Jamie Waring is up to the challenge but has to make one quick pit stop first, stopping to see Lady Margaret [Maureen O'Hara]. It's not enough of a humiliation that Henry Morgan replaced her father as governor or that Jamie Waring is now sleeping in her former bedchamber, but Margaret is dragged kicking and screaming onto a ship by a man she finds utterly repulsive...and on the eve of her wedding to Ingram, no less! Everything seems to be going Jamie Waring's way. He's finally gotten his hands on the girl of his dreams, even if Lady Margaret wants to stab her kidnapper in his sleep. He discovers who the traitor is that's trading privileged information to Leech, and at long last, he even tracks down his former brother in piracy. The only downside is that this all happens at the same time, and Jamie Waring doesn't stand a chance. The ships of Jamie Waring's enemies outclass his in speed and firepower, so he can't run, and he can't fight. Like they say, though, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That charade buys Jamie Waring a little time, sure, but that's destined to leave him staring down even more cannons than before...

More than seventy years later, `The Black Swan' remains an infectiously fun swashbuckler. Boasting an 85 minute running time and a screenplay by Ben Hecht [Notorious and His Girl Friday], among others, the film is remarkably lean and uncluttered. `The Black Swan' is bookended by sprawling sequences of swordplay, moments made that much more frenetic by speeding them up a touch. Though filmed on a soundstage rather than the high seas, its massive models remain surprisingly convincing these many decades later, heightened by the breath-taking Technicolor cinematography of Leon Shamroy. Though Leon Shamroy was the only member of the film's cast and crew to take home a statuette, Alfred Newman was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his rousing, high adventure score. As far as the premise goes, there's just something I find endlessly engaging about pirates trying to make good despite the best efforts of supposed gentlemen with no moral character. It's fast, it's breezy, it's thrilling, and a cast with the likes of Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara on the bill ensures that `The Black Swan' is almost always a joy to watch. Tyrone Power would go on to further costume epics, such as Captain From Castile, Prince of Foxes and The Black Rose, yet none of these were able to match the sheer swagger, splendour or pictorial beauty of 'The Black Swan.'

Sadly, another historical spectacle proved to be Tyrone Power's last performance, because in September 1958, Tyrone Power and his wife Deborah went to Madrid and Valdespartera in Spain to film the epic Solomon and Sheba, to be directed by King Vidor. On the afternoon of November 15, 1942, he filmed a scene with George Sanders as the villain, in which the two performed a duel with broadswords. Tyrone Power had filmed about 75 percent of his scenes, when he was stricken with a massive heart attack while filming a duelling scene with his frequent co-star and friend, George Sanders. He died en route to the hospital on Saturday, November 15, 1958 and he was only 44. He was aware of his heart condition; in fact it was shortly before leaving for Spain that he did a film for the American Heart Association in which he warned of the dangers of exertion and said ""time is the most precious thing we have."" Solomon and Sheba was the kind of film that demanded physical effort, a costume epic with much action; Tyrone Power was the kind of actor who loathed letting a double do what he felt he could do himself.

Of course, the downside of a film swirling around reformed pirates is that the middle stretch of the film is disappointingly light on action, and far less of `The Black Swan' is set on sea than one might expect. I certainly wouldn't have minded at least one more battle somewhere in the middle; the closest it comes is the blink-and-you-miss-it siege on the Prince Consort, literally ending in seconds. The middle act is dominated by Jamie Waring's infatuation with Lady Margaret, and there's a reason I hesitate to use the word 'romance'. Lady Margaret can barely stomach the sight of this overly persistent and not altogether charming pirate, and though she inevitably falls for the man who kidnapped her as the film draws to a close, her swooning abruptly comes out of nowhere. As much as I enjoy `The Black Swan,' it just doesn't approach the heights of Errol Flynn's most memorable swashbucklers. Not quite a classic but still a great deal of fun and you will get very rewarded in purchasing this stunning Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `The Black Swan' arrives on Blu-ray at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and its 1080p image quality devours most every available byte on this single layer disc. Despite the original camera negative having been lost for decades, the levels of clarity and fine detail showcased on this disc are often startling. Its fine, filmic texture has been faithfully preserved on Blu-ray, afforded a healthy bitrate to ensure that the grain is rendered as accurately as possible. Contrast is, at its best, robust enough to inspire a convincing sense of depth and dimensionality. There is essentially nothing in the way of wear or damage to intrude. No excessive filtering, artificial sharpening, or awkward digital manipulation ever rear their heads either. Its reproduction of The Black Swan's Technicolor photography, described by actress Maureen O'Hara and film historian Rudy Behlmer in the disc's audio commentary as being painterly and impressionistic in approach, is more problematic. In the early moments of the film, flesh tones are uneven, sometimes coming across as claylike. The faux-tropical sets uncomfortably alternate between lush, vivid foliage and sickly, pale greens. The original Technicolor elements for `The Black Swan' were almost certainly junked by Fox in the 1970s, saddling the team behind this presentation with a heavily faded single-strip source. Given the severe limitations of what 20th Century Fox was left to work with, what they've accomplished with this Blu-ray release borders on miraculous. Still, it will forever remain a crushing disappointment that short-sighted and poorly implemented decisions from forty years ago prevent us from fully appreciating these films as they were originally meant to be seen.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `The Black Swan' boasts a 24-bit 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio monaural soundtrack that leaves little room for complaint. The hiss lurking in the background is too mild to pose any sort of distraction, and there are no clicks, pops, or dropouts to tear viewers away from the swashbuckling adventure. The audio is respectably clean and clear, and dynamic range isn't limited to any greater extent than anticipated. Not exceptional but in no way disappointing. Also offered are Dolby Digital monaural dubs in French and Spanish. Subtitles are limited to English SDH, Spanish and French.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Rudy Behlmer and Maureen O'Hara: This has been carried over from the previous DVD release and is a feature-length conversation between actress Maureen O'Hara and film historian Rudy Behlmer. It's an extremely charming interview reflecting on Maureen O'Hara's career and the Golden Age of Hollywood, although The Black Swan really isn't the central focus. Maureen O'Hara does speak about The Black Swan's cinematography, colour testing, makeup, swordplay, effects work, legendary studio brass, and co-stars, though her comments are often in more general terms and largely about the way films from this era were made overall. There are brief notes about how drastically this film diverges from Raphael Sabatini's novel and how the ending was replaced, but neither Rudy Behlmer nor Maureen O'Hara touches on how the end product differs. I would have liked to have heard more about the production of The Black Swan in particular, but I found myself hopelessly won over by O'Hara's kinship with other Irish actors, such stories as the actress yanking her stolen mink coat off a lapdog, and later being in a position to put an alarm clock on top of the camera to indicate when she's leaving for the day, even if she were in the middle of a take. A terrific and very worthwhile listen and was well worth hearing Maureen O'Hara telling us how Tyrone Power and her good self would sneak off the have their favourite ice cream and in doing so got back late to the studio and got a good telling off by Darryl F. Zanuck.

Theatrical Trailer [1942] [480i] [4:3] [2:02] The only other extra is a theatrical trailer.

Finally, The Black Swan is full of action and it is a fun and thrilling swashbuckler with romantic energy and one that its many fans voted to see on a Blu-ray release and their wishes were granted. Tyrone Power is a very devilish romantic believable as a pirate, and especially with is fine romantic skirmishes with Maureen O'Hara, who is her typically tempestuous self. The supporting cast is one of the chief pleasures here, as are the stunning cinematography images by Leon Shamroy and of course the awesome swashbuckling music of composer Alfred Newman. The Black Swan is in the golden tradition of boyish adventures, and I suspect small children after watching this film will probably be brandishing wooden swords in the lounge and running amok in slitting the sofa pillows for some time to come. But I also bet a lot of grown-ups are going to want to do the same. Highly Recommended!

I was greatly disappointed to discover that the main character (I can't call him a hero) all but rapes the heroine early on. He spends the rest of the movie stalking her, sleeping in her bed when pirates take over the mansion (and telling her about how he likes finding her garters), pulling up her skirts, and then abducting her. I felt physically relieved in a sequence where the other guy, who's supposed to be a priggish loser, swoops in to rescue Lady Margaret from him.

I was looking forward to Maureen O'Hara as the saucy spitfire I'd heard she was in this film. Guys, hitting your attacker with a rock is not sauciness - it's a survival instinct.

To me, the ending seems like a bad case of Stockholm syndrome that somebody should have saved Lady Margaret from.

752998,5,6303943004,"ONLY A CLASSIC made in 1942 would begin with a sexual assault and end with the two involved as lovers. But that was the time when the 1930 Hays Code was in full swing  and rigidly enforced, according to an outstanding commentary from Maureen OHara and American film historian Rudy Behlmer on the high-def release of The Black Swan, starring OHara (Lady Margaret Denby) and Tyrone Power (Jamie Waring).

Still, one of the moments the movie has going for it comes when OHaras beautiful damsel clocks pirate captain Power with a rock.

The Hays Code enforced moral guidelines on film for decades. That they also enforced extreme double standards between genders is a byproduct of the time. Men were aggressive; women screamed for help. Before the rock-clocking, Powers captain says, In Tortuga, when a woman slaps a mans face, it means she wants him to grab her, overpower her and smother her with kisses. I understand in Jamaica, a gentleman must refuse such overtures.

Only an idiot or a classic hero can deliver a line like that seriously.

Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Scaramouche and The Black Swan, all swashbucklers and all written by Rafael Sabatini and made into successful motion pictures, are as filled with such dialogue as they are sword fights and sea battles. But like George Sanders, known for his roles as an elite sophisticate (Rebecca, All About Eve), who is unrecognizable with red hair and a beard in his role as pirate captain Billy Leech, none bear much resemblance to the original. (Sanders wanted heavy make-up so it would be easier for his stunt-double to fake him in action scenes.) They keep names, locations and, in The Black Swans case, a historical fact  that pirate Captain Henry Morgan (Laird Cregar) was pardoned for piracy by the crown and made governor of Jamaica.

Still, when Morgan chases after Jamie Waring after he kidnaps Lady Margaret, it stretches ones disbelief, especially when the old pirate has his hands-on-hips moment of indignation.

As a newly rehabilitated pirate, Jamie is helping Gov. Morgan rid the Caribbean of former buccaneer pals, since the Crown no longer needs the funds generated from its privateer swashbucklers. But those like Billy Leech want to keep to their buccaneering ways, with help from spies in Morgans office reporting where Morgans patrols are heading. Jamie decides to appear as traitor to Morgan and a new pal to Leech to find the spy and capture the pirates. But he cant enforce his plan without taking Lady Margaret along; shes about to be married and he just cant have that.

The movie, directed by Henry King, won an Oscar for Best Cinematography (color) by Leon Shamroy (The King and I, Planet of the Apes, Twelve OClock High) and is used as an example of the art in film classes today. It was the first pirate movie to be filmed in Technicolor and studio producer Daryl F. Zanuck wanted to make the most of it. But, Im Im happy to say the restoration is beautiful and full of vivid color. It was also nominated for Best Effects and Best Special Effects (photography and sound) and Best Film Score by Alfred Newman, that surround the room along with clear dialogue and effects. It was also nominated for Best Effects and Best Special Effects (photography and sound) and Best Film Score by Alfred Newman, that surround the room along with clear dialogue and effects.

The commentary with Behlmer and OHara is a winner. At 83, OHara  known for her many high-tempered roles with John Wayne  is still a pistol or, in this case, a sword. She talks about how she learned to fence and use a whip from studio masters. She admits to being an Irish tomboy, nave enough to fall for Tyrone Powers on-set jokes. Shes quick to demand, Where did you hear that? on a few of Behlmers comments  and correct him, too. Both wax poetic about the Hays Code, wishing todays films might return to some judicial editing. The audience was required to use their mind rather than seeing every act in its raw state. Screenwriters, directors and the audience had to use their imaginations, OHara tells us.

Behlmer agrees that it is difficult to believe in romance once one has witnessed an orgy of flesh onscreen.

Both make a good point; still, studios can leave those old double-standards behind.",1389830400,2,4250,4.786885245901639

Based on another Rafael Sabatini novel, THE BLACK SWAN is a colorful 1942 pirate swashbuckler; it stars one of 20th Century Fox's then top box office draws in Tyrone Power. Power had built a wealth of cachet with me, personally, what with my having viewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mark-of-Zorro-Special-Edition-Colorized-Black-and-White/dp/B000A9QK8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mark of Zorro (Special Edition) (Colorized / Black and White)</a>&nbsp;over and over somewhen in my kidhood.

""...when villainy wore a sash, and the only political creed in the world was... love, gold, and adventure..."" That boastful bit of scripture, which opens the film, along with Alfred Newman's immediately rousing score, nicely preps its audience. THE BLACK SWAN features a real-life historical figure in Sir Henry Morgan, a scalawag gone straight, played with larger-than-life bombast by larger-than-life actor Laird Cregar. He pivots the plot.

When ruthless pirate captain Henry Morgan is pardoned by the British throne and promoted as the new governor of the colony of Jamaica, he enlists the bold Jamie Waring (Power), his trusted right hand man under the Jolly Roger. The British Empire's logic in Morgan's appointment is that Morgan would then dissuade his fellow buccaneers from their acts of piracy in exchange for land and amnesty. Morgan manages to coax Jamie Waring to his side, yeah. But enough of them other wicked sea rats opt to still hoist the Jolly Roger, led by the vile Captain Leech (George Sanders). And as good British ships continue to navigate the Caribbean, only to be boarded and plundered, Sir Henry Morgan's governorship grows ever more precarious.

But this isn't about him. The story revolves around impulsive Jamie Waring, a rogue ill-suited to reform. In Port Royal, Jamaica, when he sets eyes on the former governor's feisty daughter, Lady Margaret Denby (Maureen O'Hara), it'll either be the damning of him or the making of him. Tyrone Power's smooth swagger serves him well one more time. Honestly, I know he's worked well in other genres, but it's the swashbuckler in which he's made his mark. Easy on the eyes, in his heyday, he was regarded as a top matinee idol. He surely shivered the timbers of many a female movie-goer. Power constructs a fine, combustible chemistry with the always gorgeous Maureen O'Hara, she of the red hair and the fiery Irish temper. Lady Margaret, predictably, disdains Jamie's aggressive advances. Except that Jamie, not as reformed a pirate as the new governor may wish, keeps on being undaunted. On a mission to unearth a traitor in their midst, Jamie takes an opportunity for a bit of a snatch and grab. And if you thought Lady Margaret harbored a foul temperament, imagine her pique at finding herself abducted and sailing the Spanish Main.

THE BLACK SWAN gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. The narrative unfolds in conventional manner, yeah, but it still has much to offer. THE BLACK SWAN delivers a torrid romance, lots of pirate bluster, and plenty of derring-do on the high seas. It's a good cast, anchored by Power and O'Hara and supported by Laird Cregar, an eye-patched Anthony Quinn, and an unrecognizable George Sanders, camouflaged in a wild red wig and beard and sporting a decidedly more low brow elocution. Basil Rathbone, Hollywood actor and swordsman, once referred to Power as ""the most agile man with a sword I've ever faced before a camera."" Rathbone wasn't as complimentary of Errol Flynn. The climactic duel between Jamie and Captain Leech isn't as memorable or as brilliantly staged as the classic duel in THE MARK OF ZORRO, but it's nevertheless a thrilling sequence and shows off Tyrone Power's remarkable athleticism and grace. One other thing that stands out for me is how Power portrays his character. Captain Jamie Waring, never forget, is at heart a pirate, nursing his own harsher code of ethics, and Power plays up his lack of couth. He makes sure that Jamie isn't too much the gentleman. There's deviltry and a dangerous aura about him. His loutish behavior when he first meets Lady Margaret may make you raise an eyebrow. I think it adds more dimensions to the story, having a flesh-and-blood protagonist who occasionally falls prey to his own crudeness. When Lady Margaret tames him at the end of the film, I tend to side with Jamie's mildly disgusted shipmates. ""There he goes,"" one remarks, watching the lip-locked couple. ""It's the end of the Spanish Main.""

Instead, (to me) it was ridiculously lame in script, and the set was less than par.  I guess this was to be a comedy, although the write ups didn't describe it as such.  The movie was heralded as ""brawny and blood-curlding,"" as ""an adventure of a lifetime.""  Hardly.  If The Black Swan was billed as an adventurous comedy, I would have gone in with that mindset.  Albeit, still let down as I didn't find it funny either.  Instead I agonized over Tyrone Power's character Jamie Boy as a reformed pirate, because he was nothing but a bumbling goof.  The DVD jacket portrays Powers as a strong man to be reckoned with, but his dialog blows that out of the water.  If you want to see an Oscar winning movie from 1942, watch Casablanca.  If you want a comedy from the same year view Road to Morocco.  I'm sorry, but for me this was a waste of my money as I'll never watch the movie again.",1305763200,,1038,4.321243523316062

I hadn't heard about any pirate films other than the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film.  I figured it was a market competitor to the Disney product.  I was wrong, and unfortunately so.  No pirate film, just some strange weirdo psycho-flick about some schizophrenic ballet dancer.

Huh.
JOKE MODE OFF:

Well, regardless, I'll always have Tyrone Power's film, ""The Black Swan"" which shows a colorful swashbuckler galavanting on the screen, fighting both government and other pirates as a former pirate turns gentleman, only to become a pirate again.  Tyrone helps said pirate, and does his part.

The acting is late 30s stiltedness, but the colorful presentation help alleviate some of the less refined film making methods and presentation.

The action sequences are massive and impressive.  If the somewhat wooden thesping turns you away, then the story, adventure and action sequences should help make up for it.  Definitely one to see again and again.",1304035200,2,1046,5.058479532163743
753221,4,6303943004,"This movie is based on historic fact: Henry Morgan began his career as a notable pirate, but later received a royal pardon and was named Governor of Jamaica.  Morgan (Laird Cregar), like so many bad-guys-turned-good, is resolved to be a watchdog of honesty, and sensibly decides that if he can't get his old friends to reform by offering them pardons and land, the best way to run them down is to use the ones who *will* accept his clemency.  Jamie Waring (Tyrone Power) and his friend Tommy Blue (Thomas Mitchell) are among the leaders of this group, while Billy Leech (that perennial British villain George Sanders) and his one-eyed first mate Wogan (Anthony Quinn) lead the opposition.  But Jamie finds that hunting his former counterparts is a walk  (or perhaps a sail) in the park compared to politics.  The former Governor of Jamaica, Lord Denby (George Zucco), doesn't at all appreciate losing his office, and he soon begins stirring up the Governor's Council against Morgan, claiming that he's only pretending to be a pirate-hunter.  That Jamie has a thing for Denby's daughter Lady Margaret (Maureen O'Hara)--who thinks he's despicable--only complicates the issue.  But when the two of them fall into Leech's hands, Margaret sees a new side of Jamie as he works to keep Leech from learning who he's really working for.

Though perhaps not quite as good as that other classic adaptation of Sabatini,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Blood/dp/B00005JMR7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Blood</a>, this one has the advantage of being in full color and featuring O'Hara in her best kind of role, the fiery young woman playing out ""The Taming of the Shrew"" with the man who's resolved to win her love.

Tyrone Power was one of our heroes and we all loved Maureen O'Hara. What a magnificent adventure story, dripped with technicolor.  Who cares about the slight errors in the Spanish Main history when we have here the most dashing and handsome Hollywood star next to the lovely red head spitfire,and the villainous George Sanders. Remembering this wonderful nostalgic movie is a fitting tribute to Tyrone Power.  Although discredited by some because of his unusual good looks, lets remember that he proudly served as a pilot in World War 11, and he died prematurely while making a swashbuckler in 1958.

I've seen Errol Flynn's Captain Blood, Adventures of Robin Hood, and Sea Hawk, and the newer Pirates of the Caribbean movies can't begin to compare to Errol Flynn's.  But compared to Errol Flynn's, The Black Swan is superior!  The fun thing about pirate movies of this era, Hollywood's Golden Age, is that the pirates were rebels without being rapists, and they had a sense of honor, even if in reality, pirates rarely did.  Such is the case with The Black Swan, featuring a reforming pirate who has not completely lost his rebellious streak.  The comedy, adventure, and romance elements of the movie work perfectly together (the comedy is greatest when Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara spar), the audiocommentary is delightful to listen to, and the movie has so much variety and plot twists, that I rank this as one of the most fun and high-quality movies ever.

Not as good as some in the genre, although there are moments when Power shows more of his ability. Maureen O'Hara is as good as ever, though. The film also suffers from poor plotting, unlike the book, and seems truncated--I suspect too many scenes were left on the cutting room floor, and as a result, character development suffers. A shame, as both the primary and secondary cast are capable of much more.

753292,3,6303943004,"The Black Swan is a fast paced swashbuckler that will keep you entertained as far as the action is concerned. It's the between moments that cause the film not to reach greater heights. The Black Swan is directed by Henry King who was a dependable director, at times elevating his films over the ordinary. The Black Swan suffers because of its pacing, it's too fast & most of the characters don't develop sufficiently.

Capt. Jamie Waring (Tyrone Power) is a pirate & has been captured by the English. The English have taken an interest in stopping the pirates because they have signed a peace treaty with the Spanish. Waring is on the rack about to suffer his doom. His torturer is the Governor of Jamaica, Lord Denby (George Zucco). Waring is rescued by his friend, Tommy Blue (Thomas Mitchell).

Denby is replaced as Governor with another pirate, Henry Morgan (Laird Cregar). The English have decided the best way to stop the pirates is to put a pirate on their trail. Morgan convinces most of the pirates to go legitimate. Capt. Leech (George Sanders) is the exception who decides to continue his piracy.

Along the way Waring encounters Denby's daughter, Margaret (Maureen O'Hara). Waring falls in love with Margaret but the feeling isn't mutual. She's betrothed to Roger Ingram (Edward Ashley) who, on the surface, appears to be a better man than Waring. But Ingram is the man behind the scenes who has struck a deal with Leech informing him of where the treasure ships will be. This causes Morgan's governorship to be in jeopardy because the pirates are succeeding while his men aren't.

Waring ends up kidnapping Margaret & taking her away on his ship. This angers Morgan. Furthermore, it appears that Waring has switched sides joining up with Leech.

The Black Swan is a fun movie that moves along crisply. The problem is that the characters are mostly cardboard. Morgan is all bluster speaking loudly most of the time. Anthony Quinn (Wogan) is totally wasted in a small role. Power is in fine form, he & Leech have a great duel though some of it is sped up. Sanders is fine as Leech. Maureen O'Hara is basically the obligatory female lead. O'Hara isn't the problem though, it's the character. She can't stand Waring, she agrees to help save their hides & then abruptly falls in love with him.

""I like to sip the wine before I buy it."" is said by Waring & Margaret; Waring when he kidnaps her & by Margaret when she falls in love with him at the end.

The picture quality is great with vivid colors. It's shown in the full screen ratio (1.33:1). There are four audio tracks: English Mono, English Stereo, French Mono & Spanish Mono.

Great Pirate yarn, set in the caribbean, Captain Henry Morgan has become Governor in order to pursuade the other pirates to settle down now that England is no longer at war.  Tyrone Powers, Maureen O'Hara, and George Saunders (always great), not to mention several other great actors in this movie.  I would say this movie is great quality and while it is, its been restored, so it should be, but the restoration has striped some of the lovely technicolor away, the colors that I enjoyed watching as a kid are gone, they do have segment that shows you what the movie looked like before they changed it, they took out a lot of the red hues, so Maureen O'Hara's hair is not red, Tyrone (often shirtless) is pale instead of tanish, and the sun sets are not their brillant color, so you might have to adjust your TV color to watch, I have to do that on several movies that have been restored for DVD.

Even if the film's plot and acting bored you stiff (and it won't) it's beautiful just to look at.  If you like swashbuckling films that are colorful and fun, The Princess & the Pirate, with Virginia Mayo and Bob Hope are great, too.  This is a great movie to watch George Sanders as a campy villian (something he doesn't usually do; he usually plays the seriously bad bad guy)and Thomas Mitchell is likeable and interesting in just about anything.

But Fox, although they've lavished color and pretty costumes and sets on THE BLACK SWAN, failed to invest it with the same witty script and believable situations.

The performances are all bigger than life, as they should be in this sort of thing. TYRONE POWER makes a dashing figure of Jamie, the pirate seeking to avenge the villainous Leech (an almost unrecognizable GEORGE SANDERS in heavy beard and wig). MAUREEN O'HARA is so authentically feisty in opposing Power's advances that one wonders whether they can ever make up in time for a happy ending. Nevertheless, hers is a one-dimensional role and she gives it no added dimension of warmth but remains an ice princess throughout, much to my disappointment.

The acting is uniformly competent--nothing more--and the entire tone of the more serious moments in the courtrooms makes you wonder whether to simply suspend disbelief or accept it as a tongue-in-cheek pirate adventure. LAIRD CRAIGAR makes an interesting buccaneer but chews the scenery with a vengeance. His energy gives the part believability most of the time but his actions are none too convincing in the final battle scene. THOMAS MITCHELL seems a little out of place as a fellow pirate.

TYRONE POWER and MAUREEN O'HARA make delicious eye candy as a couple, but something in their chemistry is missing. Perhaps they're too combative throughout before the final clinch in the sunset--and that, of course, is the script's fault for providing a somewhat contrived happy ending.

In many ways, more satisfying than ""Pirates of the Carribean"" since this film is slightly more grounded in a recognizable reality, and is therefore somehow more accessible. The Technicolor photography, which was one of the film's many assets, receives much attention on this DVD, with Maureen O'Hara's commentary discussing the technique and the film's use of it. But the transfer here isn't up to snuff: some scenes are soft, and the color is subdued and muddy ocassionally. It's not a bad transfer, but certainly not as sharp as Fox's ""Leave Her to Heaven,"" or ""Blood and Sand"". Still, for fans of  Power, O'Hara, or the underrated Laird Cregar, an entertaining and physically lavish production worth more than one viewing.

753473,5,6303943004,"I first caught The Black Swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien O'Hara.....

So it's all the usual stuff - kidnapping, sword-fighting, stealing, drinking, pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout. But you know what - it's not that you know what you're getting, it's that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would. Sure, everything's the same, but somehow strangely different. The story and characters are as seen before - but with the likes of Sanders, Power and O'Hara as the love interest, and the great character actor Cregar playing against type - you have life breathed into the character's that's so often lacking. And the original story by one Rafael Sabatini - who also brought us Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk - is a rip-roaring boys-own adventure.

Director Henry King - no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks - cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency. It's a spare, fluid film with a simple, but fun, narrative and visual splendour that puts other films, even those made today, out to pasture.

This DVD manages to capture that splendour in abundance - the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein, with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best. Just check out the restoration comparison to see how good. In addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian Rudy Behlmer.

Power plays a pirate captain in the Caribbean who prays upon Spanish shipping. He is one of the infamous Henry Morgan's lieutenants. As the show opens, Morgan has been sent to England to stand trial for piracy and Power is about to be captured by the Spanish. He is contemplating giving up the pirate lifestyle but the point becomes moot when he is captured by the Spanish.

He is showing defiance to the Spanish governor and is suffering on the rack when the rest of the pirates show up and rescue him. The victorious pirates are about to have their vengeance upon the hapless and cowardly Spaniards when Captain Morgan shows up and stops them. Much to everyone's surprise, he has been pardoned by the king and appointed as the new governor of Jamaica under the theory that he would be most effective at rooting out the pirates. England is now at peace with Spain and the two want to suppress the freelance ""free trade"".

Captain Morgan is in a hard position. He is not trusted by the upper crust of the island and neither is he trusted by all of his old subordinates who are determined to continue their piratical ways.

Tyrone Power is one of those trusted by Capt. Morgan and is determined to help him but his mind is preoccupied. He is in love with the daughter of the former governor (O'Hara) but she holds him in contempt. Finally, in order to secure all his aims, he goes ""undercover"" and poses as a relapsed pirate.

In the swashbuckler tradition, everything turns up roses after a few swordfights and broadsides.

I wanted to see it after reading about the movie in Everson's ""The Bad Guys.""  The commentary on the DVD release by Rudy Behlmer and Maureen O'Hara is a real plus, the restoration looks fine but there is one slight problem with my DVD of this movie.  The first DVD Amazon sent me had freezes during the dueling scene between George Sanders and Tyrone Power.  I ran DVDInfoPro, which showed plenty of read errors.  The replacement DVD Amazon sent me played fine during the big duel, but when I ran the CRC Read Error test on the new DVD, it showed 24 errors, the first occurring at about 4 GB mark, 62% through the movie, apparently just after the layer change (shown by a red line on the display).  At the 75% completion point of the test, there were no more reported read errors.

After all the effort 20th Century Fox went to restore the movie (40 hours of time, according to the restoration short), you would think someone at the DVD mastering company would run a scan on the pressed DVD, to see if there were read errors.  I could be just unlucky and have gotten two defective discs in a row, or, more likely, the studio did not catch a manufacturing error and released a bad batch of DVDs among those produced.  When I received the replacement DVD, the cardboard box was crushed and the DVD case was busted, but the DVD inside was unmarked.

Maureen O'Hara has the requisite feistiness as Lady Margaret that suggests the greater work to come in her work with John Ford and John Wayne.  Is it redundant to say that the Technicolor process never loved an actress more than O'Hara?  Probably the closest I can think of is Elizabeth Taylor.  Laird Cregar makes for a terrifically flamboyant Captain Morgan.  If you want another good sampling of this terrific character actor's work check out ""I Wake Up Screaming"" in the Fox Film Noir Series.  Excellent story.  Terrific action setpieces abound.

Directed by Henry King and stars Tyrone Power, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn, George Sanders, Laird Cregar, George Zucco, Thomas Mitchell.

  This is one great swashbuckler.  As I remember it, this is the one where Maureen O'Hara has to say ""Jamie Boy"" three times before she can win the heart of Tyrone.  At the very end she does and when they kiss she literally SUCKS his face with a mouth open enough to eat a 14 lb. potato.  George Sanders is the bad guy and you really hate him.  The plot has to do with the Black Swan being a sought after pirate frigate which of course the hero gets along with the girl.  Morgan the Pirate is made the govenor of Jamaica and he wants to go after all the rivaling gangs now that he has position power.

Music by Alfred Newman (nominated for best music) and it won an oscar for cinematography.  It's in glorious technicolor and one beautiful movie, not to be missed by anyone who loves pirate movies.

Maureen O'Hara was in another swashbuckler from 1952 with Errol Flynn (AGAINST ALL FLAGS) and while I mention her, she was also in SINBAD THE SAILOR and AT SWORD'S POINT and of course her film debut in Hitchcock's JAMAICA INN but I think her best was THE BLACK SWAN as far as swashbucklers go.",1147132800,56,1253,4.427947598253275

Fox needs to stop being so concerned about The Simpsons and The X-Files and start releasing all of Tyrone Power's movies on DVD, including this one. Tyrone Power was the handsomest actor in Hollywood, and his movies were some of the best ever made.",1076457600,15,668,4.817391304347826
753792,4,6303943004,"Tyrone Power and the stunning flame haired Maureen O'Hara make a fetching couple in the colorful and rollicking swashbuckling costumer The Black Swan.
Set in the Caribbean in the 1650's, the former pirate Henry Morgan, played by the blustering and unfortunate titan Laird Cregar has just been named governor of Jamaica.  He commissions his right hand man captain Jamie Waring played by the dashing Power, and his mates to rid the area of pirates.  Captain Billy Leech played by the ridiculously red wigged and bearded George Sanders refuses to follow Morgan's orders.  Aided by Anthony Quinn, complete with eyepatch, they set out to plunder Maracaibo on the The Black Swan.
Power, smitten with O'Hara, who plays the former Jamaican governor's daughter, kidnaps her and sets out to sea after Sanders.

Perhaps Tyrone Power was limited by the script to play an unkind and unnecessarily violent man who showed verve and some honor, but really very little charm. Except that it was the end of the movie, I saw no reason at all why ""the Lady Margaret"" fell for him at all. He wasn't witty or caring; he was helpful to her only when it served his own ends, and he didn't save her life in any direct way. Some kind of role model for boys growing up in the 40s!
Folks, Captain Blood is still the best pirate movie (and best doctor movie) ever.
On the plus side, The Black Swan's action sequences are good enough to carry the movie along. There is some very fast swordplay and the large, elaborate ship models are beautiful to see.",1064448000,2,883,4.293413173652695

753800,5,6303943004,"What is perhaps the most perfect thing about this movie is that it captures the true essence of the swashbuckling films.  ""The Black Swan"" is both directed and acted with a refreshing abandonment.  Everything is let loose and blown up and had fun with, and it's quite a ride from beginning to end.  Even such props as the costumes, which can overshadow the people in them, or the script, which can sometimes seem too lofty, only compliment the overall treat.  We're given a daring adventure, vibrant characters, and exquisite scenery, and all we're asked is to have fun while we're visiting.
Tyrone Power (as Captain Jamie Waring) and Maureen O'Hara (as Margaret Denby) create the ultimate classic pirate/noblewoman couple, complete with Tyrone's charismatic charm and Maureen's signature spitfire nature.  Their scenes together spark with that unique chemistry and also with an effortless humor that is more intelligent than slapstick and yet remains by and large unpredictable.  They take turns being abused by just about everyone, including each other, and what should have been the most romantic moment (in bed together, a distinct no-no in Hollywood at the time) is rather a tense moment with death leering over them literally.  They make a memorable couple, surrounded by a host of splendid actors.
George Sanders is once again a convincing villain, though far removed from his customary suave and sophisticated roles, and his coarse red beard helps those who might have trouble with this new image.  Anthony Quinn is his nasty sidekick, alternately grinning maliciously at Jamie or leering over Margaret.  Laird Cregar is wonderful as Captain Morgan, alternately proud of and frustrated with Jamie.  Thomas Mitchell is perfectly cast as Jamie's right hand man and the would-be source of wisdom for all of Jamie's women troubles.
You must watch this movie in the same spirit that it was made, with your hair down and your heart open to excitement and your mind turned away from somber matters.  Watch it if you want to lose a foul mood, or if you want to see some marvelous (award-winning) cinematography, or if you simply want to escape back into this fantasy world that Hollywood created so long ago--when leading men were as beautiful as their female counterparts, and when leading ladies always wore impeccable makeup, and when grand adventures didn't need to start or end on a tragedy.",970531200,175,2396,5.055837563451776
753801,5,6303943004,"Glancing over the comments of some other reviewers here, one would think this was a ""pirate"" movie.  Well, yes, it is.

Romances are  fantasies and in such, it doesn't matter that the hero is prettier than he  should be or if George Sanders' beard looked strange.
For the women  reading this, go rent this movie!  Lots of fun, fun, fun with titillating  scenes (tame for now) not usually allowed by the movie code.  Tyrone Power  as Captain Waring never looked so good and is shown shirtless, splattered  with wine, and stretched on a rack for your pleasure.
