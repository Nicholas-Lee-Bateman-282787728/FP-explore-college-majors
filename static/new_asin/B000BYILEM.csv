2447065,3,B000BYILEM,"Funky and typical grade B with an attempt to put forth a message that does not quite make it.  I watch it but then slept through some of it - did not lose any of the muddled plot.  After killing dozens of Indians and no horses, the hero decides not to kill the guy who was responsible.  The hero showed empathy and let the bad guy, but not really a bad guy, ride off into the sunset.  Sometimes these films are enjoyable - no thinking required.",1462406400,2,444,4.127906976744186

2447085,2,B000BYILEM,Poor representation of the actual Gatling gun. It gun was never reloaded by continued to fire even though all the rounds in the magazine had been used. The sounds used were nothing like the actual fire of the Gatling gun.,1411603200,,221,4.55
2447086,3,B000BYILEM,"Released in 1973 this movie is a standard western of the time, white hats and black hats, In my opinion the video quality could have been better",1411084800,,144,4.37037037037037
2447087,5,B000BYILEM,Great Movie! I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it mostly because my favorite actor of all time starred in it.,1409356800,,109,4.238095238095238

2447089,4,B000BYILEM,"""The Gatling Gun"" was originally titled King Gun and shot in 1969, but not released till 1971. It's a cavalry vs. Indians Western focusing on the eponymous weapon with a great cast of familiars -- Guy Stockwell, Robert Fuller, Phil Harris, Woody Strode, Patrick Wayne, John Carradine, Pat Buttram and BarBara Luna (from Star Trek's ""Mirror, Mirror"") -- highlighted by curvy redhead Judy Jordan, to say the least.

Critics write it off as ""routine"" and akin to a TV Western. True, it is Grade B and comic-booky, but the cast clicks and the story delivers the goods, as far as Western (melo)drama & action goes. It's essentially a survival tale of a small group of soldiers and civilians who team-up to survive a desert trek threatened by Two-Knife (Carlos Rivas) and his rogue tribe. If you're a sucker for desert-survival tales (like me), such as ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (1965), ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965), ""Escape from Zahrain"" (1962) and ""They Came to Cordura"" (1959), you'll probably appreciate ""The Gatling Gun."" It's not as good as the first three, but it's more entertaining than the last one. While Cordura is more serious production with overall superior quality, its also more hokey.

The trek through the desert features a lot of drama but the movie ends with a bang as the group squares-off against Two-Knife and his braves. Stockwell stands out as the alpha male Army Lieutenant who naturally attracts the babe (Jordan), whereas Fuller is effective as Private Sneed, done-in by his own lust for filthy lucre.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot at Eaves Movie Ranch and Ghost Ranch near Sante Fe, New Mexico. DIRECTOR: Robert Gordon. WRITERS: Mark Hanna &  Joseph Van Winkle.

2447091,2,B000BYILEM,Like many said the picture quality is quite poor.  I mean 8mm color poor except worst.  Then at the end there is 15 minutes of nothing...no audio or video.  What is with that?  The audio was not good either however I could hear everything.  What really got me was the complete lack of plot.  Formulaic does not even catch it.  The movie is pretty good for about five minutes and then turns into this grueling arduous march to the end of the movie which it finally did.  I skipped about half of the movie and where I came back in looked exactly like where I went for fast forward.  This movie is tediously slow paced filled with mindless action and just more nothing than anything.  An edit to about 30 minutes with all the best scenes included could make a decent short.  I recommend whenever this gets old use fast forward to speed things up.,1387584000,,843,4.374193548387097
2447092,1,B000BYILEM,"a very bad cheap plot of a movie.  Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed.  This movie may have been what killed western.",1363219200,,128,4.7727272727272725
2447093,3,B000BYILEM,"Gatling Gun & King Gun ARE the same movie. My father was one of the producers of the movie which was filmed outside Santa Fe in 1969 but originally titled as a 1970 release under the name ""King Gun."" Its sneak preview took place in Milwaukee because that is where the producers (Broadway Enterprises) were from. The sneak preview was poorly edited: In a wide shot you could see a jet fly overhead and in another scene after an Indian gets shot his blood pack didn't break and he had to hit himself in the eye three or four times before it burst. Another scene shows an Indian shot off his horse and in the close up you can see his Timex watch. Originally, we thought it was a comedy but after talking to my dad over the phone (he was out of town) he was stunned to hear what we had to say. It was subsequently re-edited and retitled as The Gatling Gun and sold to Turner Broadcasting. Usually seen as a late night B-Western movie it really is pretty good. Though none of the original investors made any money off the movie it did generate many great stories and good laughs, and several large tax deductions.",1362096000,4,1108,4.331730769230769
2447094,3,B000BYILEM,"I saw this flick a couple of times growing up.  It's nothing much to brag about, but it's a passable western.  My real review regards Amazon's streaming; it looks pretty bad.  The colors are there, but the image and overall transfer are of a low grade.  The movie isn't that sterling to begin with, but it's solid western fare.

The shots are amateurish, the directing is b-grade, but the script is decent enough.  Too bad the image is slightly washed and pixilated.

If you subscribed to Amazon Prime, you might want to view it for an evening, but otherwise don't spend the money to rent it.",1331424000,,592,4.528301886792453
2447095,3,B000BYILEM,"This isn't the best Western I've seen, but it shows a lot of Indians getting killed by the gatling gun, so if you like rooting for Indians, you'll be disappointed. The movie just shows a band of people transporting the gun through Indian territory. It just so happens the gun doesn't operate when it's missing a working part, so I guess this is suppose to show that the men is vulnerable to attack, when without their deadly weapon. The movie ends abruptly, making you wonder what was the plot to begin with after all. I have no complaint of the quality of video or audio, it's not the best, but doesn't take away from viewing pleasure.",1323907200,2,636,4.491379310344827
2447096,3,B000BYILEM,I was disappointed with this dvd. The acting is both very good and very bad. I do not think the over all finished product did justice to what could have been a great storyline.,1323388800,3,176,4.205882352941177

2447101,3,B000BYILEM,"The Gatling Gun, aka King Gun, is a nice little western with a good cast of western regulars.  The US Cavalry is stretched pretty thin all across the Southwest as the Apaches attack all over the territory.  The government sends a Gatling Gun to each military post to help fend off the Indians.  At one outpost, the gun is stolen so a troop must go out and bring it back.  During the rescue effort, the troop comes across a family trying to make it to safety.  The cavalry troop and the family must fight their way home as an Apache chief, Two Knifes, and over a hundred braves close in on them.  There is nothing really special about this movie, but I enjoyed it.  If you can find a copy for cheap, I recommend it.

  Guy Stockwell plays Lt. Malcolm, the leader of the cavalry troop trying to recover a Gatling gun and survive countless Apache attacks.  Robert Fuller plays Sneed, a greedy soldier who tries to dispose of the gun with Rev. Harper, John Carradine's character.  Barbara Luna stars as Leona, the treacherous reverend's daughter who will do anything to survive.  Woody Strode is Runner, the army scout leading the troop through Apache territory.  The family travelling along with the troop includes Patrick Wayne as Jim, Pat Buttram as Tin Pot, Phil Harris as Boland, and Judy Jordan as Martha.  The Apache chief Two Knives is played by Carlos Rivas.  The VHS offers a decent looking copy with colors that fade in and out at certain points in the movie.  For an enjoyable western with a good cast and an exciting climax, check out The Gatling Gun!",1104537600,9,1560,4.553956834532374
8094279,1,B000BYILEM,1/2 of 1 star.  Exceedingly poor. One bright spot: Barbara Luna.  She is as lovely as any Latina i have ever seen - but watching this TV movie is just too high a price to pay. I could only manage about 10 minutes.,1498780800,,213,3.9302325581395348
