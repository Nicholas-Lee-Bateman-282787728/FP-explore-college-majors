7834029,4,6303002110,"This is the very first ballroom dancing tape I have watched, and it was very helpful. I had always viewed the Ramba as a difficult dance, but this video cleared a lot of the confusion I had. I learned to waltz and jaive when I was in my teens, but my fiance just started learning, and this tape has been of immense help for both of us, especially for him. The instructors didn't go too fast, and we were able to keep up quite easily. I would recommend this tape to anyone who wants to learn the basics of these three dances.",1025049600,2,524,4.147058823529412

The music is fifties-style oldies, which really doesn't fit the tuxes on the cover. He does very clearly teach the moves.  You'll need to go elsewhere to learn style points and how to make the dances flow.",972777600,12,364,4.402985074626866
