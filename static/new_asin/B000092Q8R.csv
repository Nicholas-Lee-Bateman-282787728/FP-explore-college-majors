1876829,4,B000092Q8R,"I could have loved this, but there was cursing Jesus' name. It was a different kind of story with a scummy detective, ex girlfriend and ex cop. No sex which was nice. Detailed history of the three makes the story more credible. Surprise ending and closure on their pasts. Had two short bikini clad girl wrestling matches as the attention getter..",1471824000,,346,4.688524590163935
1876830,3,B000092Q8R,"In New Zealand, Dean Riley (C. Thomas Howell) is accused of murder. He claims he is innocent. His wife (Kim Michalis) tries to hire a private detective (Stephen Papps) but can only afford his secretary (Angela Marie Dotchin) a wannabe investigator. She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend (Kevin Smith) a cop who was dismissed from the force for conduct unbecoming while interrogator a hooker in the interrogation room.  When a similar murder happens, Detective Snow (Ross Duncan) claims they are unrelated. The only way they can free Riley is to find the killer.

This has all the feel of a made for TV film. While not horribly bad, it wasn't horribly good. The movie held my interest, but the who-dun-it aspect was a failure as it didn't give us any head fakes or clues that we could solve it ourselves first. Angela Dotchin reminded me of Traci Lords with her attitude. It felt anachronistic watching modern people trampling through Lothlrien.

A film you could easily watch at 1:00 AM while channel surfing.

No swearing, sex. Corpse butt nudity. Women in bikinis wrestling.",1416528000,3,1079,4.879781420765028
1876831,2,B000092Q8R,"A fairly engaging thriller filmed within the Auckland/Waitakere region of New Zealand, and featuring Auckland area actors in lead roles, this work is the second from a set of three showcasing a nonconformist former policeman, John Lawless (Kevin Smith) and his quondam police partner, Jodie Keen (Angela Dotchin), in this tale the pair having dedicated themselves toward solving a homicide of a female hitchhiker that is possibly related to a five-year-old case, although any connection between the two events is blurred by the fact that the suspect convicted of the first murder, Dean Riley (C. Thomas Howell) is still residing in prison.  Riley's wife Trina (Kim Michalis) has consistently maintained that her husband is innocent, and has met with success in arranging for an appeal hearing of his conviction.  Jodie, now employed as assistant to a private investigator, becomes involved with aiding Trina and her preparation for the appeal, and consequently is fired from her job.  She is then able to procure the services of Lawless, who has been working as a bouncer at a trashy tavern, where his physical condition has declined as a result of the company that he keeps.  Initially hesitant to assist Jodie and the Rileys, Lawless becomes increasingly interested in doing so after he learns that a former Police Department adversary, one Inspector Snow (Ross Duncan), has been given oversight of the pending appeal, causing John to believe that there may have been evidence tampering in the case.  Riley is convinced that he was framed by Snow, and when he escapes from the prison hospital, wherein he has been placed following an intentional act of self-mutilation, in order to hunt down the Inspector, the task taken on by John and Jodie to establish his innocence becomes immensely more formidable and a great deal more dangerous, as well.  The group of three ""Lawless"" works proved to be successful vehicles for Smith, who is given top billing and whose fans will be delighted with his bluff performance.  His premature death helped to lift his reputation to virtual cult status.  However, this film is highly imitative and follows what must be considered set guidelines for its genre.  The direction is flaccid and awkwardly paced, the narrative falling somewhat short of being coherent, due to flaws in logic and continuity that are probably to be expected from a movie that is to be sundered by commercial announcements.",1249689600,,2432,5.090452261306533
1876832,3,B000092Q8R,"Anyone who loved Kevin Smith as Ares in Xena should enjoy this movie.  I myself, preferred him with longer hair, but his good looks are still there.  Typical crime drama, I liked the first movie in this series of Lawless a lot better, but can't find a good DVD.",1169078400,2,261,4.3061224489795915
1876833,4,B000092Q8R,"DEAD EVIDENCE is a mystery thriller set and filmed in New Zealand.  That's a change, huh?  Angela Dotchin plays Jodie, a wannabe private eye who is working as girl Friday for a rather ineffective boorish boss.  One day she overhears her boss telling his female client that there's nothing he can do for her husband.  The husband is played by C. Thomas Howell, looking unusually buff and macho, and he is in jail for the rape and murder of a young girl five years ago.  His appeal is coming up and wife believes that a recent similar killing in the same neck of the woods may have been done by the same man who killed the previous girl.  She says hubby is innocent.  When the PI turns her down, Jodie decides to investigate on her own and in the process loses her job.  She hooks up with an ex-cop played quite handily by Kevin Smith, a roughened hunk, buff and hard-boiled.  Their private investigation goes awry when Howell breaks out of prison and goes to kill the cop he feels framed him.  During this break, Howell accidentally wounds Smith and Dotchin is on her own.  Her trail leads to a kindly veterinarian who just might be the killer.
The pace is tight and although there aren't any surprises once the killer is identified, Smith and Dotchin have a good chemistry and they are different kinds of heroes.
This is a pleasant surprise and worth viewing if you like the film noir type of mystery.",1084579200,6,1401,4.4763779527559056
7988577,4,B000092Q8R,"apparently the good movies that are remaining for me on Amazon Prime will be 4:3. That format is better than the 2.35 theater format as far as I am concerned. The audio was not 5.1 surround but the stereo decoded by phasing just fine. As I inferred, the story was interesting. As promised, there was action and violence.",1500249600,,320,4.5344827586206895
7988578,4,B000092Q8R,"Energy and pitfalls make for a good thriller and this had a tasty mix of both in the right degrees. Easy to watch, the movie was like a tennis match. moving from one character to another, but hanging together in the plot. Believable, with elements traditional to British film, it is a good watch.",1499558400,,296,4.5
