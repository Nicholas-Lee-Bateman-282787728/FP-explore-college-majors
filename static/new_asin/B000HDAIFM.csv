8138725,5,B000HDAIFM,"I have been asked to review this DVD because I bought it, however it was a present for my Uncle so having spoken to him on the phone the other day I have his consent to write this review. I bought this DVD for him for his Birthday. He has for sometime lived in America, an English man abroad, missing some English eccentricities such as cricket. I hoped this DVD would take him back to his youth, mission accomplished, he really enjoyed it, watching some of the greats at their peak, with the understated English commentary. Ideal gift for Cricket fanatics anywhere, Thank You to FSH Marketing for having stock of this peculiarly English game on DVD for the Expats in America, making present buying easier for relatives thousands of miles away.",1454976000,,744,4.643939393939394
8138726,4,B000HDAIFM,"If you're looking for a standard history of cricket, you won't get that here.  What you WILL get is a series of very good profiles of a number of modern-era greats of the game.  No W.G. Grace or Jack Hobbs, but you do get Don Bradman here, as well as profiles of Ian Botham, Viv Richards, Imran Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Martin Crowe and Graeme Pollock.

There's also an interesting panel discussion at the end among a group of men with terrific credentials in cricket as to what their ideal First Eleven would be that's almost worth the price of the DVD itself.",1224460800,3,560,4.470588235294118
