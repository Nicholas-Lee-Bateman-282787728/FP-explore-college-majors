1083752,4,6305840091,"I first saw this film on TV when I was in junior high.  It's definitely one of the greatest '60s films ever made.  Set in a future where the Pope is American, people get their kicks by participating in an assasination game.  Ursula Andress is one of the best in the game (mostly due to her bra gun).  The soundtrack and the production design are as outrageous as the action. It makes Austin Powers movies look like The O'Reilly Factor.",993513600,4,435,4.4
1083753,4,6305840091,"I first saw this film on the Million Dollar Movie on WOR Channel 9 out of NYC in 1968, and it is still on of my faves. It's droll and hip, and although it dates itself by some of the content, I still believe it was ahead of its time. Rent it at before buying. It's not for everyone. Must be seen for the opening sequence during which Ursula shoots a guy with her bikini top; this is the inspiration for the fem-bots in Austin Powers.",991958400,,433,4.046511627906977

Ursula Andress is at her most gorgeous, the clothes are so...MOD. The dubbing is terrible. they have a computer that talks and the voice is laughable, 1960's, I must keep that in mind. This is supposed to be the future.....funny as to what they thought the future would be back then.

1083831,2,6305840091,"An almost forgotten camp classic from the 60's, and it should have stayed forgotten.  The movie has some force in the beginning, when we are introduced to the film's  premise of legalized murder and we are treated to Ursula Andress in a brassiere, but after that opening it becomes boring and clichd.  Yes, the idea of the contestants in the hunt filming each other with the idea of becoming celebrities maybe have been original in 1965, but we have seen media obsessiveness portrayed in countless movies since.  The film has some moments though, mostly involving eye popping colors and set decoration.  But the ultimate showdown between Mastroianni and Andress becomes too drawn out.",1419984000,2,684,5.017699115044247

1083833,4,6305840091,"I challenge any viewer to turn away from The 10th Victim having seen
the first five minutes. But the tantalizing opening sequences only hint
at the roller coaster ride that follows. The 10th Victim is a tale of two
beautiful people stalking each other across the world in a televised
game of legalized assassination. The payoff is worldwide fame and a
million dollars in prize money. It's a tender love story.

Marcello Mastroianni was a great and versatile actor, able to slide
from suave Euro lover to buffoon/heel effortlessly. The movies he made
with Sophia Loren should not be missed. Here he's paired with  icy
Ursula Andress, who's perfect for this role. To quote Mina who sings the
film's score: ""My lips are on fire, but they're made of ice!""",1414454400,,751,4.769230769230769
1083834,4,6305840091,"It's the future, which looks a lot like a more extreme late sixties, and Italian Marcello Poletti is SO done with women, and plain tired of life. American Caroline Meredith wants something, anything to excite her - she describes herself as ""an iceberg."" A computer in Geneva pairs the two of them. Not for a possible romance, but for murder - they are to be Victim and Hunter, respectively, for Caroline's tenth Hunt. The Great Hunt is a globally sanctioned contest that allows a legal, entertaining outlet for humanity's murderous impulses, and we watch the two main characters stalk each other through the streets and night spots of Rome. Cool, sexy, even romantic in the way only a late-60's Italian film can be, Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress plot, plan, double-cross and scheme right up until the final minutes of the film, in a flawed but entertaining romance/comedy/social satire. It scrapes classichood - if it had only been a bit more daring in the script and had a tighter ending. But it's worth repeat viewings - Cult film with a capital ""Cult."" The English version is good...the Italian just a touch better. Soundtrack cooler than mint gelato.",1401062400,,1164,4.913705583756345
1083835,5,6305840091,"In 1965 this was a humorous take on where the world would end up in the 21st century.  In the 21st century it is still humorous but also a bit shocking in how it foretold ""reality"" television, gun control (or the lack of it), and attitudes toward family, the elderly, and sex.
Always love Marcello and Ursula.  The only problem is that Conti never figured out a good ending, but that is only a few minutes of the film.  Watch, laugh, learn.",1398124800,,440,4.341463414634147
1083836,4,6305840091,"If you don't have a Blu-ray player and are still only using DVD, let me point out that the reissue of this film to DVD by Blue Underground is identical to the earlier Anchor Bay DVD...even down to the same onscreen menus.  (Although the Blue Underground packaging is a big step up.)  I have seen some online reviews listing the new DVD as only being in Italian with English subtitles, but that's not true.  Just like the Anchor Bay disc, this gives you the option of watching the film dubbed in English.

As for the Blu-ray, the film has never looked or sounded better.  It's almost like seeing the film for the first time.  Bonus features include two trailers, stills and poster gallery, and a second film (the feature-length documentary about the film's leading man, Marcello Mastroianni, MARCELLO: A SWEET LIFE).  The only quibble about the Blu-ray is that there must have been a slight problem with either the source material or the transfer process.  One sequence has a tight shot of a gun aimed right at the camera.  When the trigger is pulled the gun makes a ""popping"" sound as a bouquet of flowers pop out and fill the screen.  While the scene plays correctly on both DVD versions, on the Blu-ray the close-up of the gun uses a freeze frame for some reason.  We hear the pop and, after a brief pause, the film resumes and the flowers rush out.  There should be no delay between the popping sound and the flowers popping out.  Why this sequence is presented properly on the DVDs but not on Blu-ray is unexplainable and inexcusable.  Were it not for this oversight, I would have readily given this five stars instead of four.",1394755200,4,1631,4.5793103448275865
1083837,3,6305840091,"I didn't remember caring much for this film when it first came out, and time hasn't helped it one bit.  Ursula Andress looks fantastic, and is the only reason to watch it, IMO.  The sound track is so grating, I had to mute it at times.  The basic storyline has been done many times, in variations, and better.  Very 1960's.  It did not age well.  Not much new, not much to like.  It's an odd period piece, and interesting for that, but not very entertaining.",1394409600,,458,4.317647058823529
1083879,5,6305840091,"The first and only time I saw ""The 10th Victim"" was at the theatre when it was released in 1965 and I was an impressionable young teenager. I liked the film so well at the time that I went out and bought the soundtrack album. Yes, it's a vinyl record. You remember those--big, flat, round disks of shiny black plastic with shallow grooves on each side. While jazz is a musical genre that I truly despised back then and still do today, for some reason the ""futuristic jazz"" music in ""The 10th Victim"" resonated with me. I still have the album. I also have Robert Sheckley's short story, ""The Seventh Victim,"" on which the film is loosely based.

So how has ""The 10th Victim"" held up over the intervening 50 years since its cinematic release? Ursula Andress, of course, is still stunning. My pubescent crush on her, stoked by her appearance in a 1963 ""Playboy"" that I stashed under my mattress, had a lot to do with my original interest in this film. The cinematography is great, with excellent use of lighting, color and camera angles to add a near-future ambience to the Italian locations where the film was shot. The soundtrack is as good as I remember, and not at all annoying to my ears as any other type of jazz music would be. My biggest surprise in watching ""The 10th Victim"" again for the first time in 49 years is that there's considerably more depth to it than I remember, and it's a lot funnier than I recall. When I first saw it, I was not sophisticated enough to grasp or appreciate the subtle cultural, social, moral, religious and sexual humor that pervades it. It really is a funny film--I laughed out loud several times, and its entire irreverent tone mind-melds nicely with my current relatively cynical outlook on life.

I found two unexpected disturbing elements in ""The 10th Victim"" this time around that I didn't remember. I won't mention them, because both would be considered spoilers, and most viewers probably won't mind them anyway. One bothered me enough that I considered knocking off a star for it. But then I realized that both of these elements accurately reflect the societal conditions of the mid-1960s, and it would be unfair to penalize the film for correctly portraying the realities of the time. So no harm, no foul--""The 10th Victim"" is a five-star virtuoso depiction of a strange but logically consistent near-future world with its roots firmly planted in the 1960s. I recommend it highly.",1391558400,4,2428,4.697183098591549

1083881,5,6305840091,"This is one of the great oddball films of all time: a collision between Fellini, James Bond and sci-fi which is solidly a product of its amazing era.  Its still relatively obscure, despite a handful of references to it in the Austin Powers movies.  Andress and Mastroianni are at the height of their beauty, and are dubbed by the familiar voices who did most of their English language movies.  It's tremendously goofy fun and yet still a pretty sharp and accurate satire.  And it has one of the most insane yet catchy musical scores ever.",1387497600,,538,4.631578947368421
1083882,2,6305840091,"A catastrophic misfire on all levels, Director Elio Petri's The 10th Victim should be shown in film schools across the world as part of a course elective called ""Everything That Is Wrong With Italian '60s pop art Cinema"".

It isn't interesting, it isn't engaging and it isn't remotely frightening, it isn't Futuristic, it isn't sci-fi, and it isn't a dark comedy.

1083883,5,6305840091,"I've loved this movie since I first saw it many years ago. It is now ""high camp"". I still love it. It gives you the flavor of the 60s European sci fi. A real classic. Mastroiani at his best.",1371945600,,190,3.8974358974358974

You may have difficulty getting the goofy, repetitive theme out of your head afterwords, but that makes The 10th Victim all the more endearing.",1364860800,,407,4.589041095890411
1083887,4,6305840091,Nice example of 60's film style. Futuristic setting with morality tale of dubious impact. Ursula is appropriately clothed and therefore visually stunning. Marcello has good contrasting role to some of his Fellini characters.,1361664000,3,224,5.818181818181818
1083888,4,6305840091,"Sometime in the future (after the Fourth World War - or perhaps the Sixth - according to one of the trailers), humanity has decided that it must forever put an end to war.  Understanding that violence is a part of human nature, society has decided to make that aggression legal with something called the Great Hunt, in which Hunter and Victim can legally do each other in.  Each participant alternates being Hunter and Victim.  Each can legally kill each other (though if one kills the wrong person, it's 30 years behind bars), and if one survives ten hunts, as only 15 have done - well, the rewards are many.

I have an interest in comedies, futuristic films and Italian films from the `60s and `70s, so when I read about this film that fits into all three categories, I couldn't resist - and the film definitely pays off!  Ursula Andress and Marcello Mastroianni star respectively as Caroline Meredith, an American who has just survived her ninth hunt and is now pursuing the magic ""tenth victim,"" and Marcello Poletti, a blond-haired Italian participant who seems to be just trying to survive his life, with a nagging mistress (the beautiful Elsa Martinelli) and an ex-wife who collects and spends his paychecks.

Director Elio Petri directs this 1965 film in tongue-in-cheek fashion, showing us a world that we would see again in movies like ""Sleeper"" (mechanical pets), ""Logan's Run"" (senior citizens must be handed over to the state), ""Austin Powers"" (bullet-spitting bras) and ""The Running Man"" (violence as entertainment).

Though mostly set in and around Rome, the film actually begins in New York City, where we see a man chasing after and shooting at a dark-haired young woman in lower Manhattan.  At one point, she seems to be almost toying with him coyly, finally running into a club into which the man follows.  Little does he know what fate awaits him as we see Ms. Andress do a sexy striptease, slapping all of the men in the face as they get close to her.  In a later sequence, we see beautiful shots of Rome filmed from a helicopter and are reminded by the Colosseum that bloodsport is nothing new.

In this future, the survivors of the hunts are courted by the media as celebrities, with corporate sponsors setting up executions on live television to boost their products. All of this could have been handled in a serious manner, but this film is a lot of fun, with armed men brandishing guns being told by a waiter that they can't kill anybody in bars (legal in the US but illegal in Italy) and a successful hunter who just killed a victim getting a parking ticket for blocking the entrance to a building.  The fashion is 1960's futuristic, but of course, the cars are not (nor is the airline, Pan American).

So, if you like your futuristic films with a comic twist, definitely give this film a try, and welcome to a world of exploding boots, ejector seats, roadside sex stops and armored skin.  It will be worth it.

As for the presentation, I watched the blu-ray released by Blue Underground.  The film is presented in a 1:1.78 widescreen ratio, with good colors and a sharp picture, though grain from the film is often noticeable.  It includes Italian and English soundtracks, and I watched with the Italian track and English subtitles.  Extras include the Italian and American trailers, with still photo galleries of the film's publicity material and of Marcello Mastroianni.

The biggest extra, however, is a feature length documentary, ""A Sweet Life,"" about the life and career of Mr. Mastroianni.  In Italian with English subtitles, it includes vintage interviews with the actor as well as people such as Sophia Loren, Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti, as well as more recent talks with the actor's two daughters and film world people like Claudia Cardinale and Anouk Aimee.  It's informative and entertaining (a lot of people thought he was lazy, though he never retired from acting; he loved pasta fagioli and Claudia Cardinale; and when not actually doing filming, he was constantly on the phone), though at 98 minutes it feels a bit on the long side.",1356825600,,4087,4.801711840228245

1083921,3,6305840091,"This film is fresh from the 1960's, a Carlo Ponti film.  Carlo had Sophia Loren for some time so he was no stranger to beauty.  Ursula Andress was one of the great European seductresses in the 1960's and 1970's.  If you are a fan of hers, her role basically is a scene right out of Austin Powers in the 1st four minutes where she struts her stuff in a metallic bikini and then, right out of Powers, removes a foe with her deadly upper bikini guns.  Though Ursula was nonpareil as a beauty, the scene is better reprised by Austin Powers.
The film is typical of 1960's European spy fare: feather light plots with odd twists and campy 1960's clothing and 'mod behavior'.
If you absolutely love the craziness of Euro films from the 60's, or must have anything with Ursula Andress, then get this--otherwise look for better choices.",1344556800,,826,4.523489932885906
1083922,2,6305840091,"I enjoy Italian films, and I enjoy Ursula Andress.  From the cover of the box, I thought I'd get to see Ursula naked in the film.  She comes close during her strip at the beginning of the film, but never does get naked.  The film is a sci-fi/fantasy about a world where instead of war, people can relieve their agressions by registering as hunters.  Hunters try to kill other hunters.  A hunter who successfully kills 10 other hunters, can retire very rich.  Once registered as a hunter, a person either kills 10 other hunters or is killed--they cannot leave the game.  Hunts are televised world-wide.  Ursula's 10th victim is Marcello Mastrianni (spelling?), and they fall in love.  I found the story to be rather silly, and was disappointed in there being no nudity in this film.",1323043200,3,781,4.6838235294117645
1083923,4,6305840091,"This a poignant film--touching and sad--and  full of fun at the same time; a classic film, for sure; and a film only Italians could have made. The director, Elio Petri, is often quoted: ""Making a movie needs a lot of madness and a lot of love for cinema. And most probably this is the most positive side of the whole matter.""

The director, Petri was a lawyer turned filmmaker, a leftist, vocal member of the Communist Party, a rascal, and a man totally aware of the mission of filmmaking: it's a vehicle for entertainment first and along the way you spice it up with politics. Candy with  medicine hidden inside.
The 10th Victim is a visual delight, the costumes and art design, the attractive stars--a young, blonde Marcello Mastrioinani and sex goddess Ursula Andress. Everything is done up deliciously 60s : pop-art, futuristic furniture, Sassoon haircuts, fake eyelashes, clothes with cut out backs and zippers everywhere, fantastic hats and visors. Most of the action happens in Rome and there's no tourists, in fact, the streets and sites are empty, no Vespas, no graffiti. On a stretch, the telephones and video screens in the film could still seem contemporary today. The director made a wise choice not to include close-ups of electronic gadgetry and that decision allowed the the film to age beautifully.

Quick synopsis: It's the future. War and violent impulses have been replaced by a game where one aggressive person hunts and murders another. It's a safety valve After succeeding in ten computer-generated match-ups, the last killer-survivor becomes a celebrity.  In the film Marcello is the hunted and Andress is the hunter. Of course they fall in love--in a twisted futuristic way that  asks, why tell the truth?  Relationships are all filled with deception.

The story lampoons marriage, commitment, honesty, the media, people's hunger for fame and celebrity, and greed in an intellectual way that is as valid today as it might have been for farsighted for Petri back in 1965 when he made the film.

I was wowed not only by Rome's empty streets but also the sound of crickets in the Colosseum, the jazzy-pop soundtrack, the frequent futuristic predictions about homosexual liberation and, most surprised by the right-on appearance of the Chinese  in this almost 50 year old sci-fi spoof) as being the nation who ends up with the most money.  The Chinese give prize money to the winners and promote their product during broadcasts of the hunt. ""Drink MIng Tea and Live Forever.""

How did he figure that out about China?  Petri was a genius!

Why could only an Italian make this film?  Who else could make a film about the role of money, schizophrenia and the individual's destruction and make it sexy, adult and stylish?

Sad? Because there are so few people in the future, it must mean there was a terrible war and not many people survived and the ones who did stay home and watch TV shows about the hunters and hunted and drink Ming Tea.

1083924,5,6305840091,"Ever since catching about a half hour of The 10th Victim in bleary black-and-white on television as a teenager I had been dying to see the whole film. So when Anchor Bay released it on DVD in 2001 I jumped on it and have watched it at least four times since. It's become one of my all-time favorite movies, a superbly written, directed, and designed combination of futuristic thriller, sex farce, and dark, dryly witty satire--all wrapped up in a colorful, surreal pop/op-art package--that pokes fun at a dystopian future where war has been replaced by the ""sport"" of legalized murder (""the Big Hunt""), comic books are regarded as ""Classics,"" elderly parents must be turned in to the state for extermination, and advertisers sign up ""hunters"" to promote their products during live commercials featuring cold-blooded killings.

Ursula Andress (at the peak of her beauty and animal sensuality) and Marcello Mastroianni (the epitome of jaded cool) play hunter and victim, respectively, both vying for a million-dollar prize if one can murder the other, and each also lining up a corporate sponsor who will pay out if the killing can be timed to happen during a live commercial for their product. But love, of all things, intervenes (not to mention his ex-wife and mistress), seriously complicating their cat-and-mouse game of death. Along the way we are treated to some great futuristic pop-art set designs and decor, terrific, catchy Eurojazz soundtrack, and breezy satire of the media, society's fetishization of violence, religion, marriage and divorce, Bondian intrigue, television, and shameless, opportunistic corporate advertising. Several future fads are accurately predicted, including robotic pets and tawdry reality TV shows, and a number of elements from the film are recognizable as being ""borrowed"" by Mike Myers for the Austin Powers movies, most notably Andress's ballistic bikini top.

I have found that The 10th Victim actually improves with each viewing, as each time I pick up on more details or bits of dialogue that had previously escaped me. *Spoiler Alert* The only disappointing aspect of the film, in my opinion, is the ""comic,"" slapstick ending tacked on at the insistence of American distributor Joseph E. Levine. I'm about 99% sure that the movie is really supposed to end just after Mastroianni shoots Andress, but Levine apparently considered that ending too downbeat. It's pretty obvious that the final scenes amid some ruins and on an  airplane were added after the fact as they are completely at odds with the tone of the rest of the movie and attempt to provide the film with a wacky, screwball ""happy ending."" But other than the denouement ringing false, the film is nearly perfectly realized.

When I heard that Blue Underground was releasing this on Blu-ray I wondered if it would really be worth the price of an upgrade. Thankfully, the answer is a resounding ""yes!"" The brightness, color saturation and balance, sharpness, and detail are vastly improved over the Anchor Bay DVD. While the word ""revelation"" gets thrown around perhaps a bit too freely when describing Blu-rays in comparison with their previous DVD incarnations, in this case it is apropos. The BU transfer makes the Anchor Bay disc look positively sick in comparison--dark and muddy, with faded, poorly balanced color and mushy detail. The difference here is literally like night and day; it's astounding how much better the Blu-ray looks when compared side-by-side with the DVD. The 1080p transfer does bring out the grain a bit, but never to the point of distraction. Fleshtones are natural, detail is crisp, and the muted hues of the Anchor DVD give way to sizzling, neon-vivid greens, yellows, and fuchsias. If you are a big fan of this movie, you really need to upgrade to the Blu-ray; it's almost like seeing the film again for the first time, and easily the biggest improvement in a Blu-ray over a previous DVD release I have yet seen. (Note that Blue Underground's 2009 DVD release is merely a repackage of the Anchor Bay edition, so the Blu-ray is the only way to see the much-improved remaster.)

Blue Underground also up the ante with some enticing supplements, including a somewhat washed-out U.K. release trailer (1:47), which is the same one as on the Anchor DVD, and a superior, gorgeous-looking Italian trailer (2:31), with English subtitles, that actually gives you a much better idea of what the movie's about than the rather inscrutable U.K. trailer (both are presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen). A gallery of stills, posters, and pressbook art and a Mastroianni still gallery are also present, as well as an hour-and-a-half documentary on Mastroianni (which I haven't watched yet). But even without these extras, the far superior transfer makes this a more than worthy upgrade. If you love this film as much as I do, I guarantee you will be delighted.",1317772800,15,4881,5.073474470734745
1083925,5,6305840091,"Synopsis: In the future a game called ""The Big Hunt"" where it is legal to commit murder has been created to help facilitate mankind's growing obsession with murder.

The 10th Victim was directed by Elio Petri, whose other notable films include The Lady killer of Rome, A Quiet Place in the Country and Investigation of a Citizen... Above Suspicion. The screenplay for The 10th Victim was adapted from the Robert Sheckley story titled ""The Seventh Victim"". The Cinematographer on The 10th Victim was Gianni Di Venanzo whose impressive filmography includes Il grido, Big Deal on Madonna Street, La note, L'eclisse, Federico Fellini's 8 and Juliet of the Spirits. After The 10th Victim Gianni Di Venanzo would only work on one more film before his untimely death at the age of forty five. The score for The 10th Victim was composed by Piero Piccioni, whose other notable scores include Duel of the Titans, The Lady killer of Rome, La commare secca (The Grim Reaper), Contempt (The Italian and Spanish versions), The Nuns of Saint Archangel and Story of a Cloistered Nun.

The plot focuses primarily on two characters Marcello Polletti and Caroline Meredith who are both participating in ""The Big Hunt"". Marcello is the hunted as Caroline in the hunter in seek of her 10th victim. She soon discovers that he is not as an easy target as her previous victims as he leads her around on a series of misadventures as he tries to figure out who she is and what she wants. This cat and mouse game that evolves between these two characters is the most enjoyable part of the film.

This film takes full advantage of the Rome locations in the film. All of the sets used are all beautifully designed and realized. The film features a solid performance from Marcello Mastroianni in the role of Marcello Polletti charismatic character that in many ways resembles his own persona. Cast opposite of Marcello Mastroianni in the role of Caroline Meredith is Swedish sex icon Ursula Andress. While she is more than serviceable in the role one has to wonder if the original choice for the role Ann-Margret would have been the better suited for this role. Early on in the film there is a scene with Ursula Andress that obviously inspired the machine gun breast assassins from the Austin Powers International Man of Mystery films. Ultimately The 10th Victim is an exceptional satire that hasn't lost any of its charm or relevance.

The BluRay:

The 10th Victim comes on a 50 GB dual layer BluRay. The film is presented in a 1080 progressive anamorphic widescreen. Colors look vibrant, flesh tones look accurate, black levels look very good and details look sharp throughout. There is a healthy layer of grain and there are no problems with compression. When compared to previous North American home video releases of The 10th Victim, this brand new transfer from Blue Underground looks amazing.

This release comes with two audio options, a DTS-HD Mono mix in English and a DTS-HD Mono mix in Italian. Both audio are in good shape as dialog is always clear and everything sounds balanced. The score benefits most from these audio mixes and the more ambient aspects of the soundtrack are well represented. This release comes with four subtitle options, English, English SDH, French and Spanish. Also the English subtitles appear to be a direct translation of the Italian audio track, while the English SDH subtitle is a direct translation of the English audio track.

Extras for this release include the U.S. theatrical release trailer (1 minute 47 seconds - anamorphic widescreen), the Italian theatrical release trailer (2 minutes 31 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, with English subtitles), a poster & still gallery for the film, a Marcello Mastroianni still gallery and a feature length documentary about Marcello Mastroianni titled `Marcello: A Sweet Life' (98 minutes 15 seconds - 4:3 Full Frame / Letterboxed Widescreen, with English subtitles). This is a superb documentary that not only covers all the major films that Marcello Mastroianni, it also features an abundance of comments about who he was outside of cinema. All of his main collaborators make appearances in this documentary, whether it be newly recorded interviews or from archive footage, all of  Marcello Mastroianni's comments come from archive footage. This documentary also features comments from his two daughters and his brother Ruggero Mastroianni, a noted film editor. Overall The 10th Victim gets an exceptional release from Blue Underground.

It deals with life in the future where there are no more wars, but because people are still violent they are allowed to join a game where participants are allowed to kill each other for sport and money. The story is reminiscent of movies like Death Race 2000 and Running Man. Ursula Andress is great in this movie. Her character is beautiful and genuine.

Think American Idol, Survivor, and Big Brother all together with guns.  The idea is simple; you join the game and must live ten encounters.  Each time you survive, as either the hunter or victim, you get money.  And if you survive 10 hunts, you get a million dollars and discounts and free stuff.  You're set up for life, in other words.  If you live on bread and don't want a house.  A million? Blah!  Where was I?  Oh yes...
It seems to be a world wide game, so I wonder if there is a world government or a new culture or what?  Sun worship and Moon worship and no wars.  It is the 21st Century and Pan-Am is still around.

1083929,2,6305840091,"The mid-60's was near the peak of the Bond inspired spy movie craze.  These films ranged from deadly serious espionage thrillers, to those that spoofed the phenomenon.  Producer Carlo Ponti, and director Elio Petri, intended that the film La Decimal Vittima (1965), aka The 10th Victim, to be an adventure/comedy.  Something of a period piece, it is an offbeat semi-serious tale, with some elements of dark humor and self-mockery.

An ""enlightened"" society has instituted the ""Big Hunt"", an international, government sanctioned program, where ""hunters"" are assigned ""victims"", that they attempt to kill.  Hunters that successfully accomplish ten kills, are awarded a million dollars.  In New York, sexy Caroline Meredith (Ursula Andress) has just completed her ninth kill, dispatching her latest victim with a loaded bra.  While Marcello Polletti (Marcello Mastroianni), has just notched his sixth kill, using an explosive set of boots.  With each awaiting their next assignment, a computer in Geneva determines that Ms. Meredith shall be Mr. Polletti`s hunter.

By rule, players are notified when they have been selected as a victim.  So at home in Rome, Polletti has been alerted.  On the verge of becoming a millionaire, Meredith's tenth kill becomes an event with commercial backing, from the Ming Tea Company.  The production team arrives in Rome, and selects the Temple of Venus, as the scene for Polletti's elaborate and profitable demise.

The film follows the developing relationship, between a suspicious and unsure Polletti, and Meredith, who is posing as a journalist seeking an interview.  Also in the mix are Polletti's ex-wife Lidia (Luce Bonifassy), his current lover Olga (Elsa Martinelli), and his attorney Rossi (Massimo Serato).  Polletti seems to be ahead of the game, and has plans to turn the tables on Meredith, but things do not quite go as planned.

While examining a fictional society with unusual morals, the film also explores real world social issues like marriage, commercialism, aging, cultism, and human relationships.  There are also some examples of mod 60's fashion, and a mostly light and breezy, but persistent soundtrack.

This DVD release is dubbed in Italian and English, and has English subtitles.  Watching the film with both the English dub and subtitles on, makes for an interesting experience, as the translations between the two isn't always in synch.  The video quality is average, and has a vintage look, with the colors shaded toward yellow.  The movie features gunshots cues that must be standard for Italian films, as they sound exactly like those from a Sergio Leone spaghetti western.

This is a film with more style than substance, that certainly could have been more profound.  Apparently Marcello Mastroianni, was not entirely pleased, with the fluffy conclusion, that leaves some core issues unresolved.  The film loses much of the edge it begins with, becoming more of a fencing match, between stars Mastroianni and Andress, who try to make the best of what they are given.  Those looking for an action film, will probably be disappointed.  The 10th Victim, might best be appreciated by 60's nostalgia fans, with a mild taste for intrigue, and Italian style romance comedy.",1273104000,2,3232,5.251461988304094
1084017,5,6305840091,"I honestly don`t know if the other reviewers saw the same film I did, but I have owned the original, Anchor Bay release for years, and haven`t seen the re-release - maybe something was cut, maybe the previous reviewers don`t get 60`s Euro-cult films like ""Danger Diabolik"", ""Fathom"", ""I`ll Never Forget What`s Isname"", ""Modesty Blaise"" or, for that matter, ""Our Man Flint/In Like Flint"", or ""Deadlier than The Male"". With the international sucess of the Bond films, there weren`t enough films of this type to satisfy audience hunger, hence all of the above, and although are flawed (as are the bond films), these flicks filled the void rather nicely. This one in particular, for it`s Madison Avenue corporate tie-ins to everything from arena sports endorsements to Rock concert sponsorships that are now a permanent part of our lives, it`s actually spot-on in it`s comedic absurdity and a harbinger of all things to come. And we`re only a step away from televised executions in one form or another...  Both Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress are superb in their roles, especially Mastroianni in his world-weary approach to his lifestyle and profession, and the subtle humor and ironies are abundant everywhere in this film. Elsa Martinelli is hysterical as well as adorable, so if you think the ""Austin Powers"" franchise is good (if you`re under 40), and like any of the 60`s flix I referenced above(if you`re slightly older), do yourself a favor and get this film.

Given it's timeliness, the picture seems due for a remake.  (If it were it would probably be dubbed a rip-off of Mr. & Mrs. Smith which it closely resembles.  Indeed, the ideas and details here have been picked pretty clean over the years.)  This isn't a masterpiece, and some bits miss the target, but it's fast-paced and pretty interesting.

1084022,4,6305840091,"According to film lore, actor Marcello Mastroianni was so impressed with a short-story by science-fiction author Robert Sheckley that he sent it to director Elio Petri. The result was a groundbreaking Italian film that alternately shocked and amused audiences of 1965--and which, like the 1976 NETWORK, proved prophetic re the rise of ""reality television.""

Set in a future imagined in terms of minimalist 1960s fashion and design movements, THE 10TH VICTIM (LA DECIMA VITTIMA) presents us with a world that has subliminated the human race's hunger for violence into a game known as ""The Big Hunt."" Register as a member and you become preditor and prey, with each player seeking to survive while killing ten others in order to win fame, fortune, and national acclaim.

American Caroline Meredith (Ursla Andress) is particularly celebrated and--after dispatching her ninth victim via her boobytrapped bra--is eager to win the grand prize by taking out her tenth: Italian Marcello Polletti (Marcello Mastroianni.) But an advertiser promises her even bigger bucks if she can turn it into a television ad for his product, creating a situation in which Caroline cannot simply kill Marcello at will: she must do it at a particular place and time where the cameras will be rolling.

In order to accomplish this, Caroline decides to seduce Marcello with both her body and the lure of cash--which he badly needs--for a television interview. Marcello is no fool, and even as Caroline plans to blow his head off for benefit of television he's signing his own advertising deal to accomplish her death by crocodile. But there's a further complication: even as they attempt to manouver each other into death, they also unwillingly fall in love.

THE 10TH VICTIM was extremely celebrated in 1965; today, however, it reads as slightly thin. We've become used to the idea of people who are willing to do just about anything on television, and the idea of murder by game show isn't nearly so farfetched as it used to be. The film scores, however, in its specific ideas, which range from exploding boots to a government that occasionally switches out your apartment's furniture whether you like it or not. The DVD transfer is quite nice, but bonuses are limited to cast notes and the theatrical trailer. Recommended, but mainly for fans of 1960s futurism who haven't lost their sense of humor!

However, they don't have Ursula Andress and Marcello Mastroianni in it and that wonderful 60's wacky visual interpretation of what the future would look like.

Will it ever go this far on tv to satisfy the ever increasing and by the media itself ever stimulated need for thrills and kicks, without which people don't seem to be able to sense they're alive anymore or so we're given to believe? The cynical me and optimistic me have not finished that debate as yet to give an answer.

1084118,3,6305840091,"I'm a big fan of films dealing with socially sanctioned violence set in the future. The 1960s and 1970s saw a bunch of movies that fit this category, movies like ""Rollerball,"" ""Soylent Green,"" and a dozen others. It's interesting how many filmmakers see the future as a bleak, nihilistic place where humanity has little hope for a happy life. Perhaps it had something to do with crises of the times. One of the worrisome themes in the 1960s and 1970s was the threat of global overpopulation. Paul Ehrlich wrote his doom and gloom book about the dangers of too many people and too few resources, ""The Population Bomb,"" in 1968. The Italian film ""The 10th Victim,"" proves that this concern was in the air even earlier. I wonder why the western world suddenly adopted such an attitude at this particular time? Did it have something to do with attempting to overcome opposition to new methods of birth control, in particular the pill? Or was it the start of what would become a dismal economic reality in the 1970s? Who knows? Whatever the case, Anchor Bay decided to release ""The 10th Victim"" on DVD a couple of years ago, about the time I first learned of the movie. I recently tracked down a copy and gave it a watch.

In the world depicted in this film, an out of control birth rate requires the authorities to take drastic steps to prune back the demand for such necessities as food and water. It's decided to create a game televised around the world, a game where contestants volunteer to kill ten other people over the course of a few years in the hopes that they will win the whopping sum of a million dollars. The rules of the game prevent wide scale anarchy by placing limits on how and when the assassinations can occur. A player does not, for example, simply run outside and mow down ten people. Instead, a computer system contains the files of all contestants and randomly pairs off contestants. In some instances, a player is a target. After awhile, if they stay alive long enough, they become the hunter. Moreover, certain places around the world are off limits to killing, such as the headquarters of the company that runs the game. If you murder someone in one of these zones, your game and your life become forfeit. Sounds like fun, right? Just like any other human endeavor, some people are better at killing under these rules than others. Two of the best players, Marcello Polletti (Marcello Mastroianni) and Caroline Meredith (Ursula Andress), garner a lot of attention with their antics. Meredith manages to gun down a target in a most, ahem, unusual way at the beginning of the film.

Polletti seems weary of the whole game, though. His relationship with his wife has soured in recent months, and when she leaves him she takes all of his stuff. Personal problems aside, Polletti knows he must continue playing the game; he really has no choice in the matter, actually. If he refuses to find out who is hunting him, he'll die rather quickly. Predictably, Caroline Meredith is the one assigned to ending Polletti's life, leading to lengthy scenes where the woman attempts to ingratiate herself into Marcello's good graces. Why doesn't she just pop a pill in him and be done with it? Because a tea company signed a contract with the beautiful assassin that will pay off big time if she can lure Polletti in front of a camera before delivering the coup de grace. In short, this company wants to turn Meredith's final kill into a live television commercial complete with product placement. As Marcello and Caroline test each other's wits, the countdown to the kill draws ever closer. Unfortunately, the two complicate matters by falling in love. Will Caroline Meredith succeed in winning the one million dollar bounty? Will Marcello discover just how devious his foe really is in time to save his life? Will you care?

The answer to the last question depends greatly on how much 1960's European cinematic cheese your system can handle. Expect a lot of VERY '60's set pieces and costumes in this film. There are so many horribly dated visuals going on this movie that I kept expecting Goldie Hawn and Arte Johnson to caper on camera. That club and dance scene in the opening frames alone left me wondering just how people survived that decade in one piece. ""The 10th Victim"" is so awfully dated that it's almost impossible to focus on the plot, a plot that unfortunately goes nowhere after the first twenty or thirty minutes. Why did the filmmakers decide to spend so much time on Polletti's marital woes? Repeatedly, this subplot pops up in ways that detract from the larger narrative. And while I liked the underlying theme to the whole sun cult thing, i.e. Marcello playing on his fame as an assassin to make more money, this subplot didn't help the film in any substantive way. The conclusion to the film is unsatisfactory yet predictably European: what was that explosion of flowers supposed to signify? That love and death are intimately linked? Again, who knows?

I probably wouldn't recommend ""The 10th Victim"" to most people. Mastroianni fans will definitely want to own a copy, although I thought his performance was horribly stilted and uninspiring. Andress fans (and there are Andress fans) will also wish to pick up this disc, even though her turn as the dangerous Caroline Meredith could have been done equally well by any big name actress of the time. Too bad they didn't get Sophia Loren to play the part. As for me, I'm going to stick with Heston's ""Soylent Green"" histrionics and Jimmy Caan's rough and tumble demeanor in ""Rollerball"" in the foreseeable future.

1084119,4,6305840091,"This movie was made on VERY inexpensively, but a lot was made from that frugality! Marcello Mastroanni and Ursula Andress star in this sly satire on violence and population control. Their characters live in a 21st century world where an international game of cowboys and indians using real bullets and lethal devices has been authorized by the world government. The story focuses on them as Marcello tries to avoid being killed by Ursula in a game that trades off hunter and victim roles in a series of ten alternating runs, where the winner is finally awarded one million dollars.

Marcello plays a laid-back pauper in the game with nowhere near the resources of his ""hunter"", a jetset-style adventuress played by Andress. It's a comedy of errors and sixities fad satire as repo men come to exact a pound of flesh for the money Marcello owes them from past hunts, and he pleads with them not to take his priceless comic book collection, which includes Tom & Jerrys and Bug Bunnys, as well as Flash Gordon Dell editions.

The climax of the movie takes place on the set of a commercial orchestrated by the Andress character, Caroline, AND Marcello, (same first name as his character,) where Marcello is to pitch ""Ming Tea"" to the masses as he nails Caroline, seemingly, on the set of the show SHE put together, assuming her OWN victory!

The movie has one of the coolest jazz scores you'll ever hear, scat sung by a woman named Mina, accompanied by that typical, modern, Felliniesque pop organ. Elio Petri directs the two international stars and manages to make Rome look like it is, indeed, in the 21st century without spending a cent on special effects. (The killer bra Andress uses to kill her ninth victim is about it on that score, as a matter of fact!)

Marcello plays his role VERY tongue in cheek and a scene where he conducts a sun worshipping ceremony is one of the funniest you'll see in a sixties film...the scene has a LOT of relevance to the faddish religious mindset of 70s, 80s and 90s California culture.

Ursula is existential window-dressing, playing her part very laconically, but it's the SUPPORTING players that add a lot to this flick: The moon worshippers, Marcello's old trainer, Elsa Martinelli as Marcello's mistress and the fellow playing Marcello's agent/physician being prime examples.

The DVD, however, has almost NO extras! Just a couple of trailers and talent bios...no commentary by Petri, no outtakes, no director's cut, no nothin', no foolin'! It's a good thing I didn't have to spend more than a 10-spot for this baby, lemme tell ya. However, it's a fine film that shows what you can do with a small amount of money and a lot of talent.

1084121,4,6305840091,"An early forerunner in the futuristic ""legalized-killing-as-TV-entertainment"" genre, The 10th Victim lays the groundwork for many subsequent films including Roller Ball, The Running Man, and most recently Daniel Minahan's Series 7: The Contenders.  Briefly summarized: in the 21st Century Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress are two all-star assassins pitted against each other in ""The Big Hunt,"" an international game of legalized murder in which a score of 10-kills awards the victor a prize of one million dollars.  What sets this film apart from the others is not so much the plot (as while it may be the original in concept, its followers certainly succeed better in overall craft and more pointed satire) as the permanent aesthetic time/date-stamp of 1960's camp.  The 10th Victim is a 60's version of the future, in the very best sense.  It's a future full of awesome color schemes, ultra-cool music, great furniture, swanky pads, and characters that just ooze with sexual energy.  The gem of this film is an opening sequence in which Andress dances around her ninth victim in a hipster club, fashionably slapping the men in the audience with cool and choreographed abandon before mowing down her adversary with bullets fired from a gun hidden in her bra (a gimmick later ripped for the Fembots in Austin Powers).  And while the film offers a couple of other moments that approach the brilliance of this opening, its full potential is never realized -- things are not pushed nearly far enough.  My biggest complaint: the alligator death chair catapult gizmo is never put to full effect, though perhaps I'm just yearning for the very thing this film means to comment on - more bloody spectacle.  All in all it's definitely worth seeing, though you might supplement it with a healthy dose of Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik for good measure.",1043020800,8,1847,5.052631578947368
1084122,5,6305840091,"...  Saw this great, snazzy, jazzy, production-designed-heaven back in '76 on a double bill ... and was never able to forget it. So thrilled it's on video. OK, a bit dated here and there, but in ways it is still ahead of its time, and its got that great Piero Piccioni space-jazz score with Mina doing scat vocals, AND its got Marcello at his most suave-cool since ""La Dolce Vita"", AND its got Ursula Andress shooting bullets from her bra!
...  As always, gli italiani were way ahead of us in style and attitude, and it's evidenced herein.
Only weak point of the film is the wrap-up, but such capers tended towards the flip in that day.  The 10th Victim and director Pietro Germi was certainly prescient ...

Until recently The 10th Victim has been worth seeing due to its strong futuristic aestetic value and black humor. However, now the theme of this movie can be seen in a new light. Today audiences - who are bored with staged nastyness - want to see the real thing. This they can find on a host of survival shows, where participants are encouraged to humiliate one another and themselves in various ways. One of the factors that has contributed to paving the way for such Reality TV are the many movies that predicted this form of entertainment. The 10th Victim is an early example.",1017187200,,793,4.753623188405797
1084124,4,6305840091,"I am amazed that this film does not have a dedicated following  (though,it may without my knowing it).
Here is a film which knits together many characteristics into a froth of insouciant fun. The music is retro, the costume design is
now, it makes fun of everything and everyone - including itself. The most appealing thing about this film is its tone. Underlying all the jabs at this group or that faction is an irrepressible joy.
The copies I have seen have all been dubbed in English rather than subtitled. This is another appealing quality. The fractured American English fits well with the satirical view of American Showbiz types. I usually distain dubbed soundtracks and favor subtitles so as to enjoy and savor the original language - even if I don't speak the language. This is the only film I know of which rises above such aesthetic quibbling.
Most important, though is intelligence mixed with joy joy joy.",1002844800,,917,4.80379746835443
1084125,3,6305840091,"I had never heard of ""The Tenth Victim,"" and purchased it largely because it was directed by Elio Petri, whose ""Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion"" I greatly admire. One of many mid-sixties High Camp exercises (including other films like ""Modesty Blaise,"" and ""Arabesque,"" and television shows like ""The Avengers"") ""The Tenth Victim"" nonetheless has an edge to it that viewers familiar with Petri's other work will recognize.
The conceit here is that society has learned how to cope with violence by legalizing and regulating murder through a televised spectacle called ""The Big Hunt."" Ursula Andress is on the verge of becoming a ""decathalete,"" that is, someone who has successfully killed ten victims and who will be rewarded for her final kill with one million dollars. A blonde Marcello Mastroianni is her intended victim, but as Andress sets him up, she finds herself falling for him.
Or, at least in theory she does. Because the tone of the film allows nothing so simple as straightforward emotion. Everything is an excuse for deadpan, cynical irony, kinked up and fetishized with high style fashions and attitudes. ""Victim"" is practically the definition of chic, but Petri, a Communist, is hardly presenting these Voguish postures as innocent fun. There's a bite under the silly surfaces. No matter how sleek the images, the whole thing leaves an acrid aftertaste.
In fact, ""The Tenth Victim"" is obviously a critique of the kind of film of which it is itself an example: superficial, violent, in love with commodities, sadistic and irresponsible. It is thus grimly appropriate that Anchor Bay should promote it as ""The Original Sexy '60s Cult Classic."" Clearly they and many potential viewers think of this as a Camp vehicle to which all knowing PostModernists can feel smugly superior.
Do so at your own risk. You may find yourself the real joke.",997142400,3,1862,5.068403908794788
1084126,3,6305840091,"A curiosity has just popped out of the cellar of Anchor Bay : THE 10th VICTIM, an italian movie directed in 1965 by Elio Petri. Adapted from a short novel of Robert Sheckley by the well-known screenplay writer Tonino Guerra, THE 10th VICTIM presents a Marcello Mastroianni with blond hair and an Ursula Andress with blond skin. Amusing.
The action takes place in a near future in Rome, Italy. In order to prevent wars, governments have invented "" The Big Hunting "". The players must win 10 times to gain the right to leave with a million dollars prize. In this game, to win means to kill the hunted if you are the hunter or to discover and kill the hunter if you're the hunted. A slight pre-RUNNING MAN flavour, isn't it ?
THE 10th VICTIM is more a parodical and satirical comedy than an action movie and presents at least one scene deserving to stay in our memories, the first scene involving a masked Ursula Andress dancing and slapping the faces of the ""Masoch Club"" male audience before killing her adversary in a very stylish manner.
If you like italian comedies or a smart satire of the television, religion or our political institutions, the movie is certainly worth a look. If, like me, you are an amateur of B movies of the sixties, THE 10th VICTIM is a must have.
Bonus features include an english dubbed version, the italian version with optional english subtitles, the theatrical trailer and an incomplete filmography of Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress. Great images and sound.

The premise of sublimated, sanctioned violence is literally blared over the PA system, but it's the rest of the social commentary (much of which even undercuts the premise) that pops up through off-hand scenes, sight gags and unexpected dialog which gives the film its depth. The tone reminded me of ""The President's Analyst"" more than anything else. Suffers slightly if you've seen too many films which cover the same themes, but try to remember that most of them were made later.",1523491200,,534,4.8791208791208796

7896509,1,6305840091,"When I started watching the 10th Victim, I had high expectations. A movie staring Marcello Mastroianni, one of my all-time favorite actors with great acting ability, good looks, and a mellifluous voice; a movie in Italy made by Italians in my favorite language; a film in one of my favorite genres, science fiction. But as it turned out, Mastroianni's looks were ruined by portraying a bleached blond; his acting talents were never put to use; and his voice belonged to another, English-speaking actor's. Dubbing the film from Italian to English was a crime against nature--all nature except for that of unschooled, lazy Americans. Ant then there is the plot... It started with some humorous exchanges in a very 1960s surrealist script, but then it got consumed by the love affair of Mastroianni and Ursula Andress, with zero chemistry between them. (The only way she can earn a living through acting is as Arsula Undress.) With Elsa Martinelli (a much better choice than Undress for Marcello's love partner) totally wasted as an actress, and a script that was equal parts silly and ridiculous, this movie, produced by Sophia Loren's husband, deserves oblivion. 1/2 star",1476662400,,1170,5.067357512953368
