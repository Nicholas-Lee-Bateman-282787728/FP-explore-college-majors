1563313,5,B00005JPID,"This film is superb and I think little known as politically incorrect. Policy today, and ever at times of making this movie, wants to show all things in life, even the bad ones, have a solution, and a reasonable one, generally.
But Sam Fuller is wise and I think very experienced and his best and perhaps less commercial films, he show us there are good things in life, but there are also bad facets, and some have no solution. Not one humane solution at less, and simply you can convert a tiger in a sheep.
This is the case in this movie, with the real problem of racism at bottom. Racism is considered a vice to eradicate in mankind, but this ""White Dog"" show us in a very believable way there are things out of our capacity.
The plot is: a young white girl is fiercely defended from a intent of rape by a strong attack dog. The girl cares grateful of these apparently abandoned dog, a magnificent obedient animal. But one day there appear a black person and the dog attacks furiously. The girl is astonished as the incident repeats. She consults with some experts in animals who train them for circus, etc. The diagnostic is clear: the dog is a ""White Dog"", this is, a dog trained viciously for a cruel master to hate,  attack and kill to black people. The main expert affirms from the beginning there are no cure for such criminal dogs, but a black employee wants to  try and extirpate racism from the dog's brain.
That attempt has to cost interminable training sessions in a jail with protection against the fierce attacks of the dog, but when all seems useless, the dog finish in an apparent appeasement and ceases in attacking the black man.
The big deception is from there, the dog attacks white people; his racism is the same, only has changed the objective. Fascinating,  magnificent film.",1202947200,5,1799,4.546296296296297

=====================
Well, better late than never!!! Criterion is FINALLY releasing White Dog December 2008!!! Not in Blu-ray but that's okay, this will be the best release ever available in any format to date.  Highest Recommendation!

* ADDENDUM * 08-28-2007:
=====================
Well, apparently Televista releases mostly VHS quality rips without any thought to quality, so this release of White Dog may turn out to be a real dog after all.  Too bad.  I'd change my rating but it doesn't appear to be an option.

Hopefully Criterion will release White Dog soon.

* Original review * 08-26-2007:
========================
DISCLAIMER: I don't believe in rating an item that hasn't even been released yet, but since Amazon insists on a rating before allowing a post and since several people to date have already rated it ONE STAR without actually seeing the product, I can only in all fairness give it FIVE STARS in an attempt to balance out the inequity at play.

Why does the Televista release of White Dog get slammed (before it's even released) and not the only other version currently listed on Amazon - which does seem to be a bootleg (search on 'white dog' to see it) and has 5 stars based on 1 review from the vendor themselves.

The Televista is advertised as uncut but the 1.33:1 aspect ratio disturbs me a little since the film was 1.85:1.  At any rate, I haven't seen any *official* word from Criteria as to a release date for White Dog, and the last thing I did see was the following response by them to a member of the Criterion forum: ""We do hope to get to 'White Dog' at some point, but there isn't a release date scheduled at this time.""

Searching the Internet on 'Televista' reveals a checkered past with several hits and misses, but it seems legit and then searching on 'White Dog' and 'Televista' together gets a lot of hits of the title currently being available for pre-order on *many* reputable sites in addition to Amazon.  I'd say the Televista should be worth a rental, at least, and that Criterion should jump on releasing White Dog ASAP given the Samuel Fuller 'revival' and all the great Fuller releases that have been coming out lately.",1188086400,7,2194,4.762532981530343

They would not give me a firm date when their DVD will be released, but I'm sure it will be worth the wait. Anyone willing to take a chance and purchase this version is welcome, and perhaps someone can write a review of this DVD version.

I'll wait for the Criterion release.

An update for August 29, 2007: Criterion stated in their newsletter that they will release their version of White Dog in 2008. No word on extras yet.

1563419,5,B00005JPID,"This story was fascinating, from beginning to end.

This was a true story, and I am always looking for a good true story.

And I love Kristy McNichol.

S P O I L E R S ..

Some things did not make sense to me..

First. Did anyone notice that the dog did not have a name?
Kristy McNichol's character never named him, she just kept calling him ""the dog.""
At the point when she decided that she wanted to keep him, one of the very first things that she should have done was give him a name.
When the original owner showed up with his two granddaughters, they never said a name either.
One of the granddaughters just called him ""my dog.""
When the black trainer spent so many weeks training the dog, wouldn't it be natural and necessary to call the dog by his name?
Whenever I meet someone's dog, the first thing that I ask is, ""What is his name?""

I wondered how the original owner of the dog kept him in a trailer park without the dog killing people constantly.
A german shepherd is a big dog that needs space, he cannot be kept cooped up.
So, the old man would have to walk the dog, on a leash, and keep the dog from killing any black person who is walking down the street.
Obviously, the dog could not be outside without a leash because he is a killer.which makes me wonder how the dog was free to run away.

I wondered why the original owner would create a white dog.
Obviously, he hated black people, and so, he trained the dog to kill them.
But, he had to know that he couldn't just allow the dog to kill as many black people as he sees.
If just a handful of people ended up dead, obviously attacked by a dog, it would not take long for the police to trace the murders to that dog.
Then, the dog would be taken away and killed.
This doesn't make sense.
The owner created a white dog, but he could never actually let the dog kill, which would be his goal.

I wondered how that old man could allow a killer dog to be around his small granddaughters.
Even if he believed that the dog would never hurt the granddaughters, why would he want the granddaughters to ever possibly see the dog kill?
That would be a horrible trauma for a child, to see her cherished dog attack and kill a stranger.

It doesn't make sense why Kristy McNichol's character couldn't figure out that she had an attack dog - - she needed her boyfriend to tell her.
The dog ran off, and he came back to her covered in blood.
She simply said to the dog, ""Did you get into a fight?"" as if it was a cute thing that the dog drew blood, whether it was from a person or another animal.
She was not at all upset that the dog was covered in blood.
She bathed him, washed away the blood, and was almost praising the dog.
How could she not wonder or care about what the dog had done?
Why wouldn't she worry about her own safety - - she saw how angry the dog got around her boyfriend - - and she didn't care about her boyfriend's safety either.
And yet, as soon as she heard that the dog killed a man, she was shocked, and she suddenly wanted the dog killed.
It was surprising when she changed her mind and wanted to get the dog help instead of having him killed.

After the dog attacked the black actress, Kristy McNichol was allowed to just go home with her dog.
Didn't anyone try to take the dog away or tell her to get rid of him, warning her that the dog was dangerous?
There are fines if you don't clean up your dog's poop.so, how can it be okay for a dog to attack?
Wouldn't Kristy McNichol get a fine, at least?
Wouldn't the police take the dog away, and even have the dog killed?
Why would Kristy McNichol even want to take the dog home after seeing him attack - - why wasn't she suddenly afraid for her own safety - - why wasn't she afraid that he could attack again, at any moment, after seeing him attack so suddenly?
I was surprised that the black actress didn't press charges of some kind, and I was also surprised that it didn't bother her that Kristy McNichol still had that dog at home with her.

I wondered how much money those five weeks of training were costing Kristy McNichol's character.
She didn't seem too happy about paying the vet bill at the beginning of the movie, so why did she suddenly not mind the trainer's fees?
She was an out-of-work actress, living alone in a huge house, and she dressed really nicely and had a nice car, and I wondered how she afforded it all.

I wondered why the characters of Burl Ives and the black trainer would train the dog.
They both clearly said that they didn't think it was possible.
Even at the end, the 99% was not enough to convince the trainer because he didn't really believe that it the dog could be changed.
So, if the movie had ended differently (with the dog appearing to be changed), it still would have been irresponsible of them to let Kristy McNichol go home with the dog, knowing that he may always be dangerous.
Burl Ives told the story of his friend who had been killed by his beloved dog who suddenly turned on him, so he knew better.

So, at the end, the dog obviously went insane.
He learned not to attack black people, so instead, he figured that he should attack white people next.
Kristy McNichol's character was lucky that the dog remembered how good she had been to him, so he didn't attack her.

And the dog's original owner got away with what he did.

The ending was very sad.",1454198400,2,5324,4.205882352941177

1563424,5,B00005JPID,"I watch this movie because someone back in the 1980's did not believe an American like myself could grasp the subject matter, be objective and continue to buy movie tickets. While I soaked in 1982 view of racist white dog from my 2015 perspective, I must say I really enjoyed the performance from each of the individual actors. Sam Fuller, as a director of talented animals and actors --You Rule!

Now, Sam, am I being sold on the idea that the only cure for racist white dogs is a bullet? My grandfather was an admitted racist. I was fortunate to be raised by a Mom and a Dad who did not see a color bar. Your movie has made me think about all of these variables from my own childhood  --and I am still decompressing. This is the element makes White Dog such a great movie.

I have read a lot about this movie. Heard it was even based on a true story. The truth is, you will be watching a fictionalized account by the writer (Roman Gary) and his own wife's experience with a stray Alabama police dog trained to attack black people on site. Welcome to the 1960's.

My God.

Having seen this for myself, I now believe the opinions came from people that have never actually enjoyed the whole movie from their own comfortable perspective.

It's ""ok"" and I made it through only because I am stubborn.

1563511,5,B00005JPID,"The last American film of Samuel Fuller, White Dog, stands as an analogy of the American culture in what, since the election of President Obama, has been deemed as a post-racial world. And while one would argue the election of a black president is a turning point in our country's and cultures history, the racial hatred that has risen exponentially since President Obama's election - a good portion of it directed at him - would suggest that our culture has a long, long, long, way to go before we can even hint at it being a post-racial world.

That said, White Dog, based on a true story, is one film in a long line of Fuller's work throughout his career that have dealt with the issues of racism. The title dog is a white German Shepherd that is accidentally struck while on a dark road by a car driven by a young actress played by Krtisty McNichol (Eight is Enough). She takes the dog to a local vet then brings it home to heal while she posts signs in the neighborhood looking for its owner. The next night, an intruder, a white man, breaks into McNichols home and the dog rushes to her rescue, dramatically breaking through a glass window in slow motion - when it actually meant something back then - to subdue the perp, holding him until the police arrive. After the incident, the dog and McNichol lovingly bond and she brings the dog to the studio for an acting gig she has. While the dog rests peacefully on the studio floor, McNichol's acting partner, a young black woman, begins to speak her lines which wakes the dog from its slumber. The dog jumps up and viciously attacks the black actress. McNichol soon discovers that this dog is a white dog, a dog purposely trained to attack black people. Enter Paul Winfield, a black man who is an animal trainer for films. McNichol brings the dog to him in the hopes he can reprogram it - himself determined by the challenge to the break the dog of its racial attacks. In the meantime the dog escapes its steel kennel and kills an elderly black man in a church. But still Winfield wants to wipe the programmed hate out of the dog this time by making himself the bait. While he succeeds in one aspect the dogs rage is refocused but it turns on another character forcing Winfield to shoot the dog dead.

Fullers subject matter has always been somewhat controversial; and so much so for White Dog, which came out in 1982, that the NAACP at the time thought this film incited racism, which is exactly the opposite of what Fuller was aiming for. According to wikipedia, Fuller was a staunch integrationist for his hiring of black actors for non-stereotypical roles. After a limited release the film was shelved by Paramount until 2008 when the Criterion Collection released it on DVD. While somewhat dated in its look, the script by Fuller and Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential), raises legitimate questions on the subject of racism in our county. There is no doubt that race relations have come a long way but have the seeds of racial equality been planted deep enough to grow through a foundation of renewed hate of people of color in our society today? In light of the recent and unprecedented amount of white police officers shooting black people I would say not. And for these police officers, like the dog in the film, the question remains, is racism a curable learned behavior or mental illness that is treatable, or are we hardwired to be racist and maybe there is no cure?",1429488000,3,3427,4.561688311688312

1563580,4,B00005JPID,"White Dog (Samuel Fuller, 1982)

There a number of directors who have become canonical over the years whose films I have simply never gotten. Woody Allen. Mario Bava. Sam Fuller. Every time I dig into a Fuller movie I try and see what it is that sets him apart, and every time I fail. My most recent attempt was with the 1982 racism melodrama White Dog, and I think that perhaps I've figured out what the canon sees in him. I still didn't get to the all that and a bag of racists point with this one, but it's starting to make sense. The thing about Sam Fuller's strain of melodrama, if I'm right in my hypothesizing, is that in movies like Shock Corridor and Pickup on South Street, both of which left me kind of cold, Fuller was doing that gig first; Douglas Sirk and Grace Metalious and Russ Meyer and all that lot would come after and hone the genre, so that when Fuller returned to the fold in the eighties, he not only had his own base to work from, he had everyone else's, too. And I think that, more than anything, may be what impressed me about White Dog: Fuller wasn't afraid to build on the work of others, rather than focusing obsessively upon his own corpus.

Plot: Julie Sawyer (Little Darlings' Kristy McNichol) finds what she believes to be a stray dog. Very attractive beast, if a little scraggly, so she takes him home, shows him a little TLC, and everything seems greatuntil all the sudden he attacks someone out of nowhere while she's walking him. Eventually, a pattern of behavior is established, and she comes to realize that he's not called a white dog because of the color of his coatthis is a dog who has been trained to attack black people. Believing that this behavior can be unlearned, she enlists the help of Hollywood animal trainer Keys (Terminator's late, great Paul Winfield) in retraining him. Keys, upon finding out (firsthand) the dog's conditioning, is reluctant to accept the job, but eventually becomes as obsessed as Julie with the idea that racism can be cured.

These days, in hindsight, when we think of Kristy McNichol, we think about her memoir and the horrible things that happened to her and, tangentially at best, Empty Nest. She didn't make a huge number of features over the course of her career, and Two Moon Junction was a horrible choice for everyone involved, but if you go back farther than that, McNichol was very good at what she did. Pair her with a guy like Winfield, who could take a dead guy on a table and give a compelling performance, and you've got some bones to hang a movie on. A maudlin movie to be sure, nakedly manipulative and full of the kinds of characters who have all the depth of a Phoenix snowstorm, but every once in a while there are good guys, there are bad guys, and we're not supposed to disagree. Fuller's got himself a ready-made villainI mean, who trains a dog to attack black people?and from there, your hero being a black dog trainer is obvious. That their characters have all the shade of a Joshua tree is kind of irrelevant.

Not a bad little movie at all; my favorite of the Fullers I've seen by a pretty wide margin. Expect something closer to a disease-of-the-week TV movie than Kurosawa and you'll have a grand time with it. *** ",1416528000,,3222,4.500854700854701

1563655,5,B00005JPID,"This is Sam Fuller's disclosed diatribe against public hatred delivered through a metaphorical story about a girl and her dog. There is much to be read into this film, and it's one of my favorites. Several scenes make me tear up. Yes, animal cruelty is grotesque in any case, and this is a case of it being psychological which is, to some, even more disturbing. But if you love cinema, and the movies of S. T. Fuller, then you have to own this Criterion disc. The film offers plenty for discussion and critical analysis. I guess you need to be an animal lover to really get into this one or to understand it fully, but I think it's one of the best ethical discussions for a case for animals ever committed to celluloid, and to me that means something.
The Criterion disc has some great extras, a 55 minute making of piece which is a must see, featuring writer Curtis Hanson. The other great piece is the booklet, which has two fine critical pieces included in it. This is a melancholy, fascinating film, not for every taste perhaps, but it's in my list of the top ten films of all time. The picture and sound on the disc is terrific, and I think Fuller fans will be pleased that this rare--and horribly misinterpreted--film has finally made it onto a high quality DVD.

1563747,4,B00005JPID,"White Dog is not an easy film to sit through and it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way for a simple reason; it hits close to home. Racism did exist back then just like it does now and the film strips the idea of racism down to its simplest, by showing it for what it is; fear. And what clearer way to demonstrate this but centering the film around a dog who was raised to fear and attack black people on sight.

Kristy McNicol has a natural, easy-going screen presence and delivers a solid performance as an actress whose adopted stray turns out to attack people. She is appalled when her loving, good-natured German Shepherd disappears and comes back stained with blood. When she takes him to a trainer to be rehabilitated, she learns that he doesn't attack just anyone, only black people. Since pupphyhood, the dog was habitually beaten and taught to associate black people with being attacked, until he attacks any black person on sight, before they get him. This is racism stripped to its barest; fear, taught to us, handed down by those we learn from. But can a simple creature like this dog be taught to overcome his fear? That's the task that the trainer, played by Paul Winfield, is set with. If he can cure this dog of his racism, then why can't people?

White Dog was controversial on its release, in fact some people insisted on branding it as a racist movie. There is nothing racist about it, except that it exposes the tumour in our society that is racism and what it essentially is. Things like this really have happened, racists trained their dogs to perform these terrible acts. White Dog is clever because the subject of racism isn't beaten over the viewer's head. The dog is the perfect demonstration of this. Here is a creature completely innocent of his terrible crimes, the guilty party being those who trained him. White Dog isn't afraid to take us along for the ride and show us what exactly this fear-ridden dog does, and we know that he only does these things because he's been programmed to do so, showcasing the true, subtle horror of racism. It's a graphic, tough movie that isn't easy to sit through, but it's an important film that should be appreciated, not feared. It's a sad thing that White Dog was so shunned because people branded it as a racist movie, thus showcasing prejudice of their own. What irony.

Even with its low budget, White Dog delivers the punches, and while it doesn't look like a polished film, it somehow works much better because of this. The performances all around are stellar. Outshining all, though, is the main character, the dog himself. It's downright unreal to witness an animal acting like that.

1563752,1,B00005JPID,"Years ago, the ABC (US) Television network broadcast ""the ABC after-school special"". The program consisted of dramas starring TV actors dealing with complex social issues in trivial ways. The production values were usually low and they were the worst sort of message films. Nobody considered them as great works of art.

White Dog is a 1970s-style message film with TV movie quality. It accidentally gained fame by turning out to be one of the last films of Sam Fuller. And it further gained a following through obscurity and not being seen. As usual, the legend grows in the absence of much of anyone having seen the work.

It stars 70's oddity Kristy McNicoll who as usual is a bad actress. The script is terrible, the direction is terrible, the music is terrible and its all heavy-handed paternalistic messages around every corner. And there is just something really wrong with a metaphor that combines dealing with racism in society and dog training. Jameson Parker is another TV actor who puts in a tv movie of the week performance. Paul Winfield manages to turn in a good performance. But the dogs are by far the best actors.

In TV movie terms, there isn't anything especially bad about the film. Its greatest flaw is how ordinary it is.

It was released to a limited theatrical run in 1982 and was never released on tape until 26 years later when it was released on DVD in 2008.

The story is definitely disturbing and much of that was relayed successfully in the film. I thought the quality of the picture was superb! The acting teetered between mediocre and good, however.

I'm sure the film had a much greater impact back in the early eighties when it first came out. Racism was still a raw subject in much of America. The fact it had a limited theatrical release tells me that America was not yet comfortable with the raw message of the film: Once a racist, always a racist.

At the same time, his stories (usually B stories, always with an element of melodrama, and a heavy dose of pulp, and a low-budget vibe) always also manage to be unique and engaging.  This film is no exception.

It is a film about Julie, a young, aspiring actress who adopts a dog and finds out it is no ordinary dog.  It is a ""white dog"" trained from a young age to fear and attack people with black skin.  Julie, convinced that the dog is not at fault for its training, finds an animal trainer willing to attempt a rehabilitation.  What Fuller achieves by making the dog both Julie's protector and the perpetrator of violence is to generate both sympathy for the animal and anger at its behavior.  Fuller's message, in a nutshell, may be to hate (and fight against) racism without at the same time hating the racist.  While the dog's training is an obvious metaphor for racism - that aims to show its stupidity and insidiousness, it also, more subtly, makes clear that those who grow up racist inherit their prejudices unthinkingly and should therefore also be considered victims.

Sam Fuller's astonishing technique is to take a very blunt premise and weave it into a story that (however hokey it might seem if merely described) manages to be gripping, and somehow even plausible.  Every character offers something unique and memorable, and I found myself thoroughly drawn in by the story.  The dialogue works on multiple levels, with several conversations serving as both blunt and powerful lectures to the audience on the evil and stupidity of racism, and plausible conversations between characters that flow out of actual situations.  Few directors could pull this off without it seeming hokey and heavyhanded.  Sam Fuller manages.

This film was made for Paramount Studios in 1984, but they never gave it a theatrical release.  The plot, about a stray dog taken in by Kristy MacNichol that is a ""white dog"", a dog trained to kill and maim black people, was considered too hot for them, and the film ended up being a legendary, unseen work.  It ended up being the final film of the great Sam Fuller (who directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Curtis Hanson, the director of L.A. Confidential).  Is the film great, or is it a disappointment?  Well...

The film is mixed.  When it works, it's very, very good, and when it doesn't, it's slightly embarrassing (which may have been another reason why Paramount didn't release it in the States).  It's never cringe inducing or creaky, but there are notable flaws here.  There is bad dialogue (some of which sounds dubbed in, and it's bad dubbing), overacting, some bad camera moves, sledgehammer music cues (especially during an early attack scene), and boring, arbitary secondary characters (Kristy MacNichol's boyfriend and a policeman, for example).  The first third of the film is a bit dull.  But when Paul Winfield enters the film (he's the trainer that attempts to cure the white dog of its racism), the film is much better.  Winfield is great here, playing an entirely believable, passionate person who really wants to cure the dog of its hatred of black people.  There are some powerful moments, like when Kristy goes to the pound to look for her dog.  We see in long shot a dog placed in a chamber that puts him to sleep.  We don't see the dog pass away (Fuller isn't exploitative), but he shows a close up of the chamber, which is powerful and sad.  After that, Kristy becomes determined to cure her dog.

Fuller comes up with some excellent camera work (especially in the cage where the animal is retrained), great performances by the dog (there were five dogs portraying the white dog in the film), some funny humour directed at R2D2 (yes, the Star Wars robot), and a very powerful and memorable ending.  Overall, it's a mixed bag, but its positives outweight its negatives.  If you like Fuller, you should check this out.  It's not perfect, but it's a memorable film.

You white folk better be careful with your tan.  This dog sees dark skin, it attacks with a bitter hatred.
Instead of putting the beast to sleep, the new owner takes it to a specialized trainer, to see if this animosity can be unlearned.  Of course, reversing a mindset is no easy task.

This is a powerful story, a bit heavy-handed no doubt, but necessary.  The acting in this movie is sub-par, except from the dog.  The way the animal explodes with uncontrollable rage is alarming, not to mention all too convincing.  A powerful tale.

The premise of the movie, the central metaphor, has a lot of potential, but the director/writer failed to take advantage of it. When you take on a subject as controversial as racism, you should do it justice by delving into the material, showing how racism works in the lives of the characters. Instead, the characters in this film all express sanitized, politically correct points of view--they are all untouched by the reality of racism.

1563821,3,B00005JPID,"In 1982, Samuel Fuller's ""WHITE DOG"" created a storm of controversy that resulted in a limited theatrical release with no follow-up video until now.

What was falsely labeled an incendiary racist film that could provoke real life violence is instead a bold anti-racist parable about how racism is learned or taught. In the movie the metaphor is a dog that has been trained to attack people with dark skin.

The origin of the story is a harrowing true incident Romain Gary wrote about in Life magazine.

The movie story is simple.  Julie Sawyer (Kristy McNichol in her first adult role) is a young actress who, while driving one night, accidentally hits a white German shepherd on a mountain road.  She takes it to a vet and tries to find the owner.  In the meantime, Julie grows attached to the dog.  One night it saves her from a intruder who attempts to rape her.  Later, the dog runs away and comes home bloody.  On a movie set with Julie, the dog attacks a black actress.  Julie realizes the dog has been trained as an attack dog so she takes it to ""Noah's Ark"" an animal shelter and training facility hoping the dog can be deprogrammed in some way.  She is told that the dog is a ""white dog,"" one trained to attack black people.  At the facility, Keys (Paul Winfield), a dog expert sees this as an opportunity to see if racial prejudice can be unlearned.

This low-budget film is sometimes heavy-handed but is immensely watchable and the restored uncut widescreen transfer is, as with all Criterion editions, made from the best elements available and is very crisp and clean.

Kristy McNichol has a natural, winning charisma on screen.  Her top billing is justified and she has an easy, believable chemistry with the dog (actually five dogs were used).

Paul Winfield dominates the latter half of the film.  His performance is focused and intense.  I was reminded of a superb dog story in which he starred, 1972's ""Sounder.""

The great Burl Ives has a small part as the co-owner of ""Noah's Ark.""  It is great to hear that singular voice even if it is only in spoken words.

Director Sam Fuller had a reputation as a tough, cigar-chomping sometimes over-the-top, story-teller.  He has been called ""the tabloid poet.""  Fuller did not shy away from controversial issues and in fact helmed other films with racial conflict as a theme.  He died in 1997 at the age of 85.
