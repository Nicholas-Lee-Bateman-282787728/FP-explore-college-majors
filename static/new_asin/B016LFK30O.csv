7474758,5,B016LFK30O,"If you are looking for a suspenseful show with some depth, you may want to sample this show LEGENDS.  It is based upon a novel of the same name by Robert Littel.

The backstory is an agent Martin Odum (Sean Bean) who frequently goes undercover, and adopts a legend about his fake identity, is having trouble remembering his past. When a stranger accosts him, and tells him he isn't who he thinks he is, he begins to wonder if his memory is slipping.

Or, is it just stress from the many undercover jobs he has been assigned to?

Each episode he is involved in a case.  Some cases stretch to more than one episode.  One of the entertaining aspects of the series is that the agent has to assume many false identities from domestic terrorist to arms buyer. It's fun to see Sean Bean change accents and body language.  Dealing with these kinds of cases, the series has a high body count.  Don't get too attached to anyone.

I use series like these to exercise to as you focus on the story, not on how long you've been walking on the treadmill.

This was created by the  producers of HOMELAND.  It is pretty intense and absorbing.  It's quite entertaining as it balances action, sharp dialogue, great technical effects, talented acting, the latest intelligence techniques and some depth of story line.  It's worth watching.",1453075200,2,1318,4.600858369098712

7474761,5,B016LFK30O,"Sean Bean is the entire reason to watch this show. I've always liked him in just about anything but watching him flash in and out of different personalities and accents is incredible. Decent supporting cast, well written and fast paced. Definitely worth watching more than once.",1449878400,7,278,5.065217391304348
7474762,4,B016LFK30O,"What is a ""legend""? It's a false identity that undercover agents can slip on and off, adopting new personas that they may truly live out for months at a time.

And one such agent is the focus of ""Legends Season 1,"" a smart, densely-packed thriller that stars Sean Bean as a man whose very identity -- real and ""legendary"" is in constant flux. Some of the FBI stuff is by-the-numbers (oh look, a handler who thinks he's out of control!), with plenty of terrorists trying to blow up/poison large numbers of people and start wars, but the subplot about Bean's character trying to uncover his past is truly mesmerizing. As, for that matter, is Bean.

Martin Odum (Bean) is the FBI's top covert operative, with a wide array of ""legends"" ranging from charming reporters to socially-awkward racists. But being so good at his job has cost him, since he often spends months away from his ex-wife Sonya (Amber Valletta) and son Aiden (Mason Cook), and he often struggles to return to ""himself"" after spending weeks or months in a legend. His mental state is fragile, but his boss Nelson Gates (Steve Harris) is frequently forced to call on him.

In the midst of infiltrating a right-wing paramilitary group, Odum is confronted by a mysterious stranger, who promptly is stabbed to death. But before he dies, he reveals something: there is no Martin Odum. His ""true"" identity is yet another legend.

Over the course of the season, Martin adopts various legends to investigate two more major threats. Chechen terrorists kidnap a former nerve-gas chemist and force him to produce several liters of VX gas, so Martin has to adopt the guise of an arms dealer and play hardball with the Chechen mob. Then a Saudi prince is blown up in front of several FBI agents, with the blame seemingly lying on a prominent women's activist. But the FBI muckitymucks don't want the actual murderer -- a hardcore Islamic royal who is determined not to let women get any rights -- to be identified, out of fear it will affect oil prices.

And as Martin weaves through these messy situations, he begins to finds the chinks in his own identity -- in his past, his marriage, his job, the people who claim he was once in Iraq, and the mysterious Verax Corporation. The problem is, he can't really remember what happened -- only what he's been told was true. And the people he's tracking may be able to destroy more than his life.

If you've seen government thrillers, then you have a pretty good idea of what ""Legends"" is about -- lots of fast-paced pursuit of evil terrorists who want to kill people for terrorist reasons, with some families held hostage and a good-guy hero who is always on the knife's edge of being too dark and out-of-control. Yeah, it hits a lot of fairly typical notes, but it's handled in a dense, action-packed manner, with lots of blood, guns and computer wizardry.

Additionally, most of the stories stretch over multiple episodes,  rather than having everything tidily solved after forty-five minutes -- it gives more a feeling of harsh realism. And it weaves in the current political clime, especially in the final arc involving Saudi royalty and the fight to give women rights. Not to mention the all-too-realistic approach of the US government to anything embarrassing -- find a scapegoat fast, and follow whatever they decide is the most convenient outcome. Don't rock the boat with actual facts, especially if they make prominent crony corporations look bad.

But the real draw here is not just the action or fast-paced FBI work, but the mystery of Martin Odum. Who is he? Where did he come from? How much of his life is fabricated? What happened in Iraq? How much do the people around him -- including his best friend and his ex-wife -- know about who he truly is? In fact, Martin's dogged pursuit of the truth is the real suspenseful core of the series, especially when he goes off the FBI grid and drags around a wounded enemy in pursuit of answers.

And none of this would work half so well if Sean Bean weren't the lead. Bean is absolutely perfect here -- he can flick on the charm and looks physically powerful enough to best someone in a fight. But he also plays Martin as a fragile man, with haggard features and an oddly hesitant way of speaking, as if he isn't always entirely sure that what he is saying is the truth. It's a beautifully layered performance, and the darker, more violent moments that shine through the legends (he stabs a Chechen mafioso through the hand) make you wonder what is lurking under the surface.

He's also backed by a pretty solid cast -- Harris, Ali Larter and Tina Majorino fill out the FBI cast as Martin's boss, his rather cranky but admiring handler, and a sprightly data manipulator; we also have Morris Chestnut as a doughty FBI agent who initially suspect Martin of something shady, but later joins the team. Valetta is a bit meh as Martin's ex-wife, though -- it often feels like Bean is carrying their scenes singlehanded.

""Legends"" ends with a double punch of gut-wrenching betrayal and some answers about Martin's true identity -- and of course, it leaves you salivating for the second season. If it builds on what has been placed here, that season can only be good news.",1448236800,10,5219,4.691803278688525

7474764,3,B016LFK30O,"I purchased this DVD to revisit the first season of this absorbing story in advance of the Season 2 premiere on the TNT cable network.  ""Legends"" is a superior cable suspense series, and Sean Bean is outstanding in the lead role.  The 10 episodes are gripping, well-written, tightly organized, and superbly acted -- worthy of 5 stars, in my view.  But the DVD itself is at best a 2-star product -- the barest of bare bones. -- offering zero extras, zero accompanying commentary, no chapter guides or links within episodes, and no closed captions or subtitles.  The DVD served its purpose, did not malfunction, and caught me up on the story line.  But it added nothing more.",1446336000,4,673,4.717948717948718
7474765,4,B016LFK30O,"Based on the terrific novel by Robert Littell, and brought to television by the same team that gave us 24 and Homeland, two summers ago, TNT treated us to the show, Legends. The show featured spectacular action, edge of your seat drama, and some of the best writing on television, but it was gone after just twenty episodes. Some viewers had a problem with the casting of Sean Bean, as the lead character, but the real issue was with a network that just couldn't leave well enough alone.

Martin Odum (Sean Bean) is a man who is told that he doesn't exist. Odum the best CIA undercover agent in the game is approached on the street one day, told that there has been an accident, and ever since that day, he has bought his own cover or legend and now believes he is this man Martin Odum, but who is he really? It's a slippery slope for Odum, as he tries to continue doing his job, while at the same time trying to figure out who he is and why he's posing as a CIA agent.

With this series, TNT wasn't only getting a show that was created by arguably one of America's best espionage writers, but they also got the team that single-handedly changed the face of television drama, with nine seasons of the innovative show, 24, and the continuing drama of Homeland. These people know what they're doing, but even after a successful first season, the network wanted more, and decided to drop the current storyline and replace almost the entire cast for season two. Fans were expecting to continue where they left off and instead, were trust into the middle of what amounted to a brand new show. A brand new show that was hardly advertised and was cancelled immediately after the end of season 2.

Sean Bean stars and while he fits the character of Odum, as a forty-something British guy, fans of Bean know that he always plays the bad guy, most notable in the film, National Treasure. Seeing Bean as one of the good guys does take an adjustment, but a lot of time he's undercover as one of the bad guys, so it's really not as strange as his fans make it out to be.

...and what was the purpose for replacing the original cast? It's not as if they were all inexperienced newcomers. Ali Larter is beautiful and a network veteran of shows like Heroes, Steve Harris has seemingly been in everything, and Morris Chesnutt was a revelation on the re-launch of the show V a few years back.

Legends had all the makings of a terrific show, with outstanding writers, directors, producers, and an experienced cast, but the network it was on wanted huge ratings from the show and when they didn't happen immediately, TNT threw in the towel. I enjoyed the undercover angles, the humor, the action, and of course the drama, of Legends, and Sean Bean in particular gives some of the best performances of his career, but it was all for not as the plug was pulled before things even got started. If you want to know the real truth behind Martin Odum, you're just going to have to suck it up and read the book.",1470009600,,2985,4.439781021897811

8736710,3,B016LFK30O,This series left my family and I cold. It seemed like a vehicle to pump up Sean Bean.

8736711,5,B016LFK30O,"A great series to dive into...  While I have only watched 7 episodes, the Pros are: excellent actors, great action, a storyline that moves each episode along nicely and the camera does love Sean Bean. An underlying mystery that threads each episode is a bit intriguing, however it isn't an edge-of-your-seat unfolding. Which brings me to the Cons:  the possibility of a Bourne-esque subterfuge has already been done, makeup is a bit overdone (where did they get that rug on SB in the beginning episodes??) and on balance, it could stand to be less predictable. Having said all that, it's FIVE stars because the pros outweigh the cons and because there are few series out there with as much going for it.  Bravo!",1484352000,,711,4.764227642276423
