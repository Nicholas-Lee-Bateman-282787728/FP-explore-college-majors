2660604,5,B000ION2IU,A wonderful telling of the story of a man who gave his life to God and for the firefighters who he served and loved.,1220140800,,116,3.875
2660605,5,B000ION2IU,The Saint of 911 is a testament to the courage and spiritual insight of Mychal Judge.  His story could teach many in the Catholic Church about faith and tolerance.  Five stars!,1207612800,,176,4.645161290322581
2660606,5,B000ION2IU,"This story slowly reveals the portrait of a man, dedicated to serving God and his fellows. It reveals layers upon layers of humanity. Michael Judge, the ""hero"" of this story, is an everyman and yet stands apart as a saint. It's a movie that brings tears of joy for  how amazing human beings can be, even in the midst of tears for how wordlessly destructive we can be, too.

This is a wonderful story of spiritual humanism - or human spirituality. Michael Judge took Jesus admonition seriously, that ""as much as ye have done it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.""",1204848000,5,590,4.453703703703703
2660607,5,B000ION2IU,"Everyone should see this movie!  Not only is it the best documentary I have ever seem about 9/11, it tells a story of a true american hero.  Many Catholics and religious conservatives will be scandalized by what they learn about this man.  It really challenges the viewer to redefine what they think they know about loving and serving God.  I always knew I loved this man.  After watching this, I understood even more how much we lost that day, and how brave this man truly was.",1199664000,,478,4.511627906976744
2660608,5,B000ION2IU,"If you have ever read anything about Father Mike you will love this video. It truly shows what he was all about: charity, humanity, love, and faith. I do feel, however, that most of it was just telling about his sexuality. That's not who he was. He was those words that typed about above! It never told the story about how he talked down a suicidal maniac that had taken his family hostage in New Jersey. It never went into great depth about what kind love he had for the firefighters of NYC. But I would recommend this movie and I love owning it, since after renting it, I just had to have my own copy. Rent it, buy it, borrow it from a friend and you will truly enjoy this man and video.",1199404800,,689,4.149253731343284
2660609,5,B000ION2IU,"This is a wonderful dvd. I'm sure he'd be proud that his life has been an inspiration to so many. His compassion for the forgotten in our society was awe inspiring. I wish I had known him. He made the love of all God's children easy to understand. Human sexuality is a spectrum and God loves us all because he made us all. He made it wasy to understand why we are not to judge, that is left up to God. How wonderful it would be for him to be called a Saint by our troubled Church, but his is truely a saint with a small s that we are all called to be !",1181692800,,552,3.8086956521739133
2660610,5,B000ION2IU,What a great tribute to Father Mychal and the Franciscans: men living what they preach.  I must see for all truly spiritual people.,1173398400,2,131,4.695652173913044
2660611,5,B000ION2IU,"The power of Father Mychal Judge's impact on those who knew him and those, like me, who only met him through this documentary, is his honesty, his ability to accept life as is, and his thoroughly non-judgemental way of interacted with others.

I did not experience this work as a work about a gay man or gay priest or an alcoholic man or an alcoholic priest who showed courage on 9/11. Instead, I experienced this work as being about a man who dealt with alcoholism and who happened to be gay. Each truth is but a component of the man, neither one is his definition. The defining truth about Father Mychal Judge is found in his courage, honesty, capacity for acceptance, his non-judgement of others and his unflinching loyalty to the firefighters. A loyalty that is underscored when one learns that Mayor Guiliani told Father Mychal, who was at the WTC with the firefighters, he could join the mayor's party and go to a safe place. Father Mychal said, ""No, I've got to stay with my men.""

Father Mychal was administering to a dying firefighter when he was killed in the collapse of the first tower. Father Mychal Judge understood that, as I have heard in the rooms of AA, ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking less about yourself."" I think everyone should see this documentary. Perhaps Father Mychal Judge knew there is no safer place than heaven.",1161302400,34,1368,4.648760330578512
2660612,3,B000ION2IU,"Father Judge died on 9-11 being of assistance to his beloved firefighters.  This work explores his life through people who knew him best.

If you loved Mother Theresa, you should love this guy.  He helped the homeless.  He had ethnic pride.  A black man was interviewed who spoke of how Judge befriended and aided him; I get the sense the Father was an anti-racism advocate.

He was human like everyone else, just with a big heart.  He admitted to struggling with alcoholism.  He got a shamrock tattoo ""somewhere private"" without realizing it.  He was not out everywhere, so the closet was a challenge for him, like many gay men.

Many bigots say that gay men can't be patriotic and are immoral.  Here was a man full of ethics.  He died helping those in need.  He should be respected by people of all sexualities.

I read a review elsewhere that said he couldn't be gay because he was a priest.  However, in this work, the people who knew him said he identified as gay.  Deal with it if you can't!  If I remember correctly, they do not say whether he was always celibate.  They could have been braver by truthfully addressing that issue.

Ian McKellen follows Harvey Fierstein in being an openly gay man narrating a documentary about another openly gay man.  His voice has the resonance and authority that one would expect for such an accomplished actor.

At times gushy, this piece was still a powerful one that every American should enjoy and from which every American should learn.",1161043200,21,1484,4.652509652509653

2660687,5,B000ION2IU,"Having known him personally as a firefighter from Ky I must say he truly was a saint on this earth. Watching the video the British Filmmakers made I can honestly say I never in all my time with him ever saw a look like the one on his face in the North Tower at the command post. He definitely was praying and I almost certain that he knew the end of this life and many many others was fast approaching.

I am inspired with his faith, his practice of it, the authenticity of his search for how to be able to minister to those dying of AIDS and how he was able to achieve this.  I am inspired by the authenticity also of how he lived his Franciscan values, little things - like giving away his sweater to someone on the street, and his friends knowing this is what he did.

2660732,5,B000ION2IU,"I knew Father Mychal very well, he was a dear freind of mine.  I went to St. Joseph's  Church when he was a priest there and spent a lot of time with him.  Actually, I became a Catholic as I spent a year going to classes every Monday night to know about the religion, and after that time, I decided to convert.  He married me, came to our home and blessed it and also blessed our car.
  It was very touching to watch the DVD and seeing him again.  His story was wonderful and I will treasure it as a favorite in my collection.
Thank you so much for this fabulous documentary.

2660735,5,B000ION2IU,"A very well done depiction of a man who, although flawed, was truly a saint.  Mychal Judge was the first to die on Sept. 11, 2001.  He died as he lived, taking care of others.  This is a documentary that tells of the life of Fr. Mychal Judge and the stories of those whose lives he touched and in many cases, the lives he transformed.

2660737,5,B000ION2IU,"I've been working at Siena College since 2009 and kept hearing about Fr. Mychal Judge--his name is on the memorial of 9/11 victims related to Siena--but had no idea what an amazing life he led until seeing this documentary. He truly understood the need for someone to share his weakness and strength with those he served--not only the fire and police department heroes, but also society's castoffs. Fr. Mychal was a fine example of a man who walked in the footsteps of Christ.",1380499200,,476,4.746987951807229
2660738,5,B000ION2IU,"This was a very touching story, or biography, about a very selfless man.  It wasn't really about 9/11 except for the fact of how he died.
I remember in one of the 9/11 specials on tv they , the firefighters, talked about him and how beloved a person he was.
I think that this was a tribute to someone who put everyone else's needs way before his own.  A true man of God.
I would recommend this for anyone who wants to be uplifted by the way someone gave to others with no strings or conditions attached, that it shows that there are some really good people around.",1379808000,,564,4.212962962962963
2660739,5,B000ION2IU,"I knew Mychal, excuse me if I call him that. I met him when he had the Parish at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Germantown Road, in West Milford NJ in the spring of 1979. I myself a recovering alcoholic who stayed away from church for over 20 years. I got up one beautiful Sunday spring morning, in the program of AA about 2 years and just becoming to believe in a Higher Power, which I chose to call God. As I was getting dressed, that still small voice inside said ""go to church"", I laughed and said yea I'm going to church once this afternoon and once tonight, some AA meetings are in church basements. Once again the voice said ""go to church"", I thought to myself ""yea I can go to church, I made my peace with God, haven't been there in a lot of years, hope the roof don't cave in"". I went but got there late, sat in the back pews all alone, this young priest was talking about alcoholism and drug addiction. After the service I wanted to talk to him, I was last on line outside the church, shook his hand and told him my name and thanked him for the service, I then asked if he was a friend of Bill W. He lit up like a Christmas Tree, I couldn't help looking in his eyes, what a smile and his eyes, well he held my hand tight and said ""are you an alcoholic Jim"", I answered yes Father I am, he asked if I went to meetings and I said yes father every day he then asked if would take him to a meeting, I said of course and we agreed to pick him up at the rectory. As I walked away he said ""Jim, Jim my name is Mychal"". I must admit I stayed away from members of the cloth at AA meetings, I didn't need them telling me I was going to hell for my sins, I knew that already, I didn't need to be told that again by a priest. I picked Mychal up the next evening he was waiting for me dressed in a white tee shirt, jeans and sneakers. As he got in the car he said ""now Jim I don't want to hear your confession, talk about church, could we talk about sports, or cooking, or AA"". I knew then I found a friend, a real friend. I became Mychal's sponsor, he became my sprititual advisor, never pushy was Mychal. But I often wonder who sponsored who, my home group of AA was bewildered of me sponsoring a priest, the likes of me and Mychal were most defintely an odd couple, it just didn't fit. Mychal took me under his wing and helped me so much so many times in my search for God, just by being and showing me his love, his unconditional love, didn't matter what I told him, didn't matter what he told me about himself. Sometimes I would be troubled and go to St Joseph's church and go up to the communion rail during the week day afternoon hours and pray and sometimes the side door of the church would open and Mychal came in and knelt down beside and prayed with me. In time we helped each other and we became friends. Sometimes all these years later when I visit NJ, I go to that little church where I met Mychal, I go up to that communion rail to pray, prayers of gratitude to God, Jesus Christ, Mychal taught me to love all people, if I must hate, hate the things they do, to love everything that I do in my life and God put's people in our lives for reasons, the results are God's work. If I'm quiet now when I go there to pray, with no one else around, I feel Mychal kneeling with me in prayer, his spirit lives on, and in the hearts of many that knew him. I often remember that when I was an EMT first aider, I did that for 25 years in sobriety and I am sober now 36 years and still attend AA meetings, who wouldn't if you were in my shoes still attend meetings. For it was there and because of those early years of AA that I met Mychal, it's my gratitude to God for all the fine people I met along the way. I know I will see Mychal again some day.

From watching this great DVD, it brings back Mychal's memory like it was yesterday.",1375056000,,3833,4.003916449086162

2660741,5,B000ION2IU,I'd never really knew who Fr. Mychal was in life but after his passing as the first victim of 9/11 I became more familiar with his story.

2660742,4,B000ION2IU,Fr. Judge was a lot more than he seemed. A true follower of St Francis. He showed love and compassion to all.  The fact he died trying to protect another shows his love.,1371168000,,169,4.121212121212121

2660764,5,B000ION2IU,This brought into light the sacrifices that were made on 9/11. Not just emergency services but the normal everyday people as well. Fr. Mychal went above and beyond what a priest should do and yet did what God called him to do and be...a saint. It's sad to say that in the Boston Marathon bombings priests were not allowed to enter to administer last rights to the victims. To Catholics priests are the ones who bring us from death to life.,1367020800,,439,4.432098765432099

2660766,5,B000ION2IU,"This is truly a story of inspiration. I am not a very religious person yet the life that Father Mychal lead makes me want to be a better person. To have always grown up thinking I could either be a catholic or gay, but not both. The way Father Mychal lead his life but did not let being a man of the cloth or sexual orientation define who he completely was.  Unfortunately I will never get to meet him but through his story I want to be a better person, no matter how corny that sounds. This documentary is not all about, the church, being gay, or 9/11.

Mychal is remembered as not only the selfless but conflicted individual he was in real life, but in the impact upon society on the event of his death on 9/11.  His life was ended upon his being crushed by another victim who had jumped from the tower.  And as a gay man, a priest, he was counted as the first of the 3000+ lives who also perished in the tragedy.  As much as his death was tragic, his memory should be celebrated.",1318377600,,452,4.172413793103448

2660771,5,B000ION2IU,"In spite of his humility, humanity and martyrdom, Fr. Mychal Judge, ""The Saint of 9/11,"" is unlikely ever to grace the stained glass of any Catholic Church. A gay man who fought with Cardinals is a hard sell for the advancement-minded prelates in their ivory rectories. This, even though Mychal presided over firefighter's funerals and browbeat high-end boutiques into coughing up jackets for New York's poor. The film combines interviews with friends and colleagues with footage of Mychal in his white fire chaplain's helmet in the North Tower of the World Trade Center just before its collapse. The film discussed Mychal's love for AIDS victims. Early in the HIV crisis, when even health care workers turned their backs on victims for fear of catching their devastating disease, Mychal burst into their hospital rooms  bearing love, embraces and even kisses for the afflicted. Yet he came to the attention of most of us by his tragic death on 9/11. The images of him pacing the lobby of the tower, looking fearful and worried, coming just moments before the end of his earthly life, were moving and sad. But it was less his final moments than the decades of loving service beforehand that made his death so significant and so painful for so many.

""Saint of 9/11"" provides glimpses of Mychal's struggle with the consequences of his homosexuality and alcoholism, but only slivers of light on the battles with the Church hierarchy. The snippets of tape from a Mass he celebrated with firefighters the day before 9/11 show a priest of ordinary homiletic prowess. But it was the power his deeds that far outshone the rather ordinary theology he preached from the pulpit. His desire to share the lives of his men, even as planes were crashing and bodies falling, was what set him apart from his brother priests, and from the rest of us as well. Requiem in pace, Mychal, you have been a good and faithful servant.",1287014400,9,1909,4.834862385321101
2660772,5,B000ION2IU,"Saint of 9/11 is a touching remembrance of Fr. Mychal Judge, the first recorded fatality of the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center. Through interviews of people whose lives he's touched and archival video, a multi-layered tapestry is unveiled, revealing the rich life of the openly gay Fransciscan friar and beloved fire chaplain for the FDNY. He was an inspiration to many. You would pal around with him, before consciously remembering that he was a man of the cloth.

Fr. Mychal is universally seen as a 'living saint' and Brooklyn's favorite son: a protector of the city's disenfranchised and spiritual guide for the average Joe.

Through a series of anecdotes that director Glenn Holsten smoothly gels into one another, you get to know about the Franciscan priest with 'the wild laugh' whose passion was to simply serve others.

While Fr. Mychal was a superhuman dynamo, he was admittedly not perfect. And yet, you get the impression that he's looked into his soul, judged himself accordingly and moved onward with his life.

While Saint is not an overtly gay film, Fr. Mychal's sexuality cannot be ignored in this review. His sexuality was a part of the priest's personhood. What makes Holsten's direction so powerful is that he doesn't ignore the topic nor treat it with heavy-handed diatribe.

In the end, viewers are left in awe, wishing that they've known a ""Fr. Mychal"" in their lives. At the same time, they are left open to the audacious possiblity that they could be a ""Fr. Mychal""!
