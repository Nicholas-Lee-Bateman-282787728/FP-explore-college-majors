4409664,1,B004LWZW7Y,This movie was such a great disappointment. Boring and pointless. Stupid story line with lots of double crosses. Save your money.,1321142400,13,129,5.190476190476191
4409665,4,B004LWZW7Y,"I haven't kept up with the Shrek series, I think I've only seen the first actually.  So knowing that this is a side story to that, I can't really comment on if it ties in with the series at all.  This is supposedly more of a life before Shrek for Puss in Boots and the adventures that he had.

Puss as a cute young kitten is adopted by a kindly mother in charge of an orphanage.  There he meets Humpty Dumpty, although they later have a falling out in which Puss loses his honor.  But fate has something different in store for him, and when he reunites with Humpty later (and a pretty female feline named Kitty) they go on an adventure that will get the golden goose that lays the golden eggs from the top of the beanstalk.  But there are several people out to stop them, including the infamous duo of Jack and Jill.  Humpty says it will restore Puss's honor though, so he will do all it takes to get the golden goose.

Characters:
Antonio Banderas: Puss in Boots
Salma Hayek: Kitty Softpaws
Zach Galifianakis: Humpty Dumpty
Billy Bob Thornton & Amy Sedaris: Jack and Jill
Walt Dohrn: Narrator

I have to say, I thought Antonio did a great job as Puss.  The accent was very charming on him and even the little hisses and mews made were very cute.  Salma as Kitty was also a nice character although I wish she would have been more in the forefront rather than a sidekick.  Humpty Dumpty, he just freaked me out to be quite honest.  He was kind of creepy looking and a bit smarmy.  But Galifianakis did a good job on the voicing and it fit the character very well.  All the other characters were ok.  I did like Jack and Jill and the banter they had going on between them.  I think they were probably the funniest out of all of them.

For a plot, I actually found a lot of this movie slow going and kind of boring.  Puss would go into a story and I could feel my eyes glaze over since he took so long to tell it.  There was a lot of humour shot in though and I could find myself giggling quite a bit.  Although parents should be warned that some of the jokes are kind of adult in theme.  Luckily as well the ending picked up a bit and made the movie better.  I think the main draw of this movie is probably the animation.  Lots of colors and layers, I didn't see it in 3D but all the same it was still very easy to watch and exciting visually.  The music was also very well fit to the movie.  I liked the different beats that they used and how it was good dancing music.

Not the best movie out of the Shrek series but it had a certain charm.  This is a movie good for all ages.

4409666,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Puss in Boots is one of my very favorite movies ever. It is so sweet, with the most lovable hero ever. When I first saw Shrek, I loved Puss and wished for more of him. I definetly got my wish! I also loved Kitty Softpaws and the ""Oooooo"" kitty. Humpty Dumpty and Jack and Jill and the duck made it weird and Humpty annoyed me, but I still loved it. Great for all ages. I am an 11 year old girl and I really enjoyed this. So cute.",1320364800,27,429,3.8863636363636362
4409667,2,B004LWZW7Y,"Ok, Puss in Boots is definitely cute. He is very lovable and such a sweet little bandit/hero. The movie is similar to other animated ones: funny, cute, adventurous... although not half as funny as the Shrek movies, in my opinion.

But I probably wouldn't even be writing a review if it wasn't for the BIG, HUGE... should I call it MISTAKE (?) of the way Spain is pictured. They mention they are in Spain so there is no confusion here: it IS Spain... although absolutely NOTHING Spanish is anywhere to be seen. The characters all talk with a mix of american and mexican accents (except Antonio Banderas, obviously) and the towns/clothing/scenery is all DESERT!!! Hello?!? Has anyone ever been to Spain?!? Where are all those extended deserts and dusty towns? I am from Spain and I have NEVER seen them. This is very offensive to ANYONE from Spain, and although it's definitely not the first time it happens (especially in movies with Antonio Banderas who obviously doesn't fully understand where he is from)... I didn't expect this in a NEW animated movie of this caliber. This is a mistake many movies and books make... but nonetheless a very serious one.

I don't regret having gone to see the movie, though. My young kids didn't seem offended and enjoyed it, and I guess that's what counts.",1320192000,15,1292,4.737777777777778
4409668,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I must say that ""Puss In Boots"" is a very creative and dynamic movie that is suitable for all ages.  Antonio Banderas brilliantly plays the role of the cat ""Puss In Boots"" who is back to engage in a journey to reclaim his honor.  Salma Hayek also does a clever performance as ""Kitty Softpaws"". Kitty Softpaws  ends up accompanying Puss in Boots in his quest to restore his reputation, and capture magic beans.  Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover movie) plays the role of Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty is a past friend of Puss in Boots and greatly shapes his character evolution through subtle psychological tests.  Billy Bob Thornton (of the Bad Santa movie) and Amy Sedaris play the ""outlaws"" Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill have the magic beans that Puss in Boots wants to covet.  My only caveat with this film is that Jack and Jill were intentionally made to be overweight, plain-looking, and evil.  This reinforces the stereotype that only attractive people are capable of humanity and compassion.  It is common knowledge that there are beautiful people that are both cold and calculating. I would have liked to see villain characters that reflected ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" rather than the usual generic stereotype of only plain people being abrasive.  Aside from this, ""Puss in Boots"" is an engaging animation movie.  I would highly recommend this film for anyone that enjoyed any of the Shrek films.",1320019200,14,1407,4.894514767932489
4409669,4,B004LWZW7Y,"An infamous cat befriends a female, and meets up with an old friend, an egg, sort a Humpty Dumpty. Together, they try to steal a goose who lays golden eggs, for reasons of enrichment, revenge or redemption. The Puss in Boots character is funny and very likeable. This is standard animated fare, but the animation is excellent, and the film is clever, funny and will be fun for the whole family to watch. This one does not rank with the terrific animated movies of recent years, but is certainly one that you should take the kids to see, as everyone will enjoy it.",1319932800,45,563,4.475728155339806
4409670,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Puss in Boots is an animated movie that makes me believe that a pussy cat and an egg can be best friends. Antonio Banderas provides the voice of Puss. Zach Galifianakis is the voice of Humpty Dumpty. They are two characters who grew up together in the film. Their bond of friendship is fun to watch develop in the movie. The story of Puss in Boots is actually based on a French fairy tale about a cat with a talent for stealing things.  The plot of the movie centers around Puss and Humpty searching for magic beans.  These magic beans grow into a bean stalk that leads to a giant's castle.  Inside the castle is a goose that lays golden eggs.  Nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill are the villains in the film. Only the movie makers of Dream Works can breathe life and personality into these two characters.  I love the creative license of the animators.  There are two things about the movie that make it special.  The animation and music are excellent. My favorite scene has Puss sword  fighting and dancing with a female cat named Kitty Soft Paws.  She is voiced by Selma Hayek.  This scene in the movie is very funny.  I love the simple scenes of the movie.  One scene has Puss riding a horse in the back drop of a setting sun.  The film is scored by composer Henry Jackman.  His music gives the movie a sensual latin flair. There is a track of music in the film entitled ""The Puss Suite"".  This piece of music sounds so uplifting and heroic.  Rodrigo Y Gabriela are two latin guitar musicians.  They perform a track entitled ""Diablo Rojo"" in the film.  This instrumental  is upbeat and beautiful to listen to. Puss In Boots is a very entertaining animated film.  I like every aspect of it.",1319932800,27,1697,4.43042071197411
4409801,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I use this movie to teach literary terms to high school students. Although the movie was created for smaller kids, high school students still love it. The plot is well crafted, as it uses complicated literary elements with expert ease. I have had to watch the movie hundreds of times with different students over the years and yet I still do not find it annoying. The actors are big names and understand how to project through the animation.",1523750400,,441,4.666666666666667

4409805,3,B004LWZW7Y,The movie is just as enjoyable as I remember it being when it first came out. I purchased this disc set for my grandson who has recently discovered this new movie because the description says it comes with 2 discs plus digital download. The download license expired in February of 2013. This was a major disappointment. Amazon was quick to refund my money but the disappointment remains.,1523059200,,387,4.791044776119403

4409845,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Delightfully entertaining !  The charm like the leche....milky and generous.  The pace is fun and funny in many places and most of all, as Mom, and soon Grandmother, the undercurrents in the story are of the best character and integrity - for the young mind, there is good-portrayed-as-good, evil-portrayed-as-evil, and the main characters display complexities of good and evil, deliberate evil, and to make the children think - evil things NOT done deliberately at all,  but evilly created by others to harm them - as is all evil - a creation created to do harm.

Technically - the quality was super - music, images, sound effects, film editing - what to leave in and what to trim out -  yes, well done!

Plus Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, wow....a fine pairing in film for adults did it here with the very best spirit for the family and children.....just Thank you.",1517529600,,871,4.773333333333333

Being late to the Puss in Boots party,  my kids have asked for Puss in Boots toys while they're no longer offered in toy stores, so I've found myself trolling ebay for ""vintage"" Puss in Boots plush toys, etc.  This movie has inspired quite a lot of imaginative play in my house for the past 2 yrs. and never seems to lose steam... My daughter has dressed up for Halloween as Puss in Boots and my Aunt has actually brought one of their ""Poots"" (as they call him) on vacation with her in order to photograph him on various adventures, which my two older daughters later narrate in Antonio Banderas-like voices... lots of silly, funny moments.",1454889600,2,765,4.442857142857143

The reason I saw it a second time was to introduce it to someone who had not seen it before.  I don't think he would have watched it on his own.  I would have given it five stars is not for the fact that the action slowed with the telling of Puss' life story or that some of the action sequences went on a bit too long.

4411901,4,B004LWZW7Y,"He is not an outlaw; he is...the most interesting cat in the world!

If you loved him in ""Shrek"" 2, 3, and 4, you'll probably love him even more in this 2011 animation devoted entirely to that charming and lovable cat, Puss in Boots.  Although the film doesn't really say so, it is clearly a prequel to the ""Shrek"" films, providing a background on Puss's childhood and the growth of his legend as a desperado, hero, and lover.  And for what it's worth, the new film is superior to any of the ""Shrek"" movies in which he's appeared.

Directed by Chris Miller, who helmed the third ""Shrek"" film, the new ""Puss in Boots"" gets a big lift from not only Miller's continuing influence but the returning presence of Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss.  Banderas has just the right amount of self-assurance in the vocal characterization, the right amount of heroic dash and &eacute;lan, the right amount of romantic bearing to keep our attention.  And it helps that Banderas's voice is almost instantly recognizable.  He makes Puss the ""fashionable, famous outlaw"" of his claims.  ""What can I say; I was a bad kitty.""  What's more, he helps the cat throw ""a long shadow.""

The story takes us back to Puss's childhood, somewhere in a make-believe land that looks remarkably like Spain in some indefinite, long-ago time period, and we learn of his adoption by a kindly lady, Mama Imelda (Constance Marie), who raises him along with about 800 other children and animals.  Of course, in cartoons such as this one, humans and animals coexist as equals, speaking to one another in a perfectly natural manner as though it were the most common thing in the world.  So, it's here in Mama Imelda's home that Puss meets the character with whom he will become both a best friend and a worst enemy for life, Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a highly conflicted egg.  Although the animators vividly capture Humpty's appearance, Galifianakis's voice realization is perhaps the weakest link in the film's chain of characters because he doesn't have as distinctive a voice as the other actors.  Still, he gives it his all and alternates between our loving and loathing his character.

Humpty continually gets the young Puss in trouble, leading to one of the movie's two primary conflicts, which is the question of whether Puss can trust Humpty or not.  The second conflict relates to the first; namely, when Puss and Humpty grow up, they plot how they can steal the celebrated magic beans that will take them to the Giant's castle in the clouds, wherein they hope to find the goose that lays the golden eggs that will make them rich.  Obviously, the movie combines fairy tales and nursery-rhyme characters of all kinds in a rich tapestry of escapades.

The film's third major character is Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss's companion in adventure (after a brief period of rivalry) and the film's main romantic interest.  She is a cat burglar, voiced to excellent effect by Ms. Hayek, who often upstages Banderas's Puss, both figuratively and literally.  In either case, Ms. Hayek and her character make perfect counterpoints to Banderas's Puss in Boots, and she soon joins Puss and Humpty in their search for the magic beans.

Along the way, Puss, Kitty, and Humpty meet up with a number of other children's storybook characters, the most important of them being Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris), who in this tale are villains.  They are the ones who have the magic beans in their possession, so it is they whom our heroes must rob in order to get them.  Needless to say, Jack and Jill, two rather rough-looking rogues, are not keen on giving up the beans, and the couple show up throughout the film as antagonists.

Anyway, the film does almost everything right, starting with the gorgeous animation by the DreamWorks team.  The amount of detail, dimension, and individuality they put into their creations is striking, the equal of the best-looking cartoons you'll ever see.  Just as important, ""Puss in Boots"" is a fast-paced, amusing adventure for all ages.  It's clever and witty enough for adults to appreciate and colorful and zany enough for children to enjoy.  Moreover, it's adventurous enough for anyone to like, no matter what their age.

Early on, there's a ""Dance Fight"" at a local canteen that's wonderfully inventive and musically entertaining in a flamenco-inflected manner; the sequence is one of the highlights of the show.  Then, the segments at the Giant's castle are quite thrilling, as are several other episodes.  In all, ""Puss and Boots"" delivers the goods in terms of sheer beauty and excitement.  No, there isn't any mention of Shrek or Donkey, who would presumably come into Puss's life later on, but at no time during the present film do we care, we're having such a good time without them.  That's pretty high praise for the movie right there.

Video:
Using an MPEG-4/AVC encode and a dual-layer BD50, the DreamWorks team produce an opulently detailed succession of colors and images.  Combine the high-definition picture with the beauty and complexity of the animation, and you get a spectacular visual feast, one that equals most Pixar creations as well as DreamWorks's own ""How to Train Your Dragon.""  It's in that league, and a very exclusive league it is, too.

Audio:
One can surely have no objection to the sound:  The DW engineers use a lossless Dolby TrueHD codec and 7.1 channels to reproduce the movie's soundtrack.  The results are inevitable:  The movie sounds great.  We get clean, clear, dynamic audio, with excellent, pinpoint surround activity and a smooth, natural midrange.  The movie is as much fun to listen to as it is to watch.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc Combo Pack contains a ton of extras, mostly aimed at children.  First up is a thirteen-minute short subject, ""Puss in Boots:  The Three Diablos,"" with our hero involved in a new animated adventure.  Next comes a series of Blu-ray exclusives.  These include ""A DreamWorks Fairytale"" in which users can build their own nursery rhymes; ""Puss' Paw-Pouncing Challenge,"" a game played rather awkwardly with one's remote; ""The Animator's Corner,"" a picture-in-picture commentary; and a pop-up Trivia Track.

After those items, we get previews of other DreamWorks attractions; ""Pur-fect Pairing:  The Voices Behind the Legends,"" nine minutes on the voice characterizations in the movie; ""Kitten to Cat:  The Progression of Puss in Boots,"" twelve minutes on the main character; three deleted scenes; ""Glitter Box Dance-Off,"" five minutes on how to dance like the movie's stars; ""Klepto Kitty,"" three minutes on a real-life cat thief; ""Kitty Keyboard,"" a musical selection; a ""Fairytale Pop-up Book""; ""Kitty Strikes Again,"" another game; and ""World of DreamWorks Animation,"" which looks at yet more DW movies.

The extras on disc one conclude with eighteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two contains a DVD of the movie and a digital copy for iTunes and Windows Media, the offer expiring on February 24, 2013.  The two discs come housed in a solid Blu-ray keep case, making one hope the studios are giving up or at least reconsidering the flimsy Eco-cases they've been using for a while.  A light-cardboard slipcover encloses the case.

Parting Thoughts:
At first I had my doubts about ""Puss in Boots.""  I wasn't too sure a spin-off character from ""Shrek"" would work, and I didn't figure the character alone, without support from Shrek or Donkey, could maintain my attention for ninety minutes.  But work it did and splendidly, too, aided not inconsiderably by the movie's beautiful animation and the Blu-ray disc's outstanding picture and sound.  In any case, the results are entertaining, making the movie one of the best animated features of the year.

4411964,3,B004LWZW7Y,"I've enjoyed most of the Shrek movies, especially Antonio Banderas' character of Puss in Boots.  So when they announced a spin off movie focused on this character, I knew I'd have to see it.  It was diverting, but it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.

Puss has spent the last seven years on the run, staying one step ahead of those who want to arrest him for the bounty on his head - a bounty for a crime he didn't commit.  When he hears rumors that notorious villains Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) have magic beans, Puss thinks this might be the way to make reparations and clear his good name.

The only problem is that Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) is also on the trail of those beans.  Humpty and Puss used to be friends and partners until one of them betrayed the other.  Will Puss team up with Humpty and his new partner, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek)?

It's not quite eggs over easy to place my finger on exactly what went wrong with this movie.  There are certainly some good jokes.  But it didn't have the humor of the earlier Shrek movies.  Instead, it felt like something put together because they knew it would make money.  I'll confess, it did get me into the theater.  Puss is usually one of the funniest characters, but maybe because he had to play the lead instead of the wacky side kick, he wasn't nearly as funny as usual.

The story is pretty much by the numbers.  I may not have had all the twists figured out early on, but there was little there that truly surprised me.  That's not the kiss of death for a movie, but there has to be something else to keep me engaged.

It doesn't help that the pacing was way off.  I spent much of the movie waiting for things to kick into high gear.  There are some fun moments of humor or action.  I did love the first fight between Puss and Kitty, for example.

Likewise, I enjoyed seeing how they worked various nursery rhymes into the story.  If they had put that creativity into the entire story, it would have been fun.  There is a very old west/Zorro feel to the film, which I found lots of fun and fitting for the character.

The animation looks a step up from the last Shrek movie, but it is still very stylized.  It works for the movie, and it never threw me out of the film.

Outside of the cast I've already named, most of the voice cast are unknowns.  In fact, I recognized quite a few of the production staff in the voice staff.  That's not a flaw of the movie, however.  None of the voice cast did a bad job.

In the end, Puss in Boots is a mildly entertaining film.  I would see it again, but I wouldn't rush out to see it again.",1432425600,,2646,4.253012048192771

4412229,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Love it! What else can I say.  Puss inBoots is my favorite of all the Dream Works characters and apparently others agree with me.  I've seen this DVD probably four times now and I laugh each time as if I've never seen it before.

It's the old story of the two friendsm juvenile partners in crime, parting because one betrayed the other, and their reunion and redemption through a final fantastic heist.  The cliche has been told a million times in who knows how many crime film dramas.  Here it's on a much more fantastic and comedic scale as Puss is reunited with his old orphanage mate Humpty Alexander Dumpty and his partner, the delectable Kitty Softpaws, to find the magic beans growing a beanstalk to the deserted castle where the goose laying the golden eggs lives.

My favorite part:  The Tuesday Night Dance Fight....litter box moves and all.  All the story's great however...the innuendos laughable, the animation fantastic. I love the way Puss alternates between suave Cat about Town and adventurer and plain ol' cat chasing a spot of light around and around and coughing up hairballs.

I know I'll be watching it again.  Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it so I wouldn't be ordering it continually from Netflix!",1426550400,,1223,4.780952380952381

4412406,5,B004LWZW7Y,"The movie is quite funny, very entertaining. My review, though, is more on the 3D aspect and the sound quality of the 3D bluray. The encoded high definition sound on the disc is Dolby True HD 7.1 (unlike many discs with only 5.1), and for those who may not have Dolby True HD or DTS HD decoders, the disc also has Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, still a very good sounding choice. The Dolby 7.1 soundtrack is done very well on this disc, with very well-defined localizations (things sound as though they are coming from where they should be coming from, such as behind you or even overhead). The sound is not harsh and does not cause listener fatigue the way many movie soundtracks can, and often do. This movie sounds great. The picture is top notch as well. Many animated films look amazing, including this movie. The colors might be a little exaggerated,  but what color is an animated puss in boots??? The 3D is also very good, is appropriate (not over done in a cheesy way like some movies) and adds to the experience, rather than distracting from it or feeling thrown in. If you are sensitive to 3D and experience eye strain, I would rate this movie quite low on the strain scale (ie. it doesn't strain your eyes very much at all). Overall a great, fun experience with wonderful sound and a really good 3D experience.",1424044800,2,1325,4.520833333333333

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The DreamWorks 3D animation film `Puss in Boots' was conceived in the wake of Shrek 2's phenomenal box office success, one of the ways DreamWorks Animation thought to expand and extend its prosperous flagship franchise. In the years since, the public's love of all things Shrek dried up, making the fourth and final animation was the time to say goodbye.

Probably a result of that, `Puss in Boots' makes no effort to connect this one-off to the series from which it spun. The title character is the same one who prominently featured in all three Shrek sequels: the gallant Latin orange tabby cat, voiced as always by Antonio Banderas in Zorro mode. And `Puss in Boots' own animation film makes use of a few other famous fairy tale characters. In genre and tone, though, this represents a departure from the jokey ogre comedies.

Pop culture references are virtually non-existent. There is very little send-up of fairy tale conventions, Disney, or Hollywood. The celebrity voice cast is on the small side, both in number and stature. This is actually about as straight and irony-free of an adventure film as you could get from this studio and this character. That doesn't appear to be a bad thing. `Puss in Boots' received better reviews than the last two Shrek chapters and the Best Animated Feature Oscar nomination that they did not.

`Puss in Boots' takes place before `Shrek 2.' The feline Don Juan is a wanted outlaw in the village of San Ricardo. He is in pursuit of magical beans held by murderous human couple Jack [Billy Bob Thornton] and Jill [Amy Sedaris]. The mission brings Puss face-to-masked face with a mysterious, nimble stranger, who is revealed, after a prolonged dance fight, to be Kitty Softpaws [Salma Hayek], a declawed street-smart grey cat. Kitty is working in tandem with Puss' estranged friend Humpty Alexander Dumpty [Zach Galifianakis]. Puss objects to reteaming with the egghead and we get the detailed explanation why. Backstory reveals that Puss and Humpty grew up in an orphanage as brothers and were torn apart when their mischievous adventures turned into crime (hence, Puss' fugitive status). Fresh out of jail, Humpty is both apologetic and forgiving, and with a little encouragement, Puss is as well.

Thus, the scene is set for the three allies to swipe the glowing beans from Jack and Jill and await a giant beanstalk that will lead them to the riches of a goose that lays golden eggs. Once a studio known for derivation, innuendo, and fart jokes, DreamWorks has matured, now placing storytelling and animation high on their priority list. As always, the character of Puss lends to comedic uses of recognizable cat behavior. Those earn the biggest laughs, but the movie is willing to put humour on the back burner to tell its surprisingly sophisticated swashbuckling tale of betrayal, deception, and danger. You don't expect to invest dramatically in a booted cat primarily used as comic relief in the wink/nod-filled Shrek films, but you do and are more than willing to forgive the long stretches without even mild hilarity.

Computer animation has been getting darker in recent years. PIXAR has made intense emotional response part of the family film going experience and DreamWorks has followed suit in their most recent efforts, which have raised tension and stakes to an increase in dramatic payoff and critical favour. And yet, `Puss in Boots' is far from a joyless experience. It is willing to follow its impulses, as in an all-out Puss/Kitty bar dance-off, and successfully deliver a quick joke, e.g. Puss' unfailingly funny big-eyed sympathy ploy, without undermining its focused vision and taut structure.

Furthermore, Puss may be its hero's fourth film, but it largely feels like its covering new ground, not adhering to Shrek's tired playbook or other DreamWorks formula in any way. Originality remains highly welcome in a medium that so quickly became ubiquitous and homogenous. Puss may not be the most entertaining animated film of all time, but it is nonetheless distinctive enough to stand out and be appreciated as more than just another page in the always-growing DreamWorks catalogue.

There has already been talk of a `Puss in Boots' sequel, but I would hope that the studio doesn't feel obligated to make a follow-up with or without actual demand and creativity. No one can dispute that DreamWorks Animation has been improving and that quality suddenly seems to be an important factor in the company's strategy. I only hope that they don't forget the lesson learned on Shrek and avoid taking the similar ""too much, too soon"" approach that they seem to be simultaneously using on Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon.

Blu-ray Video Quality - DreamWorks scratches out a very strong Blu-ray 3D transfer for `Puss in Boots' and needless to say, this presentation mimics all of the goodness from the 2D-only release, itself a spectacular triumph of Blu-ray video. While textures like Puss' leathery hat, wood and stone, and Humpty's body retain the same intricate levels of digital craftsmanship, the image proves a hair darker in spots are particularly in the already dimly-lit early sequences. Still, the image passes for extraordinary, with cat fur, desert terrain, and the like immaculately presented, the brighter scenes losing almost nothing to the 3D process. Likewise, colours are bold and steady, with Puss' orange fur coat, golden eggs, metallic armour, yellow chicks, and all sorts of earth tones appearing gorgeously balanced and true. `Puss in Boots' looks fantastic in 3D, and the movie plays nicely with the added dimension. Surely, the sense of true depth is the real key here, as it usually is with any good Blu-ray 3D release.

The film doesn't play with too many gimmick effects, but an assortment of gold coins flying about in slow motion in chapter eight, rain appearing to fall out of the screen on the way up the beanstalk, or a flying dagger that seems to start its journey outside of the screen and wind up inside of it will all dazzle. Unfortunately, crosstalk is a rather constant problem, but one that's not excessively intrusive. Mostly, it seems objects not the centre of attention in any given scene are most susceptible. Overall, however, this is a glorious presentation that's amongst the better of the current Blu-ray 3D transfers on the market.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - `Puss in Boots' purrs up a storm with a high quality 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. DreamWorks' audio presentation offers rich, lively music that plays with fantastic spacing, seamless clarity, and an immersive surround element. The track rarely fails to dazzle in all areas, music being only one. Natural ambience is precise and aids greatly in pulling the audience into the adventure. Whether chatter at a pub, light echoing, reverberating footsteps, crickets, or other subtle elements, this track proves capable of placing everything precisely and with attention to detail to match exactly the on- and off-screen action alike. Cat meows, purrs, and hisses are done very well and authentically. Action scenes are wondrously spaced and absolutely immersive, the track making fine use of the entire stage. Cannon fire, crumbling rocks, and other chaotic elements are handled crisply and with great clarity. The only downside is that bass lacks a heavier punch in a few instances, failing to provide that last little bit of oomph to truly make the effects more pronounced and dangerous. Otherwise, the track is immensely impressive, rounded out by clear and accurate dialogue.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

`Puss in Boots' Blu-ray 3D release contains all of the extras available on the standalone 2D release, all appearing on this set's 2D-only disc. The 3D disc includes Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos and a trailer for Madagascar 3, both, of course, in 3D.

Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos [1080p] [13:05] This short is included on both the 3D and 2D Blu-ray Discs, but is not included on the DVD disc. The Three Diablos is a fun little adventure where Puss has to take ""custody"" of three devilish kittens that are the key to solving a crime committed against the queen. DreamWorks packs a lot of fun and great action into this 13 minute feature - definitely worth inclusion in this package - and who doesn't like ""adorable"" little kittens...

A DreamWorks Fairy Tale [1080p] A fun little interactive feature in which users can create their own ""character rhymes"" by selecting from a predetermined list of words. For example, ""Little Boy Blue, come roar your guitar. Puss is in the meadow, Jill is in the corn; where is that cat who looks after the cupcakes? Under the haystack fast asleep. Will you wake him? Oh no, not I.""

Puss' Paw Pouncing Challenge [1080p] Players can help Puss pounce on the light by controlling his paws with the remote control.

The Animators' Corner: Director Chris Miller and Producers Joe Aguilar and Latifa Ouaou host an enthralling picture-in-picture feature that contains looks at storyboards and animation tests and features cast and crew explaining in some detail the animation process, the process of creating environments and characters, the ironing out the plot, voicing the characters, the attention paid to even the most subtle elements to round the movie into shape, character design, resizing Puss from Shrek to the world of Puss in Boots, and much more. This supplement sheds an amazing amount of light on the story and the creative process behind it. This is a must-watch.

Trivia Track [1080p] A small banner at the bottom of the screen provides viewers with a wealth of information about the movie, cats, and more. It even keeps track of the number of ""Meows"" heard in the film.

Purr-fect Pairing: The Voices Behind the Legend [1080p] [9:21] A close look at the work of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianakis, and Billy Bob Thornton.

Deleted Scenes [1080p] [7:27] Humpty Plots with Jack & Jill (Test), Humpty Repays His Accomplices (Test),  and Puss in Boots Fights the Giant (Test).

Kitten to Cat [1080p] [12:01] Cast and crew talk up the Puss in Boots character, his story, and his visual progression beginning with the Shrek films and on through Puss in Boots.

Glitter Box Dance Off! [1080p] [5:01] Human dancers demonstrate the dance choreography as seen in the film.

Klepto Kitty [1080p] [3:42] Viewers are introduced to ""Dusty,"" a real-life ""cat burglar.""

Kitty Keyboard [1080p] Viewers are ""treated"" to feline keyboard renditions of 3 Blind Mice, Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, and Little Boy Blue.

Fairytale Pop-Up Book [1080p] Viewers may watch ""Memorable Moments"" from, hear ""Favourite Lines"" spoken by, view a ""Gallery"" containing artist renditions of, and learn more about the backgrounds of Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, Humpty Dumpty, and Jack and Jill.

Kitty Strikes Again [1080p] Viewers are challenged to find the differences between nearly-identical pictures.

World of DreamWorks Animation [1080p] Music, trailers, and more for Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar, and Megamind.

Previews [1080p] Madagascar 3 - Europe's Most Wanted [3D/2D] and Shrek - The Musical.

Finally, DreamWorks' take on `Puss in Boots' is yet another good effort from DreamWorks Animation, doing its part to distance the studio from its old reputation as a crass Pixar knock-off and reinforce its new one as one of the most reliably entertaining and increasingly sophisticated makers of family films. DreamWorks has yet to have a film reach the same magical heights as most of PIXAR, but their non-sequels are consistently three-star quality or better (and so, for that matter, are some of their sequels). The studio continues to load up their films with fun and substantial bonus features. Puss' combo pack offers plenty of each and truly adds value and enjoyment. Plus, it nearly goes without saying that the movie itself looks and sounds positively amazing in high definition. The film certainly merits a look and this utterly satisfying presentation of it is one you're not likely to regret buying. DreamWorks' Blu-ray 3D release of `Puss in Boots' contains the same spectacular 7.1  soundtrack and fun array of supplements both found on the 2D only release, adding the short film and a trailer in 3D. The Blu-ray 3D transfer is stunningly superb. This is one of the better overall releases of the year to date. And as I am a massive big fan of the Shrek franchise, this 3D Blu-ray of `Puss in Boots' is a brilliant DreamWorks companion and if you want to see something very funny, action packed, with also a witty script and brilliant characters, then you will not go wrong with this Blu-ray disc and that is why it has now gone into my DreamWorks Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

I have been a fan of the Shrek films since the first one but my favorite character has always been Puss. So when I learned that he was getting his own film I was all about. When it was released to theaters there I was along with my girl and little cuz to check it out, I loved it. So then I was waiting for the DVD or Blu-Ray to hit the streets. When I finally did I went straight out and bought it that day, naturally we watched it that night.

Puss is an outlaw just living his life by his own code until he runs into another thief who is as good as him. After hunting this person down through the streets he learns what this other cat is all about, she is Kitty Soft Paws. She is also working for someone who Puss knows very personally, Humpty Alexander Dumpty. As it turns out Humpty needs Pusss help to fulfill a childhood fantasy that they both once shared. Puss doesnt know if he can trust his old friend but adventure waits if he takes the chance.

I absolutely loved this movie and have watched it various times since I have bought it. The animation looks great as DreamWorks always brings it. The writing was good as this was a very fun movie that even us adults will enjoy. The play on the different fairy tales much like the Shrek flicks works so great. The characters and story are fun and Zach did an excellent job as Humpty. Antonio and Selma are excellent as they always are together and the same can be said for the entire cast. The Blu-Ray comes with all kinds of special features including a short featuring Puss and three little dangerous kittens.",1400025600,,1582,4.249169435215947
4413685,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I absolutely loved this retelling of an old fable! The mix with Zorro gives cultural background to which kids would not be exposed otherwise!

The dialog and energy between these two characters sparkles and made me forgive (after long years of grumbling) Disney's decision to change Puss from a French character to a Spanish one. And of course, the animation is gorgeous.

There are also some bad things about this movie. I didn't care for the bumbling-is-he-a-bad-egg Humpty Dumpty, whose character makes less and less sense as the story goes on. The plot twists (yes, I care about these even in a disney movie) are very poorly thought out - there's basically no reason for any of the end of the story to happen and I found sitting through the ""will the bad guys come through after all"" cliches at the end painfully tedious.

Studio: DreamWorks Animation SKG

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The animation film `Puss in Boots' was conceived in the wake of `Shrek 2' phenomenal box office success, one of the ways DreamWorks Animation thought to expand and extend its prosperous flagship franchise. In the years since, the public's love of all things 'Shrek' had dried up, making the fourth and final film's reception less enjoyable.

Probably a result of that, Puss makes no effort to connect this one-off to the series from which it spun. The title character is the same one who prominently featured in all three 'Shrek' sequels: the gallant Latin orange tabby cat, voiced as always by Antonio Banderas in Zorro mode. And Puss' own film makes use of a few other famous fairy tale characters. In genre and tone, though, this represents a departure from the jokey ogre comedies.

`Puss n Boots' takes place before Shrek 2.' The feline Don Juan is a wanted outlaw in the village of San Ricardo. He is in pursuit of magical beans held by murderous human couple Jack (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). The mission brings Puss face-to-masked face with a mysterious, nimble stranger, who is revealed, after a prolonged dance fight, to be Kitty Softpaws [Salma Hayek], a declawed street-smart grey cat.

Kitty is working in tandem with Puss' estranged friend Humpty Alexander Dumpty [Zach Galifianakis]. Puss objects to reteaming with the egghead and we get the detailed explanation why. Backstory reveals that Puss and Humpty grew up in an orphanage as brothers and were torn apart when their mischievous adventures turned into crime, hence, Puss' fugitive status. Fresh out of jail, Humpty is both apologetic and forgiving, and with a little encouragement, Puss is as well. Thus, the scene is set for the three allies to swipe the glowing beans from Jack and Jill and await a giant beanstalk that will lead them to the riches of a goose that lays golden eggs.

Computer animation has been getting darker in recent years. PIXAR has made intense emotional response part of the family animation film going experience and DreamWorks has followed suit in their most recent efforts, which have raised tension and stakes to an increase in dramatic payoff and critical favour. And yet, Puss in Boots is far from a joyless experience. It is willing to follow its impulses, as in an all-out Puss/Kitty bar dance-off, and successfully deliver a quick joke, e.g. Puss' unfailingly funny big-eyed sympathy ploy, without undermining its focused vision and taut structure.

Furthermore, Puss may be its hero's fourth film, but it largely feels like its covering new ground, not adhering to Shrek's tired playbook or other DreamWorks formula in any way. Originality remains highly welcome in a medium that so quickly became ubiquitous and homogenous. Puss may not be the most entertaining animated film of all time, but it is nonetheless distinctive enough to stand out and be appreciated as more than just another page in the always-growing DreamWorks catalogue.

There has already been talk of a 'Puss in Boots' sequel, but I would hope that the studio doesn't feel obligated to make a follow-up with or without actual demand and creativity. No one can dispute that DreamWorks Animation has been improving and that quality suddenly seems to be an important factor in the company's strategy. I only hope that they don't forget the lesson learned on 'Shrek' and avoid taking the similar ""too much, too soon"" approach.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Puss in Boots' razzle-dazzles and charms his way onto Blu-ray with those big adorable eyes and refuses to let go. He isn't quite the perfect match for the very best in the 3D arena, revealing some minor gaffes in his dance moves, but he knows how to amaze at the right moments and puts on a great show nonetheless. In spite of the dark glasses, the 1080p image quality is vivid and saturated in rich, warm colours which leap off the screen. Yellows, oranges and reds are especially dazzling, giving the animation an energetic, tepid appeal. There's some very light banding around the softer, pastel hues in a couple of exterior scenes, but only noticeable when looking for it. The presentation is extraordinarily bright, with pitch-perfect contrast, bringing out every background object in the far-distance with splendid clarity. Black levels are full-bodied and ample in every scene, providing the image with a great deal of dimension throughout. Many shadowy sequences, which there are plenty of, tend to engulf some of the specifics within the picture. Daylight scenes are, of course, best, exposing every line and feature on the Spanish architecture of the towns and in the rocky landscape of the desert plains. The fine hairs making up the furry coats of the two feline heroes are distinct and move with incredible lifelike simplicity. The stitching around the clothing of various characters is remarkably well-defined with beautifully detailed texture on Puss's hat and boots. In the 3D realm, the transfer displays gorgeous depth and a terrific breadth of range, generating a convincing sense of size and proportion. Foreground objects show excellent separation from the rest of the picture and appear to move independently of the background. In many sequences, particularly those with lots of action, the image has a great pop-up book effect with several layers that move deep into the screen and nicely create the illusion of three-dimensional space. Unfortunately, it isn't always consistent with some scenes looking flatter than others, often those with dim lighting like the darkly-lit interiors mentioned above. The few 3D gimmicks don't really protrude from the screen with believability, and crosstalk is a regular nuisance around objects in the far distance, especially every time the moon makes an appearance. All in all, the animated spinoff makes for an excellent and enjoyable 3D presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is the same 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack heard on the standard Blu-ray release, and it's a highly entertaining design where the music takes centre stage. Henry Jackman's original score makes terrific use of the sound field, spreading evenly throughout the sound system and marvellously enveloping the listener. Other minor discrete effects meant for ambience try to participate in the background, but are not quite as convincing. The swashbuckling action, however, displays flawless panning movement and directionality into the rears, enhancing the sound field satisfyingly. In the front speakers, the soundstage is expansive and welcoming, creating a wonderful, spacious image that's engaging. The music, again, is most impressive with a superb, crystal-clear mid-range, allowing for each instrument in the orchestra to be perfectly heard without the slightest distortion. The graceful kitty dance-off scene is a true highlight of the lossless mix where viewers can enjoy the pluck of individual strings on the guitar and detect every step of the character's dance moves. Vocal remain intelligible and precise amid the noise and chaos. The low-end is fairly deep and weighty for the music, but explosive action sequences don't seem to have a very persuasive oomph. Nonetheless, the track is a great joy, and it adds plenty of delight to the animation film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: All the special features found on the 2D Blu-ray release are also shared in this 3D edition.

Special Feature: Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos [1080p] [13:00] In it, Princess Alessandra hires Puss to retrieve the stolen Heart of Fire ruby from The Whisperer. Doing so, he must get information from three adorably mischievous kittens who witnessed the theft. It's a sweet and funny cartoon that is every bit as polished technically as the film itself, even boasting a 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio sound. This is a truly amazing in 3D experience.

Special Feature: A DreamWorks Fairytale [1080p] It allows you to construct a rarely rhyming rhyme choosing characters, objects, and actions from three options. It's basically like a clean, uncreative Mad Libs whose results, which are read to you, aren't likely to make anyone but the very young laugh.

Special Feature: Puss' Paw Pouncing Challenge [1080p] This is a fun, clever little game in which you move a paw target to catch colourful lights, just like Puss would. The lights increase and move faster with each level, making it more challenging and fun as you progress. It's nothing that you'll want to play for more than a few minutes, but it does best DVD's limited set-top games.

Three deleted Scenes [1080p] [7:27] Are introduced by producer Latifa Ouaou and presented in story reel form with temporary track recordings. Most notable is the one featuring a human giant who is shown up in a traditional, heroic fashion.

Special Feature: Kitten to Cat [1080p] [12:00] Cast and crew interviews discuss the evolution of the character over the years and within the franchise. They celebrate the film's hero, reflecting on his appearance in the `Shrek' films, considering how to spin the character off here, pondering what he makes him tick, and looking at the dance choreography done for this film.

Special Feature: Glitter Box Dance Off! [1080p] [5:00] A closer-look at the dance choreography seen in the animation film and teaches you the choreography employed for the film's two dance sequences.

Special Feature: Klepto Kitty [1080p] [3:42] Amusing news footage of a cat that steals and profiles Dusty, a California cat who steals items from neighbours' yards, some of it captured on night vision camera. It doesn't really relate to the film, though a few clips try to make a connection, but I'm all for cat shorts, when the cat is this compelling.

Special Feature: Kitty Keyboard [1080p] Video showing a kitty keyboardist playing some favourite nursery rhymes and treats you to four cute, creative animated shorts depicting musical interpretations of nursery rhymes ""performed by cats.""

Special Feature: Fairytale Pop-Up Book [1080p] Interactive feature allowing users to learn more about the characters, watch memorable scenes, hear favourite lines and look at artist drawings pertaining to each and devotes a section to each of the following: Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, Humpty Dumpty, and Jack and Jill. Each gets a montage of ""Memorable Moments"", a ""Favorite Line"", a descriptive paragraph, and a light gallery of concept art. Fashioned like a pop-up book, this kid-oriented content is good and nicely presented.

Special Feature: Kitty Strikes Again [1080p] An interactive challenge game where players must find the difference between two pictures and treats you to five split-screen image comparisons in which you've got to find what Kitty Softpaws has stolen (i.e. what is different between the two pics). Each level asks you to find more differences. It's adequately executed and reasonably challenging.

Special Feature: World of DreamWorks Animation and Trailers [1080p] The extras conclude with the long-standard World of DreamWorks Animation section, which serves up ads and promotional music videos for Megamind' and Shrek,' Kung Fu Panda,' `Madagascar' and `How to Train Your Dragon' franchises. It's a good use of otherwise unused disc space, both for the studio and those compelled to sample their other series.

Finally, `Puss in Boots' is yet another good effort from DreamWorks Animation, especially now it is in glorious 3D, doing its part to distance the studio from its old reputation as a poor PIXAR imitation and reinforce its new one as one of the most reliably entertaining and increasingly sophisticated makers of family films. DreamWorks has yet to have a film reach the same magical heights as most of PIXAR, but their non-sequels are consistently three-star quality or better (and so, for that matter, are some of their sequels). The studio continues to load up their films with fun and substantial bonus features. Puss' combo pack offers plenty of each and truly adds value and enjoyment. Plus, it nearly goes without saying that the animation film itself looks and sounds positively amazing in high definition. The film certainly merits a look and this utterly satisfying presentation is one you're not likely to regret buying and all in all this is to me a fantastic addition to my Blu-ray Collection and again, I cannot praise the 3D presentation enough, as it is totally awesome and the DreamWorks team are also very inventive and watching this brilliant 3D Blu-ray many times, you will see something different every time. But if you want to impress your friends and relations, then I can assure you they will be awe struck in what they view, as it is a totally magical experience and I am so proud to add this to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Had a good story line, great animation and was an enjoyable surprise. I think it deserves the rare but coveted award of 5 Orville popcorn bags for great creativity and wonderful animation. No sexual innuendos that makes you wish you had a kill button so little Johnny and Jill would not get an education while watching.",1388361600,,479,4.274725274725275

But this one - I've been waiting for this a long time. Absolutely as great as I thought it would be. The cat stole the show before, now he's the star. That's all you need to know. Seriously. Corny funny crazy animated movie with massive cat humor - the dance sequences had me roaring out loud. Oh yes. Cats do have Dance Fights. It gets crazy. They're cats. What can I say! Well done! Cat lovers will have an extra layer of delight in this one, because the creators really do know cats!

4414614,4,B004LWZW7Y,"Puss in Boots is one of the better spinoffs to come out in recent years. Skillfully, with gorgeous animation, colourful characters, and impeccable voice work, the movie tells the untold story of our favourite feline bandito - the one and only Puss...in Boots! Set in sandy deserts, dust-swept towns, and with a distinctive Fistful of Dollars feel, Puss in Boots accomplishes something impressive indeed; being a smart film, entertaining for both kids and adults, with an emotional core that satisfies younger audiences and critics, I call Puss in Boots a success!

This is in no small part to the fantastic, detailed, atmospheric, rich world that our characters live in. Thanks no doubt in part to executive producer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guillermo-del-Toro-s/dp/B003Y1D7UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guillermo del Toro's</a>&nbsp;practiced eye for atmosphere, lush detail, and stunning cinematography. Watching the movie, one is reminded of Sergio Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy, with several clever nods to famous spaghetti westerns present, and the old Zorro TV shows, including Antonio Banderas' fantastic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-Of-Zorro/dp/B000LY1OA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask Of Zorro</a>.

But visually is not the only area Puss in Boots succeeds. The voicework is incredibly good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zach-Galifianakis/dp/B002RVCCUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zach Galifianakis</a>&nbsp;is excellent as the shifty Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty., and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salma-Hayek/dp/B007HJ9LXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salma Hayek</a>&nbsp;is also impeccable as Kitty Soft-Paws, a literal cat burglar. While the rest of the cast is beyond criticism, the real star (once again) here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antonio-Banderas/dp/B0048LVDHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antonio Banderas</a>, whose silky-smooth, charismatic voice lends great gravitas and charm to the adventure-seeking, boot-wearing, milk-lapping, sword-wielding, fast-talking eponymous Puss in Boots.

The story is nothing new or groundbreaking, nor is the movie especially weighty or dramatic, but for kids, and even for adults savvy enough to catch the references, Puss in Boots is an entertaining, action-packed, funny, witty, gorgeously animated adventure! My rating? 4 magic beans out of five.

Maybe it is just me (but i think not) but I never belly laughed so hard. It made me think of my cat's over and over again, and I love how Puss saunters up to the bar and........oh, gee I don't want to give too much away.

4414617,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I watched this after watching all of the Shrek movies, and here is my take on it: It is a fun and entertaining movie, with a pleasant mix of action, funniness and little bit of betrayal.

4414713,4,B004LWZW7Y,"Our little orphaned Puss, in order to help his adopted mother, sets off on a quest to find the goose that laid the golden egg. Actually he's after some magic beans... Or... Oh rats! It's too complicated to go into here, but suffice it to say, our favorite gato hits a few snags along the way. Replay your DVD from Amazon if you want to figure it out.

Of course, we have a lot of amigos to help:
  * Antonio Banderas (""Haywire"") is our eponymous orange tabby, resourceful, macho and (trying to be) trustworthy.
  * Salma Hayek (""Grown Ups"") is Kitty Softpaws (she's been de-clawed), a tough but oh so gentle, little gray and white pussycat. She's also a bit of a flirt.
  * Zach Galifianakis (""Due Date"") is Humpty Dumpty; with friends like this, who needs... Oh, you know... (...but I liked that ingenuous little sprinkle of freckles...)
  * Billy Bob Thornton (""Faster"") is Jack (of Jack and Jill notoriety). This dastardly duo blasts around the frontier in a wagon pulled by a team of javalinas.
  * Amy Sedaris (lots of TV) is Jill, Jack's better (?!) half. They are after the goose that laid the golden egg (see above).

I loved the Latino-flavored soundtrack, the flamenco dances, the swashbuckling sword fights, the dash across open country from a cat's-eye level, and, above all, being amazed by the subtle nuances displayed on each character's face.

4414865,3,B004LWZW7Y,"Given the success of the Puss character from the second Shrek film onward, one would get the feeling it would take a lot to screw up the origin story.  However, looking at the film as a whole, it certainly falls short of the expectations of the franchise on which it's based.  This isn't to suggest it's a total failure of course, so much as it seems the producers of this piece were oddly out of touch with what made the character (and the Shrek series in general) so endearing.

Coming in at runtime of 90-minutes and wearing an appropriate PG rating, 2011's Puss In Boots set DreamWorks back $130-million.  Believe it or not, the film was originally intended to be a direct-to-dvd affair before DreamWorks decided the character may have enough clout to potentially fill theaters.

The tale naturally revolves around Puss, and sets up the vain, confident, swashbuckler (voiced by Antonio Banderas) as a kitten with delusions of grandeur, made more achievable by an unlikely partnership with one Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis).  Before long the pair is on a quest to find the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, in hot pursuit by a murderous, drunkard Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), and teaming up with the feisty and seductive Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).

The majority of the film takes place in Spain and the surrounding deserts and while its visuals are undeniably DreamWorks, the film certainly lacks the vivid color pallet of the Shreks and instead relies upon a lot of moonlit and fire-lit scenes.  Despite moody tones and a fairly convoluted plot-line, the characters themselves are animated wonderfully with the titular character hilariously alternating between pint-sized swashbuckler and run-of-the-mill feline with regularity.

The film is laced with a lot of salsa-flavored tunes and beats and there are a number of requisite dance sequences to accompany the rhythmic tunes.  The pacing, however, isn't quite as butter-smooth as one would expect from a big budget Hollywood animated film.  Some of said dance numbers run on a bit too long and flashbacks to Puss' roots disrupt the natural flow of the present (which, if you want to be technical is still the past in the mythos).

In all Puss In Boots is a fun film from the director of Shrek The Third though a strong argument could be made that this isn't DreamWorks' biggest or best animated feature.  I'm of the opinion that the fairy tale integration isn't near as subliminal or well-placed as we've witnessed in the Shrek films and the uneven pacing makes it easy for very young viewers to become bored with the story.  However, the nuances of the characters themselves mixed with some moments of clever dialog do make it interesting enough for adults to sit through.  In all, it's a very good formula for a rental.",1364947200,,2816,4.8989473684210525

""Puss In Boots""
(Dreamworks, 2012)
-------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: mild spoilers below. and grumpiness.
-------------------------------------------------------------

My family were big fans of the Puss In Boots character in the Shrek movies, and when we saw the theater ad for this movie, we did little kitty conniptions and could hardly wait for it to come out. We all went together and saw it in the theater and... man, were we disappointed. The script really wasn't up to snuff, with a thin backstory for Puss, lackluster performances overall, and a strained, somewhat mechanistic, clunky plotline. The whole thing felt forced, insincere and uninspired. The Humpty Dumpty character was unpleasant for the sake of unpleasantness, and the ""twist"" of his being the bad guy was so predictable I had a dream about it a week before the movie came out. It really was a shame, because the Puss character was originally so vivid and hilarious, but this movie not only failed to live up to its own potential, it actually drained the life out of our enthusiasm for the hero kitt with the big shiny boots.

4415143,4,B004LWZW7Y,Got to love Puss!  Better than a simple spinoff from another movie as it the creators put thought into this one.  Our family has really enjoyed this.,1358553600,,149,4.481481481481482
4415144,3,B004LWZW7Y,"I am a pretty big fan of the ""Shrek"" series, minus (I believe) the second in the series.  Why is it that the first sequel to a series is always as ugly as an Ogre in the mud?  But then, when there is a third in a series, it usually cleans itself up and redeems itself?  The ""Shrek"" and ""Men in Black"" series are good examples of this.

But ""Puss in Boots"" (PIB) is a spinoff of ""Shrek"" I believe, and when PIB first released, I saw that quite a few critics seemed to believe that PIB was better than Shrek.  So, since I really liked Shrek, I was pretty psyched to watch this film.  Suffice it to say that I was more than mildly disappointed with PIB.

While the Shrek series was very clever in the way that it mixed modern day pop culture with older fairly tale creatures, this movie seems to just throw some characters in, well, just to throw them in.  The humor here just didn't seem to always land on its feet -- to risk using a bad cat metaphor -- but rather fell flat on its back.  And worse, there are just WAY too many double crosses here between the main characters.  At one point I thought to myself, ""OK, Puss.  I can buy the fact that you gave Humpty Dumpty another chance, but a third, maybe even a fourth?""  I just didn't buy it and it was aggravating to me.

I would say that if you're an adult, this film would be an unfortunate pass.  If you're a kid, say under 13 years old?  Maybe they'll find it amusing.",1358380800,,1423,4.105072463768116

I'm expecting another wherein Puss learns how to do battle with the Bad Guys, as long as we're doing Zorro parallels. Where is the wise Anthony Hopkins mentor that shows him the way of the world and how to use a sword? What about the boots? I thought the original was about him realizing he didn't need the boots to be excellent; it was all in his head.

4415714,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Puss in Boots(released Oct/11)stars Antonio Banderas back in the lead voice of Shrek's beloved character....Puss in Boots,of course. This animated film,from the same people at Dreamworks that gave us the Shrek franchise,features Puss in his own back story of his earlier life and how he became an outlaw,of sorts.
The plot takes place in San Ricardo as Puss in Boots returns to his hometown. He walks into a bar and is made fun of by the locals,until he gets the one up on someone who tries to sneak up on him from behind. With his rapier under the man`s chin he questions everyone as to what he could steal,and the magic beans come up. It seems Jack(billy Bob Thornton)and Jill(Amy Sedaris)have arrived in town with said magical beans. Puss thought they were just legend until he sneaks into Jack and Jills room at the hotel and sees them for himself. However there is a rival on scene,a cat dressed in a bat-like costume,also there to steal the beans. They argue and before you know it Jack and Jill are on their cases. They flee and Puss follows the rival to a bar,where the two dance fight.
After the ``fight``,the rival reveals that it is a she-cat,not a he as Puss/we first thought. This is Kitty Soft Paws(Salma Hayek),a self styled thief who has a definite knack for pocket picking. She introduces a friend to Puss,Humpty Dumpty,who is Puss`s old friend but turned enemy. Humpty wants Puss to forgive him and work with he and Kitty to restore their reps and their friendship by helping steal the magic beans. Once they have the beans they can go to the giants castle in the air,steal the Golden Goose,and pay back the town for their past misdeeds.
Puss walks out,unable to trust Humpty at all. It is at this point we get a back story to Humpty and Puss`s animosity. Both grew up in an orphanage in town and became fast friends. Humpty would think of schemes and have inventive ideas which Puss always played along with. As they grew older Humpty`s schemes were getting the pair in trouble more often than not. When Humpty raided the San Ricardo bank,Puss had had enough. With the law on their tail they fled,but their wagon loaded with loot,cascaded over a bridge and down into a river far below. Puss escaped but Humpty was left behind and caught and thrown in prison.
Puss,after persuasion from Kitty,eventually relents and agrees to help the pair retrieve the beans. Jack and Jill are heading out of town through the desert and it is here,Humpty has reasoned, would be the best place to rob the pair of their valuable cargo. A long but dangerous chase ensues with the beans exchanging hands constantly until the trio finally have their treasure. They follow Humpty`s directions and stop to plant the beans in a spot,which they are certain to grow in. A dark cloud comes over and pours down water on the beans. Only a small sprout pops up,but a few seconds go by and boom,the stalk grows and rises up and up,until it eventually reaches the clouds. The trio play for a short time in the clouds,during which their voices sound like chipmunks. When they get into the castle the air pressure changes and their voices return to normal. They find the goose,a not much bigger than them chick. It is laying eggs they can barely pick up. They grab it and return home.
While celebrating their victory Puss is knocked out by Jack. When he comes to and walks into town Puss finds Humpty and others laughing at Puss. It seems Jack and Jill,Kitty and Humpty himself,were all in on a con to sucker Puss back into town so he could be arrested. Humpty becomes a hero and Puss is taken to the slammer. In jail Puss meets up with Jack,of Jack and the Beanstalk fame. Now old,he warns Puss that Humpty doesn`t have THE goose,but its offspring and the real Golden Goose,its mother,will be back looking for her baby. And in fact this is what happens as the big bird appears,roaming through the town. Kitty helps Jack and Puss escape and she and Puss help to return the Gooses`s gosling to its mum. In the struggle though Humpty gets taken up by the Golden Goose into the clouds along with her chick. Puss is returned as a hero to the townsfolk,but someone forgot to inform the law as they still pursue him. And Puss and Kitty...well,you`ll have to watch for yourself.
This film is just a wonderful movie from start to finish. There are few slow spots at all and the story is highly inventive. You will find yourself laughing at all the twists and turns this story takes,especially where the fairy tale folks are concerned.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 1:78:1 a/r. Extras include deleted scenes,a featurette on the actors who did the voices and trailers.
All in all a puurfect addition to your family movie library,and if you own the Shrek franchise like I do,it is also a perfect addition to that. However,don`t think you will have needed to have seen a Shrek movie,as this film firmly stands on its own two feet,er paws! Great fum the whole family can watch.

4415850,2,B004LWZW7Y,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*

Maybe a kind soul can tell us what is so funny about this movie? We just don't get it and to be honest, we are probably some of the silliest, most easily entertained people you will meet! lol and I know people will say, ""you're over analyzing a silly movie"" I'm sure we are lol but it just doesn't make sense to us at all. Tonight a friend and I watched Puss in Boots because we've heard it was cute and it was on On-Demand for free. We both thought we would enjoy it because we enjoyed all the other Shrek movies. It started off ok but quickly devolved into innuendos, which I guess are the norm with children's movies now, but they included insinuations as to prison rape, sleeping around, suicide, and incest. Let us not forget that revenge was a dominating factor in this plot. (Not exactly great topics for kids, I don't think). Although most of it will go over the child's head, I still wouldn't let them watch this movie. They've warped some classic tales and by doing that it's kind of like they are promoting these things (at least to us anyway). It was very strange for a kids movie, if it were an adult cartoon type movie, I'd understand but a lot of the subplots/topics were very adult for a PG film. By the end of the movie, there were just some things didn't understand.

1. Why were Puss & Humpty the only non-humans in the orphanage?
2. Why did Jack want to start a family with Jill when they are brother & sister?
3. Why were people working for Humpty, when he got out of prison, if he didn't have any money?
4. Why was the goose, from the beanstalk, a baby when it was an adult goose in original tale?
5. Why did Jack, from the beanstalk who was a boy when he traded for the beans, look to be in his 60's when he said he only got 8-10 years in prison?
6. Why when Humpty let go of the rope, to save the baby goose, did he crack open on a rock and and become a golden egg? and why did the mother goose pick him up and take him with her when she left with her baby?",1347062400,6,2002,4.130769230769231

Check out the classic ""Mickey & The Beanstalk.""

The premise of going into the land of Jack and the Beanstalk is strange for Puss. But the idea was done by Disney in the 1940's. Dreamworks is running out of great Disney films to ""borrow"".

Shrek, Dreamworks' only successful animated movie is blatant thievery, stealing characters made icons by Disney.

Meanwhile Disney/Pixar continues to crank out classic animated features year after year.

4415904,4,B004LWZW7Y,"I loved Puss in the Shrek films so I was anxious to see this, and I was not disappointed!  As much as Donkey is a great comedy foil for Shrek, a feature-length movie featuring Donkey (even including other Shrek characters) would be quite over-the-top.  Not so with Puss.

Kids can enjoy this on a totally different level than adults who will catch on to the secondary (subtle?) innuendos.  The choice of Humpty-Dumpty as a character was surprising; it worked much better than I expected (and in retrospect, I'm very grateful a rodent was NOT chosen as the antagonist LOL).

It's definitely a movie that can be enjoyed more than once and has a catchy soundtrack as well.",1343347200,,669,4.683760683760684

4416026,4,B004LWZW7Y,"Usually, when you get a 5th sequel to a movie, you know the Studio is just cashing in as quickly as possible. Yet, the Shrek series has continued to turn out strong, witty movies. Puss in Boots even succeeds in taking the franchise beyond Shrek and the Ogres, focusing on fan favorite Puss in Boots. As a film, Puss in Boots is distinct from the Shrek films, but keeps the same lovable wit and spoofs on classic fairy tales.

The plot of Puss in Boots involves everybody's favorite cat joining Humpty Dumpty in a quest to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill. It works by and large. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments. Two things prevent me from giving it a fifth star. First, the scriptwriters opted to go for a ""conspiracy  theory"" ending. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it, but it doesn't seem to follow from the rest of the movie. Second, I thought Puss' love interest was a bit too typical. She's a strong female cat who plays coy with Puss and seems like any number of female love interests from action movies nowadays..

Overall, I'm glad to see the Shrek franchise alive and well. Puss in Boots is fun for both kids and adults.",1343347200,,1156,4.367441860465116

The character of Puss In Boots was a consistent scene stealer in the Shrek films, so it was natural to give him the spotlight.  I'm glad director Chris Miller and his screenwriters (William Davies, Brian Lynch, and Tom Wheeler) crafted a film that was worthy of him.  It continues the Shrek tradition of mashing fairy tales together while turning them on their heads, producing memorable characters and lots of funny moments.  Much of the comedy is drawn from Puss's Latin lover personality and lampooning actual feline behavior.  Very funny and cute.",1343260800,,891,5.034013605442177

It even has it's ""laugh out loud moments"". And unlike its parent Shrek movies, this movie is all action and comedy. Never a dull moment. It is definitely entertaining and good for laughs with the whole family. The movie takes place in a latin setting (Puss seems to be from Spain (Antonio Banderas definitely is) so if you know a bit of Spanish, it will make it even funnier. I enjoyed watching Puss's whole story since he was a kitten. And if you are a ""cat lover"", you will be in heaven! This is a must buy for you.

The chemistry between Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek seeps through their animated characters making it fun to watch. Not to mention that Zach Galifianakis is in it too. And being from Dreamworks, it ensures high quality in video and audio(1080p/7.1 Dolby)

4416033,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I'm in the group that isn't ashamed to say that they loved and still love `Shrek'.  Our faction is dying off and is being replaced by a growing group of individuals that refuse to admit they were initially smitten and instead insist on claiming the film to be a saccharine mess with no redeemable value and worthy of nothing but scorn.  Seriously, if you do not know of the existence of this group then please visit any film discussion forum and you will find thousands of them.  Saying all of this; I am also not afraid to point out that after the initial moment of animated bliss, this franchise has nosedived.  The second `Shrek' was a bore, the third a minor upstep and then that fourth was a total abomination.

I was skeptical about Puss getting his own gig.

Thankfully, this film is a complete treasure.  Think what you will and balk all you want, but `Puss in Boots' is actually better than `Shrek' ever was because it has more grounded focus, better jokes (that are less pop culture heavy and more solidified in their own origins) and crisper animation.  Also, I love the way that the film isn't afraid of creating a villain that isn't completely wicked.  I have a pet peeve with children's films that center on the epitome of cruel.  I mean, I love `Toy Story 3' as much as the next guy, but did Lotso really have to be that wicked, so wicked as to attempt to murder the toys that just saved his life?  So, I was very pleased to see a redemption take place here that made the film feel more kid friendly.

Yes, the names Puss and Soft Balls are an obvious crude humor joke directed at the adults in the room, but I let that one slide.

Seriously, this one is SO good.  Any fan of animation, fairy tales, the cast or the original `Shrek' will eat this up.  Antonio should stick to cartoons, and Mr. Galifianakis is on a roll!  The plot, which incorporates Jack and Jill as well as Jack and the Beanstalk is clever, witty and comes full circle, and the big reveal sequence concerning Humpty Dumpty (complete with slow motion flashback) was spot on perfection and left me in complete stitches.  HIS FACE!!!!

We can tolerate it because this movie is legitimately very good. Plot, voicing, animation, jokes - it's all there. This is definitely one of the better children's movies to come out in the last ten years.

As a bonus, the extra features on the disc(s) are pretty cool too. The 'new adventure' is an animated short featuring Puss, with Antonio Banderes reprising his role as the voice of Puss.  The quality of the short is nowhere near the quality of the movie itself, but it's a fun little extra on par with a saturday morning cartoon. The rest of the features include the usual commentaries & such, deleted scenes (storyboarded, not fully animated), actor interviews, and a couple of neat interactive features like a keyboard that plays nursery rhymes while the main characters dance. While the audience for some of these special features is probably somewhat limited, there is a lot of material here. The bit on the cat-thief in California is actually from an Animal Planet show, and quite amusing.

Anyway, give this movie a watch. It's worth it.  The 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD triple-pack is a good value as well, thanks to the extra features and the multiple disc copies.",1339718400,2,1375,4.6652892561983474

I absolutely adore this movie.  It is great for both adults and kids.  One does not have to be a cat lover to fall in love with this kitty cat character so adorably played by Antonio Banderas.  In the story, Puss meets his match.  Her name is Kitty Puff and she is a female Zoro (played by Salma Hayek).  This animated film is very original.  It has wonderful moments such as Puss in the bar when he orders a shot of ""leche"". The way he drinks it will drive you mad!  Not to mention dancing duel between Puss and Kitty when she pulls a ""kitty litter"" dance move on him. I loved this film from start to finish.  It is one of the best animated movies ever.

I still cannot get it out of my head when Antonio Banderas at the end of the movie says how Puss is a 'great, great lover"" and ""seducer of beautiful women"".  With his hard rolling ""r""s and spanish accent, this figure of speach will be a kind of thing that will make you smile every time you think of it.  Enjoy!",1338681600,,1211,4.102127659574468

4416284,5,B004LWZW7Y,"Here's another funny cartoon from DreamWorks, along the same lines as their others such as ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar,"" ""Kung Fu Panda"", etc. By now you probably now what to expect - lots of funny dialog, goofy antics from anthropomorphic animals, and a basic lesson to be learned. The title character Puss in Boots is of course from the Shrek movies. They flesh out his character and history more here and add others such as Humpty Dumpty, the ex-best friend, and Kitty Softpaws, a female romantic interest for Puss.

Puss, Humpty, and Kitty conspire to steal magic beans so they can grow the beanstalk and take the goose that lays golden eggs. Puss is doing it so he can right a wrong - he wants to pay back the town which he unintentionally betrayed. Humpty has seemingly been obsessed with finding the magic beans since he was very young, and he's brought Kitty along as a master thief. Puss was best friends with Humpty years ago until Humpty betrayed him, so he enters into this new alliance somewhat uneasily.

In addition to the movie, the discs include a new short film featuring Puss. It's less than half an hour long but extremely funny. Puss ends up with three kittens to oversee and they're a lot more trouble than they look. Much like the movie itself, there were many little details that, as a cat owner, I especially found humor in because the behavior is so like a real cat.

4416339,5,B004LWZW7Y,"I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, watching Puss in Boots without Shrek and all the rest of the cast. Especially considering I am a dog person. It probably helps that Puss is cute and animated and doesn't scratch up my furniture! This was a really cute movie and I laughed a lot. Humpty Alexander Dumpty... now he was an interesting addition. Sometimes I was annoyed by him and then other times I was totally amused. He was especially funny when he thought he blended in with the goose's golden eggs when he zipped himself up into his golden suit. And Kitty Soft-Paws was a pretty good foe/friend for Puss. The only problem with these ""prequels"" is that they add these really nice love interests that we like, but they appear nowhere in the entire Shrek saga! Puss was always the only main character who stayed single. Hmmm... maybe this is why!

Highly recommended. I wonder what's next. ""Donkey's Story""? That should be fun!",1336694400,,939,4.622754491017964

His friends Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty are hilarious, as are Jack and Jill, the goose that lays golden eggs (actually a cute little gosling), and really all the characters and situations. But the most important reason is the incredibly multi-layered sense of humor this film displays. Inside jokes for cat lovers, double entendres galore, visual humor that makes you want to watch it a second time just to appreciate all the subtleties, and terrific animation.

Dreamworks shows us how animation should be done. I swear I love them even more than I did Disney when I was a child. Be prepared to ROFLYAO.",1336608000,,783,4.757352941176471

I remember being drug to this movie in theaters when my girlfriend wanted to see it. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. Dreamworks definitely put more work into it then I thought they would have for a Shrek spinnoff. In fact it doesn't feel like a spinoff at all, but an entirely separate movie and that, I'm sure, is exactly how they wanted it to feel.

The bonus movie, 'The Three Diablos"" is interesting, but not as good as the main feature. It's just over 13 minutes and introduces three new characters, the Diablos who are basically the 3D animators attempt to make irresistibly cute cats. They're pretty cute visually, but the voice acting (just meows) for those three characters are pretty lackluster. Kind of makes them a bit annoying.",1334966400,,870,4.686274509803922

So I saw the DVD of his movie being sold, and, having not seen it in the theatres, I decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because it's an entertaining funny film.
But when comparing it to Shrek, it kind of looks much worse than it does on its own. There were several parts of the movie that just weren't interesting. However, there is one highlight in the movie, involving one of the new principal characters:
Kitty Softpaws. She's the love interest in this movie, and she is fantastic! Her character is so smart and sassy that every girl admires her, and my favourite parts of the movie by far are the times she takes Puss' stuff: His boots, his money, his hat...it's just funny to watch her take all this stuff without him even noticing.
The story is OK, but nothing special. Maybe there are a few twists, and the end is good, but in my opinion, it's hard not to switch the movie off right in the middle.

`Puss In Boots' is a great film for many reasons. It is a great origin story about this character and I was very impressed that they did not give you any hits or leeway towards any of the Shrek Films. The cast (minus Zach Galifanakis for me at least) was great. Selma Hayak and Antonio Banderas have always had great on screen chemistry, just watch `Desperado'. Lending their voices to this film they still have that great chemistry that just makes you enjoy their work from beginning to end. Also, while there are no hints to Shrek in this film there are just traditional pop culture references and one of a kind jokes that made the Shrek universe a fun place to be and `Puss In Boots' gives that you as well. There are some parts in this film that will make you laugh so hard and parts that will make you laugh even harder.

Reluctantly Puss joins forces in an effort to steal 3 magical beans that when properly planted will grow a giant bean stalk up to the sky.  There, they will find the goose that lays golden eggs.

Once recovered, they can repay the town and get the law off their tale.  Not to mention, they would be rich.  Well, rich until the overabundance of gold eggs screws up the economic system with hyper inflation.  This film looks and sounds great.  The Blu ray is magnificent in every way.  Unfortunately, the usual salting of inside jokes for the grown-ups is missing for the most part.  The funniest bits are when the felines do their kitty tricks.  You know, the big sad eyes to counter the more ferocious image.

4416836,4,B004LWZW7Y,"A spin-off from ""Shrek"" series, ""Puss in Boots"" provides a surprisingly entertaining romp. But Oscar contender? I don't know, though I really enjoyed watching the film. Anyway, directed by Chris Miller (""Shrek the Third""), the light-hearted adventure movie succeeds by not taking itself too seriously, just like the titular sword-wielding cat sporting a plumed hat.

The new DreamWorks animation follows the story of Puss in Boots (voice by Antonio Banderas) before meeting Shrek and his friends. After his plan to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill is sabotaged by a mysterious thief, the outlaw cat encounters his childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (voice by Zach Galifianakis). The storyline, inspired by such famous fables, folklores and fairy tales as ""The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs"" and ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is predictable but good enough for rollicking adventures including the joyful ""dance fight"" sequence.

The screenwriter team wisely avoided pop culture references that would be tiresome in this new chapter. A new female character Kitty Softpaws, a master pickpocket (voice by Banderas's ""Desperado"" co-star Salma Hayek) appears, but the ""Puss in Boots"" is light on romance and heavy on action set-pieces. Those who prefer the quirky touch of ""Rango"" will find the characters and storytelling too conventional, but ""Puss in Boots"" remains enjoyable nonetheless.

As far as story and visuals go, ""Puss in Boots"" breaks no new ground, with familiar storyline and action sequences, but it still manages to be entertaining throughout.",1333411200,,1551,5.400826446280992

4416839,5,B004LWZW7Y,"""Puss in Boots"" is a wild and wonderful romp through Fairy Tale land. Puss must clear his past in his old town after a falling out with an ex-friend named Humpty Dumpty. When he encounters Kitty Softpaws, he finds she is his equal both in dancing and in other skills. He also finds his ex-friend is seeking his help in obtaining the Key to reaching the Golden Goose from two nefarious characters, Jack and Jill, who live in a wagon driven by wild boars. When they do get the key,they find the Golden Goose, but unleash a monster that threatens the town where Puss grows up.

In fact, without Selma Hayek, this film wouldn't have sold half of what it has.  The story is about Humpty Dumpty meeting up with Puss, and Humpty Dumpty just happens to have a close friend named Kitty Soft Paws.  They are seeking the magic beans that grow the beanstalk all the way up to the cloud castle where the goose is that lays the golden eggs.  If I'm spoiling this film for you, then you just might be shallow enough to enjoy it.  There are SOME short parts that are good, and the film ends well for everybody, but it just isn't the caliber of the Shrek films.  This isn't a prequel to Shrek, and it isn't a spin-off.  It is a story all its own that HAPPENS to include the character Puss In Boots, almost LIKE the character in Shrek.  They might as well have made it a completely different character and used somebody else besides Antonio Banderas.  This film ""Puss In Boots,"" is geared to elementary age marketing, and should not be assumed to have the same appeal to adults that ""Shrek"" has.  I wanted to watch it, I did, and there's no reason for me to watch it again.

Together, the two youths fall into trouble, but it seems that Humpty will never be able to shake that life.  Fast forward a number of years, and Humpty runs into Puss again.  This time he's got the ultimate scheme, to steal the Golden Goose from the Giant (of Jack and the Beanstalk).  Humpty convinces Puss to sign on to the idea, and the two go after the Golden Goose.

This is your typical Dreamworks film.  The cinematography is stunning, the landscapes never better.  The humor is very strong, although there are a couple lines that (in my opinion) are a little too crude for children 6 and under.  The puns are great, and the movie is laced with them.  The only thing that I felt it was missing was how Puss got linked up with Shrek.  All-in-all, though, this was a very good film.",1332288000,,937,4.3895348837209305

What i liked the most about it, is that it appeals for both adults and young ones, it was executed in a very professional manner, and was balanced just right to be suitable for both the old and the young.

the movie is basically a tale of Puss' start, how he came to be, and the story behind his character, adding to it lots of action and adventure, and the movie never drags, with the right amount of pace.

new loveable characters were added here, Kitty voiced by the charming Salma Hayek was an attractive and interesting love interest for Puss, but she is not your regular female cat as she has some very exceptional skills as well, think a Bond type if girl.

Visually, it was spectacular, everthing was done so perfectly it appears so real, one of the best visually imoressive CGI films i have seen, the texture, the colors and characters, all done so professionaly, Bravo to the animators and people behind it.

A friend/nemesis from his past (Humpty-Dumpty) re-enters his life, along with a new romantic interest played by Selma Hayak, and they attempt to steal a goose that lays golden eggs. Like Shrek, it's full of fairy-tale references and 'inside' jokes that play more to adults than kids, although kids love the action. I didn't find it quite as funny as the Shrek movies though - maybe because there's no Eddie Murphy/donkey sidekick to lighten things up.

The gosling laying huge gold eggs in massive numbers besides seeming weird would certainly be a neat biological trick for a baby goose. Add all that high density gold and you have a golden egg laying goose that didn't visually make sense. Also,
ho-hum predictable was the stereotyped feline love interest. Character voice choices were OK but then they are well practiced at that by now.

While the franchised was loved till the very end, Shreks recent outings have been more of an after thought. Sloppier and genrally less fun than Shreks 1 & 2, the final two weren't bad by any means, just a tad redunt. Luckily the studio realized this, as well as the fact that there was two foot four gold mine starring in their second Shrek title, so they gave him his own well deserved film.
What we're left with is the greatness that is Puss in Boots, a movie about one of the series most iconic characters, yet only garnered minimum time on the big screen in the shadows of Shrek and Donkey, especially in the latter two films. Rest easy, the big green lug and his noble steed are nowhere to be seen in this film. The film benifits from this, as you need no previous Shrek knowledge to understand Puss, which is a good thing.
Finally, as for the actual film, its undeniably well excuted. Who've thought that the studio originally had this film planned as another direct-to-video spin off when the final product is this good? They simply put alot of effort into it, and it shows with its dazzling visuals and surprising deep and implemented characters and somewhat emotional plot. When its all said and done, I really couldn't find anything noticably wrong or flawed in it, which is hard for me to do. One could make the arguement that its just another cash-in on the Shrek franchise by giving us more time with one of favorite cats, but when the movie is this good, its hard to argue.

Generally there are elements to appeal to both kids and adults, not so much this time. The dance scenes were random and all of the plot points involving lies, deceit, and more lies, turned me off.

It was just ok. I'm sure young kids will enjoy it. My 13-year-old boy felt it was fine, but I doubt he will reach for it again anytime soon.",1331164800,,473,4.314606741573034

At the end of the movie, everybody was clapping and happy about the whole movie experience....so I don't know whats up with this ""PIPS"" that has negative reviews....But you know what I only see a few reasons why which is 1)small screen tv...reason why they can't see the incredible details in the movie; 2)inferior home theater system hence very poor sound quality (its such a waste! you guys are losing a lot); 3) lost sense of humor, probably you guys have lost the inner child in you...If you guys didn't fall on those 3 reasons then....there's really something wrong with you...and c'mon, almost 50 people watched this movie with me and ENJOYED it so you can't beat that!!!",1331164800,2,952,4.846625766871166

I felt the sword play wasn't appropriate for younger children, the story line was silly and contrived, and overall a waste.

Some of the so called Fairy Tales, like Jack and the Bean Stalk, do contain violence, or are at least a bit scary. But to make a silly movie, and try to pull all sorts of stories together was a waste of talent.

I'm sure some will like it - my advice is to stream it first, before buying to watch multiple times. I for one will probably never watch it again. Sorry I didn't take my own advice, and 'preview' it first.",1331078400,3,712,4.227941176470588

Most everything about it was enjoyable, but I missed the manic cleverness that the original SHREK offered, so I wasn't really blown away. Little kids will enjoy it a lot. The original made viewers of all ages pay close attention to the brilliance that was happening in front of them. This one is a pleasant romp, though less clever and focused.

4417248,3,B004LWZW7Y,"The first thing that struck me is the many references to Puss being a great lover and hints of him sleeping around. Kind of odd for what I thought was a family movie. Must be trying to appeal to the adults, but there must have been better ways.

That's a shame, because the rest is quite entertaining, especially how the movie makes fun of Puss himself - chasing reflected light, lapping up his leche, etc.

It's a story about friendship, disappointment, and redemption, with some scary villains (Jack and Jill). It's also genuinely touching.

Some of the sequences (such as the dance-off) could have been much shorter, but that's a quibble. The plot and characters, especially Humpty's motivations, once revealed, turn out to be a bit more complex than you might expect, too, with adult themes (Jill is pressuring Jack to have a baby, for example; a character dies (or not?) in the end, and then ... what???). The golden goose looks a little demented - was that intended? Probably.

We were trying to guess who voiced Humpty. He did a great job, and it was a surprise to find out who he was, in the credits.

So, worth a watch, with the above caveats. I'd give it 3.5 stars.",1330646400,3,1175,4.576190476190476

I didn't expect PUSS IN BOOTS to be so much fun and it was a pure laugh a minute. Great animation, vivid colors, and delightful realism in places. Of course, it is hard to resist Puss when he does his wide-eyed look. Plus, Antonio Banderas Spanish accent is just wonderful as he plays the lady-charming, swashbuckling Puss in Boots.

We learn the history of Puss in Boots and that Humpty Dumpty was his best friend..like a brother..but one who betrayed him turning Puss in Boots into a WANTED but innocent criminal.
The movie is almost more for adults than for kids. This is a darker version of some beloved fairy tales. This time, Jack and Jill are a nasty criminal duo. Somehow it's this Jack that has the magic beans to grow the beanstalk to the sky. Soon it is Jack and Jill against Puss in Boots, Humpty Dumpty and the lovely Kitty Softpaws for the magic beans and the chance to steal the Golden Goose.

Puss displays a lot of attitude and Banderas has the voice down perfectly. There is also a moral tale at times here about abandoned animals and the reason Kitty has ""softpaws"".

The main supporting characters---Kitty Softpaws, Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill--are all well developed and original.  But it is Puss's movie with his flamboyant charm, his woeful doe eyes and cavalier bravado that fuels the film.  Antonio Banderas is purrfect as Puss; Salma Hayek is spot on as the perky Kitty; Zach Galiafinakis brings a sinister villainy to the conflicted Humpty and Jack and Jill are well voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris.

There are many reviews that will give you details on the movie plot, so I will leave it to them. The 3D effects are good but not over the top. The movie scenes have good depth but nothing really comes flying at you or around you, everything stays within the 3D scene. There are some cool flyover scenery parts. But the movie preview for Madagascar 3 that comes out summer 2012 has stuff flying at you.

What you wanted to know is what do you get with the 3D BD purchase? You get 2 movies:
1) Puss in Boots (3D, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy)
2) The Three Diablos (3D, Blu-ray)

There's a Chuck E Cheese coupon, Digital copy authorization code from ParamountDigitalCopy.com and a flyer for the Train Your Dragon stage tour. The authorization code took me to iTunes to redeem my code on a Mac after launching the ""Puss in Boots.dmg"" file and the file was installed into my movie library taking all of 5 minutes.

We like cartoons that are well animated and contain a great mix of action, music, and dialog... this movie hits all of those categories. I found some of the humor in Shrek (the film this movie was spawned from) to be a little borderline ""grown up""... not that it was inappropriate, but there were jokes I wouldn't want her repeating... none of that here in Puss in Boots.

It is almost like an animated version of Zorro except puss in boots is not a vigilante but a falsely accused fugitive.  The cat humor was my favorite!

Puss in Boots, therefore, was a pleasant surprise for me. Starring Antonio Banderas as the voice of the titular feline, Puss is sort of a prequel to the Shrek films, following the adventures of its swashbuckling star as he teams up with Humpty Dumpty and Kitty Softpaws to take on Jack and Jill for their magical beans. Bubbling with wry wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm, Puss in Boots helps restore some luster to the Shrek universe.

The dancing alone is enough to see this clever and funny animated movie.  Another strong point is the dynamic between Puss and Humpty Dumpty.  Their rivalry between these two best friends, brothers, and comrade-at-arms is so childish and petty that it's actually endearing.

In this movie, Zach Galifianakis shows that while he can't play real people without being annoying, he can play a bad egg pretty well.",1326412800,15,539,5.01123595505618

I was so horrendously disappointed, I can't believe the people who left these 4 & 5 star reviews were awake for this film. Puss starts life out @ a boarding school where humpty dumpty is his best friend. He then grows up going on a quest for the magic beans from the Jack & the Beanstalk story. It gets even weirder when a very neanderthalish (billy bob thorton) starts after him after he steals the magic beans. It is the biggest mess of an animated feature imaginable. Makes you wonder, what the writers/directors were on. couldn't be good pot, it would have been a much better story. Selma Hayaks character sadly didn't help this story at all.

4417552,4,B004LWZW7Y,"This movie is a fun mix of various fairy tale references and the Zorre-esque Puss In Boots character from the Shrek films.  We basically get here the origins of the Puss character and an early adventure of his.  It has the general fun and atmosphere of the Shrek movies while having its own identity - it's full of lots of humor, but with a good adventure story to keep the plot moving.
  There are several things that this movie could've totally blown but got spot-on right.  The creators made the right move in focusing on one character from the Shrek movies in his own feature, and they definitely made the right choice of characters - Puss is likeable and amusing and has enough substance to pull of the lead role.  As a music lover, I was particularly pleased with the flamenco-ish soundtrack (featuring Rodrigo & Gabriela) that added to the overal cultural flavor, as opposed to the modern pop music of Shrek.  Similarly, the ""Zorro"" similarities with the title character was matched with a Mexican setting and appropriate accents (except by the annoying  American accent of Humpty Dumpty, which dind't fit in at all, and I don't remember any explanation in the movie of why someone raised from a small child in an orphanage would not have the same accent as those he grew up around).  The movie didn't try to fit in innapropriate references to characters that didn't belong (as in, for example, ""Muppet Babies"", where a bunch of characters we'd seen meet for the first time as adults are now seen hanging out as children).  So, you won't see Shrek or Donkey, but Puss does just fine on his own (and the movie maybe flows a little better without the increasingly over-the-top slapstick of the later Shrek films).  In fact, this movie definitely has a different feel than Shrek, with a little less of a focus on mixing modern pop-culture references with a fantasy setting, although those elements are still there.
  Definitely worth watching and I hope it spawns a series of films of its own.",1323475200,19,1997,4.704022988505747

I was amazed that it turned out that the trailers didn't just show the funny parts (as seems to happen all the time these days with movies) and that the whole movie was really good. Not a boring moment in the film.

The storyline is intricate but compelling, vividly weaving together a myriad of nursery rhyme characters  into the plot, which is filled with fun and adventure. It also tells the viewer about the origins of Puss in Boots. While this historical perspective may not have much to do with the original Puss in Boots of the classic French fairy tale, somehow it all works.

This is simply a terrific animated film that is fun for the whole family.  Those who are cat lovers will particularly love this film. It is the cat's meow!",1322870400,2,788,4.567375886524823

4417558,4,B004LWZW7Y,"OVIE NOTE #10: Puss N Boots. Directed by Shrek The Third director Chris Miller, the film tells the historical take of the origins of Puss In Boots as masterfully voiced by Antonio Banderis. I must admit I was expecting the sight gags and 'inside jokes' that all the Shrek films had - but this film dragged the story and scenes a little for me.

It did have some great re-occuring gags and some sight tricks, but overall didn't have the character draw and strong story for me. Selma Heyak plays Kitty Softpaws, a very funny and extremely talented female version of Puss. Their chemistry is fun and some of the Dance choreography between both their fighting snd the dancing was quite fun and hysterical. Humpty Dumpty (Voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is the 'crux' of the story and as such isn't as dynamic as Puss and Kitty. However Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris play the irreverant and oddest couple of all - Jack and Jill. They are hysterical.

The adventure is fun and once the quest gets moving - the film begins momentum. However, the ending was somewhat of a short one for me...a nice little nod to the Shrek world would have been nice, but I can see where there might be a sequal. Overall a fun family film - just not ahead of the crowd in terms of the animation films out there. Meow!",1321747200,,1292,4.470338983050848
4417559,4,B004LWZW7Y,"After the dismal Shrek the Third and the better but not-so-good Shrek Forever After, the box office returns for the franchise were at a series low and needed new blood. In being a prequel, Puss in Boots was walking a fine line. It could have been an origin story, at the risk of going through the motions, or it could have had nothing to do with the history of the character, at the risk of feeling pointless. Fortunately, this movie manages to strike the right balance and breathes new life into Dreamwork's Shrek world.

When Puss (Antonio Banderas) finds out that outlaws Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) have magic beans that can take them to the giant's castle, he ends up reuniting with Humpty Alexander Dumpy (Zach Galifianakis) and meeting Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and together they set out to stop the villains.

The best thing about Puss in Boots is its three leads. Banderas, Galifianakis and Hayek are a fun trio, especially because of the cats and egg's shared history. We learn the story of Puss and Humpty's childhood, and how Puss became the swashbuckling cat he is. Their origin is the driving force for them throughout the movie. It really takes me back to the first two Shrek movies.

Puss in Boots reminded me of how much I enjoyed Shrek 1 and 2, and in that I can can't help but compare it to them. This movie is funny as well as heartfelt, but not as much as the Shreks. There are certainly less memorable moments. The plot it also quite predictable, a family movie story that you can guess from the beginning.

The first part of the movie fleshes out the three main characters, gets them to work as a team, and the final act builds on what we've learned. But the middle, the actual beanstalk adventure, feels underwhelming and short. Sure, the accelerated growth of the beanstalk, with the characters hurtling up toward the sky, was cool. But more could have been done with the castle, and the journey through it is disappointing. Also...Humpty spent a lot of time dressed in a useless golden suit. It was weird.

Jack and Jill are also distractingly lackluster; they have about one villainous scene before their conversations are all about raising children. It's funny at first, but consumes the characters, and they never really do a whole lot. I wouldn't even be mentioning this if they weren't the main villains.

Puss has proven that he can lead his own movie, and his two companions prove to be entertaining foils. The movie misses a few beats, for sure, but it's also really fun and made me like the Shrek universe once more. Definitely a hit for Dreamworks.

4417560,4,B004LWZW7Y,"Thankfully this prequel to the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots, is better than the last couple of movies featuring that green ogre. It avoids all the pop culture references and introduces a brand new story with some interesting characters. The voice work from Antonio Banderas as Puss is outstanding and Zack Galifianakis fits in nicely as the voice of Humpy Dumpty. The movie is beautiful to look at and some of the jokes are really funny, but the story did lack in content. I thought a whole movie based on a sidekick character would get annoying really fast, but Puss has a way of turning a dog lover into a closeted cat person.",1321228800,6,630,4.584070796460177
4417561,4,B004LWZW7Y,"- Jill, dangling Puss in Boots in the air: ""Is it true that cats always land on their feet?""
- Puss in Boots: ""No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!""

He is sometimes known as ""El Diablo Gato"" or ""Furry Lover"" or even ""Chupacabra."" But legend will call him ""Puss... in Boots!"" Those wondering how this spinoff movie will work out can rest easy. PUSS IN BOOTS isn't as emotionally rich, won't resonate as deeply as recent animated classics like the TOY STORY franchise or FINDING NEMO or even UP. But it is humongously diverting. It showcases Antonio Banderas in fine voice and at his most playful. And the script knows better than to engage in dropping tired pop culture references. You'll run across a few more familiar - okay, maybe tweaked - figures from them classic nursery rhymes.

The story regales us with a tale of derring-do from Puss in Boots' past, before he met Shrek. An extended flashback sequence reveals Puss's origins, that as a kitty he was found at the doorstep of an orphanage in the dusty, sun-baked village of San Ricardo. There, he meets the bullied egg-child Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Their friendship and Humpty's obsession with finding the legendary magic beans provide the lynchpin of the story. The flashback also records Humpty's transitioning from good to rotten egg. Puss in Boots had always been prone to daring heroics and his glowing rep soon eats up Humpty. Eventually we witness their parting of ways. It's not on friendly terms.

There's a lot of clever sight gags in this film. My favorite would have to be the marvelous dance fight between Puss and a rival masked feline out to poach his latest score. Is it stunt casting when Salma Hayek fits her role so perfectly? She plays Kitty Softpaws, thief extraordinaire. This marks the fifth pairing up of Banderas and Hayek (after DESPERADO, FRIDA, SPY KIDS 3D: GAME OVER, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO). Recall that Puss is not only a swashbuckling adventurer, he is also a notorious great lover. When his estranged childhood chum Humpty Dumpty tries to enlist him for an audacious heist, it's Humpty's partner-in-crime, Kitty Softpaws, who convinces an amorous Puss to sign up. And the caper? It concerns stealing the magic beans from those murderous married outlaws, Jack and Jill. And then it's up the beanstalk and on to the giant's castle to nab the golden goose.

It's obvious that Banderas relishes spoofing himself. Puss in Boots is easily the most popular character in the SHREK franchise, and Banderas's charm easily carries the sword-slinging cat's solo outing, Latin machismo warring wonderfully with the innate cuteness of a cat in friggin' boots. Supporting Banderas and Hayek are some pretty solid names, Zach Galifianakis providing the voice of Humpty Dumpty, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as the felonious, southern twangy crooks Jack and Jill, and Guillermo del Toro as the village comandante.

As in the best of these ventures, there's something for the young and old. Them kids will eat up the wild antics on screen while adults will appreciate the sly humor that sails over the four-year-old's head. Case in point, when Puss is tossed in stir and the jailer finds his catnip, Puss claims that it's for his glaucoma. Ha. The computer graphics are at such an advanced level nowadays that it's almost worth mentioning only when the work comes in below par. Suffice it to say that PUSS IN BOOTS, full of good humor and grand adventure, is a visual treat. Puss in Boots is never more in his element. It may be that I'll resent his playing second or third fiddle to Shrek from this moment on.",1321228800,3,3601,4.792270531400966
