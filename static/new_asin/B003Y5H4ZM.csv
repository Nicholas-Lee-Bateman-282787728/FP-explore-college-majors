4219145,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"I watched this one with my wife...and to say we ""enjoyed it"" doesn't quite seem sufficient or even apt here.
While black women are indeed the focal point characters..there are indeed so many colors on display that all girls and boys can learn a lot or at least ask themselves some serious questions regardless of origin...

Some couldn't watch the scenes in this one in the movie theatre...it was too powerful they said, too strong,too much...but they went back after pulling themselves together.

Tyler take a bow....I don't need Hollywood to justify your place among the very best for me....but it would be nice ...around awards time.

God Bless you Sir.",1293926400,53,656,4.891891891891892
4219146,5,B003Y5H4ZM,If you love the original play you will love this movies. Tyler interacts the characters without destroying the original impact of the poetry. Each actress shines in her own right. This movie reminds us of the power within each of us is ready to be put to good use. Do not lose yourself in love. If you respect yourself you will love yourself. Don't be a victim. Be a victor.,1293580800,17,374,4.357142857142857
4219147,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"I was a little worried about how they were going to write a script from a poem into a movie, but they pulled it off. This movie was telling the story of black women, but it could have been any women in these stories.  We all have choices and not all of the choices are wise but we do have the ability to change our course in life and this movie showed this.  From domestic violence and rape to abortion, nothing was left unturned.

I would recommend this to be part of a women's study curriculum or at the least apart of sex/health education.  I am a married woman in her 40's with children and any one of those could have been me.  I highly recommend this movie for every woman, especially young women.",1289779200,39,703,4.2164179104477615
4219148,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I titled my review ""Multifaceted"" because Black women are multifaceted like diamonds.  They are beautiful and come in all colors, are strong and endure.  Some may be a little rough around the edges at first but if or when that precious gem finally shines through they are awesome.

I also loved this movie because it didn't focus on one part of the Black female culture.  It showed Black women who are successful, talented, trusting, naive, hopeful, bitter, religious, fanatic, loving, intelligent, insightful, wise, troubled and above all strong.

I truly hope that critics don't take the title literally and label it as just a movie about Black women.  The issues that the characters faced concerned all women.  Any woman, Black, White, Hispanic, etc. can see a little bit of themselves in at least one of the characters.  I saw a little of myself in at least three.

Thank you Tyler Perry for bringing this wonderful story to the big screen.",1289347200,114,976,4.86060606060606

This is not art not statement but a fantastic orgy of all negative afflictionside affecting the American black community: emotional trauma, historic and intergenerational rejection, physical and mental abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, hypersexualization, relational and spousal abuse, verbal abuse, and worst of all, normalisation of all of above.  I am sooooo disappointed and wonder how much is wrong with the director for him not to see that -propagating all of above - he is part of the problem....",1484352000,,603,5.414893617021277

The men in this film are child murders, rapist, drunkards, over-sexed cheaters or gay. The KKK could not have created such vicious stereotypes about Black men as this film does. What a tragic vile waste of resources and talent unless you are a viewing this at a KKK rally.",1483056000,,381,4.617647058823529
4219232,5,B003Y5H4ZM,Very good movie!,1482883200,,16,4.666666666666667
4219233,4,B003Y5H4ZM,"Before I saw the film, I read the underlying work Tyler Perry dramatized in his screenplay: Ntozake Shange's choreopoem ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf.""  As an adaptation of that work, I would rate this movie a 5 -- Tyler Perry, and the fabulous actresses he cast, did a fantastic job bringing Ntozake Shange's work to the screen.

That said, I completely understand the 2 and 3 star reviews who object that this movie is too dark -- that was my thought about Ntozake Shange's choreopoem when I first read it -- and in deference to their legitimate criticisms, I give the film 4 stars instead of 5.  I applaud realism -- and you cannot heal problems you refuse to look at honestly and realistically -- but, still:  it is depressing to read about/experience/watch repeated dark episodes and never be given hints about how one could go about healing and preventing the darkness for the future.

In defense of Ntozake Shange's perspective, however, she wrote ""For Colored Girls"" in the 1970's to shine a light on issues she felt were not being addressed.  She also says she wrote it with a female audience in mind. As Allan Wallach wrote in Newsday, ""In poetry and prose, Shange describes what it means to be a black woman in a world of mean streets, deceitful men, and aching loss.""  As Shange wrote in 2010, ""'For Colored Girls' was and is for colored girls.""

Many black men objected that Shange's poem cast them in too dire a light.  Here is what Shange says in an introduction written in 2010:  ""The reactions from black men to 'For Colored Girls' was in a way very much like the white reaction to black power.  The body traditionally used to power and authority interpreting, through their own fear, my work celebrating the self-determination and centrality of women as a hostile act.  For men to walk out feeling that the work was about them spoke to their own patriarchal delusions more than to the actuality of the work itself.""

But sensitive men have realized that Shange was simply bringing to light painful realities of life which need our collective attention.  She says that when she received the Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Prize for Lifetime Achievement, the poet Haki Madhubuti said to her of ""For Colored Girls"":  ""We didn't know.""  He meant, obviously, that Shange's poem was a wake up call about the plight of women of color.

Ms. Shange met with all of the actresses in this film while the last scenes were being shot.  Most of them had read her poem when they were growing up.  She reflects, ""That 'For Colored Girls' continues to resonate so profoundly almost forty years after I first set pen to paper is bittersweet for me.  Though we have achieved many a milestone, the stories and struggles of our lives as women, and in particular, women of color, are still not granted the full address due.""

So, my final thought with respect to the darkness of the stories in ""For Colored Girls"":  the real tragedy is that those dark stories continue to be re-enacted in the reality of everyday life.  If you care about reality, you should watch, and care about, this fine adaptation of Ntozake Shange's poem.",1481414400,,3158,4.712204007285974

4219544,4,B003Y5H4ZM,"I liked this movie.  Unlike many of the critics, the interspersal of script with the dialogue from the play didn't bother me.  I thought it made the film appear more 'artsy'.  And actually, if you haven't read ""For Colored Girls"", it may even be hard to discern when the characters are going into ""play/theatre mode"".  For example, it took me a while to realize that Macy Gray's character (abortionist) was in play mode; I thought she was just being lofty until I recognized the piece from the play. The movie was a real downer, but of course, how could it be otherwise? - the play was a real downer.  The casting and acting was superb.  For some of these women, I'd say it was perhaps their strongest role.  Even Kerry Washington, who's a facepiece, had a strong ensemble part in which she did quite well.  Anika Noni Rose never fails to astound as a superior actor whose Broadway roots always show.  Her transition here from a sunflower to a shrinking daisy is one of the strongest assets of the play. (You will note even her brilliance of her ""yellow"" becomes more and more somber until by the end, she's in such a muted shade that it doesnt even look yellow anymore.)  Nobody cries like Kimberly Elise! (Does anyone recall her in a movie where she did NOT cry?)  I'm not a Thandi Newton fan, but I've seen her in enough strong roles now that I have to admit that if given the correct role, she's a very good actress. Janet was just beautiful. Red becomes her. And since Whoopi was in the same outfit, you might not have even noticed that she was ""White"" if you weren't familiar with the play. The addition of Phylicia Rashad and the husbands was well done, and Tyler Perry's screenplay deserves kudos for tackling a very difficult work and making it ""work"" for the screen. ""For Colored Girls..."" is a difficult read, and equally difficult as a stage play, but Perry's screenplay did a very good job of keeping the tone and color of the choreoplay.  It brought out the stories as reflected in the choreoplay, and updated them to keep the same theme but tackle 21st century issues. The movie LOOKS good.  The whole feel of the movie actually reminds me of a play. And the color changes for the women was apt for the movie. (Although the Lady in Purple was actualy the Lady in Yellow in the choreoplay, the charcter assigned to the Lady in Purple was more ""regal"" and befitting of purple; and Anika N Rose's character in the movie was yellow and full of sunshine.) I applaud Tyler for his courage and vision in attempting this project. ""Madear"" may be his bread and butter, but Perry has proven with his ""Why Did I Get Married"" movies, and now ""For Colored Girls"" that he is capable of so much more.  Lovely, lovely movie.  (But don't get it confused; it's a serious movie, and not a comedy, or a dramedy, or anything that you might normally associate with Tyler Perry.  It's real!)",1431993600,3,2883,4.504798464491363

This was just way too much drama. Too much! I know things like this happen to women but does it have to be all in one film? I know this is based off a play but still, you gotta give the audience some breathing room. I'm tired of films about women (black women especially) always so bogged down with this negativity and abuse stuff. I'm not saying it's a bad film but for me it was just way too much to see all of this going on at one time. Yes, this stuff happens but I don't wanna see every bad thing that can happen to a woman in one film. I can't say don't watch it because someone else might like it, but if you don't wanna see such difficult subjects all wrapped up in one film then this isn't for you.

4219845,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"Ntozake Shange's Tony-nominated 1975 stage play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf was a landmark piece in African American literature and black feminism. Written, directed and produced by Tyler Perry, For Colored Girls film is cinematically beautiful and poetic but neither revolutionary nor enlightening. Tyler Perry's screenwriting is the weakest aspect of the film.

For Colored Girls is one of the better acted Tyler Perry films due to an ensemble cast which includes Janet Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Phylicia Rashad, Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, and Kerry Washington. Perry force conventional plots and cliches without souls into Shange's literary work.

Each character gets the opportunity to burst into Shange's poetic arias. But the connective filler that Perry constructed to link the various stories amounts to a introductory course in writing. The women of this film shine, hitting strong emotional notes that ring true even when Perry's script adaptation feels false.

Loretta Devine and Janet Jackson would have been better served by a stronger director. Loretta Devine delivers an earnest breathless performance that is multi-layered in that its embarassingly comical and touching.

It is impressive to see Janet Jackson showcasing a new level of her acting range that doe not rely on her trademark smile nor voice. She outdoes herself here. It's not just Jackson's short haircut and traumatized eyes its also the mix of masculine hyper-competitiveness and feminine vulnerability that has always defined Jackson, and links it to the wily, lonely coldness often captured in classic Hollywood performances.

Although this is Perry's most mature directorial work to-date but his script writing is flawed (as always). His adding (Whoopi Goldberg and Phylicia Rashad) characters to the script proves unnecessary. Goldberg's over-the-top portrayal of  Alice, a religious fanatic is distracting. Her best scene is the nuanced poetic duet with Thandi Newton. Rashad's nosey watching neighbor is one-note and one-dimensional. Her storyline never quite connects, so it often feels as if she's walked into the wrong movie.

His Janet Jackson character is storyline is not well thought out. If she is aggressive, domineering, and confrontational as written, why would she wait (until its life-threatening) to confront her husband on things that she knew about him.

Perry does not allow Kimberly Elise's Crystal to be the liberated character that she was in Shange's choreopoem, instead he renders her as a depressed and defeated drone.

Singer Macy Gray's (always delivers in her acting roles) eerie cameo as a back-alley abortionist will make anyone rethink ever having unprotected sex. Macy is one brave casting decision away from a PRECIOUS Mo'Nique moment.

Anika Noni Rose delievers a seething post-rape monologue that lands just on the right side of the films stage origins.

For Colored Girls is a tour de force for Thandie Newton as Tangie in a role that was to be Mariah Carey's. Thandie is so great that its Ms. Carey did not do the role. Thandie fiercely delivers an Oscar worthy performance of a troubled, selfish sex addict that reveals levels and range that have never been so fully displayed in any of her other roles.

Whatever stumbles there may be, they are offset by moments when For Colored Girls soars. Perry never solves the stage-to-screen translation problem. But the path he has chosen is as intriguing as it is irksome, and it works better than one might expect.",1385769600,,3563,5.309058614564831

This film was about African American women but it's not only for African American women. I think every one who watches it will be able to relate to at least one of the characters in a deep and profound way.

I usually stay away from Tyler Perry films.  I find myself just absolutely insulted by his Madea series.  I started changing my mind about him when a friend took me to see Alex Cross.  He was simply amazing in that film and I thought ""wow, this guy can actually act!"".  Then I saw For Colored Girls and I now have a respect for Mr. Perry that I have for no other filmmaker I have ever experienced aside from Spielberg. I read this book in college and it was the inspiration for my life at that time.  When I heard this was coming to film... and that Tyler Perry was doing it... I cringed.  But I need not have worried.  Mr. Perry far surpassed my expectations and brought this book to life in a way that renewed its message for me.  Bravo to you, Mr. Perry.  Bravo.

Now, on to the cast.  How these group of women did not win, or were not even nominated for an Oscar, is simply baffling.  Each one of these amazing actresses put their entire being on display here.  Their heart and souls were laid bare on the screen for us.  This was acting at its finest.  How in the world did this film get ignored at Oscar time???  How did these actresses get ignored at Oscar time?!?!? This is why I have absolutely no respect the Academy Awards.  It's not recognizing the best actors/actresses, but celebrating top money-makers.  If the Oscar really went to the person who gave the most outstanding performance in a motion picture then one of these ladies would have surely taken it home.  It's just criminal that they were ignored by the Academy. Not even a nomination.  Tisk tisk tisk, Academy.  I can't say enough good things about this film.  It is easily one of my top 3 films of all time.",1369526400,3,2004,4.32258064516129

It seemed like each actress was trying to outdo the other with thier monologues and it it got to a point where it turned into sheer ridiculousness. There were too many monologues and they weren't your average monologue where you could easily comprehend what an actor was tying to say. These were very poetic and long and because of the effort that was spent trying to figure them out, I simply gave up. It wasn't worth it to me. The other issue I had is that it seemed each characters tragedy was trying to
Outdo the others. I am a black woman, yes I've seen plenty if tragedy, but I can't stand it when all black casts get together and relay a message to the general population that portrays us a certain way. This film could have been better with a bit of brightness to it. There was way too much tragedy and sorrrow mixed with puffed up monologues. If it wasn't for the cast I would have given no stars.

Every one of the characters that opened their mouth to speak, spoke like they were on a stage (at a talent show) quoting poetry.  As a person who is really not into poetry, I found it difficult to follow....it made me feel like I was watching a movie in another language because I had to try to decode what they were saying.

4220106,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"Before watching this beautiful movie, I had previously read the play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf"" (often referred to by its abbreviated title For Colored Girls) several times. I was first introduced to the playwrite and her works by my then theatre director and I immediately fell in love with the style and message of Ntozake Shange. Then Tyle Perry who is famous for his serio-comedies as Madea directed and produced the film adaptation of this beautiful play.

Admittedly when the trailers first began to air,  I was skeptical. But what a star-studded cast! And come on - this was an ethnic  movie that was actually going to show in the big cinema in town and wasn't going straight to DVD! How could I miss that?

And Tyler Perry's ""For Colored Girls"" really delivered. Of course, it diverges a bit from the original play, but Perry beautifully adapts the piece to fit the circumstances and complexities we face today. And the cast spectacularly gives Shange's characters new life on the big screen (or your little screen at home or on the go). It is a wonderfully dramatic and inspiring film that, despite its title, is not just ""for colored girls"" but for everyone searching for a little extra humanity in their next movie night.",1360713600,,1278,4.795454545454546

4220213,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"I must start off saying, kudos to Tyler Perry for putting together such a fantastic movie.  I got watch this movie finally and my heart broke for all the characters involved in this movie.  The mixture of screenplay along with the poetry from the actual book made this movie a worthwhile to watch.  While the stories are sad and depressing -- it doesn't shy away that this is what is going on with not just colored women -- but all women who have experienced alot of these lives.  Most of us can all agree, Kimberly Elise should had at least got an Oscar mention for this film (but we know how they work over at the Academy).  Janet Jackson hasn't had many movie roles in her lifetime yet when she does she's really good at it.  Whoopi Goldberg pulls off a somewhat of a modern-day version Celie, which I liked.  As for the rest of the cast they all do fine job portraying each character.  Tyler Perry's directing is also improving with every picture, which says alot about his talents overall in the world of entertainment.  In the end, For Colored Girls shouldn't be taken as it's only for women of color -- all individuals should watch this movie and watch these stories with a clear mind and openness to these characters.  Simply a great movie.",1346976000,2,1248,4.482300884955753
4220214,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"This is a look at the lives of 9 different Black women who live in the same community in a big city.  At first the story switches between the stories of the different women, but as the movie progresses these lives intersect and interact more and more often.  1. Whoopi Goldberg plays a woman who is involved in some kind of religious cult.  2, 3. Her two daughters are like night and day.  One is known for having lots of sexual encounters with men, the other is a perfect straight-A student who is college-bound.  4.  The straight-A student's teacher is another character.  5. Loretta Devine runs her own free clinic, while I think working nights in the hospital.  6. Janet Jackson plays the owner of a top fashion magazine who is fabulously wealthy.  7.  Another woman is her assistant.  8. Another character is a social worker.  9.  Phylicia Rashad is the landlady of the apartment building where several of the characters live.

The movie considers rape, murder, suicide, affairs, class differences, abortion: a laundry list of humanity's horrors.  I found the plot of the movie to be dark and dismal, but it was important for the sake of this movie that it be so.  In the face of all of society's and life's tragedies, Black women must keep living, keep experiencing.  It reminded me of the violence that many, many women face just for being a woman.  It reminded me of the importance of always treating people with decency, warmth, and kindness because you really don't know who faces abuse when they go home everyday.

One more thing, there is a normal movie atmosphere for much of the movie, but every 10 minutes or so one of the characters will enter into an extended poetic monologue.  I found these moments to be beautiful and poignant.  It was very different to see that in a movie; I can't think of another movie with this kind of style.

4220256,3,B003Y5H4ZM,"This movie is a gripping taste of some of the hardships that go on in the black community. It's a sad movie, all around.  If you're looking for a ray of sunlight, you'll be hardpressed to find one in this movie.  You'll have to prepare yourself to see things that you don't want to recognize as fact. One thing that can be appreciated is the use of colorful poetry as dialogue.  The mix is pretty phenomenal- from an artistic view, however- it can be distracting if you're trying to catch every word of the dialogue.  I had to watch it several times to appreciate the detail of how things were orchestrated.  Tyler Perry did an amazing job on this movie.

  The thing that was the most distracting, had nothing to do w/the actual movie.  It was the DVD that bothered me the most.  The quality was horrible.  I will no longer be purchasing DVDs from the dealer I used.  I'll have to find the one, to be sure- but I've gotten a couple of DVDs from them. For starters, the case has the name ""Mariah"" on the front.  For someone who is such an avid Amazon seller, she should probably know not to put her name on the front of the cases in black sharpie marker.  Then, the cd itself skipped so many times, that I had to clean it about 4 times before I could finish the movie.  When I looked at the DVD- it was scratched all over.  I'm disappointed in the quality of the dvd I received- but it had no baring on the quality of work Tyler Perry did in this production.",1344902400,2,1458,4.228260869565218
4220257,3,B003Y5H4ZM,"This movie, based on a play with a similar name, which I saw in the 80s, appeared on TV last night. This updated more modern version (for all of the obvious reasons, it keeps being resurrected), has slickly trimmed away some of the rough edges and returned with a flourish into a new repackaged reincarnated ""Oprah-Tyler Perry like"" genre. Essentially it is an intra-tribal intra-gender conversation among black women about ""the problem?"" (Remember the problem? -- as it was discussed in: ""What's Love Got to do with it?,"" Waiting to Exhale,"" Color Purple,"" and ""Precious?"" to name just the most obvious ones?).

My assessment of them is that by constantly harping on the same exaggerated but disingenuous theme (to the exclusion of all others): that it is black men's irresponsibility that is responsible for all of the woes of black women, altogether constitutes a kind of emotional blackmail within the black tribe. It does this by introducing a crippling threat of a fifth rail or a fifth column into the ""black-on-black internecine warfare"" in our already sick racist world. Only this time, the war crimes are ""thought crimes"" being committed by black women -- first against their intended target, us, black men, but then also against the larger and unintended targets of the black race as a whole, as well as the unmistakable and unavoidable boomerang effects that rebound back to black women themselves?

In barely disguised form, this movie, as an integral part of the new Oprah-Tyler Perry inspired genre, appears as little more than another theater of the emotionally hysterical, a revisited sick and absurd anti-black male trope. As such, it amounts to yet another form of the intentional ""emotional"" and continued criminal profiling of, and attempted destruction of, black men's characters,"" sold as the new black woman propaganda. But this time the attack is occurring from within the black family itself. And in this sense, tragically this Oprah-Perry genre strategically links up with other ""easy"" racist anti-black male tropes within American society. That is to say, it links up with those whose sold and well known purpose is to openly and unabashedly further darken and denigrate the black man's already much maligned reputation and character.

The cheap melodramas mentioned in the first paragraph above as well as in this movie, all fit comfortably into the already prepared American family album of the four-cornered mainstream race/sex Kabuki dance. One album, the thickest of them all is labeled ""black male bashing;"" the other is labeled ""black female victimology."" The two that go unmentioned but are ever present in the subtext are: The ""Alpha Male white Hero,"" and the ""Alpha Female White Sex Goddess."" Even though these last two corners of the dance are not mentioned directly, they both serve as the unmistakable psychological backdrop to this sick and cheap faux drama.

Through this movie, black women (plus Tyler Perry, whose sexuality is of a floating and indeterminate nature) want the world to believe that ""bashing the black man"" and ""black women playing the role of intra-racial victim"" are but different sides of the same coin. The not so well hidden agenda running along in the subtext being: ""Aunt Jemima,"" is still pandering to the racist white sentiment as she once did with such great skill while in the ""Big House"" during slavery. But apparently the world is no longer buying this Oprah/Tyler Perry/Ester Rolle trope?

At least not from what we see in the most recent Pew Report on cross-racial dating. There we can see that the Oprah-Tyler sanctioned sport of ""black male bashing"" apparently is not having the desired effect at all because black men who date women other than black women are doing quite well despite being constantly reviled and castigated by their own women? In fact, black men with a college education are about seven times more likely to marry outside the race than similarly situated black women? Sounds to me like they are being rapidly driven away to other women?

At some point Oprah-led black women must ""woman-up"" and (Perry must ""man-up,"" or ""what-up"") and realize that the Oprah-Tyler strategy, deployed to the hilt in this movie, is not working (and not even privately for Oprah herself) and learn to stand on their own two feet in the open market, without leaning back on ""Aunt Jemima,"" ""black male bashing"" and ""being last years white woman"" tropes, as props to advance their insecurity driven causes and agendas. More importantly, there is a very definite boomerang effect from this incessant ""harping for false sympathy"" on grounds of ""black male bashing:"" It apparently causes eligible men from all races to think twice about dating or marrying black women? Anyone who doubts this, should just scan the web, or read the Pew Report.

At least this is what the recent Pew study shows: that men the world over see (for a whole host of reasons seen everywhere out on the web) black women as being the least desirable women in the world to date or marry. And sadly, these men are voting with their feet. Indeed, why would any man want a woman from a group where she incessantly bashes the men of her own race? As an example of how it should be done. It is well known that Chinese and Korean women do not much care for Chinese and Korean men either, but has anyone ever heard a Chinese woman or a Korean woman say an unkind word about Chinese or Korean men in public, or launch a national propaganda campaign of movies and dramas to rail against them? (I don't think so?)

The two-pronged message of this movie could not be more unsubtle and in your face. It is that: (1) Black men are the ""Kryptonite"" of the world, not just of American society: all women (not just black women) should beware of them and thus be forewarned, as there is an ego-destroying, emasculating, sexual predator let loose on American society and the world: it is called the generic black male? The Ku Klux Klan could not ask for a more active ally than a group with this message. Plus, who could miss the larger but cheapest subtext: that black women are still trying to strip us from the herd so that we are exclusively reserved sexually only for them. Otherwise, who is going to be jumping to date black women, if not that old dog they have succeeded in crippling, the black man?

As this movie so graphically depicts him, the black man is a culprit like the world has never seen before or will ever see again. In this movie, his disguises include that of a quite unassuming but slick and brutal rapist, a deranged double baby-killer, a father who engages in incest with his own daughters, a mentally-deranged psychopath who kills his own baby by throwing her off the balcony, plus an assortment of alcoholics, drug abusers, pimps, wife-beaters, and ""down-low"" homosexuals who purposefully transmit HIV and other venereal diseases. This is the way the black woman separates the black man from the herd so that he is available only to her sexually. Some kind of sick strategy wouldn't you say?

Black women who wantonly convey such damagingly graphic images must be reminded that the men they characterize in such vile ways cannot exclude their own fathers, brothers, uncles, sons and husbands, and would also include as well, the current President of the USA? For the distinctions made here are anything but subtle; they are sweeping and done with malice and deep painful vengeance. They do not leave much room for parsing out the good black man from the bad. Presumably if such exclusions are to be made at all, they will have to be made only in one-on-one situations.

The companion and complementary message is (2) that black women are the self-declared heroes in a tragic black-on-black drama of their own making, a drama whose truths, narratives and facts they alone control. The problem however is that even though they construct, write the scripts for, and control the facts of the narrative, they never ""own"" it or ""take responsibility"" for how it evolves, or for any of its bad outcomes? And as is usual for them, black women (like God herself) take credit for all of the good and hide from all the responsibility for any of the bad. They are the only ones in their own self-made dramas who are not responsible for the actions that take place within the script that they have alone created?

How can this be? If we look carefully at the multi-pronged (but facile) plot of this drama and take the resulting vignettes at face value, at the very least it makes the self-serving portrait that black women paint of themselves confusing and contradictory? For here we see that the black woman sees herself as guileless, guiltless, non-manipulative, un-controlling, chaste, sweet, innocent but still the virginal cardboard cutouts of ""last year's white woman,""a savvy woman who is constantly allowing herself to be tricked by the same old vile black male devil?"" Onto this self-flattering cardboard damsel in distress, we see reflected back and grafted onto her the rules, values, habits and desires of the same prototype: ""last year's white woman"" -- the black woman's alter ego, her double, her doppelgnger, or exact racial counterpart.

If one reads the tea leaves in the subtext of the mulit-pronged plot to this movie carefully, it is easy enough to see that it is a cheap melodrama taken from the TV sitcom playbook of ""last year's white woman?"" It leads one to only one conclusion: Today's black woman's reality is just the left over debris of the TV reality shows of last year's white woman -- yearning to get rehearsed and played out in real time as contemporary black woman reality? And, as is so expertly shown here, the black woman's reality is nothing more and nothing less than that: a sad rehearsal of last year's ""White woman TV reality show.""

At its worse black woman reality is a ""piggyback reality"" steeped in imagined white women fantasy: a loose collage of overly sexualized and slutty images, leaning heavily towards the haughty and glamorous, glittery but always empty of any substance or humanity whatsoever, but always consistent with white pop-culture and reality TV norms. In one scene the sisters were actually angry that black women were not being chosen to be ""the dancing hos"" in a hip-hop video? (Jeez, please give me a frigging break?) And at its best, black women reality is just a cheap imitation and caricature of high-white society - overly moralized but a plasticized TV version of it hyped with self-made Aunt Jemima delusions and psychology laid-on.

The saddest part of all this is that from this movie, one does not get a feeling that there is such a thing as a ""normal black woman,"" or even a ""normal black woman image?"" (She is always a weak Aunt Jemima, or a second hand damsel in digress, looking askance from the white woman or white man for validation?) Or even worse yet, we do not get the impression that there is even a distinctive or unique black woman humanity? (After all, Aunt Jemima's humanity is always ""on loan"" from last year's white woman?)

From this movie all we see is that from top to bottom, from mother to daughter, from ""ho's"" to ""saints,"" from a modern day ""Aunt Jemima"" to ""Wall Street executives (always carrying their Teddy Bears),"" this is a ""reality show"" scavenged from the bottom of the American white woman barrel?  It is impossible to make a mistake on this point as there are multiple vignettes coming at the same cheap messages from different angles and different vantage points. The message in the subtext is as clear as the attack on black men is up front in the context: Take away last year's white woman, and there is nothing remaining of the black woman. They have bought the hype about white women hook, line and sinker.

And anyway you read it, it spells cheap, cheap, cheap; empty, empty, empty; and whining, whining, whining? The question begging for the viewer to answer is this: To whom are these black women whining to? The unmistakable answer any thinking person will get is that they are whining to racist white people. Who, else? After all, is that not how Aunt Jemimas ""make their bones?""

But this is not the whole psychological story. There is another level of dishonesty to the faux black woman appealed for sympathy in the subtext of this drama. It is an admission of defeat in the face of what they see as the ""Alpha Female White woman."" The black women of today, are actually in competition with their main idols, ""last year's white women."" However, they lack the courage to face the competition straight up, toe-to-toe. So instead, they adopt all of the behaviors of last years white women, making it clear that they are not in competition with ""today's white woman,"" whom they relish becoming.

And thus it would not be an exaggeration of the movie's main message to suggest that the black woman's reality is almost always rooted in a quiet kind of smoldering envy of white women; and thus of a kind of ""reflected white women glory,"" as well as a reflection of their sexual desires and fantasies about money, men and wealth."" In short, judging by what is ""seen in relief"" in this drama, in the subtext, black women compose their own script of meanings and yearnings from the debris left behind by last year's white woman, meanings and yearnings that when all arranged in order and pasted together, do not quite add up to a single complete picture of a human being, not to mention of an image of a proud and heroic woman?

The black woman image in this movie is a composite made up of ""black male bashing,"" ""slutty images yearning to be rich and pampered,"" ""deflected anger at their model of womanhood, last year's white woman,"" with a hefty dose of mean-spirited cattiness and ""Aunt Jemima genuflecting thrown in for good measure."" When totaled up, no matter how much they beat their fake feminist chest, this image does not a proud woman make? Where is the black woman humanity in this depiction of a psychological train wreck?

How can the producers of this ""faux drama"" be so mindlessly careless as not to realize that any thinking viewer would be able to see through this tissue paper thin chest-beating pseudo-feminist bombast to the subtext of real pain that is being deflected onto the black man?  What is clearly visible in the subtext is not a picture of a heroine, even in a movie engineered by a black women author. It is a picture of a mental desexed-lesbian cripple, someone cut from a tribe that is neutered, unwanted, unloved and unvalidated. Put simply, black women have stepped into a gender quick sand on the other side of the racial divide, quicksand of their own making. Quicksand that they are now desperately trying to pull themselves out of, with the hope that it can then be used to build a new sand castle of? And they want us black men, and the whole black race to join them in this quicksand drowning ceremony.

I say, no thank you. We too would prefer to go it alone. Boy what a waste of a lot of good acting, three stars for the acting.",1334620800,2,15022,4.788884600540332

4220323,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"Ntozake Shange's ""For Colored Girls"" - While watching this movie I had mixed emotions but continue to be grateful to Tyler Perry for bringing this important work to film.  This film really touches all races of women in a variety of ways.

All Black women are not like and most have not experienced the tragic women portrayed in this work.  However, all of us know someone who is/has.  ""Precious"" was ""exposed"" with Black actresses and the Black community screamed at the audacity of showing Black women in those situations. I found ""For Colored Girls"" as illuminating as ""Precious"".  I learned something more about the nature of man, albeit horrific, and have a more compassionate understanding of certain personalities.

We are the most multifacted women on the face of this earth.  We, Black women, have experienced every emotional experience known to man and still ""We Rise"".

The movie industry has shown white (and other races) women in a variety of instances and we have laughed, cried and wondered why did they perform in that particular venue.  Well, now they are showing Black women in that same critical way.  In every movie I have ever seen I have either been simply entertained or I have learned something about human nature.

Enjoy lessons exposed - Thank You Tyler Perry.

I knew it was going to be a very emotional experience for me so I chose to wait for it to come out on dvd to watch in the privacy and comfort of my home.  I knew it would affect me in a lot of ways that I would want to experience in private.  The performances in this movie were mesmerizing. The screenplay was a beautiful thread that wove together the poetry that is For Colored Girls.  The movie is not unfortunately, just For Colored Girls.  My understanding is the original book and play represented a diaspora of women, all colors all walks of life.  That is the true meaning of this movie.  It could just as easily be done with an all white cast, an all hispanic cast, an all asian cast, and have the same impact, because the experience of colored girls, unfortunately, is a universal experience.

It made me think about the time I got raped by this married man who was on the ""down low"" and gave me HIV but then kept going back to his wife (even though I begged hime not to a million times) then he got stabbed by her after she found out he gave her PID and couldn't ever have kids with him. After that I scraped up the money for college and after graduation I got a high powered Ad exec job but by that time I had become a stone-cold B and couldn't relate to my ""peeps"" anymore. I finally came back down to earth after being schooled by this wise old lady who happened to live in the apt next door and had ""been through it all before"" me.

The play of this movie has been performed in many countries all over the world with actresses of various/different races. No matter what the race or culture of the women, there are women who need to learn to love themselves and when they do this, they will make good life decisions and relationship decisions. When women have a healthy love and esteem for themselves they will not put up with certain things or allow unhealthy men to enter into their lives.

The end of the movie was also uplifting as the women realized who they really are and how God has created them beautiful. We get to see them realize that they are better than the circumstances they allowed themselves to be drawn into. You know that they will triumph.

The acting was superb and the poetic verse was very creatively done. It was good to see so many great and talented actresses and actors in this movie as we don't see many of them as often as I would like to see them in more Hollywood starring roles.

For Colored Girls showed alot of different situtaions of these different women is rape,abuse,abandonment and abortion. Is the character Crystal played by Kimberly Elise that she was in abusive relationship with her boyfriend Beau Willie that part in the movie was sad when he killed those kids by throwing them out the apartment window! I blame the social worker for this cause she should've did more that she can to protect those kids and to take those kids away from Crystal and definetly away from Beau cause they wasn't safe to be around him. Another scene in the movie I thought it was sad when the Dance Teacher Yasmine got raped by this guy name Bill that she was dating. When I saw this rape scene I couldn't believe he did that to her cause he seemed such a nice and gentleman kind of guy! It goes to show us to be careful of the guys that we date and to trust them.

The feel of pain and suffering in poetry should remain in the imagination of the listener, and not sensensionalized with blood, gore, and violence like it is done in cheap B movies geared toward audiences with the minds of pre-adolescent males.
Despite powerful performances by Kimberly Elise, Thandie Newton, Kerry Washington, Anika Noni Rose, and Tessa Thompson to name a few, I can't give this movie more than one star  because it doesn't deserve more.

Mr. Perry, stick with Madea. We all enjoy her!!",1305158400,6,639,4.962616822429907
4220410,3,B003Y5H4ZM,"I totally understand why Tyler Perry wanted to make this film.  Considered one of the more popular Black filmmakers today (what has this world come to), Perry has been searching for that special project that would give him the respect he desires.  I mean, he's RICH, but no one really takes him seriously, and he wants that BAD.

Putting my initial reservations on hold, I have to admit that this project seemed promising.  I don't know what Tyler Perry's hold is on the Black community, but it seems like every Black actor or actress goes to him for work.  So, with a dramatic prose and a slew of fantastic actresses, Tyler Perry set off to make what promised to be his grand opus.  To think that he wasn't praying to Oprah for an Oscar is plain silly.  You know that every day of production was an inch closer to that podium (in his mind).

And why not?

I'll tell you why not; Tyler Perry couldn't handle this film.  The source material (the play `For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf' by Ntozake Shange) calls for an imaginative director, someone with vision and personality.  I don't know if Perry was afraid of screwing this all up, but he approached this in such a straightforward and unimaginative manner that it lost all of the `specialness' it could have had.  I'll say this; the opening sequence with Anika Noni Rose dancing, with the soft pastels and the stirring music, was superb.  From that point forward the film started a steep decline.  The play, being broken out into 20 poems, really needed an artistic display in order to retain its poignancy.  By approaching the film in such a realistic manner it added a layer of camp to the film that just didn't fit.  The poems are just that, poems, and so when they are spoken as part of natural dialog they become somewhat disjointed from the rest of the film.  Had a more artistic director found ways to incorporate those poems within the fabric of the film, even finding ways to highlight the poems by removing them from the specific scenes, it would have shone.  If the poems had been treated like musical numbers even, removing them from the realistic dynamics of the film, it would have given the entire feel of the film a more absorbing nature.  Tyler Perry also has trouble directing dramatics.  I saw this in `Why Did I Get Married'.  He has a tendency to overdramatize things and it frays the initial realisms.  He falls into clich&eacute;s in parts (the rape scene corresponding with the opera felt very `dramatics 101') and he borders on camp in others (the window-drop scene, which is HORRIFIC, comes across like a poorly executed TV movie).  He just didn't know how to work with the elements in this film.  Also, expanding the characters from 7 to 20 took away from some character development and the actual flow of the film, making it choppy and uneven in scenes.

It tends to jump around a lot.

And yet, there is one dynamic of this film that really works; the actressing.  Yes, this is an actress-lovers dream come true.  The list of actresses working their magic here is nearly never ending, and while some of them don't live up to expectations, there are a few that really deliver sharp and provocative performances.  Kimberly Elise and Kerry Washington are easily the film standouts, both of them capturing the sincerity and emotional collapse of their characters.  I also thought that Phylicia Rashad was triumphant.  Janet Jackson handles her `poem' better than anyone else (it actually fits the setup rather well) and Anika Noni Rose shows us why we still remember her `Dreamgirls' performance; she drips charisma and charm.  Some actresses don't fare as well.  Loretta Devine becomes a caricature and Thandie Newton is choppy and uneven and over-the-top.  Tessa Thompson's poetry reading was atrociously handled (one of the worst scenes in the film) and while Janet Jackson nailed her poem, her overall performance felt like a poorly realized rip off of Streep's `Devil Wears Prada' performance.  Whoopi Goldberg had a very hard character to sell, but she does it to a degree, and the way her poem was weaved in with Newton's was possibly the most artistic moment in the entire film.

Why couldn't every poem been given such sharp attention?

In the end, `For Colored Girls' had promise, and it does carry some weight, but it just isn't handled in ways that really lives up to that promise.  Aside from some very fine performances, the film falls apart under the directors lacking.",1304294400,4,4500,4.736503856041131

When I complained about ""what I received"" as opposed to ""what I ordered"" and demanded my money back, this company provided me a refund and told me to keep the DVD. The representative also told me that the movie I ordered indicated on the Amazon webpage that it was a ""copy""! I am a Screen Actor's Guild member. I would never purchase such a thing, furthermore, it's against the law to copy a movie and sell it to the public.

4220482,4,B003Y5H4ZM,"The price of a movie at the theatre is rising as fast as gasoline prices these days so it is usually my choice to wait until a film is released on DVD before I view it.  Fortunately, because of technology, this wait is nowhere near as long as it used to be and if a film is not an astonishing hit at the box office, there is more of a chance that it will get released on DVD fairly quickly.  I had every intention of seeing For Colored Girls on the big screen but it didn't happen so I chose the next best thing; to purchase it on DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised though I had already heard from friends who had seen it on the big screen that it was a film well worth viewing.  Tyler Perry has elevated the art of the telling of the story of urban experience to new heights.  He draws from his own personal experience in almost everything he writes and directs.  His stories ring true to life no matter how outrageous.  Though Media may be as overblown a character as they come, I think everyone knows or has at least heard a story or two of the proverbial ""pistol-packin' mama"" and had a good belly laugh if not completely taken it to heart.  In For Colored Girls, he has used the original stage production as a guide and re-worked it in a way which is totally screen-worthy.  Janet Jackson's performance is riveting as a first class business woman w/a heart of stone which of course hides a myriad of pain in her personal life which also prevents her from at first recognizing that same kind of pain in others.  Whoopi Goldberg, Phylicia Rashad, Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, Macy Gray and Kerry Washington also give astonishing performances.  Whether one is a fan of Tyler Perry's formula of production, direction, writing and production, For Colored Girls is a film worth seeing if only to see how he attempted to spread his wings and stretch beyond his usual way of storytelling.",1301270400,2,1919,4.454285714285715

Overarching lesson (IMHO):  women have significant power between their legs and with the exercise of great power comes great responsibility.  this lesson does not seem to fit crystal - whose relationship should have been a movie in itself.  Unfortunately, like most Perry movies, there is wonderful emphasis on depicting the outcomes of the problem and drawing out the attendant emotional trauma, but little attention paid to the solution of it b/c this would often cast the blame on the ""victim"" and the ""victimizer"".  Because of the impact of media on the collective female psyche (especially black women) I do think it was socially irresponsible to show the blackman intentionally dropping his kids out of the window in a fit of misdirected rage b/c black women will latch on to that image and label every vet as a potential psycho (same re professional so called ""down lo"" brothers).  An implicit lesson I saw was that black women don't get the same benefit (commitment, continued respect, marriage proposal) from opening their legs as their noncoloured (white) counterparts.  The current debate is whether this disparity stems from blackness or boisterousness.  Also there is a conflict in women between being led by their emotion as opposed to the reality of the situation - the emotion seeks ""fantasy"" where none exists - many men capitalize on this frailty (with great power comes responsibility to not be led by your emotions).  Facing the reality that emotion/fantasy led decisions leads to dire consquences has a humbling effect which tends to harden women over time.  It is difficult in a world that perpetuates the lie that who men and women can become is limited only by our desires.",1299974400,,1797,5.02020202020202

4220633,2,B003Y5H4ZM,"In 2011, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who never heard of playwright-turned-producer Tyler Perry, or his iconic creation, Madea.  After several years' worth of successful screenplays, Perry debuted with Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005), a big screen adaptation of his similarly named play.  Hot off the heels of his box office success, Perry churned out several other movies, Madea or otherwise, and TV-based side projects (i.e., Meet the Browns and House of Payne).  But despite Perry's accomplishments, some critics and moviegoers think his talents as a writer/director are limited.

It's hard to disagree.  With few exceptions, Perry's narratives follow a common, clichd path: the trifling black man making the heroine's life hell, the hooker with a heart of gold, the upstanding black man who's a beacon of hope for the heroine, the comeuppance of said trifling black man, and the holier-than-thou Christians who provide sage knowledge to the younger, feral generation.  Perry's films often have the subtlety of a Lifetime movie, with all the preachiness and unintentional hilarious abuse scenes that comes with it.  Even though Perry's presence provides material for a starved demographic - black Christian women - it offers little for everyone else.

Perry's latest movie, an adaptation of Ntozake Shange's For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuf, tackles these issues head on with a harrowing narrative of eight Brooklyn women struggling to survive through their messy lives.  In several ways, it feels like Paul Haggis's Crash, only with black females facing sexism as opposed to ripple effect racism.  Personal tragedies afflict each protagonist, whether past, present or future, and they affect the lives of the people around them, whether directly or indirectly.  By the movie's climax, most of these characters settle for a bittersweet end to their journeys, bruised and exhausted.

To Perry's credit, making a movie based off a fairly obscure collection of 1970s black feminist poems takes guts.  It's a step forward to slake his fledging artistry of his earlier films.  Perry freeing his own inner demons also fueled his desire, and at times, that intense passion emerges.  There are even some scenes, at least on the technical side, that are worth applause.  To soften the horror of one character's rape, it was juxtaposed with a serene opera scene.  As a filmmaker, Perry shows improvement.

Alas, For Colored Girls shares many of Crash's flaws, along with its own unique faults.  For one, having the same eight or so characters run into each other in New York, a city that's always crowded with hundreds of inhabitants, feels contrived after a while.  Likewise, viewers have to suspend disbelief that these females are experiencing a lifetime worth of catastrophes within (presumably) two weeks.  Perry choosing to include Shange's poems into the film, while welcome in theater, does more harm than good here.  In the midst of a traumatizing experience, having characters recite Shange's monologues grinds the action to a halt, and don't flow with the characters' natural dialogue.  After about the third or fourth poem, it's too tempting to ignore them entirely.

Some of Perry's bad habits also reappear at instances, like the lack of nuance with the ladies' lives.  Any chance of proper character development became compromised with so many characters shuffled through at any given moment.  While this flaw isn't as noticeable here as in Perry's other films, For Colored Girls being devoid of any real complexity makes even these women's extreme difficulties feel surprisingly shallow.  One cringe worthy example involved a sexual awareness instructor informing one character about how to take care of herself after her husband infected her with an STD.  It sounded like a laughable PSA, and added nothing to the story.  Elsewhere, the black males are simplistically portrayed, whether their behavior's honorable or despicable (mostly deplorable).  Instead of Perry giving them multi-layered reasons for their personalities, he coasts by with damning stereotypes, like the down low brother or the womanizer who drifts between two women.  While I won't claim that the mostly un-heroic male cast was Perry's thinly veiled attack towards black men, I wish there was more balance than just Harper Hill's noble detective.

The only thing that kept For Colored Girls from falling apart was the wonderful performances by the actresses involved.  Phylicia Rashad, with her character being the anti-Mrs. Huxtable, and Kimberly Elise, as the mother of two kids and the wife of a PTSD war vet, were especially good.  Conversely, Janet Jackson, usually a delight on the screen, looked lifeless at times; even taking account the deadened expressiveness of her character, a sardonic magazine mogul.  Everyone else was more-or-less superb, reflecting the raw wounds that still sting during their characters' individual breaking points.  Too bad Perry marginalized those moments by awkwardly injecting Shange's poetry and/or surrounding them with treacly melodrama.

At times, For Colored Girls flashed moments worth real discussion.  Near the end, hearing the women dissecting the endless excuses men have told them for too many years was an eye opener for this [male] viewer.  Several scenes suggest how even women's lack of solidarity exacerbated the problems depicted in the movie.  A better filmmaker would have exposed that subject with deftness.  Instead, with Perry's vision, For Colored Girls rings hollow as social commentary.",1298937600,3,5579,5.330285714285714
4220634,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"This movie is honestly alot to digest.  The subject matter explores the mystery of the human heart and the human condition we all suffer from.  It was alot more depressing than I expected.  For Colored Girls is not a popcorn movie that u would watch with a date or family.  I think it's more designed for intellectual types, artists or film lovers.  The performances are what really carry this movie.  My favourite character was Lorretta Devine's character.  Janet Jackson also gave her best acting performance in her career.  I also was mesmorized by Macy Gray's cameo, it was a surreal and mystical performance that just makes your jaw drop.

If I'd seen it in the theater, I would have had to run out during one scene in particular that made me scream out loud AND cry.  This movie makes all Black men look like so many bad things, except for 1 guy who was a cop.  If I were to say any of the things the men do I'd be giving it away.  But even men YOU DON'T SEE, that are just MENTIONED are horrible.  This should scare any non African American women out of dating a Black man EVER.  It made Black women look pathetic and helpless.  I will say, everyone's ACTING was very good, and all the women looked very pretty.  The directing was also good.  One of the things you may find distracting was the way the regular dialogue would stop and they would talk in verse for a while.  It's not a movie I'd want to see again because the subject matter is truly depressing.",1298678400,8,930,4.150837988826815
4220636,5,B003Y5H4ZM,"Tyler Perry has performed a little miracle in transferring Ntozake Shange's exquisite play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" into an opened up and expanded film.  The dialogue still is deeply embedded in Shange's poetry but the narrative Perry added makes the stage experience a flowing cinematic story: the result is a powerful film that happens to be populated by some of the finest actresses of today.

The plat cannot be faithfully summarized, as it is a cluster of vignettes of ten women in crisis. Each character is given the name of a color of the rainbow, but they also have real names and the men in their off track lives actually do appear.  It would be unfair to single out any one of these actresses as best because their roles are all different and make demands on the actresses in different ways.  Whoopie Goldberg is the religiously inclined mother of Thandie Newton (a woman of physical needs that cannot be satisfied despite nightly change of partners) and Tessa Thompson (a high school girl with aspirations crushed by an unwanted pregnancy); Janet Jackson is a bitter, wealthy magazine editor married to the Down Low Omari Hardwick; Loretta Devine is a community service giver in a relationship with the undependable Richard Lawson; Kimberly Elise (breathtakingly magnificent!) is paired with the war-torn PTSD alcoholic and abusive Michael Ealy; Kerry Washington works for child services despite her infertility in her marriage to Hill Harper; Anika Noni Rose is a lovely innocent dance teacher brutally treated by Khalil Kain; Phylicia Rashad is the tenement house manager who is the central mother confessor to her tenants.  How these women's lives are interconnected is fascinating as a story/screenplay: how these gifted actresses deliver the poetry of Shange is beyond anyone's expectations.

There are many issues this film deals with - single mother, violence against women, death, loss, partner abuse, etc - and each of the issues is poignant and keenly defined and acted.  How this film slipped under the line for awards is anyone's guess.  It is not to be missed.  Grady Harp, February 11",1298505600,2,2157,5.053521126760564

I've read the poetry, which was written in the 1970's and reflected upon a much different time and placement for Black women. I understand Tyler Perry's want to re-invent and structure the story for this day and age, but I wasn't impressed by any means. I was actually quite saddened at how naive and completely victimized every female character in this movie was. I mean one female after the other seemed to walk directly into a fire pit and then seem to look dauntingly for sympathy. Speaking as a Black woman, I found no way to relate to ANY of these women. A mother too blind to see the cancer of a man she's living and allowing to control the miserable life around her for which she later seeks sympathy for his antics; A woman desperately seeking male attention that she continually allows a man to dictate when she receives his love because she's sharing him with another woman; A woman who is so aptly blinded by a man's slight charm that she becomes his rape victim; A woman grasping so tightly to power and control around her because she's lost control in her love life and wakes up with AIDS; A girl who becomes sexually promiscuous before her time and ends up pregnant; Her sister who uses her body as a means of ""trade"" to make sense of being sexually abused years earlier; Then you have Phylicia Rashad & Whoopi Goldberg's whose story lines seemed to be dropped in more as product placement than anything. Then you have the seventh woman who cannot have children and that seems to be her only problem, which compared to the other women really can be solved. I was appalled at this film and I would not buy it or ever watch it again, the depictions don't resonate ""Empowerment"" but shear and utter contempt because as Black women I believe we're supposed to not only be smarter than this, but a whole lot better than this.

I have been a fan since i was 10 and now 35 i am still a fan, and support this woman with all of her endeavors.  this movie was not just about JANET.  IMO, ALL of the actresses, minus WHOOPI (since she actually has an OSCAR for supporting actress) were kind of weak.  they are all class B with their own inconsistencies with delivery in front of the camera.  LORETTA, plays the SAME humorous characters most times, THANDIE was just trying TOO hard at times to become her character, MACY is good at playing ODD characters, but is that really acting? ANIKA's role was cute, KERRY, not the greatest actress, but she played it safe.  JANET, trying to come out of that whispering voice, played a decent role, her role in WHY DID I GET MARRIED TOO? solidifies her talent as an actress and IMO was better than this one.  i don't think she was in any way trying to be MERYL STREEP's character from DEVIL WEARS PRADA, like someone mentioned.  this was TYLER's production, and they were ALL directed in his vision, so don't blame the actresses. KIMBERLY'S weakness as an actress really came through at the end.  her MONOLOGUE was just GOD awful, but her effort throughout the movie was very commendable.  OVERALL, this was a GOOD movie, not GREAT, it's an ADAPTATION and not TYLER's ORIGINAL work, so he's gets a B+ for effort, had it been his original work, i would have given him an A-.  he can now add this as one of his more serious works along with THE FAMILY THAT PREYS.  his cast was a line of B+ actresses, NONE of them OUTSTANDING in their delivery, but they each had their moments, and it was these moments that were brought together and made for a strong movie as a whole.",1297296000,,1790,4.390909090909091

I admit, I have not yet read the collection of poems, but due to this movie I am inclined to do so.  Art is interpreted in many ways and I feel that Tyler's interpretation was one of info-tainment.  One reviewer feels that the movie was ""too dark"", however Tyler Perry has been consistent with portraying reflection.  He shows us people/issues/etc. that occur in our community.  He shows us ourselves.  Our lives are sometimes filled with sorrow; are sometimes dark and for someone to say that kind of offends me.

As for each woman's story being left unfulfilled, I disagree.  As each woman spoke on the roof, you saw their possibility.  You saw their victories.  That, I believe was the point.  It was far better than giving me an ""...and they lived happily ever after"" ending.  That would be a fallacy.  Each woman was to endure as their time went on.  It is inevitable that obstacles would continue to present themselves.  We were to see their strength in how the overcame their current situations.  I thought the movie was beautifully done.

4220727,2,B003Y5H4ZM,"I read the book years ago, so even before I watched this movie I knew what I was getting myself into.  Like the other reviewer said, this movie is depressing and serves no purpose other than to shock and depress and further serve to delineate black women.

Personally I am sick to the back teeth of depressing movies dedicated to and 'celebrating' the black woman's plight.  At length and last we finally have decent black directors but they still continue to churn out the same clichd stuff year after year.  Honestly, it's little wonder any black women get married at all.  By all accounts we appear to be damaged goods and no one goes out intentionally looking for damaged goods; I wouldn't.  Can anyone see a pattern below ?

Waiting to Exhale - A movie dedicated to black women and their non existent love lives
Diary of a Mad Black Woman - The title speaks for itself ( in fact throw in all the Tyler Perry movies)
Jungle Fever - Black man would prefer to love a white woman ( in fact throw in all the Spike Lee movies)
American Gangster - Black drugster makes it big by having black women working in his crack factories
Madea's family Reunion - Incest, child abuse and physical abuse
Disappearing Acts - Black woman and her useless black man
The Brothers - Black men who have issues loving black women
Two can play that game - Black people and their stupid games of love
Soul Food - Sister sleeps with other sister's man
The Color Purple - Incest and sexual abuse
How Stella got her groove - Black woman can't find a man in America so she goes to Jamaica to find herself a toy boy
Good Hair - Huh ????? I mean why was this even made.  People don't have Google ?
Precious - Violent sexual abuse of a child by her father culminating in her becoming pregnant TWICE.

The list goes on and on but I'm sure anyone reading this see's what I am driving at.  No more drama. please.  Can we sit down and PLEASE be entertained with stories of young black people finding love, respecting themselves and each other, getting married, not being baby mama's, not being raped by their fathers, step fathers, uncles, lovers and boyfriends, can we watch movies of professional black people and blue collar black people being respectful and loving towards each other.  Can we see movies of black people taking romantic trips to Europe and drinking latte's in Rome.  There is drama in other communities.  I don't know why we black people feel a need to share OUR failings with the whole world and worse of all, we must be raging mas*chists to want to sit down, part with good money to watch two hours of depression centred around our people.",1297209600,64,2627,4.480083857442348

Janet Jackson looks like the A-list woman she has become. Glammed up and just beautiful. Kimberly Elise should have gotten some Oscar consideration. She carries alot of the weight of the mega-emotionally charged drama. I am pleased to welcome this picture into my collection.",1297036800,15,488,4.752941176470588

I think those who are lucky enough to have had a safe, wonderful and happy life will not understand what this movie is about.  I am soon to be 27 years old this month and this movie hit home with me.  During my teen years I was depressed. Not overly depressed as to where I took meds and therapy but just enough to walk the line.  I felt alone and knew my family couldn't help me.  There were times I thought about suicide.  I though that no one would miss me and no one would care.  I thought that my family would be better off.  I just didn't feel important.  This movie reminded me of that time in my life.  How I over came it and how I'm still searching for my rainbow.  This movie touched me in ways I thought were impossible.  It is something that I can hold dear to my heart.  It is heart felt and touches on some good, serious points of life.  All though all of Tyler Perry's movies are good and funny. This movie in no way compares to any of the other comic Madea movies.",1296691200,2,1088,4.018691588785047

If I was a person that liked poetry I could see enjoying it, but those words were lost on me.  It just seemed to go on and on and on...became monotone to my ears.  The acting was okay for the most part.  Although they all had their moments Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine and Phyllisca Rashad did the best in my book, they made the movie worth watching and so did Whoopie.  Not quite sure how closely this movie relates to the book but hopefully the book was more entertaining.  I am not trying to stop or get in the way of anyone purchasing this movie but I will warn you not to be surprised if your excitement dwindles down like mine did when I watched it.",1296604800,2,798,4.142857142857143
4220782,2,B003Y5H4ZM,"There are many things wrong with this overcooked soaplike film based on a famous theater play about what it feels like to be an african-american female today. First and foremost ,is the manner Tyler Perry handles these women - more like vessels for ideas and messages instead of fully fleshed characters . All nine women in "" For Colored Girls "" go through various horrible situations : rape , child molestation , physical abuse , infidelity and the list goes on and on . The movie has enough material for ten weepy filmfests all cornered though , in it's 133 minutes .

 I have heard many of the talented , ambitious actresses saying in interviews how much the film has touched them and how special it was for them . Im glad they connected so deep with the material . It's a pity that what reaches the screen is so uneven and doesn't do justice to their efforts . The wonderful Kerry Washighton is totally wasted in a thankless role of a social worker . Same goes for Anika Noni Rose who plays dance instructor Yasmine . Janet Jackson as Jo gets more time on screen , does not seem comfortable as the other,more experienced co-stars in the dramatic scenes yet its interesting to see the singer-songwritter , whose career has been rather uneven the last decade , try something like this . Best of all are Phylicia Rashad as Gilda and Kimberly Elise as Crystal , the wounded heart of the film .

What i probably think bothered me the most is how eager the director was for tears from his stars . All the monologues fail miserably and the oscar-baiting scenes are so many with so few breaths for the viewer inbetween , its impossible not to feel fed up . Minutes - no , seconds after Yasmine's tearful confession after her rape comes Nyla's delirium about her abortion . The director doesn't seem to know what the word restrain means . It's a shame cause there are moments like the wonderful last scene of the film with all of the girls together hugging each other, where "" For Colored Girls "" really shows it's lost potential .",1296345600,18,2026,4.47027027027027

4220784,4,B003Y5H4ZM,"I've never been the biggest Tyler Perry fan simply because he does not have the technical training, such as writing and directing, that most of his contemporaries have, yet Blacks in particular settle for the mediocrity he presents and laud it just because the characters look like them and are relatable or entertaining, or even because he is Black and the need to support him because there just aren't enough like him out there in the genre.  Well, I don't.  He doesn't measure to the likes of those who brought us Black ensemble films like ""Love Jones"" and ""The Best Man.""  I'll never knock his hustle--he's done good for himself by far--but I never saw the potential...until this film.

Aesthtically, the film was beautifully shot.  That initially grabbed my attention.  The locations popped, and the settings complimented the actors nicely.  The writing was above his standards, but I guess I'll give it to him even though it was an adaptation, so the script really required little on his part.  His ""work"" on the script does however shine in some missteps, such as Janet Jackson's character, the Lady in Red, from her poor imitation of Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" to most of the paultry storyline.  He only redeems himself in the final confrontation scene between her and her husband which was so intense words just can't describe it.  The actresses were phenomenally cast.  Though I get tired of seeing Loretta Devine playing the same role over and over again and fear that she probably has become type cast for the latter part of her career, she delivered like only she could.  Janet Jackson is not that great of an actress, maybe prior to and including Poetic Justice, but the majority of the cast outdid her, and for the life of me I wish Perry would stop giving her top billing as if she is a box office draw--in her arena (music) yes, but not in film.  She hasn't earned it yet.  Thandie Newton's accent was jarring at times in her portrayal of the Lady in Orange, but she seemed to be more believeable than the thought of Mariah Carey, who dropped out, in the role.  Macy Gray seemed more fitting to play Whoopi Goldberg's Lady in White and vice versa as Rose, but they were good nonetheless.  Phylicia Rashad was equally effective as a strong supporting cast member, but it was Kimberly Elise as the Lady in Brown that stole the movie effortlessly with her acting.  If ever this movie is to get any kind of Oscar nomination, this woman deserves to be recognized.

Overall, I was impressed.  I didn't come into this film with high expectations, but left feeling that Perry actually was in the right frame of mind when he handled Ntozake Shange's play.  And I felt that for once he truly used his position, power, and product to send a real message to his audience.  I still felt there was a weakness in the film's script, but it was a very endearing piece of work, the first in a good while for Black films.  For whatever reason Perry decided to commit to this project, be it a chance to get some Oscar recognizition and for once be taken seriously as a writer/producer or what, I hope he learns from this experience and builds on it.  The potential is there, and this was a worthy testament of that.",1295827200,9,3247,4.618466898954704
4220785,3,B003Y5H4ZM,"Excellent acting!  You could not find a better cast of actresses to perform their roles in this movie.  Their performances were magnificent - 5 stars! However, I was turned off with the continual negative theme throughout this movie that portrayed black woman in these unresolved plights. I'm uncomfortable with this holistic characterization of black women.  I realize the title of the movie makes clear the storyline, but when you consider that Perry made a decision to deviate somewhat from the orginal version of the play, I had hoped to see some balance... some closure or remedy to some of these womens dilemmas.  I left the theatre feeling depressed.  I'm a fan of Tyler Perry's plays and most of his movies, however, this movie along with his movie ""Precious"" is just too dark for me.",1295654400,2,792,4.880597014925373
4220786,1,B003Y5H4ZM,"Women are good and men are evil...there, I reviewed all Tyler Perry movies. David Edelstein from NYMAG.com summed it up best with his review:

""In Precious, the African-American lesbian couple who give the heroine a glimpse of domestic happiness have a poster for Ntozake Shange's ""choreopoem"" For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. It was such a clichd accessory that I rolled my eyes, but Tyler Perry--who lent his name to Precious as an executive producer--must have licked his lips. He has taken Shange's landmark poem cycle for seven African-American actresses, cut it up, and sewn its bloody entrails into a tawdry, masochistic soap opera that exponentially ups the Precious ante.

For Colored Girls is so shamelessly terrible it would make a great midnight hoot-fest, if you had the stomach to laugh at Shange or some of the best (and most underused) actresses of their generation: Kimberly Elise, Kerry Washington, Anika Noni Rose, Phylicia Rashad, and, as a cartoon sexpot, Thandie Newton, who gets by on her killer timing. At various mundane junctures, each woman begins to speak high-flown verse while other characters gaze on like extras in Oklahoma! They are all victimized by men--figures left abstract onstage but here embodied by one stereotypical dog after another. The women are plenty stereotyped, too, with Janet Jackson getting the worst of it as an Anna Wintour-like magazine diva who doesn't know that her assistant (Elise) is being abused by an alcoholic Iraq-vet husband. The most ludicrous sequence is a rape that's crosscut with an abortion (by a chain-smoking, vodka-swilling back-alley abortionist) and a scene at the opera in which Jackson realizes her husband is gay. Grand opera: what a touch. The cameras are shoved in the actresses' faces to catch their inevitable teardrops, which for Tyler are his climaxes--the money shots.""",1295568000,17,1894,5.20655737704918
