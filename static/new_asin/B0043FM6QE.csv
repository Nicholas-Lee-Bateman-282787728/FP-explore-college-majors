8414829,2,B0043FM6QE,"Rachel Carson must have been very disappointed with this rendering of her book. Of course, by today's production standards the movie is poorly made with the sound and video resolution of the times. Regardless, from the very start, it simplifies her treatment of the many scientific theories (then) regarding Earth's origin and early development and simply gives it all a religious beginning.  This DVD is only for those with a serious historical interest.",1528156800,,455,5.232876712328767

8414833,4,B0043FM6QE,As a fan of old documentaries and Mr. Allen's work I was satisfied with this rare treat and glad I bought it. Chuckling at the aghast 21st century reviewers who are offended by Mr. Allen's adaptation of Saint Rachel's first Testament. Back in the 50s men were men and they knew that when you encounter a possible dangerous creature (like say a manta ray or a sand shark) you blast it with a spear gun or maybe an explosive-tipped harpoon.,1415318400,3,438,4.4875

again sold the rights to her books.
...............

-- and with schlockmeister irwin at the helm, it's no wonder --
after suffereng through the initial heavy handed attempts at
proselytising, the viewer is treated to a thematically
confused 60 minutes that veers mindlessly from
gawking at the under water 'freaks'  to
gee whiz, look at the variety of life  to
hey, let's kill some helpless sea creatures for 'sport'  --
building to a climax, we are entertained by a mass killing of
king crabs (an infinitesimal preview of things to come)
and for the finale we are treated to the blow by blow slaughter
of a whale  -- as the screen fills with blood (and the viewer
with revulsion) we see in no uncertain terms the true nature
of man's 'stewadship' of this planet --
..........
shame on the producers -- if they had wanted to make a film
insulting everything Rachel Carson stood for , they coulldn't
have done a better job",1347667200,6,972,4.627906976744186
8414835,5,B0043FM6QE,"I am an admirer of Rachel Carson, and I also enjoy seeing documentaries from the early years of film and video.

This film is probably both an adaptation and a reaction to the historic book by Rachel Carson, ""The Sea Around Us"". Both the book and the film were made 10 years before ""Silent Spring"", the book that virtually launched the environmental movement. Carson's book treats the sea as an environmental wonder to be admired and loved. Her treatment is both poetic and scientifically accurate.

Ah, not so the film, produced and directed by Irwin Allen, the creator of ""Lost in Space"" and several disater films. It is about the competion for food and survival in addition to the many ways that sealife are able to be hunted and harvested by humans. It is amazing how much the film dwells on the riches of the sea that are destined to be main courses on our dinner tables. I should have guessed that Carson's book would have been hijacked, when the film started with a generous treatment of the Genesis Creation Story. And it is clear that the film did not go in the direction that Carson wanted to go and would continue to go with her subsequent books, such as ""Silent Spring"".

However... And this is a big however, I would HIGHLY recommend this film. It is after all a product of the first years of ocean documentaries, before the significant works of Jacques Yves Cousteau, such as ""World Without Sun"". The Irwin Allen film is misguided at times. But that does not take away from the beautiful scenes and descriptions (aside from how a particular animal is hunted and/or killed). The cover of the DVD shows a spear hunter!

This film should be in the library of every naturalist and lover of the sea. Of course, not for its often misguided point of view, but because that point of view is embedded in the attitudes that many people who fish, hunt and take life from the sea. We have to know how this misguided point of view gets to be part of the argument against conservation and environmental protection.

If this film is shown to children or students (or anyone who might not understand its provincial point of view), it should be explained to the viewer so that they can recognize its point of view and be able to argue against it. The scene of the whale hunt is particularly sad, given what we know almost happened to many ""right"" whales.

But not everything the film says is wrong. Just before the end, the narrator brings up the issue of global warming since 1900, saying that if all the ice of the world were to melt, the level of the sea would rise hundreds of feet. And now 60 year later, we are being faced with the first wave of such a prediction. The narrator asks, ""is this the end?"" And yes, it is the end of the film, and we see ""The End"". Somewhat of a cheesy way to end the film, but after all, consider the producer and the era.

Now, given the interesting legacy that Irwin Allen has made, such as ""Lost in Space"", we could bash this film as a horrible example of the worst kind of nature film. A parallel could be drawn with ""Song of the South"" the Disney film that is currently banned by Disney itself in the United States. Both films should be in our libraries, but with the proviso that viewing must be done with educated eyes.

So, strangely, I give this film a 5-star rating, but at the same time, I disagree with its ongoing theme of human beings' desire for mastery of the sea.",1304294400,2,3413,4.440894568690096
