7905966,5,0865976147,"This DVD program offers a comprehensive look at one of capitalism's most important figures. There is a good summary of Hayek's life and work: his prolific writings, the essence and scope of his thinking, his battles against socialism, his career both in the United States and Europe, and his crowning recognition, i.e., the Noble prize in economics. This DVD should get widespread distribution in classrooms, because once students see the actual man flesh-out on the screen, and they get an overview of his work, I think they'll be encourage to read his books and to develop a real respect for and commitment to capitalism. I recommend it for students, as well as for people of all ages.",1372982400,,687,4.880341880341881
