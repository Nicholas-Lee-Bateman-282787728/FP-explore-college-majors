491296,3,6302643457,"now if you are a GnR fan you will like this vidio.  The music is great but axle sounded a little if. But the best part to me was the solo of just duff,matt,and slash's talking guitar. This vidio wwas well worth buying and  I give it 3 starts because of the quality. It could've been better. If you  have seen a van halen vidio from hartford,conn...you would know why i have  it a 3",928108800,,381,4.04
491297,5,6302643457,"Probably the best live video I have seen. The band are tighter than ever, and Axl wins over the Tokyo croud like nothing I have ever seen. Matt proves he is the worlds best drummer, and Slash goes from one dirty riff to  another. Please reunite!",927331200,,245,4.326086956521739
7828918,4,6302643457,"I have to agree with both my fellow countrymen from NZ and say, first and foremost this is an excellent video as a part of a two vhs set, and while it may be expensive ( i know i paid around 120 for both) it is well worth it.
The video kicks off with a little backstage footage before axl appears onstage to kick things off with ""You could be mine"". I must be honest though, I thought axl really was off form, particuarly in the early songs. He wasn't hitting the high notes and his voice was far rougher than usual, in my opinion he butchered sweet child o' mine but yeah my opinion is EXACTLY that, an opinion. He did show plenty of energy however, which is the mark of a great frontman. The rest of the band were great though. Slash  in particular absolutely shredded everyone else on stage with his solos, many of which were improvised versions of the album cuts, which was nice... although i was dissapointed he did an improvisation on the big paradise city solo.
As has already been mentioned, may of the songs contain little intros or interludes, for example: In the middle of rocket queen axl starts rapping ""It tastes good don't it"". I certainly didn't appreciate that, many rock affectionados won't either, but it was certainly unexpected.
The Quality of the VHS itself, both visually and in the sound department was unprecedented for a vhs. It was crisp and clean (it was recorded officially by GNR of course) sound was excellent also, only a little behind DVD quality playback.
Overall this is an essential set to own, as as this VHS in particular, which contains most of, in my opinion, the gunners best stuff.
Buy it... hell buy them both.",1040428800,5,1653,4.51
7828919,5,6302643457,"As you start this historic video it shows you the band hangin out backstage and before the show.  I particularly like this part because it shows that GNR are human and not just some bad boy band that drank and have sex all the time.  And then after the kind of gloomy beginning (due to the song they played -- Breakdown) Axl and the band break into the ferious You Could Be Mine which the same recording is featured on Live Era.  The band keeps the intesity with an awesome drum solo that will still rattle your brain!  Then the greatest guitarist ever, Slash, breaks into an incredible display of notes and sounds that is still impossible for even the best of guitarist to imitate.  After the Godfather comes Sweet Child O Mine.  Now the only downfall of the entire tape (and the concert for that matter) was Axls vocals on Sweet Child O Mine.  But hey, hes been touring for so long you cant blame the guy.  After that the rip into another classic So Fine.  This track is so great even though it shows how the band was not all they say in their songs.  It says that Axl owns a favor to a friend and he points to Duff.  When really none of the band got along with Axl.  Then comes the second best track GNR ever recorded -- Rocket Queen.  This track had it all - blazing leads, hot ryhyms, even a rap section (lol).  Slash is the usual Slash going crazy and playing his heart out.  Gotta love him!  After that they go it Move To The City which is highly underatted.  Then comes the encore.  Knockin On Heavens Door is a classic song that was made incredible by GNR.  This version is about 10 minutes long and shows Slashs genious of the guitar.  Then comes simply the best track of all time (tied with Lynyrd Skynyrds Free Bird) Estranged.  The track shows the genious of Axl Rose and the beautiful music he created.  The guitars were perfect and the drums and bass was genious.  Dizzy created a beautiful mid way piano solo in the song followed by Slashs most memorible solo.  Then the band storms back on for their final blow out - Paradise City.  Axl goes all out on this.  And Slash runs around pratically in the crowd playing another well constructed and well thought out solo. And then as the final chord rings out and then band bows as you wonder, ""Will their ever been music better than this ever?""
Trust me.  If you are a fan or rap or regea or anything you will enjoy this historic concert.  It is sad that such an awesome band had to fizzle out of existense.  But their still is hope of a new GNR.  There is a new GNR band will only Axl remaining but I doubt they will ever be albe to touch the glory and wonder of the greatest band to exist.",1025481600,6,2653,4.248
7828920,5,6302643457,"If you like rock music you must have this. Great job catching a great concert on film. For VHS, it's pretty good.
This was filmed at the peak of GnR, so it doesn't get any better then this.
Make sure to also buy part 1 for the whole concert.",1008288000,2,241,3.938775510204082

7828923,5,6302643457,"This is the best music video I have ever seen. It has everything! Fantastic hardout solos, both in the guitar and drum catorgory. Slash adds his own intros to both Knockin' on Heavens Door and Paradise City before he  hooks into the song itself. Other good songs include Estranged and Sweet  Child o' Mine....infact it has all the legend songs. You aren't a pure Guns  n' Roses fan unless you have this video. My best bit is when Slash puts on  his tophat and sprints around of stage infront of the crowd...he knows how  to get the crowd going!",963187200,16,544,4.454545454545454
7828924,5,6302643457,it was awsome.with all the running around and action made fun to watch over and over. the drum solo was awsome and very long and how slash was running around down near the fans during paradise city was awsome. i wish i was there to see it in 1992.i thought how axl threw his stand was funny.it  was just so awsome.,957225600,3,314,4.147540983606557
7828925,5,6302643457,It's raw and sure the sound quality ain't great but damn it's fun to watch! ...Axl is just running around constantly (that's why he enjoys big stages)..it's quite a find for the big guns fan,943660800,9,190,4.457142857142857
7828926,1,6302643457,"and not a circus act.  How long can you stretch out a drum solo??  I went to the bathroom to throw up, and when I came back it still wasn't over.  How depressing to see such a talented band fall into the ""Bloated Elvis  Syndrom"". Spoiled to the point of overindulgence and it shows. The  stage is so big, that you rarely see the whole band all at one time or in  one spot, or for that matter anywhere near each other. They don't even seems  like a band anymore, but 5 seperate pieces floating around in nothingness.  What happened to the raw attitude they used to have. My grandmother would enjoy  this, but if your a die hard GNR fan, and you want to see them play as a  band, and not a circus act than go find a copy of ""Guns N Roses Live  at the Ritz 1988"". If your really a glutton for punishment Ill gladly  sell you mine.",934070400,,827,4.037037037037037
