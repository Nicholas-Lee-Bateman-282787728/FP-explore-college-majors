8190735,1,B000PDZ9PS,"This only presents (very) short interviews of the three victims of the duke lacross hate crime hoax and of one prosecutor who declared them innocent.  It never gives an extensiv presentation of the events that surrounded the case :  If you're not very familliar with this affair, you can hardly understand what went on from watching this DVD.  It's like you get only the last page of a book but not the whole story.

This is one of these ""read the small prints"" product.  The ""sixty minutes"" title is very misleading : in fact, the video last only 20 minutes but you won't know that unless you read very carefully (which I didn't) the product description. For this lenght, it's a very expensiv product and it's not even a well crafted report.

Frankly speaking, I ordered it all the way from europe and I feel this product is a complete rip off. Don't buy it.",1189728000,10,859,4.509677419354839
