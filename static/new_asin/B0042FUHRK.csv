4250803,4,B0042FUHRK,"This low-budget film definitely has more than a few elements from your typical B Grade movie, including a couple gooofy scenes and some dialogue cut way too short.  There are many more qualities, however, that make this movie one I would highly recommend viewing to see if you get the same eerie feeling that some important truths are actually touched upon during this entertaining romp towards the possible destruction of life on the planet.  The ideas of Stonehenge coming to life, energetic grid lines connecting major power spots from ancient civilizations, a brilliant ostricized scientist with revolutionary views unacceptable to mainstream thinkers (Copernicus and Galileo are aptly referred to in the movie, but many more from history could be added to the list.), and the current use of artifacts from the distant past all blended together to provide at least a very interesting possible scenario that defintely sparked my imagination.  The actors all do a remarkably fine job, delivering the lines of varying quality and completeness to the best of their ability, while the character interaction is at least fairly interesting, as best as the limited time and opportunity for the scriptwriter allows.  Some of the lines and scenes are actually very good and a pleasant surprise, as well as a stark contrast, to the mentioned shortcomings.  In conclusion, I definitely give this movie a qualified ""thumbs up"" and can only wish that a larger budget had provided those involved with the opportunity to have this movie receive not a low B but a solid A grade from me.",1336176000,,1573,5.057915057915058
4250804,3,B0042FUHRK,"I often wonder how much better these flicks would do with a bit more money and a tad better direction. The premise of some of these B-graders can actually be quite clever. Not as nearly as functionally complex as say '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code</a>', but certainly more creative than werewolves carrying magical machine guns that fire endless streams of bullets without reloading or British kids wielding magic wands.

Just sayin'.

'Stonehenge' is yet another in a long line of SciFi's 2012 doomsday themed flicks, with a bit of real history thrown in for good measure. And along with the plot, an okay script with reasonably believable dialogue. There are some clichs which are understandably unavoidable, but not so much as to make one cringe for the entirety of the ninety minutes of film.

Absolutely loved the use of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antikythera-Mechanism/dp/0306818612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antikythera Mechanism</a>. If a sharper screenwriter had utilized the actual known facts about the device and incorporated that into the story, possibly even gotten permission to film one of the amazing recreations, that would've earned a fourth star in my book.

But as it is - it's a decent piece of popcorn-munching scifi entertainment.

Enjoyed it for what was intended and what it delivered.",1332633600,2,1481,6.100961538461538
4250805,4,B0042FUHRK,"I enjoyed it after a fashion.  Not as good as some, but OK to put in the long list of SciFi movies.",1331683200,,99,3.5
4250806,5,B0042FUHRK,"very entertaining , always something going on and every one was fighting about this situation , just because they wanted to start a new life doesn't mean they are God, I did enjoy the movie",1323302400,,189,4.428571428571429
4250807,4,B0042FUHRK,"I think anyone who was a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan and enjoys watching cheesy low budget movies will get a kick out of this one.  The dialogue is especially bad, and, along with the unbelievably silly premise, it had me in stitches most of the time.  I never imagined in my life that I'd hear the words  ""nuke Stonehenge"" uttered together in absolute seriousness multiple times!  It was brilliantly bad in a fun, cheesy way.

Of all the actors, Misha Collins was definitely was the most enjoyable to watch, and he certainly gave the role his best, though his talents along with the others' are clearly wasted in this production. The eye candy he provides though definitely helped to make this flick much more easily endurable. Fans of his character Castiel from Supernatural will probably get a big kick out of seeing him dressed like Dean (I know I did!).

In short, I'd say if you're a fan of Misha or MST3K or just enjoy the occasional silly movie, this one is good buy for you.",1321833600,28,988,4.553672316384181
4250808,3,B0042FUHRK,"I am glad I only rented this one. I was stretching a little to even give it the 3 stars I gave it. Aside from the fact that it is just a bit too incredible, there are too many cliches here for me: the teacher/professor who instantly knows more about everything than the experts who have been studying the events, the clock counting down to zero, when the world will be destroyed, and the hero saving it at the last second- sorry if that's a spoiler, but if you don't have it figured out by halfway through the film, you don't watch many movies. Then there is a project going on 10,000 feet below ground level in Maine, USA, which has Egyptian Hieroglyphics involved. I don't mind this type of thing if there is even a tiny bit of explanation, but there was none. Add to this the fact that left hand drive vehicles were being used in England, and a U.S. Military Commander had an American Flag on his uniform backwards, and you are simply asking viewers to overlook too much.",1320192000,,974,4.357142857142857
4250809,4,B0042FUHRK,"As referred to in other reviews, this movie is piggy-backing on the recent crop of 2012 disaster movies.  That stated, and as my title implies, this was a missed opportunity by the producers.  If they had increased the budget for state-of-the-art special effects, put in a little more details, and expanded the script by about a 1/2 an hour or more, this could have been a major summer movie or, more probably, a better-than-average made-for-TV movie.

This is a good show with a good premise and your average, and sometimes better-than-average, acting by some TV actors: Micha Collins/""Supernatural"", Torri Higginson/""Stargate: Atlantis"", Hill Harper/""CSI: NY"" etc.

This is, also, one of the few efforts by the Syfy channel (I really hate that aconym) that is definitely worth a look and possibly a purchase.",1309046400,12,810,5.113636363636363
4250810,2,B0042FUHRK,"Man, what a downer. Got this because i'm a Misha Collins fan, but this is a weak film by almost any standard, with all its potential lost in bad writing, weak transition and squandered opportunities for suspense. Plot seems good in theory, with stonehenge revealed as some kind of ancient machine that is gearing up to terraform the planet...at the expense of killing mankind. But a subplot involving a cult leader is laughable, and the military response of attempting to nuke the ancient site to stop the end of the world seems straight out of a 50s black and white film. Rent it, don't buy it.",1299542400,12,595,4.622641509433962
4250811,3,B0042FUHRK,"This somewhat cheesy morality/disaster tale is enjoyable escapist fare.  The hidden pyramid is pretty effective while the others are typical low-budget fx.
Misha Collins (SUPERNATURAL) acquits himself well as the brilliant albeit ridiculed puzzle solver, but CSI NY's Hill Harper is surprisingly weak as the fanatical antagonist.
Some of the movie is incredulous, but typical for a SyFy channel offspring.  I would rent it or get it used on Amazon.",1298678400,2,448,5.385714285714286
4250812,4,B0042FUHRK,"The central theme of the film, prophetic words seem to come close to reality in 2012 after the discovery of a magnetic chamber, is not new.  However, no matter how used the concept is, the delivery of Stonehenge Apocalypse, is marvelous.

Conspiracy radio show host (and award winning physicist), Jacob, uncovers a series of magnetic disturbances AND learns that a group of tourists have been destroyed at Stonehenge.  For him, this is a clear call to GO to Henge and uncover what is going on.  Around the world, magnetic vortices are exhibiting dangerous signs (volcanic erruptions et al) and destroying Mexico, Malaysia, Egypt (Giza), and maybe Maine.  His mission, as he chooses to accept it, to stop the nuclear destruction of Stonehenge by a mad military leader before he can find the key to the disturbances and turn off the terra forming he suspects is going on!  Betrayal, action, transatlantic travel at light speed, and indoctrination through a series of revelatory discoveries makes this a National Treasure of Destruction.

Having said that, I liked it.  It is not factual, nor academy award material, but it is a good film that will make you appreciate the fact that even well intentioned films can still be passable.  SyFy is to be applauded for giving voice to films like these that can often be better than the high budget LOTR genres.

Thanks so much folks.

This is a standard disaster movie with all the correct characters playing all the correct parts with all the correct outcomes. So if you're into disaster movies this is an excellent example.

As with books you don't want to look at the last chapter to find out who did it. And its fun to kibitz as people are supposed to stay in the car.",1492473600,,568,4.6138613861386135

The plot was somewhat ridiculous (you can probably tell this from the movie poster), and combined with the bad lighting, shakey camera and getting to watch Misha Collins occasionally act like Castiel made for a great experience. It was the perfect blend of being a bad movie without trying too hard to be a bad movie and thus somehow pulled it off. Id definitely recommend watching it, especially if you're a fan of Misha Collins because I'd say he was a significant part of the movie's appeal.",1480723200,,602,4.4818181818181815

4250826,4,B0042FUHRK,I really liked the idea of this movie. I do wish that they would have elaborated a bit more on everything. Like before the electrical waves went off they could have sent teams to the other pyramids to find out for sure what was going on. Then report back. They could have showed more of the disasters the electrical waves were producing. It was enjoyable for me to watch. I really liked Misha Collins character. I also liked the lead female's character.

It's pseudo-science, paranoia and trope atop trope. Everything from the military's ""BOMB IT!"" attitude to the scientists' scorn of ""alternative theories"" is cheesy and overused in B-rated sci-fi. There's nothing particularly new here.

Now that I have that out of the way, I will fully admit that I like the movie. I don't love it, and it isn't a favorite, but I like it. The acting isn't horrible (though the writing could have used some work), and the plot is at least moderately fresh. There's nothing particularly new about the characters and, in fact, I could only remember the names of two of them by the end. The rest just didn't stand out. The protagonist (Misha Collins) and the antagonist (Hill Harper) were developed enough that the story could carry on with just the two of them. Collins was pretty good, though (I hate to say this because I adore him) a little flat. Harper was, I hope, supposed to be rather flat.

Here's the secret though. It's supposed to be a bad movie. It's a Syfy movie, and all Syfy movies are bad. Some are so bad that they're good. This one is, as my title says, among the best of the bad sci-fi. It's worth watching.",1425945600,2,1307,4.510548523206751

4250879,3,B0042FUHRK,"This movie is... I don't even know where to start to explain why I'm giving it three stars.  I watched it because it was commissioned for a Mark Watches video.  It was commissioned because of Misha Collins being the most wonderful man ever.

It fails science, history, common sense, and the ability to make sense to people with a brain cell count higher than their shoe size.  The ""plot"", such as it is, feels like they watched four episodes of Stargate at random and decided to mash them up.  Many of the characters are written so badly that the actors can't save them.

And yet... I was laughing from start to finish.  Had I taken Misha's advice and watched it drunk, I probably would have enjoyed it even more.  There are some legitimately good things - the acting, for one.  Not across the board, but Misha and Peter Wingfield were both their usual amazing selves, and aside from the accent, Torri Higginson was great.  (That accent, though... at least she knew it was terrible, they just didn't have the budget to get her any help.)

Overall, it's certainly no YOU MUST WATCH THIS movie.  But if you've had a rough day and just need something to let your brain take five, Stonehenge Apocalypse can do that for you - with some pretty, pretty eyecandy to boot.",1401321600,3,1263,4.539823008849558

4250899,5,B0042FUHRK,"An enjoyable ""what-if"" Sci-fi flick that plays fast and loose with science, history, and mysticism.

An undiscovered pyramid pops up in Waterside, Maine and leads to a race against time.  Can humanity be saved!?  Does the fate of the planet dangle from the hands of a crazy conspiracy theorist (Misha Collins)?  Will a pickle-puss doctor of stupidology (there can be only one.........Peter Wingfield) get out of everyone's way and allow the plot to move forward!?  Gasp!  What about the military and their need to nuke everything that crawls and them that don't!  Don't forget the backstabbing former friend (Hill Harper as the loony tunes chockfull of nuts archaeologist and his secret room with a doom) and his undercover mole who's an expert shot and willing to shoot anything that moves and them that don't!
I found this movie hilarious and vastly entertaining because of that.  If you're inclined to take any of it seriously, you're watching the wrong movie.  It's just another `end of the world' non-epic starring actors willing to put their reputations on the line just to provide us with a wee bit of distraction.  It's not art.  It's commerce.  I got exactly what I paid for.",1373155200,4,1184,4.894472361809045

4250902,5,B0042FUHRK,"Stonehenge Apocalypse is a great movie. I've watched it a few times already, and I'm wanting to buy it as soon as I can. It may not be Hollywood budget or anything like that, with expensive CGI or something, but it's a good movie in it's own right.

The actors were great. Even though the directing may have been bad, you can tell the actors were doing their best despite it. They wanted to make it a good movie. I'm a huge fan of Misha Collins, which is why I watched it in the first place. And I fell in love with it. I think I watched two or three times the first night I saw it, and then again the next day with my friend.

I would recommend this movie for people who enjoy a good laugh and a good plot and just want to relax end enjoy it. This is not for people who are hardcore movie critics and want to find  every bad thing about it just to make it sound like the absolute worst movie ever - Titanic 2 was the worst movie ever (me and my friends saw it, rented it thinking 'oh, this should be good. I mean..the first one was excellent', went home, watched it....and made fun of it the entire time)!

Anyway, to sum everything up: Pros - great movie, great actors, great plot, decent CGI. A must watch for Misha fans who want to see him stop another apocalypse as a human without the Winchesters. Cons - bad directing. Don't watch if you don't like movies that seem so bad they're good.",1363564800,2,1393,4.129151291512915

4250905,5,B0042FUHRK,"It's a film so bad that it's good. I'm glad I bought it and not just because of Misha(ALL HAIL THE OVERLORD). The Idea itself, no matter what u think of the occasional corny lines, is new and clever. They had a MUCH smaller budget than the big time movies and they made due. The special effects were OK, but I just LOVED the fact that they got to physically MAKE 60% of Stonehenge. The behind the scenes footage I always enjoy, seeing how they shot things so cleverly to not have everything special effects. The process of it's making looks like it was so much fun.

This film gave me a well needed break from my Sherlock feels (no one jumps off a building YAY!) and many other Fandom anxieties. :D

If you want to see Misha in action stopping a second Apocalypse (because once is never enough) then this is for you.

If you prefer watching nothing but things having Titanic sized emotional trauma, the special effects of Optimus Prime, or the poetic work of Shakespeare sonnets... just keep scrolling and leave this film to more worthy owners. You peasants.",1358035200,19,1058,4.5
4250906,2,B0042FUHRK,"I thought this one would be a lot of fun, but I was kind of disappointed.  It has a good cast, better than average for  low budget disaster movies, and the models for Stonehenge used are amazing.  I loved those.  What was disappointing was the slightly strange plot which didn't explain enough for my wishes but it involves aliens doing  construction similar to ""Chariot of the Gods"" for those who remember that book and it's ideas. They apparently built most of the famous temples and pyramids we know today.  Why those aliens would want to booby trap all of them for destruction of the earth  later is vague.  The special effects for the movie's other disaster sites  are disappointing.  Frankly, most of the good effects are shown almost in their entirety in the trailer, leaving not much for the movie except for long talk intervals in scientific rooms and empty fields and watching teams of scientists stare at computer screens in wonder as graphs and charts flash by.  The movie has more than its share of silly moments; ie,when  the heros  racing the clock for destruction DRIVE from New York to Maine rather than fly, etc.. Also the ancient temple  site found in Maine that pops out of the ground complete with statues etc. that never would have survived the movement, and  looking like a Mayan/Incan temple.  As far as I know, none of the Upper North American tribes used any such designs. I bought this disc very reasonably priced and it did keep my attention for it's running time, but, unless you have a real fondness for Stonehenge, I would suggest you just wait and watch this one on the SYFY channel.",1356912000,,1615,4.6537102473498235

Pyramids turning into volcanoes, archaeologist turned cult leader trying to destroy the world faster than whatever Stonehenge is doing.
