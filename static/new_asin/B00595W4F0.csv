8462722,5,B00595W4F0,"I gave it a 5/5 because not only did it get here quickly, but it was the best documentary I have ever watched. By the end of it, I was in tears. It was beautifully produced and and very informative. The packaging was very safe and clean. It brings several bonus features, such as the video for Bird Walk.
Would definitely recommend.",1392422400,,332,4.370967741935484
8462723,1,B00595W4F0,"I really don't get why so many people like this trash , all his songs are horrible , he's just a one hit wonder an everyone will forget this bastard soon hopefully",1327276800,3,163,4.125
8462724,5,B00595W4F0,"I saw this movie not expecting much, but I have to say, I was really impressed.  I'm not really a fan of Soulja Boy's music personally, but there is a lot more to the movie than that.  It's a fascinating look at how this young kid rocketed to the top, mainly through his own ingenuity and persistance.  He's a really interesting dude.  I would highly recommend this.",1319500800,5,366,4.417910447761194
8462725,5,B00595W4F0,"Peter Spirer does it again with this one. I personally haven't seen a documentary this well put together since Beef (also directed by Spirer). This is a must see for both new and old fans of Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. The film shows how the young artist literally went from rags to riches and you actually see this in real time. With Soulja Boy as the main focal point and his hilariousness shown throughout the documentary, this DVD is well worth the money especially for his fans.",1318896000,7,476,4.482758620689655
