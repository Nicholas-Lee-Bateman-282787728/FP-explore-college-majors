8048521,3,B0007LXONC,This TV movie has the gang infiltrating an island of assassins kept in check by deadly gas.  Lupin also seeks to find a killer who shot him with an identical model of his own Walther P38 pistol.  Average.,1508976000,,204,4.342105263157895
8048522,5,B0007LXONC,Quite possibly the best Lupin tv special of the 90's if not overall. This special moves with a great pace and a surprising amount of action and is more toned down and realistic than one might expect. Definitely highly recommend.,1501113600,,228,4.725
8048523,4,B0007LXONC,"Island of Assassins, released in Summer 1997, is the 9th Lupin the 3rd made for television movie. I was immediately struck by the quality of the animation in Island of Assassins. Its sometimes inconsistent but when its on the visuals are better than many of the other Lupin movies. The animation reminds me slightly of the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell although not to that level of quality.

Lupin ends up travelling to the titular Island of Assassins for reasons that becomes clearer later in the film but as is often the case he ends up finding a love interest. It seems that control is maintained over the assassin clan by use of a spider tattoo imprinted on all the members hands. The tattoos contain a venom that will kill any assassin who tries to leave the group. Unfortunately, Lupin is discovered and gets his own lethal tattoo forcing him into servitude. As always Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko have large roles in the film although Inspector Zenigatas appearances are almost completely isolated from the central story. This being a Lupin story it turns out the Assassins are sitting on a fortune in gold bars that Lupin and crew intend to purloin.

What I didn't love about the film was the general tone. Lupin films have had many directors each with his own vision. Hayao Miyazaki, for instance, made a very dignified but fun film with a tame, cheeky and clever Lupin. Regardless of whether one approves of Miyazakis vision of Lupin its hard to argue that the film isn't very well done. The director (or according to Wikipedia, two directors) of Island of Assassins had a much grimmer vision of Lupin. Lupin himself is still relatively lively and bold but the film itself contains more violence than most Lupin films. There was less fun and levity. The visuals were generally well animated but tended to be darker than in many of the previous films. We have a downbeat ending that concludes a rather dour story. I would call this a middle of the road Lupin film. Not the best but certainly not the worst. It excels mostly on its fluid animation but the story is just meh.",1438300800,,2082,4.654891304347826

8048525,5,B0007LXONC,"I love my Lupin III, but there's been a lot of it over a very long period of time, and without some variety, things can get stale.  The darker tone overall and bleaker outlook for some of the characters is surprisingly refreshing as opposed to disturbing or off-putting.  There's still plenty of what makes the series great, but there's also something a bit different.  It's much appreciated.

The sub-titles are good, as is the translation (I won't offer an opinion on the dubbing - I don't watch my anime dubbed), and for once I have little issue with Funimation changing the title of the film.  Since the original title, ""Walther P38"" or ""In Memory of Walther P38"", refers to Lupin's preferred sidearm and that sidearm also happens to be one that was standard issue during WWII to high level Nazis, most notably the Gestapo, I can see how leaving it as-is might be seen as being in poor taste.

The film is not without its minor problems, one of which being that we have yet another attempt to alter Lupin's character design, and, as usual, it's distracting at best.  Another being Funimation's traditional barebones extra features.  I doubt it would have killed them to throw in a short article on the history of the series along with a filmography or something.",1400716800,2,1266,4.6968325791855206
8048526,4,B0007LXONC,"It's a newer Lupin movie, but the plot isn't bad! I know, I know...impossible right? Island of Assassins was a very entertaining film and seems like it would be even if you're not a die hard Lupin fan. My biggest complaint is actually my biggest complain with other Lupin movies as well: not enough stealing! It seems as though Lupin and co. always start the film trying to steal something and then totally forget about by the end...still a good film.",1366416000,,451,4.580246913580247
8048527,5,B0007LXONC,I love all lupin's but this one has a nice flow of betrayal lust and murder.  Funimation is not the best company out there for anime as they prove again and again.  but i think they did ok on this,1269907200,,196,3.875

8048529,5,B0007LXONC,"Easily the best of the TV Specials and movies released by FUNi, if you can only get one Lupin movie this year, make it this one. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, other than the usual Lupin entertainment (which is always good, mind you), but what I got was the perfect blend of the dark undertone of early Lupin, yet all the sensitivity of Miyazaki's Lupin from 'Castle of Caglisotro'. And better yet, my main man Mr. Strait wrote the English adaption WONDERFULLY. Not with the same 'throw away' gags that FUNimation often likes to do, but with truly impressive dialogue, complimented greatly by his voice for Lupin. Forget the mispronouncing of Lupin's name, it's easily ignored. The video and audio were excellent, as usual. With Japanese and English on the DVD. I'd only ask now that we got other Dubs, too. I love seeing how different voice actors from all over the planet play these classic characters. But the special features aren't really. . . Special. But I'm sure the Japanese release didn't come with a commentary, which I'd love to hear.

Anywho, to wrap it up, great movie, good dub, sub-par special features. . But they don't really matter anyhow.",1124582400,6,1182,4.737864077669903
8048530,5,B0007LXONC,"Island of Assassins, or In Memory of the Walther P-38 as it was originally called, is not the typical mostly-comedic Lupin film. This one has a darker and more series tone, but there is excellent comedy subtly sprinkled throughout the movie.

The animation is fluid, the character designs are different, but it doesn't take long to get used to them, and the action is plenty.

In this movie, Lupin finds himself going to the hidden Island of Assassins after his old, stolen Walther P-38 gun is used by someone in an assassin group to shoot Zenigata.

This island is also rumored to contain massive amounts of gold, so naturally, Lupin and crew go after that. But there's more going on at the island, and Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko find themselves right in the middle of a huge plot that divides the residence of the island down the middle.

We also get to learn about Lupin's past from his pre-Jigen years in this movie.

I loved this special! It was very engaging and with excellent pacing and fluid animation. Character designs didn't bother me at all, and I loved how it ended.

The man female character in this movie, other than Fujiko, is Ellen. I thought Ellen was an excellent character. I loved how she was introduced and how her character developed throughout the movie.

As for the DVD itself, the transfer was excellent. The video looked good and clean with no defects, and the audio was also great. The viewer could choose from English 5.1, English 2.0, and Japanese 2.0. There are dubtitles for the English track, and subtitles for the Japanese track, so be sure to choose the right one. The dub, asides from pronouncing Lupin's and Jigen's name incorrectly, was also done well.

Highly recommended. AnimeOnDVD gave this movie a grade of A, and I do as well. Don't even hesitate and pick this one up.",1114214400,10,1819,4.6802507836990594
