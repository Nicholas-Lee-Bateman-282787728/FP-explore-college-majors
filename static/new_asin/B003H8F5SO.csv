4124605,2,B003H8F5SO,"A decent movie on its own but has nothing to do with the other two movies--The Christmas Shoes and The Christmas Blessing. There is not even a mention of the boy turned physician Nathan or his father Jack. No Rob Lowe. No connection whatsoever to the other story lines! I would have much preferred this movie to follow the previous movies with atleast some of the same characters. Again, a good enough movie (and I love Christmas movies!) but this should just not have been marketed as a sequel to the other two. The only thing that is similar is some of the background music! Other than that, there is no relation to the other two movies.",1448841600,,639,4.47008547008547

4124694,4,B003H8F5SO,"Wonderful movie well worth watching! However, think of it as a separate movie from Christmas Shoes and Christmas Blessing because it does not relate to the other two. It was a heartfelt movie about family, love, hope, and rebirth.",1358726400,,230,4.923076923076923

4124702,5,B003H8F5SO,"The last of the Christmas Shooes triology.  Just as sad, but the Christmas spirit prevails as always and has a good ending.  Family friendly, too.",1356998400,,146,4.8
4124703,3,B003H8F5SO,"The plot of this movie is really about grief.  As a social worker ends ups caring for a young girl who has just lost her Mother in an unexpected accident.  The social worker lost her own son about two years before and so she has a lot of grieving that she is still going through.  In fact, she and her husband are even feeling the strain on their marriage since they have both been grieving and just wish the ""pain would go away.""  For anyone who has lost someone close to them, that expression alone will echo in their own hearts.  Through a series of events the healing process begins for all involved and they are able to enjoy Christmas.  The main flaw I see in the movie is that at first it is hard to follow who is who.  And the acting in the beginning is a little unemotional and uninvolved.  I will say that all of the female actresses in the movie have massive quantities of very beautiful hair. So in closing, the movie is a good one for those who have experienced grief.  As far as being a good movie in and of itself, it has a lot of potential.  But I do think the lackluster acting in the beginning is a drawback.",1356048000,,1126,4.171296296296297
4124704,4,B003H8F5SO,"Madeleine Stowe makes this movie, she's the only reason to watch it! This is very much a Hallmark movie, easily guessed plot twists but still nice for the holidays",1353801600,,163,4.655172413793103

4124706,5,B003H8F5SO,"I just got this movie yesterday and loved it.  Christmas can be a very difficult time for a lot of people.  Especially someone who has lost a person very dear to them.  This movie helps a hurting person heal in a very unusual way.  You never know who or what will fall into your life to help you see things clearly.  Anyone with a heart will love watching this movie.  The characters are real people with real feelings and hearts.  They could be any of us who are watching.  It gives a whole new meaning to ""life goes on!""",1333584000,7,522,4.202020202020202
4124707,5,B003H8F5SO,This was a great movie with a great theme.  Lesser-known actors did a great job.  Goes beyond simply a chick flick.  Good for the family.,1330819200,4,137,4.4
4124708,5,B003H8F5SO,This is an excellent Christmas movie for the entire family to watch. A follow up to two earlier movies Christmas Shoes and Christmas Blessing. Should have all three of these movies,1326844800,2,180,4.838709677419355
4124719,5,B003H8F5SO,"This movie is terrific, it ties in with the first two movies Christmas Shoes and I believe Christmas Blessing.  You can not go wrong if you get all three and watch them together, but each story can stand on its own also.",1326758400,2,220,4.238095238095238
4124720,5,B003H8F5SO,"Upon arriving at home this year to visit my parents, they had this movie waiting for us to watch with them.  They had not seen it yet, and suffice it to say.... it was riveting.  A beautiful message, but bring the kleenex box... or 2.  This is very  much a tear-jerker (yes, even for the men).  I highly recommend this as a yearly Christmas classic, which is why I just ordered it! Basic storyline (without giving too much away) is a girl comes to live with a social worker and her husband at Christmastime and through this relationship, all lives are healed just in time for Christmas. :)",1324944000,3,589,4.416666666666667
4124721,3,B003H8F5SO,"The Christmas hope movie is by my perception expected to be based on a series of three Books based on characters from Christmas Shoes and Christmas blessing and new characters.  The movie is just o.k for me.  I read the books first before viewing the movies.  I was disappointed on how the movie was not true to the books, the actors were different from the previous movies and did not even fit the physical description of the other books and stories.  The story was a bit changed.  For example, in the book:
Emily is five years old and not nine.
Justin is a lot younger and story line is completely different in the book.
I do not want to spoil the plot for other viewers, so I will end this review with this. In the movie, no way is Nathan's dad, step mom, and the lawyer is mentioned.  Important characters in the books.  I highly recommend reading the books vs seeing the movies.  Books are much more detailed and beautifully written.",1322524800,8,938,4.444444444444445

4124725,4,B003H8F5SO,"Really enjoyed this movie. This is the third in a series. I love the Christmas Shoes and really like how they tied all three together.

We have ordered all three through Amazon and have had great success finding movies on here when we can not find them at the stores. The shipping was fast and I always order over $25 so I can save on the shipping. I have also done some surveys which gives me a discount on my purchases. It is always great to work with Amazon.",1297728000,,461,4.179775280898877

BTW, have a box of tissue next to you because it is a tear jerker (especially if you've ever lost anyone close to you).",1297036800,,260,4.0588235294117645

Christmas Hope was a little more than that, thanks to the stellar acting chops of Madeleine Stowe and James Remar. Very enjoyable, and brought a lump to the throat a couple of times.",1512259200,,302,4.716981132075472
