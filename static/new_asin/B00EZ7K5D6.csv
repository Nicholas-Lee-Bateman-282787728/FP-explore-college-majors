8610718,5,B00EZ7K5D6,This Dance Workout is beyond awesome! Yesenia has the most pleasant personality as well as teaching skills. I absolutely love dance and this is one of my favorite of all dance workouts. Hoping that she continues to make more!!!,1497225600,,227,4.846153846153846
8610719,5,B00EZ7K5D6,"I never get bored with this! I would use it in addition to my salsa classes, to improve dancing and practicing. Being married to someone who does not like to dance, this CD is my only way to practice :-)",1473379200,,203,4.1
8610720,3,B00EZ7K5D6,"Didn't love. I was hoping to learn a few salsa moves and then lots of practice in a workout format, but over half the video is learning steps. By the time I got to the workout I had forgotten a lot of the moves and couldn't keep up. In my opinion, not for beginners (unless you are a natural dancer) and if you aren't a beginner you wouldn't need all the instructional steps anyway. I would prefer learning a few steps, using them in workout format, then learning a few more, practicing them and so on.  Disclaimer I only tried the video once and got discouraged. Maybe it's great for others.",1431043200,,592,4.333333333333333
8610721,5,B00EZ7K5D6,"Yesenia Adame introduces her new workout program, Salsa Dance Fitness Party. Cuban salsa is energizing and full of flirty and elegant movement without a partner.
Before beginning the program, Yesenia welcomes the viewer and introduces the program. Live musicians perform during the program, and one of the musicians gives a brief lesson on how to count beats in salsa.
The warm up begins with easy shoulder and head rolls large torso rotations and pelvic circles. Total body undulations, lunges, and squats are next, and a bit intense if you are a beginner or haven't exercised in awhile.
The movement catalogue is extensive and includes the following and more movements before beginning the combinations.
 the basic
 the basic with taps
 cumbia
 corner checks
 right turn with styling
 cross and side taps
 tap flicks
 pop and twist
 suzy q
 grapevine with kicks
 quick, quick slow
 flares
  left turn
 basic with a cha cha step
 hip hits
 rock step with jump push
 slide with hip hits
 two hops
Five combinations to live music follow and a cool down.
I enjoy dancing salsa and  have used Yesenias previous programs. I found it would be easier to follow the movement with less crowding on the dance floor. Practicing the movement breakdown section will speed up the build up in tempo in order to get workout benefits. Overall, lots of great movement to learn and once pieced together, fun and very good exercise.",1393632000,6,1413,4.881856540084388
