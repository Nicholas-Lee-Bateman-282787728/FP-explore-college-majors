8151936,4,B000JLTRBI,"The five volumes in FOX HOME VIDEO's PERFECT DATE MOVIES all have a ""Love & ____"" theme. The four titles in each set are on individual discs and presented in widescreen format. Quality of the transfers is excellent. Provided extras are those typical of full-priced, single release DVDs: commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, ""making of"" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, etc.

This penultimate edition is highlighted by a Coen brothers comedy. Also included are a comic spy caper, a shrink with his own issues, and a one-man good cop/bad cop movie.

SYNOPSES for PDM #4 (Love & Laughter)--

THE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE--  An internal power struggle at the CIA and some false information embroils an innocent airport arrival in a game of deadly espionage-- all because he was spotted wearing two different color shoes. An outstanding cast (including Laverne & Shirley's 'Squiggy') struggles through a weak script.

ME, MYSELF & IRENE--  A cop with a dual-personality disorder falls in love with a female fugitive he's transporting from Rhode Island to upstate NY. After misplacing his medication, the mild-mannered officer's evil alterego takes over. Things worsen when a group of corrupt policemen begin stalking him and his charge.

NINE MONTHS--  A child psychologist who suffers from a commitment phobia panics when he learns his longtime girlfriend is pregnant. Story follows a predictable ""break-up and make-up"" path. Supporting cast includes four relatives of director/screenwriter Chris Columbus.

RAISING ARIZONA--  An unlikely couple (ex-cop and ex-con) are unable to conceive, so they steal one of a furniture tycoon's quints. Having to contend with a rough-looking bounty hunter as well as scheming friends and co-workers makes life utter chaos for the kidnappers. By far the best movie in this collection. Directed by Joel Coen (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"").
