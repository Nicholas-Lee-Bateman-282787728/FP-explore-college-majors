1779480,5,B00006JE1R,My hubby and I do Yoga together.  This DVD was the absolute best that we have ever done.  It has sat in our netflix queue forever because we keep doing it over and over again.  It is better than Rodney Yee and Candlelight Yoga.  I love that man's voice as he narrates the Yoga moves.  The back twists are excellent stretches.  The very end with the meditation is awesome!!!  I would defintely recommend this to others especially to beginners.,1301961600,,442,4.518987341772152
1779481,4,B00006JE1R,"My daughter suggested this dvd for all around health.  I also had arthroscopic knee surgery.  This yoga practice which I do 3-4 times a week is terrific for strength in all areas of the body.  I especially wanted something for strength in my knee.  It has not disappointed so far.  It has made a difference for when I bike, walk or play tennis.  I can feel the strength in my legs and knees.  I am nearing 60 so I need all the help with strength and bone density.  I use to use it from ROKU, but decided to buy a dvd to make it easier to put on and to travel with.",1279843200,5,564,3.9732142857142856
1779482,5,B00006JE1R,I have been using this video for the past 7 years together with a friend.  We find it great as it gives a deep yoga workout that helps various parts of our bodies.  I was very happy to find a copy for myself that I can keep in my own home.,1274400000,,239,3.6666666666666665
1779483,5,B00006JE1R,I've been doing Yoga with this product for 7 days now and noticed a difference in the way I feel almost immediatelly.  My clothes fit better and I breathe better and digestion problems are much improved.  I'm thinking about buying some more to vary the routine.,1173312000,3,261,4.6521739130434785
1779484,3,B00006JE1R,"Lisa and Charles have a beautiful energy together, and although this DVD may be appropriate for those with some experience in yoga, or with fairly good health, I cannot imagine people with some of the 'common condiditons' they mention doing this series without struggles or perhaps injury. (I teach in medical settings, am an RN and a Registered Yoga Teacher). For example, many Type II Diabetics (most common type), and others who are overweight or hypertensive might be better off sitting on a chair to start with vs. the ground. They mention sitting on a pillow or a book-without addressing common difficulties such as knee pain or arthritis (more common in people with overweight), or how to transition from pose to pose. And downward-facing dog?? It is a good pose for stretching out various parts of the body, but there are so many others that can get you there, and the stress on the wrists and shoulders without detailed instructions can be great. Too many forward-folds without modifications often lead to dizziness...I'm sure that with the experience these teachers have, and with the hundreds of asana poses there are, they could've come up with something more creative and health-promoting than Sun Salutations!

Although they do mention the importance of doing modifications several times, they don't show progressive steps or the modifications. I have noticed that most people will imitate the teacher in classes, our common human tendency to strive and 'look right' rather than follow our own body's messages. This is mostly a physical (hatha) yoga practice, rather than focusing on healing and the integration of breath and awareness in the practice. These teachers seem kind and well-intentioned and their joint effort is nice to see, but I did find it distracting at times, especially with eyes closed, to be listening to a female voice, then after a moment of silence a male voice chimes in and vice versa.

Also, I cannot imagine my 84 yr. old mother-in-law, who is a yoga practitioner, doing this series, nor the majority of the cancer survivors that I have worked with. It is too fast. You would be better off handing this DVD to a beginner with some yoga experience in their 20s to 40s, and using one of Lilias Folan's such as Yoga Gets Better with Age or Healing Yoga by Joseph LePage for anyone aging, or with a 'common condition'.",1173052800,51,2356,4.902255639097745
1779485,5,B00006JE1R,This tape is faboulous. It makes your body feel good especially with all the stretching involved. I would recommend this to anyone.,1140825600,10,131,5.0
1779486,5,B00006JE1R,"As I turned 40 I began noticing arthritic aches in my knees, ankles and back.  This kept my motivation down to exercise to feel fit.  My thoughts turned to yoga as a way to condition my body and reduce the aches and stiffness.  Onset diabetes is a concern of mine, also, because of family history. Some videos were too strenuous or fast for me.  This video, along with Healing Yoga for Aches and Pains, renewed my excitement and motivation to exercise.  I reviewed tapes from my library, but kept returning to these two time and again.  After a couple of weeks I can really feel the difference.  The couple on the tape have soothing voices without sounding like they're trying to contrive a mystical effect.  I, also, like the way it is broken up into 3 different parts.  I work the tape as a whole, but I can see how time constraints or energy would make the shorter sessions ideal.",1112054400,7,883,4.46875
1779487,3,B00006JE1R,"I was disappointed in this tape and a companion tape ""Healing Yoga for Aches & Pains.""  They are nothing more than beginning tapes.  I was looking for specific recommendations/instructions for specific problems which they did not provide, but newcomers to Yoga might find some basic information of value.",1038700800,10,304,5.3125
1779508,5,B00006JE1R,"I have enjoyed this dvd so much!  At 65 years old, my back will feel uncomfortable at times.  When I do this relaxing, stretching video, I feel so much better.",1367798400,,159,4.266666666666667
1779509,5,B00006JE1R,"I started doing Yoga and I needed a good beginning place to start. This is it and it is really enjoyable and doable, however it is a good workout too!",1344211200,,150,4.033333333333333
1779510,5,B00006JE1R,I love it. Easy and very relaxing. I discovered this on Netflix and got hooked. Not strenuous and makes me feel relaxed for the rest if the day. I bought this as a gift for my mom and friends. Their instructions are very encouraging and tips are very helpful.,1333929600,,259,4.3061224489795915
1779511,5,B00006JE1R,"I have been into yoga for several years now but could never find a routine I could stick with. Either the routine was not challenging enough or I was dripping with sweat and completely out of breath when I was finished. Either way is not very good. I stumbled across this wonderful video, like so many others, on netflix instant stream. I was in love right away. I don't have ""common conditions"" like other people have mentioned, such as fibromyalgia or joint problems but that doesn't matter. This routine is great for relaxing and a gentle workout. You get great stretching and are able to keep the breath flowing. I am able to do this routine and feel absolutely wonderful when I am done. I am not out of breath and my body feels awakened and revitalized. The meditation at the end is so perfect and it really helps relieve stress and anxiety. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Even if you are out of shape and have many health problems you can do this video with a little patience and understanding. The key is to not push your body. You just try your best and keep at it everyday and before you know it you will be doing every pose with ease.",1331683200,,1154,4.397196261682243
1779512,5,B00006JE1R,"I would certainly elect to order from this company again.  Everything went perfectly, and the merchandise was exactly as advertised.",1326758400,,132,5.6
1779513,5,B00006JE1R,"DVD was in perfect condition, brand new, and came quickly. It was for my mom. She was happy it came quickly :)",1314921600,,110,4.045454545454546
1779514,5,B00006JE1R,"I first watched this DVD on Netflix's instant stream and used it nearly every day for months but soon discovered that I needed to own it. It's a low-key, easy to follow Yoga routine for beginners, or those who have mobility issues. When I first started watching this DVD, I couldn't bend, let alone touch my toes. A few months into it, I could touch my toes and even do the inverted V! Another thing I like is that there are no inside jokes, the instructors are straight-forward and to the point, often reminded the viewer why certain poses are good for the body. I am very pleased and hope to continue to build strength and mobility in my body with this DVD.",1308441600,6,659,4.365853658536586
1779515,5,B00006JE1R,"I am 28, overweight, and was recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after two years of pain.  I have been doing this DVD through Netflix Instant, but decided to go ahead and buy it because I use this several times a week.  I tried their video for aches & pains and it wasn't challenging enough for me, but this video is just right.  I have done some yoga in the past, but would still call myself a beginner.  This video gives me a good, gentle strengthening workout while helping to stretch and relax my joints.  I find my hands and feet are less stiff and less painful in the morning if I did this video the night before.  My diabetic 60 year old mother who has had back surgery, breast cancer, and knee surgery, all in the last 2 years, is also able to do this video, so the reviewer who said this was too difficult for people with ""common conditions"" shouldn't generalize so much.",1307750400,4,889,4.390243902439025
1779516,5,B00006JE1R,"I do this yoga practice 5 days a week. It has really helped with my fibromyalgia, chronic muscle tension, and anxiety. I would recommend this exercise to most everyone. If you have or are prone to back injury, you may have to skip some exercises, but otherwise this is a great routine that is not too challenging. It really helps to unwind your body and mind.",1304208000,,359,4.454545454545454
7970040,5,B00006JE1R,"This routine has helped keep up my core strength and chase away aches and pains, especially in my back and neck.",1497744000,,112,4.380952380952381
7970041,5,B00006JE1R,Great exercise.,1494633600,,15,7.0
7970042,5,B00006JE1R,Love this. I wish they still made the one for arthritis.,1484092800,,56,4.181818181818182
7970043,3,B00006JE1R,This DVD is slightly difficult for someone just beginning to treat their pain.,1481673600,,78,5.076923076923077
7970044,5,B00006JE1R,great yoga program.  Not too hard and stressful,1452038400,,47,4.875
7970045,5,B00006JE1R,"Easy, beginner yoga / light workout. Great for aches/pains.",1433980800,,59,5.666666666666667
7970046,5,B00006JE1R,So easy when you are in pain.  I feel better every time I use this video,1433289600,,72,3.5
7970047,3,B00006JE1R,I used it a few times and it was fine but I am not one for exercising much. Then I gave it to a neighbor with back problems. However I need to rate Amazon 1 star for their horrible treatment of their employees.,1432252800,,210,3.9069767441860463
7970048,5,B00006JE1R,"A few years ago I used this workout on Netflix.  Netflix removed all fitness DVD's a while ago and I have missed this one terribly.
I've tried taking Yoga classes at a few different studios, but really missed the convenience of having a DVD available at home to workout according to my schedule.
I was thrilled when I found this online.....it is great if you have any type of digestive issues....really works on the common conditions as it states in the title.
I've already seen success with my flexibility since beginning the workouts again.",1403481600,,542,4.76595744680851
7970049,5,B00006JE1R,"This is a great video for a beginner. I'm in my late 50's and a type 2 diabetic, and doing this workout has helped to bring my blood sugar down more than anything else I have done (interval training, walking, weights). While I will continue to do all of these activities, this video is great for the in between days when I don't lift.  I signed up for classes a few months ago at a local yoga place and found the routines to be way too hard. I couldn't even do a lot of them. This video is a perfect intro to yoga. I also found a used copy for $23 so you don't have to pay full price, look for other sellers.",1385164800,2,608,3.9430894308943087
