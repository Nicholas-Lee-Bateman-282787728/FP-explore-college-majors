2526621,5,B000EOTTS6,"This show was the best of all time, and always will be. The writing was the most original and interesting ever created in the history of television, and anyone who watches this show will find it hard to find anything better. Most people reading these reviews probably already know how great Northern Exposure is, so the one thing that I think is important to say is that SOME of the music is different. Many people have complained that the music has been changed - and these complaints are indeed warranted. The music in the shows was deliberately choosen to convey important emotional and cerebral experiences by the viewer / listener. But, many people have ignored the fact that alot of the music has NOT changed!! For proof of this, just look at the official soundtrack recordings on CD, and then really pay attention to the shows. Many songs are still there. Why not just have an open mind and try out the new music anyway, its not like the just replaced it all with Kenny G or Yanni!",1151452800,13,988,4.556179775280899
2526622,5,B000EOTTS6,"OK, this is how it should have been done from the outset.  For those who either don't know or don't remember, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was originally a summer replacement show, beginning to run only a couple of weeks after TWIN PEAKS in 1990.  That first summer season ran 8 episodes and the following spring the second season ran for 7 episodes, meaning that Seasons One and Two run to a grand total of 15 episodes.  Despite this, the first two seasons were originally released as separate box sets but priced as much as full single seasons.  It was one of the most overpriced pair of sets in the relatively short history of DVDs.  No sane person would have considered buying them (I rented from Netflix).  Now, however, sane people can consider getting the first two seasons.  I already own Seasons Three and Four, and now I can add Seasons One and Two.

Before saying a couple of things about the seasons, let me say that people who complain about the soundtrack really need to . . . I apologize beforehand for any impoliteness here . . . shut up!!!  Look, music substitution is just going to be part of the future from here on out in TV shows coming out on DVD.  There is simply no way around it.  Or rather, if you want to blame someone, blame ASCAP and BMI and RIAA.  Here is the real deal:  as long as these folks continue to exact such huge royalties for the use of songs, we are going to get vastly less expensive songs substituted for the original ones.  There is simply no way around it.  The makers of the DVDs have two choices:  substitute music and sell the sets at reasonable prices or use the original music and sell the sets at absurdly high prices.  Want to pay $100 per season of NORTHERN EXPOSURE?  Well, neither do I.  But to get the original music that is what it is going to cost.  So, the choice really is substituting music or paying through the nose for our DVDs.  This is the very reason why ALLY McBEAL may never some out on DVD.  That show was written too tightly to particular songs to enable substitution.  Right now they are unable to come up with pricing that makes it possible to bring it out on DVD.  Someday?  Maybe.  But until such nonproductive entities as I mentioned above (especially RIAA), who own rights but really don't do anything for anyone that matters, especially the artists, start bringing the fees charged down to a reasonable level, substitution is going to be the standard practice.

What gets me about NORTHERN EXPOSURE is how quickly it found itself.  The surrealism that graced so many episodes would only come with the second season, but the atmosphere of weirdness took place almost immediately.  In the first episode, it was at first Joel Fleischman who seemed a bit weird, as he bored some innocent fellow passenger on his flight to Alaska.  But as soon as he was dropped off at the bus stop on his way to Cicely and was picked up by Ed Chigliak, he was one of the least eccentric residents of the town.  The show made adjustments.  Holling and Shelly were not at first as prominent as they later would be; Chris hadn't quite found himself as the spiritual voice of Cicely; Maggie wasn't yet as odd as she would become; and Peg Phillips as Ruth-Anne wasn't yet a permanent cast member.  Still, as shows go, this one was pretty much in Season One the show we would know later.  By Season Two, it was pretty much the show it would be through the first five seasons.

One of my preoccupations in watching television has been the ways shows handle narrative.  After HILL STREET BLUES in the early 1980s, the mark of most of what has come to be known by TV theorists as Quality TV shows has been multiple, ongoing narrative threads.  Especially after advances in TV narrative by TWIN PEAKS and THE X-FILES, both of which overlapped with NORTHERN EXPOSURE, narratives were not merely multi-threaded but long term.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE may have been the last Quality TV show to feature almost exclusively stand-alone episodes that resolve all or most of the story arcs with each episode.  Especially after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (1997-2003) virtually all Quality TV shows feature long and multiple story arcs (though popular with audiences, few critics or TV theorists have considered any of the shows in the LAW AND ORDER or CSI franchises Quality TV, but as regressions to an earlier period in TV history).  One mark of more narratively complex shows is that they have to be shown in a particular order.  For instance, you couldn't take an episode of Season Two of BUFFY and put it in Season Four.  Although NORTHERN EXPOSURE does not utilize multiple story arcs or use long narrative, it does share this feature for the most part with other Quality TV shows.  Although the DVDs frequently reorder the episodes compared with the original airing dates, frequent mention is made to previous episodes.  It is an interesting way NORTHERN EXPOSURE varies from other shows structured around stand-alone episodes.

This really is a very special television show, with one of the best collection of characters in the history of TV.  I've told friends that while I have shows I like more, like BUFFY and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and ANGEL and FARSCAPE, if I had like the characters in PLEASANTVILLE enter a TV world and live there, my choice would definitely be Cicely.  These are characters I've come to love and care about in a way that differs from any other collection of characters.  And now that they have repackaged the first two seasons in saner fashion, any sane individual who wants to own them can.",1146873600,245,5543,4.631147540983607
2526623,5,B000EOTTS6,"I had previously purchased seasons one and two separately and wish they had this option then. You get both seasons one and two for less than the price of season one's issue price alone. I recommend you buy this set if you are a Northern Exposure fan or are just discovering the series. Seasons one and two contain some of my favorite episodes and begin to establish the characters and provide the basic information about the dynamics of Cicely Alaska that will help you enjoy the later seasons. My favorite episodes in these first seasons include: The Series Pilot; Brains, Know how and Native Intelligence; The Aurora Borealis; The Big Kiss and Spring Break. Here is a brief description of all episodes, enjoy!

Season One

1.1 One-Hour Pilot

Dr. Joel Flesichman, an inveterate New Yorker, arrives in Alaska with plans to fulfill his medical school financing obligation by practicing in metropolitan Anchorage. However, he is quickly informed that his services are not needed in Anchorage, but in a small, remote village by the name of Cicely.

1.2 Brains, Know-How and Native Intelligence

While Joel is struggling with evergrowing frustration over faulty plumbing in his cabin, he sensitively deals with Ed's uncle Anku, a proud but ill medicine man who is reluctant to embrace modern medicine.

1.3 Soapy Sanderson

After the passing of one of Cicely's most-loved eccentrics, Soapy Sanderson, Joel and Maggie battle over the proper handling of his one hundred acres of land, left to them in his will.

1.4 Dreams, Schemes and Putting Greens

Holling gets cold feet and leaves a pregnant Shelly at the altar, while Joel and Maurice try to make a deal with visiting Japanese businessmen to build a resort in Cicely.

1.5 The Russian Flu

A flu epidemic sweeps through Cicely and threatens to ruin Joel's romantic weekend with his visiting fiancee, Elaine.

1.6 Sex, Lies and Ed's Tapes

Holling and Shelly are caught off guard when Shelly's husband Wayne, a nineteen-year-old hockey player, arrives in town asking for a divorce. Meanwhile, Ed struggles to write a Hollywood blockbuster movie.

1.7 A Kodiak Moment

While Maurice ponders life and death after his only brother passes away, Joel and Maggie administer childbirth classes to a group of native Alaskans in a neighboring remote village. Meanwhile, Holling finds out that ""Jesse the Bear"" has been sighted and vows to take care of him, once and for all.

1.8 The Aurora Borealis (A Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups)

Joel learns of the legend of ""Adam,"" a Bigfoot-like creature who walks the woods outside of Cicely. Meanwhile, Chris bonds with a black traveler passing through town, who turns out to be the brother he never knew he had, literally.

Season Two

2.1 Goodbye to All That

Joel receives a ""Dear John"" letter from his fiancee Elaine, while Holling's gift to Shelly -- a satellite dish -- turns her into a TV addict.

2.2 The Big Kiss

A wise Indian spirit helps Ed in his search to find his parents, while Chris loses his voice to a mysterious beautiful woman.

2.3 All is Vanity

Maggie tries to win her father's approval by pretending that Joel, a successful doctor, is her boyfriend. Meanwhile, Holling contemplates circumcision to please Shelly.

2.4 What I Did for Love

Joel thinks twice about a scheduled visit to New York when Maggie dreams of a plane crash and the townspeople take exceptionally well to his substitute, a Jewish doctor from New York. However, the similarities between the two end there. Dr. Gingsberg (guest star Leo Geter), a strapping blond man with an engaging smile, charms the residents of Cicely immediately, leaving Joel feeling jealous.

2.5 Spring Break

Temporary madness sweeps through Cicely as the townfolk await the ice meltdown and the arrival of spring. [MC: Running of the Bulls.]

2.6 War and Peace

Passages from War and Peace are woven into the lives of Cicely's residents and visitors, who experience Tolstoyesque nightmares and Dostoyevskian passions, when old friend Nikolai arrives in town. Maurice is the only one who is not happy with his arrival. [This is the epsiode where they ""break the fourth wall"" out of character, they discuss the script and move on.]

2.7 Slow Dance

The curse of Maggie has struck again and poor Rick is the victim of ""death by falling satellite."" Ron and Erick arrive and buy the Inn. Holling meets up with an old friend and Shelly feels like a third wheel.

And P.S. don't listen to the naysayers about the original music issue you will read in the reviews for the other seasons that have been released. There is nothing that can be done about that now and the series still beats anything released in the past ten years. The writing and acting is superb! You will love it!

Once we saw all of them together, it was clear the writers had ideas about how the whole show should go, and it unfolds beautifully.  The pilot introduces each character but Chris (who is introduced as the first element of the second episode) beautifully as well.  ALL the music is NOT missing, as some reviewers have said.

I just ordered Season 3. I really love the episode ROOTS.
where Adam starts cooking at the Cafe, and psychoanalyzing Dr Joel Fleischman and Maggie.
I hope Miriam Makeba's Emabhaceni is at the ending, I loved it so much I bought her album,
but if it isn't--I feel sure that they wouldn't cut out the opening dream scene with those wonderful African dancers.

2526690,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is not a show that people reminisce about like MASH or Cheers or even Seinfeld.  I think the reason for this is because people were not ready for a show like this at that time.  Today we have become avid viewers of epic tv series, but this show was just too good for its own good.  It was also on rather late at night, but if you have an appreciation for truly smart storytelling you must give this show a try.

2526691,4,B000EOTTS6,"For some time I wanted to purchase this series, but considering the price for the number of episodes I waited.  Simply because of happenstance I ran into a post holiday pricing and picked up the firts two seasons.  I had read about the trouble with music that was irritaing to most and this also kept me from purchasing.  I forgot about when I saw the great price.  The original music is playing on menu and credits;as far as the music in the episodes themselves, well I did not notice it until I read the reviews again.  I'm sure all the offerings have the same problem with having the original music substituted, but until being rememinded I was uneffected.  Now I am thinking about it alot, crazy.
  As far as the series, the stories, characters, and the quirky, lovable nature that threads it's way thru, I am taken back to to the first time I saw it and vowed to never miss an episode.  I am very pleased to have the first two seasons and will look for deals or used copies for futher purchases.  Few series consistently brought this level of story telling, character portrayal and sincerity to the naturw of things.  A wonderful spiritual journey into the human condition and how we relate and need each other regardless of who, where, why, etc... has brought us together..wonderful!",1390435200,,1289,4.609649122807017

2526694,4,B000EOTTS6,The primary purpose of the introductions was to set the stage and introduce the characters. The writers accomplished this task with competence. After a few romps in the woods the characters and their idiocynchracies were well enough set to carry them through the entire series.  A better than average start for a run of amusing situations.,1390262400,,339,5.053571428571429

I have watched seasons 1 and 2 and probably 90% of the orignal music is intact. To be honest with you, if I hadn't read the reviews, I would not be able to tell any difference.

I liked this one and would like to see its return, or something along those lines with basic, human entertainment; no model wannabees; guys digging for gold in Alaska and the jungle; people trying to survive with ridiculous games and eating bugs for survival; fear factors; and finding fortunes in storage lockers and pawn shops.

I have been unable to find it on any of the streaming sites so we decided to purchase the DVD versions. We were impressed with the sound and picture quality. The DVD's were new and unopened with really nice art work on the cover for the set and each DVD.

It brought back some great memories for us both to watch season 1 & 2. What's really cool is getting know all the cast again, we had forgotten a lot of the details and watching took us back.

I plan to order the remaining seasons because now we are looking forward to specific episodes that we remember. It's almost like watching old home movies and seeing  friends from times gone by. Thanks for the memories.",1346112000,3,765,4.335664335664336

2526730,5,B000EOTTS6,"If you shop around locally, you can find these for a lot less without having to wait for a parcel carrier.
I just picked up seasons 1 thru 4 for a lot less than amazon is selling them for here.
However, I have not seen seasons 5 and 6 where I have shopped. I will probably get only season 5 whenever I see it for the lowest price and stop right there.

The show was not as interesting once the producers/creators decided to write out the role of Dr. Fleischman.
His role was the original purpose of the show. As the only doctor in the little town, he was the important catalyst for the show's stories as he interacted with all of the characters in the fictional town of Cicely. His role drove the whole show.
But from what I understood, his role was minimized due to a contract dispute with the actor who plays Dr. Fleischman.
The creators later got a dose of their own medicine when they were successfully sued by a man who claimed that the idea for the show was orginally his. Karma.

Whoa! Just purchased Season 5 here at amazon for a great price. However, this show lost its original creators and executive producers for this season, Brand and Falsey, and the 5th season really lost its luster. I never cared for the last season, so I will not be collecting it.
The actor who plays the doctor is really subdued here. Like he had a lobotomy or something. Not the same feisty young man that started this great series. Even the lighting of the show is darker.
The first 4 seasons are definitely now the best. They were very light and cheery. Very funny with excellent writing throughout.

2526735,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is impossible to forget; even though the show only ran from 1990 until 1995 it is still as fresh and imaginative now as it was then. The stories, the characters, the settings and the music make this series truly memorable.

The story focuses on the character of Joel Fleischman, played by Rob Morrow, who had recently completed his studies to be a medical doctor by way of a scholarship from the State of Alaska. The payback for the State of Alaska is the scholarship required that Dr. Fleischman serve for four years as a doctor in that state. This is the story of the events surrounding his arrival in Alaska and his discovery of where he would actually serve out his time there.

One gets the feeling that the closest Dr. Joel Fleischman had come to the wild was a stroll through Central Park and possibly a visit to the Bronx Zoo. Now he finds himself in what is for him, a totally alien environment to which he must somehow adapt. On top of all that he encounters some remarkably rugged individuals who will now populate his life in ways he couldn't even previously imagine.

This set of the complete first and second seasons are a joy to watch and have good sound and picture quality. This is funny and fun family fare and I recommend it highly.",1308441600,2,1269,4.508695652173913

2526748,5,B000EOTTS6,"There have been a lot of television shows that have come and gone and whether you have seen this series, or not, one thing can be said is that this show has developed a cult following on its own. With television shows that take place in small fictional communities, Northern Exposure is just one of those very few that have defied expectations.

Northern Exposure is an ensemble show that was produced back in the nineties and featured such notable stars as John Corbett, Barry Corbin, Janine Turner, Rob Morrow (Num3ers), Peg Phillips (7th Heaven), Adam Arkin, Anthony Edwards (Top Gun, E.R.) and Floyd Westerman (Walker, Texas Ranger). The series also welcomed a slew of guest stars through its six year run.

For those that might be confused as to why the first two seasons had a small episode count, be mindful that the series was a summer replacement series for CBS at that time. It would gain a regular placement for the following 1991-92 season but was also limited to a certain number of episodes by the studio. When the series returned for a third season, Northern Exposure would get a full season worth of episodes that would last through the end of the series.

Originally, the series focused on the character of Joel Fleischman, who was portrayed by Rob Morrow (Num3ers). When Rob Morrow ran into contract negotiations with the studio in an effort to improve his contract, network execs decided to switch the focus from Rob Morrow and opted to focus more on the other characters, giving the series more of an ensemble look. Eventually, Rob Morrow would leave the show, resolving the situation of Joel Fleischman and give the series a different direction, focusing ecven more of the characters of Cicely, Alaska. The series would go into freefall after Rob Morrow's departure from the series and is considered the least favourite season of the entire series.

Overall, I have watched through the series several times and while the final season does seem to lack that friendly atmosphere that Rob Morrow provided, the entire series is a pretty decent one. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. And, with this re-released budgeted set of Season 1 and 2, look forward to the remaining seasons being released in this lower-priced format. I can't recommend this series fast enough and if you're looking for a quality show to watch, then this is the right one for you.",1267315200,30,2419,4.835748792270532

The town is thrilled to have a doctor, the doctor who thought he was going to be in Anchorage is not so pleased.  So how to make the doctor happy?  How to treat patients with no equipment?  The interesting story develops with the town residents trying to live their lives and go forward while their doctor is waiting until he can leave.  Strangely enough, everyone gets used to each other and begins to enjoy their lives as best as possible.  I have to admire how well plowed the streets are in this town and how sunny it is most of the time.  I wonder where it was really filmed.

2526757,5,B000EOTTS6,"A serious comedy about just about anything of importance to human nature.  As one of the tags say, intelligent, and very funny while being very honest.  This series isn't about Alaska or small towns, it is about human nature and the whole, huge, world we live in.
Dr. Joel Fleischman, played by Rob Morrow, is trapped in a town in Alaska that he finds offbeat, strange, and, sometimes, dangerous.  Many of the characters you will learn to love as Chris the DJ, played by the amazing John Corbett.  There is also Holling as 62 year old the bartender, played by the calm and mild John Cullum, along with Maurice played by the, somewhat over the top, Barry Corbin.  And there is Ed, the want to be filmmaker in search of his roots and a good story, played by Darren E. Burrows who happens to be the best character in the series.  Well, to me anyway.  And the beautiful Maggie, the bush pilot played by Janine Turner, who has the boyfriend curse.
There are others, of course.  The one episode Adam, Rick the fifth boyfriend, and others.  None of them are really minor characters yet few are major.  Even Doctor Fleischman sometimes seems to be in the background, almost part of the audience, trying to understand the logic that is Cicely, Alaska.
While there are two seasons the total number of episodes are 15, as it was kind of a filler when it first came out.  I am also not sure CBS was sure of the humor and didn't foresee it becoming a hit.
It has tons of extras in the form of deleted scenes and unused footage.  The best part is now I have been to Alaska a couple of times I know, and have been, to the cities they are talking about and understand some of the background.",1246924800,3,1675,4.385113268608414

I spent three days there and fell in love with the place. It is a charming town with warm, friendly, welcoming people. While again watching years one and two of the Northern Exposure series, I can definitely see the similarities in the real Talkeetna and Cicely. Watching the series is even more fun this time around, after getting to know the area and the people on which it is based. All the actors do a terrific job in the series, the story lines are delightful and could be real, the scenery is gorgeous, and the buildings and settings are similar to the real places, except for the street, which is much too wide. The real Talkeetna main street is more narrow. Overall, the series is a wonderful experience. Watching the episodes makes me want to return to Talkeetna again! I highly recommend the entire series.

I've gone into ""The Brick"" (no matter what town, they all have a ""Brick"") from the cold, snow, and slush and walked into a warm, uniquely friendly place where everyone knows everyone else and their business.  Good food, always hot coffee, and cold beer.
Northern Exposure reminds me so much of a compilation of all these small towns scattered across the northern U.S. it's a ton of fun to watch.  I feel while Northern Exposure is not an exact portrayal of small towns, and the viewer has to use a little imagination, the basic feel of the people and their lives is there.

2526778,5,B000EOTTS6,"There is something about this show that reaches you on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level like nothing else currently on television ... or even, for that matter, modern literature. When I watch Northern Exposure, I think of what the poet Terrence said - ""I am a man. Nothing human is alien to me"". Well that is the show.

It's all about this experience we are all going through. What it means to be human. Mankind in its diverse shades co-existing on this all too large blue marble in the sky.

Northern Exposure gave me so many moments of pause, of joy, of smiling sadness, of deep thought, that I know and feel that I am a better person because of it. It both enriches and entertains. And that is powerful!

In this age where it seems everything conspires to tear us all apart, to isolate us, to scare us, where small town community is portrayed in post-apocalyptic shows like Jericho (highly recommended viewing by the way), and Mother Nature has us all on the run, that somewhere beyond the sea, and over the rainbow, North to Alaska, is Cicely, waiting to be found, visited, explored, and loved over and over again.

If any of the writers and creators of Northern Exposure ever read this, I want to tell you that you did good. You did really good.

2526781,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is a virtual treasure trove of psychological and mythological insight. As commentators have often mentioned, connections to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell abound, both of whom are quite often conspicuously brought to mind by either express reference or indirect allusion. These connections can be followed by reading some of the material mentioned in the various narratives of the series and thereby discovering the practically unending depth and sophistication of many of the episodes. In my opinion the second and third seasons are the best, but all are well worth repeated viewing. I will not go into detail on specific episodes or try to give a synopsis of the whole, but rather list some associations of the characters in the series with personages and themes of Gnosticism that I have found which might help to shed some light on what is going on under the immediately visible surface. The theme of Northern Exposure, as I see it, is based on a Jungian/Campbellian inspired vision of how we as contemporary viewers can use the psychological and mythological insights of Gnosticism presented in the images of the series to help us find meaning in the everyday gnostic events we experience in our own lives, thereby helping us achieve some kind of spiritual growth and, just maybe, eventually leading to our own internal revivification, i.e., the metaphorical ""virgin birth.""

Joel Fleischman, the Jewish doctor (healer), is mythologically, symbolically and phonetically associated with Yoel of the Gnostic texts, another Jewish healer better known as Yeshua or Jesus, whose sign is the fish (Yoel fisherman). Joel, while being initiated into the mysteries of existence as manifested in the human condition--Cicely, Alaska style--serves as our unwitting spiritual guide on the journey of Jungian individuation and spiritual realization. When we meet Joel he is 28, making him around 33 at the time of the completion of his quest, the age Yeshua was said to be at his end. Realization, by the way, is brought about by the transformative knowledge (gnosis) that human existence is an uncanny mystery (i.e. something like Socratic knowledge of ignorance), not by means of faith in the historical accuracy of supposed supernatural events, reduced, as Campbell liked to say, to a ""newspaper report.""

Mary Margaret O'Connell (Maggie) is Joel's companion on this gnostic quest (like Mary Magdalene, with whom Mary Margaret is obviously phonetically linked, was for Yoel in the Gnostic tradition) and serves as the catalyst for his transformation--just as each sex serves as the mystical other for its opposite, knowledge of whom in some strange way serves as one of the keys to spiritual wholeness.  Adam and Eve are of course Adam and Eve, whose insolence and hubris are obvious enough in various episodes, but who, in Gnosticism, are not ""responsible"" for the benighted, lost and alienated condition of humanity.  Thus the origins of the primeval couple are at first a stupefying mystery, but, when we find out the truth about Adam and Eve in ""Our Wedding"" (a magnificent episode from season 3 that is inexhaustible of this stuff), things are not what we thought they were as taught by the institutional tradition. The other characters, with the exceptions of Maurice and Chris, would then of course be the apostles. Maurice is a kind of mild mannered Yaldabaoth,  responsible for creating things as they are (he secured Joel's services and virtually owns the town) but unable to control everything, though, like Yaldabaoth the head archon, he would like to.

This brings us to Chris, who in many ways is the keystone to the Gnostic interpretation of Northern Exposure, for he is the end towards which the others ascend. Chris can be viewed as someone who has realized what Joel is unknowingly searching for: the Christ within. Chris is the same age as Joel and Maggie and in many ways is the measure by which we can view their development. Having previously been a criminal but now reborn (internally resurrected--see the episode ""Crime and Punishment,"" season 4), Chris, by virtue of the metaphorical virgin birth or spiritual realization in life, serves as a guide for others on how they too might realize the Christ within, by means of compassion, self-knowledge and spiritual honesty. Thus Joel is to Jesus as Chris is to Christ. Jesus is the physical, empirical component in Gnostic soteriology; Christ (Autogenes,  literally ""self-begotten"") is the spiritual, metaphysical component. It is not an accident that after Joel leaves Alaska Maggie ends up with Chris, who is waiting as her spiritual mate following her transformation resulting from her initiation into the mysteries with Joel, who served as the physical catalyst for her spiritual awakening. It is only after Maggie receives salvific gnosis--which results in the transcendence of her past troubled relationships with men--that she can enter into her proper identity, no longer in a ""relationship"" (ego to ego), but rather in her own individuated identity, which now includes the male archetype as part of her Self--that Self being the divine feminine, the very source of wisdom and life, Mary Magdalene.

This interpretation of Northern Exposure as a Jungian/Campbellian version of Gnosticism cast in a contemporary mold is neither complete nor exactly symmetrical, and it is not presented here as the gospel of Northern Exposure by any means; but hopefully it can serve as a skeleton key which might help to deepen appreciation and understanding of what is going on at some of the more esoteric levels of this marvelous series. There are certainly many other archetypes which could be delineated, but I think this Gnostic characterization is an overarching theme in the series that opens the door to more discoveries. Just try following some of the gnostic allusions in Northern Exposure; in doing so you will find that if you put forth a little effort and use your imagination the results will be magical in the alchemist's sense of the word.",1181606400,9,6030,5.139653414882773

The first disc would load and then the DVD player would say ""no disc""  The second disc would load and then it made so much noise in the player that we could not use it.  The DVD was sent back to Amazon.  I am very disappointed, as this is the first time I have ever had to have something returned.  My son and daughter-in-law bought it for me for Xmas, and I also purchased it for a friend.  The discs my friend received played with no problem.  So frustrating---told my daughter-in-law to just return it.  Am not going through all the hassle of sending it back and forth.",1168300800,10,625,4.237288135593221
2526804,4,B000EOTTS6,This was great.  I had really been wanting to revisit this series and was not disappointed with the the quality of the content.  The only down side is the number of episodes per season.  Seasons 3 and 4 have each had as many or more episodes as 1 and 2 together.,1168300800,,262,4.098039215686274
2526805,3,B000EOTTS6,After reading the reviews of this show I thought I would love it. It was very disappointing. Joel's character is rather annoying and the acting from all the actors is rather blah. The only highlight is John Corbet!!,1168300800,,215,4.684210526315789
2526806,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is one of my favorite shows and it was so nice to get to go back to Cicely Alaska and see Joel and Chris in the morning, before they became big stars.  The acting in this series is the best!  Such unique characters!  If you are a Northern Exposure fan or you've never seen it before, but your a fan of Rob Morrow, you need to get this series.  You'll love it!!",1168300800,,378,4.0675675675675675
2526807,5,B000EOTTS6,"I have always been a fan of Northen Exposure. It broke my heart to watch the series finale. So I can only say to watch the DVD's is like returning to old friends. In this world of clone-like structure, it's nice to be able to visit this diverse and unconditionally accepting town. If only for an hour at a time.",1168214400,,311,4.2
2526808,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is an oddball amoungst TV shows before and after its run.  It took on real issues (race relations, cultural stereotypes, politics, philosophy, sex, art, aging, you name it) in a sweet, funny but head on and honest way that was truly TV genius.  Every episode begins by setting up 2-4 sub-plots that would all be neatly and uniquely resolved and made whole by the end of each one hour show.  The characters were as originally and creativly drawn as any of any TV show ever brought to prime time. But I believe the real attraction to this show (and my personal reason for loving it) was in the strangely surreal feeling of the town and its people that was so subtly but powerfully created by the writers and actors.  I wanted to live in Cicely because it was obviously the most intersting, beautiful and unique place on the face of the planet.  I wanted to hang out at Roslyn's Cafe and eat burgers and drink beer with the sweet natured yet burly logger types that were always there.  I wanted to call into the ""Chris in the Morning"" radio show and trade deep thoughts with Chris.  I wanted to punch Maurice in the mouth, dance on the old shop keepers grave with her, and talk old movies and music with Ed.  But mostly I wanted to make it with Maggie, she was as sexy a female lead as any show ever had yet always unobtainable for the Joel in all of us men.  The characters were all richly excentric but at the same time so real and likeable.  Their problems were at first weird and often silly but ultimately always something I could personally relate to and see in myself.  The last 2-3 minutes of every episode was typically my favorite piece of each show when the different story lines would come together in a sweetly comical and usually philisophical way to sum up that episodes theme, with an always beautifully well matched musical piece to take us into the Alaskan sunset.  I wanted to live there, even though I knew that this place and these residents were straight out of an adult version of a Dr. Suess story or some odd parallel universe, Cicely was a good and real and enriching place to be, and I was able to live there one hour a week for several grateful years.  I never watched an episode without having a smile on my face and a sense of calm in my heart at the end.  I apologize if this review is a bit to syrupy or emotionally connected to the likes of a mere TV show, but this one was special and deserves to be seen by anyone who enjoys excellent writing, acting and story telling, but most of all it is a wonderful way to go to a strangely beautiful and human make-believe place for just an hour.  I'm still looking for Cicely, and if I ever find it I'm setting down roots and staying until Maggie gives in and Ed comes to dance on my grave.

The early seasons (1-3, maybe also 4) are the best, with the freshest writing and story lines.  As happens with many good long running shows, Northern Exposure began to struggle to come up with creative story lines and fresh new characters after the 3rd or 4th season, and by the last season, without Joel there for the other characters to connect to and conflict with, the series began to feel forced and clearly outlived its welcome.  View seasons 1 & 2 and I'm sure you will become a true believer, you will want the whole set.  Cicely, Alaska is out there somewhere and you'll want to find it too.",1167955200,11,3383,4.36682615629984
2526809,5,B000EOTTS6,"I really liked this series about an unusual small town and its inhabitants. If not for its success, we would never have seen the likes of Monk, Eureka, House, etc. Check it out if you've never seen it.",1162425600,6,201,4.315789473684211
2526810,5,B000EOTTS6,"The bottom line is that if you love Northern Exposure, you will love this DVD. For years reruns were televised on A&E and the Hallmark channel, luckily about the time they stopped televising them these DVDs came out. This is one of the best shows out there. Lately they have put every nonsense show ever televised. It is good to see this one produced on DVD. I have never watched an episode that didn't make me feel better than I did before I watched it.",1158624000,10,454,4.352941176470588
2526811,5,B000EOTTS6,"I didn't have a TV when this show aired. I missed a revolution in television in which shows exercised story arcs which took more than a week or two to complete (cliffhanger sweeps week specials). Now, they're commonplace. In 1990 ... it was daring. And this series deserved the gamble. Watch the ""Soapy Sanderson"" episode, you'll see.

Renting seasons 1 and 2 last year, I saw clearly that the production team set up a situation with the ""fish out of water"" Joel, his ""love at first dislike"" sparring partner Maggie, and all the other idiosyncratic supporting characters ... then took careful time milking the milieu ... and ended up with a touching lover story. Joel and Maggie's thawing out ... but also Joel's relationship with Cicely, Alaska. Joel thinking that, as a young, talented doctor, he's got life figured out ... over the episodes, we see clearly that he's clueless.

It's not even dated. Looks as new now as it did in 1990.

It's a great price these seasons, and if you watch from the pilot to the end of season 2, you'll realize that this series had spark, magic, and heart. Go ahead, give Northern Exposure an encore.",1157760000,18,1133,4.683417085427136
2526812,4,B000EOTTS6,"The pricing of this and other Northern exposure seasons seem to vary a lot. I bought season 1&2 at $19.99. At this moment it is $29.99. I ordered season 3 at $29.99, then within the hour I was fortunate enough to notice that the price was $19.99, so I removed the higher priced season from my order and then reordered. Hold out for the lower price!",1156550400,26,348,4.287878787878788
2526813,5,B000EOTTS6,"Northern Exposure is tv with heart and a brain. It was a series that made me feel that there are still good things and good people and meaning in this world. The quirky characters, the humour and the magic realism make it worthwhile art (even the soundtrack is a pleasure). The final season didn't have the crispness of those that preceded it-- the writers had been changed and it showed. However the whole series is still worth watching.",1154044800,2,438,4.628205128205129
2526814,4,B000EOTTS6,"Well, it wasn't exactly the ""out-there"" dramedy we remembered - but it was still some great television.  It was great value for money (we looked at other websites and could not find a deal like this for 2 seasons bundled together, let alone 1 season) and we enjoyed the quality of the DVDs themselves (sometimes the picture on TV to DVD isn't that great).

It was the material itself that was somewhat dated.  I just remember walking in on my mother watching the show and thinking ""What IS this show?"" because it was simply soooo out there.  Still, there are still some great one liners and the actors are fantastic - we'll definitely get Seasons 3 and 4.",1153267200,3,655,4.52542372881356
