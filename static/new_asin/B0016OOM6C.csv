8263779,2,B0016OOM6C,"I'm very tolerable of car racing movies, because well if you've got hott carz and some eye candy, who really needs a story?! Unfortunately,  the Asylum went the opposite way with this film: no eye candy or hott carz (except for the customized WRX & the GTR which you only see about 5 minutes of in the final race), and a pathetic excuse of a clich storyline. And this isn't one of those good/bad Asylum films where they spoof and make fun of themselves.  This was an apparent attempt to make an actual race movie.

Acting from the lead actor was actually quite good for a B-movie (which is why I'm giving 2-stars instead of one) but everyone else was pretty wooden and/or awful. Best movie line: ""I don't race ricers"" said to the main character while he's driving a completely stock BMW. Maybe in the original script he was supposed to be in a Civic w/a hideous body kit and lime green paint? Who knowz!

Definitely,  NOT recommended.",1516060800,,934,4.502958579881657

8263782,3,B0016OOM6C,"A B movie .... fast and furious wanna be .... but worth the view.  I collect car dvd's ... 107 to date, and I am glad that I added it to my collection .... however if you want first rate acting, this misses the mark.  If you like to see cars racing, and going fast .... you won't be disappointed.  Decent story line .... I liked it!",1415836800,,332,3.925373134328358
8263783,5,B0016OOM6C,"Just as I expected couldn't be any better. It was just as described and worked correctly was a small problem with the sound with thte music on the start up screen, but music is always loud in movies",1393200000,,198,4.2368421052631575
8263784,1,B0016OOM6C,"very cliche and predictable, script was horrible, acting was horrible, also funny how they tried matching a scion xb up agains a 5 series bmw and make it seem like a close race...pretty bad",1344384000,,189,4.588235294117647
8263785,2,B0016OOM6C,"Pros:

-- Story's uninspired, but not so bad. Same goes for cinematography and direction.

-- Lead actor playing ""Johnny"" is trying so hard to be Brad Pitt, it's almost charming. You'll find yourself saying, ""Aww, look at the guy trying to be Brad Pitt...""

-- I love this guy ""Red,"" the auto junkyard owner who trains Johnny in racing. He's so authentically and simultaneously grizzled and whimsical, you'll think he's the child of an unholy union between Nick Nolte and Michael J. Pollard.

-- The actor who plays rival racer ""Mickey Stiles"" must have been coked up throughout the film shoot. No one's that good an actor. But it works. Keep this actor on coke. (BTW, IMDb says he's the freakin' voice of ""Putt Putt"" from my kids' video games!)

Cons:

-- The racing scenes are so obviously shot in fast motion you'll half expect Boots Randolph's ""Yakety Sax"" to be playing in the background.

-- But you won't hear ""Yakety Sax"" because the same nondescript hip-hop song, which consists of nobody rappers yelling, ""WHAT AROUND HERE!"" over and over, underscores every race. As if it means something. But it doesn't.

-- Are Daniel's father and sister somebody's relatives or friends? Actors this bad and ugly don't get cast without knowing a producer or somebody.

-- Helicopter turn-by-turn in the last race comes out of nowhere with no explanation, while the view from helicopter shows no race at all, just some highway traffic. Who are they? Radio traffic reporters? Cops? And why do they talk like surfer dudes?

-- Final, climactic racing scene comes and goes so quickly, you won't even realize it, because it consists almost entirely of close-ups of drivers yelling, ""Come on! Come on!""

-- Bad guy parole officer is so suitable a douebag that you'll want him to really get it at the end. But when it finally happens, you won't stop laughing. Really, hours later, you won't stop laughing.

Final verdict: I bought ""Street Racer"" for a buck from a Blockbuster that was going out of business, knowing full well that stocking movies like this helped put Blockbuster out of business. It was worth a buck and 90 minutes of my time. It will be on a blanket in my driveway at my next tag sale.",1327708800,,2192,4.724409448818897
8263786,1,B0016OOM6C,What can I say about this movie other than it really sucks. Acting is worse than Highschool play. Based on a true story? Yeah right. Complete B.S.,1237161600,,146,4.444444444444445

8263788,2,B0016OOM6C,"If you're a Gear Head like me, you probably were thinking about renting this Movie for two reasons: 1.the Name of the Movie or 2.the Cars on the Cover...or both.  Which Brings me to my First MAJOR Flaw with the movie.
the Cars on the DVD Cover are NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIE!!??  This Movie was Not COMPLETELY Horrible for a ""B"" Movie.  the Storyline or Plot of the Movie was actually not that bad.  I think the Biggest Problem with this movie was probably a Small Budget.  With a Larger Budget they Could have hired some Well known Actors, and a Director that knows how to weed out Cheesy Dialogue and ACTUALLY HAS A CLUE ABOUT CARS!!??
They Obviously had NO Budget because all the Cars except one in the Movie are BONE STOCK!!  Anyone who is into cars would not ride around in a Bone Stock Looking Vehicle, especially not one with HUB CAPS!?  In one of the early races in the Movie a Totally Stock Scion XB Races a BMW with an M5 motor and it's a Close Race??? COME ON?!  The BMW would have left the XB in the Dust!!  Even if the XB motor was Modified, it still wouldn't have even been a challenge for the BMW!?
It's stuff like this that makes this Movie a REAL Disappointment.  For Car Guys like me, the Cool Cars in the Movie are Just as Important as a Good Plot!  So unless you're COMPLETELY CLUELESS about Cars, or You've got a thing for ""B"" Movie Actors, wait until this movie hits the DOLLAR SHELF at your Local Video Store before renting.",1228867200,2,1442,4.245421245421245
