Though it's recorded for Pal systems (Europe and muddies east) this DVD is region Zero which is perfect, I have no problem playing it on my NTSC blue ray.",1439856000,2,223,4.090909090909091

7997381,5,B0000AIT8G,"This set of videos from the wonderful artist Sandra Cretu is perfect for watching at anytime I love all her videos and music style.

Having this collection is proof of good taste, I just can't find anything bad to say about it, the lush backdrops and idyllic scenes starring Sandra and her vocals are what really made this the best it can be for me, I even showed it and get good response about it from friends hanging at home. Getting this is a dream come true, the direction and synchronization are all top notch and stylish, will be hoping for another set like this in the future. Recommended...

7997383,5,B0000AIT8G,"From the moment I heard 'I'll Never be Maria Magdelena' I have been a devoted Fan, Sandra has some of the best pop songs I have in my cd music collection, so it made sense when I saw the complete History on Dvd I had to have this, some of the video's have breathtaking scenary, some have an important point to make such as 'Johnny Wanna Live', In which the fur trade is booming, through the using of animal skins. Definately food for thought, makes you think about cruelty toward Animals.  All the songs that I came to love Sandra for are here, perfect for Your Sandra Collection. To those who are unsure of Sandra's work, her beginning happend when at the age of 13 she got up on stage at the end of a Young Star Festival, she performed A song called 'Andy Mein Freund'. In 1979 she become lead singer of a group called Arabesques, after Nine Albums, sandra left sighting musical differences. She went on to record a song called 'Japan 1st Weit' With Michael Cretu. Her Solo Albums Include The Long Play, Mirrors, Into A Secret Land, Painting In Yellow, Close To Seven, Fading Shades, Wheel Of Time, Art Of Love And Back To Love. All the Singles up until Forever, from Wheel Of Time Are featured on this Dvd. Also Included is a cover Of 'Everlasting Love'. Sandra is also featured as a vocalist for Enigma. No songs from Enigma are featured on this Dvd, 'But Take Me Don't Break Me' and 'Marigot Bay' from Arabesque, Also 'Stop For A Minute' from the crime series Tatort. Her popularity at the end of the 80's in Europe, rivaled Madonna. My only gripe about this dvd is the interviews are in German and subtitles should be available for those who don't know German.",1246060800,2,1666,4.444444444444445
7997384,5,B0000AIT8G,"I have been a fan of Sandra's music for many years, and it was a delight to to be able to own all of her video clips on DVD format for the first time. The video and sound quality is acceptable by today's standards, although a newly mixed soundtrack would have made it perfect (only 2ch stereo is available). The DVD bonuses are great, and although some people complain about them, there is much more than one can find in similar titles by other artists. There are 2 live/TV performances of the ""Arabesque"" days, and 2 audio tracks sung in German that have never been available in digital format before (as far as I know): ""Andy Mein Freund"" (credited as Sandra Ann, at age 13), and ""Japan Ist Weit"" (a cover of Alphaville's Big In Japan), Sandra's first solo recording after she left Arabesque. There is also a ""commentary"" option where Sandra talks briefly before each video and she even shows some of the costumes she wore in the videos. And to make it fun for the fans there is a quiz too with a hidden video as the prize. My copy was made in EU and it is PAL region 0, playable in many regular DVD players (if not, play it in your PC!).",1223337600,5,1140,4.306976744186047
7997385,5,B0000AIT8G,"I am a rock music fan, but bought this DVD for my wife!  My wife writes:

Every song that Sandra is famous for is in this DVD. Every song that any fan of Sandra remembers about her is included here and even some more new stuff. I wasn't disappointed. The quality of the picture and sound is good. It would have been nice to see some interviews with her, but the DVD only has Sandra's videos. I loved the DVD in any case. None of the pop singers these days can match Sandra and so it is essential to have it for the nostalgia at least.",1207094400,3,534,4.028301886792453
7997386,3,B0000AIT8G,"I love Sandra  seem 80 time...even before that (arabesque) .after ""painting in yellow"" is not that great....this DVD is pretty good . But still missing  clip  "" don't cry"". and the bonus is nothing special there. I wished they should add more her TV appearance or live  fete performance when she solo herself  . otherwise  this DVD is pal region not ntsc , that why i give only 3 stars",1207008000,2,385,4.428571428571429
