3804981,2,B001UV4XW4,"I made the mistake of paying to watch this in the theater. The movie was educational, and it was quality footage, but it seemed like it was just re-edited footage from Planet Earth...literally. It was advertised as following the lives of three animal families, but it was annoying how it kept switching between the polar bears, elephants, and whales.

Other animals were shown as well, and we loved the exotic birds, but I would have liked to see more of the animals, and less of the trees and ice. The hunting scenes didn't show anything bloody, and quickly cut away after an animal was taken down by a predator. I suppose some parents might prefer that, but it left my son thinking that the animals were just playing tag. The main reason we watch these movies is for facts, but that's Disney for you.

They went to such pain to avoid showing animals suffering that I don't understand why they showed the daddy polar bear starve to death, or the lost baby elephant. At least it didn't have any of the lectures about mankind destroying nature.

3804982,3,B001UV4XW4,"We took our preschooler to see Disneynature's Earth movie on Saturday, and I have to say that I was rather disappointed. That's not to say that it was bad, in fact the footage was stunning, and was amazing to see on the big screen.
In our household we are big fans of nature shows, which I think I may have mentioned before. We regularly watch Nature on pbs on Sunday nights, and love to see and learn about this amazing planet we live on. For this reason, we fell in love with and purchased Planet Earth when it was released on DVD a couple of years ago. It is Amazing!! Truly it is. We don't even own an HDTV - just a regular, though admittedly quite large, tube tv, but even so, it is still quite breathtaking to watch. The footage is spectacular, and makes me want to go out an buy an HDTV just to see what it looks like in HD! Also, each episode has a little mini feature at the end showing you what adventures they went through to film that particular episode, and those are rather fascinating to watch! Makes me wish I could go out an do stuff like that too :) Also, if, like my husband, you don't like nature shows that seem bent on making you feel guilty for all the terrible things we're doing to our planet, Planet Earth is still an excellent choice, because it lets you enjoy all these amazing things without guilt-tripping you until the last couple of episodes on the final disk. And even those, if I remember correctly, seemed to be quite open-minded and interesting to watch regardless of whether you're a tree-hugger or not :)
Now, you might be asking yourself - What does my love of Planet Earth have to do with my dislike of Earth?
Let me tell you.
It is a complete rip-off.
I knew that it was made by the same people who brought us Planet Earth, but what I didn't realise was that they just took highlights from Planet Earth, threw them together with a new narrator and new supposedly more ""entertaining"" script, along with some ""new"" footage which was probably just the stuff that didn't make it into Planet Earth, and packaged it all together and called it new.
I also thought it was going to be aimed at a younger audience, since it is Disney, and the marketing made me think that it was going to be following the three animal families in a fun, child-friendly sort of way, but it wasn't really any different from any other nature show in that way. My daughter got bored and spent the second half of the show wanting to walk up and down the stairs, and I don't really blame her, I would have got bored at her age too.
If you are trying to decide whether to spend the money to go and watch this movie in the theatre, here's what I would tell you: If you haven't seen Planet Earth, or if you'd like to see some of it on the big screen, go and see it. If you have young children, get a babysitter. If you've seen it and were blown away by the majestic beauty of our planet, buy Planet Earth. You won't regret it :)
Planet Earth wins. Hands down.",1241049600,3,2964,4.25709219858156
3804983,1,B001UV4XW4,"A lot of death happens in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death?  Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film!

And, why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers?  Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money?

Then in typical, comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip. Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat!

If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migrating, parenting, problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration, instead?

3804984,3,B001UV4XW4,"Disney's ""Earth"" is the Cliff Notes version of the brilliant BBC ""Planet Earth"" series. If you've seen the BBC version, no need to see this. Even the narrative is pretty much straight from the BBC script with a few added zingers and James Earl Jones replacing the original David Attenborough. I wish I would have known before plunking down the money for a movie ticket.

Also, several small children in the theater were upset by the predation scenes and left in tears. It's Disney, but it isn't Mickey Mouse.

3 stars for the spectacular video footage from stellar videographers and crew, James Earl Jones' silky narration, and the beautiful score. Minus 2 stars for repackaging what's already been done. Nature lovers, get the BBC Planet Earth series. It's amazing.",1240704000,3,766,4.930232558139535
3804985,4,B001UV4XW4,"The breathtaking visuals of ""Earth"" are more than enough for me to recommend it. Through a combination of hot-air balloons, helicopters, and even satellites hundreds of miles above, directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have captured aerial footage the likes of which I've rarely seen. The footage shot on ground level isn't too bad, either, revealing a marvelous display of animal activity that so few have been able to see. What isn't quite as breathtaking is the way the film is turned into a pseudo-narrative, one that chronicles the lives of various animal species as they struggle to survive one year; in true Disney fashion, most notably in wilderness films like ""The Jungle Book"" and ""The Lion King,"" almost every animal we see is personalized, made to seem like a character instead of a study subject. It's not altogether unsuccessful, but on the whole, I would have preferred to not identify with the animals.

With a very intentional release date of April 22--Earth Day--""Earth"" has generated renewed interest in Walt Disney's ""True Life Adventures,"" short documentaries filmed between 1948 and 1960 that focused on the animal kingdom. I haven't seen any of them, although I find it fascinating and admirable that Disney saw fit to capture real animals on camera and not just portray them in cartoons. The film itself is compiled from the BBC and Discovery Channel eleven-part miniseries ""Planet Earth,"" which I also haven't seen. This may account for why ""Earth"" often feels like it's covering too much material in such a short length of time; so much natural beauty is shown and so many animals are studied that watching it all can occasionally be overwhelming. Then again, narrowing the focus would defeat the purpose of the title. And goodness knows no one would be able to tolerate a 660-hour-long documentary.

Many stories are woven throughout one another, but the main focus is on three animal families and the harsh realities of surviving on Earth. The first one centers on a mother polar bear and her two cubs; they awaken from hibernation in the Arctic Circle and begin a dangerous journey towards the sea to look for food. The father bear, who began hunting before his family awoke, faces starvation after falling through thin ice and getting lost. It's probably the most heart-wrenching sequence in the entire film, especially since we know that global warming contributed to the problem. Still, one wonders: How did the filmmakers know that this bear was the father of the two cubs? Is it at all possible that was made up just for the sake of creating drama?

The second story centers on a mother elephant and her calf as they trek across the deserts of Africa in search of water. A vicious sandstorm separates them from the rest of the herd, putting them at risk for dehydration and exposure to predators. Lions, for example, have been known to prey on calves. We see them make an attempt when the elephants camp for the night at a watering hole.

The third story centers on a mother humpback whale. She swims 3,000 miles with her calf to the waters off Antarctica, where krill will be abundant by summertime. Their journey isn't without some danger; Great White sharks are some of the biggest marine predators around, and when it's time to feed, they will not show any mercy. If you want proof, just wait until you see a slow motion shot of a surfacing shark swallowing a sea lion.

Some minor stories work their way into the film. In an unbelievably cute sequence, a group of ducklings emerge from a tree and attempt to fly for the first time. They only fall to the ground, but hey, that how you learn. In another sequence, a flock of storks fly majestically over the Himalayas, battling wind and fog. We also see birds that inhabit the rainforests, specifically exotic birds of paradise. The males sure know how to strut their stuff when they're in search of a mate. One astonishing slow motion shot shows a lone leopard chasing a springbok across an African plain. It's a sobering reminder of the Circle of Life.

All these events are narrated by James Earl Jones (replacing an original narration by Patrick Stewart). His distinctively deep voice serves the material well, especially when the film pauses to focus on plant life and geographic formations. At one point, time-lapse photography documents the progress of various flowers and fungi. Later on, we're treated to awe-inspiring camera passes over towering waterfalls, many with rainbows hovering playfully in the mist. These shots alone make ""Earth"" worthy of a trip to the theater. The concept may be a little too big for a ninety-minute documentary, but its visuals are top notch. On the whole, this is a pleasant and informative film, at times fun, at times frightening, always giving the audience something to think about.",1240358400,2,4824,4.884004884004884
3804986,3,B001UV4XW4,"""But Mommy,"" sobbed the little girl in the bathroom stall next to me, just after the movie ended, ""the daddy polar bear wasn't REALLY dying, was he? Not really, right?""

But he was. The narrator had just said so, twice, while the camera lingered on the lifeless animal.

If I took a young child to see this G-rated Disney film, we would both be horrified. All around me in the theater tonight were young families with toddlers and preschoolers. After a slow-motion segment where a cheetah overtook a panicked gazelle and bites down on its neck, the little girl in front of me climbed into her mother's lap, cried and hid her face.

I couldn't believe how many scenes in this film are about death and dying. It's like Uncle Walt's old True Life Adventures have become True Death Adventures! The movie lingers on these moments, usually in slow motion. Worse, many of the victims are babies: a little caribou chased down by a wolf; a tiny elephant, lost, walking to its doom, following its mother's scent but going the wrong direction. When a pride of lions attack an elephant in the night, one jumps onto its back and the camera doesn't cut away. The film concludes with that weak, desperate polar bear, identified throughout the movie as the dad to two newborns, dying on the ice after being gored by a walrus.

Not exactly my idea of family night at the movies.

If any movie cries out for a PG rating, this one is it. Parental guidance is really needed here.

Near the end, James Earl Jones intones that although life in the wild is harsh, ""sometimes it is just paradise."" A montage of exquisite scenes follows, breathtakingly beautiful. Short segments throughout the film show what kind of movie this could have been: time-lapse shots of flowers growing, ducklings ""falling with style"" out of their tree nest (with a phrase borrowed from Buzz Lightyear), sailfish and dolphins darting through the water catching fish, baby polar bear cubs sliding on ice, flashy birds of paradise dancing their courtship rituals. This is the nature I want to see; I want to be exhilarated and fascinated. I don't want to have to cover my face so I can avoid seeing the terrified eyes of an animal at the very moment of its death.

In fact, Disney seems confused about exactly what film it wanted to create. Sometimes it seems the company was out to make a serious documentary, stuffing the narration full of facts right out of a biology textbook. Sometimes it's like Disney wanted a slapstick comedy, as the movie also includes various cutesy creatures scored to silly sound effects. Why include so many death scenes? My guess: Disney got the rights to the gruesome footage as part of the deal, and couldn't resist using it.

Those familiar with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;will recognize most of these scenes. About 60 percent of Earth is taken from that stunning television series. Seeing everything on the big screen makes an eye-popping difference, however. So much of this footage is simply amazing. It's hard to imagine how the filmmakers got some of the shots, including a Great White shark leaping out of the water and grabbing a sea lion in mid-air.

I recommend this movie for its gorgeous images, but be forewarned; it's not for those people squeamish about seeing animals dying. I'm one of those people, and I'd think twice before seeing this again. It left me drained, and a little depressed. I kept thinking about that baby elephant, walking off to certain death.",1240358400,12,3585,4.951747088186356

3805132,3,B001UV4XW4,"The footage is BEA-U-TI-FUL, but it's shockingly different in style and feel from the other Disney Nature films we own. ""Bears"" and ""Monkey Kingdom"" were both very real (telling of dangers, showing fights, and even death) but also light-hearted and story-driven. No lie, ""Earth"" felt like I was being scolded by Darth Vader because obviously I'm making the Earth die and therefore all of these beautiful animals... I mean, it's true information. The ice caps are melting... and that's why the baby polar bears' dad died.... lying next to prey he was too weak to eat..... because humans... Again, I believe kids should learn about how we negatively affect the planet so they will hopefully continue to try to save it in the future (****, I grew up on Ferngully), but it was pretty jarring to have a few minutes of nature education, then James Earl Jones lowering his already awe-inspiring voice to tell you that all this beauty is dying and it's your fault, then some nature footage, then death and destruction... Starving polar bears, stripped rain forests, elephants dying of thirst... Basically, it felt more like a very beautiful and long PSA. Which isn't bad or unnecessary. Just not what I was expecting based on the other Disney Nature films we've seen and might be a little rough for kids old enough to understand what he's saying but possibly not be ready to hear it stated so bluntly.",1492473600,8,1393,4.808333333333334

They don't even bother to name all of the animals they show along the way, from the Arctic in January to Antarctica in December.  They suggest an involvement with a polar bear family, a few elephants, and a humpback whale and her baby.  But little is said about them or what happens to them during the course of this year.
This is a rush job that took five years to make.  A lot of time-lapse photography was employed to showcase the passing seasons.  The cinematography is stunning, in this they always excel.  But as for the story they offer, very little, if any of it, is enlightening.  As far as science goes, the crucial tilt of the planet is mentioned in passing.  They also felt the need to mention several times: climate change, changing weather patterns, and that there is less and less ice each year.  Without once mentioning how or why this is happening.  Instead, with several excruciating slow-motion sequences, they depict animals chasing/killing other animals (in particular, babies), callously offering that this is just the circle of life.

This is a very pretty film to watch but thats about it.  They definitely need better writers or at least commit to a confident point-of-view.",1464825600,,1335,4.853982300884955

Another thing about this film was the amazing music they used. The only thing I can really complain about is the fact that they didn't go into further explanation on some things that I wished they had, like when the narrator is talking about the penguins and says You may not know this, but they are one of the few animals with a built in toboggan I just wish he would have expounded on that.

It's just as educational as you'd want it to be and far more entertaining than you'd expect it to be, making it an excellent choice to show to curious kids wanting to learn more about the realities of the world around them. The narration compliments the footage perfectly and allows you to find enough of an attachment to the animals we follow - all essentially characters in their own right - and to care about what happens to them. As we learn about what happens to them, in turn we learn more about earth itself, resulting in one of the most intelligent and beautifully made kid's films to hit screens in some time.

The only minor ""complaints"" I had were: 1) It wasn't clearly articulated what the 'path' of the movie was - we started in the Arctic and made our way down the earth, but there were sometimes random shifts in topology or climate that wasn't clearly explained, and 2) as expected, there wasn't enough time to focus more on all of the various wildlife pieces.

Disney Earth movie, I took the clear wrap off, and there was no DVD in there!  I couldn't believe it.  I received this March 6th, and we are on spring break from school. (I work at an elementary school too)  and we thought we would watch it.  I have been very satisfied with purchasing dvd's from Amazon.  I did purchase a used set of Nicolas Sparks movies one time, and they skipped.  And that is why I have purchased NEW from then on.  So I was completely shocked when I took the sealed wrap off, which made me believe it was new,  and there was no DVD in it.  I paid $12.94 for a case only.

3805641,5,B001UV4XW4,"Take the BBC Planet Earth series, condense it, add a nice storyline to make a single movie, add some cheeky commentary/narration by ""Lord Vader"" and you have this. Oh, don't forget to take out ALL animal deaths, SLIGHT SPOILER  the big cats chase its prey and as soon as the cat ""tags"" the prey, before the claws snag and teeth chomp to make the kill, the movie moves onto the next scene. Another SLIGHT SPOILER  the one part where an attack and teeth actually make contact is in the Great White Shark and Seal scene which is nicely filmed in super-fast shutter speed, which means super Slow-Motion.

This is great to get children interested in nature. and hopefully one day into ""big boy"" and ""big girl"" documentaries like the BBC & Discovery ones.",1370390400,3,749,4.616541353383458

3805729,4,B001UV4XW4,"I love nature videos, and DisneyNature produces some of the best I've ever seen.

The ""plot"" of Earth is decent. It is well narrated by James Earl Jones.

But what makes these movies so amazing is the imagery and soundscapes.

Unfortunately the Amazon Instant Video version does NOT do this movie justice. I was expecting HD quality, what I got was worse than DVD. In some scenes particularly with a LOT of moving things (i.e. a huge flock of birds, a giant herd of caribou) the compression Amazon adds to their video becomes unacceptably blocky.

The HD version I see they've added probably helps this considerably, but for whatever reason is not available for purchase.

If you want to see this movie in it's full glory, (the glory it deserves) purchase the blu-ray edition, rent the HD version here - OR - wait for amazon to sell a true HD experience.

** The movie itself deserves 5 stars absolutely. The missing star is for the drastic visual distortions from Amazon's video compression.",1338854400,,992,4.738372093023256

3805733,3,B001UV4XW4,"This film shows how truly beautiful our planet is!!  it's breathtaking!  The animals are very cute and a joy to watch.  However, this movie shows the harsh realities of what nature is and this can be very disturbing to both sensitive souls and children. It shows animals struggling for their lives and being captured by other animals.  It shows the harsh reality of polar bears struggling to find food and starving to death.  It is not a quick scene or two.  The circle of life, animals being hunted by other animals, makes up a large portion of the film.  Now, I understand that this is important to document because it is real and we can't hide from nature.  I get this.  I also get this film's message of preserving our environment so that the polar bears have a place to live and have food to eat, etc.  The environmental message is very important.  The problem is that the film's trailer is deceiving.  It looks like a film that focuses on the positive qualities of nature and a movie geared more for children.  It is much too upsetting.  This movie should not be rated G.  It should be rated pg13.  There were a lot of children in the theater when I went to see this and they were crying with the long, drawn out scenes of the animals about to die and be eaten.  It was just too much for them to handle and I saw parents shaking their heads and leaving the theater with their crying children.  As an animal lover and very sensitive person, I spent the majority of the film with hands over my eyes and crying because I hate to see any animal suffer or die, even if it is nature.  I understand that death is a part of nature. But I don't want to have to see it for the majority of a movie.  Some people are okay with this and are a bit tougher.  That is fine for them.  The movie is still beautiful and it really makes you appreciate our planet.  I just wanted to warn those who feel like me and those who have children.  Be prepared.",1314576000,53,1938,4.260989010989011

3805735,2,B001UV4XW4,"Granted, it says it's a BBC and Discovery co-production, but I also own Planet Earth on Blu-ray.  That's one of the best I have on that format.  I got this series, and thinking Disney's version would have more newly produced nature footage like that, I checked it out at my local library first before buying.

Boy was it a disappointment.  It was such a disappointment, I realized it was a waste of my time (didn't even have to buy it to still say that), when half-way through I realized all the scenes looked quite familiar.  I then jumped forward every few seconds to realize, every seen I saw was from Planet Earth!!  This is pretty shameful from a company as large as Disney that they couldn't possibly contract their own footage.

The only footage this has over Planet Earth is the DTS-HD.  Not like it matters, Attenborough is way better than James Earl Jones.  He should stick to Vader, instead of over-dramatizing nature monologues.
Planet Earth regularly sells for just a few more dollars, and it comes with 4 Blu-ray discs, instead of just one.  Get that, and you'll be pleased (but the BBC version, not the Discovery version).",1304467200,2,1137,4.668341708542713

Then I watched Disney's Earth DVD.

Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, I need to explain why I don't like this film.

If you have already seen the documentary that Discovery and the BBC released called Planet Earth, you have seen Disney's earth. They essentially trimmed down the nature shots so it can be seen as a film, and added James Earl Jones as the narrator.

Because this is a slimmer Planet Earth, the shots are still phenomenal. But they are the same exact shots we've already seen.

If you haven't seen Planet Earth, you need to rent it.

In my opinion Disney should have clearly warned about these kind of scenes.",1291161600,,484,5.466666666666667
3805772,4,B001UV4XW4,"The main reason I got this blu-ray is because we recently got a new TV and I wanted a nature documentary to give the TV a test run (because we all know how amazing nature looks!).  I'm not too savvy on nature documentaries in the first place, so I'm mainly writing this review from my personal experience with the movie.  Like other people have said, this does get VERY depressing at times but I expect that out of any nature documentary because life, while beautiful, is cruel.  Also, I was expecting it to be much more graphic then it was just based on my personal experience with any documentary that has animals in it.  While animals did die, they did a good job of cutting off the scene before it got bloody and gross.  Overall, I thought the hunting aspect of the film was done in a very ""clean"" way, and that saved me from a bunch of embarrassing weeping in front of my husband, who would have surely just rolled his eyes at me.

Oddly, the only thing that really made me cry was how beautiful the time lapse scenes were (and there was quite a few).  Seeing blooming flowers, melting ice, and satellite images of the changes of the Earth over time was really something else and made me want to get more of Disneynature's films to hopefully stop my heart like Earth did.  I had never seen any of the birds of paradise, and was floored at the small section devoted to them.  It made me laugh, and shocked me that these creatures are even out there.

The animal scenes were sad at times, but I thought the movie ended and left me feeling good.  You get to see what they go through just to survive, and have been going through for years and years.  Nature is just so sad and yet so awesome.  It's hard to wrap your mind around the stuff that happens

3805819,1,B001UV4XW4,"Nowhere on the back of this DVD did it talk about what a sad, and upsetting movie this is.  From the description on the back, to the trailer itself, Disney advertised this movie as if it was a magical, enjoyable, and relaxing look into the beauty and wonders of nature, which is why I, and I'm sure many others, bought or rented this DVD.

 What they don't tell you is that every 5-10 minutes during this film, they switch from an enchanting, warm picture of nature and its wonderful creatures, to a suspenseful, depressing scene of animal death, most often involving the infants and cubs.
I can't tell you how many times I had to watch an adult wolf, lion, or shark hunt down and kill a baby elephant, caribou, deer, or seal.  And when I wasn't watching an animal being murdered, I was watching an animal starve to death in terrible conditions.

 No, I am not naive.  Yes, I do realize that this is the reality of the world we live in, that certain animals feed off of other animals, and that climate change and other factors are hurting the animal world and the quality of their lives.  But if that's what you want to showcase in your film, then at least advertise it as such, so that the viewer can decide if they want to watch a grim documentary about the upsetting side of life on Earth, or if they'd rather watch a movie that focuses on life, new birth, and the positive, happy, and uplifting aspects of our world, which is what this movie tricks us into thinking it is.

 Hard to believe that Disney of all people, who are known for their happy and upbeat family entertainment, would be the ones to turn something wonderful into something that leaves you feeling saddened and depressed about the world we live in.

 So, as my title says, if you are someone who likes animals, enjoys watching them in the LIVING, and would NOT enjoy watching them suffer and die, then do yourself a favor and skip this movie altogether. And if you have kids, I would also suggest not letting them see this, as it will most likely upset them, possibly even traumatize them.  I for one will probably not recover from this downer of a documentary for some time.

Why did they need to include the cheetah scene when he hunts and kills the baby animal or the scene where the baby elephant is hunted and eaten alive by the lions? Not to mention the polar bear dying a slow death. Really Disney??? G rated?

It brought to mind Disney-produced nature documentaries from my childhood, like ""The Living Desert"" and ""The Vanishing Prairie"".

The footage is absolutely spectacular - a brood of geese caught in their first venture from the tree-nest one by one with James Earl Jones' Disnified narration ""not so much flying as falling... with style"" borrowing a line from ""Toy Story"".  The presense of that great Jones baritone elevates the film.  In an earlier generation a narration from Olivier would invoke a sense of awe.  Today, what could confer more importance than the very voice of Darth Vader?  In a Disney nod to his own film ""The Lion King"" Jones narrates this film's ""Circle of Life""... using that very phrase.

But back to the footage.  The filmmakers strung together a gripping narrative - a few longer subplots with a couple of shorter vignettes.  The longer sequences show us a year in the lives of a polar bear family, a herd of elephants and a mother and baby humpback whale.  All face life-threatening peril in climates that are beautiful to see, and often you couldn't help but wonder about the safety and techniques of the camera operators.  Shorter sequences are humorous - such as the unrequited mating dance of a bird of paradise, thrilling - such as the chilling southward migration of cranes over Mount Everest or wondrous helicopter footage shot over spectacular waterfalls, and gripping - with many spectacular slo-mo sequences of predator and prey: a cheetah brings down a savannah fawn, a wolf chases a galloping caribou and great white sharks breach the water with seal tails protruding from their jaws.  The editing is pretty judicious - not much gore - but you know that ""what happened next"" is some of our protagonists became lunch.

For those who correctly state that this footage is a trimmed-down edit of the longer BBC version, I would say that this might be an easier introduction for the little naturalist.  The small amount of exposure I had to science documentaries on The Wide World of Disney no doubt influenced my decision to pursue a career in science.  If I wanted my child to become the next Itzhak Perlman I'd start with a single Perlman performance, not the entire recorded works of Heifitz.

Superbly directed by Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who were responsible for the remarkable ""Planet Earth"" and ""The Blue Planet,"" respectively, ""Earth"" begins by telling us that our planet is ""just the right distance from the sun."" This fact, plus its positioning in regards to the sun, makes Earth an extraordinary entity. ""Earth"" is the story of ""three families,"" and how they struggle to survive: polar bears, elephants, and humpback whales. In doing so, we are taken to their habitats, and we witness -- as close as technology allows us to -- their daily lives. We are transported to virtually every ecosystem on earth, beginning with polar bears' habitats, during the dead of winter in the arctic, where we also see caribou migrations and the wolves that predate on them. We also visit the northern forests and enjoy their diversity, as well as the tropical rain forest, where, we are told, the lack of seasons allow the forest to grow unchecked, yielding, as a result, half of all the plants and animals that inhabit the planet. We are also transported to the Kalahari Desert, in Southern Africa, and observe the grueling quest of elephants and other animals for water. We are informed that ""grass is the great unsung hero of our planet"", and we see it first hand with the great game of East Africa`s grasslands. We also travel to the Himalayas, and witness the most difficult migration of them all, the one involving cranes, and how they try to migrate from cold Mongolia to warm India. Of course, we also visit the oceans, and see how mother and baby humpback whales migrate to the Antarctic. The film ends where it began: in the arctic, with the polar bears,

""Earth"" is perfect in every sense. Its cinematography is jaw-dropping, and its story is inspiring. The way the change of seasons was filmed is truly mesmerizing. This film really touched me, and I'm glad that Disney is keeping the tradition of making movies about nature, a tradition that dates back to the early fifties with the award-wining ""True Life Adventures."" Furthermore, this fantastic documentary is available as Blue Ray and DVD (both in one package), which also includes a making-of segment (DVD) and exclusive filmmakers' annotations (Blue Ray).

I was wrong  The footage on Disney's DVD is exactly the same. They show a lot of footage that does not pertain to any of the 3 groups to fill the added time. The photography is good, the views breathaking and worth watching but if you have a copy of the BBC planet earth series, don't buy it; you already have a copy of all the footage on those.

Scenes involving the elephants getting attacked by lions at night with the lightning cracking in the background as well a heartbreaking scene involving the polar bear trying to survive with no ice left.

It started off well and good showing great footage with accompanying facts I did not know. But it quickly piles on the Planet Earth footage.

So if you own Planet Earth you may want to rent this first. See if it's for you or not. I'm also skeptical of their next advertised dvd - Oceans. Something tells me it will probably just be Blue Planet.

3806254,4,B001UV4XW4,"""earth"", a film by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield.  Their work is known from one of the most ambitious and remarkable nature-based documentaries ever created, ""Planet Earth"".  ""earth"" is pretty much a much shortened version of ""Planet Earth"" but features new footage and focuses on survival of the polar bears, the elephants, lions, the whales and Great White shark and many creatures.

The film was released in theaters courtesy of Disney's independent film label ""Disneynature"", their first film and a film to highlight Earth Day (April 22nd).  The documentary was definitely a landmark project as it took 5 years to make, 45 camera people, 2000 days in the field, 204 locations, 62 countries in all seven continents.

What is remarkable about ""Planet Earth"" and ""Earth"" is its fantastic imagery.  Using HD cameras and the latest technology in cinema, viewers are able to experience tremendous images, some that look so unreal but are real.  In fact, no CG was ever used in the film.

Camera work in capturing nature's food chain and capturing survival of these creatures (parents, no need to worry - there are no visual carnage taking place but the creatures trying to capture their prey) is incredible, as with the film's editing.

Watch as the film kicks off in the Arctic as a mother polar bear emerges out of its hole with their two cubs while a male polar bear searches for food.  A herd of antelope and their young walking through the fields but then a group of wolves go after them, in order to find their food.  Or a group of elephants in the Kalahari Desert who walk near a pack of lions and the lions wait until nightfall to make their attack.  Images of nature of these creatures up-close in their natural habitat and all captured in film.

Although a lot of the ""earth"" focuses on the creatures trying to survive, there is an underlying message.  The message is how the animals are trying to adapt to their conditions and for some areas, those conditions continue to grow worse and of course, the underlying message that if this happening with the creatures, what about humankind?

The ""earth"" Blu-ray comes in two discs.  The first disc is the actual Blu-ray disc and the second is the DVD version of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""earth"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  It's important to note that ""Planet Earth"" is one of those Blu-ray releases that many people have felt are a must-own for picture quality.  Of course, I'm sure there are people who may feel it is way too expensive for them and too long for their tastes.  But with ""Earth"", you do get the shortened version focusing on the creatures and a lot of that incredible imagery is included on this Blu-ray release.

The white arctic to the sand hills of the desert and the beautiful skies and ocean and the lush greenery from all over the world, the beautiful landscapes of those locations are captured on HD and looks amazing.  So, one can expect excellent picture quality.

The audio of ""earth"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) and also in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is narrated by James Earl Jones (note: the UK version is narrated by Patrick Stewart) and for the most part, the film's narration and beautiful music by George Fenton (""Bewitched"", ""Hitched"", ""Planet Earth"").

Narration and music are front and center channel-driven while certain sound effects such as the arctic and the ice breaking can be heard through the surrounds or the great white shark swallowing its prey.  But James Earl Jones vocals are clear and understandable.  Also, his narration is well-timed and never interferes during the film's most awesome moments.

Subtitles for the film are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""earth"" comes with the following special features:

  * Filmmaker Annotations - The following is an exclusive to the Blu-ray edition.  You can watch the film and read text with important facts and also see a picture-in-picture display of Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield talking.  It's important to note that if your Blu-ray player's audio is set at bitstream, you will need to change it to LPCM to hear the audio from the video picture-in-picture portion.
  * Earth Diaries - The Making of Earth the Movie - (42:30)  A documentary featuring Alastair Fothergill, Mark Linfield and crew discussing how they captured the various scenes in the film and how they utilized the latest of camera technology to capture 360 shots or the animals running at full speed.  An informative and intriguing documentary that shows us how challenging and ambitious this film was.  It's absolutely amazing to watch this.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the most part, ""earth"" is definitely a documentary that is visually amazing.  But it all comes down to what one would expect in a documentary.

Not long ago, there was a release called ""HOME"" that featured on how humans in different parts of the continent have destroyed their land, how global warming is affecting everyone, the loss of water and the number of fish decreasing and a message that was definitely clear about changes that needs to be done now.

""earth"" is less preachy but it does have an underlying message that if the animals are trying to survive (and they have been on this planet way longer than us) with the changes in condition, shouldn't humans learn from these animals and how the changes will affect us?

There is no doubt that ""earth"" is a visually remarkable film, but is it worth the double dip if you own ""Planet Earth""?  For some, the additional, newer footage may be worth the double dip but if you are a big fan of the original, then it will definitely be worth it.

For those who have never owned ""Planet Earth"", I recommend getting it, since it is such a landmark documentary  and for Blu-ray owners, it's one of those reference titles showcasing amazing picture quality.  But for those who have no desire to watch 11 hours of a documentary and perhaps, not want to spend so much money can definitely enjoy this visual and intriguing documentary known as ""earth"".

This Blu-ray captures the amazing picture quality of ""Planet Earth"" but in a shortened 90 minute version.  Still a visual treat for viewers and most of all, for those who never experienced ""Planet Earth"" will find ""earth"" still worth watching!",1251763200,5,6328,4.827298050139276
3806255,2,B001UV4XW4,"If you've seen Planet Earth already, there is no reason at all to watch this.  All this movie is is bits and pieces of Planet Earth.  It just makes no sense.",1249948800,58,157,4.032258064516129
3806256,4,B001UV4XW4,"Awesome is the word that comes to mind when I watched this documentary feature at the dollar movies with my family today. Even my rather squirmy preschooler was quiet for most of the movie, enthralled by the lush portrayal of landscape and animals on the big screen.

Narrated by James Earl Jones, ""Earth"" follows the seasons as different animals around the planet make the migration from one place to another, as well as struggle to find food amidst an increasingly warming world. The narration covers the struggles of a family of polar bears, comprising mom, two cubs and dad [dad is off on his own looking for food, whilst mom and cubs make the long, arduous trek towards the food source], a herd of elephants who struggle on a long march to the water hole whilst battling predators and starvation, the delightful bond of love between a mother humpback whale and her calf as they make a thousands miles journey across the globe to find food, etc.

There are tense scenes of predators chasing and closing in on their prey, though the scenes are so tastefully done that young children will not be unnecessarily traumatized. The message that the cycle of life neccessitates brutality is subtly put forth, and well-balanced against the humorous scenes of the bird of paradise in New Guinea which 'cleans house' and attempts a silly mating dance to attract a potential mate!

The glorious vistas of cascading waterfalls, lush green fields, the sight of thousands of buffaloes enjoying the water holes...these are but some of the amazing visuals in the film to enthrall and delight viewers [not to mention a superb scene of a great white in attack motion].

Highly recommended!",1247875200,5,1674,4.863157894736842
3806267,4,B001UV4XW4,"This nature documentary is a 90-minute mini-version of the much longer Planet Earth produced by the BBC. The latter production took five years to make, had a $25 million budget, and employed the latest in photographic technology. The super slow motion and time lapse techniques are especially impressive. Watching the twelve-month transformation of a forest in 30 seconds is spectacular. Earth focuses on three animal ""families""--a polar bear and two cubs, a herd of elephants, and then a mother and baby humpback whale that make a 4,000 mile migration. In between these three stories the film intersperses takes from the longer documentary. My only complaint is that this production oversells the product with music that at times is both melodramatic and cutesy, and a corny narration that is clearly intended for young children (""Time for mom and dad to fix breakfast for junior!""). If there is any nature photography that does not need hype, this big screen version is it. Still, like its longer predecessor, Earth makes for fantastic family viewing.",1244160000,41,1053,5.16374269005848
3806268,5,B001UV4XW4,"I watched this documentary on the Internet and cannot wait for its release on DVD. This one documentary is the best documentary about our planet that I have seen so far. It takes the viewer on a trip from the North Pole to the South Pole, showing nature and life in astonishing and breath taking images. It combines high aerial shots and time-laps shots with regular ones and blends them together nicely.

You will see nature as you have never seen it before. When it talks about herds of hundreds of thousands of animals, it's not only telling you this, it also shows it.

This movie combines the best images from the award winning BBC documentary series ""Planet Earth"" (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series</a>). It is like a ""Best Of"", compressed down to under 2 hours. It starts slowly with an Ice-bear mother and its two young when spring breaks and the they first leave the cave where the mother spent the winter and the baby ice-bears were born and then takes you on a journey across all continents, climate and geological zones.

It also shows how vulnerable our fragile world is and the impact of our civilization where you can see it on an epic scale that makes the difference between life and death for many species.

It also shows the reality of death, not graphically, but also not distorted. If your children are unable to deal with the fact that ""Bamby"" might get killed by hungry wolf, this documentary video is probably not for them and cause tears and a broken heard. On the other hand is it also a good way to teach your children the lesson about the inevitability of death and the natural food chain of this planet.

After you watched this documentary, you will not look at this, our planet, the same way as you did before.",1243296000,3,1903,4.971698113207547

I wish I would have come here and read a review or two to get that message first, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect completely original footage in a new feature film. That said if you haven't seen any of the BBC/Discovery stuff at all, and you don't want to invest the time or money into ""Planet Earth"" (but you should it's much better), it is pretty enough to be worth the ticket.",1242518400,10,454,4.2298850574712645
3806271,2,B001UV4XW4,"As a lifetime educator, a docent for one of the nation's premier wildlife centers and a great fan of the BBC's nature documentaries, I reacted to this film with absolute disgust.

Building on third-party footage, with a narrative script and soundtrack suited for a species well below the amoeba, this film revels in its predator-prey kill scenes (which it depicts in ultra slo-mo) and zips through scenes of natural beauty with predictable time-lapse photography. In short, it is an egregious mess.

Perhaps the most offensive attribute of this film is the way in which it characterizes predators. It reinforces ignorant, negative biases against wolves, depicts leopards and lions as villains -- and seems to revel in the bleakest aspects of survival.

But isn't it bleak out there? Sure. But too many struggles borne by too many creatures -- both predator and prey -- have been caused or complicated by humans -- about whom we hear little here.  Disney Company is careful to avoid the term ""global warming"" because it might alienate conservatives. It dotes on violence because a large segment of the American audience loves it.

If you and your kids are bright, I suggest buying one of David Attenborough's superb documentaries of the natural world on BBC Video. That way, you'll experience a more educated view of some remaining natural resources and wildlife on this planet.

I award two stars for two reasons: for the creatures this film depicts and for some of its cinematography. Other than that, I am ashamed to have tolerated as much of this film as I did.

PS. Do not take young children to see this. Some of the slo-mo killing scenes are literally unbearable. The predator-prey relationship is part of nature, but the glorification of pain we see in this film is not.",1242432000,17,1777,4.903333333333333
3806272,2,B001UV4XW4,"Movie is just repackaged Planet Earth. Absoulutely stunning and beautiful scenery. However, it should never have been rated G and marketed toward children. Thank you Disney for causing my kid to have nightmares. My 6 year old left the theater early and in tears! Disney could have eliminated the killing and death scenes for a G movie. Otherwise, should have been rated PG. Would have liked to see a ""parent beware"" warning posted. Like another reviewer, I too thought this movie would be a cute film about three animal families. Go see the movie without the young ones or better yet get the Planet Earth series instead.",1242172800,9,620,4.803738317757009
3806273,5,B001UV4XW4,"Starting with a polar bear family in the Artic this movie navigates the globe. Virtually all habitats are covered, including temperate forests, tropical jungles, deserts, deltas and the ocean. The photography is brillant and breathtaking, both of animal and plant life. It manages to cover the effects of climate change without sounding preachy. I loved the segments about the elephants, the humpback whales and the birds of paradise. It's really hard to imagine how this movie could have been any better.

It's true there were numerous scenes of predators attacking prey, though none that were excessively gory. I think the movie's depiction of ""the web of life"" in a realistic fashion was the right choice. But parents will need to know their kids and make appropriate decisions about what they can or cannot handle. As an adult I very much enjoyed it and found it be a worthy reminder of the glories of nature that we humans too often forget.",1241827200,10,945,4.90625
3806274,5,B001UV4XW4,"I had heard that some children might find this movie upsetting, so with some hesitation, I took my five year old to see it yesterday.  I told him before the showing that he might find it scary so he would be prepared, and we could leave if he wanted.

We had a great time together, and he wants to see the film again.  It was probably better to prepare him in advance.  I just explained that their is no grocery store in the wild to feed the animals and the reality of nature is not the same as the zoo, where animals are fed my humans.

The photography was awesome.  I was glad that the story combined drama and a certain comic relief.  It was fine for my son.  The photographers are true heros of the planet, in my opinion.  What they do is not without a certain risk.

I am glad that, as a five year old, he is already gaining an appreciation for the importance of preserving our natural world.  Except for the zoo, the movie is probably the best view I will ever get of a polar bear.

Some years ago, I did my own African safari in Kenya.  And I saw at fairly close range a cheetah chase and kill a gazelle much like shown in the film.  That was an experience I will never forget.  Our guide said we were fortunate to see that.  Most tourists on a short visit do not see such a thing.",1241395200,4,1288,4.0717131474103585
3806275,4,B001UV4XW4,"""Earth"" is such a terrible waste of time. I never believed in the animals once and the plight of their home was laughable.

Of course, I'm kidding. What can anyone say negative about ""Earth"", the newest film from Disney, launching their DisneyNature brand, and co-produced by Discovery and BBC?

The film contains gorgeous photography showing a handful of animals across the planet. Moving in a more or less sensical fashion across the globe, we start by watching a family of polar bears in the North Pole. Mama and her two cubs venture out of their hibernation and we watch as the two cubs take their first steps across the frozen ice. I defy even the most hard\-hearted individual to not find these cubs adorable. With the success of ""March of the Penguins"", it must be required to include footage of cute baby animals in any nature film released. But as James Earl Jones' grave voice intones ""One of these cubs will most likely not live through the year"". Oh, oh. Then the footage picks up their father who is treading across increasingly thin ice to find food. Whether or not these animals are related (and I don't see how the filmmakers could know this) is beyond the point. The filmmakers are trying to tell a story and craft it in such a way as to reach their core audience, families with kids.

The filmmaker's camera crew begins to journey around the globe capturing amazing shots of huge flocks of birds migrating across the oceans, baby birds taking their first flights, an elephant herd roaming across the savannah. And much more.

Throughout, Jones' gravelly, authoritative voice cues in to give us snippets of information, identifying the animals and telling us a little bit about them. Jones has the sort of voice that you instantly think everything he says is fact.

The footage the filmmakers have managed to capture is really quite stunning. We watch as a group of wolves hunt a pack of caribou and then chase one of the herd's fawns. Of course, since this is a Disney film, just as the wolf overtakes his prey, the film cuts away. They aren't going to go so far as to show the death of the prey. That would be too upsetting for the kids. They also use some aerial footage of Mount Everest, using special planes provided by the Tibetan Army. And amazing footage of humpback whales. And cute footage of a bird doing a sort of mating dance. And... And...

My one small complaint about the film would be that the trailers announced we would be following three families over the course of their struggle to survive. The film introduces us to three 'families', but after spending a few minutes with them, we move on to a new subject. The polar bears are the only creatures we revisit during the course of the film. And the film doesn't really show us the hard stuff, the difficult material. I understand there are a lot of kids in the audience, but I think it is necessary to see animals die to understand the whole cycle of life. They also need to see the effects of global warming in an effort to make some of them more responsible citizens of our planet.

The same people behind the Discovery Channel series ""Planet Earth"" make ""Earth"" and if the series contains the same types of amazing images, I will be checking it out as well.",1241308800,,3247,4.587931034482758
3806276,3,B001UV4XW4,"As others have commented, this movie is essentially a montage of footage from the Planet Earth TV series. But oh what footage. It takes some of the best shots (polar bear attacking walruses, great white shark leaping out of the water) and puts them into one movie. The film spans the entire earth, desert, jungles, forests, and poles, giving viewers a good sense of the planet's diversity.

The film is particularly well suited for people who don't like to watch long nature documentaries. It takes the best of Planet Earth and puts it into an hour and a half. Furthermore, unlike the TV series, the movie accentuates some of the funnier scenes with lighthearted narration by James Earl Jones and upbeat music. For example, the scenes with the birds of paradise in New Guinea were put to a light dance music as birds danced around for mates.

Some reviewers have complained that this movie is too violent for kids. The film does not actually show any animal violence and tends to cut away before anything gruesome happens. However, it does not shy away from ""the circle of life."" In a sense, the film fails to strike a balance between more mature audiences and youth. Kids might feel bad for the animals, while adults might feel that the chase scenes cut away too quickly.

A more serious flaw is the fact that the movie lacks a major theme or story. Unlike March of the Penguins, it does not follow a single species and tell their story, but cuts between different animals, in particular, elephants, polar bears, and whales). The film occasionally dwelt on the challenges of growing up and focused on newborn elephants, polar bears, and whales. However, it also jumps to other animals without notice (such as the birds of paradise, which are not even on the same continent as any of the other animals). At the end of the day, it looks like the movie was a patched together ""best of"" Planet Earth rather than a free-standing film in its own rights.

Overall, this movie is worth renting (perhaps not paying the theater ticket though). You'll get to see beautiful shots of humpback whales using bubble nets to catch krill; great white sharks leaping out of the water; baby ducks jumping from a tree; elephants swimming in a river; and birds of paradise dancing for their mates. The movie will be especially useful if you don't have the time or patience to sit through the 550-minute Planet Earth series.",1241136000,,2402,4.711904761904762
