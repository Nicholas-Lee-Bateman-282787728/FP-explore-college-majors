6203113,3,B00HSJ2AWW,"I'm not afraid to admit that I rather enjoy the ""found footage"" genre. There have been some gems in the genre, like ""Grave Encounters,"" ""Haunted Changi,"" and ""V/H/S,"" just to name a few. Lamentably, this film didn't make the cut, in my opinion. There was some rather gratuitous nudity and sex, but the main character, Jill, was a caricature of a ""free spirit."" She was ridiculously immoral. The few scares were rather cookie-cutter.",1412294400,3,432,4.931506849315069
6203114,2,B00HSJ2AWW,"This is a pedestrian found footage movie. It seems that film makers are still chasing The Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity with very hit and miss success. There are some creepy moments and the atmosphere in the asylum (?) is pretty good, especial considering the majority of this was done during the day. As with most lower budget horror flicks the movie falls down on the script, interesting characters and the lack of funds (?) to create some really cool makeup effects etc...

Had the film taken place at night and there were some cool makeup or and video effects and a more interesting script and characters (does this sound redundant?) the film could have been quite scary and fun. It seems that cool and fun horror flicks are super scarce. This may be worth checking out on Netflix streaming to kill 75 minutes, as far as a purchase I would pass.",1406160000,,855,4.625
6203115,2,B00HSJ2AWW,"When you have a director who has made an iconic horror movie in the past, you certainly have to check out his future projects.  After all, lightning has struck more than once for many directors in Hollywood.  So when I realized Bernard Rose, director of the infamous CANDYMAN back in the early 90s, was making a new film, I knew I had to jump on it.  CANDYMAN was a nice dose of terror, and I hoped Rose could pull off the same with this one.  Unfortunately, SX_TAPE falls way short of anything resembling horror, and the result is a lackluster film that is as confusing as it ridiculous.

I wanted so badly to like this film.  The fine folks at Well Go keep putting out hit after hit after hitbut I guess every company misses the mark every now and then.  Sadly, such is the case with this film.

SX_TAPE is shot in the typical found-footage style, with a personalized POV and shaky camera angles.  This is not a bad thing at all, as those two aspects are a big part of what make found-footage films so fun.  But the rest of the film fails in every other area, and thus forces the movie to sink into oblivion territory.

The acting is ok, although the characters themselves are arrogant and annoying.  They go out of their way to push societal limits and see how stupid they can be without getting busted.  Like having sex in the dressing room of a nice clothing store; they do get caught, which forces them to run, but they end up stealing something as they leave!  See the kind of people they are?  So why in the world would I care about them when bad things start happening?  This is a huge flaw in the film, even more so when two of their friends show up. If I cant connect with the main characters or feel anything for them, why should I continue to watch?

The plot of SX_TAPE is a ho-hum storyline that weve seen in countless films.  I wish screenwriters would move out of the abandoned-hospital setting and into something original.  Not to mention the shooting location of the filmI swear Ive seen that same building used in four other horror films.

Which brings us to the storyline itself.  Much of it doesnt make sense, and what does is not very good.  There are many questions that struck me when I was watching.  When Jill starts begging Ian to take her home, why would he turn around and follow her back into the hospital once their friends show up?  And why would her friends want to go in there when they see how upset Jill is?

Pushing that aside, the final scene makes NO sense whatsoever.  It tries to be shocking, and I suppose it technically ishowever it doesnt fit with anything else in the movie.  I shook my head when the credits started rolling and was actually glad to see it end.

SX_TAPE  is not a film I can recommend, unless you are starving for rehashed found-footage concepts.  I am disappointed with director Rose, and I hope he chooses better material in the future.  This film is available now if you want to give it a look.",1405641600,4,2960,4.376146788990826
6203116,3,B00HSJ2AWW,"Jill (Caitlyn Folley) is alive at the beginning of the film. We know her boyfriend Adam (Ian Duncan) is dead...thank you Bernard Rose for the plot spoiler and her two friends are missing. Jill doesn't know what happened. The film consists of a tape that Adam made to sell Jill's art.

If you don't like looking at Caitlyn Folley, then this film is not for you. We watch Jill paint nudes and pose naked by her window for strangers outside. While driving around they espy an abandoned hospital for pregnant girls. They opt to go inside and scope it out as a place to do an art exhibit while holding a Rav.

Jill is typically spontaneous, bubbly and sultry but is a bit tempered in her judgement. BTW I liked the right hand snake tattoo. Once inside we see a personality shift. Through a series of circumstances, their friends Bobby and Ellie join. Jill's personality changes as she seems to become possessed.

The horror aspect didn't happen until near the end of the film. Up to that point it was just odd noises. The film seemed more pornographic than horror. There is footage of a woman who is tied down being groped. Another instant we see a woman's head bobbing with a male hand on top of it. There are several instances of sex while clothed and a pixilated male organ that didn't make any sense.

With the hand held horror genre running out of ideas, sex is the next way to make a quick buck.

8635434,2,B00HSJ2AWW,All of the characters were annoying especially the main two. The acting was not that great & the story didn't make a whole lot of sense really. I guess the girl was just really messed up.,1520553600,,187,4.222222222222222

8635438,1,B00HSJ2AWW,Absolute and utter garbage. This feels like something that some talentless failing film students made over a weekend when they were bored. This could have been edited down to a 20-minute short film. What complete crap.,1462665600,,218,5.083333333333333

the camera  is one of the most steady ........... so you can see everything clear

but im nit picking now
see this movie and you will love it too",1461801600,,362,3.8783783783783785

8635441,4,B00HSJ2AWW,"The story of ""SX_Tape"" isn't anything new or overtly original but it is well thought out and executed nicely. In an attempt to blend the sex tape phenom into the horror story, Eric Reese develops a pretty convincing concept with some actual eerie moments. There is one aspect that fails in ""SX_Tape"" that is an Achilles' heel in many of the found footage stories, the plausibility that a person will continue to maintain control over a camera or keep a strong composure in the face of such a horrific, life altering moment such as unfolds in this film. It is debatable and doesn't really kill a story, but when it becomes a question mark for a good third of the story, it slows down the chilling nature of a major component in the film's main gimmick. However ""SX_Tape"" still manages to fully present a thrilling concept with a edgy, darkness that is entertaining.

""SX_Tape"" offers up a nice blend of effects both in soundtrack and effects. The horror elements are at a minimum as far as the visceral components but with the creepy sound effects, sudden shock moments and constant pace toward the inevitable ""SX_Tape"" gives the thrills in expected places and some not so expected places. I jumped and cringed several times in the course of watching this film. Bernard Rose gives good chills, and is worth checking out by any fan of paranormal horror, especially for the fan of this ever-growing subgenre we call found footage.",1432080000,,1427,4.754032258064516
8635442,2,B00HSJ2AWW,"This incoherent mess of a film was extremely disappointing. It alludes to much, but doesn't really explain itself. I wish it were a ""by the numbers"" found footage film. It would actually make sense then. Sex shouldn't be thrown in to distract from a lack of plot. I was never scared. I just wanted it to end.",1413417600,,308,4.421052631578948
8635443,5,B00HSJ2AWW,"Great movie. I wasn't too sure with a name like SX_Tape, cause I mean would this be a la stupid celebrity sex tapes? I get enough of that from just living. But I ended up purchasing this movie (at a way cheaper price than Best Buy) and it's actually not half bad. It has a solid story, which was surprising. If you collect movies based on the abandoned Linda Vista Hospital, add this to your collection, now!",1412380800,,408,4.311688311688312
