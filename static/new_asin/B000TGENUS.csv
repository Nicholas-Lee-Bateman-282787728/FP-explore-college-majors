8208947,3,B000TGENUS,"She is really not into any of these DVD's.  I have about 8 Baby Einstein DVD's, but she is just not interested in watching them.  She likes her My Baby Can Talk signing series and her My Baby Can Read DVD's.  But these, she just ignores and plays with her toys.
I have friend's whose babies like these, so maybe it is an individual thing.  I gave then three stars because they are cute.",1285372800,,386,4.175675675675675
8208948,5,B000TGENUS,"My grandaughter adores these DVD's.  They were the perfect gift that she will enjoy for a long time.  I recommend this product to anyone that wishes to encourage their children to enjoy development.  It was money well spent....a gift that keeps on giving.
I recommend all of the Baby Einstein products!",1247961600,,302,4.882352941176471
8208949,5,B000TGENUS,I have sent the defective product back to Amazon twice and it was returned to me both times.  The return label was on the top of the box.  I put the box back in the mail a number of days ago and hope it is now received as there are only ten days left to return it without being charged.  (N.B. I have already received the replacement product which is fine).  I am only trying to return the product that was missing a DVD.,1242518400,,421,3.9761904761904763
8208950,5,B000TGENUS,I have a 9+ month baby girl and she just absolutely loves Baby Einstein.  This is one of those must get items if you have a baby.  I got all 3 Stages (21 DVDs in all).,1232668800,,167,3.611111111111111
