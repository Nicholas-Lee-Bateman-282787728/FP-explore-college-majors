After viewing the DVD, I noticed that they actually fill in the blanks, but the author does not write about this in the book. Together with the DVD, I give the packet a 4 1/2 star rating. On its own, the books gets a 3 star rating and the DVD gets 4 stars.

Greetings

8107620,5,B000E98342,"Having over fifteen years of experience in the martial arts and nine years of experience in the field of strength and conditioning, ""Training for Warriors"" by Martin Rooney is a comprehensive guide on how to become a true warrior in realm of competition.  This book adds to Martin's body of other training manuals and DVDs. The lessons learned from this manual and his other works are all interchangeable.

  Martin's message is made clear to the reader in three ways.  Firstly, the language used to communicate is simple and effective.  Secondly, the material is able to be applied to different areas of performance enhancement.  Lastly, Martin is clearly a ""practice what you preach"" practitioner.  The reader will immediately know that Martin has been personally in the battle in which he is preparing you for.

  I have recommended this book to many strength coaches and martial arts instructors, and I will continually recommend it to anyone who truly has the desire to become a warrior!",1145577600,4,992,5.024539877300613
