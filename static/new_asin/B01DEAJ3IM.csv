The partnership between Herbert Blomstedt and the Danish National Symphony Orchestra dates back to 1955 and has now thus  astonishingly - entered its seventh decade. The rapport between conductor and orchestra is palpable in this concert from 2007 in the imposing venue of the Lutheran Roskilde Cathedral; one little vignette serves to illustrate this when following the crescendo beginning at 600 in the first movement of the Bruckner symphony, two lady violinists are caught on camera exchanging beaming smiles of what looks like pure gratification at the music-making they are producing  unless its some private joke we as the audience have missed.

The camera reveals that Blomstedts baton technique is highly economical, his direction relying more upon facial expression and understated gesture. The cameras concentration upon him is informative and probably just as well given that the coverage of  the orchestral is somewhat random: more often than not shots are cut away before the instrumentalist in question has made his or her contribution. This is particularly noticeable in the first movement when a shot of the idle timpanist seems to be preparing the viewer for his entry but when it comes the camera is trained elsewhere. When the quartet of Wagner tubas are playing, only three are in shot; one wonders how well or closely the editor is following the score. More interesting are the few panoramic and aerial shots of the cathedrals interior which pan out and give a sense of its space but too often the editing is choppy and wilful.

The sound is very good, warm and mellow and not by any means compromised by the five second reverberation of the venue but unfortunately capturing all too well the clattering at 1253 in the Schubert and 832 in the Bruckner, plus a strange squeak like a strangulated clarinet at 3914 in the latter.

In truth, none of that much matters given the quality of the playing of both symphonies here. Blomstedt conducts without a score and is evidently getting just we he wants from his band at every point; he keeps the lyricism and drama of the Unfinished in perfect balance, really catching the dark, brooding mystery of the minor key passages and the majesty of the development in the first movement. His approach is more in the mode of Bernstein than Szell, but he is even slower and more emphatic in the Allegro moderato. The second movement is ideal; Blomstedt completely avoids the rather plodding sternness which for me mars Furtwnglers Unfinished; he is first wistful, the determined, then noble, before the beautifully toned solo clarinet begins its winding discourse culminating in a peroration of stern resolve, strengthened by boldly blaring brass.

I had recent firsthand experience of Blomstedts Bruckner only last month when I heard his performance with the Philharmonia of the Fourth at the Royal Festival Hall; it thus came as no surprise to find his Seventh here to be wonderfully intense and concentrated. He plays the Nowak edition but without cymbal or triangle. His tempi are relatively slow compared with Karajan and Giulini  except in the Scherzo, where they are identical  but he is very similar to Skrowaczewski with the LPO and Sanderling with the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart des SWR. The weight of his phrasing, in combination with his subtle gradation of dynamics, justifies the extra time taken and he brings a real sense of ecstasy to those long, soaring lines, The brass are given their head but don't overwhelm and the sonority of the string playing is a dream.

The Adagio is first tender, wistful and delicate, then rhapsodic as Blomstedt moulds and builds the repeated climaxes with devotion. The Scherzo is broad and joyous, with plenty of spring in it. The Finale is entirely satisfying conclusion to a glorious seventy minutes.

The bonus interview  presumably before a pre-performance audience  is overlong at eighty minutes and might have been judiciously cut. Nonetheless, Blomstedt comes across as wise, genial and devoid of ego. He relates some amusing and enlightening anecdotes, expatiating on his philosophy of music, its purpose, function and effect, and including a lovely little reminiscence illustrating how the most gifted of musicians may sometimes lack insight or emotional maturity, quoting in English an evidently mystified and frustrated member of the San Francisco  Symphony Orchestra who finally asked him, regarding a Bruckner symphony, Maestro, what is this music all about? In another fascinating anecdote he describes the reverential attitude of the audience to music that he encountered in Leipzig and Dresden under the Communist regime and recalls how as a student in New York he gained access via the back door to Carnegie Hall through the good offices of a drugs dealer so that he could hear Toscanini.
