3842022,5,B0023S49RC,"There can be little doubt that the acting of Mark McManus and the stark reality of the city of Glasgow provide an ideal background to these murder mysteries.
  I have collected thus far most of the series where he gives a riveting portrayal of a tough and unrelenting police officer. Thoroughly recommended.",1249776000,4,307,4.884615384615385

8349941,5,B0023S49RC,"I love this whole series, and this set is no exception.  The writing is superb, the plots have complexity and keep you guessing, and the characters are consistently well played (you will recognize many ""old friends"" in the guest casts).  It's a little sad watching the first episode of the set, knowing that it was Mark McManus' last, but the producers made the interesting choice in the next episode of allowing the character to have died suddenly, instead of replacing the actor.  Frankly, no one could have followed Mr. McManus in the role, although his series has continued with a succession of new faces.  One interesting note on the second episode here is that if you pay attention to the dialog, you can tell that a lot of Jardin's more sarcastic lines were meant for Taggart.

Oh, and I should mention (because of some other comments I've read) that if you're not used to the Scots accent, this show is not for you - it takes place in Glasgow, and some of the characters speak in a dialect that some American viewers may find hard to follow.",1391731200,,1049,4.588235294117647
8349942,3,B0023S49RC,"I've always enjoyed British cinema but because of the often sharp accents, I've found them most enjoyable with English subtitles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Single-Handed-Set-2/dp/B006JY3OH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Single-Handed, Set 2</a>& my spouse is hearing impaired. Just rec'd my Taggart Prayer For the Dead DVD set, when prior to opening it I noticed there's no indication of subtitles. Big Disappointment! Unfortunately I'll have to return it & cancel other sets I've ordered & plan to order of this original series starring Mark McManus. Please pass on the recommendation that subtitles truly enhance the viewing experience & increases purchases across the board when it comes to British Drama/Cinema.",1380758400,,760,6.534653465346534
8349943,4,B0023S49RC,"This is volume 11 of the original series.
The proper sequence to view these sets is:
1) KILLER set
2) DEATH CALL set
3) COLD BLOOD set
4) ROOT OF EVIL set
5) EVIL EYE set
6) VIOLENT DELIGHTS set
7) THE HIT MAN set
8) RING OF DECEIT set
9) DEATH WITHOUT DISHONOUR set
10) HELLFIRE set
11) PRAYER FOR THE DEAD set (the last Jim Taggart episode)

I felt a bit cheated with this 2-episode set, BFS is charging the same list price, but giving you only 2/3 of what is on the other sets.
On top of that, DCI Taggart is only in one of the episodes.  If you have not seen this series and want to try it out, i would suggest sets 6 through 10 in the above list instead of this set.
This is the ""swan song"" set for DCI Taggart, you feel the emptiness left by his death.
I guess BFS did not want to start releasing the next phase of the series and bring this set up to 3 episodes.

Again, there are no subtitles to help with the Scottish accents & phrases.",1307923200,4,944,3.931937172774869
8349944,5,B0023S49RC,"The whole series of Taggart is great -- each long enough to fully develop a story, with lots of ""red herrings""! I wish, however, that the series (with Mark McManus et al) was identified chronologically -- this one, for instance, is the LAST in the series starring McManus, and I didn't know this when I ordered it, and watched it.  The sleeve is dated, but you don't know the dates until you've bought it.  Air Date should be in Amazon description.",1287187200,3,448,4.518518518518518
