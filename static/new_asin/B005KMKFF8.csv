8476943,2,B005KMKFF8,"This review is for the Cheezy Flicks release of the movie. The source material for this DVD appears to be a good widescreen print of the film, with color that is not faded, and few other defects. The big problem is the transfer. Cheezy Flicks seems to have scanned the print at a lower resolution than normal. The image is grainy, and the sound is poor. This is an inexpensive DVD, but the quality is just not there.",1501459200,,416,4.346153846153846

8476950,4,B005KMKFF8,"I ordered this DVD used from Amazon and was very pleased.  The DVD, which is actually a DVD-R, is in excellent condition.  The transfer is perfect, the picture is clear and the color is brilliant.  Perhaps the film was re-mastered.  The story is OK.  The title tells it all.  Highly recommended for sword-and-sandal fans.
P.S.: The version I ordered is NOT the Cheezy Flicks DVD release coming out soon.  I can't review that version since I have never seen it.",1391299200,11,460,4.675
8476951,5,B005KMKFF8,"When I bought this movie I was really taking a chance, since I am a collector of SWORD & SANDAL movies I know that many DVDS out there are of poor quality. I was really surprised by this DVD from RETROFLIX. This movie comes in the widescreen format with excellent and pristine color, fantastic musical score, great sound, and though it's dubbed into English not bad at all. This movie must have been remastered. If you like lots of action with some history thrown in it you'll like this movie a lot.",1320364800,20,499,4.434782608695652
