8362553,5,B002BZETAE,"Just watched ""Parks Documentary"" this is one of the most amazing documentary experiences ever. The finale had me practically jumping up cheering. I was screaming! If you've ever been wake boarding. You NEED this movie. I feel amazing after watching this and can't wait to hit the water again!",1262563200,,292,4.979591836734694
8362554,5,B002BZETAE,"This DVD was pretty much what I was hoping for, a great history on not only Parks, but the Bonifay family as well.  I started wakeboarding about 12 years ago and Parks was one of a handful of pros that inspired me to keep pushing myself to be better. I thought I knew a lot about his career but this DVD offered a lot more information that I had never seen or heard before.  I think this is a great buy for anyone just starting or a long time rider who appreciates what Parks has done for the sport.  Although there were tons of his best tricks shown, I wish they would have put in some of his highlight footage or sections from other dvd's, maybe as bonus content.  Other then that, I think this is as close to a 5 star rating as it gets.",1261353600,,739,4.041095890410959
