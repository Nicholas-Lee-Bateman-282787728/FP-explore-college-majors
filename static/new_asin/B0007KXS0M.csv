8047933,3,B0007KXS0M,"This fourteenth volume of the ""'Lost in Space' Collector's Edition"" indicates that by the end of the show's first season they must have been running out of idea because after what was one of the worst episodes, ""The Space Croppers,"" they started ripping off classic stories.  On the slightly bright side, if you ever wanted to see Colonel Klink from ""Hogan's Heroes"" in outer space or ever wondered what happened to the kid who played the youngest Von Trapp child in ""The Sound of Music,"" then this video might have more of an upside for you.  Be aware going in that the first episode features the women of space family Robinson (including Dr. Smith) and the men are in the second.

Episode 26, ""All That Glitters"" (Written by Barney Slater, First aired April 6, 1966) is basically the story of ""The Midas Touch"" told with Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) in the central role.  An alien thief, Ohan (Larry Ward), pops up and grabs Penny (Angela Cartwright), while Dr. Smith does what comes naturally and runs away.  After some fun with monsters (Bob May and Dawson Palmer) attacking the Jupiter II, Penny reveals to Dr. Smith that Ohan has given her a disk that leads to a great treasure.  Meanwhile, Officer Bolix (Werner Klemperer) shows up looking for Ohan but Maureen (June Lockhart) does not like his attitude and does the old ""I see nothing, I know nothing"" routine.  But we learn that Ohan was allowed to escape so Bolix can find the treasure he stole.  However, Penny and Dr. Smith are already there and they discover a ring that turns everything you touch to platinum.  Of course Dr. Smith puts on the ring, of course it turns his food to platinum, and of course he accidentally touches Penny and turns her into platinum as well.  As silly as this all is I will at least give Smith credit for showing true remorse for once.

Episode 27, ""The Lost Civilization"" (Written by William Welch, First aired April 13, 1966) has the men out exploring Prinpalus in the Space Chariot and escaping a lava flow.  Then they endure a whole bunch of earthquakes and discover (you guessed it) a lost civilization underground.  Will (Billy Mumy) finds a little girl who is sleeping and will not wake up.  Fortunately the Robot is there to tell Will he has to kiss the girl, which he does and the Princess (Kym Karath) wakes up.  Of course Will has fulfilled an ancient prophecy and is supposed to marry the princess yadda yadda yadda.  More surprising is that the aliens capture Professor Robinson (Guy Williams) and Major West (Mark Goddard) while they are preparing to conquer the universe starting with Earth.  This cannot be good.  Veteran character actor Royal Dano plays the Major Domo and last episode's monster Dawson Palmer is now a soldier in the army of the princess.

In retrospect it is interesting to recall how ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" was a risk because instead of having a spaceship named ""Enterprise"" (or ""Voyager"") tooling around the universe having adventures you would have a space opera set on a stationary location.  At least ""DS9"" was a nexus for travel.  But does it not seem that Priplanus is a nexus as well?  When the Jupiter II did its spectacular crash landing on the planet it looked like a hostile, barren, deserted world.  At least the barren part stood up.  These are a pair of cute ""Lost in Space"" episodes so your enjoyment of them comes down to how well you tolerate ""cute.""",1113436800,,3401,4.667785234899329
