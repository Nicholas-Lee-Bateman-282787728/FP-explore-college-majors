1409986,5,B00005A07Q,"Hi. I've watched many concerts of her, but this is the best! I think the French audience inspired her a lot. Not to mention she inspired them much more! Ok, don't think twice, if u don't hate Celine, u should see it, no need to be a fan... bY, OZer...",982800000,2,251,4.04
1409987,5,B00005A07Q,"This was a great concert.  If you already have the CD you should by the video too because it includes songs not on the CD.

1409989,5,B00005A07Q,"This DVD is without a doubt the best video I have ever bought. With songs in both French and English, Celine is radiant and beautiful in both voice and body throughout the concert. It includes some of my personal all time favourites, including: JE CROIS TOI; TO LOVE YOU MORE; ON NE CHANGE PAS; POUR QUE TU M'AIME ENCORE and what I consider to be her BEST performance ever of her classic song MY HEART WILL GO ON, which she sings in a gorgeous dress on a stage with railings so it looks like the bow of a ship. The concert alone is unbelievably breathtaking, but along with the behind the scenes videos of the recordings of both Sil Suddisait D'Aimer and Let's Talk About Love it makes it the best way to spend 3hrs and quite possibly one of the best things I have ever bought. Even if you're not an extreme fan of Celine, like me, this DVD is a must get, and can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates good music. In one word: STUNNING!!!!!!",1056672000,9,940,4.286516853932584
1409990,5,B00005A07Q,"I bought this DVD because I really like Celine, she is the best.  Sings so nicely and powerfully in any language, that what better than to see her sing in French too.  I was pleasantly surprised, the Paris concert was amazing, a center stage shaped as a heart, led screened floors (amazing!  wow) and she sings amazingly. Some songs I had not listened to before, and now I play those so I can learn them, even though they are in French.  She does this amazing solo dance of the BEE GEES and she is so cool, has definitely bettered her performance on stage, so exciting for people of any age.  Loved her concert outfits, and she is just so pretty too.  All this means it is a success!  Celne is the best singer of all times, now you just have to really listen to her.
A great DVD - sound is alright (one song near the beginning does not look so great but that is because of all the lights going on) but a definite must buy for the collection.  I wish I had been there!",1050624000,3,967,4.161290322580645
1409991,4,B00005A07Q,A joy to listen to some of the beautiful songs.  Only a few of her songs are in English.  It should be stipulated that most of her songs are in French and all her comments to the audience are in French.  At least there should be subtitles in English for a non-French audience when she speaks or make comments.,1050019200,6,309,4.203389830508475
1409992,5,B00005A07Q,"This feature is a MUST HAVE for all those fans out there who are so serious about Cline! Those of us out there will not even take into consideration that much of the DVD is in french.
Titles from her french album ""S'il Suffisait D'aimer"" are brilliant. Titles that are in english like ""I'm Your Angel"", ""Love Can Move Mountains"" and ""The Power of Love"". Song titles that have highlighted the still growing success of her career. Her true talent continues to shine throughout the entire feature. When I watched this, I couldn't sit still. I was filled with so much joy and love and passion, that only Cline fans know about and experience.
The awesome spectrum of talent shines brightly in this feature. Which makes it almost like gold to the extremely avid fan. She does perform some in english, which are spectacular.
If you were there for her ""Let's Talk About Love"" tour, it will take you back. And if you weren't? Don't worry, this will give you the feeling of being there with thousands and thousands of other fans.
You CANNOT pass this one by! This is no doubt, hands down, absolute must have!! An excellent feature, and even more marvelous of Cline Dion!",1046995200,5,1160,4.608695652173913
1409993,5,B00005A07Q,"Oh my God.. this is the best DVD I ever bought.. And yes I had to make a big effort cause this DVD isn't available in Southamerica, but it worth it.
If you like Cline, or even if you are just getting to know her, you MUST buy this.  I first bought the Audio-CD edition of the concert, and I thought that was almost all. But I was wrong! if you live outside US it may be more expensive, but you gotta do the effort to have it..
I wish I could've been there live!
In just two words: Outstanding; Wonderful",1037664000,8,503,3.98019801980198
1409994,5,B00005A07Q,"This is far the best Celine Dion you can get! It's awesome, it's so much fun to watch, and the extras are good!! The Let's Talk About Making has a lot of info, and video clips!! You have to get this!!",1036886400,,200,3.902439024390244
1409995,1,B00005A07Q,"Il existe des ultrasons que seules les oreilles extrment fines de certains animaux comme le chien peuvent entendre.
J'ai souhait que Cline chante dans la gamme des ultra-sons quand j'ai cout cet horrible concert.
Non seulement n'a-t-elle aucune prsence sur scne mais ses frquents dbordements de fausse sincrit flagrants m'ont horipils.
Mais si ce n'tait que a... Malheureusement, Cline bnficie aussi d'un organe vocal tellement puissant et dsagrable qu'on ne peut s'empcher de rver  son prochain cong sabatique. Sa voix est telle que j'ai l'impression que son sjour prochain  Las Vegas servira en fait  tablir un nouveau type d'armement sonore pour l'arme amricaine afin de bombarder Sadam Hussein.
Somme toute, c'est un DVD que j'offrirais sans piti  mon pire ennemi si j'avais vraiment de l'argent  dpenser pour lui rendre la vie plus pnible.",1036540800,,844,5.315789473684211
1409996,5,B00005A07Q,"If Michael Jackson is the king of pop music, then Celine is the definitive Queen. For the naysayers, the clear proof of my assertion is in this DVD, and they will be proved wrong and left speechless. Celine has the whole package: she sings, dances, and entertains, in a wide range of repertoire, with class, versatility, and all these to perfection. The single most important trait that separates an elite singer from others is the ability to convey a unique depth of emotion when performing, and Celine's performance here clearly shows that she is the undisputed reigning Queen of pop music. If you are looking for the highest quality of entertainment, watch any of Celine's videos, and especially this concert. For details on this DVD refer to the other reviewers, however, I would like to note that Celine opens her show with that beautiful white dress shown in the front cover, and she really shines in it as she sings ""Let's Talk About Love.""",1036454400,6,947,4.780487804878049
1409997,4,B00005A07Q,"This Celine Dion DVD concert is interesting to watch.  She sounds great and the Bee Gees ""You Should Be Dancing"" number is a lot of fun.  Recorded in Paris, it is a bilingual experience - half of it is sung/spoken in French.  The video's production is a bit odd: there are some video effects in some places(""streaming"" the image) that seem out of place and kind of funky.  The good news is that there are lots of ""extras"" on the disk, including a terrific behind the scenes documentary on the making of the ""Let's Talk About Love"" album.  What I like most about the documentary is that Celine is very unguarded and natural - so many times in interviews she tends to be performing even when naturalness is appropriate. It's fascinating to see the ""guest stars"" in the documentary as well.  Particularly the classy George Martin.  I bought the DVD for the Streisand ""Tell Him"" footage.  The entire ""Tell Him"" video is included on this disk, as well as some rarely seen footage of Barbra, Celine, David Foster, and the ""Tell Him"" lyricists gabbing around the piano -- it's all a bit awkward and tries to be ""unrehearsed"", but is still fun to see.",1032739200,6,1143,4.568627450980392
1409998,4,B00005A07Q,"Great show, big stadium, great sound, great production.
Maybe a bit too much French stuff for the overall international market, but still, a great DVD to have in your collection.",1032393600,3,178,4.966666666666667
1410002,4,B00005A07Q,"What great value for money this DVD is!. The concert is obviously the main feature here, and as great as it is, several of the songs will probably only be familiar to the more hardcore fan. I think if more songs from her two album releases (Falling into you & Let's talk about love) prior to this concert had been included, I would have definitely have given a full 5 stars. Nevertheless, what is here is still good - highlights being To love you more, Je sais pas, Pour que tu m'aimes encore, and an excellent cover of the Bee Gees classic Stayin' Alive where Celine's voice sounds remarkably similar to Barry Gibb's original vocal!. There's one bit quite early on where Celine talks to the audience in french for a good 5-10 minutes, and I think subtitles would of been nice here, as I didn't have a clue what she was saying!. The concert runs for 1hr and 52 minutes.
What makes this DVD even better though, is the inclusion of two ""behind the scenes"" features on the recording of two of Celine's albums. The best one is the ""Let's talk about love"" one which is about 56 minutes long, and is hugely enjoyable. Special guests include The Bee Gees, Barbra Streisand, Sir George Martin, and Carole King, amongst others. Watch Barry Gibb come close to tears as Celine sings (the excellent) Immortality!. Another highlight for me was seeing Celine recording the song ""Us"" - one of my favourites. This programme alone almost makes the DVD worth buying - and it's an ""extra"" on top of the main concert!. The other behind the scenes feature concentrates on the french album ""S'il suffisait d'aimer"". This one is entirely in french, but it's mostly singing anyway so it doesn't really matter. This programme is about 25 minutes long, and is definitely worth seeing.
A great DVD, super value for money, and probably the best of the Celine Dion DVD's currently available (July '02).",1026432000,5,1873,4.644578313253012
1410003,5,B00005A07Q,This DVD is amazing! It is the best thing I have ever seen. Celine is perfect and everything she does is perfect. GO CELINE!!!!!!!!,1025481600,,131,4.5
1410004,5,B00005A07Q,"Now...  THIS is how every DVD should be.  I am very new to the DVD world and so far, have bought only a handful of DVDs.  But I am beginning to experience just how uneven they can be.  Some DVDs like this one are worth every cent you spend on it.  On the other hand, a few DVDs are a rip off making the buyer wish he only rented the damn thing.  But this is not the case here.  You have got to own this one because I'll tell you right now, you won't watch it only once!
Like I said, especially if you are a big Celine fan as I am, it is worth every penny.  This is the real deal here...  Three and a half hours of entertainment with loads of extra features including two documentaries about the making of two of her albums namely ""S'il suffisait D'aimer"" and ""Let's Talk About Love"" along with the full concert.  The image quality is exceptional and it's as if you have the diva right there in your living room singing only for you.
  I really enjoyed the documentaries which both show Celine in very candid moments recording her albums.  This DVD is the ultimate way of watching the most popular diva in the world performing and singing like no one else on this earth.  And even if you don't speak one word of French, don't be put off by the French title.  There is both an French AND English version and you won't miss a thing.
  This is a truly extroardinary DVD which offers a lot of material and is worth buying all the way.  On another note, we can sense that Celine was tired when she performed the concert and, even though she gave it her all, the concert was recorded in Paris, right around the time her husband Ren was sick with cancer.  You can sense her sadness throughout the concert but in a way, it makes her performance even more impressive and heartfelt.  A year after this, she retired for a while to have a child and get some rest after twenty years of working non-stop.  As you probably know, she just got back on the musical scene very recently with a new album and her legion of fans all over the world couldn't be happier.
  I'll tell ya, you must add this DVD in your collection.  And ""That's the way it is"" folks...",1017100800,4,2140,4.201474201474201
1410005,5,B00005A07Q,"When you hear the words ""Celine Dion""- you automatically think of the word ""diva"". And, that is Celine Dion, a true diva. She is a GREAT singer and person.
""Au Coeur Du Stade""- ""From The Heart of the Stadium"".
I was wondering if this DVD would ever be out in the USA/Canada in the NTSC format. Well, three years later, it finally is! This concert is truely Celine at her best! She performs ""Dans un Autre Monde"",""Let's Talk About Love"",""Je Sais Pas"", and many, many more! The AUDIO CD version excludes most of the English tracks. This DVD puts them back in. Here they are:
""The Reason"",""Treat Her Like A Lady"",""The Power Of Love"", ""I'm Your Angel"". Those sondg would have also been great on CD!
TRUST ME...you'll love this DVD! This is one of my first DVD's to own! ...and let me tell you...it's worth it! ALL THE WAY!
BONUS FEATURES...
It features a ""Karaoke"" version of ""Acoustique Medley"" and the MAKING OF ""S'il suffisait d'aimer"" and ""Let's Talk About Love"".
I LOVE THE LTAL because it has the FULL MUSIC VIDEO to the
""Tell Him"" track with the ledgendary BARBRA STREISAND, Barbra and Celine hit the high notes together! They are truely the best female singers around!
CELINE is making a come-back this year! With a new album in March and another CBS TV special!

1410008,5,B00005A07Q,This concert is amazing! There's nothing more powerful than seeing Celine in concert. I saw her the same year this was recorded and she sang many of the same songs. Seeing this VCD brought back many wonderful memories for me.,999561600,,225,4.65

Celine it's my favorite singer, and it's a great person too.  Here, in Venezuela, we have the hope to she comes and sing to the all fans what she have here. My great experience with Celine, was in the Stade du France, a Paris.

I got tears of joy watching this. I feel that i am connected to her too like her live audience. Although my french is limited but i got her message. Celine is extraordinary,strong impact in a music scene yet she remains so humble. I love her. To celine fans..what are you waiting for!",1198540800,,431,4.684210526315789
7934580,5,B00005A07Q,"Celine Dion can sing a song live and make it sound exactly like the record. She truly is a gifted singer. With that said, Celine is also excellent on stage. She connects with the audience and she remains simple. She doesn't do bikinis, sexy dancers and stuffs, very simple but amazing.

Well, this concert is just ... outstanding, nothing less. You can feel how closer she is to the French audience and how much her fans love her as a person. The best highlight for me was when she informed them that Rene was well. The roar that followed that statement is priceless. In fact they came to the concerts with flyers wisting him ""GET WELL"". You can tell that Celine's fans love her as a person and feel connected to her that way, she is not just another singer, she is part of their lives.

7934585,3,B00005A07Q,"I saw the ENGLISH version of this concert live in Denver at the opening night of the Pepsi Center, Denver, Colorado, USA. I am glad I did not see the concert at the Stadium in Paris. It lost some of intimacy compared to the Denver concert. It helped that I was fourth row center stage. The sound recording was not the best on this DVD again compared to Denver concert. Great voice especially in the French sections but even then she was a little weak compared to Denver. Maybe just the shere size of that Stadium.

The additional sections on this DVD a GREAT though.  The studio recordings of "" Lets Talk about Love "" and her French Album.

"" S'il Suffisait D'aimer "" were truly the best part of this DVD. EXCELLENT. Nice to see the behind scenes and commentaries. I re-play these sections more than the concert.",1137110400,3,812,4.436241610738255
7934586,5,B00005A07Q,"I was worried when I first purchased this because it is a french DVD and the only French I speak is Bonjour and Merci; however, Celine's sheer vocal perfection shines through no matter what language you speak.  With a sensational blend of uptempo and smooth slow songs this concert is a treasure!  The gigantic audience surrounding the stage adds to the excitment flowing throughout the show.  After the duet with Jean-Jacque Goldman it is touching to hear him, along with the entire stadium serenade Celine.  What only adds to this great show is the behind the scenes footage.  It includes time in the recording studio for the making of the severly multiplatinum ""Let's Talk About Love"" and ""Sil Suffisait d'Aimer"". My only complaint about this DVD is not being able to understand what Celine is saying between songs.  Other than that, great buy!",1134950400,3,847,4.888111888111888
