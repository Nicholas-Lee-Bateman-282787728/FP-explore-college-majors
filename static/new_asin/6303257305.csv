I must say that this Dvd version dissapointed me a lot;I thought of great extras but instead there's only film trailers of another movies from the studio and also the sound is in Dolby Surround Stereo instead of 5.1

Just watching her bounce around on that zebra bareback is fun to watch. Its sexy how she talks to the animals, and I don't even know what the main point is I just watch it for sheena riding in the jungle.",994896000,9,352,4.132352941176471
611579,3,6303257305,"Ok, I can say I liked this movie. Tanya Roberts does a a good job in the title role as ""Sheena."" I can also say, this is not Tanya's best work.
If I had to categorize this flim I'd call it a  Romance/Action-Drama. Something this movie has going for it is the eye  catching scenery. It's beautiful! The interaction with the animals is  amazing!
Though I enjoyed this movie, I feel I should should state, this  movie is not for everyone. As I was watching this film the one thing that  kept running through my mind was... ""Sheena-- A female Tarzan.""  That is the BEST way I can describe this film.
If you like Tanya Roberts,  or enjoy Tarzan movies you will probably like this movie.",958608000,20,681,4.357142857142857

Explaining to an eight-year-old about people deep in the jungle having never invented shirts is one thing, and not so bad when the images were fleeting and set in the dark of night, but then the story developed a bit.

When the blonde showed her bottom, and then the side of her breast, and then her entire chest, in broad daylight, I found myself compelled to provide a great deal more guidance than I had anticipated.

612018,4,6303257305,"It is the job of a film critic to assess what works visually upon the screen, and in that respect, 1984's ""Sheena"" has much to offer! Tanya Roberts is at her beautiful best--not what you would call a performance, traditionally, but if you are interested in a good time, ""Sheena"" offers it in spades. Yes, the plot is soap-opera influenced, and some of the dialogue is (intentionally?) silly, but again it comes down to what there is to see. One not only gets an eye-full of the delightful Roberts in all of her natural glory (there are two or three fully nude scenes of her that expose her real talents) but one also gets to see the gorgeous location photography in Kenya (today, filmmakers would probably go for CGI instead of actually going out into the field to do the work). Pauline Kael actually recognized the merits of this picture, and she was probably one of the few critics at the time of the film's release to successfully do so, pointing out the excellent cinematography and adventure scenes. The music score too, composed by Richard Hartley, (which is now a very collectible CD pressing) elevates the drama of the picture without going for a bloated superhero movie sound. While the script, the directing, and the story might not impress you at all, this is one visual experience that cannot easily be forgotten, whether it is in your will to take it seriously or not.
My major complaint rests with the quality of this DVD print. My copy looks grainy and speckled, as if a ratty VHS print has been used to transfer the title onto a full-frame DVD format. ""Sheena"" is definitely a picture that needs to be seen in widescreen! Like another mid-80's classic that is now sadly neglected, ""The Emerald Forrest"" also suffered a full-frame transfer to VHS instead of getting the fair widescreen transfer treatment that it deserved. There is also a shocking lack of extras--I think a 'making of' on ""Sheena"" would have been great fun to see, and I know that HBO must have done some interviews with the stars of the film--and why, oh why, is there no audio commentary? Does everyone feel such contempt for this film that they don't want to remember it? Geez.
So, overall, I like the movie a lot but this is a disappointing DVD version. More than just a young boy's masturbatory fantasy, ""Sheena"" is interesting for its humor, its cinematography, and for its ultimate ideas (which, admittedly, don't always come across). Sadly, though, like the great Swamp Thing character, no one seems to know how to treat the Sheena character when adapting her to the big (or small) screen. But this movie is a memorable experience.

612019,4,6303257305,"I've never seen anything quite like SHEENA.  It's a film that looks and sounds like an beautifully filmed epic at times.  At other times it looks and sounds like a cheap B-grade Movie.

It has  probably the most nudity of any PG-rated film I've ever seen. Some would say that it's ""tasteful"" or ""non-sexual"" type nudity, but I don't think that's true. Not unless ""non-sexual"" means 'making any man with the pulse drool.'

Some of the scenery is  breathtaking and there's some pretty good actions sequences as well.

The film's main weakness lies in the lead actress's acting ability. Simply put, Tanya Roberts can't act. What she lacks in acting talent she makes up for in sex appeal, however, and it's on full display throughout most of the film.",1382572800,17,747,4.744186046511628

612081,2,6303257305,"Sheena, 1984 film

Men look for a missing girl in a mine in Africa. This girl is adopted by a local tribe as part of a prophecy. [Believable?] Years later she has grown up. [Is that a horse painted to look like a zebra?] In a city two men discuss a mining deal. One king must be removed first. An airplane flies over the land, two men discuss the operation. One of the plotters suffers a heart attack. There is a meting at night. An arrow hit the king in his chest. There is a new king. A reporter wants to interview the arrested woman. An elephant roars, a blonde on a quadruped follows it. The suspect is freed. The new king orders mercenaries to hunt down the shaman. Two photographers drive into the country. Sheena tells them to go back. Animals understand Sheena.

Can Sheena protect her tribe against the foreigners who seek to exploit their minerals? Will the usurper get his just desserts? Will the mercenaries eliminate the threat from those reporters? Some animals take part in the action too! Those soldiers continue searching. Sheena and the reporters flee to a safe place. But this village is attacked! In time they are captured by the mercenaries. Can they make a deal over that film? Can Sheena summon help? Can a flock of birds save Sheena? Yes (you've got to see it). Can spears and arrows triumph over machine guns and rifles? Yes (if its in the script). ""I was only following orders."" Can the new king get away? Can Sheena be saved by Mr. Casey? Will there be a happy ending? What bad things will happen if the outside world learns about that healing earth? Casey and the others return to the outside world. Sheena remains with her tribe.

Aside from the implausible and unbelievable parts of this movie, it is a morality play where good people survive and the villains perish. Aside from the setting, this basic story reminds me of some of the Western from the 1930s (people triumph over those who attack them). How different from reality?",1373587200,,1960,4.5625

612144,4,6303257305,"This is one of those guilty-pleasure movies you're almost ashamed to admit you liked.  It's a somewhat sexier update (there are two scenes of Sheena bathing nude, though no full-frontals) of the Irish McCalla classic series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sheena-Queen-Of-The-Jungle-Volumes-One-through-Three/dp/B001ED3JKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sheena Queen Of The Jungle: Volumes One through Three</a>, which I actually think I prefer.  But its great selling point is that it suggests *how* Sheena came to be in the jungle in the first place.  Orphaned at four when her parents were killed in a rockfall, a little girl named Janet Ames is taken in by the female Shaman (Elizabeth of Toro)--known only by her title--of the Zambouli tribe somewhere in central Africa.  She learns all the skills of wilderness life and is taught how to communicate mentally with animals--not just the higher mammals, but at least some of the reptiles (there's a great little shot of little Sheena with a big boa curled protectively around and under her).  20-odd years later, Vic Casey (Ted Wass), a cocky American journalist, and his cameraman, Fletch (Donovan Scott), arrive in the independent Kingdom of Tigora to do a story on Prince Otwani (Trevor Thomas), the American-schooled, football-playing, and possibly Super-Bowl-bound brother of King Jabalani (Clifton Jones).  Tigora, like many African countries, is dominated by one tribe but home to various others, including the Zambouli, whose main village lies in the shadow of Kuchar Mountain, the source of a wondrous ""healing earth.""  Otwani, eager to make his fortune from the stuff, has entered into a conspiracy with his brother's fiancee (France Zobda) and imported a group of mercenaries under Col. Jorgensen (John Forgeham) with the view in mind of assassination and coup.  Shaman, who has had visions of the plot, arrives in the capitol just in time to play into his hands and be framed for the King's murder.  Unknown to the plotters, Fletch has captured the truth on tape, and when he and Vic head for the prison in hopes of getting Shaman's side of the story, they're just in time to witness Sheena (Tanya Roberts) and her animal friends breaking the woman out.  Now it's a race against time as Vic and Sheena head off together to warn the Zambouli while Fletch and his young native assistant Juka (Sylvester Williams) try to get the tape out of the country and prove Otwani's perfidy.

It's been said by other reviewers that Roberts's acting skills are limited, but to me that just made her more convincing as an innocent (if sexy) ""child of nature.""  Her zebra is obviously a horse in disguise, but in a world where a ""healing earth"" exists, perhaps there's another species of Hippotigris that provides a missing link between stripey equids and mainline ones.  The Zambouli may not be politically correct, but they're a fierce and noble people, rather Zulu-like (herders, hunters, warriors, and bowmen whose reputation goes back to 80,000-odd BCE), who play an important role in the resolution of the story--as does Vic, who discovers depths in himself that he probably never knew existed.  There's one reference to the Twin Towers (visible from Vic's New York loft--the movie was made some 17 years before they fell), plus the abovementioned nudity.",1350518400,,3348,5.268796992481203

The scenery was beautiful (both the African landscape and Tanya Roberts). It was shot on location in Kenya. I always like films shot on location more than those that create a ""location"" using CGI mumbo jumbo. There's no substitute for being there. The characters were likeable and the story was fast paced and entertaining. The two nude scenes were tasteful, simply showing Sheena bathing in a waterfall and lake. Cheesy elements that added to the fun include the ridiculous dialogue already mentioned by other reviewers, Sheena's Dr. Doolittle animal mind control routine, and the ""zebra"" she rode, actually a horse, as zebras have never been domesticated.

This happened with The Long Shot and it happened now to Sheena. When I buy a new computer (mine still has 98SE and the old IE version) I will resume. I had taped this movie from AMC but they had censored out all the nude scenes which I thought was criminal on their part since, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, they were all innocent with nothing offensive about them, so I was glad to purchase the uncut version on a DVD. I liked how Tanya introduced herself to Vic and so used it as my title line. While Roberts, Wass, Elizabeth of Torro, the actor playing the prince and the actress playing his breathtaking cohort played their parts well, I had enjoyed Donovan Scott as George Hamilton's sidekick in Zorro, the Gay Blade and enjoyed him in Sheena. I thought the water diet in keeping with his character. How about when he came face to face with a male lion? This movie may deserve to be called campy, but I found the action scenes, the natives, and the unsuccessful attempt to kill Sheena (thwarted by the flamingos she summoned) exciting, and the growing relationship between Sheena and Vic pleasurable and funny. Yes, you have to wait until Sheena is grown before seeing the opening credits, but watching her emerge from a toddler to a young lady is worth the wait. I had to laugh when, after the Shaman brings forth an elephant, young Sheena brings forth a hedgehog. Later, watching her summon her African wildlife to rescue the shaman, you see her communication has developed. In the end, though they had fallen in love with each other, Vic returns to his home environment while Sheena remains with her animals. The score was divine and one of my favorites.

Tune in to TCM and in short time, you'll see the interviews with

Sidney Pollack, Morty Scorcese, Michael Mann & Curtis Hanson all

bringing views that anyone can understand about the ongoing butchery of films that are still ""..modified to fit your screen""

Actually, the TV needs to be modified to fit the film - they make commercials in letterbox now but they still cut films to fit TV screens - it's a pathetic irony.

That this DVD of Sheena is only available in full screen is akin to stealing that so called ""Eye Candy"" from true fans of this film.

ever is responsible for this ""failure to respond.....""?????!

612334,4,6303257305,"With slight modifications, Sheena is basically just a female version of Tarzan, my all-time favorite fictional character. Everyone pretty much knows going in that the plot, dialog and acting of a film like this will be of the ""B"" movie variety, and it is, sort of like Indiana Jones but a bit less compelling. What's magnificent, awe-inspiring and ""A"" level are the African locations (Kenya), the score and Tanya Roberts.

Seriously, if you're bored with your every-day locale this movie is the perfect antidote. It's virtually a two-hour tour of some of the most gorgeous African scenery you'll ever feast your eyes upon. As for the score, it's pleasant and meditative; reminiscent of ""Chariots of Fire."" Regarding Tanya Roberts, what can I say? She's stunning.

I never concern myself with ratings when watching films, but I couldn't help but be a little surprised by the PG rating here because Sheena (Roberts) is shown TOTALLY nude on a number of occasions and prances around throughout the flick in a ridiculously skimpy leather bikini; but then it struck me that it's portrayed in an inoffensive way like Eve in Eden before the fall and the consequent awareness of evil. In other words, there's an almost child-like innocence and purity to Sheena even though she's a quite skilled warrior. I commend the film-makers for successfully capturing this quality. For this reason I personally don't feel the movie is inappropriate for kids, despite the nudity.

My rating of B- reflects the happy medium between the Grade C plot, dialog & acting and the Grade A African locations, score and Ms. Roberts.

NO SPOLIERS

It's difficult to have no spoilers when you can sort guess almost the entirety of the story. It's a sort of #### don't read the next line if you DONT want to know anything about it - in which case how did you get thtis far??? ####### Tarzan and Jane story with the roles reversed.

Picture quality good. sound good. scenery ok in parts good in others and outstanding in one or two shots of the landscape. and some of the 'mood' shots Like Sheena thundering along as fast as a Zebra can thunder along, were quite impressive. I don't know where I picked this up from allegedly it is supposed to be quite hard to ride a zebra but Ms Roberts does it without a flinch and indeed gives the impression she was born to.

Some of the score is like wallpaper and some is mildly inspiring.

Dialogue/script is pitched quite effectively - not too much in the Weismuller vein -  ""boy speak English boy English"" - and not so sophisticated tat you forget your in deepest darkest Africa.

It's easy to see how this has been tv series fodder. And kudos to Ms Roberts who seems to have totally thrown herself into this role and done it and her justice. So much so that in order to sell the film would have been too much a leap from episodic tv to the big screen to get the audiences in they had to add an element of 'what you won't get on the tv'. This ingredient, turns out to be 'appeal' in the form of Ms. Roberts' s good self. Much in the mould of Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom based series of books of the 30's where the 'I still live....' hero John Carter is nude (he was transported to mars not his possessions/clothes) Here too Ms. Roberts is - once or twice - partially clothed. And her hair does look like she just stepped out the parlour. Is this a cop out? is it pandering? Actually I have to say no. Very little of it - if any - was done in a gratuitous or voyeuristic manner. On the contrary it was done in a very 'natural' way which only served to reinforce the innocence of a person raised not in 'civilisation'. Subtle but it works well. More it says much for Ms. Roberts that she so invested in the character that it didn't seem 'oi-oi' at all but actually heart warming and innocent.

action. there is bit of action. but it's largely in the arena of the A-Team. there are one or two deaths  but nothing that scar ones psyche. Mostly there a stunt sequences. And a lot of animal interaction. they must have landed luck on stock footage or got some excellent handlers.

All in all an oft misunderstood classic that'll leave you feeling life isn't all bad
