4685711,4,B005FT2MJ8,Arrived in good condition in a timely fashion.  These films are great fun--good plot twists and lots of action.  My only regret is that they are not cose-captioned.  Thank you.,1351555200,,176,4.8
4685712,3,B005FT2MJ8,"I enjoyed these ""different"" movies- back when they first came out too. Part of my ""brain re-awakening"" process! The ""2-pack"" was a great value also!",1345334400,2,148,4.96
4685713,2,B005FT2MJ8,"At I write, this FX double feature DVD is priced about a dollar shy of twenty. Considering how it compares to the original, individual DVD releases of both of the shows it contains -- both released in 2000 -- it should be priced considerably lower. In fact, it retails at a popular American big box store for the princely sum of about five bucks, so when Amazon and its Marketplace sellers are able to match that, then you might consider it worth buying. Emphasis on ""might"".  EDIT SEPT 30/2013: prices have dropped considerably on this title from Marketplace sellers; the only decision you need to make now is whether you can tolerate these films in compromised but watchable condition, or wait for (hopefully) a decent Blu-ray double feature.

If you're looking for plot synopses or reviews of these clever action thrillers, refer to the individual listings for the 2000 DVDs here on Amazon, or better yet the IMDB or MRQE, where you'll find plenty of reasons why you might enjoy them. THIS review is strictly a basic technical overview of the ""2-Pack Action"" edition released in 2012, with specs for the earlier editions provided for comparison's sake. Those who own the previous editions are advised to hang on to them, and not just because they appear to be out of print. This new ""2-pack"" is really a ""1-pack"", with both films crowded onto a single disc and stripped of options and special features:

F/X, F/X 2 2-Pack Action SPECS:
Single sided, dual layer
Anamorphic Widescreen Presentations
English audio only
No subs
No trailers

Further thoughts: upon insertion, the disc boots to a static menu, allowing you to choose either F/X on the left, or F/X 2 on the right. The lion's roar audio (and ONLY the audio) from the MGM Home Video logo plays UNDERNEATH this menu for some reason. Choosing a title from this menu ONLY plays that movie instead of taking to you a sub-menu. This is because all options available on the previous editions, sparse though they were, have been removed. More importantly, there are compression issues (softness, pixellation during action scenes, ""swarmy"" patches, for lack of a better term) on this double feature, which will be readily apparent on larger screens. While the double feature DOES present both films with anamorphic enhancement -- whereas the original discs were NON-anamorphic -- a compromise appears to have been made in picture quality. The image will now fill your screen, but depending on its size, you may not like what you see.

Though the DVD case bears the logos of MGM and Fox, current owners of these pictures, the discs are manufactured and distributed by an outside contractor called TGG Direct, LLC (aka The Garr Group) that has been bundling up lesser MGM catalog titles for a few years now to help keep the Wal-Mart DVD dump bins overflowing. They also specialize in releasing those ubiquitous, low-bitrate DVD ""collections"" of public domain junk similarly favored by fellow fringe dwellers like Mill Creek and Echo Bridge, companies that have strengthened their foothold in retail store bargain sections in recent years by licensing mainstream (albeit second- and third-tier) titles from major studios no longer interested in bringing deep catalog movies to disc-based formats. Thus my comments at the top of this review that Amazon's price, and by association those of its Marketplace sellers, is highly inflated.

For comparison, here are the specs from the 2000 editions of the F/X films:

F/X - 2000 DVD release SPECS:
Double sided
NON-anamorphic Widescreen and Fullscreen Presentations
English, Spanish audio
French, Spanish subs
Theatrical Trailer
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-X/dp/0792845781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F/X</a>

F/X 2 - 2000 DVD release SPECS:
Double sided
NON-anamorphic Widescreen and Fullscreen Presentations
French, Spanish subs
Trailer
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-X-2-The-Deadly-Art-of-Illusion/dp/079284579X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F/X 2 - The Deadly Art of Illusion</a>

Finally, if you already own these, they may be worth keeping, mainly for the trailers, but also because zooming on their non-enhanced pictures on your flatscreen TV may result in essentially the same image quality you'll get with the double feature version from TGG. Until something better comes along -- preferably a Blu-ray double feature given at least the kind of passable treatment Mill Creek and Echo Bridge have been giving their studio catalog acquisitions over the past couple of years -- your choices for these films on disc are limited to the variant DVD editions, all of which are compromised in some way.",1339459200,22,4677,5.335142469470828

4685735,5,B005FT2MJ8,"Innovative, fascinating, and ever so entertaining. This is an ever so brief glimpse into the art of cinematic special effects coupled with two terrific mystery stories. The protagonist is not overbearing, macho, or even particularly in control outside of his world of ""cine-magic"", and at times it is quite easy to be sympathetic to his plight. He is confronted with situations, one that is very tragic, and must react, and he does so with the ""weapons"" he knows best; illusions. It is not overly cerebral, and it is quite satisfying. This is an excellent duo to watch on an intimate date night at home relaxing with a chilled bottle of wine. Minimal violence, nothing overly gratuitous, some scuffling, and a reasonably HEA (Happily Ever After) ending. It is the best combination of a guy-flick and a chick-flick I know. I am so confident that you would enjoy it, that if I sold it to you I would provide a complete satisfaction guarantee.",1431648000,4,940,4.808641975308642

4685748,3,B005FT2MJ8,"Not much I can say about the two movies on this single DVD, F/X was a phenomenal movie and F/X2 was a not-so-good tolerable sequel.  The 3 stars are generously for the content, not the actual DVD production and setup.  The movies in this below bargain sub-basement third-party DVD release need better treatment than they receive here.

No extra features, not even a trailer.  No scene selection menu, no subtitles.  The two moves are highly compressed so they barely require a dual-layer format, and end up being barely better viewing than VHS and comparable to defunct Laser Disc.

The only justifications for buying this was the price ($4) and the anamorphic 16 : 9 TV aspect ratio.  If you don't own either movie (or both) then this is a good starter pack while we wait for the copyright owners to provide a better release, DVD and Blu-ray.",1412726400,4,843,4.6938775510204085
