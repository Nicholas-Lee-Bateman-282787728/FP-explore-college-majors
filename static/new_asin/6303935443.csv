733800,4,6303935443,"Long John Willoghby ( Cooper) is chosen by crass media folk( James Gleason , Barbara Stanwyck) to be an "" everyman"" that will sell  newspapers.
This is a Capra film so what is in the bargain is not always  apparent. A John Doe society is started with national appeal by magnate  Edward Arnold and friends. Their scheme is to use the John Does to  political advantage ( not so far fetched in todays political arena) . In  order to prove himself not a fraud,  (Cooper) Doe, decides to commit  suicide.
The political undertones are here. Comic relief is offered by  ""The Colonel"".... Walter Brennan who calls the rest of them  healots. Surely it was difficult to end this film with a satisfactory  windup..and it does leave one hanging a bit. However, the sincere acting is  worth the time . Pure Capra",965001600,2,799,4.595744680851064
733801,5,6303935443,"This 1941 Frank Capra classic appears to be public domain, for there have been several VHS and DVD editions released by different companies. The Laserlight DVD release is probably your best choice if you want to own a  copy of this wonderful movie on video.  Whereas some buyers seem to  complain about the poor picture quality of, for instance, the Madacy  release, I see no reason to complain about this one.  The picture may not  be so impeccably crisp and clear as one might expect from DVD, since it was  evidently not transferred from a print in mint condition, but it is by no  means scratched or blotted.  At times it seems, indeed, to be very slightly  grainy, specially in the first half of the movie, but by and large I'd say  it is  more than acceptable, unless you're an absolute perfectionist in  that respect. The sound is also loud, clear and intelligible, although it  of course contains the inevitable imperfections of any old analog  recording.

As for the movie itself -- in case you don't know it yet --  though it has been often underrated by some critics, it certainly deserves  to be ranked among Capra's masterpieces, along with ""Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington"" and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"".  Like those  movies, ""Meet John Doe"" reveals Capra's unswerving faith in  democracy and in the essential American virtues, and his conviction that  your average everyman can beat the powers of money and corruption if he  only believes in those basic values. This same kind of David-versus-Goliath  story, in which ordinary people, united, triumph over the rich and  powerful, had been indeed a constant in Capra's movies since as early as  1932's ""American Madness"" (which you shouldn't miss either, if  you like this one).

As a bonus, the DVD includes a 30-min documentary on  Gary Cooper's career, consisting basically of ten uncut original or  re-release theatrical trailers of Cooper's films (including ""High  Noon"", ""Pride of the Yankees"", ""Sergeant York"",  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Vera Cruz"").  The  narration is interesting and well-written, though it does not include any  information Cooper fans don't already know.

Foreign customers will be  glad to know that this is an ""all-region"" DVD, which means that  it is playable in any of the six reagions, provided that you have a  NTSC-compatible player and TV set.",961113600,19,2345,4.912820512820513
733802,5,6303935443,"Angered because she has been fired, newspaper columnist, Ann Mitchell (Stanwyck) fabricates and has printed in her final column a phoney letter signed by ""John Doe"", in which the writer announces that he is going to commit suicide on Christmas Eve as a protest against all the misery, hypocrisy and corruption which exist in the country...........MEET JOHN DOE made its timely appearance in 1941; it warned, in an entertaining way, of the dangers of Fascism. Down and out, Coop is picked by Stanwyck and he's promoted into a massive newspaper publicity stunt. Under Stanwyck's guidance, he becomes JOHN DOE, the people's mouthpiece, championing the cause of decency and fair play in a country pickled in misery, corruption and hypocrisy. Besides Cooper and Stanwyck doing their usual excellent work, Edward Arnold scores as the power-crazed newspaper editor and James Gleason is zesty as the paper's no-nonsense managing editor. Capra's direction is brilliant; he really knew how to take the little man and picture him in all his simplicity, with all his ambitions, desires, heartaches, and laughter.  The acting, too, is brilliant.  In a role which seems tailor made for  Cooper, he gives a terrific performance (some say he deserved his Oscar for this rather than for Sergeant York (I personally disagree!) Stanwyck is  lovely here as the lively columnist; she too, gives a great performance.  Despite its slightly disappointing ending, the rest of the supporting cast shine through: Walter Brennan, Regis Toomey, Gene Lockhart (father of June) and Spring (December Bride) Byington.",959385600,2,1584,5.294820717131474

733915,5,6303935443,"When this film was released in 1941, the Nazis threat to freedom and democracy was more and more growing in the middle of WWII. Given this, Frank Capra was no longer optimistic about film-making like when he made Mr. Deeds Goes to Town some years before. Looking at the big difference of characters between John Doe and Longfellow Deeds, both of which are played by Gary Cooper, it is evident that things had dramatically changed. The anti-Nazism sentiment is well mirrored in the characterization of Edward Arnolds D.B. Norton. He tries to do everything he can to take power and debauches the John Doe movement, but the media manipulation eventually failed to unexpected populism. It is interesting to see this overlapping what is happening across the globe.

Cooper is fantastic as an ordinary guy in the role of John Doe who is awakened by his bitter experience after beguiled. Wordy idealism is lackluster though. Barbara Stanwyck is incredibly sublime as reporter Anne Mitchel. Her rapport with Cooper is conspicuous here again.",1491782400,3,1033,5.04093567251462

734207,4,6303935443,"No question during the late 1930s, early 1940s before Pearl Harbor closed everything down but patriotic stuff and shoulder to the wheel beat the hellish Nips and Nazis took over (an admirable goal the question was what was to happen with this good green earth after those bastards got tanked) there was a certain amount of social commentary in Hollywood films reflecting an understanding that while the movie-goers wanted their plots sugar-coated they could stand up to a little good-natured fun about their desperate situations toward the end of the Great Depression. Warner Brothers for a time had serious social dramas by the score about working conditions, the plight of the average Joe and about the lives of men and woman of common clay. The serious social commentary work maybe didn't last long once the class struggle heated up-when those of ordinary clay in places like Chicago, Detroit, Akron got angry and decided to do something about their fates instead of just talking about it on the assembly line or tool shed and the movie producers started seeing reds under all the beds and reined in the serious stuff. The good-natured fun of the romantic comedy if sometimes acerbic and arcane as the film under review, Meet John Doe, demonstrates in full never lost its foothold though.

No question too lots of people who never thought they would see the unemployment line or the soup kitchen got a rude comeuppance in the 1930s. Take a guy like John Doe, not his real name, played by Gary Cooper whose wing gave out (his pitching arm gave out for those less sanguine sports aficionados) and wound up on the scape heap doing the best he could which was not too good when the deal went down. And like a lot of guys (gals too but we will concentrate on the guys here) who hit the roads during that time he ran into a guy, the Colonel, played by Walter Brennan, who became his road buddy, who tried might and main to keep him on an even keel (to no avail as one would suspect). Together they did the best they could until one day they heard, who knows how they heard but the railroad jungle grapevine like the teenage schoolboy and girl grapevine was pretty accurate, would be the envy of every CIA and NSA operative that a newspaper, a big city newspaper was looking for the John Doe anonymous author of a suicide note. Said in the note he was going to jump off the Empire State Building in hectic New Jack City to protest the inequities of the world. Was going to atone for the sins of mankind if you want top to put a slightly different spin on the matter. So penniless and not proud our John Doe (remember not his real name) showed up at the newspaper office with about ten thousand other shiftless bums to claim the prize.

Of course neither he nor the others knew that this suicide note was the dreamt up story from the imagination of a newspaper gal, Ann, who had been sacked as redundant by her employers agent and was fighting to get her job back. Her idea was to drive up circulation by getting the readers of the day to follow the exploits of the soon-to-be suicide John Doe-the peoples avenger (sound familiar with the doings of the lords of the fourth estate), a living symbol of what bothered and bewildered them about everyday life. So John met Ann. John agreed, pressed under by his then current bedraggled condition, to go along with the gag. And so the fireworks begun. You know the fireworks between the fetching Ann and the good-looking silent type John.

That, in the end, was the real story line but get this John started buying into the gag, decided that since people were taking him seriously he would act as a conduit for their frustrations, began some boosteristic clubs to express social solidarity. But John Doe got too big for his britches, began to take in an idea that things could change if people of ordinary clay stuck together. That however ran afoul of the intentions of the newspaper boss (played by perennial 1930s business executive heavy, Edward Arnold) to use the clubs as the springboard for his own political ambitions. One night at a big-time rally John was exposed as fraud and the whole thing seemed to collapse over his head. Being a stand-up guy John Doe decided to take that dreamt up leap to maintain his credibility. Go to it John, make the bosses pay.

Wait a minute didn't you read above that this was a Frank Capra romantic comedy. No way was John leaping off anything higher that the steps of a bus. Not as long as the now smitten Ann had a breath in her body. Naturally although the class struggle took a back seat in the love business Ann stopped John in his tracks before he did anything foolish. And she did. That sounds familiar too. This one you want to watch as you see pros going through their paces in one of the top snappy and witty romantic comedies ever. Kudos Frank, Gary, Barbara, Walter and hell even Edward.",1460592000,,4881,4.555808656036446

734312,2,6303935443,"Yes I have donned my flak vest and helmet in preparation, but it must be said that this movie is PONDEROUSLY LONG!
Really in need of some sharp editing to sustain interest and stop you glazing over during some of the most protracted speeches ever committed to film.
And they really aren't all that great it must be said.

About midway, one bloke actually says ""Aw, I'm talking too much..."", to which the viewer will MOST heartily agree, but then he immediately launches into another very long speech.
The leads are fine.
Stanwyck at her best in the beginning as the feisty reporter about to be sacked, who dreams up the idea (and sells it!) of inventing a fake persona who can freely criticise society and boost the ailing circulation of the paper.
She's somewhat less effective towards the end when she falls in love with the bloke hired to play ""John Doe"".
""Stanners"" had many talents but playing the weepy, fainting love-struck maiden was never one of them.

Gary Cooper is suitably laconic, ...as he always is, but here it suits the part. His speeches are all written for him and his performance is believable, but there's a face-grimacing pantomime bit when he performs a mimed baseball game that seems some attempt at humour, ....NOT Cooper's strongpoint either.
Mention must be made of three ""stooges"", who seem to have no other function but to stand around in the background, act dumb, and make stagey facial expressions, or fall over things. (Yes, he does it twice in case you missed it!)
The rest of the cast contains some very famous faces.
Walter Brennan playing his usual grizzled old-timer,...even Sterlng Holloway gets a small part as a Soda Jerk.
The ""villain"" of the piece is a quasi-Nazi Hermann Gring look-a-like....he even has his own private army of black uniformed, jack-booted ""S S"" troops to carry out his orders.
They even perform a Nuremburg Rally style synchronised motorcycle display under the eye of their master early on.
If you're seeking subtlety, this isn't it I'm afraid.
Naturally Mr Gering lives his own Bavarian Schloss, decorated in the best style Nazi looting could provide.

OK so it's all about how the ordinary man gets used and manipulated by the corrupt and powerful establishment.
Capitalism reigns supreme?
Hardly big news, ...more like a way of life nowadays.
Of course the rich and powerful tries to ride in on the coat-tails of the highly egalitarian, but hugely nave spoutings of the John Doe puppet, who as the movement grows, tries to become a ""real boy"".
The whole thing bogs down in VERY long speeches to camera. What ever happened to ""show, don't tell""?
It's Capra of course, ...a favourite theme of his really, but overall this supposed film remains more of a book than a movie.
The theme is. ...or probably ""was"" relevant, and the leads are great for the most part, but it takes SO damned long to say what it has to say.
(Which could be far more succinctly put, ...and all the more effective for that.)
The attempts at providing comic relief are clumsy, and fail miserably to distract you from glancing at your watch and wondering just how long this thing can take to GET TO THE POINT!
Which you already gleaned about an hour and a half earlier anyway.

Sorry folks, but this one just kept going over and over the same material again and again just to prolong the eventual and highly predictable climax.
Even that's a clich, with an audience of dozens turning up on top of the high building to watch the LONG threatened suicide.
There's the fat Nazi and his all minions in evening dress, Stanwyck of course, ...although she's apparently ""dying"" and passes out after her teary speech, ...even the feller who talks too much and all his friends from the sticks drive for hours to be there and manage to get into the building at night to be at the very stagey party on top. Did they send out invitations?

By this staged piece I was so familiar with the theme, and its repetition and over-extension, and being belted around the head with the single idea it contains ....I really began to hope he'd JUMP! (With Stanners in his arms of course!)

Just TWO stars from me, BUT it COULD have been engrossing and worth much more if it had been edited!

It belongs in any serious film collection and the Restored VCI 70th Anniversary DVD is as good a print as will likely ever be available. The film was not a box office money maker and Frank Capra sold its rights, along with the original negative, to an individual who did not properly store it and let the copyright expire. The original negative corroded and the Film is now in the public domain and anyone can sell prints of it, usually poor quality.

734637,5,6303935443,"First, if you're expecting something with all the pyrotechnics of modern movie industry films, including flashing booms of thunderous explosions, cars or trucks or buildings being blown apart, armed spacemen running to and fro in the forefront, and hard rock music blaring beyond decibel range -- then by all means DO NOT torment your scorched conscience to anything here that promotes inner healing, spiritual enhancement, and in touch with soul moments. You're too far gone.

However, if you're hungering for something more than just another film flick to bide your time, then allow me to exhort you to purchase this most wonderful story of redemption, love, and the things that matter most in this life, namely, people! At first, my heart began to sink, when the old black and white movie began, which reveals how much we've become accustomed to ""fast food movies"" (instant gratification). But as the story unfolded, I felt a lump growing in my throat, and tears welling up in my eyes.

You see, I'd forgotten (for the moment) what matters most at all times, people and how we treat them, for we are them! Taking the time to notice someone else, not for the purpose of flirtation or extortion, but rather, to be their connection from darkness to light again, to give someone that greatest gift of all, namely, hope! And to show others that they're loved and not alone in this world. It's better to give than to receive! Folks, that's not merely some clich that someone came up with; it's THE TRUTH. And no one knows that better, than those who've made a practice of ""giving to others"" with no thought of anything in return.

Enough said. If you can't understand anything from this review yet, then you're beyond hope: a reprobate, incorrigible, a seared conscience and without any soul. If that describes you, then why continue trying to seek instant gratification here? You've come to the wrong place, my friend. Go back to your dark alleys and ways. But but but, if you've had a change of mind and heart, then don't waste anymore time reading and wondering.

But the movie today! And watch it. Think about it. It will haunt your thoughts and visit you in your dreams. Why? Because of this one nagging question: ""Why haven't I given to others?"" This movie is not just another flick. It's life changing, and you will watch it over and over and over again. It will water the parched land of your famished soul!",1399248000,9,2412,4.735714285714286

Despite the flaws this film gives a great story of how the media creates political frontmen and movements.  And how the media dismantles them.  This is a good story to watch to see how Capra performs another dimension of his commentary of corrupt politics in yet another film.

As far as complaints about the film quality, we're lucky to have it as good as it is.

I watch a fair number of videos and movies on my home setup and am used to HD, multi-channel sound that rivals the best BluRay. I'm no expert, but stuff consistently looks and sounds great. I typically have download speed greater than 20 Mbps.

Which brings me to the actual playback of this movie. It is jumpy throughout, most notable when there is motion, either with action or camera panning. Kind of like ""video stuttering"". I sometimes see the same thing on video on demand from my cable provider and it seems to be specific to certain videos. Anyway, I don't know if it is how it got encoded or what.

Same lying thieves and crooks as always in our corrupt government, where as it used to be, let's say 10% crooks and today it's 95% crooks or more!
I defy anyone.....ANYONE...to tell me the last thing this government has done for the good of the working, regular class citizens. You can't do it, and still we do nothing to take this criminal organization of special interests groups that protect the rich and give it back to the people

734862,5,6303935443,"11-15-2013  I'm notsure where the exact identical dvd box in these pages, but this one will do.  Anyhow, 1941 was a pretty good yer for Hollywood classics ans it onlygotbetter as the years passed.  The ""Golden Age, "" as I call it , ran from about 1935 thru to 1955.  These years saw the careers of Bogart, Cagney, Orson Welles, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, Edward G Robinson and so many others, especially supporting actors like James Gleason, Alan Hale, Edward  Arnold,  Tim Holt,  Joseph Cotton and an even larger cluster than the front names of the leading ""Stars.""  We had directors like John Huston, Orson Welles and, of course, our man here Frank Capra.  ""Meet John Doe "" ws made early in 1941, and Capra finished it in  1946, shortly after the War was over, with ""It's a Wonderful Life..""  After having been subjected to a sneak attack by the temporarily superior Japanese military forces, we met the challenges,  rolled up our sleeves and posted  a  great  victory in 1942 at Midway.  When the tide urns against John Doe, in the movie,he doesn't give up, either.  Somehow, good triumphs  In between ""Doe"" and ""Wonderful Life,"" we got Citizen, Kane,""  "" Jekyll and Hyde"",  ""How Green was my Valley,""  ""The Maltese Falcon,""  "" Sgt. York""  and the scariest film of my boyhood, 'The Wolf Man.""  But, instead of a man-wolf killing people ,we got a good, descent man tortured by the horrifying curse of his living nightmare, not unlike the grueling hell on earth of Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa and,worse of all,  the reign of death from the sky; IGNOMINIOUS UNIMAGINABLE  MUSHROOM-SHAPED.  We all, were suddenly different, very different.  But, in 1946's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Capra convinced us we hadn't really changed at all, but life had simply thrown us a curve, a terrible, destructive curve. George and Mary Bailey lived happily eve rafter, as we did , once we defeated the black soul of Oriental militarism and the unparalleled vehement hatred of National Socialism, the Nazis.  Capra made war films for the military,yes, but ""Doe"" and Wonderful Life,"" were ALSO war films, the best face of war films,if  a good face is to be found.  It is there, under neath the story.
  An Eastern newspaper is bought by an abtitious millionaire,  with designs on the governor's  mansion, and he tries to use the Paper to manipulate the voters  into backing D.B. Norton,  (Edward Arnold.)  Barbara Standwyck is a bright, pretty and very Spunky reporter who looses her job but fighs back.  The NEW Newspaper is about fireworks, and that is exactly what she gives them.  She cleverly invents a 'John Doe""  who out  of principal, will commit suicide on Christmas Eve,  dueto  the selfish, cold and corrupt society.  A human John Doe is needed, and a hansome drifter, Gary Cooper, one of my 4 or 5 all-time favorites ,takes the job.  She writes a daily column  from Doe , and the whle nation is enthralled, and, of course,  Anne and  John have fallen in love with each other.
  Norton's plot,of course, is a secret and it looks like it is going to work until Doe begins to wonder, and  with the new editor's intoxicated confession  our hero is sure ,he's being used more than anyone in the country.  He tries to fess up at a dramatic nighttime  baseball stadium in the pouring rain.  His efforts to speak are stifled and the crowd angrily rejects him and his message.  Totally rejected and dejected, he disappears.  Anne looks desparately for him, only to find him really on the  roof  of City Hall, from where he has pledged he will jump to his death.  Mr. Norton, his goons and Standwyck all meet John at the same time.  This scene was filmed in a huge walk-in freezer, as all are told by  a totally honest Doe he really DOES intend to jump.  He is physically restrained  and Standwyck confesses her  great love for the real John Doe, a man named John Willoughby, a washed up minor league baseball pitcher, with a bad arm in need fs reparative surgery.  Standwyck and Cooper leave the roof arm in arm and he editor, the wise-cracking James Gleason says to his former boss, the still unmoved and ruthless Norton,  ""There you are, try licking that, Mr Norton-------THE PEOPLE!!""  As the midnight Christmas church bells ring out all over the city,an unseen choir and orchestra gently intones Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" from his 9th Symphony. ""Meet John Doe"" is  GREAT film, one the whole family can treasure.  Entertaining, funny, moving and so idealistic it is often cited a an example of ""Capra-corn.""  I could not agree more,  one of my personal TopTen all-Time movies, we watch it once or twice a year.  A classic of all classics.  everyone should own a copy of it, no doubt.  If I could, I'd give it 7 to10 Stars, but Amazon only permits 5.  Extremely  and  highly recommended watch it on Christmas Eve with lots of popcorn , pop  and someone you love.

Some things have changed but there is still corruption in public government and the average Joe or Mary sometimes get stepped on. This is one of Frank Capra's best films along with ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This movie's theme is basic and true- help thy neighbor and get to know each other- ""United we stand, divided we fall"". It also depicts how the media tends to build up heroes and how it destroys those it has built up. It shows how media feeds on the latest news till we're saturated with it and then how it turns its back on it. Edward Norton embodies perfectly the corrupt and deceitful politician. He tries to take advantage of something good and tries to use it for his own benefit or else destroy it because it goes against his interests.

Anyway This team has done at least two films together that I know of and both are great examples of Hollywood in the ""Golden Age"". The film is based during the time of the great depression and with Stanwyck on the verge of losing her job as a reporter throws one last punch at her boss that turns into a one of the best of the era. When compared to You Can't take it With You this is easily one step better, if compared to Sullivan's Travels I think your on the right Path as far as similar quality in chemistry on the screen and at the very basic story line. I have this film in my top 20  (towards the top) Classic Depression Era comedy's.

Personally I do not have that much of an issue with the DVD quality, and feel we're lucky to have as many of these films available to use.

Over all I love the story and Walter Brenan as Gary Coopers side kick is also great in this film.

734945,5,6303935443,"Frank Capra strikes again! I don't know how I managed to miss this one all these years. One of my friends suggested I would like this, and I saw it on the strength of that recommendation. I don't remember who it was, but I owe him or her a large thank you.

Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) was about to lose her job at a newspaper that had been sold to a big wig who was not interested in anything but circulation. In fact, she had been fired, but the editor had the gall to insist she finish her column for the day before she left. He said he needed pizzaz, something that would sell newspapers just because it was sensational. So as her last column, she wrote a letter she claimed came from an anonymous ""John Doe"" saying that he was so disgusted with how the world was going that he was going to jump off the top floor of the newspaper building on Christmas Eve at midnight.

So to keep the story alive, Mitchell interviews a lot of unemployed men and chooses an injured baseball player (Gary Cooper), names him John Doe, and hires him to be the front for a series of articles she actually writes. His buddy, the Colonel (Walter Brennan) comes along to keep him company, but disapproves heartily. He warns that John will get caught by the ""Helots,"" the materialists. They'll make him greedy and suck him into the system instead of sleeping under a bridge and riding the boxcars. So the Colonel becomes John's conscience, in effect, but it only works so well.

Next thing you know there are John Doe Clubs popping up all over the country, basically neighborhood groups who look out for each other and try to improve their neighborhood. They are all John Doe people, and won't allow any politicians or other big shots to join.

D B Norton (Edward Arnold) is the rich man who apparently owns the paper now, and who has big ambitions, puts money into helping organize them all over the country. He puts even more into creating a John Doe Convention, where he expects to have Doe form this into a political party and name him (Norton) as their candidate. This is totally a surprise to John Doe, and only partly so to Ann.

No, I'm not going to give away the ending. It's a beautiful movie, as good as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but not in the public domain so you haven't seen it on TV every Christmas. But like that other Capra film, it comes to a conclusion on Christmas.",1336867200,,2369,4.411899313501144

A filthy rich newspaper owner named D. B. Norton uses an innocent dupe to promote ""John Doe Clubs"", then builds on the popularity of the innocent to sponsor these clubs all over the nation.  The secret purpose is to push Mr. Norton's dangerous political agendas at the right moment, when the clubs could be a potent weapon in the next election.  Could that happen here in America?  You betcha!

Substitute the Tea Party Clubs for the John Doe Clubs and substitute the billionaire Koch brothers for D. B. Norton.  It is happening today.

Just don't expect this movie on your TV channel because it might alert Americans to the way innocent, hard pressed Americans are being secretly manipulated by the rich.  After all, there is a lot of money pouring into these Tea Party Meetings by the billionaires.  They are not doing this for philanthropic reasons, but to make sure their conservative agenda is disguised through the voice of the common man.

With writer Robert Riskin he fashioned an everyman story that is one part Messianic and one part populist. John Doe, protesting the condition of the world in general (remember this is nineteen forty-one and the Fascists in Europe have begun World War II) and that of America specifically, says that he is going to throw himself off the tallest building in the city(unnamed)at mid-night, Christmas morning. That John Doe is a fictional character made up by a hustling newspaper gal, Barbara Stanwyck, out to keep her job, is the plot point this story twists on. Gary Cooper is chosen to embody John Doe in the flesh. Some of the situations may seem silly by today's standards but there is nothing wrong with the story nor the Christian sensibility that Capra (Catholic)and Riskin weave into the narrative, nor the warning against tyranny and fascism that seems more and more relevant today. If the spontaneous 'John Doe' clubs that spring up do not put you in mind of a more faith-based type of Tea Party, then you are just a blinded liberal and humorless as well. This is a well crafted tale of redemption and love and the meaning of Sacrifice, yes, in the Divine sense.

735031,5,6303935443,"The Media And I Are Friends: A Look At The Film John Doe
  By Hunter Kilburne

John Doe is a 1942 film, directed by Frank Capra and staring Gary Cooper. It is an examination of the relationship between media and the government. I think it is interesting World War II was going on at the time. The very time Hollywood was examining the effect of lies reported by media (including Hollywood), affects the reality of thousands, even millions of people the same thing was happening in reality. There are many complexities regarding this Ouroboros, but I think a quote from literary maestro, and countercultural maven Alan Moore will suffice ""Politicians use the truth to tell lies, Artists use lies to tell the truth.""

John Doe, like any work of art concerning the government, can be stretched like taffy to fit any agenda. For instance, I am told by many reviews, teachers, websites that 1984 is about Fascism, Communism, Feudalism, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, The Future, The New World Order, The Illuminati, The Freemasons, etc. You know what I mean, Orwell would roll around in his grave every time somebody gives me the real dish on what the dystopia was or is. Anyway, John Doe is an examination of how people are affected by the media, and how different agendas snake their way in.

I think John Doe sets up a pretty simple, yet realistic (albeit the ending) view of how the cycle works. The media and business are twisted together like barbwire. I don't think people realize that the news IS a business. All corporations survive by serving their own interests, so why would the media be any different? Why would they tell you the truth, how would that serve them? The answer is that it doesn't and they don't. So they use words like ""Objectivity"" (presenting everything as separate events so they cannot be linked, even science is connected with a theory so why history be any different?) and ""Moral Majority"" (because everyone has the same morality) ""Political Correctness"" (censorship is okay, you wouldn't anyone to get offended right?). They use these phrases to prove they are only working for your own good, that they represent the truth. As Goethe said, ""None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.""

As with John Doe, people working against the media or its allies are always smeared with subtle messages. You will notice that figures they want to show as good they will always show with light coloring, the person smiling, surrounded by children, and the elderly and are given them nicknames. examples include  FDR, JFK, RFK, MLK. People they want to vilify are presented with dark lighting (usually making their eyes and hair look dark), they zoom in on the eyes, and use their full name. Examples include James Earl Ray, Mark David Chapman, Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald, etc. It is almost comical; Hitler is basically the Devil for the 21st century. Want to make something look evil, say Hitler or the Nazis did it. So people are brainwashed, and think things like eugenics automatically mean genocide. Obviously, I'm not standing up for Hitler, but nothing is black and white. You can't let someone else decide who is evil and good for you.

Other forms of underground media are also vilified. They will associate the devils with whatever is they don't want you to look at. You even see it in modern news -- after Wikileaks made a rather large release of information, Julian Assange was set up as treasonous (even though the majority of the information released was on private companies, and Assange isn't even American), and a rapist. Modern mass murderer Jared Loughner was set up as a believer in UFOs and was anti-government. I guess both ideas are crazy then and we should just forget them.

In the film John Doe, John Willoughby decides not to take them money and not serve D.B. Norton's wishes.  I think Capra did this more to make a happy ending (it was wartime.  Nobody wanted to see anything grim), than another equally possible reason, that he was told to do so by his media buddies. Sure, you think that wouldn't make much of a difference, but really look at it. It makes the media look impotent, like one of Shakespeare's fools. If they look stupid and foolish, they aren't a threat. You don't really watch TV -- TV happens to you, the fantasies and truth of somebody else projected onto your subconscious with flashing colors and buzzing sounds. You are the willing submissive victim to people who really don't have your best interest at heart.  Ironic, that John Doe could be a part of the very conspiracy the film itself is about.",1295568000,,4605,4.771356783919598
735032,5,6303935443,"Meet John Doe is my favorite Frank Capra movie, and it is exciting to see, after all this time, a DVD version come out with some special features.  There are some nice documentaries about Frank Capra, Gary Cooper, and Barbara Stanwyck, an interesting commentary by a British film historian that includes some recordings by Frank Capra about different subjects, and 2 radio adaptations of Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck movies.  It's great to see better picture quality in this version of the DVD and that someone did so much research for the audiocommentary.  The reason, by the way, that I like this even more than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or It's a Wonderful Life, is because the stakes are higher--you're dealing with the entire country being taken over, not local or state politics.  The Christian symbols in the climactic end are also very interesting, with references to 30 pieces of silver, Pontius Pilate, crucifying, and Jesus liberating the John Does for all time to come.  You can also see some Catholic imagery resembling the Stabat Mater (Jesus' mother weeping near the cross) when Stanwyck's character leans in anguish against her mother, with a spiritual lighting.  It's a really powerful movie all around, even if the ending is far-fetched.  I also really love Capra's uses of silence, close-ups, lighting, and humor.  Little details, such as one of the D. B. Norton troopers popping a balloon in their raid on the John Doe convention, make the viewer as angry as their disruption of the convention-gatherers' prayer.  Besides all that, the cast is well-chosen, and you can see the original Winnie the Pooh, Sterling Holloway, serving at the restaurant.  The diatribe Gary Cooper gives Norton and his cronies is the most prolonged expression of emotion that you ever see in Gary Cooper, too.

First, I'll discuss the film itself.  I love Frank Capra movies.  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life</a>"" is my all-time favorite film.  ""Meet John Doe"" is another Capra masterpiece.  Gary Cooper is wonderful as ""Long John"" Willoughby, hired to act the part of John Doe, yet coming to believe in the movement he created.  Edward Arnold as D.B. Norton continues his string of memorable Capra villains.  The film is not neccessarily as uplifting as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but it does have its moments.  When the deception is revealed, his loyal followers turn on him.  Things turn bleak for our hero and he, like George Bailey years later, finds himself contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve.

I have seen 3 or 4 different prints of this film over the last couple of years, via borrowed DVDs, download and on TV.  This is, hands-down, the best looking print I've seen (I have not seen the Madacy version mentioned in other reviews).  It's not quite on par with Paramount's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" restoration, but it is very good.  The extras are a nice bonus.  Ken Barnes' commentary is more detailed than several of the Frank Capra Jr. commentaries found on the Columbia Capra discs.  The featurettes do not focus specifically on ""Meet John Doe,"" but give nice overviews of the careers of Capra, Cooper, and Stanwyck.  Also one of the few DVDs of this film to included subtitles, and you get english, german, french and spanish.  I am also an old time radio fan, so I enjoyed the Lux Radio Theater presentations as well.

Maybe VCI, or someone, will improve on this release someday.  As of right now (Dec 2010), I would say this is the best version of ""Meet John Doe"" you will find.  It's more expensive that some versions, but for what you get I'd say it's worth the few extra bucks.",1291852800,38,2229,5.55786350148368
735107,3,6303935443,"VCI is a lot like Microsoft in that they keep releasing stuff, half finished (ever wonder why when your computer messes something up, you get a prompt asking if you'd like to report the problem to Microsoft, well that's because you're essentially ""Beta Testing"" for them, and by answering ""YES"" to the prompt, you're helping them fix the bugs in the program that should have been ironed out before it was installed in your computer).

This newest version of, Meet John Doe, plays out more like a restoration in progress than an actual finished product.

The most annoying thing is the missing frames, I've only watched about 25 minutes of the movie so far, and in that time there were at least 5 spots where frames (and we're talking more than on frame) were missing (one really bad one during a talking scene, were the audio is fine, but everything shifts causing the actions and sound to un-sync for a moment).

Next there's the varying degree of light and dark in each scene as well as softness (blur is more like it).

Then sometimes the scene has decent black tones, then the next minute the blacks are more an off dark green tone, then a blueish hue, and so one (and remember, like I mentioned before, this happens all within the first 25 minutes of the movie, I actually turned it off as the missing frames where driving me nuts, I mean my cheapie Madacy copy of this film has less missing frames then this one does as well as no black level issues, the only drawback is that the Madacy version is a little overly light).

I did watch some of the extras which although interesting, are pretty slight (the 3 ""Meet"" featurettes are about 16 minutes long each and don't have much on, Meet John Doe).

So, like with VCI's many versions of, A Christmas Carol, I'm sure that this is just the beginning of the VCI road for, Meet John Doe, so let's hope that they eventually get it right (because with at least 3 different versions of, A Christmas Carol, VCI still hasn't gotten it right).",1291766400,13,1988,4.508333333333334

735112,5,6303935443,"""I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life."" -- Long John Willoughby

This Frank Capra film, more so than his others, was shaded more towards drama than humor. Not without humor, or charm, as evidenced in many scenes between Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper, the tone of the Robert Riskin screenplay, based on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell, has more serious implications than Capra's other films. For that reason, and perhaps because surviving prints of this film are not as good as the others, ""Meet John Doe"" sometimes gets unfairly dismissed when films of this extraordinary director are discussed. I highly recommend this film, not this much too expensive print. This was the meat in what many call Capracorn.

Barbara Stanwyck is Ann Mitchell, a reporter soon to be unemployed when her paper is gobbled up by D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold). Desparate to keep the thirty dollar a week salary that keeps her two young sisters and her mom (Spring Byington) afloat, she begs editor Henry Connell (James Gleason) for her job back, but her plea falls on deaf ears. She decides to go out in a blaze, writing a column in which she purports to have received a letter from one John Doe, who, because of the injustice in the world, the state of civilization, and the downtrodden, plans to kill himself at Christmas.

A groundswell of support for Doe gets Ann her job back, but now she and boss Connell must find a 'real' John Doe or their heads will roll. In walks Long John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), a starving baseball player with a bad wing. He and his pal, Colonel (Walter Brennan), are just hungry enough to play along. Colonel has reservations from the get-go, however, afraid that Long Johm will become a helot--a guy with a bank account. Long John just wants to earn enough to get the arm he injured pitching a 19 inning game fixed by Bonesetter Brown, but his shy affection for Ann keeps him around long enough to make a radio speech. Written from words in her father's diary, his speach spreads the John Doe movement all across the country. But Colonel sees the train wreck coming, and takes off.

Clubs start up everywhere, only the 'John Does' allowed to join. People start treating their neighbors with kindness, showing the spirit of Christmas on a day-to-day basis. D.B. Norton, however, has political aspirations, and sees a way to twist the movement to fit his ambitions. It is Henry Connell who clues in Long John on what is about to happen, letting the air out of his balloon and shattering his smitten image of Ann, with her chestnut hair and great legs. What follows, as the country discovers John Doe was a fake, will lead Long John to a rooftop overlooking the city on a snowy Christmas night.

Stanwyck is wonderful here, as Ann slowly comes to realize she has found a man like her father but may have helped to destroy him. Cooper is memorable as Long John Willoughby, a shy ball player who realizes he has come to stand for more than he ever could have on the pitching mound. Brennan is his usual great character, looking out for Long John as much as he can. Some warm and sentimental moments between Cooper's Long John and Stanwyck's Ann humanize the social drama, and offer great charm. In particular, Cooper's scene with Ann's mom, whose help he needs to ask her daughter to marry him, has a sweetness to it that is long gone from today's films. The baseball scene in a hotel room, when they play pretend ball, is a classic.

This is a wonderful film about the little guy that sometimes gets analyzed too much. Capra was simply reminding people that the first John Doe came a long time ago, and people still weren't listening, often fooled by words, and those who would twist something decent to their own sordid advantage. This is a film that works best if you forget it is a Frank Capra picture, and just enjoy it on its own merits. It can then be placed proudly beside the director's other classics on your movie shelf. A masterpiece, with an unforgettable performance by Coop.",1277337600,3,4041,4.652661064425771

735114,5,6303935443,"A common theme in Frank Capra's movies is that great institutions; great intentions and great words can only live or die through the deeds of great men.  In both this movie, and in the earlier ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", great men are called upon to endure hardship and scorn in order to ensure that great institutions, intentions and words are given life.  In this, Gary Cooper's second film with Capra (the first being Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), he plays Long John Willoughby, a baseball playing vagrant, who is chosen to be a human mouthpiece (John Doe) for a newspaper undertaking a publicity stunt - that is, to show the human face of someone disgruntled with the isolation and greed of society.  The words, for which Willoughby is a mouthpiece, are fed to him by ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) who acquires them from a remarkable series of letters written by her late father.  The irony is that, despite being an itinerant, Willoughby has an extraordinary underlying decency and sense of higher purpose for society.  Willoughby's desire to change society for the better fuses with his oratory skills, and the wordsmithing of Ann Mitchell's father, to create a new being who is much greater than the sum of his parts - an enormous force for good - the being becomes the face of the John Doe Movement.  Recognizing the massive growth and potential power of the John Doe Movement, newspaper publisher D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold) seeks to use the movement to create a third political party to achieve his own ends.  When Willoughby refuses to ""play ball"" the full power of Norton's media empire is unleashed upon him - much as it was with Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Ironically, one of Capra's favorite bad guys (Edward Arnold) plays the media mogul in both movies.

It's difficult to believe that this movie is seven decades old.  John Doe's May 1941 US release actually predates the September 1941 (original Australian) release of Citizen Kane but it covers similar issues - the unfettered power of the media.  What Citizen Kane doesn't cover is the need for great men to endure hardship and scorn to challenge unfettered and unjust power.  And, who better to play the humble and seemingly insignificant man who is called upon to achieve greatness than Gary Cooper who gives an exceptional performance as the vagrant baseballer (a good precursor to his subsequent role as Lou Gehrig in ""Pride of the Yankees"" some months later).  Walter Brennan plays his disgruntled vagrant sidekick, known only as ""The Colonel"".  Edward Arnold is superb as always as the quintessential bad guy publishing mogul.  Barbara Stanwyck is great as Ann Mitchell who transforms from being ambitious and unscrupulous to being a force for good.

Meet John Doe was remade in 1992 with Dustin Hoffman as ""Hero"" (aka ""Accidental Hero"") which is also a good movie but with nowhere near the impact of Meet John Doe.  The remake also lacks the depression era feel of Meet John Doe.

Those who watch Meet John Doe would also be interested in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.  Meet John Doe is an excellent movie, decades ahead of its time.  It generally plays second fiddle to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington but its message is just as compelling - and both movies are must-see.",1274659200,2,3315,4.823321554770318

Capra hints at the darker political elements of the times, linking corporate wealth and power with an incipient fascism.  Still, after comedy gives way to serious social content and melodrama, in the end right triumphs over cynical might, and Gary Cooper with Barbara Stanwyck's help, one of her more energetic performances, pulls off one of the more unlikely final scenes in all filmdom. But, and this is a major reservation, the DVD version here is one of the poorest technical productions in all DVD-dom.

The Madacy version is the one with the gold heading that says ""Hollywood Classics"" above a picture-in-picture of Cooper with his hand around Stanwyck's waist. Amazon has the date of release as 1998. The description of the movie found on the back cover is laughably misleading, (someone really put a lot of effort into that mumbo-jumbo, let me tell ya!) but I thought the picture and sound quality were quite decent, as good (or better, i.e. The Devil and Daniel Webster)as many Criterion releases of films from that period.

 I read that this was the first independant film Capra did, and his last social commentary. The film was a decent commercial success but then they put the man out of business with extreme taxation. One could almost envision a scenario not unlike what the Walter Brennan character & co. pulled on the John Doe movement in the film being premeditated against Capra given his attempt to break from the almighty studios and do his own thing free of their restrictions.

Critiquing the film itself:
 Yes, the film IS whimsy, but it's intentionally so. Many films are based on ""what if...?"" scenarios, Meet John Doe is based on the greatest of them all; what if we loved one another and focused on our similarities instead of all the petty differences that keep us apart? What if we no longer allowed our overlords to divide us by using politics to obscure the real issues? What if we simply ignored all the parasites who get fat from sucking our blood? Well? Pie in the sky, no doubt, but, perhaps you've thought such things once or twice yourself. What is underestimated about this film is how it shows many of the pragmatic and/or cynical counter-arguments against such thinking, giving the film a sturdier and more well-rounded base. It is an easy film (much like its creator) to denigrate because it wears its heart on its sleeve, and we pompous intellectuals are taught that to do so is childish and foolish. But am I wrong in thinking that this film shows the only way REAL change (not to be confused with the Obama, or any other political huckster's version)COULD work?

 I recommend this movie (along with Capra's ""You Can't Take It With You"" to anyone who senses that there is something wrong with our social system but has a hard time not letting it all get them down. Especially those who believe in the message of Christ (not to be confused with religion).

 On a related matter, I think everyone interested in the Tea Party movement or the motivations of such people as Glen Beck in steering such a movement, would do well to dig up this old treasure and watch it with friends or family.",1261612800,3,2687,4.677966101694915

Can a newspaper create news to build circulation? Will people make a self-serving claim? They pick one who can pitch their line. The newspaper will build up a story on ""John Doe"". Is there a danger in owning things? The newspaper creates protest stories on various themes. It shows how a wealthy publisher can sway public opinion by controlling the news. [Is this old news?] The film tells about the effects of the Great Depression in a subtle way.

Can a writer find inspiration from an old diary? Will a competing newspaper try to expose this publicity stunt? What will John Doe say on live radio? A heckler is ejected. ""We're the people."" John Doe can't escape his fame. [The scenes are funny.] People form fan clubs all over the country. Should people show more concern to their neighbors? [The attitudes of that era are shown.] Will the ""John Doe Clubs"" become a big business? Can a multi-millionaire use them for political purposes? Could a new third party represent 90% of the voters? [No, but 55% is enough to win.] This film shows how candidates are manipulated to advance the interests of the super-rich. ""It can't happen here?"" Those who object will be dealt with harshly.

John Doe escapes to address the convention, but D. B. Norton's troopers and newspapers attempt to squash the movement. The crowd rejects their hero (the fickleness of public opinion). What the media prints as Truth is accepted by most people. A group travel up to the 14th floor to watch. A man drops a letter into a mail slot, then goes to the 14th floor. There is a confrontation.

I'm mostly a sucker for Capra's corn but I admit that I had a hard time during some of the more rousing messages.  I tended to roll my eyes like the great Walter Brennan character, the bum, who just wants John to hit the road with him again and avoid all of this hullabaloo.  What kept me interested was Gary Cooper.  He is one of the best looking actors of all time, in my opinion, and his charm matches his good looks.  He is very funny in the early parts, too.  He is perfectly cast as a John Doe everyman type who appeals to the common man.  I think if it had featured a less attractive actor I might have bailed out early on.

I love Barbara Stanwyk in her bad girl noir films.  In this she is adequate but no match for Cooper.  The rest of the cast is very good.  Spring Byington brings her special sweetness to the role of Stanwyck's mother. Edward Arnold is always monumental.

The story is hard for us to relate to, realistically, but the sentiments are good and I found the ending surprisingly moving.
I think a lot of its value lies in the picture of how life was in those days.  There's a lot of talk about the common man but yet in all of the shots of the masses, we don't see any Blacks or Latinos.  When people talk about making friends with their neighbors, their neighbors are other White folks like they are.  That's how it was in those days but it does sort of make the  grandeur of the message a little.....dated.",1249171200,,1709,4.145896656534954

John Doe's letter causes quite a stir, and Ann's newspaper sees it as an opportunity to sell papers. They hire her back to personally oversee the choosing of a John Doe and to build up as much publicity for the paper as possible. She picks John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), a mild mannered bum whose original ambition was to be a baseball player. He is just in it for the money, until John Doe's political speeches begin inspiring the nation. John Doe clubs pop up all over the place and begin to really make some positive changes in the world. However, the image is controlled by the money hungry newspaper who refuses to let the campaign take its course and instead attempt to use it for their own corrupt ambitions.

Meet John Doe is a surprisingly relevant story, despite its seemingly saccharine message. However, this is no happy-go-lucky Capra movie. It is much darker with a pessimistic side. Because of this, it seems more realistic. Just as the John Doe clubs are inspiring, the corruption of the paper is disheartening. It is easy to dismiss this theory for change in todays society when it seems that the poor have no say whatsoever. But if we all banded together like the John Doe clubs do, change might be more accessible. It has been shown in Labor Party victories overseas. Why not in America?

Okay, the movie writes itself into a corner, for what else is going to happen except that if Gary Cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it's established with the viewers.

735317,5,6303935443,"""I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life.""
Long John Willoughby

This Frank Capra film, unlike others he had made, leaned more towards drama than humor. Though there is humor, and many charming moments involving Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, the tone of the Robert Riskin screenplay, based on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell, has more serious implications than Capra's other films. For that reason, and perhaps because the prints of this film are not as good as the others, ""Meet John Doe"" sometimes gets unfairly dismissed when Capra's films are discussed. This was the meat in what many call ""Capracorn.""

Barbara Stanwyck is Ann Mitchell, a reporter soon to be unemployed when her paper is gobbled up by D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold). Desparate to keep the thirty dollar a week salary that keeps her two young sisters and her mom (Spring Byington) afloat, she begs editor Henry Connell (James Gleason) for her job back, but her plea falls on deaf ears. She exits with a column that's a real doozy, pretending she has received a letter from a ""John Doe"" who, because of the injustice in the world, the state of civilization, and the downtrodden, plans to kill himself at Christmas.

A groundswell of support for John Doe gets Ann her job back, but now she and boss Connell must find a ""John Doe."" In walks Long John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), a hungry baseball player with a bad wing. He and his pal, Colonel (Walter Brennan), are just hungry enough to play along. Colonel has reservations from the get-go, however, afraid that Long Johm will become a helot--a guy with a bank account.

Long John just wants to earn enough to get the arm he injured pitching a 19 inning game fixed by Bonesetter Brown, but his shy affection for Ann keeps him around long enough to make a radio speech, written from words in her father's diary. His speach spreads the John Doe movement all across the country. It is the crusty Colonel who sees the train wreck coming, however, and takes off.

Clubs start up everywhere, only the ""little"" people allowed to join. People start treating their neighbors with kindness, showing the spirit of Christmas on a day-to-day basis. D.B. Norton, however, has political aspirations, and sees a way to twist the movement to fit his ambitions. It is Henry Connell who clues in Long John on what is about to happen, letting the air out of his balloon and shattering his smitten image of Ann, with her chestnut hair and great legs. What follows, as the country discovers John Doe was a fake, will lead Long John to a rooftop overlooking the city on a snowy Christmas night.

Stanwyck is wonderful here, as Ann slowly comes to realize she has found a man like her father but may have helped to destroy him. Cooper is memorable as Long John Willoughby, a shy ball player who realizes he has come to stand for more than he ever could have on the pitching mound. Brennan is his usual great character, looking out for Long John as much as he can.

There are some warm and sentimental moments between Cooper's Long John and Stanwyck's Ann mixed in with the social drama, and some charm as well. Cooper's scene with Ann's mom, whose help he needs to ask her daughter to marry him, has a sweetness to it that is long gone from today's films. And the baseball scene in a hotel room, when they play pretend ball, is a classic.

This is a wonderful film about the little guy that sometimes gets analyzed too much. All Capra was trying to do, was remind people that the first John Doe came a long time ago, and people still weren't listening. This is a film that works best if you forget it is a Frank Capra picture, and just enjoy it on its own merits. It can then be placed proudly beside the director's other classics on your movie shelf.",1127001600,25,3787,4.6

735358,5,6303935443,"""Meet John Doe"" is clearly the most political of director Frank Capra's famous ""Capracorn"" films, even more than ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" or ""State of the Union."" Newspaper columnist Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck in a rare ""good girl role"") is fired and prints a phony letter in her final column about a man who is going to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to protest the misery and corruption afflicting the county. The letter is signed ""John Doe."" The letter causes a sensation and Ann gets her job back, but it becomes necessary for her to produce a real ""John Doe"" to the skeptics. She basically holds auditions for the role and settles on Long John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), a starving bush league pitcher whose arm has gone bad.

Ann continues to write article in the name of John Doe, calling on everyone to love their neighbor and the like. This only increases the fan mail and in the best scene of the film she writes ""John Doe"" a speech to read on the radio, inspired by the words of her father. As ""John"" himself gets caught up in the speech and its response, Ann is totally enraptured by the moment. This all might be a giant con game, but Ann is now a true believer in the fiction she has created. But at that point the powerful publishing magnate, D. B. Norton (Edward Arnold), throws his support behind the John Doe clubs because he wants them to hold a convention where ""John"" will nominate him as a third party candidate for the presidency. Obviously Norton is some sort of American fascist, and when ""John"" refuses to play along, Norton publicly exposes him to the mob in a devastating fashion. All that is left to ""John"" is to fulfill the original promise of the first letter and commit suicide on Christmas Eve.

Cooper and Capra had enjoyed success before with ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" but this is the much better film by far. Cooper's performance in this 1940 film is certainly Oscar worthy, but his next film was ""Sergeant York"" and that was the film that won the actor his first Academy Award. Stanwyck's performance is just as good, proving she could do more than film noir bad girls. Like most of Capra's great works, including ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" the mythic structure is clearly that of the crucifixion and resurrection (think about it). The symbolic ""death"" of John Doe is arguably the most painful in any of Capra's films and the character's ""resurrection"" is definitely the most believable. Capra originally had a darker ending than what was provided, but we all know that really would have gone against his grain. Again, the supporting cast for Capra's film is absolutely stellar, with Edward Arnold, Walter Brennan, Spring Byington, Gene Lockhart, Sterling Holloway, and especially James Gleason as Ann's newspaper editor, all getting the most out of Robert Riskin's screenplay. ""Meet John Doe"" is definitely a classic Frank Capra film.",1123372800,4,2880,4.758

This all might be a giant con game, but Ann is now a true believer in the fiction she has created. But at that point the powerful publishing magnate, D. B. Norton (Edward Arnold), throws his support behind the John Doe clubs because he wants them to hold a convention where ""John"" will nominate him as a third party candidate for the presidency. Obviously Norton is some sort of American fascist, and when ""John"" refuses to play along, Norton publicly exposes him to the mob in a devastating fashion. All that is left to ""John"" is to fulfill the original promise of the first letter and commit suicide on Christmas Eve.

Cooper and Capra had enjoyed success before with ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" but this is the much better film by far. Cooper's performance in this 1940 film is certainly Oscar worthy, but his next film was ""Sergeant York"" and that was the film that won the actor his first Academy Award. Stanwyck's performance is just as good, proving she could do more than film noir bad girls. Like most of Capra's great works, including ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" the mythic structure is clearly that of the crucifixion and resurrection (think about it). The symbolic ""death"" of John Doe is arguably the most painful in any of Capra's films and the character's ""resurrection"" is definitely the most believable. Capra originally had a darker ending than what was provided, but we all know that really would have gone against his grain. Again, the supporting cast for Capra's film is absolutely stellar, with Edward Arnold, Walter Brennan, Spring Byington, Gene Lockhart, Sterling Holloway, and especially James Gleason as Ann's newspaper editor, all getting the most out of Robert Riskin's screenplay. ""Meet John Doe"" is definitely a classic Frank Capra film.",1114819200,,2867,4.766599597585513
735361,4,6303935443,"""Meet John Doe"" is an engaging populist drama with some elements of screwball comedy, but it lacks the resonance of director Frank Capra's ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"".  Now Capra is not the most subtle of directors but he is really wearing his sentiments on his sleeve here.  Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck are fine here but not outstanding.  Walter Brennan is, well, Walter Brennan.  The presence of Edward Arnold as the newspaper magnate with political ambitions telegraphs the ominous direction the film's story is going to go.  I kept thinking that what if an actor with a little more subtlety who doesn't wear the black hat so prominently was cast instead, like say, Claude Rains.  I also thought to myself while watching this how the Coen brothers were influenced to some degree by Capra in films like ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".  This is a good film but not one of Capra's best.",1103673600,5,917,4.765822784810126
735362,5,6303935443,"I give this movie 5 stars.  Outstanding story, outstanding performances from the entire cast, an unforgettable climax..everything working together as only Capra could do it!!  I enjoy watching this movie at Christmas time.  Cooper and Stanwyck were teamed twice in 1941...for this..(and for Ball of Fire).  They have great on screen chemistry and both turn in bravura performances....especially Stanwyck.....who should have won the Oscar in 1941 for her work in three of her greatest performances (Lady Eve, Ball of Fire and Meet John Doe).

The only complaint I have is all of the transfers for this superb film have always been poor.  When it was released on VHS every copy of the film was cut from a poor negative.  Why is this?  When are we going to get a good, clear, remastered cut of this fine film???

Look for this in the bargain bins at your video store or order it from here....it doesn't matter.  The film is great but the DVD quality is very poor.  It will always be like this until someone decides to restore it and release it in high quality.

Whenever you see a DVD that is sealed at a bargain price...beware.....you are most likely getting a poor quality transfer.........",1090886400,18,1189,4.7745098039215685

The end is the best, as in all of Capra's films, depicting the endearing belief in the goodness of the common man. He could not have ended this movie any other way, it was a perfect end to a perfect movie. Gary Cooper is superb in this role, a man pretending to be something he is not, then beginning to believe he is the part he is playing. You can't help but feel the same way. You can't help but loathe the sinister character, and you hope the girl will come to her senses, and get the guy, as well.

735366,4,6303935443,"This film appeared at a time when the United States continued to emerge from the Great Depression amidst fears of what soon became World War Two. Many people distrusted government and capitalism; some felt betrayed by them. Directed by Frank Capra, this film addresses the concerns of the so-called ""common"" man, a stereotype whom we now call ""John Doe."" How ironic that the film's hero and heroine, advocates of truth and justice, are frauds. After being fired by her newspaper during an extensive lay-off, Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) includes in her final column a letter allegedly sent to by ""John Doe"" who is so upset about society's mistreatment of ""the little people"" that, in protest, he plans to jump from the top floor of city hall on Christmas Eve. The bogus letter creates so much interest that Mitchell is kept on to continue writing her column which now focuses entirely on John Doe. Fearful that the hoax will be revealed, the newspaper auditions several men and finally hires ""Long John"" Willoughby (Gary Cooper) to claim he is John Doe. Willoughby is a former baseball player with a dead arm who had been riding the rails with The Colonel (Walter Brennan). Once hired, Willoughby soon becomes totally caught up in the role he plays. His eloquence (expressing what Mitchell has given him to say) and apparent sincerity inspire what becomes the National John Doe Movement, with local chapters throughout the United States. What Willoughby doesn't know and Mitchell does not fully realize is that D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold), publisher of the newspaper, is funding the Movement (e.g. buying radio time for John Doe to promote his ""Golden Rule"" philosophy) to build a wide and deep base of popular support for his own (Norton's) Presidential campaign. Norton views with contempt precisely the same people who are attracted to John Doe, unknowingly serving as the political equivalent of a Trojan horse.
Despite all the positive values which Capra so passionately affirms, this is a dark film. Its celebration of The Golden Rule is muted by the fact that, although the principles and objectives of the Movement are admirable, John Doe is a fraud. Also, although Mitchell and others reaffirm their faith in John Doe during the final scene on Christmas Eve atop city hall, there is no reason to think that the Movement can continue. In an earlier scene, Norton's ""troops"" quickly shut down a Movement rally. I will never forget Doe struggling to be heard, speaking into a microphone after its plug (and his) had been pulled by Norton's quasi fascists. People such as Norton with almost unlimited resources allow such movements only if they pose no threat and/or can be exploited somehow to their own advantage.
Only actors with the skills and temperament of a Cooper and Stanwyck could possibly make the final scene credible, at least temporarily. Of course, we will never know what happened thereafter but Capra has made his point: The world would be a much better place if everyone practiced the Golden Rule. As the example of John Doe suggests, if it is worth dying for, then it is certainly worth living for.",1063929600,24,3125,4.942965779467681

735444,5,6303935443,"The story has been dealt with by the other reviewers, so no need to rehash that. An important message in this film, I think , is the manner in which the media honchos (the ""Healots,"" as Walter Brennan's Colonel poetically calls them) seek to manipulate public opinion for their own personal gain. This is partuclarly evident in the climatic scene in which the fatcats ""expose"" Gary Cooper before Cooper can expose them to the masses. As was the case with ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" this was mighty strong stuff for the 30s and 40s when the masses were taught to trust those in power.
However, my one minor complaint about this film is that Gary Cooper was a tad too wooden for the role. One could easily picture Capra regular Jimmy Stewart with his ""aw shucks"" persona as the baseball player who is bamboozled (at first) into playing ""John Doe.""",1041465600,4,850,4.635761589403973

Always having a touch of idealism, Capra had been strongly affected by the 1930's. The depression was much more than bread lines and executives jumping out of windows. It was a time when people were stressed to the limit and ""wars"" between striking workers and and powerful corporations broke out creating a period of American history that we usually try to avoid mentioning. This film cries out for another way of dealing with such issues. John Doe simply asks for people to try to get along with the other fellow. Gary Cooper is wonderful in the roll of ""John Doe"" Barbara Stanwick, James Gleason, Ed Arnold are all perfectly cast as well. This is on of those great films that every generation needs to see. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD could have been better but isn't so bad either, so I rate this DVD with a blazing five stars. Let me add an important update: Beware!
