This DVD is great for the beginner or expert it's very detailed but poingnant. I look forward to new products and videos released by this company.  Nothing else like it on the market. The first practical dog training tool I've seen in a while.
Good luck training!",1428624000,,431,4.320987654320987
8703246,5,B00TWTUCZ8,Excellent Training DVD! We're currently using it for our 3 month old Chocolate Lab and the results were evident on the first day. I really appreciate the easy-to-follow methods and these guys did a great job explaining why certain techniques and tools are used. Looking forward to learning more with the next one.,1427155200,,313,4.9245283018867925
