8227176,5,B000X813H8,"If you love Gavin and Stacey, you will love Fat Friends. This is a great series that was where Gavin and Stacey was born. All three actors met on this set and Jones and Cordon began their journey to Gavin and Stacey. The series is a bit darker (well, a lot darker) but equally as funny as it follows a group of friends through the weight-loss process in a Weight Watchers-like setting. Each is met with differing results and their outlooks vary, but the character development and interaction is what makes the series. It is really not to be missed.",1395187200,,548,4.49
