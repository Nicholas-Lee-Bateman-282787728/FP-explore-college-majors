8364395,5,B002CS5NX2,A great collection of short cons and bar bets for someone looking to get a FREE beer.  This is not a manual for becomes a grifter like one of the reviewers had hoped.  I would not buy this with that expectation Todd makes a living as an entertainer and someone who helps law enforcement to expose various cons.  THIS IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.  These are performances intended to amuses people and give them a small history lesson.  I liked this so much I bought the book as well.,1481500800,,480,4.409090909090909

8364397,2,B002CS5NX2,"Todd Robbins is a very entertaining man. I would gladly pay to see him perform or to purchase a DVD of his performances. That being said, Modern Con Man Collection was a bit disappointing.  I expected more. There are some cons that would be great to get a free drink. In fact, there are a few I will try on my friends. However I was expected more details and more complicated Cons. The CD on card cons is too simplistic. An amateur like me needs more direction and details. The last DVD on pranks for coworkers is completely useless.  If you are looking for serious pranks or how to get revenge on someone I suggest the Get Even series by George Hayduke from Paladin Press. These are serious and not for the faint of heart. Modern Con Man Collection would be better at $10. For the $20 plus I paid, I don't think I got my money's worth.",1373241600,,836,4.284810126582278
