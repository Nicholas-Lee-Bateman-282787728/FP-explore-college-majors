8602227,3,B00E77ROWE,"Like most PBS specials, one or two cast members from a popular BBC sitcom are brought in to discuss various aspects of a handful of programmes featured on American public television.  Clips are shown of the programmes themselves, of interview with actors and/or directors, sometimes producers, and some terrible jokes are made.

Here we have Moira Brooker and Philip Bretherton discussing the process that takes place whenever the BBC craft a new episode of a programme, such as Are You Being Served?, As Time Goes By, Blackadder, and a few others.  While semi-informative, I get the feeling they were just making another clips and highlights special.  I didn't get much from it.  I actually got a little bored.  I'm sure it was used by at least twenty or so PBS stations around the United States during a fundraising drive, and ""given away"" as a ""gift"" for donations of a hundred dollars or more.

However, I will say this: rather than just talking to the actors, producers, and directors, they also chatted with some of the writers of the various shows as well as costumers, make-up artists, and set designers.  And it was nice to see footage of David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, who are sadly no longer with us.

My recommendation is this: only buy a copy if you're really into PBS specials, or you'd like a brief glimpse into what goes on backstage.",1419465600,,1349,4.730769230769231
