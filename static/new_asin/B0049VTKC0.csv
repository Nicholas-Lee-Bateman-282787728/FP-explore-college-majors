8550809,4,B0049VTKC0,"I'm the Recycling Outreach Program Coordinator for Frederick County, MD. As such, I'm always looking for materials that I can present to students to teach about waste and to engage them in recycling- why it matters, how to do it and how the system works.

This video provides a good introduction to the concept of trash and in particular places emphasis on the problem of too much trash in today's consumption-oriented world. It does NOT go into: how a landfill works or how the recycling process works. It never mentions incineration/waste-to-energy at all.

Basically covers the three R's (reduce reuse recycle), how to do them and why it's important. Fairly entertaining, humorous style which is nice that a serious subject doesn't get too preachy.

The segment includes two hands-on activities- one, which looks at packaging is very good. The other, well, I'm not sure what building a terrarium really has to do with garbage or recycling, except the reuse of a 2-liter bottle. I think Bill could have done better (how about a decomposition experiment?)

It would have been nice for them to cover how things do or don't biodegrade in a landfill, what typically can and can't be recycled and why. Or how recycling gets collected and sorted. Or anything more in depth. But for a short, engaging introduction to the topic, this is OK.",1321920000,5,1334,4.889380530973451
