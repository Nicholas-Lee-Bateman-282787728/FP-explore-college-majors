6929764,5,B00RFG788E,"This is by far one of my new favorite movies. I look forward to purchasing it when it goes on amazon instant video.
This movie is a great love story about finding who you are, by leaving your home.
The movie is based loosely on Rihanna, Beyonce, and a couple other ""mulatto"" stars' lives and their journey to their successful careers. It shows how much of your privacy is lost when you become a celebrity, and the things you sacrifice to become a role model. It is a compelling story, that will make you cry and laugh. I think it would be a mistake not to watch this film because it looks like a chick flick. Because it is not. And if you rent this movie, you will not regret it. Unless you're a judgmental person who doesn't pay attention to movies or understand their underlying meaning.",1423180800,12,789,4.374149659863946

6929769,4,B00RFG788E,"We live in a world where celebrities are at our fingertips at all times.  We can, if we wanted to, know where they ate for lunch, what they had, what they threw away, what books they're reading, what brand of dog food they feed the pooch that sleeps in their purses.  The list goes on and on.  We have people who are paid to exploit all of their secrets, all of their movements.  We don't even care what our own kids eat for lunch, leaving the school cafeteria to give them whatever they deem fit, but if we can find out what flavor fruit smoothie Katy Perry likes to cleanse herself with, then were on it.  We hear celebrities talk and balk about how this pressure and this insistent exploitation of their basic human right for privacy is draining, emotionally, and we even see the aftermath in some celebrities, with rehab trips, psychological breakdowns and even early death.  Its a really serious issue, but one that will never go away because greed runs this country, and a celebrity is always worth something, dead or alive.

Beyond the Lights tries to look at the other side of this obsession, developing a story that centers on a rising star who isn't obsessed with the fame or the money or the fans but simply wants out.  Shes already over it, before it even begun.

Problem is, no one else is.

Beyond the Lights tells the story of young Noni, a talented young woman who is on the verge of a major breakout.  After an introduction scene that sets up the family dynamics (Noni is talented from birth, her mother has nothing and will accept nothing but the best), we are thrust into a world where Noni is being exploited for all of her talents; her voice and her body.  At an awards show she is lead around by her musical collaborator and studio assigned boyfriend, Kid Culprit, while their music video (which degrades her in many ways) plays on large screens for the audience.  The cheers from her peers echo in her head as she wins an award and pretty much cements the sales for her upcoming album.  The sky is the limit for her, but so is all the pressure, and as she escapes to her hotel room, begging not to be disturbed, she attempts to kill herself.  Thankfully, there was a security guard, Kaz, there to save her.

What happens next is director/screenwriter Gina Prince-Bythewoods way of tackling these themes but getting a tad too caught up in the Hollywood tropes to allow herself to really flesh these out solidly.  The main story, of Nonis emotional collapse, is so rich with meaning and poignancy that it didn't need the whole Romeo + Juliett aspect thrown in to complicate matters.  The relationship between Noni and her mother (a brilliant Minnie Driver) and her faux boyfriend and her studio and the battle within herself were more than enough, but the need to make this feel like your average chick flick gave me pause in moments.  It held back the development of some of the key issues because it needed to follow these two individuals, and while Kazs character has his own set of baggage and internalized struggles, hes never as interesting or as pertinent to the real story as Gina wants us to think he is.

But Beyond the Lights does offer us some really well tuned hints at the life a not so luxurious pop-star, and it uses its star (breakout Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in ways that no other film Ive seen this year uses its star.  With subtle looks, facial shifts, body language and tone of voice, Gugu embodies a woman suffocating a world where no one can hear her, no one can see her.  All they see, all they hear, is what she can offer them.  From her mother, who has allowed her determination to make a better life for her and her daughter cloud her better judgment, to the masses of fans who only want a piece of who Noni is, Mbatha-Raw sells every ounce of this lost womans soul.  It is in this soulful and complex performance that Beyond the Lights finds its voice.

Dont let my criticism fool you, for Beyond the Lights is not your average chick flick.  In fact, its not a chick flick at all.  There is real bite and real authenticity found in these bones, I just wish that those bones held a little more meat in some key areas, and that the tendency to fall into clich&eacute;d depictions of hope (like, that ending was just awful) had escaped an otherwise beautiful and enriched look at the tragedy that is fame.",1421020800,36,4343,4.485387547649301
6929770,5,B00RFG788E,"Noni Jean (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)is a rap/hip-hop singer whose early life is semi-biographical. Her career is controlled by her driver mother (Minnie Driver). She clearly makes her money by being a rapper sex object than through her talents. Disillusioned with life, she attempts a take a dive off a balcony only to be rescued by officer Kazam Nicol which fuels a relationship.

Kaz is also being pushed by his father (Danny Glover) into a political career he doesn't really want.

The film is a romance which rejects the sexist rapper world in favor of finding your own voice. A little sappy at times and a bit formulaic. Lifetime fans will eat this up.

6929785,5,B00RFG788E,"I love this movie, the romance & the behind-the-scenes look at what celebrities go through. Clearly, this young woman Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) has been through a lot as has her mother. The movie depicts how there need to be a difference between being a parent and being a manager. Noni loves singing, but she has been put into a box and made to be a sex object, where people focus on her body and not her voice. Her mom was right behind pushing. So she fails to see that her daughter is struggling mentally.
Noni feels invisible because she's not herself, but some character others created. It quite emotional, but then come Kaz (Nate Parker) who sees her. He is the stability that she needs b/c he keeps it real with her. He's her hero, but he has to deal with issues too. He's a cop with a big heart who wants to make the world, well at least LA a better place.
What the viewer sees is two different lifestyles, but one commonality (two people seeking to be free but are held captive by overbearing parents), one is this rich celebrity who is being run over by her mother and record label, and the other this very caring cop who has been molded to become a politician and his father and I guess his political manager run him too. Somehow these two overcome the barriers in their life and find love. That's the beauty of this movie, takes you through the highs and lows. It might be cheesy to some, but I love it. Besides, it's Gugu Mbatha-Raw, I think she's a fantastic actress.",1521936000,,1478,4.378181818181818

It's even fairly family friendly, with language, sex, and violence kept on the low side.

6929832,5,B00RFG788E,Surprisingly good movie with a healing theme. Real love cherishes and believes in the person underneath the glitz and fame. Real love respects and doesn't use another person. Most of all sincere love changes lives but it can't be built upon a lie. The truth is healing and necessary for a solid relationship. Lots of good stuff in the movie. It starts out kind of trashy but the point is to show you how selling sex when you have real talent is just sad. Having to maintain an image that isn't really you makes you want to jump from a balcony even if you win an award for your sexy singing. Fame can cause you to feel used and exploited. You have to show the depravity in the beginning to fully understand the beauty at the end.,1481068800,,728,4.321167883211679

6929949,5,B00RFG788E,"I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out.  It's great! I don't normally go for love stories, but this one is not at all sappy or cheesy. I do love music-related moves, which this is,  and as a hair stylist I was in awe of the hair styles & colors, and fashions. The music 2 as great, the story was well written, the casting was perfect - i don't have anything negative to say about this movie at all, and it's beyond me that it wasn't a runaway hit!!
Another thing- there are morals to this story. It shows that you don't have to sell out if you are good! You don't have to be a ho! And true love is possible where you don't expect it. And even if you think your parent is more concerned with living vicariously through their child, if you look deeper you may see that is due to love. Its a great story in every way.
I've been buying dvds for years and my collection has really overtaken my house & home, and this may be the last movie I ever buy, but it's definitely one worth owning. I will watch it again and show it to others.",1443312000,,1044,4.014423076923077

6929956,5,B00RFG788E,"Someone made a comparison of this film to The Body Guard which was a great film but ultimately an over-simplistic generalization. What is true about both is that there is actual story-telling, multi-dimentional characters (main and supporting) and its very well acted by super-star talents. When I saw that Minnie Driver and Danny Glover were in the film, I suspected there might be some weight to what could appear as a cookie-cutter, pop-inspired film and my expectations were more than met. Without being heavy handed it touched a lot of social themes revelant to our world today and is ultimately inspiring.

6929999,5,B00RFG788E,"I saw this movie for the first time in the movie theater after seeing a preview of it. After seeing it for the first time, I knew I had found a new favorite. I was so excited to purchase this movie through Amazon so that I could watch it on my Fire Stick and on my app. My second time seeing it was just as magical as my first. If you're considering purchasing this movie, I'll tell you my top reasons why you should:
1) The emotional connection is amazing! These characters are so believable! Whoever picked the cast for this movie did a phenomenal job. I felt every emotion the characters portrayed throughout the movie!
2) Okay I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of musicals...However, the music in this movie is so great! (Besides one ""rap"" song towards the beginning). Blackbird, Fly Before You Fall, etc...I found many great songs because of this movie.
3) This movie actually has a really SMOOTH plot!
4) The movie addresses some real life issues, which I loved!
Without giving away too much information, the aforementioned are the reasons I love the movie. My only problem with the movie is that the ending leaves me wanting to see more and know more (sequel perhaps)... But this is definitely a must see!",1438128000,2,1214,4.5479452054794525

Minnie Driver was tremendous in this Movie this is the 2nd Movie I saw the Actress in most recently. I'm a huge fan Return to Zero was excellent. I feel this film showed Driver's true talent in the Music Industry being a Singer, Songwriter herself. The Writer, Director, has an amazing vision for telling her story as she so, honestly, bravely, beautifully, told it. The Actress Gugu was courageous, to take on this role, her journey was freeing to watch. The chemistry the two Actors had was beautiful to see. They fell hard, fast but, fell in love.

6930146,3,B00RFG788E,"Gugu Mbatha-Raw came out of nowhere in ""Belle"" (2013) where she played the bi-racial daughter of an 18th century British aristocrat.  A fine performance in an excellent movie.  Here she does a complete 180, starring as Noni Jean, a Rhianna wannabe complete with a purple weave and sexual persona.  Just getting into the business with her mother Macy (Minnie Driver) guiding her career, she's managed to hook up with a well-established rapper called Kid Culprit (Machine Gun Kelly) on a couple of his records...and in his boudoir.

Macy and the record company are putting Noni through her paces, with exotic photo shoots, countless interviews and other hurried promotions.  None of it, is making Noni very comfortable.  She just wants to sing.  After an unusual night of partying and too much Champaign, Noni decides to take a dive off her hotel's balcony.  She's saved at the last second by an off duty cop stationed at her door.

Kaz Nicol (Nate Parker, ""Non-Stop"") is a cop's son with eyes on politics.  But of course, his eyes shift to Noni and her obvious inner turmoil.  One thing leads to another and the pair fall for each other, much to the consternation of everyone involved.  If this all sounds a lot like ""The Bodyguard"" (1992), well it is.  I guess there's nothing wrong with that.  But don't look for many Whitney Houston-like singing moments.

There are times when Gina Prince-Bythewood's script and direction become just another soap opera.  But then Mbatha-Raw's performance reels us back in.  She's a remarkable actress and her scenes with the ripped Parker suggest a real appreciation for each other.  The film is far from great, but I would give it a mild recommendation on a quiet night in front of a fire.

The movie was shot digitally and the transfer to Blu ray is excellent as we might expect.  It has a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The detail and clarity is exceptional.  There is a scene where Noni decides to lose the purple ""weave"" and for the first time, I saw how those hairpieces are actually attached.  Black levels are very good and the overall color palette is exceptional.  I was very impressed with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio option.  The best examples are with the musical numbers which include a clear, quiet rendition of ""Blackbird"" made famous by Nina Simone, not the one by The Beatles.  Noni sings it as a child in her first completion and later at a small restaurant in Mexico.  When the scenes include full-on rock/rap/R & B settings the subwoofers and surrounds kick into action.  Nicely done sound throughout the film.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include some deleted scenes, alternatives scenes, some interviews, a music video (""Masterpiece""), a tribute to the late Gary Theard, a trailer, commentary track and an optional ""director's cut"" (16 seconds longer).",1430956800,,2869,4.87991718426501

Her vocal skills and moving facial expressions do justice to Nina Simone's ""Blackbird,"" which says a lot, especially alongside her commitment to challenging choreography and a demanding script. I have long admired Minnie Driver, whose keen portrayal of a dedicated stage mom makes for a nuanced, believable character that could have disappointed in a lesser actor--or director--'s hands. Nate Parker is a very enjoyable stand out, worth watching in future roles. The writing likewise deserves acclaim for believable complexities even amidst the predictable rom com dynamic.",1430697600,,663,5.775510204081633

6930195,3,B00RFG788E,"I have been a little generous with my rating of Beyond the Lights.  I felt the story has been told before in many films about singers who become successful and who have an over anxious mother,being the one to help her made it.,  It was not a bad film, just one that as I said has been made before.  The girl was good and the mother played well.  I found the film to be filmed without much light in the background which made it somewhat difficult to see the scenes as they were filmed.  I feel  this film will appeal more to younger girls, and especially to some who might want to become singers themselves.",1429488000,,606,4.226086956521739

6930201,5,B00RFG788E,"Wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie when it first came out.  You know the trailer is always better than the movie itself.  I thought it would be contrived plot, moving along as expected with no character development, just assuming that the audience would be satisfied with just another black romance story.  Well, I am happy to report that this movie really moved me.  Sure, some parts were as expected but it was far from corny.  I enjoyed the romance as it developed - Kaz seemed real and I like that his character was reserved and didn't take advantage of Noni.  Both lead actors were great and believable.  Very sweet message and I was crying at the end.  I rented this first from Netflix and now I am purchasing so I can watch it again and again.  Also, didn't know that Gina Prince-Bythewood wrote and directed the movie.  Had I known that from the beginning I would have naturally had high hopes for this movie.

6930260,5,B00RFG788E,"I have been wanting to see this film for quite awhile, and I finally got the opportunity to see it. Here is what I think about the movie Beyond the Lights.

After her mother Macy convinces a local hair stylist to help her fix her daughter Noni's hair, the movie quickly transitions to a talent show. As it turns out, Noni has a gift for singing; and she sings the Nina Simone song ""Blackbird"". Many years later, Noni is a highly successful/popular singer and she appears to have it all. One night she meets a police officer Kaz, and after saving her from a near tragic circumstance they develop an attraction to one another. But there is so much more to Beyond the Lights.

A lot of good can be said about the movie; most notably Gugu Mbatha-Raw's outing as Noni Jean. Talented and beautiful, she gives Beyond the Lights a wonderful performance as Noni. I like the way her character progresses throughout the movie, and the chemistry between her and actor Nate Parker who also has a nice outing as Kaz. Minnie Driver stars as Noni's overbearing mother Macy and does a good job, while actor Danny Glover plays Kaz's father David and does a good job. Rapper MGK (Machine Gun Kelly) stars in a supporting role as Kid Culprit and does a satisfying job.

I also enjoyed the story in the movie. Romance does play a big part of the movie, but Beyond the Lights' themes and how the movie's characters all feel integral, are why I feel Beyond the Lights is a really good movie. Not once did I feel that the movie was boring or had pacing issues; and finally, Beyond the Lights is a very good film due to the actors/actresses(more notably Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the pacing and timing of the story, and the direction of Gina Bythewood. All in all, I consider Beyond the Lights to be

A Very Good Experience

Rated PG-13

6930295,5,B00RFG788E,"I wish I had just bought this movie instead of paying to rent it. I know it's going to stick with me for a long time. I will be purchasing the soundtrack for sure.

I won't go into detail on the plot, but what I liked about this movie was the raw, real emotion. I forgot at times that I was watching actors because the storyline, delivery, and chemistry were so authentic. This is not a bubblegum romcom. It's a romantic drama, emphasis on the drama. But this also means that the director took the time to allow the relationship to evolve naturally, rather than the standard move of throwing two random people together who all of a sudden decide to fall in love in 2 minutes. And I appreciated that. I loved being right there in the moment with them, feeling what they felt, crying when they cried. This director truly is not working enough of the last movie she was known for its Love & Basketball. I hope to see more of her work ASAP.

Edited to add: I have watched this movie 3 times in the past month, and it continues to resonate with me. There is a lot more to this movie than the initial love story. It's a story of finding who you truly are, finding your voice (literally, in her case), and following your own path, even when everyone else is pushing you in another direction. The Noni version of Blackbird, sung at the end, has been playing in my head for weeks, because of its catchy and also inspiring lyrics. I'm very glad I chose this movie (almost at random), because it has made a significant impact on me.",1427500800,,1521,4.314685314685315

6930297,3,B00RFG788E,"I can't say that was ecstatic about seeing BEYOND THE LIGHTS because it just seemed like a 21st century update of THE BODYGUARD, but for what it's worth, despite being narratively uneven and weighed down with cliches, it still is a compelling portrait of what goes on behind the scenes of people who are in the public eye. It stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Noni Jean, a cookie-cutter pop star who specializes in the oversexed, over-produced crap that tops the charts these days. One night, after winning an award for her latest single, she attempts suicide but is saved by the officer (Nate Parker) assigned to protect her that evening. From that point, a romantic relationship develops between them as they each figure out how to break out of the mold that other people have tried to keep them in, and begin to think and act for themselves. On paper, that sounds pretty good generally speaking, the film does a good job exploring those themes. The real standout of the cast is Gugu Mbatha-Raw who brings a youthful quality and emotional honesty to a character who, initially, is asked to do a lot of degrading things for the sake of ""image."" Her mother, played by Minnie Driver, also does a great job as this domineering, controlling personality who micro-manages her daughter's life. One begins to wonder who exactly she wants the career and the fame for: her daughter or herself. It's because of these qualities that she is an extremely unlikeable character, yet there is one stripped down scene in which another, sweeter side is shown and you get a little back story on why she is the way she is. Nate Parker also acquits himself rather nicely, although he and his storyline about being an aspiring politician are mostly sidelined in favor of Noni, although to be fair she is the main character. It would have been nicer for the story to be a little more balanced in that regard, but the juxtaposition of his and Gugu Mbatha-Raw's characters was established well enough. Sadly, all is not well with the film. It succumbs to a lot of the narrative cliches that plague films revolving around music and romance. Fortunately, there is a segment about halfway in which a much-needed break is taken from it all, in which Noni and Kaz get some one-on-one time. There were also a handful of moments that made me laugh unintentionally, such as when Noni takes Kaz on his first flight and they make love to Beyonce's song ""Drunk in Love."" And then there's Noni's label partner and sort-of boyfriend Kid who was a collection of ""white rapper"" stereotypes who made me cringe every time he opened his mouth. Overall, the positive elements do outweigh the negative and the film delivers a satisfying story about being true to yourself.",1427500800,7,2719,4.738396624472574

6930300,5,B00RFG788E,"This movie was EVERYTHING! If you loved ""Love and Basketball"" You will love this. They were written and directed by the same person, Gina Prince Bythewood. It is not, I repeat, not like ""The Bodyguard""(which I loved, too).  It is a story all its own. It is a great modern love story. It is about a rising pop star who has been forced to live out a hyper-sexualized persona in the music business, and what it costs her. Her soul is dying. She feels so trapped in it that she tries to kill herself. She is saved by the talently underrated Nate Parker(""The Great Debaters"", ""The Secret Life of Bees"", and ""Red Tails"").  He plays a cop that  just happened to be assigned to her on the worst night of her life. Minnie Driver and Danny Glover were great supporting actors as their parents.

But the real star of this movie was Gugu Mbatha-Raw. She is AMAZING!  She has incredible range. The movie she just did before this one was a period piece called ""Belle"". It took place in the 18th century England. That character was 180 degrees from this one. She's a British actress who can do a great American accent like she did in the now defunct J.J. Abrams' t.v. show ""Undercovers"" and Tom Hanks' ""Larry Crowne"". Although she uses her native British accent in this film. I saw interviews with her telling about the strenuous training she had to go through to become this character. She had to study celebrities of the past and present. She worked with Laurieann Gibson, Lady Gaga's choreographer. She worked with Beyonce's hairdresser, Lauryn Hill's makeup artist, and recorded the songs from the movie with the Dream. She did her own singing in the film, which was very good. She learned her craft so well that I believe that she could go out to become a pop star on her own now for real, if she so chose to do so. She is one to watch for the future.

The on-screen chemistry between Nate and Gugu was electric. There were lots of cameos in this picture, which was fun. It made the picture more authentic. I loved it so much that I saw it in the theaters 8 times. I bought for myself and some friends as gifts. The soundtrack is good, too. I whole-heartedly recommend this film.",1427500800,6,2169,4.4646464646464645

6930304,5,B00RFG788E,"I was surprised at how good this movie is.  It's about a young woman (think Rihanna) who is a singing super star.  She's glamorous and has a rapper boyfriend.  Her mother is her manager.  But all of that is a facade.  Despite the outward trappings of success and glamour, the young woman is not at all happy.  Once you see how her mother treats her, you'll see.  Kaz, the male lead, is really good looking and he's refreshing too. He has manners, he speaks grammatically correct English, he has a legitimate job, and he's honorable.  I think I enjoyed his character the most.  The romance is believable and just nice to see.  Given how good looking the main characters are, I thought there was going to be some huge, graphic sex scene but there wasn't.  This movie is really about the characters and how they grow and change.  At first I rented it and after I saw it I enjoyed it so much that I purchased it.",1427328000,2,908,4.37125748502994

6930308,5,B00RFG788E,"Powerful film about two bright and talented individuals whose parents push them to succeed to satisfy the latters' own agenda. Noni's mother is a survivor who strives for financial security for herself and her daughter -- striving to achieve this by exploiting Noni. Kaz's father has had a successful career in law enforcement, with ambitious plans for his son to enter politics in order to make a difference for his race. Gina Prince-Bythewood, who wrote the sceenplay (as well as directed the film), did a stellar job presenting parents of two different social class who end up disregarding their adult children's personal goals and desires. Children naturally want to please their parents and seek their approval, often allowing themselves to be treated as objects. This is easily recognized in athletics and entertainment, but it happens throughout our culture. Spoiler: The arc of the story is refreshing, as we witness how Noni and Nate empower themselves by taking control of their lives.",1427328000,,995,5.186335403726708

They felt like real people. I think the most relevant thing this movie highlights is staying true to your core. It's about your individuality and loving who you want to love and doing the things that will genuinely make you happy. Although this movie was about a relationship I thought it shed a lot of light on self-love and independence. It's a beautiful film that I am so glad was made.,1426032000,,552,4.368932038834951

6930377,3,B00RFG788E,"""Beyond the Lights"" manages the difficult task of humanizing the commodified  and soulless world of contemporary pop music.  The film portrays a Rihanna-like prodigy who is relentlessly pushed by her grasping mother, memorably played by Minnie Driver, to achieve pop stardom regardless of its personal cost.  The performances breathe life into a very old Hollywood storyline.  The director and screenwriter bravely dare to critique a pop music scene that sells skin as much as it sells music.",1425945600,,492,5.35064935064935

But that's definitely not a bad thing for this movie. The actors make it work. I didn't even recognize the actress from Belle.

6930417,5,B00RFG788E,"I stumbled across this movie while looking at the new releases for Tuesday and it looked pretty good, so I added it to my Watch list. A couple days later I again watched the preview and then rented it. This movie begins with Noni Jean (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) winning her first billboard award, getting into her car and arriving at her hotel. All seems well but she's not what she appears. She decides she's had enough and is ready to let her self fall off a balcony.

The young officer who guards her hotel room door lets her mother in and sees what's going on. He rescues her and she rescues him in a way as well. The story is excellent, touching at times and gives us a taste of life as a celebrity with all the pressure and control that goes with it.

I'd never heard of this movie which is a shame because it is one of the better films I've seen in a while. I even added two songs to my favorites playlist, Blackbird and Grateful.

As others mention, it does feel at times to be formulaic, but it works for this film. Gugu Mbatha-Raw transforms from hot body superstar to everyday girl so effortlessly. Her emotions are so real that your heart will break for her. Nate Parker is that real and honest person who also sees first hand the pressure and drive a loving parent can put on their children. He's a cop, gets shot at, and knows all to well that life is a precious thing. He wants her to be true to herself and be what she wants to be, not what the world expects of her. You can't help but cheer for these two to make it work. The movies doesn't disappoint. It is almost a modern day fairytale, but perhaps for young adults rather than children.",1425513600,11,1648,4.24203821656051

I thought it a meditation on being your true self despite superficial success. I especially like the scenes where the two leads were in Mexico, and you see the female lead strip off the phony exterior and embrace her true self: no weave, no make-up, absolutely beautiful.  I would recommend this move.  Found myself thinking about this movie days later because of the two leads.",1425340800,,651,4.666666666666667

I thought the actors and storyline was wonderful. It wasn't your average ""man save girl"" kind of story but instead they saved each other. The mother's character reminded me of the R&B singer Brandy mom. I remember when I watched the show featuring Brandy and her family she complained to her mom about her role as a mother/manager. Noni mom was an excellent manager but allowed the success of her daughter career cloud her judgment as a mother. The movie was entertaining and kept your attention throughout.

6930471,4,B00RFG788E,"I had seen this movie last week. What a hope for romance! Yet again, screenwriter and director Gina Prince-Bythewood knows how to bring a love story to life just like in movie Love and Basketball (one of my most favorite love movies since it debuted when I was a teenager!).

This love movie Beyond the Lights is definitely more on the view of adult life and how love with another adult is still necessary. This is why I greatly enjoy this story because it shows the individual lives of two people and how they have their own careers with success along with struggles THEN the love comes into the picture as a backdrop and flourishes for these two characters.

The music is spot on throughout the movie. (My opinion: Even when a Beyonce song is provided, which I did not like because slightly takes away from the scene since the song is highly popular; honestly I enjoy unknown songs or not well known music in movies because it makes you want to research more on their music after the movie (and it allows you to take the song for what it is during a scene, not the other way around).) Now the song ""Fly Before You Fall"" by Cynthia Erivo is superb!! And during the end credits ""Airplay"" by Chrissy Depauw is reminiscent of India Arie's ""Video"" (one of the songs that impacted my teenage years in the late 1990s and early 2000s when it debuted!), which is excellent and fits well into the overall story.

The actresses and actors were great, they all had chemistry from the main characters to the supporting cast. The styles of the two main characters is excellent, whomever was the stylist for the movie you know your skills, keep it up!

Now, one thing that makes me not give this movie an amazing rating because it has a predictable moments like any romantic movie like the mother-daughter disagreement (and the famous slap by the mother so screenwriter and director Gina Prince Bythewood I see you enjoy that scene in your movies i.e Love and Basketball, hahaha!).

I highly recommend this romance movie because you see two adult characters with their own careers flourishing along with struggles and love develops as the backdrop to their lives; no fairy tale at all with movie. As an adult myself now, this movie has brought me hope with wanting love as the backdrop in life! Out of ten stars, I give 8.",1425168000,4,2309,4.567632850241546

6930482,5,B00RFG788E,"This is a great movie!! Some may say that it is just another chick flick love story. But it is just so much more than that. It deals with issues that I feel woman of all races can identify with. Unlike Noni I am not a  ""pop star"" however, I still have to confront how I feel about my self worth and my identity as a woman in this society.

What is inspiring about the love story of Noni and Kaz is that from the start he loved the woman on the inside. He loved the real Noni Jean. There is nothing wrong with weaves and artificial nails. But when you are using those things to cover up the real you on the inside you suffer and so does the world. The world suffers because your light can't shine. The writer even put jewelry on Noni that looked like chains. It really showed the weight of it all. What I loved about Kaz is that he did not remove all her ""chains."" He showed her who she was and who she deserved and she removed all of her own chains.

Thank you Gina Prince-Bythewood, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and the rest of the wonderful cast and crew for creating this wonderful work!!!!",1425081600,4,1081,4.1380952380952385

Did Kaz ever run for office the way he was comfortable with, did the public accept her for her and not the fantasy. All these questions keep going through my head. I went back to see the movie opening night and the day it dropped on digital download I watched it at midnight. I have seen it at least 20 times now including this morning on my way to work on the train. I completely love this movie, Gugulethu and Nate did an amazing job of bringing these two characters to life, you believe they are in love with each other and the relationship is as messy as some really are. Gina has outdone herself with this one, I have no idea how she can ever top this one... sequel?!?!  If you are looking for a love story this is the one.
