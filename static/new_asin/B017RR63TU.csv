7515774,1,B017RR63TU,"Good actors, but you have no idea, what the story is about, yes he is AWOL, but AWOL from what, another movie I wished I would have shut off, really this one was a waste of money and time, and left you frustrated, no point in this movie at all.,,whoever reviews movies like this, before they are able to come out, should have put a stop to this one, in the middle of the movie there is some in breeders, a guy who beats his GF, and he and a corrupt cop, have some oriental girls in a storage area with tape on their mouths and are tied up, what, and where did that come from? pointless movie, I really like the main actor, but this movie was s***.",1456531200,6,647,4.023255813953488
7515775,3,B017RR63TU,"""This will all be over with soon."" Conrad Miller (Goss) is a marine in possession of classified government information. When he leaves his post to investigate what he has many people are upset. Now, he is not only trying to evade the CIA, but the LAPD, a Russian agent and an assassin who not only want the information for themselves, but him dead as well. I thought this was actually better than I was expecting it to be. Most of these action B-movies are identical and formulaic. While I can't say this one wasn't I will say it was entertaining enough to keep me watching. Luke Goss is a good choice for this genre of action but even he can't make a movie like this better than it really is. The movie itself is entertaining and I have seen much worse, but its really nothing amazing or anything to rush out and see. Overall, entertaining enough but really is the kind of movie to just put in and veg out to without having to really think. I give this a B-.",1453420800,6,959,4.303867403314917
7515816,2,B017RR63TU,"Acting was ok at best.  The storyline was not fully developed in the movie.  The ending still leaves you in suspense, which is not the worst thing but could have been better presented.  The different scenes add no value to the attempted plot.  It's not the worse movie but definitely also not a contender.  Bad acting makes me cringe.",1509494400,,334,4.593220338983051

7515818,4,B017RR63TU,weak plot..but surprised me at the end...plenty of action nice looking women not the typical hollywood stick and bones...no sex...much violence...not a lot of cussing.....hey mannn.....really thats rare for tv nowadayz...I enjoyed it !,1508457600,,235,5.9411764705882355
7515819,4,B017RR63TU,Good little entertaining movie. Lots of clean lines. Lots or references to past works. Some handy twists. Worth watching and worth time.,1505520000,,136,5.2272727272727275

7515821,2,B017RR63TU,It was a cussfest. There was only a few good characters in this. They have Conrad get beaten up and then he hesitantly saves the Asian slaves or he would have been no one to root for. How can you root for someone who steals info and sells to the Russians? I am disappointed in Luke Goss.,1505260800,,287,4.052631578947368
7515822,3,B017RR63TU,It was just a little cheesy but all in all I liked it.,1505088000,,54,3.230769230769231

7515824,2,B017RR63TU,"Some of the action scenes don't make any sense and the acting and dialogue is terrible and mediocre. The leading actor Luke Goss has done other films where the supporting actors have performed much better that in this film. The use of a 'Thug' from the 'Hood' as an operative killer working for the CIA is NOT very credible and the acting by Puerto Rican weather forecaster Jackie Guerrido was terrible, she should stick with weather reporting for Univision.",1502668800,,458,4.810126582278481
7515825,2,B017RR63TU,Wow..what a terrible movie. Really poor actors. So many plot flaws and filming errors. This thing was a joke...a bad joke.,1499644800,,122,4.857142857142857

7515851,3,B017RR63TU,"Not worth a 5 or 4 star but I didn't feel like I lost 1 1/2 hours that I'd never get back like a lot of Amazon movies.  Acting wasn't too bad, plot was pretty thin but action was not so bad.  Would I watch it again?  Probably not but it wasn't that bad considering my expectations were low.",1498003200,,290,3.8813559322033897
7515852,2,B017RR63TU,"Acting SO bad, especially the women. Not worth watching even for the action",1497571200,,75,4.846153846153846
7515853,5,B017RR63TU,I wasted mine so should you. What did I waste that you will waste as well? If you cannot make the tail end of the movie then think that the tail end is the beginning. Watch the movie backwards and you will get it. What the movie did not show was that agent got killed at the dinner date by the dinner date. If you read this till the end then you will watch it till the end.,1497312000,,373,3.7948717948717947

7515855,2,B017RR63TU,"I'm not sure what really happened in this film even after watching. Can you tell that this is a bad sign? I hope so because most movies you typically watch you can somewhat understand. This one not so much. The film's premise was unclear, cast of characters underdeveloped, and some of the scenes didn't make logical sense at least to me. Now, I usually can find one bright spot even in a below average film similar to this, but this one I couldn't find a single positive thing to mention. I'd say this is not good and this means it's not worth your time to watch.",1496534400,3,564,4.330188679245283
7515866,1,B017RR63TU,Reality took a major left turn.  SOOOOOOOOOOO bad I only made it about 20 minutes before I had to leave or my intelligence would have been thoroughly sucked out of my head.,1496448000,,172,4.375
7515867,2,B017RR63TU,Action - yes. Plat and story - no. A film worth watching needs both.,1496102400,,68,3.9285714285714284

7515869,3,B017RR63TU,"This movie had potential, but it seemed lacking to me. Was it money, production, writing, or a little of all of it? There are some action scenes that are pretty good, but other than that the movie wondered. It needed more explanation somewhere in the mix.",1495843200,,255,4.565217391304348
7515870,3,B017RR63TU,not bad,1495756800,,7,3.0
7515871,3,B017RR63TU,"fair action movie. yes, bad setup (what happened before) but most action movies come up with an unbelievable one anyways. They spared us the poorly written backstory! Other than that, its an ON action movie with some good and bad moments. Ending, as usual for these, leaves a lot to be desired. But I have seen much much worse  on prime. I watched it to the end, that is saying something",1495756800,,387,4.450704225352113
7515872,3,B017RR63TU,"This movie has it all: action, good acting, and nice looking babes.  The only thing lacking is a comprehensible plot.  I mean really, did they edit out half the movie?  Still, a must see for Luke Goss fans.",1495756800,2,206,4.368421052631579

8740350,2,B017RR63TU,"Weak movie even though it had some action in it.
Main Actor shot in the left shoulder and still fought
hand to hand combat with his enemies and won ?  Really ?
With a bullet in his shoulder ?

8740353,3,B017RR63TU,"great action scenes but it was cheesy af, RZA stick to music you suck as an actor.  this was as cheesy as iron fist. and whats up with the awol story line i didn't get that at all.",1519862400,,180,3.736842105263158
8740354,1,B017RR63TU,Pretty shallow in every way.  Dialogue is a series of cliches and one-offs that the average 5th graders might employ in their banter.,1518652800,,133,4.782608695652174
8740355,1,B017RR63TU,Terrible. The plot is invisible the acting is poor and the story is awful. Half of the movie is about events that have nothing to do with the ridiculous plot.,1517961600,,158,4.3
8740356,3,B017RR63TU,"Fight scenes OK at best. Female actors leave much to be desired performance wise. Dialogue primitive. No real ""hook"" in the story.
