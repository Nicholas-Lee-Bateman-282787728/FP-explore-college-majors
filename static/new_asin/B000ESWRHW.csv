Also the actions and interactions by Ram, Sita, Lakshma, Hanuman and others are according to Indian tradition, not westernized, which gives it more depth. It's not too scary for children and the English is excellent.",1481328000,,342,5.125

8113971,5,B000ESWRHW,"This movie of the Ramayana is excellent!  It accurately portrays the main plot of the original story.  The animation, though a bit dated, is superb.  It was great for my four year old son as well as my ninth grade humanities class.  I highly recommend it.",1416441600,,255,4.478260869565218

8113973,4,B000ESWRHW,"This film merely scratches the surface of the material in ""The Ramayana.""
Nevertheless, this is a film that is worthwhile seeing.  If you had never heard of
""The Ramayana"" before, this film is a good introduction.",1360800000,,213,4.916666666666667
8113974,4,B000ESWRHW,"This film, which is a joint Indo-Japanese production, was done with a sincerity that comes right out of the screen at you. It's too bad that the only available copies were taken from a worn film version. It should be cleaned up and done digitally in proper form, but from what I understand, there are legal isues which prevent that from happening.

That being said, we are lucky to have this treasure. It gives us a coherent, abridged version of the venerable epic and honestly treats the material here with more consideration and respect than any westerner has given our Homer on film. My tenth grade students read ""The Ramayana"" in their Ancient Literature course and love the epic and the film. Sometimes they feel that the portrayal of Ram and Sita are a bit melodramatic, but that's an issue of culture. The voice over for Soorpanaka can be a bit grating and laugh inducing, but all in all, they love it...even the musical numbers. The only reason I'm giving this four stars and not five is because of the scratchy video transfer and the above voiceover flaws. Otherwise this is a truly beautiful film.",1337731200,4,1107,4.676923076923077
8113975,5,B000ESWRHW,"Full marks to Yugo Saki who has handled the epic of a foreign country with such a diligence and love. Being used to reading and watching so many versions of Ramayana from my childhood, I remember how the very first look of movie seemed rustic to my eyes. But then the movie holds you and grows on you as you go on watching it. Infact, it has become a regular watch and re-watch film for us with our toddler son. I loved the songs of the film which fill you with a feeling of love and awe. The eyes of Ram are enough to transport you to Panchvati - the character of Ram has been portrayed really well and it makes one understand him more as a human. I specifically loved the English version of the movie since the voice-over has been excellent there - tried to make a search on who did the voice-over in english version but could not find any info on the net :(.

It is one of the first quality animation films of India (though not really by an indian studio) and remains one of my best movies watched ever. My 2.5 year old loves it. Thanks Yugo Saki - we are looking forward to seeing more from you.",1329955200,4,1099,4.135514018691588
8113976,5,B000ESWRHW,"I really like the Ramayana!  This version is, I think, the one from 1992, a joint effort from Japan and India.  Vaguely Amine-like (think big eyes) but fairly faithful to the story line.  If you would like to have the 'lite-quick version' of the Beloved Epic, this is for you!  Great for young and old alike.",1227225600,3,308,4.446428571428571
