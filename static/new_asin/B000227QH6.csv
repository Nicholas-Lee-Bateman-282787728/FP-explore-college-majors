8020258,3,B000227QH6,"Show took place at the Anaheim Stadium on a blistering hot day on June 19, 1977. It was Cooper's opening night of his 'King Of The Silver Screen' tour in support of this third solo album 'Lace And Whisky'. Sound quality is actually pretty good - wish I could say the same for the picture quality. Not necessarily all that bad, but it could be better. As huge of an Alice Cooper fan that I've been from the get-go, I wasn't exactly knocked out by this VHS video tape. Maybe if it had a legitimate release on DVD. As it is, I distinctly remember seeing this on a local TV station on a Sunday afternoon while visiting a great aunt of mine. The star himself Uncle Alice (apparently very drunk) only gets about ten minutes of air time with snippets of ""Is It My Body?"", ""Under My Wheels"", ""You And Me"" (glad he doesn't play this ballad anymore), ""Only Women Bleed"", ""Lace And Whiskey"" [I've always sort of liked this song], ""School's Out"" and a couple of others. Alice should've definitely gotten more time. His support bands included Nazareth (dug their couple of songs played live here), The Tubes (which were so-so) and the completely irrelevant Sha Na Na. An aging video that I would only watch every great now and again (that is, if I could find a working a VHF player).",1372636800,,1270,4.454935622317596

THIS IS MY REVIEW FOR AMAZON.COM  HERE GOES:

 IT WAS LIKE BEING AT WOODSTOCK(IN CALIFORNIA IN 1978). THE CONCERT LASTED ABOUT EIGHT HOURS, AND NO ONE LEFT! FROM THE OPENER, SHA NA NA STARTED THE FANS INTO A FRENZY WITH THERE GREAT SONGS, THERE ""GANG FIGHT"" SKIT TO THERE TRADEMARK CLOSING: ""R'N'R IS HERE TO STAY"" WITH SHA NA NA YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR A BETTER OPENER!!!!!

NEXT CAME Nazareth ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS TO COME OUT OF THE 70's! WHEN THEY WERE DONE BRINGING THE HOUSE(STADIUM) DOWN THE CROWED WAS MORE THEN READY FOR California's THE TUBES! ALONG WITH SOME GREAT MUSICIANS, THE TUBES WERE WELL KNOWN FOR THERE SHOWS, AND SKITS! LIKE ""WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE"" NOT TO FORGET ""I TALK TO YOU LATER""

OK, AFTER 8 HOURS OF NON STOP ROCKIN' IT WAS TIME!! ALICE COOPER HIT THE STAGE! FOR THOSE WHO STAYED THROUGH THE HEAT, IT WAS WELL WORTH IT!!! ALICE LEFT NOTHING OUT! NO ONE WENT HOME DISJOINTED!!!!!!!!! IF YOU CAN FIND THE VHS,OF IF THE DVD IS EVER RELEASED RUN, DON'T WALK TO THE NEAREST STORE, OR AMAZON.COM

AND BUY IT.............YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
