2015914,4,B0001MMGC2,"This film wasn't the best out there, and i'll admit that. It is definately not one that will win an oscar for anything, but in spite of the bad parts of the film, it wasn't all as bad as most make it out to be. The acting could have been better, and i'll admit that, but one thing that some people should realize is that, you cannot cast dancers to act. This is a dance movie, it's not a major theatrical drama that goes about a love story that is based around the world of hip hop.
I thought that the acting was bearable. You can actually sit through it without wanting to shoot yourself in the head, but of course the thing that drew my attention to this film was the dancing. I never saw ""Honey"" (Jessica Alba) but I've heard that this film was a thousand times better. As a dancer this film was great in the sense of the dancing, it was good to see a film that was about hip hop and no ballet (Center Stage, Save the Last Dance) it was a good way to get pumped if you are a hip hop dancer.
The problem with this film is simple, it wasn't the director, it wasn't the acting (well maybe a little bit), it wasn't the dancing, the problem with this film is that because it was released, hip hop is going to be a fad where all the young people of today will start a dance crew and try to mimic the movie's dance battles...this will last all but 3 months before everyone gives up.
never the less, it was still a good film and i do give it 4 stars.
if you are looking for a good dance film, this is a must see movie. if you are looking for a typical drama, don't see this and don't bash it if you cannot appreciate the hard work and rehearsal time it takes to get these dance sequences down perfect.",1077235200,15,1696,4.035608308605341
2015915,2,B0001MMGC2,"Good all around dance movie that does not hold up very well after you see it because the story is not very good out side the dance numbers that surround the movie. B2K do well for this kind of movie but we have seen this plot before, and done much better than this.

2015916,1,B0001MMGC2,"I have known for awhile that I'm just not as young as I used to be.  At the opening night of CLUELESS, it was painfully evident when all the kids around me were literally jumping up and down in their seats at the clever wisecracks on the screen, and me and my friend were looking at each other with puzzled stares wondering what exactly we were missing.  Now, a decade later, it has happened again.  Only this time the adults seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids were.  Somehow, amongst the horrendous acting and over-the-top scenarios, an entire theatre of kids and adults alike couldn't be more satisfied.  People were even making fun at just how bad some of the lines were delivered, but yet the second the music came back on, all was forgiven.  Sadly, I missed the boat.  It takes a little bit more than great choreography to keep me entertained these days.  However, I'm in the minority.  I guess this just isn't my genre.",1076284800,4,936,4.458823529411765

The story was good, it could be better though, BUT all the dance performances made you forget about the less good story. And off course the hotties who played in the movie, they did a great job. I totally freaked out during the movie, because it was so good! After the movie, you feel like dancing. You guys, you really have to see this movie.

2015953,1,B0001MMGC2,"The only good thing about this film was the dancing and that's it. The dancing couldn't save this film from the tragic acting of the entire cast Omari being the worst actor. Marques Houston has done better acting on other shows and films. Here are the problems I had with the film.

Liyah and David's relationship was nothing more than a plot point for angst in the group and it wasn't believable that they liked each other. Their lines were weak, corny, and came off forced and their acting was just horrible.

The whole group acting excited over splitting little amounts of money after the main two get a majority of it, like they just hit the damn lottery. GMAB.

Lil Kim needs to sit her ass down because she can't act looking like a f'd up Barbie doll walking around the stage trying to look important. Who wants to dance for her, she better go hire some roaches to dance in her video. Talking about straight hood, how about getting straight out of the movie, cause you did it no favors at all.

Why couldn't Elgin get a job, sitting there moping about not having enough to send his dumb sister to college and bills, etc. He made money dancing, what the hell did he spend the money on, cause he seem to have some name brand clothes and shoes. Delivering what, film never said what was in those bags that Elgin got his ass kicked for.

Tired of listening to Elgin and David complain about working for Emerald. Stop doing it then duh!

How did Steve Harvey's character get Emerald to back off just because he said so. Ok whatever.

Beautifull was just a dumbass flouncing around repeating her name like she would forget how to spell it, mom should've called her Twit

Why wasn't the mother (Jackee Harry) involved in her children's fights, she didn't do anything and the grandmother was involved. Speaking of grandmother who just pulls $1500 out like that for dancing of all things. If Elgin is so hard up in putting his sister through college & bills why didn't he just ask for the money to help his sister and mother, no he wants to use it for dancing...dumbass and the grandma's a dumbass too.

Lil Saint did I lose the memo where I'm suppose to feel sorry for him because he got killed. The kid didn't do anything significant in the film but be a hinderance.

The other crew saying they don't practice, now we know that's b.s., like they gonna know their teammates exact movements by going out there and free flowing, yea right!

B2K or whatever they are called are some of the worst actors in history.

The final dance is so typical of course a damn tie so the group can get back together after they disbanded. Same formula with them winning in the end.

This movie was just awful all around.",1303603200,,2700,4.452332657200811
2015954,3,B0001MMGC2,My 10 year old daughter loves to dance and this one is her favorite. It is really cool. We have watched it many of times since we got it.,1301616000,,137,3.7586206896551726
2015955,1,B0001MMGC2,"This movie is beyond lame. We basically have a 90 minute music video with a built-in corny love story as a filler. The dance moves are pretty much the same throughout the movie, the dancing crew in that final dance off names the crew after a kid who is a minor character, and we have rich Orange County white boys who think talking slang makes them look cool all of a sudden. Now the kid Little Saint who died in the movie was a genuinely sad part but I found it to be corny when they all of a sudden decide, ""Oh we'll name our crew after Little Saint!"" Little Saint was a minor character in that movie who we see for a grand total of 5 minutes it seems. I'm criticizing that part of the movie from a plot standpoint. And about the Orange County white boys who were talking slang, I cringed every time they were talking slang. Warren Beatty's character from Bulworth is 2pac compared to these 2. Now my opinions on the main characters: I'm very lenient when it comes to recording artists acting in movies unless your names are Omarion Grandberry and Marques Houston. These guys are just not cut out to be in movies and their performances in this movie are dreadful. Jennifer Freeman, who I like in My Wife And Kids, had an ok performance and could have a nice movie career down the road but this movie being on her resume certainly makes that prospect difficult. But to her defense, the terrible writing doomed her. Meagan Good, who is one of my favorite actresses, had an ok performance at times and other times it seemed forced. And I found it funny when Steve ""Mr. Old School"" Harvey was in a hip hop movie when he said in The Original Kings Of Comedy he wasn't into the all hip hop and rap stuff. But I guess he had a change of heart and his performance was actually the best one in the entire movie. Now that's no indictment on Steve Harvey. It just shows you how god awful this movie is. The director Christopher B. Stokes has directed only 2 or 3 movies and I believe that this movie was the only one of his that came out in theaters. If I were an actor, I'd much rather work with Roman Polanski or Mel Gibson than Christopher B. Stokes. There is a line in this movie that goes ""You suckers got served!"" Well yeah I was a sucker for seeing this movie and got served with the colossal mess that it is. Well I'm serving my review right back and the suckers are the producers, the writers, and the director. Now you suckers just got served!",1281139200,,2444,4.280777537796976
2015956,4,B0001MMGC2,"I thought that I could pop lock & break dance when I was young.  After seeing these guys in action, I realize that I only thought that I had the moves.  While the acting is weak & the plot is even weaker, the dancing in this movie is unbelievable.  B2K & IMX are greater dancers than musicians.",1277078400,,294,4.12280701754386
2015957,5,B0001MMGC2,"The competitive world of street dancing where crews battle each other for money and respect. Elgin and David are best friends and leaders of the best dance crew in the area. When another town's top group challenges them to a battle, David and Elgin, along with their buddies, must create and perfect the most cutting edge moves in order to remain on top. The stakes are raised as friends double-cross each other and true motives are revealed. When the biggest battle comes to town, David and Elgin must work past their differences to prove that they are still the best crew on the streets. The energy in this movie is undeniable.

2015960,1,B0001MMGC2,I'll keep this review brief. This was easily the worst movie of 2004. The whole thing is about two kids whose dance crew is challenged by some preppy wanna-be-black suburbanites who steal the crew's moves thanks to a treacherous friend named Sonny. Omarion and Marques's character fall out over Omarion dating Marques's sister and things get more problamatic from then on. The acting is atrocious and the dance moves might be cool at first but get pretty mundane after a while. Omarion as well as Marques Houston cant act. Lil Kim looks like recovering heroine junkie and the attractive Jennifer Freeman(My Wife and Kids) is whiter than Jenny McCarthy. You can tell this was a vanity project for the suspiciously effeminate Chris Stokes. And it still bombed! If you're into a movie all about dancing then go right ahead but if you're looking for something more than a dull dance film with heavily edited dance scenes look elsewhere. You just got served suckaz!,1211414400,,960,4.895705521472393

2015962,5,B0001MMGC2,"What more can one movie have?  The dialog is atrocious, the plot mundane and predictable, and the music blows.  Maybe the dancing is good, I wouldn't know--it is certainly hard to keep track of.

So why five stars?  Because if you love bad movies like I do, you have GOT to own it!

Lil' Kim is hilarious, albeit totally unintentionally.  ""We goin' take it to the streets!""  Gawd, that is pure gold.  Gold!

There's even a subplot about some little kid that ends up getting shot--with no emotional impact whatsoever.  I read a post on a forum somewhere that a girl wrote and said her boyfriend teared up during that part in the theater (and she actually thinks this is a good movie) which just adds to the hilarity.

I admit I only went to see it because my favorite singer was one of the main characters but it turn out to be a good movie. It about two best friends who love to dance and have they own team who compete in competitions. No one beat them and when this other team came in and beat them and took their money. To make a long story short and not to give too much away, both teams went to this big dance competiton and they won they money back and much more.(c.l.)",1192579200,,584,3.957627118644068

When I was younger we had movies that we thought were the best thing since sliced bread and here this movie comes along, clearly intended for teenagers to enjoy and there are a bunch of adults trashing it.

I saw no harm in the movie so called plots, the frequent unlimited dance moves or anything at all simply because the movie was not targeted towards my generations. When New Jack City came out, my parents didn't want to watch THAT!

Over all, for the kids, I think that movie proved its point. It had the hot guys in there that the teenage girls love and the beautiful girls in there that the teenage boys loved mixed together with some dance moves that only THEY can do... priceless!",1177459200,,878,4.128654970760234

And although this movie is several years old and the current
moves done are updated.... still its a cool look back to the past.

2015970,2,B0001MMGC2,"I have just finished viewing this movie and I must say I was left with a number of questions, but first, I must tell you, someone in my hometown had rented the movie and kept it so the movie store had to order another copy so naturally i thought that the movie would be good. In the meanwhile, it seemed like throughout the movie, the young men were trying out for basketball playoffs. I mean, in the beginning the movie started off with two rival teams in Los Angeles at Steve Harvey's dance studio or WAREHOUSE as they refered to it as Rad's in the movie. You get a feeling that Steve's character wanted to reach out to the boys in some sort of way. He was giving them advice and hard discipline, but then the story just doesnt add up. I am confused if the girl Jennifer Freeman's character was really Marques Houston's sister, because when we first see her in the movie, she is talking with her mom, who is played by Jackee, who is supposed to be Marques Houston's mother as well, but when Marques is jumped by thugs who take his merchandise, no one comes to the hospital to see him but his boys, not even his grandmother or mother, only his sister and then you only see his mother and grandmother together again at the end of the movie when they are competing at the dance tryout for $50,000. Also, what is with the rain scene. The boys are always on the basketball court between their dance routines, but you never hear about them going to school, is the movie set in the summer time? Then we see Marques and his sister set against the backdrop of a South Central L.A. neighborhood as we see in other movies that have black youth, struggling to make it in the streets. I think the only real product of this movie was Beautiful, played by Meagan Good and that is because she is so confident and her character will not allow anyone to disrespect or degrade her. She tells Omarion or David, ""you have to ask us to your car like ladies, we are ladies"" when he comes to pick them up from work. The grandmother has somewhat of an influence on Marques' character, but the only real reason to watch the movie is for the dancing. It is no ""Stomp the Yard"" by any means, because there is no story line. Its more of a zig zag criss cross type of storyline. I think that if they had've let Marques character get more instruction from Steve's character in the movie, the movie would've had more direction, and then they wait till the last minute to put Lil kim in the movie and she didn't even judge the dance contest fairly until Steve Harvey said, ""you got to take it to the streets, this is to important to them boys."" I think it was a ploy to lure more age 11-17 year olds into the movies.",1172448000,,2685,4.28740157480315
2015971,1,B0001MMGC2,"This movie was so bad that I'm not sure I even want to waste my time with a review, but alas, I must say SOMETHING.  Plot is horrible, just plain horrible.  I'm embarassed for the cast, although it's not like they'll put out any better movies themselves, but still, this is beyond horrid.  I will say that I love Meagan Good, mostly because she's hot, but in 'Brick' she showed promise for maybe she'll mature into a better actress as the years press on.  Other than the horrid plot there is some MTV dancing that is really the only reason to watch this film, and the dancing is pretty cool, but a movie like 'Honey' has the same dancing but a slightly better plot so I'd say skip this drivel and watch something else, like a music video, at least thats over in five minutes!",1164844800,2,775,4.324137931034483
2015972,1,B0001MMGC2,"Frankly, I do not know why I decided to watch this. The most abysmal factor about this film is the direction. I would estimate this to be a MTV film and nothing stellar. The acting is garbage and the plot has been done (ex. Bring It On).

There is nothing much to say about this film. It has that lackluster 'bring it' vibe that turns me off. I cringed throughout and nearly cried from embarassment. Not to mention the genre itself is outdatted. The film also has a negative implication, stating that kids at the age of 15 are involed in drug deals and will have to put their talent to use in order to get money - a timeless stereotype.

One of the worst films you'll see, simply put. Avoid this.",1154908800,3,696,4.265151515151516
2015973,5,B0001MMGC2,"""You Got Served"" is a wholly commercial enterprise, a low-budget film about hip hop dancers starring B2K and Marques Houston, and written and directed by their manager. Although its stars have acting resumes, they are by no means good actors. The production values are so shoddy that the climactic scene shows the same crowd of extras over and over again in the same small slice of arena seats, as if the filmmakers were too lazy even to pretend like it was a real event. The plot is unbelievably cliche, the dialogue is banal and the stereotypes are egregious. Despite these flaws, and in fact because of them, I enjoyed every minute of it.

Although the following paragraphs reveal much of this film's plot, the events that unfold are so formulaic and predictable that you could probably take a wild guess right now and get about 80% of it right.

Our two protagonists, David (Omarion) and Elgin (Houston), begin the film as best friends and leaders of a top notch ""crew"" of dancing homies. David has even found love with Elgin's little sister. But when they're challenged by their future rivals, ""Wade's crew"" out of Orange County, things take a turn for the worse as they sell drugs to raise the bettin' money. Wade and his fellow honkies look like the rejects from O-Town tryouts, and their lineup includes Kevin Federline. (Seriously.) Then the wily white boys get a Judas from David and Elgin's crew to teach them all the hot ghetto moves, and they humiliate our heroes at the dance-off. That's when Wade - you have to see this guy to understand how ridiculous he is - slams the door on the idyllic first act with the best line in the movie: ""You're just mad...'cause tonight you suckas got served!""

After that, everything goes to pieces as Elgin turns on David for chasing tail instead of working on his moves, and tells his sister to ""go home and stop acting like a ho!"". This tirade by Marques Houston is worth the price of admission alone. The crew splinters into weaker factions, and it ultimately takes the martyrdom of Walt from LOST to bring some healing.

Things only get better as Lil' Kim arrives to take the role of deus ex machina. Her proclamation that the dance battle between Wade's crew and Elgin's new posse should be settled by a ""straight street"" showdown, compounded by a move by Wade that has to be the most colossal tactical error possible in that situation, allow David and Elgin to reunite for one final duel with their OC enemies. Gee, guess who is going to win? All I will reveal is that in the end, the tiny slice of crowd goes wild and chants ""Served! Served! Served!""",1154476800,,2605,4.619870410367171

Of course, you will have those who hate it just because it deals with dancing and hip hop, but through all of that, there is a real story behind it. This movie isn't just about dancing, but about family and friendship among other things. The story of the gang demanding it's money adds depth to the story as well. The dancing is great in this film, but that's not all the film offers. If you have doubts about the movie, watch it, and you will find that you'll like it better than you thought. It does have some slow moments, but overall, the movie really is enjoyable.",1151107200,,733,4.280575539568345
2015975,3,B0001MMGC2,"First off, I would like to ask for Chris Stokes to retire at movie writing. This movie has no plot, no good acting, lots of loose ends, overall, no point. It was a very ""teeny bopper"" type of movie, clearly created to market B2K, and in my opinion, introduce the world to Omarion as an actor. I did not spend my money in the theaters and did not spend it to rent. I did not want to waste my time watching it until my sister bought it and I had nothing else better to do.... And I ended up actually liking it!! The dancing, the dancing, the dancing. That is the ONLY reason to watch this movie. Oh, and seeing Marques Houston and Omarion shirtless :)  My problems w/this movie:

-Meagan Good had no purpose

-Why did Omarion look like a bum the entire movie? His hari was terrible and his clothes were outrageously too big. Ironically, he still looked good...

-What ever happened to Sonny after the original danceoff? Did he ever ""get his"" like David said?

-What was the purpose of Lil Saint?

-Why in every scene, did almost every person have to have a line? Even when it was unnecessary...

-Why does Chris Stokes have to put his mom in every movie? (She was the nurse at the hospital when they went to see Saint, and she was the grandma in House PArty 4 -- another one of Chris Stokes jokes!)

-Why Lil Kim? When has she ever had hot dancing in her videos??

I won't lie... I have been watching this movie for the past 2 weeks.. and I really like it! I'm going to go any buy it for myself (it's $7.50 at Target). But the acting is just painful. I agree w/one of the other reviewers, that Marques Houston played down his acting.

Although the dance ""interlude"" was nice, I could've done w/out the tribute to Usher's ""U got it Bad"" dance scene in the rain.

The best dance move as in the danceoff when they did the slow motion move-- classic! Otherwise, it seems like there was too much trying to go on, and not enough was answered at the end of the movie. They danced, they lost, they danced, they won, and everybody's friends at the end. Cheesy movie... but the dance scenes make up for it...",1145923200,,2096,4.281012658227848

I figured it was just a movie that was a definite moneymaker because basically every girl in the world loved B2K when it came out and they were going to go see it just for that. The story was weak and the acting was below weak and I was disappointed because it seemed Marques Houston watered down his acting skills so he wouldn't outshine B2K. Even though the movie itself isn't good based on acting skills and story it's still very entertaining.

You can hate boy groups and B2K or IMX or whatever but the truth is they dance the movie right into worth watching. The things they did in this film are crazy and it takes a lot of talent to do what they did. I can't lie and say this movie was trash and horrible because it's a pretty good movie when they're not talking.

It almost seemed as if the actors were trying too hard. You could definately tell that they were not experienced actors. The scenes that were suppose to be dramtic were a little over done. But they did give it a good try.

This movie is worth buying if you are a fan of the actors and enjoy watching good dancing, but not if you are expecting a movie with excellent actors and a deep plot. It is almost as if the people filming the movie ran out of time and did not get to fully develop their ideas for the movie.

personal observations

1.  Does the mom even live in the house with Elgin and Liyah?  The g-ma had a bigger role in the movie

2.  When was the last time your g-ma actually ""checked her stash"" and gave you $1500.00 to put on the line in a dance battle because some white guys called you out?

3.  Speaking of that, when was the last time you put up 5g's in a dance battle?

4.  What was Elgin and David delivering for Emerald in those BRIGHT MULTI-COLORED gymbags anyway?  Drugs or Mittens and Scarves?

5.  I really liked the part where Elgin threw the gymbag straight up into the air when he got jumped by those dudes in the hallway.  I also like how they were kicking and punching at air and everything they threw seemed to miss him.  But perhaps I was wrong, the fake blood did the trick...

6.  Lil Saint was the sad point of the movie.  This little 7 yr old kid got shot and died because he hung around a group of ruffnecks who were so bad the cameramen were afraid to film them!  Good thing David was there to let him be in his dance group and stay out of trouble

7.  Come to think of it, I never even seen Lil Saint do one stinkin dance step.  That kid was a hustler - He deserved to die in that movie!

8.  And what was up with Beautifull?  She was so fine she had to let it be known everywhere she went!  Whatever; I'd call her Nancy just to screw with her head.  She went from Eve's Bayou to this?

9.  How exactly did big, bad Steve Harvey take care of the big time debt that Elgin owed to Emerald anyway?

10.  Lil Kim + Acting = Nuff said....

I got a couple more, but I'll stop on that note.  I heard Lil Kim may be going to the pen for perjury.  What they should do is put her in home confinement and make her watch this poor excuse of a movie at least 15X a day for five years!  I can't think of a worser punishment!

2016002,2,B0001MMGC2,"'You Got Served' has only one good point about it, and that is the dancing sequences in the street style.  The gravity-defying dances, always exciting and amusing to see, are simply great.  And the rest of the film?  Nothing worth your time.  Be ready to push the fast-forward button, for you need to do that so often.

Again I say, the dances are wonderful.  The film is basically about the two boys Elgin and David, the unbeatable dancers.  With them as the main force, their team are actually invincible at the dance battles until one day some other team (two white kids as leaders) 'stole' their dances.  Does not this sound like 'Bring It On'?

The generic story is so awfully done that you start to wish that someone cut the film by 60 minutes, and make it a music video.  Think about this.  Elgin and David, when they are not at the dancingfloor, they are A) playing basketball in the neighborhood; B) carrying some stuff for underground employer: C) dating a girl (whose brother happens to be your best pal); and D) got involved in some trouble because of B or C.  Oh, and don't forget that one of their friends got shot by a gun.

If someone should write this kind of script, he would be blamed for relying too much cliche.  If that film features Afro-Americans (as this film does), he would be accused of stereotyping them.  I don't know anything about the writer/director, but I only hope that he realizes it by now.

The dancing, and probably its soundtrack (which I found good), are the only reason that you should see it.  Otherwise, as to acting, editing, and most of all storytelling, 'You Got Served' is one of the strongest contenders for the worst film of the year.",1106265600,2,1684,4.52317880794702

As far as the storyline goes, it is typical of ego-induced projects. (Sorry Mr. Stokes!) However, the only thing that saved this movie was the well-choreographed, gravity-defying dance moves that I have ever seen. (I watched it, but I still don't believe it!) So, for all the B2K fans and IMx fans out there, this is a good movie to watch if you want to take up a new hobby, but don't bother watching the whole movie, skip to all the dancing scenes and enjoy them because there is nothing else to enjoy about the movie. A boring, repetitive, predictable movie with an unoriginal plot, which has all been done numerous times before.

As for cameo appearances by Wade Robson and Lil Kim - please, for the love of...! Stick to your day jobs!

There are also some cameo appearances from Wade Robson & Lil' Kim.

2016015,1,B0001MMGC2,"""You Got Served"" is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. To give this piece of cinematic s**t even one star is being generous beyond words. It's so bad, it's not even laughable (at least Showgirls was funny).

If you're wondering why or how anyone could rate this at anything greater than two stars, just take a look at the grammar in most of those reviews and you'll have the answer.

2016016,1,B0001MMGC2,"""You Got Served"" harkens back to those films from the `80s like ""Breakin'"" and ""Beat Street,"" low budget jobs aimed at devotees of competitive street dancing, a niche market if ever there was one.  ""You Got Served"" demonstrates that while the dance moves may have advanced in style and sophistication in the past twenty years, the plotting certainly hasn't kept up with the pace.  In this film, a popular LA dance crew from the `hood is challenged to a $5,000 showdown by a rival crew from, of all places, Orange County.  Add to this a dash of gang violence, a dollop of puppy-love romance and an MTV-sponsored competition finale and you have the makings of a pretty standard youth-must-be-served flick.

A movie like ""You Got Served"" clearly exists for its dance sequences and little else.  The choreography is fine, I guess, but without an interesting story to effectively tie the routines together, even the dancing becomes tedious after awhile.  If you can look beyond the dull story and amateurish acting, you may enjoy ""You Got Served.""  Otherwise, it's a loser's bet all the way.",1092268800,16,1086,4.869565217391305
2016017,2,B0001MMGC2,"You Got Served came out at the time when R&B group B2K were blowing up the charts and on the heels of their breakup. More or less, I think the breakup itself was a plot to get publicity for this movie. Anyway.....

 This movie (if you want to call it that) seems to have no real direction or plot. I think someone actually thought that this movie would be good simply because B2K, IMx, Lil' Kim, LaLa, Wade Robson, and Steve Harvey, etc., were in it or making cameos. Granted, the movie opened number one when it was released, yet it dismally and thankfully fell flat after a couple of weeks.

 The dancing in this video is off the chain! If you're like me and grew up in the hood, then this movie will appeal to you and actually have you watching the moves and rewinding them to see them again. Hood peeps know how to settle differences on the dance floor. That's how we do. lol.

 The saddest part of the movie, although extremely predictable, actually had me shed a tear. I won't give details for the people who haven't seen this one, but if you do check it out, you know exactly what is going to happen before it is announced; yet it is still touching to the heart and might have some of the more sensitive viewers crying.

 Now, I have to say again that someone actually thought this movie would succeed solely on the cameos and the dancing. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. The acting in this film is terribly sub-par. Whoever thought that B2K could actually act needs to go back to the drawing board. The only real B2K member that I thought actually could have some sense of acting was J-Boog, and even he seemed bland and dry. Jennifer Freeman, who I absolutely love on ""My Wife and Kids"" doesn't deliver at all. Also, Meagan Goode, who isn't the prettiest thing in the world, is playing the same role she is known for in all of her music videos and movies....the ""pretty best friend wannabe ghetto"" girl. Let's get this girl some acting classes and then we can try again. Another thing: If this dance-off at the end was such a colossal event, where was BET, VH1, or any other music outlet? MTV seemed to be the only one there and even their ""coverage"" of the event was quite flaccid.

 B2K, we all know that you can dance, IMx, we all know you should retire, and Chris Stokes, no, just no. This movie is strictly for the die-hard B2K fans and no one else!!!",1091232000,6,2380,4.3521444695259595

The dancing is good. I guess. But how much breakdancing can you take before it starts to get on your nerves? I was so bored during the movie that I even started to play on my cell phone in the theatre.

The story line is predictable and boring, the acting is flat, and even the dancing was drawn out and repetitive.

2016019,2,B0001MMGC2,"I think it's really sad that this movie has a rating of three and a half stars, but considering some of the reviews' language I guess that would be predictable. Anyway, this movie was almost absolutely horrible, and I'd have given it 1 star if it weren't for the dancing.

 The plot: A group of guys in the inner city are trying to make it as big dancers -- or at least lord it over the rest of the 'hood -- but things keep getting in their way. They are betrayed by one of their team's members; they get caught up in a drug trade; and one of the main characters begins dating one of the other main character's sister. Trouble ensues. The plot was rather sketchy and not very good at all -- it rambles all over the place, jumps from story to story, and drags out way too long -- but it could have survived if the acting were any good. OH WELL. Meagan Goode, Steve Harvey, and Elgin's grandmother were the only good actors in this movie, but unfortunately they have very small roles. I don't know WHY they made Omarion ""David"" -- they could've given it to J-Boog, who even in a small role proves he's the best actor in the group. Omarion was HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BAD and Marques Houston, who used to be a much better actor, is almost as bad. Jennifer Freeman is usually decent but in this movie she was also very bad.

 The only thing that saved this movie was the dancing; if I were to watch it again (Mommy please save me), I'd probably scan through the acting scenes and skip straight to the dancing, especially watching Wade and his crew (who in my opinion was better than Elgin's crew, but whatever). It probably would've have been better to just cast this movie as two groups trying to make it in the hip-hop industry, minus the drug trading, the my-best-friend-wants-to-get-with-my-sister subplot, and the ""urban"" lifestyle thing.

There wasn't a plot, the characters possessed no depth - all that transpired was some disjointed dancing, and a very unannounced (almost a complete surprise) dance-off at the end of the film. The ""Special Features"" section on the DVD, frankly, was much more entertaining than the movie. To listen to the producers talk as if this were a serious film transcends comedy. And to hear ""actors"" talk about how easy it was for them to fall into character - that was priceless. There were no characters. There were cardboard cutouts that lip synched some dialogue, and then some line dancers, who looked suspiciously like the cardboard cutouts. Oh, and a bunch of sideline cheerleaders, along with Steve Harvey, Li'l Kim (who should be embarrassed by her choice of clothing - you shouldn't wear shirts like that unless you have something to show off), Jackee, Wade Robson (the guy who did choreography for N'Synch and others), and some other cameo appearances by names I didn't - and don't ever want to - recognize.

However, if you love dancing and you are a fan of good music, you will love this movie. You Got Served contains some of the best dancing you will ever witness. It is amazing. I won't go into details about the dancing because you have to see it to believe it.
As far as the acting, I think the members of B2K did a great job, especially since this was their first movie. The most impressive actor of the bunch was definitely Jarell Houston, aka J-Boog of B2K. There is one particular scene in this movie where his acting skill are absolutely phenomenal. He makes the viewers actually feel what he is going through. Marques Houston, who is also an incredible actor (if you haven't got his debut solo album, MH, go get it! It is amazing!), does a fantastic job portraying the character of Elgin.
The plot of YGS is not as bad as the critics say it is. You will enjoy it if your mind is open to it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be kept on the edge of his/her seat and would like to witness some unbelievable dancing. Even if you were not a fan of B2K, or aren't a fan of Marques Houston, there is still a chance that you'll enjoy this movie. If anything, go see this movie for the dancing.

The other guys dance moves were so sick that my friend went into coma.  In other words, be careful when you try to serve someone, cos they may serve you back, and then it'll be on.  All the actors are good looking, so this is a great movie.  I mean, since when did movies have to have a good plot or even decent acting?  Exactly, they don't, as long as the actors are hot.  That's what I love about this movie, the actors don't care if they can't act, they just have to look good.
Now, on a serious note, I'm glad this movie was made.  South park wouldn't have been able to make fun of it had it not been made.  If you haven't seen that south park, its a must.  Also, this paves the way for more parody movies that will be able to attack this one viciously.  I guess this movie went over my head, I'm not from the streets, so I never knew what went on there, I guess I was just ""tripping"".  Oh wait, you mean thats not what really happens in the streets?  They don't really have dance-offs?  I wonder if the people who made this movie were trying to do a remake of Zoolander with dancing instead of modeling.  I guess they didn't realize that Zoolander isn't supposed to be a serious movie.  It says a lot about our future when all the kids say they loved this move because ""So-and-so was so hot.""  So what if there are great dance moves.  One person said they should have made this a documentary instead, I agree with this.  If it was a documentary I wouldn't have to make fun of it for being such a horrible movie.  Do yourself a favor and don't get served by watching this movie.  I recommend any movie that requires an inkling of thought, something that completely bypassed this movie.  I guess thats why so many people liked it, people just hate to think nowadays.

The greatest battle was the very last one the Lil, sanits verses wades crew. With its combination of breakdancin,hip hopin, and somewhat of some drama this movie was tight. If you a gangsta kinda guy get this right away.",1087171200,,725,4.185714285714286
2016036,3,B0001MMGC2,"I got this movie because I'm just soo in love with B2k. They dance really good. I mean, they're doing backflips and everything and I'm telling you your jaw will drop at all the moves they did. It was surreal! However, I believe that the dancing made up for their acting. I guess it's good considering this is their first ""major"" movie. But it needs work. One part of the movie that made it cheezy (that means phoney) was the fact that they were carriers for this boy named Emerald who's supposedly a drug dealer. I don't get it why don't they just go and get real jobs! I don't really go for ghetto movies, unless it's a comedy. I guess that's what made it look cheezy.
There WERE other parts of the movie that made it better though, and even surprise me a little. Like the fact that they all looked like normal people in this movie. I know it sounds cheezy, but when you're a fanatic like me, you just expect that they would be an exception. They weren't. If they had never come out as B2k and passed me in the street, I would've just looked and kept going. That's how ""normal"" they looked. That's one thing I liked, though.  They didn't try to make superstars act like normal people while they still looked like they came outta Hollywood. That got them a few points with me.
Another thing that surprised me was that I knew Omarion would be kissing that girl Jessica Freeman, but I didn't know he would be doing it twice! They looked like they might put some tongue in it--but didn't. Dang!
Another thing I didn't realize is that they showed J-Boog in a brother-like, almost fatherly, light--especially to the little boy called Lil' Saint. I figured as fine as he is they would show him as a player. It made him look sexier!
Well, that's all I got to say-- Glad I got THAT all out!!",1087084800,,1783,4.338323353293413

2016039,1,B0001MMGC2,"Believe the hype - this film really is as bad as they say it is. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is ridiculous:
'What are you thinking about?'
'About a lot'.
As for the sub-plots, they are terrible, including the too nicely done romance between Omarion and Jennifer Freeman or worse still, Marques Houston gets jumped while running errands for the local, too cliche gangsta, causing unrest between him and his 'boy' Omarion, why doesn't he just get a real job at a fast food place or something? Also, are we supposed to feel sad when the little ten-year-old boy dies? He's in the film for two scenes and Chris Stokes thinks us as an audience is going to care enough about him? Sorry Chris, we're not that stupid.
Unless you're into hip-hop dancing or a fan of B2K, then I strongly recommend to STAY AWAY from this film. Ladies and gentlemen - this is filmmaking at its very worst.",1086393600,4,885,4.5375

The plot is weak and very, very predictable.  However, if you like dancing, then you will get plenty of it in this movie.

2016042,1,B0001MMGC2,"O my gracious, this was the worst movie that I have seen in I don't know when.  Peer pressure is NOT cool because that was the only reason they got my $6.  This movie was beyond awful...B2K is the weakest thing to hit the music scene. They are always in our faces and it gets even worse with a movie.  The only thing that saves this movie was the dancing.  Seriously.
I spent this entire film talking about how crappy it was.  The acting was horrible, the plot was ridiculous (can you say Bring It On? And it probably goes further back than that!), and it should have been refused by the studio.
The ONLY funny part in the movie was when the girl from My Wife & Kids tried to show us how ""down and hip"" she was.  Only it backfired when she couldn't say ""trippin'"" and said ""tripping.""  I bet theaters everywhere laughed at that moment and only that moment.  And let's not forget skanky Lil Kim and her botched lipo-job.  Ugh.
Anyways, this movie was horrible.  Do you self right, and buy or rent something else.",1085184000,,1011,4.301587301587301

If you watch the movie some of the parts i didn't get like about the whole dancing and i guess delivering drugs??I mean they could of think of something better but don't look at it like that Like i said its all about the dancing its one hell of a dvd!,1085011200,,539,3.9541284403669725
2016044,4,B0001MMGC2,"I owe both movies. Now critics are saying that ""Honey"" was a bad movie. It's depending how you look at it. Both of these movies were not meant for oscar winning of course. Their both inspirational movies for a younger crowd. The movie ""Honey"" I liked very much though it wasn't what I was expected I thought it was gonna be like the movie ""You Got Served"". Than I realized that movie relay a good message to all people. That ""Honey"" played by J.A. became famous and used her fame to help her community. Now for ""You Got Served"" was meant for a hip-hop movie but also sent out a good message. It dealt with conflicts, a little bit of the gang life, a death, lies, and most importantly strong friendships.",1084924800,,703,4.374045801526718

2016046,4,B0001MMGC2,"I give this 4 Stars, not because of the story, but more for the visuals. Its one of those movies where you'll just watch your favorite scenes over and over and skip over the hollow acting. You definately aren't going to watch it for the story, you just want to see dancing. If you're into crazy b-boys its basically something to watch in awe but this isn't realistic at all. Its WAY too choreographed for something they label in the movie as ""Straight Street"". The whole my ""crew"" VS your ""crew"" is a bit too pushed, no ones going to go out and settle an arguement on the floor...reminds me of when comedians make fun of the 80s by saying instead of gangs fighting they dance it out. HAHA! But its just a movie right? Certainly not for everyone, but those those hip hop fans, you'll pick it up just to watch and re-watch the creativity that hits the floor. I did enjoy this movie in the theaters. And I probably will watch it one more time through when I get the DVD. But after that I'll just select the scenes I want for the music/dancing. I do have two major complaints though. 1) Jennifer Freeman has to be the worst actress in this movie. Everyone else is at least somewhat believable. She's attractive and all but..""Why are you trippING?"" had to be the WORST reading of slang ever! And my second complain : The appearance of WADE ROBSON. My oh my..for a movie that goes so far to say its ""street"", they brought in the dude who's known for choreographing dances for Britney Spears and Nsync. What a great choice...IN BIZZARO WORLD! So yea, pick this up to point at the screen and say Wow that was pretty cool. Don't watch it and say I can't believe he would push his friend on crutches!",1084752000,,1690,4.368253968253968

2016050,1,B0001MMGC2,"Quite simply put, this has to be one of the worst films ever made. I borrowed a copy of this from work because I saw it listed on IMDB's bottom 100 films. It out ranked such schlocky classics as Manos Hand of Fate, Glitter, and Plan 9 from Outer Space. I knew I had to see this movie.
Unlike those other films, this isn't even remotely funny with how bad it was. Every single urban genre cliche is pulled out of the bag and defficated all over in this flick (as if it hasn't already been done enough.) I guess the dancing is good, if you consider acrobatics combined with full body seizures dancing.
The saddest thing about this is that it topped the box office in it's opening week. That says alot about today's youth.",1084579200,3,719,4.294117647058823

You not only get some serious B2K and IMX action in this movie but for anyone from Canada out there, the guy that plays Wade (the leader of the rival crew) looks like the guys from B44.
The only problem I had with this movie is that Lil' Kim has absolutely no acting abilities and she wears this string bikini top even those she has some crazy love handles, and her nameplate neclace is a way too big for someone whose name begins with Lil'.
That girl who plays the daughter from My Wife and Kids is in the movie too and she plays David's (Omarian) girlfriend...its a cute story but takes away from the best part of the movie...The Dancing!
Hopefully the DVD will have some special features teaching you how to dance so I can try these moves out at home and go to my local boxing ring and challenge other crews.
I am so excited for this to come out on DVD, I might have to request some days off from work so I can watch it over and over again...Eeeeeeeee!!!!!
