Saiga waits until the wedding to strike. As Kagura's condition worsens and she loses the ability to fight her fate, Saiga busts in to save her from a sad fate.

This anime starts off with a bang. It's a constant thrill ride with some cool characters that have alarming special powers. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. This anime is very strange. The premise is very original and kinda takes you by surprise. If you've seen Eyes Wide Shut, you can kind of get a feel for the type of vibe this show has. It's not as perverted as Eyes Wide Shut, and this is mainly an action series,but the mood is very similar. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anime fans that don't mind a little weirdness sprinkled in with their anime.",1355011200,,922,4.488095238095238
