1712631,3,B000066HAS,"I Am Sam tells the story about a mentally challenged father trying to raise a daughter all by himself, but when she turned 7 and began to exceed him intellectually, his ability to care for her comes into question by the social services.  Now, with the help of an eccentric lawyer, he is fighting to regain the custody of his child or risk losing her forever.
As you undoubtedly have read, Sean Penn gave a brilliant performance here, I'm not sure whether it's Oscar calibur or not, but he definitely gave it his best.  Penn's portrayal of Sam was sweet and heartbreaking at the same time, without being overbearing or excessive, and that made the whole experience all the more believable.  Michelle Pfeiffer also did a decent job as the obsessive compulsive lawyer Rita, a troubled mother and a frustrated wife, her own life is falling apart as she attempts to help Sam to rebuild his.
Unfortunately, the other aspects of the movie doesn't work as well.  The premise is a good one, but the film is overly manipulative and sentimental as it plays with the audiences' emotions.  Furthermore, the film is about half an hour too long, many scenes seem to drag on endlessly without purpose.  As a whole, I Am Sam just doesn't have the polish and effectiveness it strive to achieve.  If you are a fan of this kind of drama, you probably won't be too disappointed, but if you don't like sappy movies, I suggest you stay away from it and watch something else instead.",1011830400,9,1459,4.61003861003861
1712632,5,B000066HAS,"From the first moment I AM SAM began, I realized I was in for a rare movie treat.  As part of a movie class I was fortunate to recently preview I AM SAM and find now, several weeks later that I am still as enthusiastic about this film as I was when I first saw it.
Sean Penn, and I cannot say enough about his performance, plays Sam, a mentally challenged adult with the mental capacity of a 7 year old.  We first see him working at Starbucks while he puts out sugar packets in an obsessive manner, calling out orders over and over and endearing himself to customers in his charming Sam manner. Suddenly, Sam is called away and we watch him enter a hospital and witness the birth of his daughter. Elated and awestruck, Sam names the baby girl Lucy, after the Beatle song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Unfortunately Lucy's mother isn't intersted in either Sam or Lucy and as they leave the hospital, with Lucy in Sam's arms, simply runs away from them.  Ill prepared and ill equipped to raise a child, Sam somehow managaes to bring up Lucy with the help of a kindly and eccentric neighbor played to perfection by Dianne Weist. As the years go by, we see glimpses of Lucy growing up as she plays with Sam, as they read Green Eggs and Ham together before bedtime, as Sam buys shoes with Lucy aided by his friends who are also mentally challenged and finally when Lucy begins school. And while I know realistically that Sam being capable of raising Lucy mostly on his own till she reaches grade school might be unlikely, Sean Penn as Sam is so loving and good with Lucy, that I truly wanted to believe this could happen.
While it isn't firmly established how Sam and Lucy manage to evade child welfare agencies all of this time, eventually these beauracratic agencies do become aware of Lucy's situation and challenge Sam's ability to care for her.  Sam now must fight for Lucy as he never has had to do before.  Confused and heartbroken, Sam initially finds a high powered lawyer played by Michelle Pfeiffer.  But she wants no part of the case. Beset by a career which takes over her life, Michelle Pfeiffer's character has a sullen young son at home and little to say to her husband. Eventually, though, she does take the case, is almost shamed into it by other lawyers in her firm.  But in a remarkable twist of fate and and while helping Sam, she learns a great deal from him about parenting and unconditional love. What happens to Sam and Lucy as they are separated and the case is argued in court are memorable scenes filled with tremendous poignancy and deep emotions. For after all, who is truly fit to be a parent. Is love enough?  Who does make a good parent?  And most of all, what is in the best interest of Sam's daughter, Lucy
As an addition and complementing the tremendous perfomances of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer,Dianne Weist and Laura Dern Lucy played by Dakota Fanning, the movie inclues as background music many of the songs of the Beatles.  And at various times the screenplay includes relevant lines and quotes which are fitting to the scenes.  It was particualrly eerie watching this movie a few days after the death of George Harrison to hear Sam talk about the success of Harrison's song, ""Here Comes the Sun,"" from the Abbey Road album.  But what an appropriate comment I thought as the sun shined down on both Lucy and Sam as Sam ran around the soccer field with Lucy in his arms.
I cannot praise this movie enough.  While at times one couldn't help but think of the movies Rainman and Kramer vs. Kramer, I AM SAM stands on its own as being a truly wonderful movie.  I fully expect that Sean Penn will be nominated for many awards for his magnificent performance.  I certainly hope he is acknowledged for this, a performance of a lifetime. If not I am confident that viewers like myself will never forget Sean Penn as Sam or this finely drawn character.",1011484800,123,3881,4.4914772727272725
1712633,5,B000066HAS,"I was shown the film I am Sam in a class that i just finished down in LA.  First off, the soundtrack is a definite must buy, as many recording artists cover beatles songs in a very tasteful manner.  The film itself delivers high calibur performances from all of the leads and the supporting cast.  I would be very surprised if sean penn doesn't get an acadamy award nomination.  Michelle pfieffer was also very good in the film, as was laura dern.  This movie went straight for the heart and it was able to balance the serious moments with some light hearted moments.  The young actress who played lucy was amazing in the film as well.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a movie that will make you think.  Think about what it means to be a good parent, and about the strength and spirit of love and how it transcends any handicap that we are born with or that we inflict upon ourselves.  I can't say enough great things about this movie, so go see it!",1007769600,49,961,4.294444444444444

1712712,5,B000066HAS,"Even though this movie came out years ago, I think it is a very heart warming film. It is about a single, middle aged man with a mental disability that is trying to raise his daughter. The only problem is he has the mind of a 7-year-old and is in a way holding his daughter back educationally because she doesn't want to be smarter than her Dad.
This film uses a lot of high-key lighting because everything is supposed to be nice and peachy, but when he goes to trial the lighting is not necessarily low-key but more dim; you'll see a lot of blue and black. There are a lot of mid shots and close ups in this film to put emphasis on the characters emotions.
This movie is great and I'd recommend it to anyone! 5 stars!!",1481328000,,719,4.179856115107913

1712801,5,B000066HAS,"My husband bought this movie for me & gave it to me today. I could not wait to watch it as I had read all about it, so I watched it right away.

This story really touched deep in my heart and into my soul. I can't remember when I have seen a more touching movie--a real human interest story. Like some others on here, I did not realize that Sean Penn played Sam until the end--I didn't not recognize him because the part he played as an autistic with a child IQ was so real that I felt as if the part was being played by a real person with these disabilities. I have to agree with one of the reviewers who said that this movie topped ""Rain Man"" that was performed by Dustin Hoffman. Mr. Penn was even better than Mr. Hoffman and that is saying a lot. I think that everyone who got to know Sam benefited from knowing him. For a man with a low IQ, he had plenty of common sense and knew what was really important. The little girl, Lucy, also gave an outstanding performance. Michelle Pfeiffer also gave a good performance. Toward the end she was a lot more human than she was at the beginning of her part--she grew and matured.

I cried through out the story, especially toward the end when it looked as if all hope was gone. This is one movie that I will watch again and again. No bad language and no sex scenes in this movie--just great performances by good actors who did not need foul language or sex to tell a good story.",1460592000,,1424,4.137184115523466
1712802,4,B000066HAS,"I really love this movie.  The acting is very good.  I really liked the inclusion of people who have some mental challenges.  Their characters were best friends with Sean Penn's character and they actually made the movie that much more enjoyable for me.  I liked the mom who brought her son to all of the group activities and then gave them their space and waited for them to finish the activity.  What I didn't like about the movie was Michelle Pfeiffer's cursing.  It totally annoyed me and it was excessive.  It didn't need to be there.  If this isn't an issue for a viewer, then I highly recommend this movie.  Dakota Fanning did a terrific job for such a young girl.",1460160000,,671,4.479338842975206

1712881,5,B000066HAS,"I find it hard to believe that people are giving this movie one star, because of a shipping error, in which the DVD wasn't in the box, or that it didn't come with the original box. Folks, I think you're being asked to review the move I am Sam, not your shipping or DVD case experience. I wonder how many 5 star ratings the film got for showing up on time, and having great packaging, and an original case. Come on folks, get with it. Moving on, I remember thinking how amazing Penn's performance was, and that Denzel Washington was handed best actor this year, on a silver platter. The film industry in 2001, was being harshly critisized for a lack of black actors, and not having enough quality roles available for black actors. This was all over the media, and was a big blown out of the water mess. I saw Training Day, and if you watch both films and think that Denzel deserved best actor, you need your head examined.  Great film, great acting, and a treat to watch. I hope none of the negative reviews have an impact on here, this is one of the best performances by an actor I've seen in a long time. Enjoy!

1712905,5,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" (alluding to Dr. Seuss' ""Green Eggs & Ham"") is an extremely interesting film,  not so much for its content but for its openly manipulative style.  What comes across as contrived,  is actual subtle Expressionism.  Those criticizing the film for these elements are incorrectly viewing it as Realism - a contrasting style much more common to mainstream film.

Realistic films attempt to reproduce the surface of reality with a minimum of distortion. The illusion is that their film world is un-manipulated. But film Realism is simply less obtrusive manipulation, with the film's main interest what's being shown, the content, rather than the created effect, the form.  Because expressionism is the box office kiss-of-death,  to be commercially successful the style elements must be placed just below the surface of a realistic package.  It is probably the most difficult maneuver a director will ever have to make,  but ""I Am Sam"" nicely illustrates the payback when a director is able to pull it off.

Like their counterparts in the art world (note Lucy's expressionist paintings), Expressionist directors believe that psychological or spiritual truths can best be conveyed by distorting the surface of the material world. This reforming of reality can involve a high degree of open manipulation, and the emphasis is on the form rather than the content, at least as compared to Realism.  And (somewhat counterintuitively) the openingly manipulative Expressionism is actually less deceptive than Realism.

""I Am Sam"" is about the unqualified love between a man and his daughter,  almost a prequel to ""King of California"".  It is the ultimate feel good film,  largely because virtually every element of the production is in the service of evoking good feelings in viewers.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1446163200,,1827,5.180887372013652

1712938,5,B000066HAS,"This is a beautiful film which really demonstrates whey Sean Penn is a star. Sam is an autistic and mentally retarded man who has the intelligence level of a 7 year old. He grew up in an institution after his mother died. He now lives as much of a regular life as he can, in a small apartment with a job at Starbucks coffee. He has a few friends that are a constant in his life . These lovable characters include one who is very agreeing and sensitive, one who is very paranoid and negative and another who reminds us of Rainman. He also has a neighbor named Annie, played by Dianne Weist who is some sort of musical genius but has been living like a hermit or recluse the last twenty or so years. This cast of characters and his daily rhythm and routine make up Sam's life. The film begins with his boss saying 'it's time"" and Sam running to the hospital. A woman gives birth and the nurses give him the baby. A moment later, the Sam, still holding the baby, and the woman leave the hospital going towards the bus where the woman ditches Sam. Later we learn, she was a homeless woman who only wanted a place to sleep - and we understand that she never cared for Sam, only used him for a bed. Sam and the baby who he names Lucy Diamond, after Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds bond and he grows to become the very best father anyone can be. (Sam loves the Beatles and there are so many awesome references and clues to their songs and lyrics that part almost makes a movie within a movie!)

The older girl is played by Dakota Fanning and she does a magical job with her huge understanding eyes. She and her father have a love and a bond that is so beautiful to watch, it almost makes one question their own parenting commitments and sacrifices. But as Sam is the mental age of 7, his daughter begins to outgrow him in intelligence and they begin to feel some growing pains. It is a difficult adjustment which culminates in a birthday party where Sam pushes a little boy and a social worker appears and takes the girl. If anything, this movie shows how the social system can also fail miserably when it gets involved with well meaning do-gooders that jump to conclusions and make decisions that play with people's hearts and lives. Suddenly, Lucy is taken from Sam and his life drastically altered. His friends help him to find a high powered lawyer (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who he visits until, after her colleagues tease and taunt her that she'd never take a pro bono case, she finally accepts him as a client.

We quickly see that this high income, well respected, intelligent attorney has a life so screwed up that she should be the one with a social worker looking after her son, who both she and her husband all but ignore. Her high price clients are just like her, to the point of one couple telling her that neither of them want their child. This is the true heartbreak of the film and the crime in our current system is that people are measured by their net worth and not their human worth because by the end of the film, Sam and his huge heart becomes the hero because of just a few things he can give, patience, kindness, understanding, compassion and love.

A large part takes place is the courtroom, where Sam, who doesn't do well under pressure really begins to come apart until they finally assign poor Lucy to a foster home. This wonderfully bright and happy child, torn away from her loving father because of the system who thinks it knows best. Meanwhile, the foster home is really a Hollywood version of one with a caring Laura Dern playing the 'mother'. I highly doubt such a fairytale home exists - but maybe that is just from my own experience and what I've seen. Sam moves closer and takes a ""supplemental income"" job caring for neighborhood dogs to continue building what the court wants so he can win back Lucy.

The last half of the film shows more depth into the Michelle Pfeiffer character and some touching moments between Sam and Lucy which include her climbing out the window each night and walking to her father's apartment, carrying her books so she can read him bedtime stories. (Where is social services now as a little girl in a nightie walks alone in the middle of the night?) until the foster parents put bars on her windows. (Jail for the child because she wants to see her father, whom she loves!). Finally, in another Hollywood moment, the foster mom comes to the realization that the little girl loves and wants to be with her father and takes Lucy to Sam saying that she'll be on his side in court. His lawyer seems to be working her life into the right direction though if I'd change anything in this film it would be to show a bit more of the relationship between her and her son other than him being a silent prop for her character.

The movie has a happy ending with Sam getting Lucy back and a huge support network of friends (now including his lawyer and her son and the foster parents) to help him raise Lucy who clearly blossoms each and every time she is with her father who, as the entire films shows, loves her more than anything in the world.

An interesting comparison of what someone with lower mental capacity and material means has to offer, to what someone with every advantage has. In our roles as parent, friend or family member, much of what we tend to think is most important really isn't. Hopefully those who get to see this will be left with a new perspective on accepting others for what their strengths are, and less judgmental about their shortcomings since we all have lots of both, whoever we are.

I thought it was very well acted by everyone in the cast.",1430265600,,596,4.418181818181818

1712993,5,B000066HAS,"Parenthood is one of the hardest roles in any society, yet intellectually disabled Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) becomes a single parent to Lucy (Dakota Fanning) and with the support of friends and neighbours he makes a decent effort of it. However, social services become concerned with Sams parenting skills and the narrative mainly focuses on Sam losing custody of Lucy, and his extensive efforts to try to regain sole custody. Yuppie lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) at first gives Sam the cold shoulder, but over time she sees qualities in him that help her re-evaluate her own family dynamic. The plot contains many important and inspiring points to consider with regards to parenting, but at times it seems the system is too heavily stacked against Sam. Despite this Sam with the help of Rita and his friends find a way forward. For admirers of The Beatles the film soundtrack and plenty of dialogue will provide great delight as Sam is an avid fan. Overall the movie is one which conveys so many positive aspects of making good of a situation no matter what restrictions a person may have.

1713073,5,B000066HAS,"This has to be one of most touching movies I've seen of late.  Does a noble job of portraying a mentally challenged man (played by Penn) in a respectful and sensitive way, demonstrating the tenderness, love, simple values and overall good-heartedness of those who don't measure up to society's standards intellectually; it shows through him and his circle of friends that these people have much to contribute to and teach the rest of us.  When Sam becomes a father (it seems without really comprehending how that occurred), and the child's mother dumps the perfectly normal baby on him to care for, he takes his role to heart.  Sean Penn does a remarkable job acting this part.  Michele Pfeiffer is also believable as his high powered lawyer.  And his daughter, the bright and beautiful little Dakota Fanning, acts this beautifully, as well.  I think this ought to be required watching for anyone working with the ""handicapped.""  Beautiful movie, where true love wins out over the ""system,"" and justice is well served.

I was astonished that this irritating style of camera usage continued for the entire two hours. If you are prone to motion sickness, then you will have a tough time getting too far into this movie.

1713138,5,B000066HAS,"Normally I wouldn't be one to gush about the performance of Sean Penn.  However, his performance as Sam is honestly, near a masterpiece.  Working as I do in a high school, I have seen and identify many students I know.  Sean Penn must have spent a good amount of time learning what it is to be both autistic and developmentally delayed.  Kudos, Mr. Penn.

Beyond that, the story, while a sappy one, would hardly stand up to the light of day.  A man with the mind of a 7 year old raising a daughter with the help of other developmentally delayed friends just wouldn't fly.  It does, however, make for a great story.

I Am Sam is a learning tool for some people.  I have used it in my own classes to teach students that just because one might not be ""normal"" by society's terms, doesn't them useless or less than a person.",1398384000,,820,4.30718954248366
1713139,5,B000066HAS,"I Am Sam is easily one of the best films of the last 20 years. Unless you're watching with a critical eye (and let's face it, you can find something wrong with any movie if you try hard enough), this movie is superior in every way. The casting is top notch. The Beatles music and lyrics are smartly interwoven into the storyline. Rarely is there a movie where the soundrtrack lyric  is so essential to telling the story. Its a unique and original approach that supplements the incredible drama that unfolds on the screen. The film runs the gamut of emotions and never lets up. I Am Sam is definitely on of my ""go-to"" movies, just like The Sound of Music and other films that actually stir my emotions.",1398124800,,701,4.434108527131783

1713192,5,B000066HAS,"The way this film was made did throw me off a little at first. I was expecting a serious dramatic style of film making, but instead the picture takes a much different direction with cinematography that is as jolty, playfull, lively and giggly as the upbeat and often wacky styled soundtrack innermingled with various artists versions of classic Beatles songs. Yes I was sort of confused by this strange sort of style to the film, then it dawned on me. The film was setting the mood and style that reflected perhaps the inner child of the character Sean Penn plays who is emotionally challenged and has the mind of a 7 year old. After about half an hour the entire approach to making the film as they did felt uplifting and refreshing, even though the inner working of the story was a very sad situation where this emotionally challenged individual and his daughter want to be together but are forced by the legal system to be apart. That having been said, Sean Penn was incredibly authentic and moving in this role. Dakota Fanning as his daughter was simply brilliant as well, the tables switched here where Penn plays the child and Fanning the greatly adult-minded daughter. Throwing the ever so Great Michelle Pheiffer into the mix as an over worked and irritable Lawyer who slowly warms up to Penn's character and learns to slow down and smell the Latte, and you've got the perfect blend for a great film. I loved this movie over all.",1367884800,,1437,4.63921568627451

1713223,4,B000066HAS,"Aside from some rather artificial dialog with the Authorities, this is a marvelous and heart-warming film.

Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) got a homeless woman pregnant, who ran away from Sam and the baby on the way out of the hospital. She did not want to be a mother. Sam loves the idea of being a father, but he has the mind of a 7-year-old. He names the baby Lucy Diamond Dawson, after Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. And with some bemusement, he takes on the job of being a single father, while he works at Starbucks for minimum wage to support himself and his daughter.

But before long it is obvious that Lucy (Dakota Fanning) has grown smarter than her Dad (I did that, too, but it took me a little longer), even to the point of being afraid to learn things he doesn't know. In a touching scene where she is reading to him, she intentionally stumbles over a word he had stumbled over earlier when he attempted to read the book to her. She declares she does not want that book, and they go back to Green Eggs and Ham, which Sam can read. (In fact, it's the origin of the movie's title.)

Inevitably, they come to the attention of Child Protective Services, and Lucy is placed in foster care. They have two-hour supervised visits every other week, which is nowhere near enough for either Sam or Lucy. Enter attorney Rita Harrison Williams (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is shanghied into taking Sam's case pro bono.

One face you may recognize is Mr. Turner, the attorney for CPS, who is played to perfection by Richard Schiff. You will no doubt recognize him as the curmudgeon in the West Wing.

No real villains here, unless it is the system itself. Many charming touches, and one of the most adorable child actors you've seen in a long time. A winner.",1336780800,,1744,4.454545454545454

1713227,5,B000066HAS,"Oh My Goodness... I cried practically through this whole movie. I started crying at the beginning when Sam was being kind to a certain customer during his Job at Starbucks and telling the customer that he made a good drink choice. The reason I cried is because the customer didn't give him weird looks or call him names just because he's mentally challenged. That customer treated Sam like a friend. Ever since then, I couldn't help crying at the most touching parts of the film.

Anyways, just like my title for this review points out, even though Sam couldn't teach his daughter how to read big words or how to do really hard homework, he can still teach her about the most important things in life like how to love and show compassion, how to treat people, how to know the difference between the truth and a lie so that she won't ever lie, and he also teaches her how to be happy in a world where you see less and less happiness throughout your living life.

The first time I watched this was years ago when I was a teenager. I was watching it at my aunt, uncle & cousins' house. I didn't get to finish watching the whole thing because the living room kept getting noisy and I couldn't hear it very well. I watched it again today and practically bawled my eyes out. I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Even though Sean Penn was only acting, I hope he's that compassionate in real life.

Honestly, the first hour was a bit much for me. I nearly even turned it off after the first half hour because how annoying it was to hear the lead character. I understood he was mentally handicapped and I work with people like them all the time and love them...but I was getting a headache watching someone act like they were mentally handicapped. I don't know, maybe if I were closer to someone that is handicapped it would've been different. At that point the only thing getting me through was the sweet child Lucy.

But then especially around an hour and a half into the movie, it paid off. There were some incredibly powerful moments that were actually quite heartwarming. It's hard not to smile after watching the end.

You'll also have to believe that nobody called CPS out of concern for this child. Sam knew nothing about raising a baby. Nothing, not even how and when to feed the infant or how to change her diaper.

Jump to eight years later. The child is brilliant. She's a straight A student who suddenly starts doing poorly in school. Her grades fail dramatically. Why? She finally admits to papa, who struggles to read Dr. Seuss books, that she's ashamed to be smarter than her father. Gag me, please.

For reasons I won't state, Sam loses custody of his daughter. The State sees him as an unfit parent. After eight years? After he's supposedly raised a prodigy child from infancy all by himself? Sam retains the help of a lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer)to win his daughter back.

""I am Sam"" is just such a cliche of every single sappy, sad and otherwise melodramatically bad film that I've ever seen. It has the loving young girl in need of her father, the proverbial David and Goliath story that everyone has seen about a zillion times and that elusive man-child that believes that love conquers all. Who the hell writes these scripts and how they got Sean Penn (one of the greatest actors of my generation) to sign up for this overstuffed turkey will behoove the imagination. Sean does go out of his way to play the part to the hilt. He gives a good performance of Sam. But I don't think it's fair to blame him for the sub-par movie. Where were the writers and producers and the director? The story was so incredibly unrealistic that I sincerely doubt that even in a hundred years would the events in this movie ever take place anywhere in our universe. Because let's examine the story. Here's a man who does not have any basic skills to take care of himself and who has the capacity of a young child, yet he is now thrown into the realm of parenting his own child. And don't get me wrong, Sam was no worse and no better than any other parent. But does this happen in real life? As well all know, no, it doesn't. Where was Sam's family? Why didn't he have any support system to speak up? His daughter was born and the birth-mother literally ran away before they got home from the hospital. Then the scene picks up years later when Lucy was 7 or 8. How did Sam parent the child for the first several years of her life? It wasn't explained because it wasn't plausible. And what was up with that hideous music. John Lennon (may he rest in peace) would be turning in his grave to hear his classic music butchered like this. Michelle Pfeiffer was so annoying, not just because she was competely covered and caked in makeup that made her look like a walking Bamberger's cosmetics counter, but also because she was the typical movie cliche. Lawyers do not take cases ""pro bono"" as the movie called it unless they think they can get a piece of the action. And her character was just so sloppily written, one minute she's this hard-as-nails, takes no prisoners uptown lawyer and the next she's the vulnerable weirdo who has just as much emotional problems as Sam. It was just such a foolish movie that was somewhat insulting because the producers must have thought that there were people who would actually buy this cockamamie story. And I sincerely doubt that even Sam in all his esteem and intelligence would buy this self-serving, overindulgent ludicrous enactment.",1257724800,2,2785,4.484251968503937

1713248,5,B000066HAS,"So the movie sometimes tries hard to show us that this would be an ultimate tearjerker. The only thing is, it actually works. This film makes us care about Sam, a mentally-challenged man who takes care of his 7-year old daughter, Lucy. An abrupt separation might take place as social services try to persuade Sam that he cannot properly take care of his own daughter. That's the basic storyline. What follows are some truly believable performances from Sean Penn, Michelle Pheiffer, Dakota Fanning, and Richard Schiff. Penn seems to have the mental capacities of a 7-year old down perfectly; this has to be one of his finest performances. Pheiffer is also splendid as the lawyer who cooperates with Sam on the custody of Lucy. To tell you the truth, I didn't really mind Fanning as Lucy. She may be one of the most overrated child stars of all time, but here, she gives a wonderful performance as the young girl who never wants to hurt her dad's feelings. Schiff absolutely looks hateful in his role; you just want to punch him in the face for hours.

Again, this movie does look as if it desperately wants us to see how powerful this movie really is. But then again, it works. It's such a tender drama, that I can't help but love it.",1251936000,,1234,4.558558558558558
1713249,5,B000066HAS,"""I AM SAM"" ... Indeed! ... Sean Penn is a great actor. He definitely became SAM in this movie. It is undeniable that his performance as a loving father and single parent of a little girl who loves him with all her heart is incredibly moving. That Sam is mentally challenged is beside the point. The point being that he loves his daughter, Lucy, with all his heart as well and wants to be with her to raise her and enjoy her company, enjoying watching her grow up as all loving parents want to do with their children.

I watched this movie on DVD fives times in a row. I fell in love with it. The cast is outstanding and so believable. Sam, truly, has the best friends in the world, and his attorney, ""Lovely Rita"" - Michelle Pfeiffer - does an excellent job of helping Sam to keep his daughter. If you want to see a door kicked in by Michelle Pfeiffer that is as emotionally powerful as it is sexy, then watch this movie! You will never see a door kicked in so gloriously again. It's worth it just to see her doing that. True passion!

The music to this movie is Beatle-inspired. If you are a Beatles fan - like Sam and Lucy are - you will love this movie. If you are a fan of George Harrison, you will appreciate the line in the film when Rita says that he was always her favorite Beatle. If you know people who are mentally handicapped in any way, and realize what a challenge it is every day for all of them to function in this complex society, you will appreciate the sentiments of this movie. It is a wonderful expose into the world of the ""special people"" who share this life with us. You will come to love them for their uniqueness.

""It matters to ME!"" says SAM to his attorney, while standing before the counter to buy coffee. (By the way, notice that Sam figures out the exact amount of change in his head perfectly!) This is one of the most powerful lines in the movie. It is a great turning point in the way his attorney begins to relate to him - as a human being with deep wounds and real needs, and not just as another client or pro-bono trophy case!

The only question I have is, do Sam and Rita (his attorney) get together as romantic companions at the end of the film? I wonder.

Watch this great masterpiece of a movie and find yourself laughing and crying at the same time - and enjoy the music!

1713250,5,B000066HAS,"Perhaps, it was Dr. Seuss or The Beatles.  In any event, I really liked this overly sappy, yet endearing film from little known director Jessie Nelson.  Nelson paired up with many people on this film, including Edward Zwick, who played the part of producer.  Zwick, has directed many successful films including Glory and Blood Diamond.  Anyway, the research that Jessie Nelson, Sean Penn, and many others did while spending time at LA Goal in southern California, a center for the mentally challenged, helped this film achieve a very authentic tone.  Nelson interviewed one mentally challenged man who was raising a young daughter on his own and had learned to coordinate his daughter's feeding cycles by following a TV schedule.  The choice to cast real mentally challenged actors also helped the film achieve a certain genuineness.  Mentally challenged actors Joseph Rosenberg (Joe) and Brad Allen Silverman (Brad) were very real and persuasive as Sam's friends.  Regarding the film's soundtrack, most of the residents at the center told Nelson and her colleagues that their favorite music was that of The Beatles.  Consequently, we're left with a beautiful repertoire of Beatles covers by an impressive coterie of musicians, such as Sheryl Crow and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam.  In regards to Dr. Seuss, is there a child anywhere in America who didn't grow up hearing their parents read The Cat in the Hat or Green Eggs and Ham to them? The film really works because it shows us life as Sam and Lucy saw it; fun and hopeful.  Too bad most of us seem to lose that outlook as we progress in life and begin experiencing disappointments.

1713254,5,B000066HAS,"This movie was incredible, and never gets old.  Its interesting how Sean Penn had a more quality relationship with his daughter, despite the handicap.  He spent lots of time with her, and did his best to attend to her needs.  Michelle Pfeiffer, very educated, intelligent and very hardworking; yet not able to spend quality time with her son.  Should Child Protective Services remove her son away from the home, for ""daily child abandoment?"".  You be the judge.  I think the movie teaches us that no one has all of the answers.  But its pivotal that the question be explored.  This movie beautifully captured how parents, from different walks of life, learned from each other.  Sam taught Michelle patience and selflessness.  She began in the movie very impatient and with a low tolerance for ""Sam"".  As the movie progressed, she became more willing to put aside her needs and focus on those of her client.  Let's not forget he pushed and pushed her to get to this point.  She also began to see the value in focusing on her child's needs.  Michelle taught Sam about how to make a convincing argument on something that he cherished.  The methods he and his friends used to fight for his daughter's cause were very unique and odd, especiallly in a stuffy, "" old traditional courtroom"".  But her drive and ability to navigate the court/political culture challenged him to make a case for his daughter's cause.  They needed each other, essentially to help create a more quality relationship with their children.

And alas, finally there is Lucy, Dakota Fanning.  She is one of the most innovative, believable, BREATHTAKING actors of our time.  And she's pint-sized!  I'm amazed at how such an enormous talent came out of such a little bitty body.  Dakota has an extraordinary talent that will live with her the rest of her life.

1713256,5,B000066HAS,"""All I wanted was a place to sleep,"" those were the last words Rebecca, a homeless woman, said to Sam before leaving him with their newborn daughter, directly after birth.  I am Sam (2001) stars Sean Penn as Sam, a mentally handicapped father with the mental capasity of a seven year old, and Dakota Fanning, as Lucy, who has recently turned seven.  She started holding herself back to school to stop herself from becoming smarter than her father.  The question the movie asks is, can Sam raise his daughter despite his disability?
 And that is the question asked by the court after taking Lucy away from Sam on her seventh birthday. Throughout the trial the state is trying to prove that Sam is an unfit father, but the film shows how other families are dysfunctional, especially Sam's lawyer, Rita Harrison.  She learned a lot from Sam, the value of love and family.
 This film was not only a real tear-jerker but also included comic relief by Sam's close knit group of friends.  Dakota Fanning delivered an amazing performance, especially for a seven year old. She shows so much motion and it never feels fake or forced.  Her character is smart, mature, and deeply loves her father, and Fanning shows all of these qualities.
I am Sam is littered with Beatles references, from the soundtrack to the names of characters.  The soundtrack consists almost completely of Beatles remakes by various artists, which saves us from monotony.  Lucy and Rita both get their names from Beatles songs, ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and ""Lovely Rita"", and Rita's last name, Harrison, refers to Beatles guitarist George Harrison.  Also, when Lucy was a newborn, Sam pins her diaper with a Lennon pin, they walk across the street with balloons, resembling the cover of ""Abbey Road"" and well as many others.  Sam is a Beatles fan but when overwhelmed, he refers to Beatles facts.  For example, when Sam was being questioned in court he becomes frustrated and started speaking about why the Beatles broke up.
 It was well filmed and well-written.  The lighting set the tone for the film.  In scenes before Lucy was taken from Sam, it was bright, sunny and colorful.  Later, in the court room scenes, it was dark, gray and dismal.  The costumes also show this.  When Sam and Lucy are still together Lucy wears very bright clothing with patterns and even Sam's wardrobe is more colorful.  In court, everyone wears dark, gray clothing that seems to have harsher edges.  Dutch angle and a shaky, out of focus camera show us Sam's frustration and confusion.
I highly recommend this film.  The acting is amazing, the plot keeps one on the edge of one's seat and is full of emotion.  I am Sam leaves viewers hanging with an ambiguous ending and a dilemma.

1713258,5,B000066HAS,"Films about the developmentally disabled often border on ridiculous and demeaning. There are a few exceptions: Cuckoo's Nest & Rain Man immediately come to mind, and not to forget What's Eating Gilbert Grape (where Leonardo was nothing short of flawless). I Am Sam is such a film, with Sean Penn giving a thorough, heart-felt (and highly lauded) performance. There are issues, however, and the only time he really has to prove his 7-year old mentality is the perfectly uncomfortable temper tantrum he has at Bob's Big Boy. Michelle Pfeiffer is also excellent as a personally conflicted high-priced lawyer, who has enough problems of her own, while helping poor Sam. I won't blab away the plot, other than a disabled man is trying to retain custody of his daughter. There are so many wonderful performances in this film, including a cache of Sam's supportive cronies, also with various disabilities. Among these, Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile) finally has a role worthy of his talents, albeit it a minor role. I would like to see him more often. Wonderful supporting roles from Dianne Wiest, Richard Schiff, Loretta Devine and the always reliable Laura Dern are perfect. Most stunning is the intuitive, confident and complete performance of young Dakota Fanning (nominated by SAG). Children often see things that we ""grown-ups"" aren't in tune with; she's a smart, loving daughter who's all too aware that dad isn't ""normal"", and when her intelligence surpasses his, she is afraid; such a loving performance, and so natural. Director Jessie Nelson is all too aware of the sensitivity involved. The DVD extras are plentiful and insightful. This is truly a labor of love. Even at 2 hours, I was never bored. This controversial subject matter will always concern viewers regarding it's sensitivity level. In Ms. Nelson's hands, one must not worry about that. Well researched and well presented, I recommend ""I Am Sam"" to everyone who can appreciate a good story about a subject that many people choose to avoid.",1224374400,,2007,5.048192771084337
1713259,3,B000066HAS,"To say that `I am Sam' is not moving, stirring and heartbreaking would be a bold faced lie.  Truth be told, this movie made me bawl, and I am not ashamed to say that.  To say that this is an accurate depiction of the challenges of the mentally handicapped would also be a bold faced lie, for `I am Sam' is really a text book example of how Hollywood always tends to sink its sentimental claws into everything that is honest and pure.  Instead of delivering a plausible or even remotely relatable account, `I am Sam' borders on preposterous, at times jumping right over the fence and running full speed ahead at the forest of ridiculousness.

That said, I still cry every time.

Here we have the story of Sam Dawson, a mentally handicapped middle aged man who spends his days working at Starbucks and his evenings taking care of his daughter.  Yes, Sam has a child, who was bore to him by a homeless woman who left him moments after Lucy (named Lucy Diamond Dawson after the Beatles song) was born.  Sam has done a fine job raising Lucy with the help of friends and neighbors, but after a slew of misunderstandings raise concern over Sam's ability to remain a suitable parent, Lucy is removed from Sam's home and he finds himself struggling to fight for custody.

As many have noted both here on this site and critically when the film was released, the plot for this film is preposterous and even borders offensive at times.  It's depiction of the handicapped is rather one-note, and the entire eclipsed prose is rather unbelievable.

What does make sense is the stupendous acting.

Yes, what makes `I am Sam' worth a watch is the magnificent performances by the entire cast.  Sean Penn, an actor who is rather hit-or-miss with me, soars as Sam.  Yes, his performance can at times appear desperate (he does `overdo' it a tad) but it also comes off very genuine and sincere.  He suffers a bit because of the heavyhanded and often saccharine scripting, especially in the courtroom scenes, but he never loses the sincerity in his eyes.  Michelle Pfeiffer is also genuine and engaging as Rita, Sam's reluctant lawyer.  She is able to reach levels of understanding within her character that could have easily gone overlooked.

And then there is Dakota Fanning, totally snubbed of an Oscar nomination and brimming with brilliance as young Lucy.  Her heartfelt and utterly devastating portrayal of a young child in love with a father who she is being told in incapable of loving her is just dynamic to say the least.  She proves here beyond a shadow of a doubt that she has what it takes to become one of the biggest stars we'll ever see.

In the end I cannot say that `I am Sam' is a bad film, because I actually really like this movie.  But I can say that when taken apart and looked at on the films merit alone, it is really poorly constructed.  The script is filled with holes and improbabilities that reflect poorly on the overall impact the film is supposed to have.  But, the film is delivered in such a way that those inconsistencies are easily ignored.  The performances are so raw and invested that one fails to see the films many faults until later, when he or she has a chance to truly reflect on the film as a whole.  So, sit back and enjoy this beautiful story, just don't take it too seriously.",1224201600,,3301,4.544839255499154
1713260,2,B000066HAS,"This is the most shamelessly cloying movie I have yet seen. A man with the mental capacity of a 7-year-old can't possibly raise a child, period, end of subject. This would be an amazing enough story if only to show how such a man could take care of himself, living more or less independently. But not only is Sam able to take care of himself, working at a minimum wage job and living in a nice apartment, he is also able to raise a child and somehow afford all the expenses. Apparently there is a lot I could learn from Sam!

The child is the best and the worst part of the story. She is so cute, so sweet, so intelligent, so wise, so affectionate, and so loyal that any parents watching her will melt in the fantasy that their own normal kids could be half as good. In one courtroom scene a witness testifies that the girl is so smart not in spite of her father's shortcomings but because of his love and constancy. I suppose something can be said for always eating dinner at House of Pancakes and reading Green Eggs and Ham a hundred times each night.

The courtroom scenes were funny. Any witness expressing a concern for Sam's ability to be a competent, responsible parent was discredited for some secret and devastating failing in her personal life. In other words, if normal parents make mistakes, get confused, and mess up then who's to say that Sam, with the capacity of a 7-year-old, would do any worse? In fact he may do better.

Then there is the awkward scene when Sam's beautiful lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) puts a suit and tie on him and for a brief instant seems to feel enough attraction to consider a pro bono tryst. After all, her husband is cheating on her, so why not?

What I enjoyed most about the movie were the Beatles' songs performed by various cover artists. But it's a fantasy to think that to raise a child in Los Angeles ""all you need is love."" If a 7-year-old attempts to be a single dad it would be more like helter-skelter.",1221436800,12,1960,4.3911845730027546
1713261,5,B000066HAS,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""I am Sam"" (New Line Platinum Series) DVD (2002)

In looking at the other reviews for this film I was struck by two things: the amazing polarity of reviews; and the negativity of both those reading the reviews and many of those writing reviews.  Hence, I decided to rent the film first; but ordered it within minutes of watching it and was tempted to contact the reviewer that said, ""I guarantee you will end up not buying it, or asking for your rental fee back.""  For me, ""I Am Sam"" is entertainment (albeit not drama that many may have hoped for) at its very best.

At the outset I would like to make it clear that I think that Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, deserved a best supporting actress award.  Those who find her performance ""too good to be true"" need to watch the extras to learn more about her abilities and the experiences of her aunt that she brought to the role.  I will not enter the fray of Sean Penn's performance as Sam, beyond saying that I was able to get past the fact that it was Sean Penn; while Penn has had some good roles, I am no fan.  Michelle Pfeiffer is delightful, while Richard Schiff as the prosecutor--Mr. Turner--and Laura Dern as the foster mother--Randy Carpenter--provide depth to the usually ""villainous"" characterizations.  Are some lines and scenes over the top at times?  Yes; but they should be distracting only to those who are not truly watching the film.  Is ""I Am Sam"" realistic?  Yes and no.  But the film is a story based upon research, not a documentary; more importantly, it is believable--especially if you have spent any amount of time with disabled persons (as I have).

""I Am Sam"" is a marvelous film with, in my opinion, an illusive, subjective, almost quixotic imagery that entertains through multiple movie techniques.  Moreover--at the risk of ""asking"" for negative votes--I think the movie scares many viewers because it brings them into a world they feel uncomfortable viewing: to the point of focusing on conceived stereotypes and ""wanton"" product placement.  Conversely, I do feel that the subtitle--""All You Need Is Love""--injects an unfortunate theme that leads many to ""agree"" with Roger Ebert: ""The lesson ""I Am Sam"" wants to teach us is, ""All you need is love."" This is not quite strictly true. Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience.""

I would ardently argue that this is not the ""lesson""--or theme--of ""I Am Sam.""  For me, if there is a lesson (which I do not really believe there is one), it is that the line between normal and not normal is more illusive than we would like it to be.  More importantly, for me, is that the film really dares to deal with real life situations (parenting in particular), but in a cinematic fashion.  I am normally one that ""jumps"" on stereotypic, black and white, simplistic and politically correct portrayals.  Ironically, I find myself defending this approach as appropriately supportive of the photographic shooting style, editing, sound track, and musical score.  The movie is extremely well edited, that puts the viewer into the subjective perspectives of the characters.  And while some have complained that the movie uses non-Beatles versions of their songs, for which I empathize, the cost of using the actual songs would have doubled the costs.  Indeed, look at how many DVDs resort to replacing original songs used in the original showing with other versions (e.g., ""Northern Exposure"").

As for all the other films that other reviewers compare ""I Am Sam"" with, I must say that I do not feel that one can justifiably do so.  I truly feel that ""I Am Sam"" is a unique film, presented in a fairly unique fashion.  Perhaps it is the uniqueness that causes the polarization--a need to categorize ""I Am Sam"" into a ""type.""  But this is not ""Rain Man,"" or any other movie.  ""I Am Sam"" is its own movie: it questions the viability of a ""disabled"" (mentally challenged or not) person to be a parent--and just what is parenting?  The film is about being different, each person in their own way.  Is love important?  Yes, but not the solution; rather it is glue that binds people together.  And so, ""I Am Sam"" is also about friends and their important roles in our daily lives.

If you are looking for an upbeat or different film, I highly recommend that you venture along with ""I Am Sam"" for 134 minutes.  Some of you may cry or otherwise empathize.  I did not: I found myself feeling like a fly on the wall--a part of the film itself.  If you are looking for action, drama, or the ordinary I suggest you might look elsewhere.

Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks.",1217980800,6,5127,4.637873754152824

I Am Sam stars Sean Penn as a mentally challenged young man seeking custody of his daughter when it is obvious that he is not mentally capable of being a custodial parent.  He bases his plea on the Beatles song ""All you need is Love"".

1713275,2,B000066HAS,"""I am Sam"" is both repellent and fascinating. It took me an entire day to finish the film. I'd watch a few minutes 'til Sam did something so cringe-worthy I'd shut off the TV out of reflex, then be drawn back an hour later because I had to see what happened next, even though I was well aware I was watching dishonest, manipulative garbage. I guess I was fascinated by how pretty they were able to package it.

Sean Penn is often able to extract and convey the humanity in misunderstood, unpopular people, helping balance out the generally insensitive status quo; other times he's empathetic to a fault.

Unlike Dustin Hoffman's detached but strangely engaged portrayal of autistic Raymond in ""Rain Man,"" I was always aware of Penn steering Sam (who is described as retarded with autistic tendencies), manipulating him to match the film's theme of ""All you need is love."" The theme is a nice sentiment, but pragmatically irresponsible given the subject matter.

Penn's Sam Dawson isn't as irresponsible as Penn's Sam Bicke in the semi-true, ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon,"" which had Penn as a humiliated, desperate everyman, leaving out important history about the real Bicke (Byck) that drove him to the assassination attempt. (Without knowing this it's a far more compelling performance.)

""I am Sam"" does a big disservice omitting important information about the circumstances that led to Sam Dawson making a baby.

The film starts with close-ups of Sam obsessively organizing sweeteners and cups at Starbucks, complimenting people on their coffee choices. His boss George tells him it's time for him to go. Sam gets excited and runs over to the hospital where a woman is giving birth. A nurse asks him, ""You the one responsible for this?"" And Sam says he's sorry.

Afterward, the mother abandons Sam and the newborn, saying ""I just needed a place to sleep."" I guess you could infer it was the mother's idea to make the baby, which could be supported by a scene later in the film where Sam is in a food court conversing with a woman, oblivious he's being propositioned -- but this wasn't enough to ease my concern.

For seven years, Sam is able to take care of his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") without too many problems. He named her after the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" because he's a big Beatles fan. Their music plays a prominent part in the film, with the soundtrack primarily comprised of contemporary artists (Eddie Vedder, Sheryl Crow, The Black Crowes to name a few) covering their songs.

Sam has a few fellow mentally challenged friends who help him with Lucy. He also has Annie (Diane Wiest) as Lucy's godmother, an agoraphobic neighbor who helps answer Sam's many child rearing questions, which include giving him a feeding schedule based on Nikelodeon's TV schedule:

Starting with ""'Hogan's Heroes' Then again, wait until ""I Dream of Jeanie,' and then `I Love Lucy.'""

His friends' main activities are going to IHOP and ""Video Night."" One of them is obsessed with Victor Flemming, another guy is paranoid, and another one really wants to see ""Kramer vs. Kramer.""

One night, Lucy wants to go to Big Boy instead of IHOP. Sam throws a fit when the waitress tells him they don't have French pancakes. ""Ask Bob! Bob's Big Boy! Because the customer is always right! The customer is always right! The customer is always right!"" Lucy is embarrassed.

Cut to a scene of Sam dressed up as a young Beatle, flailing his arms to the Wallflowers cover of ""I'm Looking Through You"" with an embarrassed Lucy and her schoolmates during a Halloween party.

Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") is taken from Sam during a birthday party by a social worker (Loretta Devine from TV's ""Boston Public"") after Sam is determined to have the IQ of a seven year old. The social workers are concerned Sam won't have the ability to take care of Lucy when she gets older.

Sam finds a fancy lawyer named Rita (Michelle Pfeifer, who is still quite the Ladyhawke) and stalks her and manages to quote both ""Lovely Rita"" and ""Michelle"" to her. Rita ignores him until some of her colleagues mock her when she says she has considered doing pro bono work before.

The concern about Sam's baby-making is brought up once: while questioning neighbor Annie, the prosecution asks her about Sam's competency when puberty comes. Annie says he would have as much difficulty as any other father - she's lived a long life and has observed all kinds of fathers. The prosecution then asks her: What about your father? The camera does one of those dolly/zooms like when the boy on the raft got eaten in ""Jaws,"" and Annie quietly leaves the room.

Then Sam defends himself by quoting a courtroom scene from ""Kramer vs Kramer"" and loses the case.

But Rita convinces him to keep going.

As you've probably already noticed, the film has a strong supporting cast, which also includes Mary Steenburgen and Brent Spiner (Data from TV's ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" and cruise director Godwyn in ""Out to Sea"") in a brief appearance as a shoe salesman.

Laura Dern (""Rambling Rose"") plays Randy Carpenter, Lucy's protective foster mother. She has a change of heart when Lucy won't stop sneaking out and visiting Sam. She agrees to be on Sam's side in court, and the film ends with the kids playing soccer and Sam giving Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") a big hug after she scores with Aimee Mann and Michael Penn's cover of ""Two of Us"" on the soundtrack.

I guess I just wanted more interaction between lawyer Rita and Turner, the prosecutor. As it is, ""I am Sam"" feels as if the filmmakers cheated the ending and tried to blind the audience with shmaltz.

Which brings me to the cinematography. Elliot Davis uses small zooms and jerks to emphasize every emotion, as if with every movement he's saying, ""Feel this, because I know you can't without me!"" Calm down, Elliot.

The DVD features audio commentary, a documentary ""Becoming Sam,"" which wasn't as insightful as I'd hoped it would be, deleted/alternate scenes, which I didn't bother watching, and some cool folding/unfolding origami menus, which were probably my favorite thing about the whole disc.

The soundtrack is better than the movie. I suspect people will probably buy more of it than the ""Hounddog"" soundtrack. Personally, I'm waiting for the ""Do the Right Thing"" CD reissue, featuring Radio Raheem's ""Fight the Power"" m-m-m-mash-up with ""Fairytale of New York"" and ""Close to You,"" topped with Bosco.",1174608000,2,6461,4.858962693357598
1713276,5,B000066HAS,"I Am Sam is one of, if not the best, motion picture of all time.

I Am Sam is about a retarded man named Sam (Sean Penn) who has a mental capacity of a 7-year old. He works as a server at Starbucks, is obsessed with The Beatles, and loves IHOP. After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him, and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together, Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears, laughs, and the overwhelming power of human spirit.

This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film. Sean Penn is top of his game and gives an amazingly realistic performance as a disabled man without a single flaw. To this day it makes me furious he didn't win the Oscar. Dakota Fanning's premiere role is by far her greatest ever, and at only six years old opened the eyes of actresses who've been in the business for years and basically screamed into their faces ""This is how acting is done."" And Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a phenomenal, incredibly realistic performance that will absolutely take your breath away.

As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.

Sean Penn might be mentally challenged (he has the IQ of a 7 year old) but when it comes to emotional intelligence he has so much to give to his daughter and to everyone around him. What a stark contrast this is to his super intelligent lawyer who is emotionally cut off from everybody around her. The moment when he holds his newly born daughter in his arms and the whole world is turning it depicts so well the joy that he feels, a joy that all parents have felt (for some it seems that the world stops). He is an example to follow when you see him spending time with his daughter, reading books with her, singing, just been there for her. How many ""normal"" parents forget to do this very thing...

Sean Penn gives an astonishing performance. Some of the moves he makes, the way he walks and some facial expressions he employs, they make you forget that he is acting (I think the fact that his eyes are relatively small compared with the rest of his face helps). Before shooting the movie he spent time with some people with special abilities and this seems to pay off during the movie.

The soundtrack is superb. Beatles' classic songs are rendered in a fresh way from various artists. Just listening to ""Across the universe"" performed by Rufus Wainwright is a good enough reason to buy the cd. Choosing Beatles song is not a mere coinsidence since this group seems to be the favourite of people with special mental abilities.

I would highly recommend this movie. Not just for some good laughs not just for some tears but most of all for an honest look in us, of how much of our emotional abilities we use in our every day life in connection with others but especially in connection with our kids.",1161734400,,1774,4.469135802469136

This is a veritable tour de force for him.  But not to be upstaged is Dakota Fanning, who plays opposite of Penn and is named Lucy Diamond after the hit Beatles song.  Sean Penn's character has to fight for custody of Lucy, and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, for free.  She helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor.  All in all, a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness.

1713289,5,B000066HAS,"I did cry during this film.  There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was.  I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily.  I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it.  I am here to say that I was wrong.  For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film.  Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing.  I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a clich Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest.  Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters.  While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully.  Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career.  Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented.  I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.

On the apparent level, I Am Sam works because of Sean Penn.  As I watch more and more of this actor's body of work, I cannot help but be continually impressed.  Penn brings more to the screen than any other actor could imagine.  His presence, in my eyes, dwarfs Hanks and Cruise phenomenon.  Penn is constantly surprising us with challenging roles that fluctuate between light and dark.  He is not focused on one genre, but always impressing with his ability to move between films.  One will never quite know what he has in his back pocket until we see him on screen.  He is that impressive.  I believe that it was also the aid of Dakota Fanning which gave Penn the strength to be the character that he was.  For her first feature film, Fanning came out with the prose and professionalism that has nearly gone missing in Hollywood.  She stood up, worked with Penn like they had been companions for a lifetime, and succeeded in giving us the emotion this film desperately deserved.  She was an element of I Am Sam that was needed to bring a human element to Sam, and she did it with the greatest of ease.  I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern.  They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film.  Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer.  I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the clich walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast.  There was a level of annoyance with her as well.  The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me.  I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better.  She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work.  Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar.  I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.

There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them.  The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film.  The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film.  This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning.  This is much different than your typical courtroom film.  I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film.  Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for.  I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema.  Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.

Overall, I thought this was a surprising film.  I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie.  I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play.  I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel.  One should watch this for more than just the acting, the music and cinematography add a level of professionalism and creativity to overall themes.  Again, I cannot state it enough, I was not expecting this film at all.  What the box indicated and what the final result really was, two completely different ideas.  The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film.  I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing.  I think you will be just as surprised/shocked as I was!!

1713290,4,B000066HAS,"Not to far back I made a statement that I felt Sean Penn's performance in this film made him appear desperate.  After watching this film yet again I have to reconsider my approach for it's less desperate and more over-enthusiastic.  Who can blame an actor whose well loved and adored by fans as well as the academy for going a little overboard when given the opportunity to chomp on some real Oscar bait.  The only problem here is that Sean goes a little too far over the top and it just gets to be too much (ONLY at times...I don't want to leave the impression that the entire film is full of overacting...it's not!)

That said, `I am Sam' as a whole is one of the most moving films to come out in 2001 and it still feels warm when watching, and despite the minor over-acting I am still brought to tears every time I see Sam (Penn) interacting with his daughter Lucy (Fanning).  The story of Sam, a mentally handicapped man working at Starbucks and supporting his illegitimate daughter (born to him by a homeless woman who after the delivery split from the scene leaving Sam to fend for himself), is as touching and moving as it is inspiring, and to an extent maybe the overacting on Penn's part adds to the emotional response we give when overlooking his predicament.

After the state seizes his daughter claiming him unfit to care for her he convinces high profile lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him.  As she builds her case she finds it difficult to win only because she can't seem to find a good character witness, although we all know the greatest witness is Lucy who undoubtingly loves her father very much.  The weight of this movie lands on the shoulders of young Dakota Fanning who I wholeheartedly believe was unjustly snubbed an Oscar nomination for her role as Lucy Diamond Dawson.  This young lady has more talent in her pinky finger than most actresses who've been in the business for years and is more controlled in her delivery than both Penn and Pfeiffer.  She is utterly and completely believable.

Speaking of Little Miss Fanning, my wife and I were discussing this young up and comer and she was saying that maybe there's too much maturity in her eyes, that maybe this is all she is able to do, these mature roles.  My wife although has not seen last years `War of the Worlds' where Fanning played the perfect little girl, filled with innocent curiosity and complete immaturity.  I really feel that in the years to come this young girl will be quite the film icon.

Back to the movie...

I really must say that this movie touched me and moved me in ways that only these types of films can.  What can I say, I'm such a stickler for sad movies about people rising up against the odds (I tell you, `I am Sam', `Of Mice and Men' and `Awakenings', all dealing with the mentally handicapped, are the three main films that bring me to tears EVERYTIME).  I'd recommend this movie to anyone with the opportunity to see it, and while I have made mention to my feelings that Penn overacted a little too much, it really doesn't tear away from the message this movie carries nor the emotional weight you will feel by the time the credits begin to roll.",1158278400,,3183,4.517421602787456
1713291,5,B000066HAS,"Critics say it isn't ""realistic"". Umm, it's a drama (i.e reality with a flair).  Hence, the derivative - ""dramatic"". If you want realism, visit the family law department at your neighborhood courthouse. Notwithstanding the drama, the legal process was substantially realistic to the extent it touched on the various phases. The plot was tightly drawn. Delivery was compelling and very entertaining. Excellent acting from ALL actors, brilliant scriptwork (especially good for Penn's role), gelled in a near PERFECT blend of production, camera,video work and music (for those '60 and '70 era kids, and to all the knowing and appreciative, the Beatles theme and on-spot songs gave this film sanctimonious flight. ALL the actors were at or close to the top of their game. A fluid, albeit slightly lengthy, masterpiece of acting and production. Sean Penn as Sam, a mentally handicapped single father, struggles with the system over legal issues pursuant to his capacity to properly raise his young daughter. The excruciating degree of physical and mental demands inherent in the successful execution of this role of Sam, as played so near-perfectly by Penn, cannot be overstated. Penn's acting in this role further substantiates his genius for consistent excellent acting and glues him toe to toe with Cruise and Hanks. Penn is to be lauded for a remarkable acheivement in bringing Sam to optimal life. Michelle Pfieffer was exciting, perpetually combustible and really fun to watch. Dakota Fanning was brilliant. ALL the actors, including the second and third support tiers, had relative depth of character calibrated and cured to perfection. Somewhere in the background there is a wonderful stage - prop -  crew at the helm - superb professionals who know their stuff. All flaws remain strictly subjective, have mostly to do with an occasional illogical snafu (such as the supposedly 'perfectly responsible foster parents' permitting Lucy the wherewithall to sneak out of the house (again?) after she's caught wandering the streets to her father's house, and upon discovering this unnverving fact the parents display insufficient shock. Other minor quirks were to be found such as slight disruptions in the intellectual continuity of Penn's charcter revealed by some illogical upshifts in intellectual overage, such as Penn's eyes are too normal, calm and intelligent (noticeably out of character) when Pffifer breaks the door down in a huff and finds him serene behind his cutouts (breaking the door down should have triggered a little rapid eye movement) and a few more spurts of slight intellectual overage is mainly due to script and Penn reverting back to himself mid-scene for several quick but noticeable seconds.  Also it could be argued that Lucy's maturity in later scenes pushed slightly ahead of her years, unless she was endowed with abnormally superior intellect which could have very well been the case.  As such, these are all trifling criticisms and they make little stew for studious topic. This is an intense emotional feel good movie, not a dusty documentary - lovingly steeped in a rich movie flair.",1155340800,,3117,5.240480961923848

Another point worth noting is the commendable effort the actors and actresses in this movie put on. But of course, Sean Penn deserves most of this praise because it is not easy to play a mentally retarded character with such conviction.

But neither can save the script from its pitfalls, namely, an unrealistic portrayal of a grown man with the mind of a seven year old.  None of the characters come of seeming like real people so much as types. Even his daughter (the annoying Fanning) is more HOllywood precociousness about her than real-life childlike qualities. More time seems to have been spent on product placement that developing the story and characters.  The saving grace is the slight ambiguity of the ending; I thought for sure they'd settle for the cheap, easy ending just as they settled for the cheap and easy everywhere else in the film.",1142553600,2,885,4.866666666666666

I DO love it for all it's intentions, for the message it's trying to convey...even if along the way that message gets somewhat eschewed amongst the sentimentality of everything.

Because of the powerful, emotional scenes people are quick to dismiss this movie; call it unrealistic, over the top...lots of things. They neglect to appreciate the performances, the general message.

Sean Penn and Michelle Pheifer are extraordinary together here.  I love the way the film was done in terms of countering Sam's disabilities- the sometimes shaky camera angles, the occasional ticking background noise/music, it seemed to all correlate with his natural disposition and how he must have felt in this situation.  They do a good job expressing that being a new parent isn't exactly easy for anyone, let alone someone in Sam's position.

Watch this movie for the chemistry between Sean Penn and Michelle Pheifer, don't necessarily expect to be enlightened.  Yes it's sentimental, but is that such a horrible thing for a movie to be these days?

There are some seriously heart wrenching scenes in this movie: particularly the one where Sam locks himself up in his apartment, depressed about the possibility of losing his daughter, and Michelle Pheifer comes to talk to him.  This scene is so well done, so raw and compassionate and deeply personal.  Sam breaks down and essentially lashes out @ Rita, in turn making her break down.  As far as the cinema goes, it's definitely one of the most memorable scenes in a while.  It takes you out of the actual realm of the story at hand and presents everyday real life issues between everyday people.  It's so powerful when Sam says ""People like you don't know what it's like... People like you don't feel things""  and Rita responds with ""People like me feel small and unimportant and disposable""  (not exactly positive as far as the word for word w/ Ritas part, but you get the idea)

This is definitely worth at least one viewing.  Great movie.",1142380800,,2130,4.8076923076923075
1713297,2,B000066HAS,"I have to admit, this film had a touching idea and concept. But just like nearly every Hollywood film that tries to depict the life of the mentally challenged, the plot is highly unrealistic and predictable, overly sentimental, and relys too much on the whole ""all you need is love"" theme to make the audience believe that Sam is a responsible father, even though in reality he's not. Not to mention that some of the situations are just either ludicrous and so, well, Hollywood that the film loses its charm and sense of reality that it COULD have had.

For one, yes, Sam is a wonderful father that really loves his daughter. But if he's as mentally challenged as the show tries to depict, then how was he able to afford a very nice apartment with a minimum wage job at Starbucks? Why did it take 7 years for the law to realize that Sam has the intelligence of a 7 year old? Why does he sometimes use big words on occassions, and at the end of the film suddenly comes out with an eloquent speech? And how many times does this film have to be reminded that Sam is mentally ill?

Another flaw in this film was how forced it felt. For one, it's a no brainer that love is a great thing and that it can overcome many obstacles, but Hollywood seems to take it too literally. The only thing that people say to defend Sam's fatherhood is that ""he loves his daughter."" But yet everybody fails to realize that Sam, as wonderful a father he is, can't afford all the things that Lucy needs, and that he's literally a 7 year old in a grown man's body. Even when records show that he has autistic tendencies and mental retardation, all that Sam's lawyer (or Michelle Pfeiffer) can come up with is ""all those things don't undermine one's compacity to love."" I am sorry, but that's a bunch of BS. This film tries so badly to convince us that Sam is a good father that it starts to look ridiculous and downright irresponsible. Let's get real here, there's more to being a parent then simply being able to love your child. If one doesn't have the mental compacity to raise a child, then it's best that the child should be put into a better household. I think most sensible people can agree with that in the real world. This film is just a bunch of sentimental Hollywood fluff. Esp. the part when Michelle Pfieffer's character goes through a mental breakdown about all the trials and tribulations of her life. Was that supposed to make us feel more sorry for her than for Sam? Um, not quite, it was laughable. We know that nobody is perfect, but gimme a break, the scene was completely unnecessary and ridiculous.

At the end, I was left disappointed. As somebody who has been raised around the mentally ill, there's absolutely nothing in this film that depicts reality. Absolutely nothing. And that's a shame, because i really felt that it had lots of potential. Hollywood should learn that if they are going to build a film around real life issues and people, they should at least be considerate to the sensitive reality of it that some people have actually experienced. The only plus side of this film was the acting from Dakota Fanning---even though I think this girl acts way too intelligent for me to believe that she's a 7-year old--- and Sean Pean. And I have to say this, Michelle Pfieffer is the most ANNOYING and overly dramatic actress I have ever seen on screen. Call me ""retarted"" for not raving about this film, but I am just expressing my opinion. It's not a bad movie, but it was way too sentimental and over-the-top with the ""all you need is love"" theme for it to be the least bit realistic and believable.",1132963200,6,3605,4.467374810318665

Sam is a man with a mental disability and therefore, has the mental capacity of a 7 year old. He has a 6 year old daughter Lucy and lives with the help of his neighbors.

Well I guess I'm with the former I'm willing to ignore the obvious flaws (most notably the screenplay who didn't do justice to the performances of the actors) because of the amount of heart the film has.

The performances were very good particularly Penn and Fanning. Penn never missed a beat, It could've looked overblown and a freak show but he made it really compelling and sensitive. Fanning is probably one of the few young actors who exhibited such great depth as an actress that even actors twice or thrice her age could only imagine. Made you wonder where the hell she's getting all this emotions. Pfeiffer though good is I guess the most obvious casualty of the weakness of the script. Her character started from being a total bitch to a sympathetic compassionate character without any subtlety. It wasn't developed enough. In one key scene where she had a breakdown, she seemed more like a complaining brat instead of really having a breakdown and a little tear could've helped the scene a little bit. The script really hindered Pfeiffer to just nail this part because there's no doubt she's one of the best actresses around.

It's a good film to watch in a cold night, the ending might be a little overblown and mushy but I guess ultimately a satisfying closure. You'll have a smile on your face after you watched it.

I was just starting a nasty custody case when I saw this movie for the first time and I was moved in so many ways. I could watch this movie over and over again, the music (all Beatles covers) was done perfectly, and Penn's performance was done so well he had a certain innocence about him that was just heart wrenching at times because of how bad he was being treated by the system and he just kept doing what he thought was right and the one point in the movie when he was on the stand and sounded like he was making perfect sense and it ended up he was just quoting something he heard from someone else saying(other people's names included),it really makes you feel for him and you just wish that they would give him his daughter back.

The love that the entire cast and crew put into the project radiates from the scene and generates enough goodwill to forgive the occasionally languid pacing.
Sean Penn's nomination was absolutely well-deserved, and Dakota Fleming does a great job of Sam's daughter. Some magnificent supporting turns by Laura Dern, Diane Wiest, Stanley DeSantis, and two actually mentally handicapped actors, help carry the somewhat airy/sappy script through some of its less credible moments.

1713314,5,B000066HAS,"Sean Penn delivers a terrific performance as an autistic father who tries to bring up his daughter. Eventually the social workers found out about him through the teacher at the school his daughter attends, and they try to take away his daughter and put her into foster care because they think he isn't mentally capable of raising a child. Due to the unusual circumstances that ensue partly due to Sean Penn's persistent efforts at getting the best lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to help him regain custody of his daughter, Michelle decides to help him out and in the process develops a meaningful friendship with Sean.
This movie really tries to do a few things. It shows us the negative attitude that society has towards people with mental illness. Does having a high IQ mean one is more than capable of being a better parent than another person with a low IQ (or a mental illness)? We're not talking about people with psychotic/violent mental illnesses here. The movie tries to tell us is that love is very important. We live in a world which can be so heartless sometimes, so impersonal and so distant. A lot of us get caught up in the games and the rat races, and we even start to believe that this is really what the world is about - money, status, power. Every now and then, we are lucky enough to witness a small gesture of care and love to remind us that there is more to life than just the work and the money. In this movie though, you'll find LOADS of scenes which convey true love and care - not the kind of erotic, passionate love between lovers, but the kind of warmth and empathy and goodwill that lights up the grey in our skies.
Michelle Pfeiffer put in a great performance as well, and so did Dakota Fanning as Sean Penn's daughter in the film. I like Laura Dern's performance too. Just so many things I like about this movie - the music, the artwork, the acting... A pity, I think, that this movie will probably not move the hearts of those who are into bloody violence and gore that is so predominant in Hollywood movies today. This is a drama film - the emotions that the actors convey, its all about paying attention to the words and the meaning in each scene...

1713315,5,B000066HAS,"This film is phenomenal.  Let me tell you why, in the best way I know how:
 **Personal Preface:  My brother Christopher has autism.  He was diagnosed with autism when he was four, and is now twenty-four.  In age, he is my older brother; in mentality I have been his older brother since I was 5.
  Growing up with Christopher has taught me many things about life-perspective and how some people see many things differently.  I am deeply saddened by the other reviews here slandering the film on the grounds that ""it takes much more than love to get a girl through adolescence, and anything else in life.""
  The Greeks labeled three kinds of love, Eros: passionate or sensual love, Phileao: love shared between close friends and family, and Agape: A transcendent, selfless love that neither wavers nor grows dim.  Unfortunately some people have never experienced all three of these types of love, nor do they know how to measure their efficacy.
  To my brother Christopher, all he does need is love, and literally as a high functioning person with autism, all he gives is love.  It's all he knows.  He loves life, cheeseburgers, music, church: simple things.
  As a certified assistant psychotherapist for the Lovaas firm of autism research, I also know that love, even as the popular definition as our culture knows it, is the most effective tool in helping both children and those with autism develop as functional human beings.
  My mother works with the career resource exchange in Colorado Springs.  In her case load has more than 30 different people with mental disabilities that she helps on a bi-weekly basis.  Even having an autistic child, she did not recognize Sean Penn until the movie was over.  Here's the kicker, Sean Penn is her favorite actor.  That is what kind of performance he gives.
  To both Roger Ebert, and the individual that quoted him: Ebert, everyone knew you as the bitter weird tub next to Siskel, grow up, and figure out that nobody like your pious pretension and aesthetic retardation.  In response to the pessimistic young man who quoted R.E. Mystery Log: befriend someone with downs, or Aspurgers, and figure out how their minds work, how their hearts talk, and then critique movies that you know nothing about.
  ***Movie Review:  Honestly Sean Penn's performance eclipses Dustin Hoffman's in Rain man, both for believability and accuracy.  You know how the Academy Awards operate; he was being rewarded for this performance this year.  Sean Penn's performance is nothing short of a cinematic miracle of epic proportions.  His behaviorisms, tics, antics, voice inflection, deliveries, the list just goes on and on.
  Two of the four actors that played his friends actually had the disabilities they were portraying, making authenticity something not to be questioned.
  The film raises a series on controversial questions about guardianship and family; the most controversial here being how certain demanding vocations can corrode your life, and your relationship with your family.  Michelle Pfeifer does an incredible job portraying the overworked mother, whose stresses at a six figure job causes dilapidations in her home life as well as work relations.
  The other amount of controversy can be attributed to the antagonizing of the state's District Attorney.  In most cases the state does do its job of properly assessing the abilities of caretakers of those mentally disabled, but there have been many cases where the state was incapable of demonstrating these abilities.  By no means does this movie mean to prove that this is unequivocally the lot of the courthouse, but it does illuminate infractions that are not unheard of in the courtroom.
  This film has made me cry every time I see it.  I have seen it about eight times.  I don't cry because I am sad, or because I am over emotional, or because I am happy that small voices are being heard, I cry because I see the characters going through the same struggles I go through in my life, and overcome them with love and things we often forget.  This film is in my top 25 incredible movies list.  Five stars, highest recommendations.",1085961600,73,4126,4.930232558139535
1713316,5,B000066HAS,"With the exception of a few bad words, this movie was a good teaching vehicle for my nine year-old son Ryan who has a severely autistic seven year-old brother. It showed the acceptance that is possible with mentally retarded(pardon the outdated term) individuals.  It also showed how society often completely misinterprets the behavior of special people, like my son.
Beatle's soundtrack wonderfully done, the whole movie was a very moving stream of consciousness.  How could a person not have more respect for the acting of Sean Penn after this one?? Even though Sean is in a lot of ""tough guy movies,"" he is to be praised for this one! I hope he attempts more ambitious roles...I would love to see him portray an autistic man, or maybe appear as Charley Gordon in a re-make of ""Flowers for Algernon.""

Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience."" - Roger Ebert

  I like Roger Ebert, he is one of the few film critics I  see eye-to-eye with most of the time. (Though you wouldn't know it from my review of ""I Hated, Hated, Hated this movie"") The thing I admire most about Ebert is the clarity of his writing. He succinctly summarizes the chief complaint among the critical community about ""I Am Sam"" (see above) Ebert et. al would be correct if we conceded that this was the point of the film. I'm only 20 years old, I have no children, and even I know it takes a lot more than love to provide for a child. No one in their right mind would be completely on Sam's side, and ultimately, neither is the movie!!! This becomes abundantly clear if you WATCH IT TO THE END. If it had ended any other way it would be a profoundly stupid film.
  Contrary to popular belief, ""All you need is Love"" is not the message of ""i am sam."" In fact I believe that the film could have saved itself a lot of scorn if it hadn't made that phrase its tagline.
  Instead, ""i am sam"" teaches its audience that a family that has everything, yet is devoid of love is just as doomed as a family that has nothing else.",1084233600,2,1517,4.15358361774744

Also, I'm deeply disappointed in Michelle Pfeiffer. Her performance was as hokey as the script and definitely is sub-par.
This having been said, I'll play the part of the optimist and point out some good things. Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning deliver  great performances. Their chemistry on the screen is absolutely amazing. They turn this movie from a 0- to 1-star film to a 2- to 2 1/2-star film.

However, it gave this movie a pedestal for Sean Penn to display his acting talent.  It's timely that he's been given an Oscar for his portrayal of a tormented father in ""Mystic River"".  He's arguably one of the best but under-rated actors of all time.  He's so versatile & when he's on-screen, I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  In this instance, he portrayed an autistic & retarded father (IQ of a seven years old) to an extremely bright daughter.  He sought help from an over-the-top lawyer (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) to win his daughter back from the system as Social Welfare believed that the daughter needs a balanced environment for her growth.  Despite that Sean's character provided her with a lot of loving, her growth is stifled somewhat for her relucance to be ""better"" than her dad.  Sean's mannerism, body language, speech is truly believable.  The DVD came with many deleted scenes where we get to see more acting talents (particularly his improvisation) of Sean Penn.  Moreover, we have an in-depth look at the research, casting, production, direction, et cetera.  This movie is rather heart-warming.  Some people reckoned this movie could be over the top or cheesy but truth to be told, it's a rather remarkable family movie.

1713326,4,B000066HAS,"How you end up feeling about ""I Am Sam"" is going to come down to which wins out, your heart or your head, because those two parts are not going to agree.  In this 2001 film from director Jessie Nelson a mentally retarded man, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) has to fight for custody of his bright 7-year-old daughter, Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning), with help from a cold-hearted lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer).  The state of California, represented by Richard Schiff as Turner, is concerned because Lucy is now smarter than her father and needs smarter parents (this seems a dangerous precedent to me, but you know what California law is like).
This film knows how to manipulate the heartstrings big time, starting when young Lucy asks her daddy why he is different from the other daddies and refuses to read any book that her father cannot read.  Then we get to the point where the System, in its infinite wisdom, takes the little girl away from her father.  When that happens we do not hear her screams, just the music turned up load, which reminded me of the extreme pathos of that same scene in Chaplin's ""The Kid,"" where not hearing Jackie Coogan scream for his dad did not matter.  Meanwhile, there is the whole bit as Sam wears down super lawyer Rita and gets her to remember that family might be as important as work.  In the beginning Rita is basically shamed into taking on Sam's case, but in the end she is emotionally involved in the case and the life of her client.  All that matters is reuniting father and daughter.
But the brain keeps asking some key questions about what is happening here.  First, why did the State wait until this point to question Sam's parenting?  The concern here is never about Lucy's safety with her father, but her desire to keep learning now that she is smarter than Sam.  Second, if Lucy had been of average intelligence and not a cute little blonde kid if the State would have found her a wonderful foster home with Randy (Laura Dern) and her husband?  I am inclined to think probably not.  Third, why are the Department of Children and Family Services lawyers portrayed as villains?  Every thing Turner says is true and he repeatedly makes it clear that his intention is the welfare of the child.  He is talking practical realities and not abstract ideals.
Twice in ""I Am Sam"" the film echoes the famous child custody film ""Kramer vs. Kramer.""  The first time the moment sneaks up on the audience, as well as most of the characters, and it signals a reversal in Sam's fortunes.  In fact, the next time I am reminded of the other film it again signals a reversal in Sam's fortunes, and that was the point at which the head shoved the heart aside and rendered its final verdict on this film.  I was not all that impressed with the rabbit coming out of the hat the first time around, and even less so the second time.
As for Penn's performance, I can see why he was nominated for an Academy Award given the propensity to give the Oscar to actors portraying handicapped individuals (Cliff Robertson in ""Charly,"" Hoffman in ""Rain Man,"" Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"").  But I have to admit that such mannered performances next strike me as being as finally nuanced as other great acting performance.  Still, he is good, and the scenes between him and Fanning sparkle.
Half the film is scored to covers of Beatles songs by Sarah McLachlan, Eddie Vedder and others, which makes for an interesting soundtrack album.  Ultimately, I decided to split the difference between the ranks given by the head and the heart on this one because I did enjoy it, even as I complained bitterly about all the problems I saw in ""I Am Sam.""  I embrace my contradictions, even in print and for public consumption.

This film has huge strengths in several areas.  First, the acting is stellar.  Sean Penn has received incredible accolades recently, and they are all deserved.  Next, the plot is not sensationalized.  It is steady and believable, and is not pushed ""over the top"" by the introduction of extreme plot twists.

Finally, I like the positive resolution reached at the end that acknowledges that good, competent parents come in many forms.

There are a few aspects of the film that are not so wonderful.  First it is about a half and hour too long.  The 3rd quarter of the story drags through the court hearings.

1713334,5,B000066HAS,"I saw this movie the same weekend that I saw John Q and I have to say that this was on the exact opposite end of the spectrum even though it's in the same genre! How is it on the opposite? Simply put, the emotions that it illicit are genuine.
Just from reading the plot above, I think it's fair to say that that there is a high chance that this movie could be a simple sob story that goes for the cliche in order to get you to cry. That NEVER happens in this film. Every emotion, although sometimes gut wrenching, is elicited genuinely from the actors and the story. I should also mention that I grew up next door to a mentally challenged neighbor, so I have had experience with the subject. Although Sam is clearly at the upper end of the spectrum in terms of mental deficiency, Penn nails the role and I think it's one of the best performances of his life. Playing the role of a retarded person is not easy. It's not just a matter of talking funny, or acting stupid - Penn clearly illustrates that fact. Not to mention that he's able to hold the screen acting opposite a child and 5 dogs!
In conjunction with Penn's performance, the writing is truly incredible. It's realistic and doesn't portray any of the characters as caricatures of themselves. Richard Schiff, for example, could have been portrayed as simply ""the bad guy"" in his role as Turner, State's Attorney. It would have been an easy choice for the writer's to make and unfortunately, it's a choice that many movies tend to make. Instead, Turner is portrayed as someone doing his job and looking out for the best interests of the child. Although it's one of the more minor roles of the film, the fact that none of characters were ""throw away"" just goes to how how well the script was written.
One other element that is often overlooked is the cinematography. Elliot Davis really gives this movie a unique style and feel in his photography and actually plays a role in telling the story. As the color pallets change for the perspective it makes it easier to tell where the perspective has changed as well. One of my favorite scenes involves the Sam in the courtroom and Davis' use of 4 cameras to capture the scene coupled with Richard Chew's editing makes that scene so compelling.
Lastly, I have to mention the performances given by the lead women in the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison, gives one of her best performances in her career. The arc that she is able to take her character is not easy. She goes from being someone who has very little in the way of redeeming qualities to someone you can deeply care for. She really stretched herself in this role and took some chances that pay off in spades. And last, but not least, Dakota Fanning plays Sam's daughter Lucy. I haven't seen Dakota in any other films yet, but now I want to. Although playing a child, when you're a child isn't much of a stretch, having to play a child that understands the mentally challenged is. The script gives her everything she needs for the scene, but Dakota has to deliver it and she does. Her talent is well beyond her years and the emotion she is able to convey through her eyes and in her reactions to other characters is truly impressive. Her role could have been the weak link that brought the movie to a much lower level, but she proved to be one of it's anchors.
Make no mistake about it, this is a tear jerker, but in the best sense of the word. It's an honest look at a unique situation that shows us many facets and pulls no punches.",1063929600,4,3523,4.421538461538462
1713335,4,B000066HAS,"A Film by Jessie Nelson
We are introduced to Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) at the very start of the movie.  He is working in a Starbucks and his job is to make sure the cups are straight, that the salt/sugar packets are aligned, and to bring customers coffee.  We learn without being directly told that Sam is mentally handicapped.  Not long after this introduction, Sam is told ""it is time.""  When he realizes that it is time, he hurries and walks very fast to a hospital, in time for his daughter to be born.  Shortly after the birth as he is bringing the little girl home with the mother, the mother takes off and Sam never sees her again.  Sam does not quite know what to do, but gets help from a neighbor.  He finds a routine so that he can function and he does not deviate from it.
The movie flashes forward several years so that Lucy (Dakota Fanning) is now 7 years old.  She is the sweetest little girl and initially not much is wrong.  Because of Lucy's age, Sam has a greater intellectual capacity and Lucy only notices that Sam is different.  She loves him, though, so she doesn't let it bother her.  As she gets a little bit older, she surpasses Sam intellectually and when she brings a friend home, the little boy calls asks Lucy if her father is ""retarded"".  This point begins the downward spiral that ends when Lucy is taken away from Sam by the Police and Child Services.  Sam had (unknowingly) made some mistakes that were misconstrued as being worse than they may have been.
We are now introduced to lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfieffer).  Rita is initially unwilling to take the case, but agrees to work pro bono.  This point is about halfway through the movie and the rest of the movie is mostly the interaction between Rita, Sam, and Lucy (though Lucy is out of the movie for long stretches of time) and how Rita can possibly win Lucy back through court.  The movie also addresses the question of whether or not a mentally handicapped man is physically capable of raising a child, and also if he should do so.  Throughout the movie I was torn on that issue and I'm not positive that I came up with a good answer to that question.  Sam has such a strong support system in place that his deficiencies are more than made up with his friends who love Lucy like their own.
I was surprised by this movie.  It was better than I expected after watching the trailer.  Sean Penn gives a fine performance as Sam and Michelle Pfieffer is believable in her role as a lawyer who is falling apart in her personal life with her family.  Everyone does a good job in their roles but the standout is little Dakota Fanning.  She is absolutely perfect.  She is so sweet, gentle and kind that you really want her life to turn out fine no matter all the troubles with her father, the court, and the foster family.  I think that it is because of Fanning that this movie succeeds.  You really start to care for Lucy and it is a credit to Dakota Fanning that any such connection is made.  I Am Sam is a good movie with a great performance.",1063584000,,3030,4.366071428571429

This is one of the best movies made in 2001.  It was written, directed, and produced with heavy heart and soul.  Sean Penn's Oscar nominated performance as a mentally challenged father is his best of his career.  He proves that he heavily researched his role before filming as do the crew.  Michelle Pfeiffer performs at her best in years as a Penn's stressed lawyer.  Seven-year-old Dakota Fanning makes a wonderful debut as Penn's daughter.

In all of its overflowing emotion, there is a true feeling of truth and humanity that grabbed me as a viewer. Most importantly, Penn did an amazing job making Sam into a convincing and human character, very seldom over-the-top.
  From all the other reviews you know the premise of the movie--the mentally handicapped man with the heart fo gold trying to keep his family intact--so I won't regurgitate that. Sure, this film utilizes some stereotypes, not to even mention the dazzling array of less-than-subtle product placements...but it pulls the whole thing off with a certain sense of real human value. Dakota Fanning as the young daughter never falls victim to crappy-child-actor syndrome; she's sweet and believable in a totally un-cloying sort of way. Overall, the film is a grand story of a non-traditional family fighting to stay together on an endearingly small-scale. Come on, this movie actually made me cry, a lot...and if you can suck it up and allow yourself to enjoy that sort of thing, it can actually be a powerful viewing-experience. I highly recommend this film for a night when you are willing to let yourself get caught up in a sweet story with some outstanding acting and quirky little twists. Trust me, this movie is a joy to watch, and I don't say that about many movies... I think this is the first crier-film I've ever REALLY loved.",1056672000,2,1458,4.875

I've never really liked him so this is a major concession to say his is one of the greatest performances by any actor at any time. Why he didn't win the Oscar for this is beyond me. Having worked for Child Protective Services for 3 years myself I found their roles and attitudes very credible. The soundtrack irked me the 1st viewing but then I realized there may be some copyright laws disallowing the use of the original Beatle's recordings and perhaps having others perform the songs was actually better.

On her 7th bday, the Child Family service thing comes and takes her away, believing that Sam isn't capable of taking care of his daughter.  He (accidentally) finds himself a probono lawyer Rita (Michelle Pheifer), and together, they work the case out, and figure out the different problems and troubles both the normal, 'perfect' people and the a mentally challenged person.
This can make you cry, I can gaurentee you.  Penn does a wonderful job acting mental in the movie, but also shows his affection and care for his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning).  Michelle Pheifer at first is a money-money-money lawyer, but when she lies to her colleagues that she will help Sam for free, she keeps her words, and helps him fight.  Through the process, they encounter difficulties, just like everyone in this world does, and soon they learn how to cope with them.
This movie shows how a normal person and a mentally-disabled person see the world and each other.  Sam thinks Rita (Pheifer) is perfect, while she really wants to have that quality time he has to spend with her own son.

We hired a babysitter and went to the theatre and I had to walk out about 15 minutes into it.  The acting of Sean Penn was so convincing that all it did was fill me with panic about what my little one's life will eventually be like.  When it came out on video I rented it and watched it at home alone (where noone can see you cry) I just couldn't get past the fact that while no one doubted that Sam loved Lucy completely he was NOT capable of taking care of her as she needed to be.  The acting was phenomenal by everyone involved but the simple truth that this movie didn't make clear is that love is NOT all you need.  Little girls need security, safety, guidance and discipline as much as they need love.  I wish ""I Am Sam"" had gone a little further into exploring the alternatives available for Sam and Lucy. I wish it had been less black and white, simplistic and politically correct.  It would have made it a better movie, one worthy of the acting I saw on the screen.",1050710400,11,1071,4.169902912621359

1713346,5,B000066HAS,"I will admit, I make fun of my mom for crying in movies. And even the not-so-sad movies, she'll still cry about them. I'm not an emotional person when it comes to films, because the way the actors act and portray their characters usually doesn't convince me or tamper with my tears. Come to think of it, I think the only one that made me shed tears was ""Snowman"" back when I was about 5 years old. This, however, had me wiping my nose and eyes every minute. AND I HATE IT! But when an actor or an actress can convince you so well to feel bad for them, you know they've done it. And that's EXACTLY what this movie did to me.
Sean Penn played his role so well you'd think he was actually handicapped like that. He never, ever, even the slightest bit broke out of character, which is amazing. His struggle to regain custody of his child is tear material, but the fact that he's handicapped and no one thinks he can makes the movie toy with your mind. It worked for me.
Michelle Pfeiffer did an amazing job as well. She has always impressed me with every role; from ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" to ""What Lies Beneath"". She proved herself again. She did a great job protraying the lawyer she portrayed; my mom is almost the exact same way, and our life unfolded quite like hers. A movie is even more convincing when you can relate to it personally. Also, a woman who can look that great at 45 deserves just an award for that.
The thing I liked most about this movie was the way that it was shot. The angles they used, and the almost ""casual"" sense of shooting I guess. The constant jerking of the camera, the zooming in and zooming out. Movies aren't usually shot that way, but this movie pulls it off beautifully and it fits it perfect.
Great, great, GREAT movie. And how come no Academy Awards or Golden Globes? The movie was jipped, and so were Penn and Pfeiffer.

1713347,5,B000066HAS,"Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer remind us that love is all you need in this touching story about life, love and laughter.
""I Am Sam"" is the story of a mentally challenged father (Sean Penn) who enlists a high profile lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to help him regain custody of his daughter (played by the marvellous Dakota Fanning who would go on to appear in Steven Spielberg's ""TAKEN"").
At the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Sam and see him working at his job in Starbucks. Soon after we see a woman giving birth to a young baby. Sam names the baby Lucy, based on a Beatles song. The mother who it turns out was homeless and just needed somewhere to stay one night didn't plan on having a baby with Sam, and so runs off later, leaving a very disoriented Sam with the baby. Sam makes the decision to take his baby home. Although their are several problems initially, Sam is helped by his fellow mentally challenged friends. Lucy reaches the age of 7 and her school teachers meet Sam and express concerns. Sam's mental age is that of a 7 year old, and they are concerned about what happens when Lucy turns 8. Eventually social services become involved and Lucy is taken away from Sam. Based on advice from his friends, Sam seeks the help of a lawyer to get Lucy back.
Sometimes when movies are advertised they are given a tag line. When this was released in the UK in 2002, a British newspaper described ""I Am Sam"" as the ""tearjerker of the year"". It can often be said that people can't dictate how you feel, and so if someone tells you the film is going to be a tearjerker then it quite often won't deliver. It's like having extremely high expectations for a movie. You are quite likely to be disappointed. I'm glad I wasn't with this, and it certainly delivered.
To be honest, the main reason I wanted to see this movie was because I'd seen such an inspired performance from Dakota Fanning in ""TAKEN"", that I wanted to see more here. If I hadn't wanted to see more of Dakota then I quite possibly would have missed out on this movie. All of acting in this movie from leads and the supporting cast is just perfect for this kind of movie. The direction by director and co-writer Jessie Nelson is very thought out and the director of photography has his work cut out, especially when it comes to seeing the world the way Sam would see it. I was ready for this movie not to deliver on some of the emotion, but fortunately it did, creating a very memorable movie experience.
The DVD features a Commentary by director/Co-screenwriter Jessie Nelson and it is very delicately done. Jessie Nelson is informative and has such a wonderful vocal quality. I could almost imagine her being a narrator like Dakota Fanning was on ""TAKEN"". Jessie Nelson is very compassionate about this project as any director should be. So much so, that this is probably the first time I'd describe a DVD commentary as being beautiful.
Also on the DVD is a Theatrical trailer and the Original Documentary: ""Becoming Sam"" which is a fascinating look at what it took to put the movie together, as well as Deleted and Alternate Scenes with optional director commentary. Also featured on this Region 1 US DVD version is some DVD-ROM CONTENT including Script-to-Screen, Link to Original Website and Hot Spot. The movie itself is in Widescreen anamorphic format.

It's about an autistic man who is fond of the Beatles and is trying to raise a young daughter.  Child services tries to ""protect"" the child by placing her in separate custody.  A court battle ensues.
  Good points: Excellent acting.  Dakota Fanning was only 7 years old when she made this.  And anyone who can go toe to toe in acting across from Sean Penn is quite an actor.
  The not so good points: Too much hand-held camerawork.  Odd use of monochromatic filters (green and later in the film, blue).  Uneven pacing.  Inability to sustain my interest.
  The DVD: Looks sharp and sounds great.
  DVD extras: I was not interested enough in this film to check out extras, but there seems to be a fair amount.

1713350,4,B000066HAS,"As a mentally challenged man with the intellectual capability of a 7-year-old, Sean Penn - quite possibly the best working actor today - earned his third Oscar nomination in this sentimental but powerful film. Sam works as a table clearer at a Starbucks' coffee shop and is also father to a 7-year-old girl he had with a homeless woman. The two apparently get along fine until a series of haphazard dynamics collide to find Sam's daughter as a ward of the state. In his bid to reclaim his child, Sam turns to attorney Michelle Pfeiffer, a fast-moving lady who's compromised her sense of humanity in favor of professional fulfillment. Her belief that she needs only her profession for self-fulfillment is dangerously imperiled by Sam's humanity, innocent as it is from the perspective of a 7-year-old. Of course, there are the court scenes in which Sam is made to look as a well-intentioned but incapable provider to his child, until the sentimental but still moving finale in which Sam takes on the judicial system himself. Just as he was so absorbed in his role as a ""Dead Man Walking,"" Penn is so completely into the character of Sam that his raw talent is incredible. Sure, maybe the film is a two-hanky one and the its goal is to move its audience by parading the unjust dilemmas of an underdog, ""I Am Sam"" is nonetheless a wonderfully moving film with a feel-good finale.

The soundtrack also reflects this. Once his daughter reaches school age a trial begins to see if he is a fit father for this little girl.

I've never been that into him before seeing this film, but I gotta say that this was one of the best performances I've ever seen any actor give, in any medium.  This film itself is a shamelessly manipulative tear-jerker, in the grand Hollywood tradition, but more effective than most because the story is so terrifyingly plausible and agonizing to watch.  It's especially hard to watch Sam make mistakes that, on the outside, seem painfully obvious, but within the logic of his world are all but inevitable.  Granted, some of the plot points are a bit hackneyed, but, hey, this is a Hollywood film.  What do you expect?

1713355,5,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" is one of the best and underrated films of 2001.
Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) has the intelligence of a seven-year-old. He has a seven-year-old daughter Lucy (the very delightful Dakota Fanning). Child's Services take Lucy away from Sam and Sam hires (probono) lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfieffer) to defend him and get his daughter back.
The movie has a great script, real characters and although the film was filmed with handheld cameras, I thought the cinematography was extremely unique. I even liked the computer keyboard and high heel noises Sam heard while he was at Rita's law firm office. The DVD extras were fantanstic, they showed how Sean Penn prepared for his role as Sam. He imitated mentally-handicapped people in a respectful and dignified way, I really thought he deserved an Academy Award his role. Michelle Pfieffer gives one of the best performances of her career and Dakota Fanning shines in one of her first movie roles.
""I Am Sam"" will leave you feeling good inside, this is honestly one of the only movies I have seen where I left the theatre feeling good and seeing the world in a different way. The music, all of which is by the Beatles, is unique and I liked Dianne Wiest as Sam's neighbor Annie. To rekindle the human spirit, ""I Am Sam"" is the film for you.",1035676800,,1294,4.6798245614035086
1713356,4,B000066HAS,"When I first began to watch this movie, I squirmed a lot mentally.  However, I think that squirming had more to do with not being comfortable with mentally challenged people than the quality of the movie.  This movie once again reminded me how much I admire people who work with the handicapped.
Sean Penn does an outstanding job of portraying mentally challenged Sam Dawson.  Sam has the intelligence of a 7-year-old, which means his 7-year-old daughter, the incredibly adorable Dakota Fanning playing Lucy Diamond Dawson, is rapidly passing him in intellectual capacity.  As with many movies of this type, events happen that cause ""The Authorities"" to take Lucy away from Sam.  Sam obtains a lawyer, Rita Harrison, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, to win his daughter back.  Diane Wiest plays Annie, a concerned and intelligent neighbor with some bizarre mental problems of her own.  Laura Dern plays Randy, a foster parent interested in adopting the adorable Lucy because clearly she and her husband can give Lucy a better home and life than Sam.
Before I give you the critical comments, I want you to understand that I liked this movie.  I thought it was uplifting and positive.  Sean Penn did an outstanding job comparable to that of Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".  Though I didn't care for all of the interpretations of The Beatles music, any movie which features Beatles music must have some merit.
Okay, my less than positive comments:  I thought Michelle Pfeiffer did a wonderful job.  However, in places she was a little over the top.  I thought one of her best moments was when she broke down with Sam, admitting that while Sam thought she was ""perfect"", she was anything but.  I think that the director had a great actress and should have let her do her job, and not directed her the way he did, which led to places where she is unbelievable.  Laura Dern was a serious disappointment.  Laura has a lot of ability (see ""Mask"" as an example), but here the majority of her acting is providing these ""looks"" of disapproval or approval or whatever.  Very annoying.  Again, I credit the director with making less than maximum use of a very good actress.  One last negative comment.  When Sam got all dressed up for court with a suit provided to him by Rita, and then had him going to work at Starbucks, I knew immediately that he was going to get something all over the suit.  Everybody watching the movie knew it too.  The actors in the movie should have known it as well.  If I had a court date and worked at Starbucks, I guarantee you the suit would have not been on until shortly before my court appearance.  And somehow all of the ""intelligent"" people around Sam couldn't foresee and prevent this from happening.  Makes me wonder who the mentally challenged person in the movie was.
Some more positive comments:  Dakota Fanning is a name we will be hearing more about in the future.  An absolutely adorable little girl who was perfectly believable throughout the movie.  The other mentally challenged characters in the movie were also believable.  The Beatles music was well matched to the various scenes of the movie.  The Beatles trivia was really interesting, and factual.
I'm not sure what to say about the bobbling camera.  There were places where it was used to try and give you a ""real life"" kind of feel.  In a few places it was a little distracting.  Eventually I got used to it as I became involved with the characters and the story.
Conclusion:  I would definitely watch the movie again, though not for a while.  Not a ""must buy"" for me, though if you are into character stories, this movie could be a good one for your collection.",1035676800,3,3670,4.7080062794348505

We meet Sam as an adult, working in a Starbuck's coffee shop, rushing to the hospital to witness the birth of his daughter.  Fond of The Beatles, Sam names the baby Lucy Diamond Dawson.  Lucy's mother wants nothing to do with Sam or their daughter.  She takes off as soon as they leave the hospital.  With the help of his mentally challenged friends and the eccentric recluse Annie, Sam raises Lucy in his tiny apartment.  She grows up to become a well-rounded, highly intelligent little girl.  Lucy's feelings about her father alternate between contentment and embarrassment.  When Sam is arrested for solicitation, his family situation comes under scrutiny.  Believing that a man with the mind of a 7-year-old can not effectively raise a child, Lucy is taken from Sam.  Sam enlists the aid of hyperactive, cold-hearted lawyer, Rita Harrison.
Keep your Kleenex handy!  You'll alternate between hysterical laughter and boughts of tears.  Sam's fight to get custody of Lucy changes the lives of those around him.  You begin to realize that Sam has almost everything a father can offer a child, and begin to root for him and his struggle.  Even his lawyer has something to learn from Sam.
Sean Penn's performance in this movie is incredible.  He really did his homework on this one!  Very believable!  Dakota Fanning plays the intelligent, insightful Lucy.  This child's career is one to watch - a bright shining new star.  You'll find yourself alternating between hating and loving Michelle Pfeiffer's character, Rita Harrison.  All of the actors in this movie do a terrific job.  I loved this movie!  Can't wait to watch it again!",1032739200,,1778,4.9324324324324325
1713361,5,B000066HAS,"I Am Sam is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.
Sean Penn has certainly come a long way in his acting career from surfer dude Jeff Spicolli in (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) to the incredibly powerful performance he gives as a mentally challenged father who fights for the custody of his daughter Lucy.
I Am Sam will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you realize that the best thing you can do for any child as a parent is show them love and affection. Michelle Pfieffer's character, as Penn's lawyer, goes through a transformation in the film. She begins as a cold hearted, money hungry woman who seems to care about nothing but her job and herself. However after meeting sam she is transformed into a caring, loving human being.
If you want a great movie, with a great story, a lot of emotion and Academy Award worth acting then you MUST SEE I Am Sam. If your the emotional type may I suggest you get your box of tissues ready because you'll need them.",1031961600,6,989,4.294117647058823

I should warn you, if you don't like to cry or don't like schmaltzy type films...don't waste your time.  But, if you are the sensitive, compassionate, emotional type who loves to just sit and watch two tissue box type flix!  This is one to see.
Michelle Pfieffer is completely disconnected in this film. Mark my words...that doesn't mean she didn't do a good job...rather, she did an excellent job because that was what was required of her character.  Her character is cold, calculated, frazzled, and disenchanted.  She's a terrible mother struggling to understand why her son hates her... well...she's a terrible mother!  Her character is disconnected from life and Ms. Pfieffer does a supreme job getting this across.  She is a pleasure to behold as she grows and gets a clue!
Mr. Penn...what can I say.  He made me experience his anguish right along with him.  His characters need for routine is disrupted on many occasion and the resulting emotions were sometimes too much to bear.  Kudos to him and his talent.
Not for everybody - but if you like films (not movies) and your mind, spirit, and heart are open to new ideas, perspectives, and you like to see True Love conquer all (Did you like The Other Sister???) then this is a movie for you!",1030665600,,1498,4.745173745173745

The state or the society draws a mark between normal & not-normal individuals, (probably) with the noblest intentions but with an insensitive means.
It was no longer expounded how Sam impregnated a stray woman or if that child has been his at all.  But regardless of that fact, we see Sam fight for his daughter's life, her love & her happiness albeit his mental (& financial)inability to fulfill her needs (except for his unflagging love & loyalty).
This film also shows the contrast between Sam's simplistic but happy & fulfilled life (prior to the state taking his daughter) vs. Rita's successful career but degenerating family relationship.  Let us all pause for a while & think who is really incapable here of living a happy & healthy life...Sam, who is mentally inept but has earned his daughter's full trust & love, or Rita (who represents all of us) who is mentally competent but couldn't decipher how to run her own life & those she loves?
Most of the time, we outgrow the heart & mind of a child...a child who is trusting, loving, honest, willing, succumbing.  But Sam, (thanks or no-thanks to his shortcoming) has more heart than any of the 'normal' people have.",1029801600,,1407,4.703252032520325

(even better than the Lord of The Rings!) Sean Penn's Character, Sam, a mentally chalenged person (with the mental capacity of a seven-year-old) working at a Starbucks. He is pulled out of work to see his wife ( ?I don't know who she was) giving birth in the hospital. Waiting for the bus, she deserts him, leaving this retarded person to raise a baby. With the help of a neighbor, he actually does. Once his daughter, Lucy, goes into school, she finds out how different her dad is, and is often poked fun at. After a special birthday party, made special by Sam, goes haywire, Sam is questioned in court about being able to raise a daughter. After meeting a lawyer (Pfiefer) who is, in the spotlight of her lawyer friends, agrees to do the case pro bono. The ret of the movie has very heart-wrenching and sad parts.

1713369,2,B000066HAS,"What do you get when you combine ""Rain Man"", 1968's ""Charly"", and Chaplin's ""The Kid""? Well, you get something like ""I Am Sam"" (which could have been sub-titled ""Sean Penn's Bid for an Oscar""), but not nearly as good as these aforementioed films. Which is not to say that Penn, as the ""developmentally disabled"" Sam Dawson, does not give an Oscar caliber performance -as does the radiant Michelle Pfeiffer as his frazzled, type-A lawyer, and Dakota Fanning as his preternaturally precocious and adorable daughter. No, the problem with ""I am Sam"" does not reside with its cast, but with a script that is not satisfied to merely push your feel-good buttons, but rather to jab them with Lennox Lewis's boxing gloves. Not content to tug at our heart strings, but like Lovely Rita Meter Maid, drive up a truck and tow your whole ticker away. Speaking of the Beatles, whom Sam is obsessed with and whose songs, covered by various contemporary artists, saturate the film -well I'm a big a fan as anyone -but the whole thing feels like a gratuitous and irrelevant conceit -more a cynical marketing ploy, calculated to further add to the film's cloying sentiments -than serving any integral facet of the film's plot or theme. Thus, at crucial points in the film as Sam battles with the wicked Blue Meanies from the state child welfare system, he blurts out bewildering non sequitirs of Beatles trivia such as the fact that Paul and John lost their mothers at a young age; that Yoko was not really to blame for breaking up the group; that George Harrison wrote one of the better songs on ""Abbey Road"" and Pfeiffer's character, (Rita Harrison, no less), says George was her favorite Beatle. Well, that all may be very interesting, but what bearing to has on a potentially serious drama examining the abilities of profoundly retarded man to be an effective father, is a bit of puzzlement. I guess where supposed to settle complacently with little Lucy's assertion that ""all you need is love"". Well, yeah, sure you need lots of love, but you need other things as well - a fact with which ""I am Sam"", a simplistic exercise in bathos chooses not to deal.",1028851200,5,2139,4.721925133689839
1713370,3,B000066HAS,"Basically, this is a good story, with some good acting.  But any chance of it being a great movie was destroyed by, least of all, directing and editing flaws and numerous storyline implausibilities, but most of all, an unprecedented level of product placement.  In fact, I would say that the commerciality of this film is a real blow to the work of the actors, as well as a slap in the audience's face.  But what is more shocking to me, is that none of the posting reviewers seems to think this is important.  Why are people so kind about a movie so absolutely OVERWHELMED with product placement???  I have never seen a movie filled with this much advertising.  If I were any of the actors in this film, I would be sure to get my next role in a real film, rather than a big commercial that blatantly utilizes our emotional responsiveness to repeatedly slam products into our heads.  For godsakes, they put Sam's daughter Lucy in front of a 7-11 each and every time she goes to see him at night...  I truly wish there were more commentary on this, for we are ensuring that this goes on by saying nothing.  Honestly, if I had known I'd be watching a two-hour commercial, I NEVER would have watched this film.  Why are we PAYING to be advertised to?  If this continues, they should be pay us at the cinema door.  Let me repeat, this was an okay movie ... but I could barely see it through the commercials.",1028332800,6,1402,4.391472868217054
1713371,2,B000066HAS,"Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert makes a very interesting point in movie reviews when he says the playing a mentally handicapped person is one of the easiest (and least impressive) acting jobs.  Any role involving a handicapped person basically directs itself.  It's not terribly hard for an actor to assume the mannerisms of a person with a disability.  Yet, it often proves to be one of the most manipulative acting conventions out there.  Audiences tend to get emotionally moved by actors in such roles without truly realizing that most of these actors bring little or no depth to the character they're playing.  A classic movie where an actor played a mentally handicapped individual and was able to do so in a way that provided depth and genuine emotion was ""Rain Man"" with Dustin Hoffman in that role.

  Unfortunately, the movie ""I Am Sam"" does not provide that kind of depth of character in Sean Penn's portrayal of Sam Dawson, a handicapped person with the mental capacity of a 7-year old.  Sam unwittingly got a homeless woman pregnant and, after the birth of his daughter, is left to raise the child by himself when the woman just runs away after delivery.  It's quite possible that a touching movie could have been made out of this premise had the powers that be not decided that the messages of ""handicapped people can be good parents"" and ""all you need is love"" needed to be drilled home every 5 minutes.  Almost anytime Sam is asked a question or forced to deal with something complex, he resorts to quoting Beatles' lyrics and lore.  This seems to be the director's way heavy-handed way of showing the audience that all the answers to life can be found in the Beatles' music.  Much more disconcerting than Sam's attempts to raise his daughter Lucy (as in 'in the Sky with Diamonds'... ha ha.. get it?), is Lucy's dialogue with Sam.  She may well be very intelligent for her age (7 years), but some of her dialogue is uncomfortably grownup.  Of all the children I have known in my life, I have never known a 7-year old who would spout comments like Lucy does.  It's very clear that the directors put more adult dialogue in the script for her to recite in order for her to seem more intelligent and, I guess, providing a more 'touching' contrast with Sam.

  The rest of the movie surrounds a perfunctory court case where the state is trying to take Lucy away from Sam because they do not think he is a fit father.  This, of course, brings out yuppie lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer (in her worst performance since ""Scarface"") agreeing to do this case pro-bono and, of course, learning from Sam the truly important lessons in life.  The court scenes bring out every conceivable cliche' and melodramatic acting from Pfeiffer objecting to just about everything opposing counsel says to emotionally overwrought speaches by Sam, Pfeiffer's character, and a so-called 'expert' witness.  The movie, itself, is quite insulting in its treatment of the subject matter and is aggravating in its insistence on reminding you that you're watching and important 'message' movie.  Interestingly enough, the best acting performance in this movie comes from one of Sam's friends, Brad, who's portrayer, Brad Silverman, actually has Down Syndrome.  His words and actions are very genuine, and the director would have been well advised to pattern Sean Penn's performance on how Brad carries himself in everyday life.

  This movie is terribly heavy-handed and manipulative.  Unless you enjoy having your emotions manipulated, I would advise skipping this movie.",1027987200,11,3558,4.885
1713372,4,B000066HAS,"...but this movie was okay.  The contrast between Penn and Pfeiffer's characters was well done.  The insight offered by Penn's character (Sam) into his lawyer's life was excellent.  The courtroom scenes were too prolonged.  The relationship between Sam and Lucy was touching, especially when the 7-11 was involved, and the outcome was feel-goodish.
I would have liked to have seen less of the legal battle and more of life after the closing credits.  What happened to the characters after the credits rolled.  How did Lucy turn out?  How did Pfeiffer's character turn out and did she really reprioritize her life or not.  We get some implied answers, but the crew who put this together missed the boat.

In the course of this movie he took me through a gamut of emotions - amusement, sadness, anger, embarrassment, love, joy and more.
Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance as the beautiful, wealthy lawyer who learns more from Sam about living success-fully than he learns about the world from her.

1713375,5,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" is a great movie, not perfect, but one I will want to revisit.  The handheld camera style that resembles NYPD Blue tries to give a realistic look to the picture, but doesn't totally work.  The scene where Sam Dawson is arrested for solicitation is totally unbelievable, given the circumstance and Penn's convincing innocence.  Unfortunately, this contrivance is the catalyst to launch the story.  However, despite these blips, the story is moving.
As Penn fights for his daughter Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after the Beatles' song, how can any father not be touched?  The picture boils to down to the incredible and irreplaceable need for love which children and adults have.  Without it, we wither.  The performances are excellent.  Will somebody please give Michelle Pfeiffer a great film role so she can get her Oscar?  What a talented actress!  The levels she reaches are breathtaking.  The scene where she tells Dawson that she is not perfect and breaks down is a tour de force.  Penn is so amazing in this picture.  He has the mannerisms and is a bastian of focused concentration.  The supporting cast is also great.  Loretta (Boston Public) Divine as the evil social worker and Richard (West Wing) Schiff as the evil attorney are people we can love to hate.  Dakota Fanning as the delightful Lucy tugs at the heartstrings.  The scene where she knows she is being observed and says, ""I want to be with my daddy,"" and then turns to the observation glass and shouts, ""Did you hear that?"" is a bullet to the heart.  Laura Dern, Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Weist are also all great.  Then there's the soundtrack!  When Rufus Wainwright sings ""Across the Universe,"" I want to stop the film and run to the stereo.  The DVD deleted scenes are quite interesting.  Penn & Fanning on the bus with the repeated joke about ""Knock Knock, Orange,"" puts a smile on your face.  The deleted takes of Penn getting upset with coffee customers are also final take quality.  This film is great because it succeeds in reminding us about our humanity and that our love for our children should always of primary importance.  It reminds us of our own zest for love.

Much of the poignancy of the story is diluted, however, by a number of failures. Had these been attended to, this movie could have realized its five star potential.
Sean Penn does a mediocre imitation of Dustin Hoffman's ""Rainman"" character ... and with the frequent references to Kramer Versus Kramer throughout the movie, this is incredibly distracting. The character of ""Benny"" on the old LA Law TV show demonstrated a much more convincing portrayal of somebody mentally challenged.
Speaking of Kramer Versus Kramer, the final resolution is lifted almost directly from that movie--quite a disappointment. Michelle Pfeifer's character, as Penn's attorney, feels like a caricature, rather than a believable person. Oddly enough, her transformation, a sideshow to the main story line, demonstrates the most character growth of any of the major players ... and reflects Dustin Hoffman's transformation in Kramer Versus Kramer.
This movie does demonstrate, however, the capricious nature of our social service system. We expect social workers to make good decisions about child welfare while we fail to provide budgets for adequate staffing. In this movie, that isn't made clear, all we see are social workers and therapists reacting to Sam out of prejudice. Off the silver screen, committed and well-meaning social workers and child therapists carry unrealistic case loads and cannot help but make mistakes, such as we see in this movie, on a regular basis.
It's a good movie. Alas, it could have been much better. Enjoyable and somewhat provocative. Useful if it gets people to pay attention to how their local Department of Child and Family Services actually works.

Sean Penn does another one of his top of the line acting jobs whereas Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her career as the lawyer who really doesn't want his case.  If you don't know any retarded people, divorce lawyers, agoraphobiacs, prosecutors, foster parents or social workers, then you may feel this film is off the mark.  Having worked as a divorce lawyer for a decade though, I can tell you this film is spot on to both the system and people it portrays.

If you have any lingering doubts about Penn's acting abilities, you should view back to back this film, ""Carlito's Way,"" ""Dead Man Walking"" ""She's So Lovely"" and ""Sweet and Low Down."" Penn is totally convincing in each as a 1) retarded man who is father of bright daughter, 2) coke addled criminal defense attorney, 3) convinct about to be executed for rape and murder who connects with a nun, 4) man in marginal existence with wife, due to mental illness, who acts out in violence one night and consequences that ensue 5) wholly self absorbed, brilliant jazz musician.

I've read that he never wins the Oscar because although the members of the Academy love his work, they hate him personally.  I've also read that Penn finds acting to be very exhausting, painful work because it takes everything out of him. I think it's about time the Academy started rewarding those who actually ""work"" at the acting profession, like Penn does, rather than running a popularity contest.  Fortunately, the Cannes jury, famously more concerned about solely one's artistic ability, has singled him out for such honors.

All movies listed above have relatively realistic depictions of ""some"" of the challenges faced by disabled individuals. How can I make such a statement?  Answer. I myself have a disability.
The entire cast did an outstanding job, but if I had to pick for ""The One to Watch"", in movies. It would have to be Dakota Fanning, ""Lucy."" This little actress will definitely be going places.

  I have unending praise for the actors who gave excellent performances to pull you into this sometimes unrealistic story, they all but mended the flaws in the actual plot. This movie is an excellent way to spend a random evening.
  And for those who cry foul at the Starbucks placements, I have a question. Is not the fact that the coffee shop IS A STARBUCKS, which you now find on every corner in America, the stab of reality you were begging for?!",1025481600,2,1063,4.106280193236715
1713385,3,B000066HAS,"Sean Penn gives an award-winning performance (although both he and Russell Crowe were beaten out for best actor this year) as a retarded father of a 7 year old girl -- the result of an unlikely encounter with a homeless woman whom we never meet in the movie.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays his pro bono attorney when the state finally decides (after seven years, mind you) that Sam is an unfit parent (for reasons that seem too trivial to be believable).
Although the movie does hint that Sam had assistance from his neighbor in raising his daughter, the viewer later discovers that the ""helpful neighbor"" hasn't left her apartment building in more than two decades.
Hmmm....
The movie also sort of hints that Sam's other mentally challenged buddies assisted him in rearing his daughter for seven years.
I suppose that's possible...
It would have been helpful if the movie had given its viewers a  reason to believe that Sam was capable of raising a child from birth to age seven.  It was hard to get past that point, but the rest of the movie helps...
The movie's portrayal of the mentally challenged was neither insulting nor patronizing... I could easily see Sam and his friends leading productive lives without assistance.
The movie was also realistic in its ending -- which is good, since it had an unrealistic (or at least doubtful) beginning.
What the heck -- buy it.  It's something to watch when the cable's out.",1025481600,,1415,4.763265306122449
1713386,5,B000066HAS,"Sean Penn gives a very realistic performance in this film. The idea behind this film is compelling and has moments when it just reaches out to you and begs for some recognition of humanity which society has lost somewhere along the line. Your heart just goes out to this guy that Sean Penn creates on the screen. The subtle and thought provoking script bolsters these feelings with its deliberate progression delivering a cohesive story line that a fixated audience can follow. The well-constructed parallels between Penn and his attorney Michelle Pfeiffer are credibility told with equal subtlety. An impressive and surprising role was that of Laura Dern's who seems destined to give the audience the conventional performance of the pseudo holier-than-thou protective foster parent but comes to learn more about the motivations of Penn than does Pfeiffer. That part of the film was delicately played for an emotional impact and it certainly delivers one. Sean Penn deserves some credible recognition for his performance in this film that has been long overdue. He should have been given credible consideration for the Academy Award. Even better, he should have won! Sean Penn gave one of the best performances I have ever seen in a film. He was that character. You never really think that this is an actor for a single moment. Sean Penn was perfect. I was so much more moved watching him again on this DVD than when I saw this in the theater. Sean Penn and this film really moved me.",1025222400,7,1484,4.892857142857143
1713387,3,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" belongs to a category of so-called ""love-or-hate"" movie because of its too sweet nature as a tearjerker, so I tried at first to concentrate on writing about what you see on the screen, but I failed.  Sorry, but I know my personal opinion would be reduced to nothing in front of your sentiments if you are a kind of a person who gets a handkerchief ready by your side before you start watching this film.  I know.
Sean Penn is Sam, who is mentally-challenged, but has no trouble working at Starbucks Coffee, and he loves the Beatles so much that he memorizes many anecdotes of the Fab Four, and sometimes quotes them before his daughter Lucy (who is naturally named after the song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"").  They are living happily until the authority decides to ""protect"" Lucy from her father, questioning his capacity as father.  Through the courtroom scenes, with an accidental 'pro bono' help from lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer, Sam tries to take back his loved daughter.
The best thing about this film is NOT, against your all  expectations, Sean Penn's acting, which has nothing wrong with itself, though.  As Roger Ebert rightly says, his bitter-sweet turn in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"" is better than this one, considering the depth and complicated portrait of the  character peppered with very sweet arrogance.  No, the best part of the movie comes from its soundtrack that consists of cover versions of the Beatles.  Culled mainly from their works of later era (around and after ""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""White Album""), the songs are perfect.  But it is THE Beatles, so why not?  (One of the interesting thing that ""Two of Us"" is played by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn, yes, Sean's brother.)
The worst part is, probably as you all agree, the script that wanders from one type of clithe to another, without knowing where to stop.  In fact, nothing rings true, after careful consideration.  Pfeiffer's lawyer, always high-strung, has troubles with her kid, and her hubby is away from home, presumably having affair with someone else (but do you when your wife is this gorgeous Pfeiffer?) and so on and on.  And about Sam -- this is the point -- he sometimes looks as if he is trying to blow up the case he possibly can win.  And his friends for that matter.  To make matters worse, new foster mather Laura Dern is NOT a cold-blooded monster who loves to beat the children.  No, she really loves the girl Lucy, it is clear, and Sam knows it.  So, why don't they think about the possibility of raising the kid TOGETHER?  Or, how about an idea of joint custody?  I don't know American legal system of today, but I know there's a way out.  They should have included another Beatle song: ""We Can Work it Out.""
Acting as a whole is, as I said, very good and convincing, and child actor Dakota Fanning is a real find.  Because of her and the excellent soundtrack, I give one more star to this two-star vehicle for Penn, whose talent is undeniable though I firmly believe that this is not the way he should be given an  Oscar.",1025136000,6,3038,4.605947955390334

Amid his hearty efforts, he fails at first but then, with the aid of his solicitor, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, he regains his ability to carry on. What touched me, as it touched various other viewers, is how Sam, amid the fact that he has an IQ of a seven year old, tries to get his daughter back. Even though he barely comprehends what is actually happening, he vows to carry on. And at the end he eventually wins. Michelle Pfeiffer'S role was a bit epigrammatic though, as she appeared in thr movie, after half of it had passed. However, this did not take away the charm of the movie.

1713392,4,B000066HAS,"Sean Penn, truly, has grown to become a splendid actor. His performance in this film is hugely affecting, very credible. Dakota Fanning (where on earth did they find this heavenly child?) is simply wonderful--achingly beautiful and scarily talented for such a young child. The drag on the film is the usually compelling Michelle Pfeiffer who phones this one in. She fails absolutely to inhabit the character of the driven lawyer who only takes on Sam's case in order to score points with her co-workers. For a woman as outrageously beautiful as Pfeiffer to deliver a (supposedly) gut-wrenching speech on her many flaws, she'd have had to bring a lot more to the table than she does. It's just not possible to buy her in this part (which is a pity, given her many other, wonderful performances--especially in The Fabulous Baker Boys). That said, Penn and the supporting cast carry this picture with such a depth of commitment that it's possible to ignore the fact that Pfeiffer is outperformed right off the screen. Yes, it's sentimental; yes, it's been done before. But not by Penn, who never fails to bring his all to each role he takes on. This is a feel-good movie with fine performances by Dianne Wiest, Laura Dern, Mary Steenburgen, and the rest of the cast.

A father after 7 years of caring for his child has her taken from him by the State. Why, because he's not fit to raise her because he is mentally handicapped?

1713396,5,B000066HAS,"The film is Oscar material but ignored by the so called Academy Award judges. Sean Penn's acting portrays the typical behavior of a developmentally disabled/autistic person including the waving of the hands, the rocking of the body and the head, togeteher with a speech impediment. The acting by the main protagonists, but especially of Mr. Penn was flawless. Having worked in child welfare in two different states of the union, I found the child welfare laws are unfair to disabled parents when it comes to the custody of their biological children.
The quality of the picture is a big 5, but the dvd has a L.F.E. (Low Frequency Effect) channel which sends a very low frequency response to the rear channels and the subwoofer doesn't work. So, if you experience the lack of sound from the surround speakers and subwoofer, don't go crazy trying (like me)to find the problem. Your receiver should warn you of the Low Frequency Effect. This is a minor problem since the movie doesn't require the sound effect that action packed movies requiere. The sound comes from the center and front channels/speakers and since dialogues are lengthy, the strongest sound comes from the center speaker.

If you are reading this then you know the premise; A retarded (mentally challenged) man fights to keep custody of his adorable daughter, short of sending men with hammers into the theater to smash people's fingers, I can't think of a more obvious tearjerker, so what's wrong with that?  Nothing really, but my problems with this film are that it totally assumes the audience either A.  Knows absolutely nothing about the mentally challenged and how they are treated, at work etc.  B.  Won't care because the performances are so darned good, which they are.  I'm no expert but I used to drive people to and from there jobs who were much like Penns character, and this film as a far far cry from any semblance of reality.  Sam has the mental capacity of a 7 year old, a randy 7 year old we can guess since he fathered a child, this is a problem because we cannot see he has any interest in sex, even the ever gorgeous Michelle Phiefer can't get his attention, sexually.  We are also expected to believe that this man with a heart of gold forced or at least consented to having sex with this homeless women because ""she needed a place to stay"" sadly I am sure this happens all too often, but not this character, Sam would not have wanted to, or forced himself on this women sexually, it just wouldn't happen.  The hospital sends him home with this baby based on the fact that he answered ""yes"" when a nurse says ""are you responsible for this""? Good enough heres your baby, now go, like he was picking up a happy meal.  This is all to set up a scene where he spins around in the street with said baby while Beatles music plays, I love the Beatles and I enjoyed most of the covers (they did not use the originals, I'm sure for financial reasons).  A little of this is OK, but the suspension of disbelief here rivals Dumbo, honestly I would sooner believe an elephant flies then this man who barely makes minimum wage can support himself, provide daycare, Diane Wiest (who seems to be reprising her Jane Grearson role from Little man Tate, a much better film) provides care when the baby is too big to take to work at Starbucks, no I'm not kidding. There are all manor of silly, impossible things, example, he shops for diapers, diapers are expensive, did he just leave the baby at home? But it was funny to watch him fumble with the diapers.  While in foster care Lucy, named for Lucy in the sky with Diamonds, repeatedly leaves the house and wonders with her adorable stuffed animal to the perfect song ""Blackbird,"" wouldn't someone have locked the door or window after the first time? yes of course, but then we wouldn't have the cute jump cuts of sweet Lucy being carried back and forth in front of the 711. But, just like Dumbo, one could have brought a mop and bucket to this film, the tears have not flowed like that since Mrs. Jumbo was paroled, mad elephant indeed!

Everyone else was perfect too, the group of his friends rivaled ""Cookoo's Nest"" and we never saw too many silly courtroom scenes, and there were very few cut out bad guy characters, the unfeeling social worker, the evil family wanting to adopt etc. this script took chances with everything except a semi believable plot.

I was surprised with the depth of Penn's acting; if I didn't know that it was Penn, I would have been convinced that it was one of my many clients (adults with mental retardation). His acting is masterful and respectful.
I did, however, find two flaws in Penn's performance. He says two different things that an actual person with mental retardation would probably never say: one was a sophisticated word, the other a very abstract comment (he tells his attorney that she should leave her husband - that's two layers of abstract thought: talking about someone that's not there, and talking about someone that you have never met that's not there).
I was disappointed that the movie is overly Hollywood and sentimental, but it does what it does well.
If you are familar with the Oscar winning documentary ""The Best Boy"" (1979, Ira Wohl) you'll see that Penn was tremendously influenced by Philly (and Penn has discussed this influence).

The court room exchanges are riveting. Richard Schiff splendidly portrays Turner, the State attorney with the obligation to solely look out for the best interest of the child.  Turner is not a cruel man, but seriously doubts Sam's ability to adequately care for Lucy.  He is compelled to ask the tough questions that cannot be avoided in such circumstances.  Matters later get more complicated as Randy (Laura Dern) becomes Lucy's court appointed foster mother.  Will she eventually take over full custody?  Is there some way that Rita can persuade the court of Sam's minimal competence?
Does it seem that Director Jessie Nelson is pandering to our emotions?  The answer is in the affirmative.  I also thought that the story line was confusing at times. Nonetheless, there's enough meat here to justify seeing this film.  ""I am Sam"" is not a five star production, but it earns a strong four.  Sean Penn is magnificent in this very difficult role.

In this film Sean Penn plays a retarded father to a seven year old daughter whose mental capacity is slowly exceeding his.  Ironically, it's the daughter that leads to the involvement of Child Services in a protracted legal battle for Sean Penn's rights to raise her daughter.
I think the cast was well chosen.  Sean Penn plays the mentally-challenged role very well.  (Hence an Oscar nomination.)  Dakota Fanning did a magnificent job portraying the daughter.  When the camera looks into her eyes, the audience just melts.  Michelle Pfeiffer's bitchy career-driven lawyer act went smoothly.
This film was both sad and touching to me.  Towards the end of the film, Michelle Pfeiffer comments ""I'm afraid I got more out of this than you"" referring to how much Sean Penn has taught her about loving her own child while at the same time knowing his chances of getting his daughter back is slim.

  The film gives a message, that when it comes to parenting, ""love is all you need"" and makes Child Services and the government for that matter, look like bad guys (when in truth, they would most likely be considerate of the situation), but the film is so well done (as far as acting goes) that the film, despite it's depictions of the court system, is believable.

1713422,2,B000066HAS,"""All you need is love."" - John Lennon
This famous quote serves as the focal point for the plot of ""I Am Sam,"" one of the most manipulative tear-jerkers to come out of Hollywood in quite some time. The movie does everything it can to convince its audience that it's mentally handicapped protagonist is perfectly capable of taking care of his 7-year-old daughter because he loves her; of course, common sense says otherwise.
Take Sam's daily events and lifestyle, for example. He works at a Starbucks Coffee establishment, where he makes eight dollars an hour serving beverages and arranging the table packets of sugar in order (strange, isn't it, that everyone in movies can afford nice apartments at crap jobs). The mother of his new daughter, Lucy, is a homeless woman who ""only wanted a place to sleep."" During Lucy's infant years, Sam must ask for advice countless times from his neighbor, who has her own doubts about his ability as a parent.
The movie, of course, uses Sam's retardation as an excuse to apply its morals of love winning over all obstacles. When Lucy is taken away from him after his arrest for unknowingly conversing with a prostitute, he asks for the help of one of the town's top lawyers, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), who offers to take on the case pro bono in her attempt to prove her charitable side to her coworkers. In a series of courtroom showdowns and testimonies that squeeze all the support for Sam the story can get, we are given to accept that, as little Lucy exclaims, ""all you need is love.""
But the opposing side of the courtroom (at least the side we're led to believe as the opposition), makes the better argument. They call into question Sam's ability to care for Lucy in her formative years, as she makes the transition to adulthood, while Rita and Sam spend their spare time concocting speeches about what a loving father he is, and how he can give his daughter the love that no one else can. Even still, this is countered with the question ""If you really love your daughter as you say you do, then don't you believe that she deserves more?"" I'm sorry to say that I agree.
As the movie plods on along its merry way, things go from saccharine to sickeningly sweet. It introduces more characters into the story, ... But the movie, as well as Sam, can't seem to come to grips with the reality of its situation, resorting to treacle and sentiment as a fallback.",1014336000,6,2405,4.621495327102804
1713423,2,B000066HAS,"I know I'm going against just about everyone else who's written their opinions here (excluding that Amazon.com person), but...I found this film shamelessly tactless! Just because a movie can make you cry DOESN'T make it brilliant! I don't know where my unhapiness began with this film, but somewhere early on; very early on.
Was it the herky-jerky camera movements(practically motion sickness inducing), attempting to convey a feeling of ""real life"" that made me dislike the film so? Was it the product placements (Starbuck's, Pizza Hut)that made the film, at times, seem like a VERY LONG commercial? Or was it that the film portrays people with mental disorders as being cute, quaint and funny? Or was it the annoying way ""Sam's"" daughter was so loveable and mature in dealing with her father's illness? It's so hard for me to tell, really, where my dislike for this film begins.
But on a lighter note, I think Sean Penn is perhaps one of the very few great actors of the American cinema working today. I've liked almost (forget ""Shanghai"" and ""Angels"")everything I've seen him in, and he really puts his heart into this role. Unfortunately, he can't save himself from this saccharine mess. Michelle Pfeiffer almost rises above television-type melodrama, but the ""tough girl turns soft"" thing she does is tired, tired, tired. (I DO like the cover version by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn of ""Two Of Us,"" by the way, but that doesn't really save the movie for me.)
Some genius, perhaps the music director of the film, proposed the EXTREMELY risky idea of having popular artists cover Beatles' songs! How ingenious! Is it not common knowledge that just about anyone with ears likes the Beatles? I think that that idea alone completely lacks originality, and almost entirely sums up how I feel about this film.
Please don't think me ""cold-hearted"" or malicious, because I don't think I am. Some of you should pop ""The Bicycle Thief"" or ""Ponette""(for example)into your VCR/DVD player to get a taste of how to artfully and realistically portray sentimentality and pain, while portraying the thoughts and actions of children.
I certainly am not the only person reading this right now who feels his emotions needs to be earned by the filmmaker, am I? This simply feels like a very well done made for tv movie of the week (or is that ""movie FOR the weak""?). Regardless, I expected more from my movie-going experience.

Sean Penn is unbelievable in portraying a man with the mental capacity of a 7 year old, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer who is not use to playing an unlikable character, but of course you learn to love her throughout the film.

1713428,2,B000066HAS,"An examination of the ability of a mentally handicapped adult to raise a mentally normal child seems a fair topic for a ""60 Minutes"" segment but certainly not a 133-minute film. And most definitely not as portrayed in I AM SAM.

Sean Penn plays Sam Dawson, a young man with the mental capacity of a 7-year old, who waits tables at an LA Starbuck's. In the film's opening 10 minutes, Sam rushes off to attend the birth of his daughter, Lucy. The mother, an anonymous homeless woman, deserts Sam and her offspring immediately upon being released from the hospital. Dawson, who loves his child immensely, is left to cope alone. Things go as well as can be expected until the girl turns seven. At that point, it's apparent that Lucy is mentally outstripping Old Dad. After Sam is picked up on Big Brother's radar after a ridiculous incident, his ability to raise his child is called into serious question by the local child protection agency and the court system. To demonstrate to colleagues that she really does have a heart, Dawson's case is taken on pro bono by Rita, a high octane Lawyer-With-An-Attitude played by Michelle Pfeiffer.
Before I rant about all that's wrong with I AM SAM, let me say that I did like Pfeiffer's character. Rita's impassioned outburst on what life is really like for her ""perfect"" self is worth the price of admission. (That I think the actress is a Major Babe and I paid nothing to see the film are irrelevant.) But, beyond that one sparkle ...
Sean Penn does a superb job portraying a man with the mind of a kid. However, the range of the role is so necessarily narrow that his performance becomes monotonous by the end of the film's way too long run time. And, because Sam exhibits no sexual self-awareness or sex drive whatsoever, the fact that he impregnated Lucy's biological mother beggars belief, especially since her only line in the film is her farewell to Sam, ""I only wanted a place to sleep."" I mean, how much encouragement could she have given him to consummate The Act?
Lucy is fetchingly played by the adorable young actress, Dakota Fanning. But since the whole purpose of the script is to arouse the audience to a frenzy of sympathy for the underdog Sam, one wouldn't expect to see an ugly kid.
There's one totally preposterous scene where a ""John"" is busted for soliciting a prostitute without any proposition being made or money changing hands! And this in a city where the working girls advertise on the Web? Oh, please!
But my biggest objection to this unabashed tearjerker is the fact that, in their overwrought desire to whip up viewer compassion for Dawson, the screenwriters totally ignored any scenario that might have given credence to the eminently reasonable position that Sam was indeed too poorly equipped to raise Lucy, and therefore spoil a pre-ordained warm and fuzzy ending. Case in point. Laura Dern plays Randy, a loving and intelligent middle-class woman perfectly suited to be Lucy's foster mother. Even though Randy is married to a man that just might - surprise, surprise! - be capable of being a warm and caring foster father, that possibility is never explored because we never even see the Phantom Hubby except for a brief 10-second shot. The script was weighted in Sam's favor from the very beginning! Gee, let's not spoil a Tinseltown Two-Hankie Event with reality!",1013385600,5,3340,4.768566493955095
1713429,2,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" is one of those films that resemble Frankenstein. Not the movie ""Frankenstein"", but instead a movie made with parts of other movies. I will grant, that in this case, ""Sam"" acknowledges that it is inspired by a couple Hoffman films (take a wild guess what they are).
This is a movie where everyone has a heart of gold; some just don't realize it yet. If only real-life was this convenient!
By now, you should be familiar with the plot, so I won't break that down. The highlights in ""Sam"" are few. One is newcomer Dakota Fanning (Critic's Choice Award winner for Best Child Actor). She lends strong support as Lucy, Sam's 7 year old daughter who is surpassing him intellectually. Another highlight involves, simply, the soundtrack. Beatles songs (although covered by various artists, such as Eddie Vedder) pop up from time to time, because Sam is at least smart enough to realize the Beatles were a great band. The movie's hook line, of course, is ""All You Need Is Love"".
A lot of people want to see Sean Penn recognized for his role as Sam. I say he needs to be recognized for a far-superior film in 2001: The Pledge. The Academy needs to nominate him for Best Director for that extrodinary film. After all, Penn's role of a lifetime came in 1995 for Dead Man Walking.",1013299200,4,1278,4.560869565217391
1713430,4,B000066HAS,"""I Am Sam"" is one of my favorite films of 2001, despite what the critics have been saying. I really don't see how you could truly dislike this film. It's touching, meaningful, insightful, inspiring and boasts one of the best performances if the year by Sean Penn. I left the theater feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. ""I Am Sam"" also had the power to make me reexamine my own life and made me rethink some of my decisions. I learned a lot from ""I Am Sam"", it touched me in a way that not many movies do.

Mental retardation is a tough subject to work. It has often been glamorized or used in cheap ways to add emotion to a story. Director Jessie Nelson handles it beautifully, which makes ""I Am Sam"" a painfully honest and moving film. Mental retardation has never been properly represented, therefore giving many people a slanted view of it. This film changes it all! I went into ""I Am Sam"" expecting a ""sap fest"", if you may, but was pleasantly surprised not to see this.
Simply put, I was blown away by Sean Penn! How often can a Hollywood bad boy pull off a role as a mentally retarded father? Penn didn't just ""pull off"" his role as Sam, he mastered it in the most convincing and heartfelt portrayal of mental retardation to date. Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderful as usual and I also enjoyed seeing Laura Dern again in a small role as Lucy's foster parents. Fans of the Beatles will enjoy the constant references to the band (Sam names his daughter Lucy in honor of the song 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds') as well as the consistency of old Beatles songs being played in the background.",1013212800,,1591,4.448630136986301
