And of course it is past the return date do we just ate the cost. The take away from this is, always check your products as soon as you get them. I have never had a problem in the past and took that for granted.",1523491200,,387,3.911392405063291

8537270,5,B00979KQ1S,"LIke they say, ""OLD IS GOLD"" that is why these 3 action movies will satisfy you if you're into guns, explosives, stealing, and hand-to-hand combat. Awesome movies like these don't come often and when they do on tv, you just wanna watch them over and over again especially if your just plain bored at home. Don't miss out on these old hollywood hits and make your day a big blast.",1389657600,,379,4.428571428571429

8537272,5,B00979KQ1S,"Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal, art thief extraordinaire. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Baker, insurance investigator out to get her man. It is always good to see Sean Connery but he and Zeta-Jones have very little to no chemistry as a team if that was what they were intended to be in a very tired plot line. The film starts off well but their chemistry or relationship is rather strange if one even cares about that aspect. Caper films such as this have been done much better. The preparation scenes for the caper are a bore and look pretty unprofessional for characters who are supposed to be in this line of work. What this film needed was a good director and a good editor as well. The film has a few good scenes thanks to Connery, but the film never reaches its potential. Norman Garwood's Production Designs help a bit while Christopher Young's score is perfunctory. In truth this is could have been a very tired looking production, but Connery's saves it with his great screen presence. BROKEN ARROW is a trip, a powerhouse of nerve raking entertainment. SPEED is outstanding, an overnight classic of the action adventure drama and it is excellent! These are three very good films!",1378598400,,1194,4.7451923076923075
