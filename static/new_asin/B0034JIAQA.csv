8388375,2,B0034JIAQA,We weren't able to watch the 1st disc because it froze at 1min40sec each time we tried to play it. It also had no music or sound although the 2nd disc had sound and they were both supposed to. No idea about the content. Sorry!,1434326400,,226,4.044444444444444

any signage on the film to indicate ""Blackhawk Films"" on it though.  I  did notice on at least one occasion where it looked like
someone was holding or had placed a black card in the foreground to possibly ""hide"" the indian chief that was normally at the bottom of a title card.  I  am not saying that I was able to see their hand.  Someone that remembers all of these little things would even have noticed such a thing. (thats just me).  I  did love it;  and have missed those little sound effects.  A lot of people have discussed in other Chaplin releases that they did not like the little sound effects;  but for me bringing them back makes it fun to
watch in the version that I recall seeing them.  I  am 56 years old and remember getting a film catalog back in the early 1970's;  and ordered regularly 8mm and super 8mm film and later 16mm films of these wonderful classics.  They had the same sound track;  and that is why  I  love these so much.  It is a lot easier to take out a DVD set and watch these instead of the films.  This is a wonderful set;  and very highly recommend purchasing it for your enjoyment.  Picture quality is most likely as good as it is going to get.  Have yourself some fun;  and buy this to show the kiddies,  and step back into an era with NO TELEVISION;  NO CELL PHONES,  ETC.......  A  very good example of times gone by;  and how we got to the present.  All of which you can see the old cars,  the old phones,  etc that were used back in the day.  I  highly recommend this release for your enjoyment.......TOMMY  !!",1395532800,3,1679,4.2025316455696204

Still, these are the versions I'm used to, so I'm very glad and bought the collection. Good starting point for anyone looking to begin exploring the greatest silent filmmaker of all.",1395187200,,401,5.0
