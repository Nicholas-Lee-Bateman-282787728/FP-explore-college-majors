8572087,5,B004UAS7BK,"This is really a remarkable tale, based on a real life presumption regarding the life of a legendary movie star.  Provocative and a bit lurid, it is a depiction of a Hollywood shadow sub culture, but is still based on a human  reality that is much more ignored than understood.  Enlightening to those who pay attention.",1398038400,,319,4.660714285714286
8572088,1,B004UAS7BK,"PLEASE NOTE: This one-star rating applies ONLY to the 2006 DVD which as of this writing is ""currently unavailable"" at Amazon.com. If you want to see this movie, follow this link to the 2010 release, which is infinitely better:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinah-East/dp/B0036264N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinah East</a>. My full, four-star review of the 2010 version, giving details about how to distinguish the two versions, is with that product.

DO NOT buy the DVD listed on THIS page if it ever becomes available again. It is of extremely poor quality, practically unwatchable.",1390608000,,630,6.241379310344827
