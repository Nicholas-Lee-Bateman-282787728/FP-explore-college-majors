3972920,3,B002RD55NK,"Based on the award-winning short film by Shane Acker, the CGI-animated full-length feature film ""9"" intends to expand on its myth and story. Acker himself takes the helm as director in this film co-produced by Tim Burton along with Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted). When I first saw the trailer for ""9"", I was blown away. I tempered my expectations when I went into the theater and did watch the film with an open mind. The film is a visually stunning piece with superb set designs and fluid animation whose style may have been inspired by traditional stop-motion animation.

In unknown time and place, a curious doll-like creature with the number ""9"" (Elijah Wood) on its back awakens to find his supposed creator (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) dead. ""9"" has awakened in a barren world, this world is now a wasteland, destroyed by war; a war waged between humans and machines. ""9"" discovers that he is not alone, stumbling across a similar creature called ""2"" (Martin Landau) who also gets kidnapped by a mechanical monster. ""9"" then discovers that he is a ""stitch punk"" and there are more of his kind being led by ""1"" (Christopher Plummer). ""9"" sets out to rescue ""2"" but instead awakens an evil with the use of a talisman that may doom them all. It is now up to ""9"" and his brethren to try to discover the truth behind their creation....

""9"" is the last created ""stitch punk"" and he is the final piece of the puzzle in the ""9"" mythos. These creatures are miniature creations that resemble a sack held together by either leather strings, metal snaps, buttons, zippers, or shoe strings. They have camera-like eyes and instant access to their innards. The characters in ""9"" are well thought out, # 1 is the supposed leader and the cautious kind--whose sensibilities are all about preservation. # 2 is the explorer and the inventor. # 3 and 4 are twins who are also mute, they keep the history of mankind. # 5 (John C. Reilly) is a healer and a skilled mechanic. # 6 (Crispin Glover) has near-psychic abilities who channels his visions through his drawings. # 7 (Jennifer Connelly) is a warrior and # 8 is the bodyguard of # 1, strong and fierce, yet innocent in a way. # 9 is the curious, selfless protagonist of the film. There is something relevant in the number ""9"", one can say that they are different ""characters"" or potentials of mankind. Acker definitely intended the film to revolve around the creatures in creating this world so full of obstacles that this miniaturized creatures can take advantage of with their size. Acker's keenness and passion for his creations are the film's highlights; the film is a stunning work of visual marvel and storytelling. It is a grand display of idiosyncrasy.

The world that the ""stitch punks"" live in is pretty barren with nothing else left living. While the characters can indeed be enthralling, Acker does lose his way a little in the film's direction. When you think about the plot in ""9""; it makes very little sense. I found it hard to believe that `stitch punks' #'s 1-8 never had the chance to try and figure out their reasons of being. # 7 also points out that there is a battle but none were visible, save one mechanical beast, which was by the way dispatched so easily. No other machines were shown up until the `awakening' was brought into bear. I also found it hard to believe that there are no other surviving `organisms'; war is indeed horror but insects would always survive. Details were left out, giving the viewer several plot gaps to fill in.

The `stitch punks' characterization seem to be presented as they know what to do, but they don't know what and why they are there for. I found hard to buy into the fact that these creatures were designed as the `hope for the future' when they obviously were just contented to exist until events triggered by ""9"" managed to set things in motion. Time (and the passage of) needed to be more specific in the film to give the film's plot needed credibility. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered such as; why did it take so long for ""9"" to come along? How did the professor survive all those years? How many years have passed? The film's final act attempts to explain everything that also gives a sense of the mystical but it doesn't match its past groundwork. If they were meant to reignite the earth, then other things that you factor in such as the `mechanical monster-maker' would serve no purpose (can't discuss without spoiling the movie). The film is all about belief, philosophy and destiny with no viable application or expediency.

The animation-work in ""9"" is nicely executed. The colors, set designs are no means something really groundbreaking but I did appreciate its style. It does convey a mood that matches the film's tone. The film is also quite action-packed that action lovers will no doubt be entertained. The designs of the mechanical beasts were good, they mimic things that can be just freaky. The world of ""9"" is meticulously crafted. The film is a sci-fi mystery until things start to get moving, and the film becomes an actioner with plenty of swift although a bit repetitive movements. ""7's"" moves become redundant after awhile.

""9"" isn't exactly a bad film but the film does feel too short and would have benefited to be much longer. Acker's storytelling had a lot of things going for it, but it just curiously stopped short in its execution and never realizes its journey. The `stitch punks' were involved in a mystery that had some compelling things going for it but they just weren't allowed to move around the depths of its core. Acker does rely too much on theatrics and never allows the viewer for a `nesting` stage to augment the wonder. The film is an average CGI-generated flick that may please those who like special-effects blockbusters but will turn off those who look for an intricate storyline. I appreciate brainless entertainment, but ""9"" pretends to have something deeper and ends up not fulfilling its promise. But ""9"" has its originality and vision. It is conscious that it is mighty eccentric and interesting; too bad the resolution is unsatisfying.

Recommended with caution, Rent it first  [3 Stars= Good, Flawed But with Redeeming Qualities]",1252627200,51,6193,4.727777777777778
3972921,4,B002RD55NK,"""9"" is an astonishing technical achievement, and of that, I think we're all in agreement. Just looking at this film is an experience unto itself; production design, art direction, and visual effects work in harmony to create a bleak but beautiful post apocalyptic landscape of rubble and shadow. The character designs, a combination of burlap and biotechnology, are refreshingly original. As far as spectacle goes, ""9"" is mesmerizing, having the power to draw the audience's attention before engulfing it in a fluid, textural world of imagination and style. While I haven't been too impressed with the process as of late, this is a film that probably should have been released in 3-D, if not for the story, then for the joy of wanting to reach out and feel the surfaces coming off the screen. A lot of work went into creating the look of this film, and it most definitely paid off.

But for everything it achieves aesthetically, ""9"" is ponderous and enigmatic, a story that requires more conjecture than most, I suspect, are willing to apply. This, we may not agree on. We know that it takes place in devastated future, after humanity had lost a war against super intelligent machines of their own creation. We know that humanity is extinct; the only remaining life forms are not really life forms at all, but animate ragdolls with cloth for skin, scopes for eyes, and numbers for names. We know that the latest ragdoll, #9 (voiced by Elijah Wood), has just come to life in the attic of a formerly well-respected scientist, whose lifeless body lies rotting on the floor below. We know that eight other ragdolls are out hidden amongst the rubble of the city, and that a monstrous machine with an animal skull affixed to its head is after them, hoping to find a special talisman with mystical powers.

Most importantly, we know that #9 must convince #s 1 through 8 that there's more to the machine than meets the eye. This puts him at odds with #1 (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who has apparently appointed himself as the leader and rules only through fear. When #2 (voiced by Martin Landau) is kidnapped by the evil machine, for example, #1 would rather let him die and move on rather than try to rescue him. #9 is not wired that way, and the pun is partially intended. Hoping to rescue #2 and discover the truth behind the machine and its ability to suck souls, he relies on the assistance of the one-eyed #5 (voiced by John C. Reilly), the rebellious #7 (voiced by Jennifer Connolly), and the mute #s 3 and 4, identical twins who communicate to each other via shutter-like eye blinks.

We know all this is happening. But really, what's going on in this movie? What is the message that director Shane Acker and writer Pamela Pettler are trying to send? That as long as ragdolls are alive, humanity can continue to exist? There is an explanation for how these dolls were brought to life in the first place, and while it is basically sound, it also raises questions as to the nature of the human soul. The final shot hints at a hopeful future, although I can't help but wonder how such a thing would be possible, seeing as there's nothing biological about a doll made out of cloth, metal, and wood. It has been suggested that life, in the strictest sense, is not dependent on biology, that soul or spirit is immaterial and not bounded by organic matter. Life continuing in the absence of flesh and blood may be the message being sent, but as I already said, this movie requires a lot of conjecture.

I admit that I might have missed something along the way, and if that's the case, I apologize. Even if I failed to see the subtexts in ""9,"" I can still give it credit for getting me to ponder the mysteries of life and what it means to exist. If you choose to think about this film in those terms, it can potentially be the basis for a very stimulating debate. To make things easier on myself, I choose to focus on the film's technical aspects and how wonderfully atmospheric they are. A mood develops the instant the first shot appears, which shows human hands inserting a strand of thread into the eye of a needle. Much later on, after the characters are established, we take a closer look at the artistically prophetic #6 (voiced by Crispin Glover) and realize he's wearing a black and white striped suit, a nod to Tim Burton, one of the film's producers.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me take a moment to address the film's PG-13 rating. While I firmly believe that children in general can tolerate more unpleasantness than adults give them credit for, be aware that some younger audiences may find ""9"" a bit too much to handle, and this is in spite of a running time of less than eighty minutes. Many of the scenes featuring the evil machines are loud and intense, and some may be bothered by the sight of a dead body (even though the face isn't shown). It's an animated film, but there are no cute or cuddly characters, and the comedy relief is used sparingly. And if I had trouble figuring out the story, imagine what it would be like for a six-year-old. Parents: Take heed of the rating and understand that ""9"" was made for older audiences.",1252454400,3,5165,4.567421790722761
3972922,3,B002RD55NK,"It would be easy to dismiss 9 as simply an instance of visual artistry masking an underwhelming post-apocalyptic story; but upon closer inspection, the plot actually only suffers from too many ideas for the truncated runtime. Many of the concepts are clever and new and the elaborate action sequences provide the thrills, though the setting and man vs. machine apocalypse have seen more than their share of incarnations. But what the story lacks in expected profoundness, the generally impressive visual designs more than make up for. All nine ""stitchpunk"" protagonists are memorable and easily distinguishable (the variety of celebrity voices don't hurt), and the enemy machines possess all manner of sharp weaponry and enormous statures. Perhaps the focus on action over origins keeps the excitement from fading, but for a world so full of possibilities, it seems like the answers should have been as exhilarating as the explosions.

""Stitchpunk"" creation 9 (Elijah Wood) awakens to a desolate world ravaged by war. Full of questions, he ventures forth and encounters 2 (Martin Landau), a being like himself, only less complex in design. But before he can learn much about his surroundings or his past, his newfound friend is captured by a gargantuan metal beast and dragged away to a mysterious factory. 9 soon discovers more stitched beings, including the one-eyed 5 (John C. Reilly), the cryptic 6 (Crispin Glover), the battle adept 7 (Jennifer Connelly), the brutish 8 (Fred Tatasciore), the mute twins 3 and 4, and their ominous leader 1 (Christopher Plummer), who rules the group with fear and paranoia. In a hasty attempt to rescue 2, 9 accidentally activates a terrible creation, and must now lead the group on a perilous mission to uncover the secrets of the past in order to save their future.

The blind pursuit of technology brought humankind closer to doom, leaving in its wake the charred remains of civilization and the arrival of tiny, intellectual patchwork puppets. With little more than a couple of sentences to explain the vast, frightening, ""Terminator 2"" post-apocalyptic world, 9 jumps right into the mystery and wonder of deciphering a new existence and fending off mortifying, robotic creatures. Gathering clues about these strange critters and learning about their purpose is half the fun, although with a short runtime and way too much to clarify, the plot suffers from abrupt solutions. The introduction of a mystical talisman, for example, provides a rather unlikely and vague explication for the formidable predicaments.

As with most futuristic and science-fiction films, the setup often requires so much background that either it's left obscure or it envelopes the entire movie. With 9, the setting is dwarfed by the visuals, focusing almost entirely on incredibly creative designs and taught action sequences. The environment is beautiful in its daunting desolation, and the enemies are wickedly crafted from mercilessly sharp, rusty and jagged metal scraps. The nine sack dolls are also inventively pieced together with the oddments of the shattered human race (the remnants of steampunk), and like The Magnificent 9, each serves a unique mental and physical purpose. With fascinating, abrasive visuals, a PG-13 rating and a few scares that are quite intense for younger audiences, 9 confirms the birth of a notably adult computer animated feature.

3972952,1,B002RD55NK,"When I finished the movie, I was actually shocked that Tim Burton actually played a part in making this disaster of a movie. After so many great creations (Coraline, Night Before Christmas, etc), this was an utter waste of time for me and the others who watched it with me. Right of the bat it was confusing and the characters had a lack of connection to the audience. I found it really, really strange how he meets some other random ragdoll and suddenly cares so much about finding him when he's taken by a 'monster'. 9 was some sort of cliche hero who just runs off to save any random dude in danger.

I felt like there were so many plot holes and it was extremely hard to follow what was going on. The ending was just AWFUL, but I guess I'll save that complaint for later.

Of course there's the control freak and his 'body guard' over securing things to 'protect them', and of course 9 and 5 (I believe) run off to go and find 2 (who was taken by a monster in the beginning). I found something - an extremely small error, but something that caught my eye - right when they go into the tunnel after their map flies away. When the map flew, it went right past the tunnel until you couldn't see it anymore, but of course for a dramatic entrance someone finds the map literally RIGHT OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL after it blew away. What the heck. Not only is that a plot hole, but  it was also added simply for the sake of some kind of dramatic-unknown savior to cause some kind of suspense I guess? Not only that, but a monster that they supposedly was sort of portrayed as hard to kill (the control freak had mentioned that if he was taken by the monster he was a goner or something around that) was killed in about two seconds by this new ragdoll.

Okay, pause here. Why is it that the hero who killed it (basically: another ragdoll) suddenly show up at that exact spot? Like I mentioned above, random scenes added just for the sake of the plot.

So anyway, there's this symbol thing, the monster's dead, and 'OH! LETS PUT THIS SYMBOL THING INTO THE CREATION THAT MONSTER WAS TRYING TO MAKE! THAT DOESN'T SOUND DUMB AT ALL!'. -- 9.

Then he awakens the next random monster. It basically goes like this the whole hour; too many action scenes, not enough connection to the audience, rushed plot, and too many plot-holes to count. I feel like random robot-monsters just attacked them so it wouldn't get too boring, which honestly didn't help in the slightest; I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing without nodding off and yawning. There's no emotional connection and the plot is just rushed and weird. It doesn't even make any sense.

I know I mentioned this above, but the characters have no depth. I was hoping it would get better as the movie progressed but I was disappointed. Even the actors voicing it sounded like their voices were flat and forced-- no emotion really at all. Even when they were doing some kind of funeral-like-thing for one of the ragdoll's, the only thing that was considered sad maybe was the music. I mean, 9 barely knew them, and yet he's going to be super-sad if one of them passes away? It really doesn't make any sense.

One more plot hole that stood out more than the others: I'm almost sure there were 3 or 4 robot-monsters they encountered and defeated until the movie ended. In the flashbacks and whatever they saw through one of the twins eyes (I guess he has hologram eyes or something, don't ask me) there were a lot more than just 3 robots, but the movie ends like 'oh, well, that's good enough I guess'. It's also kind of weird how 9 woke up way after the other ones did. I also found it weird how the scientist who was supposedly smart enough to make robots decides to create tiny ragdolls to defeat them?

And then the ending. I cannot even express how disappointed I was. They didn't even save the flipping world. Like really, a bunch of their rag-doll friends die and they know exactly what to do to 'release' them or something like that. And how they release them is flat-out retarded; and then as they're standing around the worlds rubble, with only four of the rag-dolls left, they of course have to end it there like it was a really heartwarming moment and add some closure words. I believe it was something around the lines of, 'This is our world now. We can to whatever we want'. Or something like that. So, basically, total disappointment, literally no emotional connection to the audience, plot holes, awful ending, too many action scenes, random things that happen for the sake of the plot, etc. The only thing I can say that I liked about the movie was the animation. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend.",1510963200,,4664,4.445614035087719

  This movie is a tour de force in computer animation. It is visually mesmerizing, and aurally stunning  and, its first sixty-eight, or so, minutes feature some excellent story telling. Unfortunately, it is a great (or, nearly so) movie that is saddled with a fairly crappy ending  still, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.85:1  Color  1080p  VC-1 (35.4 Mbps)

  This movie features images that are very sharp, that have great apparent depth, and that have excellent shadow detail  and, they also possess a muted (though, still vibrant) color-palette that works very well with the tone of the source material. Fine detail is readily visible in all of the close-ups of faces, clothing, furnishings and machines  without any apparent edge-enhancement. Also, while there is some very mild banding on rare occasions, there are no other anomalies to mar the image. Overall, this movie's picture quality is excellent  and, it should satisfy the VAST majority of viewers.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  If this soundtrack was a 7.1 mix I would rate it a 5+ for sound quality without hesitation  as it is, it is still one of the VERY best sounding audio presentations that you will EVER hear on a home theater system regardless of the number of channels. It features very deep bass (in not just the subwoofer, but in ALL channels), very active and highly directional surround channels, clear well-placed dialog, ambient sounds that effectively convey the location of the on-screen setting, and well recorded music. Overall, the sound presentation for this movie should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest of listeners.

3973182,4,B002RD55NK,"After watching videos on horrible animated films, I decided I needed to cleanse my palate with a list of lesser-known good animated films and this one was on only one of those lists. I consider myself a fan of Tim Burton's work, yet I'd never heard of this particular title. Once I got over my shame, I read a summary of the film and immediately ordered it (this review may contain spoilers).

As far as I can tell, this film has an original plot, which makes it a diamond in the rough immediately nestled among the remakes and adaptations. The story is about machines that have become sentient when our technological advances become too powerful and said machines turn on humankind. The scientist who created the main war machine infuses small dolls with pieces of his soul in order for life to carry on (and possibly begin again) once the humans have been wiped out entirely. Why this apparently intelligent scientist thought it would be good to place the fate of life itself on FLAMMABLE rag dolls in a world ravaged by war and robots that can blow things up is beyond me.

Anyway, we meet the main protagonist named ""9"" right away and are slowly introduced to the other eight dolls, some of whom die before we can really develop much of an attachment to them. You learn that doll ""1"" has gathered up some of the other dolls and kept them safe inside an old church - the old, set-in-his-ways character who isn't very open to change or breaking routine. So, of course, 9 shows up and wants to change everything (with good intentions) in order to learn more about why he's there at all, leading to chaos and the loss of some of the dolls' lives (which 9 acknowledges as his fault later on). We meet what we think is the villain, but then it gets killed by another doll in a single swipe like it's no big deal. Then, 9 accidentally activates a much larger machine (known just as ""The Machine"") that turns out to be the real enemy using this little trinket that he found when he came to life. The Machine also proceeds to eat the souls of some of the other dolls. Eventually, 9 learns that he has to rip the trinket back out of The Machine and then blast it with said trinket in order to destroy it and free the souls of his fallen comrades. The film ends with 9, the female character 7 and the two non-verbal characters surviving (and the other five dying by getting their souls literally sucked out of them by The Machine). There also seems to be an implied romance between 9 and 7 at the end, but there is absolutely NO hinting at it until the very end when they hold hands. I'm all for subtlety, but if there was supposed to be romance brewing between characters, it'd be nice to get a tiny hint.

I do have a few problems with this movie, namely that a lot of things didn't really get explained. When did the movie take place? In the bonus features, it was explained that the film was sort of a combination of 1920s-1940s America as if the Industrial Revolution had never ended. Why was The Machine programmed to steal the souls of the main characters? Were they meant to be its life force, or did it just kill them because they were there? The scientist that created The Machine and mentions that it lacked a soul, so was it consuming the souls of the dolls in an attempt to gain a soul of its own? Why didn't it just kill the scientist and take his entire soul, if that was the case? Why was the trinket so pivotal to the release of the dolls' souls after The Machine had been blown up? I wanted to know more about why this little gadget was so important and why it had such a reliance and effect on souls.

In a similar vein, why did The Machine even bother going after the dolls since they weren't exactly living things in a typical sense? The dolls survived the chemical annihilation of the humans due to not being biological creatures, so would they even register as a threat to The Machine (well, Machines - in a flashback, we see the dolls being attacked by a whole army of Machines)? Why was the gizmo that turned The Machine on something that could also destroy it? Was it intentionally created that way by the scientist when he realized The Machine was going to kill everyone, sort of as a last-ditch means of stopping it? If not, why did The Machine need this trinket to work at all? If this trinket could awaken and destroy the thing, why not just destroy the trinket so The Machine is never awakened again? Again, not explained. Were these dolls supposed to live forever or did they have life spans (as in if they hadn't been killed)? If human souls can't die, then does that mean the only way to take the lives of these dolls was to remove its soul? If each doll was meant to represent a different part of the human soul, then what was going to happen after 1 intentionally sent 2 outside to die because he was ""too old?"" 1 does go on to say that sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many, but what good was going to come out of throwing 2 to the wolves (err, robots)? If each doll represented a different part of a human being, could life be expected to go on with pieces missing? Wouldn't all dolls need to survive in order to make up a complete soul and begin the cycle of life anew? How did these dolls even come to life to begin with? How were they meant to restart life?

Also, I kind of thought it was pointless to switch antagonists about a third of the way into the film; originally, something called ""The Beast"" posed the biggest threat to the dolls, but after it was killed in one hit by 7, it didn't really seem all that threatening (but then it was replaced by The Machine). My last issue with the movie was the fact that some of the characters that survive at the end of the film are some of the ones the audience becomes the least attached to. I have no problem with main characters dying because it makes for a delightfully dramatic and effective scene, but I would have liked to see some of the other characters live a little longer and maybe killing off the secondary ones instead. Given how many characters died, we definitely get the idea that The Machine is a major threat and not to be trifled with.

Aside from all that complaining that I just did, I still really liked this film. It was original, the characters were creatively designed and, as with any Burton animated film, it was a gorgeous visual experience. With such small main characters to follow around, there were plenty of beautiful and interesting perspectives in this post-apocalyptic WWII setting. Some of the imagery was pretty creepy too, like one of The Machine's creations using 2's dead body as a puppet to get the others to let their guard down in order to hypnotize and capture them, and of course the times when you see the dolls getting killed. I also like that the dead characters didn't magically come back to life after they were set free - I figured that's the turn the movie would have taken. But nope, they stayed dead - their souls were just freed. The characters themselves are all about as well-developed as you can expect considering how little time we get to know them because there are so many we meet in rapid succession, which is still not too bad.

Finally, this is NOT a movie for kids or a cushy feel-good movie where everybody wins. It's a very dark and grim film where several characters die and while it does sort of end on a positive note, it also ends with uncertainty because the remaining dolls don't know what will happen next or what they have to do. I would've like to see more put into fleshing out the story and tying up the loose ends. I also think they should have stuck with one main antagonist instead of making us think the major threat was the cat machine thing for a while. Seems like the creators were so excited to tell their story in a set amount of time that they left out a lot of pivotal details. I would've been totally fine with an extra half an hour tacked onto this film if it meant more clarity. Still, I'd recommend it. In spite of its flaws, ""9"" is a pretty good philosophical sci-fi/action film with stunningly dark imagery.",1472256000,,8102,4.382978723404255

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The film 9 is a time in the too-near future. An animated future dystopia that is powered and enabled by the invention known as the Great Machine in which the world's machines have turned on mankind and sparked social unrest, decimating the human population before being largely shut down. But as our world fell to pieces, a mission began to salvage the legacy of civilization; a group of small creations was given the spark of life by a scientist in the final days of humanity, and they continue to exist post-apocalypse. With their group so few, these ""stitchpunk"" creations must summon individual strengths well beyond their own proportions in order to outwit and fight against still-functioning machines, one of which is a marauding mechanised beast.

In the film 9, just before the Scientist dies, we see an introduction and explanation from the Scientist who tells us his words and creates 9 and the film now starts when the rope that held the rag doll 9 finally snaps, and 9 falls to the desk including the talisman. 9 starts to look at his surroundings and finds the talisman, he briefly sees the Scientist lying dead on the floor covered in papers which shocks him. 9 then looks out the window and sees that the world has been left in total ruins and looking at the total wasteland of the Nation, 9 sees something moving and tries to call it but finds out that he can't speak.

9 discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, who is a beginner; a person who is new to a subject, skill, or belief, despite this 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilisation may depend on them. All humans are gone, and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction.

Story wise, into this post-apocalyptic universe enters the title character 9 [voiced by Elijah Woods], a living puppet made of cloth, armatures, a bit of science, and some interesting Eastern European alchemy. At his birth 9 doesnt truly know what, if any purpose he has. Its only when he meets the others who were built like him, particularly 2 [Martin Landau] gives him a tune-up, and 9 begins asking questions and 5 [John C. Reilly] that he starts developing his own reason for his existence and fans of any decent science fiction will be figuring out what it is. And one of the virtues of this 9 animated film, compared to its shorter predecessor animated film, both were directed by Shane Acker, who wrote the feature with Pamela Pettler, that does not rush towards any answers. Instead it lingers in a strange, sinister and brilliantly realised virtual landscape that is rich with allusions to the histories of painting, animation, fantastic literature and 20th-century totalitarianism.

With this animated film 9 that was directed by Shane Acker, well the big question has been asked whether it is a good animated film or not? Also whether audiences around the world were ready for this very audacious directorial debut and thought provoking animated film? Well to me the answer is a massive yes, as it is a totally fantastic unique animated film that fills your image with wonder, as well as amazing computer animation. The story behind the making of 9 is interesting in its own right, especially with Steve Acker was slowly climbing up the animation ladder thanks in large part to the three shorts he created, The Hangnail [1999], The Astounding Talents of Mr. Grenade [2003] and finally, a short version of 9 [2005] that earned Shane Acker an Oscar nomination.

They say 9 was heavily influenced by stop motion surrealists Jan Svankmayer and the Brothers Quay, the cohesive plotting of the Academy Award nomination caught the attention of no less than director/producer Tim Burton. From there on, Tim Burton brought in the Russian maverick director Timur Bekmambatov, who is a Russian-Kazakh film director known for vampire franchise who produced Night Watch [2004], Daywatch [2006] and Wanted [2008] and those films convinced Focus Features to finance a full-length 9 animated film feature and after a four and half years production of a gruelling schedule, we can now view the fruits of his endeavours.

Visually, 9 has to be the most stunning experience ever produced in the animated film world ever since the first Toy Story. That does not mean in that cute and fuzzy scenario department either. Instead 9 is as revolutionary a tour de force as Toy Story was in 1995. Combining two well-worn, endlessly fertile science fiction conceits, such as the post-apocalyptic planet and the sensitive machine and Shane Acker has made a parable of technological peril that is both exciting and satisfyingly enigmatic. Though he uses the latest computer-assisted techniques, his aesthetic has a pleasingly creaky, handmade feel, as if his main tools were not a mouse and a keyboard but rather a needle and thread.

Shane Acker has visual signatures of Jan vankmajer, a Czech filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media, the Brothers Quays [Stephen and Timothy Quay], Ji' Trnka the Czech puppet-maker, illustrator, motion-picture animator and film director and all those highly Eastern Euro-influenced stop motion masters and successfully translated them into CGI. Adding in his own personal tastes, especially the Wachowskis [Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski] and other masters of post-apocalyptic settings, the film carries its own gritty integrity while adding the flawless movement of well-rendered CGI. In plain English, the wow factor of this animated film's graphics and sequences are truly off the meter. Every time you think Shane Acker cant do any better, and Steve Acker succeeds in topping himself again, again and again.

This still leaves the question though of how Americans reacted to this animated film, as I have not heard any sort of review or comment on the animated film alone and only came upon this Blu-ray by accident and cannot understand why it has taken me this long to find out about this animated film. Quite frankly, I suspect it probably was a huge hit in Europe, especially where Shane Ackers aforementioned influences of the highly Eastern Euro-influenced stop motion that Shane Acker revered like a minor saints and I suspect and not surprised that I suspect it did very well in Japan, which has its share of successful stop-motion mavericks such as Kihachiro Kawamoto. Even in Canada, which reveres Norman McLaren, probably equally praised this animated film.

But one thing has to be said that in America that the unfortunate truth is, that by American standards, 9 is graphically at least five years ahead of its time, a circumstance Tim Burton should already be quite familiar with this. After all, Tim Burton produced Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride, which were two animated films which only earned acceptance years after their original release. And when it comes to Shane Ackers feature-length debut, it should be filed along with those two Tim Burton animated films as well as The Iron Giant.

9 and his brethren, is seen scuttling through bombed-out buildings like partisans in an occupied city, evading predatory bird- and spiderlike foes and quarrelling among themselves, also try to piece together their own history. Their inquiry is both metaphysical and who made them, and practical: what are they made of, and how does it work and why? Answers are parcelled out in quieter moments and in vivid rushes of imagery that punctuate the fights and flights.

The action scenes are breathless and intense, the ravenous villains are frightening to behold, and the overall mood is probably too dark and anxious for very young children. But every effort to expand the range of feature-length animation beyond the confines of cautious family fare is to be welcomed, and budding techno and fantasy geeks are likely to be intrigued and enthralled by the whole of the very inventive animated film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Studios Home Entertainment delivers us a totally spectacular high-definition 1080p encoded presentation that is on par with Henry Selick's CORALINE animated 3d film. They have given us the blend of computer-generated animation and stop-motion work through a real stunning brilliant Blu-ray disc and despite being in 2D; you sometimes get the impression of a 3D dimensional side of things. We also get sublimely detailed and rich offering of complete CGI material and Shane Acker's vision is densely textured, both in the character models and the surrounding environment, and Universal's image replicate every ounce of its beauty. While the animated film is bathed in browns and blacks, the giant red eye of The Machine leaps off the screen in stunning clarity. Speaking of clarity, fine detail is pumped up to maximum, rivalling any of the recent releases by PIXAR Animation Studios. The stitching and the crosshatch of the puppets are always discernible; they are also very precise and very clear. At one point in the film a very, very slight bit of aliasing can be detected around The Machine. Other than that, this is a top notch Blu-ray video presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Studios Home Entertainment brings you a totally rich and superb 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound experience, especially as it is a very active action-adventure animated film, filled with tons of clanking metal, roaring from the mechanical beast, and plenty of boisterous low-end rumbling from a slew of different sources. All of that thunders throughout the sound track with firm captivation, keeping deep blasts of sound from pounding too hard and low-to-mid effects both crisp and mindful of the treble-bass balance. There's a wealth of delicate distanced effects present in the sublime sound design that are preserved elegantly here, like graceful incorporation of Deborah Lurie's original music and ambient sound effects like wind and dust. On top of all that, you get to hear every ounce of the star-studded dialogue with some stunning clarity as the track, that is brilliantly clear and definitely a terrific environmental sound design that gives all of your speakers a good workout and will impress any guests you invite to view this brilliant animated film and if you want to show someone what high definition bass sounds like, then this Blu-ray disc will really impress them.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Feature Commentary with Writer/Director Shane Acker, Animation Director Joe Ksander, Head of Story Ryan O'Loughlin and Editor Nick Kenway: Here we are welcomed to the very informed Directors Commentary by the following people that includes Shane Acker [Director], Joe Ksander [Animator Director], Ryan O'Loughlin [Head of Story] and Nick Kenway [Editor]. They all comment about the tome of the music to enhance the mysterious atmosphere of the animated film, especially while the character 9 is being created and of course we see the world through the eyes of 9 and of course discovering who 9 is as we follow his adventure in this virtual devastated world. They all agree that they felt it had to have a European scenario setting of a destroyed city particular in Vienna at the end of the Second World War. When 9 meets the other rag dolls, the crew talk about each of the characters that are left and what their numbers mean, especially towards their specific characters and foible personality. They all have a very good chemistry together, and the conversation rarely slow down as some audio commentaries can seem to do at times. Shane Acker is always excited to discuss parts of the production, and seeing his short film turned into a feature-length animated film. Shane Acker and the other contributors are always persistent, enthusiastic, and highly enlightening on both the process of building the animation and the shading and lighting image qualities of the animated film. It talks about the action sequences, realism behind the mechanised creatures, and historical reflection on the design of the animated film. They also talk about the clouds a lot and how they were produced. But with some of their comments it went slightly over my head with so much detail, but despite this I really enjoyed all their enthusiastic comments and you really get the impression they really enjoyed the project, I do hope there is a follow up animated film, especially with the rain drops suspended in the air, as they sort of hinted they might see what comes from the rain drops. So all in all a great audio commentary, give it a whirl and enjoy.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:24] Here you get a selection of Five deleted scenes that are entitled The Truth Revealed; Throw Me the End of Your Rope; The Fall Out; Taking the Offensive and The Scientists Legacy. They are not comprised of finalised polished up animation, because for the most part they are just storyboards that are partially animated. You can as usual watch each one individually or Play All.

Special Feature: 9  The Long and Short of It [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [16:28]  You get to see the original 9 animated short that Shane Acker [Director] created as his thesis project in the film school at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] and explains his thoughts about the creation of his animated film and especially learning about 3D animation. Tim Burton saw the animated short and was immediately interested in producing a full-length animated film version. This film is full of imaginative creativity, and is just as exciting to watch as the feature itself. There is no dialogue here, but none is needed. Shane Acker has such deep admiration for the original short that it is really great fun to hear him talk about it and the passion he felt for making the animated film. We also get very nice insightful and in-depth input on how the animated film 9 came into fruition, especially from the following contributors and they are Kristin Solid [Supervising Animator]; Elijah Wood [Voice of 9]; Jim Lemley [Producer] who is an is an American film and television producer based in Paris and best known for his work on the hit action-thriller film Wanted; Pamela Pettler [Screenwriter] and her credits include the stop motion films Monster House, Corpse Bride and 9; Jennifer Connelly [Voice of 7]; Timur Bekmambetov who is a Kazakh director, producer and screenwriter who has worked on films, music videos and commercials; Tim Burton [Producer]; Crispin Glover [Voice of 6]; Martin Landau [Voice of 2]; Regina Conroy [Story Artist]; Joe Ksander [Animation Director]; Robert J. St. Pierre [Production Designer]; Ryan OLoughlin [Head of Story]; and Jeff Bell [Visual Effects Supervisor: Starz Animation]. All in all this is a really nice feature documentary and what was so nice is how everyone really enjoyed working on the animated film 9 and especially working with Shane Acker who they felt was such a really nice person and especially a very inventive person to work with, who inspired everyone to work their heart out on producing this ground breaking animated film.

Special Feature: On Tour with Shane Acker [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:36] Here we get to explore with Shane Acker [Director] a quick tour around the STARZ Animation Studio in Toronto who gives us an insight into the world of visual storytelling, through design, through colour and texture, while at the same time gives us a brief and brilliant tour of the different departments that worked on the animated film 9. It really is amazing to see how many people it took to make the animated film '9,' when it only took Shane Acker and no one else to make his first original animated short. First up we get to visit the Editorial Department and we get to meet Nick Kenway [Editor] where we find him working on his computer and where a lot of work was done on producing the animated film 9. Next stop on the tour is the Art Department, where all the ideas of the script and try to figure out how to transfer all this into the animated film. Next stop on the tour is the Modelling Department, where they create the characters and the virtual world via their computer. Next stop on the tour is the Animation Department, where after they have designed the characters and the modelling, it then ends up in another particular department, especially the motivations for how the characters should be and react to certain situations, plus getting the audio tracks done for the actors to perform for their part in the animated film, but most importantly the talented computer animators are there to create the action and the emotions of the characters and there we see Kristin Solid [Supervising Animator] working at her computer. Next stop on the tour we find ourselves in the Layout Department and this is where the cinematography takes place and they use the storyboard drawings as a basis, to eventually enhancing the finished 3D frames of the virtual world for the animated film. Next stop on the tour we are in the Effects Department where they create the virtual world to great enhancement and here we meet Warren Lawtey [Visual Effects Supervisor] where they discuss some aspect of a visual explosion on a computer screen. Next stop on the tour is the Lighting and Composition Department; this is where the final stages of the animated film is tweaked to enhance the animated film and here we meet Anna Wagner-Lopez [Lighting and Composition Lead] here we find her discussing a scene on computer screen with Shane Acker. So ends this quick tour of STARZ Animation Studio in Toronto and Shane Acker says that he hopes you have enjoyed the tour. Well I certainly did and was so informative and fascinating in-depth look into the mechanical aspect on how they made the full length 9 animated film.

Special Feature: The Look of 9 [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:12] Here is another nice featurette that mainly sticks to the unusual aesthetics of '9.' From character design to the feel of the world after war, it's all covered here. Here once again we meet Shane Acker [Director] where we get an in-depth look at all the characters in the animated film and especially a detail look at the virtual parallel world that 9 inhabits. We also get to meet the people behind-the-scene involved in working on the animated film, and they are Elijah Wood [Voice of 9]; Timur Bekmambetov [Producer]; Robert J. St. Pierre [Production Designer]; Pamela Pettler [Screenwriter]; Jim Lemley [Film Producer], Ryan OLoughlin [Head of Story]; Matthew Teevan [Head of Production]; Charles Bonifacio [Supervising Animator]; Kevin R. Adams [Art Director/Director of Photography]; Regina Conroy [Story Artist]; Christophe Vacher [Art Director]; Morgan Ginsberg [Supervising Animator]; Joe Ksander [Supervising Animator]; Adam Beck [Supervising Animator]; David Baas [Animation Department Head]; Daryl Graham [Supervising Animator] and Tim Burton [Producer]. Here once again we get another fascinating insight into the making of the brilliant animated film 9 and of course hearing from Shame Acker [Director] and all the talented people at STARZ Animation Studio in Toronto, who inform us why they loved working on this very creative animated film.

Special Feature: Acting Out [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:54] The animation department talks about what it is like creating emotional and communicative performances with these odd characters. Once again we see behind-the-scene of what went on in producing the animated film 9 and all the dedicated that felt privilege in working for the STARZ Animation Studio in Toronto and the contributors involved in producing the modelling and texture for the animation characters are Joe Ksander [Animation Director]; David Baas [Animation Department Head]; Adam Beck [Supervising Animator]; Shane Acker [Director]; Charles Bonifacio [Supervising Animator]; Daryl Graham [Supervising Animator]; Kristin Solid [Supervising Animator] and Julien Soret [Animator].

Special Feature: 9  The Original Short [2005] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:32] See how 9 made its first step as an animated film short, and then became a full-scale film production. This is an insightful and thoughtful featurette that takes us through what it was like taking just over 10 minute animated short and eventually creating a full-length animated film from it. The animated short film took four and a half years, on and off, to create and Shane Acker definitely paid homage and great influence to the Brothers Quay and PIXAR animation. Originally Shane Acker wanted to make it as stop motion, but then went for CGI when realising it would have turned out to be far too expensive. The music was provided by Eric Olsen and his band the Earganic. Here we get to view the brilliant Shame Acker original animated short 9 [2005] and as a bonus you can either view it with the very informative audio commentary by Shane Acker [Writer/Director/Animator] and Joe Ksander [Animation Director] or you can also view it without the audio commentary, but I chose to view it with the first option, as it was really good to hear the very informative audio commentary and is also good to hear the views of the two people explaining the whole concept of this totally brilliant animated short and of course eventually 9 went onto an even more spectacular full length animated film. Finally, it garnered loads of Awards, which included Student Academy Award: Gold Award for Animation. SIGGRAPH: Best in Show. Animex: First Prize, 3D Character Animation. Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation College Awards: First Prize, Non-traditional Animation. Florida Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival: Best Animated Short.

Special Feature: My Scenes: The My Scenes feature is only available while the animated film is playing.

Special Feature: U-Control Picture-in-Picture Experience: This picture-in-picture track is one of the better Universal U-Controls Experiences out there. There's a wealth of information about the film, cast, and crew here. Interviews with the cast and crew pop up on a regular basis to offer educational and enlightening titbits about the film.

I really loved this animated film and the spectacular audio and video only help solidify this as a highly recommended title that can, for the most part, it can be used as an audio demonstration material from your home theatre setup. It's hard not to go into Shane Acker's 9 with a lot of enthusiasm, especially when two very creative minds Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov headline the production crew. 9 animated feature film is a totally beautiful intelligent artistic piece, that has been very well thought out as a thrilling tour de force adventure, and it is a very satisfying experience. Very Highly Recommended!

The doll in charge is obviously patterned after a Catholic pontiff accustomed to reigning with an iron fist and impeding his subjects from finding true enlightenment and reaching their full potential.

That said, I would add that, although my wife found this movie unbearably boring, I found it immensely entertaining and intriguing.

I would recommend this film only to the young (at heart as well as chronologically), and/or those who enjoy contemplating deep dark issues such as religion and spirituality with an open mind.",1467158400,,606,5.237113402061856

This is not your standard Disney animation or story but I would recommend it for almost any age. It is a bit of a dark story but it's so beautifully told that I think that children would appreciate it and perhaps learn a little moral lesson. I love this film.,1464220800,2,528,4.237623762376238

The scene where all of them are running from the Machine across the bridge trying escape but the collapsed but right before 7 was about to attempt to destroy the Machine 6 said ""no you mustn't destroy it there trapped there trapped inside you can't destroy it then that's bursted up from beneath the bridge and 6 ended up getting caught by the Machine. Just as his soul is about to taken he say's ""go back you must go back to the first room to where it all began the answer is there"" then he dies.

I realize it is hard to have a totally coherent time line and development ( I don't know how to enunciate this), in a movie, but I wonder about some of it.  Just a little disconnected. BUT the main thing in viewing fantasy is, after all, suspension of disbelief. I did dive right in to 9's world; the questions come up with the 2nd, 3rd, 4th (you get the idea) viewings.

3973491,4,B002RD55NK,"The world of the film, 9 is a bleak and desolate one.  It is one in which all the life, hope and empathy that humanity at it's best has to offer is at it's best nonexistent.  It is a world that is a barren wasteland and the spark of life has dimmed.  In which life is reduced down to survival and everything else becomes secondary.

 In a future where mankind has destroyed itself through technology, irresponsibility and deception.  Before his death, a lone scientist imparts nine elements of himself into nine rag dolls.  The nine dolls band together in an act of survival.  They attempt to make a life together though a series of events occurs that forces the youngest to confront the oldest doll in a conflict of values.

 As the story progresses the audience is exposed to the facts of the demise of the world of humanity.  They are shown that it is through humanity's arrogance that an artificial intelligence was built and that humanity had an inability to respect their creation and to coexist with it.  While this is a plot setup that has been done in other films, 9 does it in a unique way.

 It is through the struggles of the rag dolls within their world that we learn that those that come before us do not always prepare us for the life that we face.  The world that anybody comes to live in is predetermined by those that came before and it is up to those descendants to reclaim the world in a manner that honors the spirit intended.

 This goal is not easily accomplished and usually needs sacrifice.  It is a goal that requires groups of people to band together and find a way to be better than each one individually.  Only then can the sins of the fathers be put right and allow life to flourish once more.",1440374400,,1723,4.3955696202531644

3973595,4,B002RD55NK,"A visually stunning but incredibly grim animated feature that extols the virtues of peace by depicting the ravages of war.  This is a treatise against squandering our gifts.  A lesson against technological advancements, which are not always in our best interest.  The story concerns a scientist (voice by Alan Oppenheimer, cousin of scientist Robert Oppenheimer.....the father of the atomic bomb), who soon finds his invention of a thinking robot used for nefarious means resulting in the annihilation of the human race.  Before he expires, this scientist creates nine homunculus-like rag dolls (Stitchpunks) as a penance of sorts.  The overly curious nature of his last creation, dubbed 9, results in catastrophe and death.  This is not a happy tale.  It's also not a very original one; it's obvious that more time and money was spent on the artistry, much less on developing a more complex story.  Still, it's not without a certain amount of excitement.  The ragtag homemade monsters are especially cool.  But it's definitely not a cartoon meant for children.",1427155200,8,1061,5.188235294117647

I am so glad this wasn't just another Disney/PIXAR type of life is happy all the time, just for kids animation films (and yeah, I know it's not a Disney movie), but I guess the PG-13 rating was a good indication of this.

3973865,3,B002RD55NK,"Really torn on this one.  The visuals are beautiful, and the creativity/idea/originality is top-notch.  However, the character development and narrative are somewhat lacking.  I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the movie is about nine Pinocchio/rag-doll-esque creations trying to make their way in a scary post-apocalyptic world.  The movie purports to explain the puppets' creation and purpose, it just doesn't do so very well, and by the end, it raises more questions than it answers.  It's by no means a waste of time, and it's worth watching for the visuals alone, but they could have done so much more with it.  It's one of the few films that actually could have done with being 30 minutes longer.",1405209600,,708,5.0085470085470085

After watching it, yes, it has moments in there that are more intense than a Disney film but for children that have already seen Coraline, Nightmare Before Christmas or any other Tim Burton movie, this is just another film they will fall in love with.

3973916,5,B002RD55NK,"With all the sugary kiddies animated films that have graced the silver screen over the past 70 plus years, it's more than a little refreshing to come across an animated film like 9. Produced by Tim Burton(..and a few others), the film certainly has the look of something Burton would have his hands in. This film is NOT FOR CHILDREN and is really quite dark and scary at times. The story is very straightforward and the animation is really excellent even if the color palette is muted and dark, the design of the creatures is top notch with a haunting quality(one of Burton's signature attributes).

9 is probably one of the best animated films in many years and while it was overshadowed by the likes of WALL E and UP, it isn't any less impressive. Put the kids to bed and give this one a shot, its really a great film.",1399507200,,820,4.430463576158941
3973917,5,B002RD55NK,"This is a dark computer animated film that I saw when it first came out. I assume it is CGI, but perhaps it is stop motion animation. At any rate, it is unique, it is different, it is as far from a disney cartoon as possible. Made by Starz Animation and Relativity Media, distributed by Focus Features. Stars the voices of Elijah Wood, Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Connelly, and several others. It is a post-apocalyptic world in which all humans are dead, destroyed by the machines that turned on their creators the humans. Oh, those foolish Humans! It is far darker and far more original than ""Astro Boy"" and others that try to deal with a war-devastated future. It shows that Shane Acker is a truly original visionary.
  Though dark, there is much hope in the end. The idea of burlap dolls with movement and intelligence -- and souls that can be resurrected to go on to Heaven is daring and unusual for a film. Do robots have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Here a scientist transfers parts of his soul into tiny robots wrapped in burlap. And they alone survive along with a war machine that tries to destroy and assimilate  their souls. The idea that in the end humans are finished and only robots survive is not new. ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" had that idea, too. But here the tiny robots are more sympathetic and they spend the time running around in a ruined landscape trying to figure out who they are, at the same time rescuing their comrades and destroying the Machine. It is an anti-war film. It is also Steampunk in that the architecture, vehicles, pictures, etc., resemble the 1930s. Art Deco factories, for instance. But it is the SF element of future robotics, soul transfer by mechanical means, and robots that live and think for themselves that are the chief motifs of the film. There is no slick, streamlined architecture of the stereotypical SF film. All the backgrounds are of bombed out, ruined Europe, circa 1918.
  Acker doesn't play it safe. This is an alternate history of what might have happened in WWI that never ended until all humans were exterminated. A fascinating idea,
  The characters are warm and approachable, aspects of a single mind: their creator-scientist. Some are grumpy authoritarian types, others open-minded inquiring types, others all action and cunning, others mute and autistic yet genius, others inventive tinkerers, etc. All aspects of one human soul.
  An adventure film in a gigantic bombed out ruined city, a quest, with anachronistic gadgets, seemingly homemade and improvised. Very different from the slick SF films of the usual variety. This is a film that marches off to its own path and refuses to be a cliche of the SF genre. War film, horror film, sci-fi film, adventure fantasy -- steampunk.
  In the 5 extra feature documentaries nobody mentions steampunk, but it is a steampunk film. And a wonderful one. Includes original student film short, deleted scenes, and several documentaries of interviews and explanations of how it was made and what its theme is.",1399420800,,3053,4.874517374517374

One of the few criticisms I have is the dialogue. A lot of it seems silly and canned (""You musn't!"" and ""That is what holds the answer!"") but not enough for me to bump it down a star.

I wasn't a big fan of how they used the two characters as an allegory for religion.  It was like they had an idea and then didn't want to offend anyone, so they scaled it back.  It didn't seem to add much to the characters, so I wish they'd either left it out or gone further with it so that the characters felt like they'd made more of a change.

3974044,4,B002RD55NK,"I ordered this movie because a friend of my son's had recommended it. Even the mom said it was a worthy film. I watched it for the first time with my son. I found the story a bit jarring and political at times. The idea of death is very forward in presentation throughout the cartoon. My son, who is not yet twelve, was eager to assure me that the sad parts were over quickly. It was quite a role reversal for him to reassure me rather than the opposite.
The film tells the story of nine creatures- or creations if you will. I don't want to spoil the story, but it is a kind of apocalyptic tale in which there are no humans, only creations who are left to deal with the aftermath of what scientists and war have wrought on the world. There are thematic elements that are very adult running parallel to the action within the story. There is a sense of preservation, a thread of foreboding and an all-out sense of hope in the tale that you cannot help but root for these tiny creatures to succeed. They are battling not only their own fear, but the thing that was created, much as they were, in the name of science that wants to destroy them. And it is up to a brave few to take on the monumental task of preserving the last of humanity.
I would recommend this film to anyone with the caveat that some scenes may be too scary for small, immature children.",1374192000,,1353,4.227799227799228

3974058,5,B002RD55NK,"My absolute favorite movie! The tale is after the apocalypse where humans were all taken down by machines, small creatures known as Stitchpunks are all that remain, fighting the machines to survive.

While there's not a lot of characters, the characters that are in the movie are all distinct and realistic with their own positives and flaws. One is the overbearing leader, Two is the kindly Inventor, Three and Four are the mute twins, Five is the shy Healer, Six is the premonition-seeing Artist, Seven is the only female and Warrior, Eight is the right-hand guard to One, and Nine, the main protagonist, is the somewhat confused and somewhat naive newborn who must venture into this new world in an attempt to stop the Fabrication Machine/ B.R.A.I.N. who controls the rest of the machines.

Absolutely amazing! Maybe not everyone's thing, naturally, but there's no movie that is EVERYONE'S thing. The DVD came in only a few days and was in brand new condition as promised.

I'm glad the movie had enough character to show that not all that is good will make it to the end.... I respect any movie that allows threats to be real and capable lest they be seen as incompetent and little more than a plot device.

3974100,4,B002RD55NK,"9 is one of those movies which are so beautiful and artistically rendered that you can see how much love and effort the creators and animators have put into making a post-apocalyptic world both gritty and haunting

but it's too damn short to develop its own story!

[Spoiler Alert]

At its core, 9 is a tale of nine ragdolls, imbued with a piece of a soul of their creator, threatened by the awakening of a great war machine that has wiped out humankind. It is a tale that has so much potential to be story that could have been a deeply human story about non-human characters trying to survive. As one who had watched Japanese OVAS (original animated videos) that are as short as 9 but have a fully-realized plot not withheld by pacing issues, I was very disappointed after watching 9 not once but several times. 9 suffers from a (sadly) common flaw of rushing by so fast that you hardly feel for the characters and, just as you are about to know more about them, they die.

That's it, characters die as soon as they are introduced.

While it's understandable that 9 has been based off of the original short film of the same name and that trying to further expand on something that is only 10 minutes long is a feat in of itself, it still suffers from a brisk pacing issue, a story that finishes too quickly, and characters who might as well be characterized by their quirks.

Still, for all the quips I have about it, 9 is admittedly a beautiful film with a surprisingly deep background involving a world war and the philosophical aspects of alchemy and the soul [this information was taken from the deleted scenes in the DVD as well as the official site and promotional material]. If this was explored more in the film, it certainly would have been a very different but genuinely more moving.

Overall, 9 certainly is different in its setting and aesthetics, but the story falls short of falling outside of the norm.",1343088000,,1918,4.526011560693641

3974108,4,B002RD55NK,"You have to give director Shane Acker and producer Tim Burton some credit for the ingenuity of creating an animated apocalyptic tale using rag dolls as their main characters. 9 is a film so different and unique that it is difficult to categorize: it is computer animation, sci-fi, action adventure, and morality tale all rolled into one. With Burton producing, you know you will have darker elements as well.

One excellent aspect of 9 is simply its depth and originality. It's not a simple animated by any means, as it explores humanity vs. technology in some ways, but also the abuse of power from a high-standing human (The Chancellor). Also, each rag doll has a unique trait and strength that they use to help each other with their cause against the various machines, so they have human aspects. Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, and Crispin Glover are some of the cast who lead the voices of the dolls.

Tim Burton fans should give this one a try. It is a darker film, though, and does contain some violence, so it might not be best suited for younger children.

9 is a creative, ingenious concept, visually impressive, and a breath of fresh air from many of the other animated films.",1337385600,,1203,4.691943127962086

It was a fresh take on the ""apocalyptic film"" genre that is now dominated by natural disasters in today's films.

But I am a fan of Tim Burton and animation so when I came across it of course I had to check it out. And I was therefore surprised at the somewhat violent content. Death in animation is something you don't really expect.

I really enjoyed this movie, though. I had to watch it twice before I understood it, and I expect I'll get even more out of it with future viewings. Movies that make me think have always been my favorite type of movie, and that was another thing I was not expecting when I popped an animated movie into my DVD player. Not that there aren't other animated features out there aimed at adults, but this is about the most complicated one I've seen.

I really appreciated the animation as well. I especially liked how, while all the rag dolls had a similar appearance, they all had features that made them totally unique. There was not a lot of color, as it was a post-apocalyptic world, but there was still a lot to look at. All in all, a pretty interesting movie.",1333152000,2,1103,4.298076923076923

3974131,5,B002RD55NK,"Animated movies, especially computer animated ones usually are a good batch though some have fell by the way side lately and have been the same thing over and over, in animation and plot. What makes ""9"" different than the rest is the look and feel of the movie as a whole while the plot is basic the animation is different, cool looking and looks very different from the recent crop of animated movies.

""9"" is set in a post apocalyptic world seemingly some time around the World War II timeline where machines created by man have reduced the world to a waste land. After a neat opening sequence we are slowly introduced to 9 characters that are basically rag dolls, with plenty of personality, each different.

These 9 are the only survivors after the war, that is until 9 (Elijah Wood, ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy) awakens the big brain of the machines while trying to save 2 (Martin Landeau, ""Ed Wood""). The rest of the film is the 9 trying to evade and fight the machines and find a way to stop them.

The problem is it's hard to describe the plot without making it sound stupid and simple, while it is simple it's far from stupid. The voice actors fit each character, 5 (John C. Reilly, ""Chicago"", ""Step Brothers""), 1 (Christoper Plummer, ""The Insider"", ""National Treasure"") 6 (Crispin Glover, ""Back to the Future"", ""The Frighteners"") and 7 (Jennifer Connelly, ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still""). There's also 3 and 4, but they are mute so obviously no voice actors are listed.

The animation is top notch, the look is unique and fresh in just about every aspect. It's well worth seeing, even the music score fits the action. See it and be impressed. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",1317859200,2,1700,4.582236842105263
3974132,4,B002RD55NK,"Interesting movie i thought. set in post-apocalyptic planet Earth these dolls are hiding from the beast. this movie was pretty good and a little short. I like a longer movie but this one was good. I don't think I would want to own it or anything even though I almost bought it from Target the other day on sale I'm glad I watched what I recorded on TV first. I doubt I'll ever watch it again because I remember almost every minute of this one since it was so short. it's only about an hour and a half long so if you don't like looooooong drawn out movies then this is for you! the characters were very well designed and voice talents were awesome. some of the ""bad guy"" characters are a little freaky for children hence the PG-13 rating, especially the beast, it's a skull with red eyes and a medal stick body. the last evil character looked like something out of Anime. Long worm-like thing that sucks up the cloth dudes with a cracked baby doll face and red eyes. not for children. maybe 12 or 13 but no younger I'd recommend. Other than that this movie is more interesting than good. four stars for the Cd, voices, effects, and what little plot there is.",1315353600,,1157,4.336405529953917
3974133,4,B002RD55NK,"This is one of those films that is done with computer graphics that try to make it look like it's stop motion. Okay, whatever. The film opens with a mystery - who is this strange doll-like creature that has woken up without a voice and the number 9 written on his back? He probably doesn't even know himself. So, off we go on a voyage of learning. Soon he is terrorized by lethal machines that snap, stab and attack, then he finds others of his kind. The enemy is alive, but it is sleeping. Then he wakes it up... and real problems start. The movie is not about finding answers, but about righting wrongs and bringing life back - not to its earlier form, but the less-bad situation of the start of the film. How frustrating. The plot, unfortunately, doesn't really make any sense. But, in a way, you don't care, because you feel for the creatures you see, and the effects are beautiful. The creatures are effectively sewn out of sack cloth, and the animation captures it lovingly, as it does the strange lighting and the great action scenes. A very nice film, in spite of everything. I saw this film on the same weekend I saw Royston Tan's ""881' - what's with these number movies?",1314230400,2,1180,4.442396313364055

3974135,5,B002RD55NK,"I caught this animated movie for the first time on HBO some nights ago. I have purchased this fine DVD as a result. Director Shane Acker and producers Tim Burton & Timur Bekmambetov took a well-known storyline (Armageddon/""end of world"") and wove it into a whole new perspective which I think was incredible! For one thing, the movie is set in alternate Earth whose technological advancements appear to have flourished way before the advent of the 20th Century, finally & destructively culminating into somewhere between the end of the First World War (notice the destroyed World War-I type tank, barbed wire, sandbags and an artillery piece typical of a post-World War One breech-loader design) and possibly around the early 1940s (the helmet our friends were seeking protection in appeared to be an old 1940s WW-II style U.S. M-1 Hatfield pot helmet). Also, this time frame convinced me more so when 9 and his friends celebrated the destruction of the factory by playing a not-very-old vinyl record with Judy Garland's ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", popularized in the classic film ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" which was released in 1939! When all-out (world?) war broke out, with armies utilizing machines akin to ""War of the Worlds"" designs,but armed with rapid-firing machine guns (not lasers) and subsequently, the machines turn against Mankind itself, I desperately tried to figure out what role our characters had in all of this.  The beauty of the film is how the characters try to determine how they came to be, which grasped my curiosity even further--and, at the end, we finally discover the WHY of it all. I refuse to reveal the ending, but this animated masterpiece is DEFINITELY A MUST-SEE!! A very powerful and sentimental film albeit set in depressive surroundings. Director/producers performed admirably in the making of this movie; Heaven knows, Hollywood needs more talent like THIS!! A beautiful film indeed and sure to become a CLASSIC!",1312243200,,1957,5.0965732087227416

3974147,4,B002RD55NK,"A small robot is completed by an old man, but wakes up ages later in a ruined world.  The robot, '9', stumbles on a colony of other robots like himself, but numbered '1' through '8'.  The tale of the ruin of the world, and the maker's intent for the nine manninkins unfolds in Burton's distinctive visual style, and complimented by Danny Elfman's music.

The underlying themes of elements of the human soul, the consequences of totalitarian government, and the impact of organized religion aren't very subtle, but don't distract from 9's quest to undo damage he caused, and to understand his role in the world.

Visually, it is typical of Burton, which is to say far beyond anyother movie maker today.  The characters have character; they are distinctive and engaging.  The settings are powerful and serve the story well.  The iconics are well thought out and should age well, at least for the next several decades.  Elfman's music supports the mood of this film well.

It is important to remember that this is an animation, but not a children's movie.  There is a considerable amount of violence, a novel depiction of drug use, and the imagery of a ruined and desolated world might upset many youngsters.

Definately not for everyone, but a 'must see' for Burton fans.

3974148,3,B002RD55NK,"This movie suffers from what tvtropes calls ""fridge logic"", in that the movie seems to make perfect sense until you get up and walk to the fridge, and while separated from the narrative and free to pick it apart while doing the mudane task of visiting the fridge, you notice how many tiny holes are in it.  Leaps of logic and character development that aren't properly earned through the story telling.

It is a beautiful movie, and I feel that the texture and style of the world give it a strong tangible presence (which helps to overcome the logic problems in the story, you don't think about the problems, because you feel part of the world being presented).  The enemy monsters are scary, especially the snake.  So good for them on that front.

It is DEFINITELY not a movie for small kids and the rating is definitely age appropriate. That said, I do feel that this film is geared more to adults who would have a better understanding about it's metaphysical concepts. I find that this film explores more than the cliched fear of machines and AI...it's a study in hope. The character renderings are beautifully done and the voice talent is perfect across the board.

3974153,4,B002RD55NK,"I'll be honest. I saw this in the theater first and walked out of the theater feeling a bit...blah. The visual effects were excellent and the voice acting was great but the story felt lacking. I hadn't recommended it to any friends. I would have given it maybe 3 stars.
Then, I picked it up on DVD. I found a slimmed down version of the DVD with limited extras for approx $10 in a local PC store. This made all the difference in the enjoyment of watching the movie at my own pace and having the commentary and being able to watch the original film short was so much better.
Review of the film short:
I personally felt that the film short which the creator made for his college thesis was better than the actual movie. There are no voice actors in the short. It was explained that the writing, directing, production (everything) had to be done by the one college student from start to finish. This is a testiment to his ability to make a film from scratch by himself. Lots of film students do this but not on this level. It really is a MUST SEE. They explain that because its a film short and you only see the main character 9 learning to survive an encounter with one of the hunter machines, there was no back story showing how he was made, where the hunters come from, etc. That is why the full length ""9"" was made. I know I said the full length movie felt lacking but I felt the film short was just more entertaining even though there was less back story.
I highly suggest people watch the film short and then watch the full length 9.
In the behind the scenes they don't have to explain any of the hidden messages or morales to the story. They describe the making of it and why there is more back story shown.
I'm tempted to pick it up on Bluray for more special features and better visuals.
People have said this is an ADULT film. Well, although it is more mature than the average animation, I felt this is the kind of movie that can be used to explain some of the more difficult lessons in life to the younger generation (if needed).",1291593600,,2037,4.2661498708010335

3974155,3,B002RD55NK,"The animation is stunning, the plot is more than a little lacking.

'9' is a very short film running about 75 minutes, and it's CGI world is a thing to behold, unlike anything I've seen since the Final Fantasy movies.  Rich in detail, crisp in execution, its appearance is really the main draw of the entire movie, and I think that unfortunately, the directors decided to focus a little too much on what they could do with the graphics and animation, and not enough on telling a cohesive story.

Basically the story is about some little burlap-sack people who are trying to survive in a desolate wasteland.  Trying is the key word, since they are under CONSTANT attack from the various smaller machines that are built by the primary antagonist, a machine that caused the destruction of all of mankind.

It's a good premise, and full of good ideas, but it's not told in a good way.  First, we see 9 waking up, then 9 meets 2, then 9 and 2 get attacked by a robot cat.  9 then meets more sack people, who are then attacked again.  They go on a little adventure, meet another sack person, and are attacked.  They then meet everyone else, and are then attacked again.  We learn a little about the world, and then there's another battle.  A little more backstory, a lot more battle.  Story, battle, story, battle.  The unfortunate thing is that the little plot we get is actually pretty engaging for most of the film, and could have carried the movie if developed a little further, but because of the constant stream of CGI awesomeness (and it is indeed a feast for the eyes), the story is left on the backburner...and then the plot holes start to emerge.

You'll end the movie with a lot more questions than answers, particularly about the future of earth, the motivation of the characters, and so forth.  A lot of questions with so few answers make the ending scene, and the fact that the film is so short, might leave many viewers lacking.  Watching it a second time will show that there were a few glaring plot holes that are easy to overlook the first time, and nearly story-killing the second time.

That said, if you take it as it is, you'll be entertained and astonished by how good computer animation movies have become when time and effort is put into them.  With solid action sequences (even if there are far too many), plus a good adventure story, I'd say '9' gets my vote as recommended, but you probably want to rent it.  I can't imagine too many people needing to see it twice.

NOTE: You, as a parent, know your kids best, but this movie is a lot like Coraline, which I think was a fantastic movie that shouldn't really be shown to just any child without previewing it first.  '9' is far less frightening, but there are some death scenes which I think might be a little intense for those under the age of 8 or 9.",1290470400,,2823,4.453307392996109
3974156,5,B002RD55NK,I love Tim Burton movies and 9 is one of my favorites.  The story is intriguing and the setting and characters are well-portrayed.  It is dark and twisted and psychologiacally thilling: all the hallmarks of a Tim Burton masterpiece!  I loved it!,1289260800,,245,4.785714285714286
3974157,3,B002RD55NK,"I particularly wanted to watch 9 in theatres, as the big-screen sounds and animation for such a movie is something that a home theatre cannot hope to compare to. The movie is directed by Shane Acker, produced by Tim Burton, and features the voices of Elijah Wood (9), John C. Reilly (5), and Jennifer Connelly (7).

The film begins with 9, a stitchpunk doll, waking up to a desolate world, ruined from war and devoid of life. A scattering of machines walk the harsh landscape, all the time looking for any signs of life (presumably that's what they're doing). 9 spies a group of other stitchpunks walking on the horizon, and he makes his way out of the destroyed building, grabbing a mysterious looking object before he leaves.

This starts a journey that is epic in scale, as the fate of all life is put on the battlefield. There are 9 total stitchpunks, and each one is unique and special. Together they must overcome difficulties and restore life to the ravaged world.

To me, watching 9 was like watching a movie version of a video game. The characters can rummage through the piles of junk and customize their weapons or apparel, there's a archetypal antagonist, and the quest to save life fits in there perfectly.

I had two major problems with 9. First, I felt that the characters were all mostly flat and stereotyped. The hero is 9, a young idealist. The other stitchpunks fall neatly in line. There's an untrusting one. There's a mean brute. There's a few kind and trusting ones. There's a wizened pair that have the answers to questions. There's a love interest for 9. There's a crazy one, who somehow has the answer to the mysterious object 9 took from the beginning. And the machines are all just wanting to wipe out all traces of life. The characterization for this film fell short, and I didn't feel any connection to any of them.

The second problem I had was that the movie didn't seem to have much of a plot, or a backstory, either. Sure, the characters did things, but the things they did were mostly dull and not too exciting. And when they did important things, they were predictable and expected. Even the ending was predictable. And the backstory, which had potential, was typical and lacking sufficient explanation.

Despite the flat characters and the less-than-stellar plot, the movie wasn't all in shambles. The film was an absolute joy to watch. The CGI is amazing. The unique post-apocalyptic art style the designers were shooting for worked superbly, and I enjoyed seeing the art in action. The stitchpunks each have their own individual design, and every one of them were cool to look at. Some of the inventions they come up with are also pretty impressive.

Overall, I paid $6 for a matinee ticket to an okay movie. Was it worth it? Yes. Did I learn anything or feel anything special from watching it? No. Nothing new, anyway. Terminator, The Matrix, and WALL-E have already taught us not to put too much stock in machines, and that they'll eventually turn against us. Would I recommend this to you? Yes, and no. If you want to see some pretty cool artistic ideas in a bleak world and you don't care to spend money on that, go for it. If you're looking for an epiphany, you may have to try something else.",1288828800,,3236,4.627177700348432

3974159,5,B002RD55NK,"I hesitated to see this movie because it got mixed reviews, and most of the negative ones said the story was weak (which is a big deal for me).  Now that I've seen it, I'm sorry I waited so long.

This movie is visually breathtaking, and that alone is worth the price of a rental.  The steampunk character design is actively fascinating, in that you'll want to pause the movie from time to time to see how things fit together.  The characters' personalities are well-defined and interesting (I'd say on par with a Pixar movie, which is to say better than most live-action movies), and as for the story, it's actually quite engaging and even subtly intelligent.

People who complain about the story being weak and feeling incomplete are ACTUALLY complaining that it's depressing.  They'll probably flame me for saying that, but it's true.  This is not a movie for young children or even most adults, as it does not pull punches when it comes to death.  I don't want to include any spoilers, so let's just say this movie would be way more at home with a European audience than an American one.  That's not a slight against the US -- it's just that we go to the movies generally expecting that they'll end up with the good guys being rewarded and the bad guys being punished (or at least converted to good guys), and that doesn't really happen here.  The ending you do get with this movie is just short of brilliant if you're paying close attention.

Some people have griped about the story being cliche because it involves technology turning against humans, but that's like claiming the story of The Matrix is cliche.  It's all about the execution, and it's executed here in a way you have not seen before.  (Side note -- did anybody else pick up a reference to the Philip K. Dick story ""Second Variety""?)  It won't be everyone's favorite movie, but if you're willing to pay attention and put aside some of your expectations, it just may be yours.",1287532800,3,1945,4.583815028901734

Produced by Tim Burton(..and a few others), the film certainly has the look of something Burton would have his hands in. This film is NOT FOR CHILDREN and is really quite dark and scary at times. The story is very straightforward and the animation is really excellent even if the color palette is muted and dark, the design of the creatures is top notch with a haunting quality(one of Burton's signature attributes).

9 is probably one of the best animated films in many years and while it was overshadowed by the likes of WALL E and UP, it isn't any less impressive. Put the kids to bed and give this one a shot, its really a great film.",1287446400,7,820,4.430463576158941

I am so disappointed in the story.  Compared to the exquisite, lush, dystopian vision of the art of the film, the plot is so hackneyed and boring that it made me want to weep.  If half the innovation and artistic sense of the visual (and even musical) side of the film was put into the storyline and the character development this would have been the film of the century.

This is what Blu Ray is all about,i had to turn down my surround sound due the sound quality being so crisp and clear and consistent throughout the whole movie. The blu ray really shows the detail on the characters and scenery beautifully. This is one of the better Blu Rays I've seen.

Now onto the material in the movie. Some say its not a movie for kids due to the scene in the beginning. I don't see a huge issue with it, most kids will understand the premise of the movie if you explain it. The characters were all fantastic and each one brought importance to the storyline which contained such a deep message(which has been conveyed in many reviews and does show on the special features). Ultimately the inventor creates the rag dolls, and with each doll he uses a piece of his soul to bring them to life. Ultimately to make up for creating the machines, that are souless beings(it goes much further into it, but I don't want to give away spoilers etc.) This film was very fast paced and not a moment was wasted, I was watching and didn't even check the time once. I do that often when watching movies as usually about halfway through i loose interest. I realize that being an animated movie, generally speaking the time is alot shorter than most films. But the length was perfect,very rarely can I appreciate everything in a 2-3 hour film. They worked so well with the 80 minutes they used, you see character developement, back story(cause and effect), as well as diving deeper into the origins of the rag dolls. I saw bits and pieces of other movies in this picture such as Terminator(the obvious reference to human builds machine, machine gets smart and kills human), as well as the design of the machines which very very closely resembles that of War of the Worlds(2005). That did not bother me, as those are two of my favorite movies anyway. In fact, I actually appreciated it. However, as i stated above there is a much deeper meaning to this film so keep your eyes and ears open :)

I had read some so-so reviews on here and I did take them into consideration before watching, but for me, my expectations were surpassed. Everyone has a different taste in film, but I highly recommend this. You could do alot worse for 80 minutes out of your life ;)

The machines won of course. But on that last machine the mad scientist who was not completely mad built a plug-in that had to be brought and that plug-in is working two ways. It activates the machine if it is plugged into the machine or it is the destroying element if it is activated when off the machine. Then he creates some nice little mechanical humanoids whose mission it is to destroy the mechanical folly that destroyed the world. The last of these little technical androids is number Nine and he will succeed in his mission. The details are in the film itself. It is nave, slightly frightening, definitely sickening about the silliness and gullibility of human beings. It is also full of hope that these little nice mechanical androids who are given the planet after this catastrophe will be better than human beings. Human beings had been created by God and these by a not so mad after all scientist. You can imagine the madness of God who created such an unmanageable species.

Still, in the end the finished product is going to be the make or break of the outcome when giving your gift to the public. Unfortunately when it comes to animation it is normally associated with family and child appeal. At this point in animations history unless your work relates to immaturity or pop culture humiliation it will be very seldom and an adult audience will find interest.

With all that said we are introduced to the film `9'. The backdrop is a post apocalyptic world where the human race was destroyed by man made machines. Now, we can immediately point a finger and say rip off, until we are introduced to the main characters which happen to be man made rag dolls. 9 is the newest one who awakes long after the battle is over. He has no idea where he is or why is he here. All he knows is that he holds something important and the friends he meets along the way help him piece together his past as well as his purpose and what he must do to rebuild the future.

Shane Acker, the director of `9' originally had these characters in an academy award nominated short film. To spread this story out into a 90 minute film was a challenge and in my opinion broke new ground at the same time is still incomplete. The first major positive without a doubt had to be the concept. For animation a drama is not something you usually see. The plot falls on the lines of Don Bluth story telling like `An American Tale' or `Titan AE'. Those films have the same first major flaw, which is the attempt to make an animated drama non child oriented. While `9' does have a PG-13 rating, it is because of the scary cyberpunk like machines that run amuck and of course the fact that characters die. However, that brings the second flaw which is the lack of dialogue. As much as Shane Acker wants his worlds to be based upon visuals, the movie going public needs dialogue due to its dying attention span. The dialogue was very well done because of its stellar voice cast. It really brought those rag dolls heart and made them believable. What I loved the most about this movie was the whole mystery of the discovering the reason why these characters were here. In the beginning you knew who was creating them, but you didn't know why he was. In the end when all is brought into fruition you reflect on everything you saw and are left in complete awe. That is what makes great story telling.

I found this movie very interesting and the fact that a mastermind like Tim Burton did gave me an urge to see it. It probably won't be a movie I would see again, but I would definitely be interest in future films of this nature.

I had no idea where the film plot was going and I have never seen a film like this; I challenge the idea that anyone watching this film 'knew' where the plot was going. The film is very well paced with no real down time.
In terms of the design of the film it is nothing less than brilliant and the angel is in the details. The dystopian visual archetypal conjurings of H.G. Wells, ""War of the Worlds"" and George Orwell's, ""1984"" are an achievement.
""9"" is CGI at its very best. This is no film for children and that's for sure - it would probably scare the pants off of them at a certain age simply for it's downbeat tone. I loved the fact that this film stayed within itself and didn't try and be some amazing blockbuster with cutesy plot threads.
""9"" is certainly not a film for everybody but the talent that went into making it is undeniable. What an eccentric and weird film.
As far as the voices go, only Plummer's was so distinctly effective that it merited a known voice. I take issue with the effectiveness of using famous actors in animated films.

The only ""living"" entities on the planet are nine rag doll things, created by a dying scientist in an attempt to ensure that life will continue. Each doll has a hand-written number on its back, in the order they were created. To the last one, 9, he has left instructions and a special device that, he hopes, can restore life to the planet. But he dies before he can give 9 the instructions on what he's supposed to do next...

And so 9 comes to life in a dead world, his first sight the dead scientist's body lying on the floor in front of him. Soon, he meets up with the other eight rag doll things that were brought to live by the scientist as well. Who are being chased and captured by some bizarre robot that has the skull of a dog for a head. And there's this little green disk thing that glows with these odd symbols and -

You know, I'll just stop right there with the plot summary, because it doesn't matter. 9 is quite enjoyable when taken at the level of ""Wow! Does this look cool!!"" But taken on the level of narrative or characters or plot - no way, man. Just forget it. 9 is probably the best-looking film I've seen in a long time that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I'm actually serious when I say it's fun to watch - I certainly watched the whole movie, and didn't feel bored or cheated at all. But it really is just sort of a moving art piece.

The set design and artwork on 9 is stunning. The look of the devastated alternative steampunk future world is beautifully desolate. The odd creations concocted by the Brain Machine to go chase and... uh... kill, I guess... the rag dolls are a joy to watch. But when the movie was over, I thought ""Huh. That would've made a really great short film"".

And lo and behold, a look at the extras on the disk reveal that, in fact, 9 was a short animated film originally, and was later expanded into a full-length feature. The original short film is included here as well. I watched the short. It had everything that was cool in the feature, without the meaningless plot and expensive voiceover actors. I can see immediately how it must've impressed the hell out of anyone who saw it.

But. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone wanted to turn such an excellent little short work into a puzzling feature length film. I started putting together possible scenarios in my head: Did the studio want the talents of creator Shane Acker, but the only way to get him was to agree to make a feature-length version of his short? Did he have an even stranger idea that they turned down in lieu of this one? Did they look at District 9 and say ""Hey! We should take some other science fiction short film and turn it into a feature too!"" Did they approve the entire concept while stoned? Inquiring minds want to know!

In the final analysis, I'd say that 9 is a odd but artistic experimental film that will probably appeal to die-hard science fiction fans and/or animation buffs only.",1272326400,,3118,4.404513888888889

But in the course of his journey, he will face unimaginable dangers, meet more of his own kind and discover the awful truth about the destruction of the world of which he has become a reluctant part...

Shane Acker's ""Nine"" marries the sensibilities of Steampunk and ""Pinocchio"" with those of ""The Terminator"" and sets them against a back-drop which resembles the ruined ""Everytown"" from William Cameron Menzies'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-G-Wells-Things-to-Come/dp/B000056NWH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H.G. Wells - Things to Come</a>;it may just be the most darkly evocative piece of CGI animation that has ever or will ever be brought to the big-screen by a Hollywood studio.

Despite featuring a wealth of American acting talent (including Elijah Wood, Jennifer Conolly, Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer) and a largely conventional ""quest"" plot, It's tone is closer to that of the darker work of Terry Gilliam and European animators and cartoonists such as Rene Laloux and Jean ""Moebius"" Girard. An early scene in which ""Nine"" happens across the corpse of a dead mother and child in a ruined car locates it far outside of the warm and fluffy sensibilities of a ""Toy Story"" or a ""Madagascar""; as do the deeply scary adversaries that ""Nine"" faces in the course of his quest (one in particular - which resembles a cross between a Gorgon, a Cobra and a deeply sinister doll - could no doubt give more impressionable children nightmares for weeks)

For my own part - and despite it's relative brevity (the film only lasts roughly an hour and nine minutes) - I was transfixed by Acker's vision. He has expanded the scope and breadth of his original Oscar nominated animated short (which is available as an extra on the DVD) and created a luridly beautiful and spookily evocative portrait of a world destroyed through a combination of unscrupulous government and runaway technology. There is a wealth of sumptuous detail to be enjoyed here (in my first viewing alone, I noticed visual references to the ""Manhattan Project"", World War One photography, H.G. Wells, Greek mythology and even one rather cheekily explicit reference to Geoff Taylor's painting, ""Panic In The Streets"" - which progressive rock fans will remember from the inlay booklet of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Wayne-s-Musical-Version-Of-The-War-Of-The-Worlds/dp/B0009MAPUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds</a>&nbsp;album)  and visually at least, I suspect that this is a film which demands repeated viewings to fully appreciate all that is going on in it.

""Nine"" is not quite the masterpiece that it could have been - both my partner and I felt that the denouement of the film felt hurried and didn't reach the logical conclusion towards which the plot was obviously heading - but it is a deeply fascinating piece of dark fantasy which takes genuine risks within an animated medium which for far too long has been the preserve of the infantile.

I was initially intrigued by the ten minute short film version.  So that was my expectation going in.  However, the film kinda left me feeling inconclusive, even disappointed at the end.

There's no real believable setup at the beginning.  There's no real tie-in between the initial catasrophe and the presences of the rag dolls.  Even though it's explained later, it's by then too late to change the first impression: Why do I really care about these stupid rag dolls?  They represent nothing I relate to.

Ultimately, mankind gets to survive in the form of three rag dolls who have inherited a world they have no absolutely no relation to whatsoever?  The progeny of a people they have no knowledge of at all?  Mankind is as lost at the end as at the beginning?  They won nothing they didn't already have, except maybe the power to have their misery unimpeeded and uniterrupted by persecution?

There's three of them left, with apparently no way to procreate and repopulate, and no real memory of the world before, and no real memory even of who they are.  So what's the point?  They saved the world so the three of them could live in the new world alone for ever?

You are left wondering what exactly did this ""scientist"" hope to achieve with his little inventions?  THIS?

Oh, and like other's have said - definately not for children.  It's more like raggedy-ann meets ""Hardware (1990)""",1266019200,,1409,4.75206611570248
3974194,3,B002RD55NK,"At a glance, it's hard to figure out what 9 is all about.  There are ragdolls fighting in a post-apocalyptic landscape, but beyond that the trailers don't convey much.  It probably didn't help that 9 was released amidst a swirl of movies with ""nine"" in the title.

9 takes place in a steampunk cross between Terminator and Little Big Planet, where the soulless Fabrication Machine known as BRAIN has destroyed all of humanity in an alternate history version of World War II. 9 is a Tim Burton tale of good and evil, as evidenced by the soft cloth of the ""stitchpunk""-style green-eyed homunculi and the soulless red eye of BRAIN (Binary Reactive Artificially-Intelligent Neurocircuit). Similar to the premise of the sci-fi flop Virus, BRAIN sees everything as raw material, including organic remains. It fashions a series of increasingly lethal scouts, all with the sole purpose of absorbing and retrieving the souls of the heroic homunculi.

These poor little dolls are in for a world of hurt.  Not much larger than a human hand, they embody all the traditional survivalist tropes of the post-apocalyptic genre: the power hungry leader (1), the befuddled but kind scientist (2), the innocents (3 and 4), the apprentice (5), the crazy prophet (6), the tough chick (7), the muscle (8), and of course or titular hero (9) who bucks the system. In this little slice of hell, the homunculi battle for both dominance and survival.

But really this is about fights between little stitch dolls and cyborgs. And what fights they are! There's the Cat Beast, the Winged Beast, and the Seamstress, and of course the BRAIN itself. The battles are as much symbolic as they are exciting, contrasting human vs. machine, soul vs. soulless, emotion vs. logic.

There are problems however. The biggest issue being that 9 is as much responsible for the plight of the homunculi as he is the solution.  There are twists along the way, but the emotional heft lent to the struggle of these human-analogues is weakly supported by its simplistic setting. Because the ending is largely open to interpretation, a viewer's level of satisfaction depends on his perspective on evolution, faith, and the meaning of floating green dots in a drop of water.  9 is more metaphor than movie and certainly not for children, but it's a story worth watching.",1266019200,2,2317,4.920512820512821
3974195,5,B002RD55NK,"This story is a good character drama/adventure that enlists some well established stars and some rising stars as acting talent.  The consistency of animation design in maintaining scale reference and establishing mood tones offers a wonderful palette to the viewer.  It is easy to settle in and accept the story as it unfolds as if it were live action.

Something of a Darwinian fantasy, but it does not megaphone the rhetoric like is often a temptation in sci-fi/fantasy.  It leaves such elements in the distant background and focuses on character development and character conflict.  The result is a very human drama in non-human skin.  It succeeds on a level that I think ""Wall e"" attempted but didn't quite capture.  ""Wall e"" is still a fair production that made it's mark with a somewhat different tone and texture.  ""9"" is darker but is not what I would call typically ""Burtonesque.""  It is a collaboration that has foundation on an acclaimed animation short (included on the DVD) which was apparently designed to launch a larger story.

The story comes full circle with some resolution and a glimmer of optimism.  This story doesn't even pretend to answer all the questions it creates, and I think it works better without trying to.  I think that the best stories don't give too much away, and the same is true of critical reviews.

**********

After posting this review I read some of the others and have more to say.

I believe that some people are confusing plot development and/or character development with an exhibitionist style of presentation that leaves little or nothing to the imagination (i.e. Harry Potter.)  You may not find the development dynamic enough for your tastes but it is there.  This story is vague enough to allow imagination and theological/philosophical perspective to fill in the gaps.  This movie is NOT AN ATTACK ON ANY BELIEF because it serves more as an open metaphor that the viewer can interpret many different ways. Tone and character are what it stands or falls on.

It amazes me whenever people complain of lack of development in an action tale.  Even in real life, high stress environments AT BEST put a damper on social or intellectual exposition and AT WORST destroy the life and the motive together before it even has the chance to present itself.  A real action drama isn't a soapbox or tea party or debate.  It moves too fast to ""get to know"" much else than confusion.  Be thankful for whatever ""development"" an action drama gives you.  It's unrealistic (often cheesy) to expect deep or well defined moments in such environments.  Survival trumps all.

3974200,3,B002RD55NK,"That almost won an Academy Award.

Just like I almost liked this movie.

Almost.

""9"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the only creatures alive are several rag-doll robots and a cat-like robot intent on murdering all of them. When the final doll comes to life- 9 - he is born in a swirl of confusion, grief, and mystery. He soon finds the other ragdolls, and, asking questions and braving the odds, he transforms their world as the struggle to save the last of the human race begins.

I started this movie with apprehension, because I'm not fond of dark Tim movies, and I don't really love movies that have a dead Earth between its thumbs. But I decided to try it anyways, and when I finished it, I had several thoughts, with more than one opinion.

First of all, this is not a ""bad"" movie, no failure in my eyes. It has potential and a deep storyline, with excellent acting and beautiful CGI. But it doesn't feel like great material, like a movie I'd enjoy enough to buy and re-watch. See, the plot is rather confusing, and feels bumbling, with rises and falls that blend blindly, so that it feels as shabby and rough sometimes as the burlap cloth the dolls are made of. With rather unbelievable plot twists (the female doll, 7, who killed the cat-robot ends up being a damsel in distress at the end) and too many monster machines (by the third time they'd killed a robot, I was like, can little ragdoll people honestly kill 'em off that easily?), I didn't completely enjoy it.

However, I think it's really worth a watch. It tries to deliver a message about evolution and freedom and peace, and all those qualities are what kept my eyes on the screen for however long it was. Kids really shouldn't watch it, but here's the weird thing about ""9"": it's PG-13, so obviously it's meant for teens and adults, yet it feels a bit like a kid's movie, with no themes that an adult can truly enjoy. So it's really in-between categories, with none to really claim for itself, and that is what really frusterated me about this movie. It could have been an amazing movie, and if the director and all them had just worked a bit harder, I believe it could have been more of a classic Tim-related movie.

But it wasn't. And that's why it will never exactly deserve five stars.",1265328000,,2275,4.480676328502415

3974203,4,B002RD55NK,"Possible Spoilage ahead:

This was a very odd film, as is Tim Burton's nature.  Basically man has destroyed the world leaving a sole survivor to attempt to save life on planet earth.  Ironically the sole survivor is the scientist who engineered the destruction of mankind via the creation of a machine with superior artificial intelligence.  Clearly the scientist has read the Harry Potter series of books and chooses to sustain life by splitting his soul into nine (9) pieces and embedding them into Horcruxes.  It's also clear that the scientist really had an affinity for Dolby the House Elf as he puts all nine soul fragments into socks of different sizes.

The story focuses on one sock, aptly named ""9"" and his search for meaning and existence.  He quickly runs into a few pairs of other socks and finds a small society led by ""1"", a cautious sock who wants to prevent his return to the proverbial sock drawer at all costs.  A power struggle ensues where the subsistence based society butts heads with the pursuit of freedom.

""9"" leads a rag tag bunch of socks in search of their creator and accidentally awaken the Skynet-like mechanical overlord that destroyed humanity.  They also run into a spider-like mechanical monstrosity from the Matrix with eerie soul stealing powers.  I gotta say that when the first sock is de-souled I nearly wet myself.  This is not a movie for kids - unless you want to get them to clean their room... ""Timmy, pick up your socks or the soul-sucking mechanical spider monster is going to come in and get them!""

The movie approaches several high level concepts, such as: what is life, understanding foreign intelligence, and where is technology leading us.  Unfortunately all it does is approach these concepts.  I'm not sure how it could tackle them completely given the fact that the protagonist is a sock.

Ultimately it's a movie worth seeing.",1264723200,3,1885,4.825545171339564
3974204,4,B002RD55NK,"In a post apocalyptic wasteland where a war between man and machines has killed every living thing, a scientist creates nine living beings each called by their number. Led by 1 (Christopher Plummer) they hide in the ""Sanctuary."" But when 9 (Elijah Wood) sets off a doomsday type machine while trying to rescue 2 (Martin Landau) they must either hide or fight for their lives.

It seems that 2009 was the year of the return of the post apocalyptic movie. Of course, with the massive success of 2007's I Am Legend it was only a matter of time before the rest of Hollywood followed suit. And it did, releasing Terminator: Salvation, The Road, 2012, and The Book of Eli. The genre even found it's way into computer animated features with Shane Acker's 9. The road to 9 started off with a highly acclaimed, and Oscar nominated, short film that caught the eye of visionary directors Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch, Wanted) and Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd) who saw the potential in Acker's short to become a feature film and signed up to produce the film. So how does the former short fare as a feature length film?

Fairly well, even if at a slim 79 minutes it still feels short on running time. Acker has a real eye for the unique, and his visual creations are breathtaking and at some points even frightening. The computer animation is so meticulous in it's attention to detail that at times you have to wonder if you're watching stop motion animation, especially considering that in the scheme of the world of the movie the robots and the nine are made largely from common household items and (gasp!) bones and other assorted average materials. Ackers also wastes no time diving right into the action of this movie making it a real edge of your seat thrill ride from start to finish.

But that's part of the problem, with the short running time of the film and the fact that you're almost dropped right into the middle of an action scene you really feel like you've missed something. Really, 9 feels like half a movie, or almost like being with a couple friends talking amongst themselves about an even you weren't there for with people you don't know. Towards the end you're let in on what you feel you've missed out on, but the movie still doesn't completely feel like a coherent whole. On top of that the characters aren't completely fleshed out. Part of this is by design since the characters are simply parts of the whole, but even the character that should be a fully developed character doesn't feel fleshed out. Because of this the story relies more on the frailties and limitations of stature for it's main characters to cause the audience to feel for them rather than actually causing you to genuinely feel for the characters as individuals.

All in all, despite it's limitations in story telling, I would have to recommend this movie. The inventiveness and visual style alone are worth the price of admission (and possible the DVD price), and I look forward to seeing more of what Shane Acker will bring us in the future. That's to say nothing of the all star voice cast which includes Elijah Wood, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and John C. Reilly. Give it a try, you might enjoy it!

The human race has been wiped out, and a group of nine little puppet-like figures or rag dolls are all that's left, a spark of life except for some monsters. The movie concentrates on Number 9 who looks like his body is made of burlap with a zipper down his front. He meets the others. Number One, the leader, has a bishop-like hat (and the voice of Christopher Plummer), and his followers have taken refuge in a ruined church. There's a one-eyed puppet, Number 5, that befriends 9.
 It's a ruined industrial landscape with a lot of mechanical bits and pieces lying around. A forbidding desolate landscape that's creepy and scary is the background for the story. The industrial complex has gone mad. A scientist has left the nine little figures as some semblance of humanity on Earth to carry on in case the human race was wiped out.
 In one scene some of the nine rag dolls have been killed off, and their spirits rise to Heaven, leaving only a few to propagate a new race. There's some symbolic stuff, partially religious, that I think got lost in the journey from screen to viewer.

3974210,5,B002RD55NK,"There are so few times in life when a piece of entertainment can literally enrapture you but when one does come around, you wonder how you lived so long without seeing something like it. And this was my experience with 9, a single digit movie based on a single digit 11 minute short film of the same name, both directed by young genius Shane Acker.

The 11 minute film 9 was nominated for an Oscar in 2006 for Best Short, but didn't win. But it did get the notice of Tim Burton, who had fallen in love with Acker's idea and world. He wanted to see more of 9's bizarre existence and so, in true entrepreneurial fashion, they went out and did just that.

I have to admit here that I'd never heard nor seen the original 2005 short upon which this film was an extension (you can now view the 11 minute version on YouTube so that's not a problem anymore).  But after watching this, I IMMEDIATELY searched out the short film. Amazing. What's more amazing is that Acker took years and years to develop his work - and the technology - in order to give the burlap sack-like characters a sense of computer reality unrivaled before or since. And, if it is possible, even more amazing, I found it's visuals to be of a higher standard than the new AVATAR film everyone is raving about. Yes, they are THAT good. Every frame of this 79 minute film is brilliantly colored, muted and darkened. Looking at it, one gets a sense of near hypnosis, unable to pull their eyes away from what is, in every sense, wondrously appealing ...in a dark and dreary sort of way.

What else draws you in is the world that surrounds these nine characters. The simplicity (if you think about their names, 1 - 9) is perfectly formed from the beginning. The dangers aren't unique to human history, but to non-humans, this is a weird existence. The surrounding world is a mesh of alternate reality and, yet, familiarity. Songs such as ""Over The Rainbow"" play on ancient phongraphs while WWII weaponry bombard our heroes alongside advanced robots. Tell me that's something you've seen before?!

The voices actors were perfect choices, from Elijah Wood (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Rings</a>) as the title character 9, to Christopher Plummer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B001YV5068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>) as 1. Plummer's distinctive voice added a darker quality considering his past acting efforts ...which pulled the story up even further in my eyes (and ears).

What else should surprise viewers is that the film cost a measly $33 million to make and is only 79 minutes in length. Whereas things like Avatar cost significantly more and run three times as long.

If you really want to be transported to another world, and see what it might be like to view it from the eyes of strangers, don't look to Avatar, look toward 9. You won't be disappointed. I promise.",1264032000,,3010,5.020040080160321

The action sequences are on par with any Live-action film that bears the name which, for a cgi movie obstensibly pointed at kids,  is saying quite a lot.

However.

As with many films written or produced by Mr. Burton, where this project scores high on visual style it falls nearly flat on story. There really isn't much of one here, just enough really to keep you moving without ever actually engaging emotionally (another problem with Burton material more often than not).

You don't get to care about these characters. They look like puppets and they feel exactly like puppets going through the motions of a story whose outcome has no more meaning for them than the box in which they will be stored when the puppet show is done.

In other words, if you don't care about the mouse you don't care when the cat eats him.

The ending of this story is just weak, anticlimactic and, for me at least, totally unsatisfying.

I did buy the DVD because of the awesome visuals but I don't see this film finding a place in many hearts or minds who aren't keyed for this sort of thing. It may be cult fodder but, then again, maybe not.

The only living creatures left are nine small golems and at least one skeletal animal made of machine parts and a lot of sharpened metal intent on the killing or capturing the golems. As 9 meets up with the other golems the story progresses well, but unresolved questions hinder what started out with so much promise.

Focus Films says that the ""the very future of civilization may depend on"" the golems in the official synopsis. The question is: what civilization can there be with only a few ""living"" golems on an entire post-apocalyptic world? What can the golems do to save humanity or repopulate the world with life? What is the point of creating the golems? Why were the 8 golems hiding from the single skeletal creature and why didn't they simply team up and kill it?

3974226,3,B002RD55NK,"""9"" is an animated film based on the 2005 Academy Award nominated short film of the same name (which is included on the DVD).  The film is the work of animator Shane Acker and was co-produced by Tim Burton, who got involved with the project after seeing Acker's short film.  Although Burton did not write or direct ""9,"" the film is very consistent with his past animated work such as ""Corpse Bride.""  Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the movie focuses on a rag doll robot (!) named 9 who suddenly becomes sentient.  As he explores his world, he discovers that the only other inhabitants are other, similarly numbered rag doll robots as well as a strange cat-like machine who hunts them.  He befriends the other robots and changes their world drastically.

The world created in this film is fascinating and unlike any other animated film I've seen.  I particularly loved the use of contrasts, including having the robots made of burlap and other unexpected materials (Acker has referred to the bots as ""stitchpunks"").  The ""look"" of ""9"" is by far its main draw, though, because unfortunately the plot is a rather drab and predictable affair with the robots fighting the cat-like machine (and then other machines).  I found myself getting irritated by the repetitious battles and wanted to see more of this intriguing world.  Likewise, I wanted to see more of the adorable ""stitchpunks,"" especially the ""cataloguing"" scholars 3 and 4.  Unfortunately, as soon as the robots are introduced they almost immediately start chasing the machines.

As with other Tim Burton produced animated films, ""9"" is not targeted toward children (it's rated PG-13); however, the plot was too juvenile to keep me interested.  I actually strongly preferred the short film, which I watched after the feature-length movie.  Indeed, the short film packs a real emotional wallop that is sadly missing in the full-length version.  ""9"" is a noble failure (well semi-failure), and I applaud what Acker and Burton have tried to accomplish with this terrific looking film.  I just wish that the plot had been worthy of the animation.",1262995200,86,2101,4.977077363896848

It was strange watching it at first (how often do you see a dead body in an animated film in the first scene?), but once you get past the fact that this is an animated film for ADULTS, it's a very good movie.

~SPOILER ALERT~
For those of you who don't understand the movie, you weren't paying much attention. There were visual cues throughout as to where the machines come from (the BRAIN creates them) and also for where the characters 1-9 get their soul/s (they each get a *piece* of the scientist's soul). 9 gets the last piece of the scientist's soul, which is why the scientist died. Each character epitomizes various aspects of humanity: fear, survival, strength, courage, endurance, memory, self-sacrifice, etc.

The movie is rich with allusions and symbols that are drawn from human tendencies and survival instincts. I think it's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and find different meanings each time (if you're open to it). You could even go so far as to argue that the movie is religious in a way. The scientist gave his life to save humanity/life on earth. You could also say that the souls who are taken by the BRAIN are in a state similar to Limbo.

Also, one of the rag dolls is a female; what could be said about the fact that her soul came from a male scientist? Etc.

3974230,2,B002RD55NK,"Positives:
(1.) The animation was thoughtful, creative and engaging.
(2.) Voices for the characters were well chosen and added to the characters connectivity to the story and the audience.
Negatives:
(1.) The collaboration and underlying egotism amongst the directors, writers and animators was so disjointed that the story lacked cohesiveness with countless storyline holes leaving the nouveau audience with much puzzlement as to what is going on in this story (plot).  We spend so much time asking ourselves what is the source and point of this or that scene that we end up losing the story and more importantly not having an opportunity to appreciate the animation or engaging with the characters as believable entities.
(2.) The color palette for this movie is black and more black which is a cheap and convenient device for creating mood but only seems to work for the people who create a film because they know what's going on even when they can't see what's going on. For the audience, viewing a film for the first time and trying to distill so much information, it makes it much more difficult to understand the movie. In addition the complex, intricate and beautiful scenes fail to be appreciated by the audience because they last so briefly while being barely visible. This is another example of the egotism of the production crew becoming so engrossed in their own world with their high tech equipment that they forget about the lowly audience with TVs that may not meet their studio standards.
(3.) There is nothing new or creative in retelling the same old story of robots destroying humans and leaving an industrial wasteland. The puppets, although not believably explained or developed, were a sufficient enough hook to keep this audience from giving up.

The film projector focus was off a little while watching it in the theater but I still enjoyed the story. I'm sure there could have been more exposition of characters, but the main essence of the movie is survival in an unfamiliar world and the relationships between the characters seemed to reflect this. Trying to understand the detailed lives and relationships of your new comrades kind of takes a back seat to a respectful working relationship when constantly being assaulted by creatures bent on the destruction of you and your comrades. So the story makes sense to me, especially since the movie is about things that occur over a period of about 2-3 days.

Now the Blu-Ray experience is EXCELLENT with this title. 9 has very good visuals (very nice textures and animation sequences, all very sharp of course) but where it really shines is in the audio department. WHooAA! The DTS HD Master Audio presentation has very good attention to detail (eye movement, finger movement, body movement, etc..), very intelligable speech at good levels, nice dynamic use of surrounds, and the low end is incredible - deep reaching, finely articulate, and properly loud bass. This is a top tier audio quality Blu-Ray, and very good in the visuals as well. If you have a really good HT setup it will be a great experience.

But what separates ""9"" from the pack is that unlike ""9"", those films were unable to raise the level of the media beyond that of ""kiddie fare"" or fluff.  ""Igor"" and ""Corpse Bride"" quickly spring to mind-each having had great potential for something dark and appealing but chose instead to squander it away on juvenile dialog, fart jokes, gross out humor or misplaced song and dance numbers.  For the first time (although The Tale of Despereaux came pretty darn close) a darker computer animated film has come along along where the tone of the film actually matches its dark visuals.  I can't stress my appreciation for that enough.

  Make no mistake, ""9"" is not a silly, happy-go-lucky film, nor is it chock full of song and dance numbers, it will not make you laugh, the characters do not burp or fart or burst into annoying song.  That being said, ""9"" is the first of these darker computer animated films I actually liked.  Right from the beginning, the audience is thrust into a dark post-apocalyptic world brimming with danger, intrigue and wonderfully unique characters.  No fart jokes, or silly antics apply here-just an epic journey reminiscent of Lord of the Rings with oddly charming little burlap clockwork people.  Characters are placed in real danger in this film and death is a real threat at every turn.  9's visuals are stunning, the script is well written and the music is fittingly creepy.

3974235,5,B002RD55NK,"This is a post apocalypse story about the struggle of a group of tiny mechanical toys to out live the machines that destroyed the world.

It appears civilization halted sometime around 1940, there appears to have been a great war. We have no idea how much time has gone by between then and when this story begins. The only things still moving are a dinosaur skeleton-like killing machine, and a group of tiny hand made toys that appear to be alive. These toys have numbers painted on their backs (used as names), the higher the number the more advanced they appear to be.

Sometime during the great war, a scientist was forced to build an intelligent machine that has the ability to make any other machines it needs. Suspecting the ability of his machine to be used for evil, the scientist created nine little mechanical toy people to try to save life, and transferred his soul into them giving them life energy but costing him his life after he builds #9. At first the intelligent machine builds military hardware (that looks a lot like something from the 1977 Star Wars or the 2005 War Of The Worlds movies). Eventually it turned against all life killing everything from grass to insects to animals.

The story is thin on details of what came before or why things are the way they are now, sort of a mid-story brief glimpse into this tiny struggle to out-survive the only remaining killing machine. Even though the characters in this film look like cute retro toys this is not a story for little children. While there are no humans and no blood the deaths and the injuries these little folks suffer might be very scary for little humans today. It is likely to be frightening to children because of the realistic expressions of shock and horror on the faces of the toys as they witness the demise of the other toys.

This movie is short, perhaps an hour and a quarter long. It moves along at a good clip and leaves little time with no action. It borrows themes from several prior films, like War of the Worlds, Terminator, and Star Wars. Many of the scenes take place just a few inches above the ground creating a very original perspective for a movie.

Instead, it was a thoughtful and visually impressive film that tells a story that might be a bit heavy handed and might seem simplistic but still does what it's supposed to do. I think some people were pissed because they made it out to be something from one of the two directors (they produced this, they didn't direct) and it wasn't.

Sure, it has that whimsical yet odd feeling that Tim Burton imbues in his films. And yes, there are a couple of nods to Bekmambetov's camera style (he likes moving through cracks and odd spaces to transition from one scene to the next). But, in the end it's more about telling the story and displaying the art of the film.

Maybe I'm biased because I liked the little things that you might not notice right away. For example, the film is a lot more visual. The dialog in places is non-existent, relying on expressions and inference. And, there are really well thought out places like the library where they used a simple but realistic cataloging system (the strings from a specific page lead to the rest of the information).

In the end, this film is more a simple tale set on the backdrop of an alternate timeline with a (heavy-handed) dash of allegory. If you're a fan of 3D animation, you definitely have to see this film. It's not about technology (despite the storyline in the film)...it's more about artistry and doing things like conveying the story without dialog, imagining how a ""new"" world would develop out of the old, and--I guess--thinking about the message the story is trying to hit you over the head with.

If you're looking for a Tim Burton or Timor Bekmambetov movie, this ain't it. Move along.",1262304000,3,2039,4.59065934065934
3974241,5,B002RD55NK,"9 is a burlap man, he wakes to find himself in a laboratory, the humans around him dead and the world we know has suffered an apocalypse. 9 goes out into the world and soon finds friends like him numbered 1 through 8. Together they discover the secret of how the world was destroyed and the reason for their existence while battling ""The Machine."" As the numbers struggle for survival they come to realize that each of them has a piece of the answer to the riddle of their world and they need each other.

The characters are computer generated, and they look like sock puppets but you find yourself very quickly forgetting that, and you start to care about the characters, their plight, their safety, their concerns. Each character is developed as fully as it can, even a couple characterizations that could have safely remained clichs like that of 8, who is a bully and enforcer of 1 is later shown to have some quite human attributes and when the machines attack it is 8 who leaves all differences behind and uses his brawn to save the others. The other characterization that could have remained a clich is that of ""The Machine"" it could have been a static Darth Vader like symbol of all that is bad and evil, but even the ""The Machine"" is shown to have been at one point an innocent that has it's use and functions corrupted.

9 is one of the most pure filmmaking experiences I've had in a long time. 9 started life as a 7-8 minute animated short by Shane Acker. The short didn't have speaking parts, characterization was delivered through expression and body language and 9 the feature film carries on that original intent, although not totally wordless a lot of subtle, nuanced points are shown subtly with expresssion, tone, body language, and doesn't overly rely on the human actors who voice the characters. And the actors who do voice the characters do an excellent job. Christopher Plummer, Crispin Glover, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Elijah Wood all seem to be the perfect casting for the roles.

I read some of the other reviews that suggested 9 is a kids movie, but it doesn't seem to be. Yes, the characters are cute and would seem to have great merchandising potential, but the world revealed in the movie has some depth to it. If you want to let your kids see the movie, I wouldn't hesitate, the darker elements aren't that dark, probably less than the average Disney movie and aren't horrific or traumatizing for younger viewers.

There are plenty of bonus features and they are all around excellent. There are a lot of behind the scenes looks at the creation of the movie talking with everyone from Shane Acker who created the original short and directed the feature. Production designers of every ilk talk about their participation in the movie but it's never boring or too technical. The bonus features include the original short the movie is based on.

As a reviewer you find that good books or movies generate a lot of ideas, questions, and thought as you watch or read, 9 does that extraordinarily well. After watching 9 I think you'll find yourself satisfied with the experience. The only thing I regret is, I wish I had seen this movie before now.",1262217600,2,3178,4.647686832740214
3974242,5,B002RD55NK,"The moment I started watching this I was blown away by the beauty & detail of the animation.  We are presented with a 1940's world where dictators managed to end our world with fantastic machines.  The scientist who made these machines managed to try to preserver human soles in the rag-doll creatures he created.  This is their story, trying to understand who they are & fighting against the evil machines.

This started out as a school project (which is included here in the bonus material) which won an award and got the attention of others, including Tim Burton.  The story was expanded upon, including some back story on the world that led to this apocalypse.  I strongly disagree with others, to me this does NOT feel like a short film expanded & padded out to a feature.  The story is very thoughtful & moves at a rather brisk pace.  You may find the need to watch it again as you feel you missed something.  At around 80 minutes, the story does not drag on.

Consider that the ending comes from the original 10 minute student film (no spoilers here), I doubt this student had any intentions of sequels. Those accusing this film of being the breeder for sequels are just looking too much into the ending.  This is not a Disney movie.

Animation wise, this is quite on par with Pixar & is far above much of what is being produced today. The screen is just loaded with lush details & a perfect pallet of colors that help set the mood for that scene.  Great care was taken to get the right hues.

Don't be fooled by the single disc release, at 80 minutes there is plenty of room for bonus material.  The unused scenes & alternate ending are interesting, but the documentary explaining the process of expanding the original 10 minute film and the use of the voice talent is much better than some on 2-disc releases.  Other documentaries explain the 1940's look, throwing in some modern day gadgets to make you feel there is something different here, and the use of reference video recordings for the action (nothing new about this, Disney did this over 60 years ago).  You will not feel cheated by the single disc release.  O.K., I will admit there are no music videos with pop stars covering the music, nor any kiddie games that get old fast.

I know I will be watching this over & over again to see what new things I will find in it.",1262217600,2,2338,4.471698113207547

If we ever have trouble with Artificial Intelligence, ""9"" indicates, the source of the problem will not be because of a flaw in the intelligence, but rather in the lack of a human spirit working within that intelligence. Ironically, this point is demonstrated best not through the workings of the rather didactic plot, but simply by feeling very much like a movie created by a soulless machine, crossing off checkpoints on the apocalyptic movie list methodically, while bringing nothing new to the proceedings.

Which is odd, because I had genuinely been looking forward to ""9"", but it just seemed to fall flat, like a soda that had been left in the fridge too long, and it's difficult to say why.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>&nbsp;showed us that it was very possible to identify with non-human protagonists - but an investment of time was required, showing the loneliness and hopelessness of post-apocalyptic life, and providing a motivation (like friendship and romance) beyond mere survival. And for sheer adventure movie impact, scores of good post-apocalyptic movies have done a superb job of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, so why does ""9"" fall so flat and short?

Perhaps its because of our lack of attachment to the protagonists, after all - everything feels slightly *off* from the get-go. The titular 9 comes to life in a deserted world, but the strictures of his artificial intelligence are very unclear. Unlike Wall-E, he appreciates (from the get-go) the world through human eyes - he instantly recognizes a dead body on the floor before him and is startled by the implications. His companions, too, have human insight and emotions, but none seem to know who they are or where they come from - a vexing question that the movie continually dodges. Indeed, the movie leaves quite a few technological and philosophical questions unanswered, apparently in service to a rather rushed plot.

""9"" isn't without its good points. Despite the rushed feel of the film, I do appreciate the short length of the film, in a world where most recent movies vie to push the three hour limit. The character 7, too, is a fantastic example of what a Hollywood female can be when given the chance - 7 is a pure ""action girl"" without being singled out as a girl, period (easy enough in a cast with no genders, I suppose). And the movie's experimental, dark nature is appreciated, even if I felt the final product just wasn't as robust as I'd hoped. If you go into ""9"" with medium expectations, you may enjoy the film - just don't go in with the high hopes that I'd had.

3974245,4,B002RD55NK,"Originally an amazing independent animated short by Shane Acker which took him four years to create, it was turned into a full-length motion picture produced by Tim Burton with Acker acting as director. This movie basically juggernauts the concept of ""stitchpunk"".

Set in a post-apocalpytic Earth, the film opens up with a small mechanical humanoid burlap sack(which looks like he's out of Little Big Planet)named 9 awakens in a dilapidated building and finds a strange talisman. After realizing the world is in ruins, he encounters 2, another robot like himself. 2 recognizes the talisman as something special, but gets captured by a large robot cat monster. 9 tries to go after him, but is taken in by the other sack-people, each one of which has its own number. Their leader 1 forbids a rescue attempt on 2, but 9 heads out with 2's friend 5. They manage to destroy the cat-bot with the help of the adventurous 7, and 2 is saved. However, 9 gets the talisman and instictively connects it to a large apparatus called the Fabrication Machine activates and sucks the life out of 2 in the process. 9, 7, and 5 run to an abandonned library run by 3 and 4 where they learn the history of the Fabrication Machine. It was made for a dictator-run country who took it from a scientist to create weapons of mass destruction, which of course later on turn on humanity, where in the end they wipe each other out. The scientist who made it survived long enough to put his soul into to the nine seperate robots which make up the little stitch people. The Machine creates a flying robot to capture the other #s, so they seek to stop the it at its source, but not without 7 and 8 getting captured. They manage to free 7 before torching the place, but 8 gets its soul sucked too. After believing they defeated the enemy, the remaining #s settle back for one of the only really cheery moments on the whole movie, only to find out that the Machine survived, which takes 5 and 6 souls too. 9 goes back to the scientist's room where he first awoke to find the secret of the Machine's power. 9 manages to rip the talisman from it after 1 hastily sacrafices himself. The remaining #s then set the souls of the departed ones free into the heavens.

The movie is a pretty direct adaptation of Acker's original short movie, except it actually adds the other #s into it, and expands on the whole reason for why the world is the way it is. The animation is very well executed in this, although not much on the Pixar level. It might give off the appearance of a stop-motion production, which is nothing new for Tim Burton, even if it seems to help and sometimes hurt the film in when there are times that they could've elaborated more on the plot and characters instead of going from one chase scene to another. But, the characters are really intriguing, and the dark feel of this forbiding world they live in. There's also a fine sense of scale for these diminutive robots in a land of dead giants. It's a great achievement for having an independent production turned into a feature film. The only real major problem with the movie is that it is a little too short, as minus the closing credits it clocks in about 70 minutes, where they could've added a little more interaction with some of the characters and expanded the plot a little more. But, I'd still recommend this for someone looking for a mature sci-fi adventure film, with some great metaphysical aspects to keep the philosphers happy too.",1262131200,3,3475,4.54066985645933

3974247,2,B002RD55NK,"For someone who is in love with all things odd and strange this world has to offer you can believe me when I say that I was very excited for this film. The original short film was a work of beauty...a thrilling experience born from the love and passion of visual story telling. The characters did not speak because they did not have to, their expressions, animations, and their environment told the story for them. What ended up being a triumph of independent film making made a mediocre full length film which threw out everything that made the original so successful. The first problem being of course the characters. Like they are portrayed in the film feel hollow and uninspired. Through out the film I found a hard time caring about them at all. I didn't sympathize for them, like them, or believe in them. Hiring ""big name"" voice actors for any film is an immediate strike to any animated films credibility. You hear a voice and instantly all you can think about is their role in other films. Most notably Elijah Wood, who incidentally plays almost an identical character in Lord of The Rings...the main character 9 is a Frodo beanie baby.

The story has many glaring plot holes and the whole experience is muddled by an anti climatic finish which leaves you feeling almost embarrassed to have sat through the whole film.

There is one positive to the whole movie and that's the visual design. While the cg texture work and lighting leave much to be desired the over all aesthetic look of the film is unique and worth mentioning, which is a shame when you have to wallow through the muck to enjoy the scenery.

""9"" is without a doubt one of the most disappointing films I've seen in a decade. All I can remember is the opening line from the trailer... ""We showed so much promise, so much potential...""

How ironic this is how the film would leave me feeling...like a botched opportunity for something great.

All together ""9"" is a forgettable experience which is fortunate because you honestly won't care to remember anything about it after sitting through this abomination.",1262044800,14,2080,4.6876712328767125

I'm going to say know your kid and how they will react to that sort of thing before saying yes or no. If your kid is scared of the boogie man and imagines monsters in the shadows, review this one on your own first.

This iffy review aside, there's a lot of hopes for this movie if sequels actually do happen.  Stephen Kings the Gunslinger, when I read it, I knew it was a good book, but I didn't know why.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These days, the ""producer"" tag is thrown around like Lindsey Lohan's baby sister. It's a good marketing ploy: pay a well known director to use his or her name so people can say, ""a film by so-and-so,"" without actually lying. It's a hype-builder technique, and sometimes the film lives up to it.

  Guillermo Del Toro ""produced"" The Orphanage, and it was almost as amazing as Pan's Labyrinth. Quentin Tarantino produced Iron Monkey, and I fell asleep for the first time during a kung-fu movie. Martin Scorsese produced You Can Count On Me, and I was mesmerized(granted, it didn't have much Scorsese flair.) John Carpenter produced the only Halloween movie without Michael Myers, Halloween III: Season of The Witch. So, it's a hit-or-miss situation. In the movie 9, we miss, but barely.

  Who's the big director for this film? Some guy who did animation for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King named Shane Acker. That's no small role, considering how seamless the CGI really was in that trilogy, but please, from that to directing a feature-length animation that would be awe-inspiring? Not too well thought out.

  The story, as far as I could tell, goes like this: SkyNet takes over the world with their hunter-killer Terminator robots, finally killing off the human race in order to rust in peace for eons. One survivor, a scrawny scientist, creates a gang of ragdolls called ""stitchpunks"" to take back what's left of the world in order to...collect mildew in peace. These ragdolls, in fact, have been infused with the scientist's soul using some weird-looking bottlecap, and it is up to the last of them, 9, to gather the group to fight SkyNet's mother brain, and make the world safe for life to bloom again.

  Confused? I was, too, especially when Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't make one cameo.

  Visually, the movie is amazing. All of the animation has a full, textured feel that made me think, ""Woah, is this claymation with fabric?"" This was not the case, but it really was that good. Post-apocalyptic Earth was vast and colorful. Action sequences were intense. In this sense, Tim Burton should be proud to have this movie attached to his name.

  The story, unfortunately, acts like filler for a visual juggernaut. It treaded a certain middle ground, when it would have been best served on one side or the other in terms of plot vagueness. Let me explain.

  9 starts the viewer off in what seems to be another unknown world, just like the namesake ragdoll, #9. This is always an interesting concept, as you learn things as the character learns them, and are always wondering what happens next.

  For a while, the movie stays this course. Then, closer to the end, the movie feels the need to explain the history of the world in 20 seconds, completely nullifying the feelings you have at the beginning of the movie. If they kept the movie going on its own terms without the need to slap the viewer in the face with an explanation, this movie would have been amazing. Instead, we get rushed to the end for the big, awe-inspiring soul theme. What a waste.",1260230400,9,3276,4.875226039783001
3974254,4,B002RD55NK,"People who have little imaginations and are stuck in their conventional expectations will not like this film. It IS for smart kids(with intelligent parents who can explain it to them) maybe age 7 and up. It's beautifully dark in the same way that parts of ""Dark Crystal"" and ""Legend"" are, the story isn't meant to be Bergman-esque(it's on the simple side,but entertaining), and FOR ONCE the CGI used is NOT overly-noticeable,choppy,and distracting!

I was surprised how seamless the CGI was actually; most Pixar et al. flicks really strike a sour note with me as the CGI limitations often speak louder than the story.

The score wasn't epic, but didn't detract from the story and fit well.

The story itself was basic (but it should be for kids), and FINALLY a kid film didn't rely on conventional humor for comedy! That's another thing I HATE about the Pixars: kid jokes that are meant to be hip and quirky but instead are hopelessly obnoxious, and adult humor that never ventures beyond the comedy palette of the soccer mom. The funny parts in ""9"" are not over-abundant and don't steamroll you over as the fast-cut scenes fly by;instead the comedy is often physical and never trendy.

Bottom line in my opinion:smart parents will show this to their older kids and have fun with it, without having to worry about the same-old stupid kid flick conventions that ruin kids' imaginations. Your average person browsing the kid shelves at Blockbuster, however, will bring this home and inevitably turn it off after the first 10 minutes in favor of ""Dancing with the Stars"" or the Disney Channel because they don't have the imaginative capacity to understand films like these.",1260057600,12,1670,4.890459363957597

The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices??

How, what, when, why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater.

A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect.

Granted, I didn't hate it... it didn't offend me, although I felt gypped. The animation is not as mind-blowing as people have said. At least, no more mind-blowing than anything Pixar has put out.

The biggest problem with 9 is the writing. Most of the lines in the film are cliche to the extent of being hilariously bad -- just as laughable as the cliche little personalities of the characters 1 through 9. I was literally laughing out loud when I think I should have been... I dunno... moved? Crying? Hiding my tears in order to seem tough?

You have one character that repeats the same cryptic line, ""Go back to the source! Go back to the source,"" like some kind of jerk. And that's JUST the thing with this movie -- without giving too much away about the plot or how the movie ends -- the characters are very one-dimensional. They each have their own way of responding to things, and they never develop, change, or progress throughout the movie. I feel as though the writer is trying too hard to emphasize each character's uniqueness, and it becomes overkill after not-too-long. Only at the conclusion of the movie does it become apparent why the writer wrote for each of the characters in this way. Until then, the movie is frustrating to watch. I think it would have been less frustrating if the ""big reveal"" at the end was part of the plot all along. At least then I could empathize with the characters instead of becoming irritated.

Some people (either on IMDB or here on Amazon -- I don't remember) said that the viewer just needed to think about what was being said, etc. That's fine & dandy, but really, this is one movie that I just didn't find to be very profound.

3974260,3,B002RD55NK,"Released on 9/9/09, 9 is computer animated film about 9 rag dolls, the sole ""survivors"" of a war-ravaged alternate universe, given life through a magical talisman invented by an aged scientist. Termed ""stitchpunk"" by its fans, it blends the aesthetics of a steampunk world (resembling WWII-era Western Europe) with science fiction, action, and some mysticism/ancient metaphysics. At 80 minutes, it is short.

Yes, the CG-work is absolutely fantastic and masterfully crafted, but what about the story? The theme of technology turning against us is a familiar one in sci-fi, especially anime. A well-meaning scientist invents an artificially intelligent robot capable of creating other machines, but it is soon made to create machines of war by an evil chancellor. World war starts, and the machines soon start exterminating humanity. The art direction is taken directly from Nazi-era Germany, depicting a corrupt and technology-obsessed military regime, complete with red, white, and black flags and insignias. The robot walkers are shaped like German infantry helmets. This part of the story is shown way too quickly, only as a flashback and a film news reel lasting a few minutes. More time could've been spent explaining this plot element and why the machines started killing all of mankind, and the resistance against them. There is not enough story development here and I feel this is a real weakness of the film. It's presented as a given that the machines just took over and destroyed the world, without showing you the protracted struggle against them by military forces.

Instead, all we know is the world is destroyed somehow and all that's left are the dolls and some machines hunting them down. What follows is one battle scene or chase after another as they try to find sanctuary. They're cool battle sequences with some fantastic mechanical design, but they don't flesh out the characters. I would've liked to see how they survived during the war before 9 came.

9 didn't do very well at the box office or with critics, and I can see perhaps why. Maybe it was the mishandled marketing strategy that left people confused. Some viewers mistook the film as being directed or designed by Tim Burton and were disappointed, an easy thing to do from casually glancing at the movie poster and seeing his name in big letters at the top, or because of the Oogie Boogie-like (doll 8). Being a first-time feature director, few moviegoers have heard of Shane Acker and the marketers tried to ride Burton's coattails and to a lesser extent, Russian director, Timur Bekmambetov's (Wanted, Daywatch, Night Watch).

Maybe it was CG fatigue on the part of the audience, who are tired of the endless streams of CG animations every year. Certainly, the movie poster didn't do anything to pique my interest or differentiate it from a sea of other CG/sci-fi films produced every year. Because of its apocalyptic wasteland setting and artificial lifeforms, some people also unfairly compared the film to Wall-E. And for its ragdolls and dark vision, 9 suffered comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coraline/dp/B00288KNJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coraline</a>&nbsp;as well (from steampunk icon Neil Gaiman). Or maybe it was just the character design of the dolls. 9 looks like Sack Boy from the popular PS3 game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LittleBigPlanet/dp/B001IVXI7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LittleBigPlanet</a>, right down to the zipper and burlap cloth texture, but he's not cute at all. This film is definitely not for kids. All the dolls are a bit creepy looking. For example, 5 has a metal plate sewn over half his head from a wound. We have dark, apocalyptic landscapes, and depictions of humans getting mowed down and gassed by the machines. Half of the dolls die in the film, shown in a visually disturbing manner. We also see their corpses.

All in all, 9 is a competently produced and highly detailed world, but the alone doesn't sell the story, which is just a notch above average. Voice acting is done very well, with the exception of a dull John C. Riley. Worth a look if you like dark sci-fi and action-filled animation, but otherwise totally skippable.

3974261,5,B002RD55NK,"This was a great movie that kind of came and went in a flash in theaters.

The tone is dark and apocalyptic but the story is engaging with enough fantasy elements to keep the wonder factor high.

9 revolves around an world where a ruthless dictatorship straight out of 1984 has unleashed thinking machines that have touched off a war with humanity. During which, apparently, all of mankind has been wiped out. However one scientist was able to create a set of dolls and infuse them with his spirit and they are all that is left of us as a species.

The machines still hunt through the ruins looking for enemies to destroy and these living dolls are on the menu. But when doll #9 finally awakens, it may be time for the status quo to change.

I really enjoyed this film and recommend it highly. I would say the film is suitable for teens and older. There's nothing of a graphic nature but the themes and tone is a bit dark for younger tastes. All in all an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",1258156800,2,997,4.315508021390374
3974262,5,B002RD55NK,Finally a big budget animated movie for grown ups! I saw this movie twice in the theaters and I wish I had gone to see it once more. Simple story that makes you think and also leaves you to wonder. Each character serves a purpose and you immediately become immersed in the dark forbidding setting. The eerie setting and chilling creatures are unsettling and fascinating. This is a visually mesmerizing and thought provoking film that may not appeal to all audiences but certainly appealed to this movie goer!,1257638400,19,508,4.784090909090909
3974263,2,B002RD55NK,"This is not an animated movie for children. It has a darker backstory about the death of humanity. The movie seemed like the story painted itself into a corner and tied its hands from what could have been amazing. I will give examples further into the review.

The plot of this post apocalyptic sci-fi movie is about 9 little dolls made of hackysack material (that are really robots underneath) try to stop an evil machine that makes twisted little, evil machine animals using old parts. Basically, this evil machine has destroyed all life on Earth along with every human. There is nothing alive on Earth but these 9 ""sack boys."" The scientist that created the evil super machine to win a war also made these 9 sack dolls. The evil machine creates a single twisted robotic creature at a time to find and kill all of the living dolls. Once one twisted robotic creature is destroyed, another is created. So its lather, rinse, repeat.

There are a wide variety of evil robotic creatures sent out to destroy the heroes (one at a time of course). Each creature seems to have something taken from the movie ""Toy Story."" Things like doll heads, bird skeletons and tinker toys that made up the bodies. It really felt like someone saw ""Toy Story,"" had a nightmare about it and wrote the movie. Because of this fact, the movie just doesn't feel very original.

There is a rich back story that it seems like has been done before (and better) by other movies. The back story is divvied bit by bit, all while introducing the 9 sack boys one at a time until the twins. First is 9, ""the unknowing hero,"" then its 2, ""the informant,"" 1, ""the leader who is strict in not facing the evil machine,"" 4 is the brutal thug of a sack boy puppet with a giant blade that enforces the wishes of 1, the list goes on and on. Their personalities were stereotypes with no deviation, but how can there be deep personalities when their sole purpose for existence is to survive?

The visuals are good, but it really lacked life. Of course how much life could there be when killer robots destroyed all life on planet Earth? The entire movie is devoid of blues and the color pallet seems to consist of mostly browns. There are bright greens, but not with plants, instead with the souls that get stolen out of the sack boy puppets. The ""sack boy dolls"" themselves seemed stolen from the Playstation game ""Little Big Planet,"" only the video game has more charm with its ""sack boy"" of a main character.

You can skip this movie, its okay! You are not missing much. When I saw it in theaters with my two friends, one of them thought it was a very ""meh"" movie. My other friend felt like she had seen the story before. Tim Burton's name was plastered all over the commercials, but in reality, he is 1 of 4 producers. I have a feeling that he gave nothing more than money for the movie.",1257379200,12,2844,4.461538461538462
3974264,4,B002RD55NK,"There are times to simply watch a movie for the sake of being entertained.  I watched this film and found the premise interesting and the characters distinctive. I had no expectations of finding special meaning or absolute logic in the film. That was not my objective.  If you are looking for the explanation of life.  Steer clear.  If you are looking for a fresh approach in filmmaking with an interesting story that is both fun and intriguing, give this movie a try.  I enjoyed it for what it is and not for what it's not.",1256947200,,524,4.473684210526316
3974265,3,B002RD55NK,"From what I've heard, 9 is pretty much the short story extended into a full length animated feature film. I never read the short story, so I just had the film to fall back on. I went with a group of friends and it seemed like a good portion of them were bothered by some of the voice actors in the film. Elijah Wood and John C. Reilly being the main ones that stuck out. It is a bit hard to hear or see Elijah Wood in anything without thinking of Frodo from Lord of the Rings. It just seems like an odd departure for John C. Reilly since we've seen him in mostly PG-13 (Talladega Nights) and R-rated (Step Brothers and Walk Hard) comedies, as of late. To tell the truth though, neither one really bothered me. I got sucked into the film pretty easily and while I already knew about Elijah Wood, the entire voice cast (especially Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer, and Crispin Glover) seemed to fit their roles pretty well. So that didn't really seem to be an issue.

What did catch me off guard, however, was how short 9 was. The film isn't even 80 minutes long, which is only slightly longer than Cloverfield. The length of the film doesn't usually bother me if it's at least an hour and a half long, but paying around $10 for a film this short seems a bit steep. So that may be something to take into account if you decide you want to see this film. I highly suggest either seeing the matinee or waiting to see the film on DVD for this purpose alone.

The film itself was pretty enjoyable and exactly what the trailers advertised it would be. The animation is pretty spectacular as each fiber on the rag dolls is animated to a certain extent and the action scenes almost make you feel like you're right in there with them. The story is decent if you don't put much thought into it, but it felt a bit rushed and incomplete at times. The ending is obviously left open-ended for potential sequel purposes (but what would they call it? 9(2)?) Each doll stands out on their own and has their own personality so they're easy to distinguish from one another. Needless to say, the majority of the characters are given a chance to shine in the film. The designs of the machines, what they're made of, and how they're made was also interesting to watch. The film's length is a bummer on one hand, but good on the other as it's too short to really lose interest in anything that's going on.

9 throws you head first into a dark, animated, post-apocalyptic world that makes you want to stay strapped in through all of its twists and turns. While the film may be shorter than expected and the story isn't as developed as it probably should be, it's still an entertaining ride that most people will find entertaining.",1253750400,3,2706,4.386454183266932
3974266,3,B002RD55NK,"1) Features an interesting post-war world with lots of steampunk creations.

2) Movie can't seem to decide who its target audience is: The setting is a bit too dark and serious for kids and the characters are too shallow and hard to identify with for adults.

3) Lots of eye candy and ""boss battles"", as if this movie were made with video games in mind.

4) Storyline is pretty cliche and stereotypical.

5) Some interesting characters, such as the twins and the Michelin Tire guy . . .

6) . . . but what is up with the Michelin Tire guy's ""magnetic mast*rbation???""

7) Voice acting from Elijah Wood and Jennifer Connelly.

8) Whether you like this movie or not, it's very short in length--roughly an hour and a half.

9) In my final estimation, ""9"" is not bad, not great, but a decent way to spend a lazy evening.",1253664000,2,816,4.3933333333333335
3974267,4,B002RD55NK,"Shane Acker's new film, coincidentally scheduled to release on 9/9/09, is in interesting bit of political fantasy.  Probably ever since the Machine was invented, man feared they would take over. In this case, the film's situation is the direct result of a philanthropic Scientist who created a Machine for the good of the State.  Unfortunately, it all went wrong.

9 awakens--not quite Machine and not quite Man, either, to find others of his kind.  He wants to learn as much as he can about the machines, but Wise Old 1 does everything he can to prevent the newest member of their troup from doing so. The eventual conflict and end is both heartwarming and disturbing.

Well worth the time if you like science fiction oddities.  May be too disturbing for your younger kids--under 7 or so.

3974268,1,B002RD55NK,"I seriously can't believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this dreck. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest I've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", which is one I've watched multiple times, and directed movies like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE: Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director.

Those two people producing one of the many reasons I was excited to see 9. So today I went to go see it at the theater. I was so excited to finally have seen it. I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out.

This movie is the first time I've walked out of a Tim Burton-related movie and said ""I enjoyed almost NONE of that"". I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I mean, with him and Bekmambetov at the production helm you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch. Right now I still can't get over how let down I was by this movie. I hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now, I can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie. Hell, Neil Blomkamp made an AWESOME full length remake of Alive in Joburg entitled District 9, what was so hard to get right about 9??? I really wanted to think this movie was awesome. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels.

The plot was extremely confusing and disjointed. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. Basically it's about a bunch of ragdoll robots trying to save the earth. Well, OK, that's what I got from it. But the writing here is extremely poor. The whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with A.D.D. telling a story. There's this big, giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens, causing destruction and stuff. That's the main villain. However, what else is wrong with this movie is that EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. There were too many monster robots, most of which have no logical explanation behind them. They have 0 development whatsoever. I mean, that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere, we have no idea where it comes out of and Acker just expects us to know what it is. What was even more retarded was that snake-like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize. I dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh. All of the 3 people I told about it burst out laughing. Oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it. I'M. NOT. KIDDING.

*WARNING- HERE BE SPOILERS*

The twist in Act III is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie. So basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in, finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9, and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth, but then evil humans use it for war, and it was supposed to help protect the earth, but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it. And HE ONLY MENTIONS GIVING HIS LIFE TO 9. But what about the other robots? WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THEM???????? This is the perfect example of poor, rushed writing. There's only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them??????? The characters are not likable at all either. They risk their lives for no reason at all. The only good character is 7. 6 annoyed me with his ""GO BACK TO THE SOURCE!!!!!!"" ramblings, 1 is an overpowering idiot, 2 we don't know ANYTHING about, 5 kept annoying me with his ""Are you sure..."" or ""Can I stay here instead...?"" questions. And that ending? UGH. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge WTF moment.

*END SPOILER*

There's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation. Everything looks realistic and beautiful, I love the gloomy and depressing look of everything. However, beauty can't save a good movie.

While it's true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. I'm sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theater to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetov's names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theater to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content.
