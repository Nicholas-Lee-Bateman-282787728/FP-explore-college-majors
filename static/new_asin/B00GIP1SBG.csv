8623570,4,B00GIP1SBG,"Odd pairing of two very good films with little in common under the (Valentine's Day?) marketing banner 'Love Me Forever Double Feature,' which, contrary to Amazon's specs, contains two DVDs rather than one.  Top billed is Leo McCarey's quintessential Hollywood tearjerker 'An Affair to Remember' (Fox, 1957) starring screen legends Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr (4 stars).  The disc is taken from 2007's '50th Anniversary' edition (which also features a second disc of bonus material, missing here), complete with sometimes informative but more often self-indulgent commentary by biographer/essayist Joseph McBride.  The second, lesser known film is Elia Kazan's 'Wild River' (Fox, 1960), which-- while arguably overstuffed with socio-political portents and a love story that are never fully explored-- offers an eyeful of gorgeous Tennessean location photography and extraordinarily thoughtful performances by principals Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick and Jo Van Fleet (4 stars).  Richard Schickel provides languid, occasionally inspired commentary.  Sound and video-restoration quality is excellent for both movies.",1423785600,3,1113,6.018987341772152
