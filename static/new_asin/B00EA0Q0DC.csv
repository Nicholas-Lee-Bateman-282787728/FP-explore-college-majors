5899401,3,B00EA0Q0DC,"I watched the 2 disc DVD set and was a bit disappointed. Although Mangini is a superb drummer, he does A LOT of talking in his video and a lot less playing than I expected from him. In reality, it comes down to your individual preference as to whether or not you'll enjoy this DVD. What I mean is, I'm more of a visual learner and I desired to see more physical sticking and playing but instead, Mike spends a large deal of time in monologue and discussing the different categories that exists within his grid system which- again- as preference would have it, wasn't a huge help for me. To be honest, I wanted to be blasted with a metaphorical Mangini Gatling gun that would demonstrate his true prowess and physical skill behind the kit and be a source of inspiration for me. I was not catered to unfortunately. I suggest you save your cash and purchase something better...like a baby monkey or whatever. As for me, I guess I'll try to record over the 2-disc set with some soap operas or maybe play fetch with my hounds. Don't buy it!",1388188800,,1035,4.395833333333333
5899402,1,B00EA0Q0DC,"Mangini must have needed some extra pocket change. He seems mostly to ad lib this session, moving seamlessly from inane descriptions of the genres he's playing and of the things he's got in his head when he's improvising to demonstrations that are here for beginners and there for technical experts. This is DEFINITELY not a session for beginners, but it's not clear to me who really CAN gain by listening to Mangini ramble from topic to topic with no clear educational plan in mind. I suppose if I were a drummer with strong technical skills already (which I'm not) and weak ability to improvise, this might help, but I sincerely doubt it. There are a lot of recorded lessons out there and most of them are pedagogically more effective than this one.",1387065600,4,751,4.696969696969697
5899403,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"Mike Mangini is a technical guru. His insight into styles, technique and use of a huge drumkit is truly inspiring and relevant. Above all he is a great teacher. This is a great DVD for anyone who wants to keep growing as a drummer, but more importantly, as a musician.",1385683200,3,268,4.38
5899404,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"Mike Mangini is an amazing player that has the ability to explain to us what he is doing. The fact that a bulk of the material is presented without editing is a testament to this.
The concept of a ""grid"", is so helpful in being able to see where one is going. I just attended a convention where the daily schedule was posted on a large board in the form of a grid. It was so easy to navigate where and when you would like to be. Never, would I have thought that someone would be able to do this with a subject as mysterious as ""creativity"". Mangini has done it with excellent results.",1384819200,7,584,4.131578947368421
5899405,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"FANTASTIC!  Great teaching manner and ability to break down complex time signatures and drum patterns.  Shows great enthusiasm for subject matter.  ""Excellent everything he does"".  Not for beginners.",1384300800,6,199,6.0
8603099,2,B00EA0Q0DC,"Ehhhh, i didn't think this was that great.  Over the past year now i have been ""going hard"" on learning the drums and i consider myself a low intermediate player by now.  I really enjoyed both of Tommy Igoe's ""Groove Essentials"", and ""Drums for Dummies"" by Jeff Strong.  This DVD talks about stuff that is already fairly IMPLICIT in the understanding of drums.  It is implicit that you subscribe to a time signature, use certain limbs, styles, drum pieces.  Mangini highlights all these things and just encourages you to reflect on them so that when it comes time to improvise you don't have to think about them.  It wasn't very practical in my opinion and in my stage.... but even if you are more advanced, I don't think there is a lot to get from this.  Mangini seems a bit neurotic and its just him talking a lot.  But he seems like a nice guy and obviously he's an amazing drummer.",1470182400,,885,4.453416149068323

8603101,5,B00EA0Q0DC,Arrived quickly.  Mangini is a Master Musician.  In my opinion this course is for advanced level drummers.,1437782400,,106,5.176470588235294
8603102,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"I'm giving this 5 stars because Mangini is a talented player. This 2 DVD set is of some value, but I don't think it will help much for players that are just trying to play regular tunes and/or are beginners. For the more advanced players, that do have rudiments and grooving already mastered as second nature, this DVD gives some good insights on how to approach improvisations with less of an 'improvised' feel, as using the ""grid"" as he says, kind of constrains the 'improvisation' aspect of playing. The way Mangini talks can be tiring after a while, but that's just the way he is, so just pause when his blabber starts bringing your eye lids down.

Not related to his work on this DVD, but I have to say: Endorsements aside, it's hard for me to believe that Mangini thinks those cymbals sound any better than used trash can lids. I mean, they sound **very** low quality. He has an A Custom ride on his left side that sounds a little more professional, but overall his cymbal sounds are at student level at best. He should try Paiste cymbals, but that's just my personal opinion, I like quality.

So, if you're a Dream Theater fan AND a Drummer, I recommend this DVD. If you're not a drummer but want to be one, you'll get frustrated very fast.

It isn't easy to make an instructional DVD, especially when the ideas and concepts have to be translated into words - one needs to be relaxed and have a road map and a very good arsenal of words to be able to pull it off without sounding stupid. Mike pulls it off, although sometimes borderline nerdy, but it is worth it for what it is -- an exploration on how one of the greatest drummers alive today thinks, when it comes to improvising on the drum set.",1406678400,4,1704,4.4031746031746035
8603103,5,B00EA0Q0DC,You can walk away with a new approach to drumming and feel great about the way you play. I'm better just after watching it. I must buy!,1400025600,,135,4.037037037037037
8603104,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"If you love theory and gain knowledge about drumming, this DVD is perfect. Mangini is a great teacher. You feel like being at Berklee College having classes with him. He is really nice! Once you watch this video, you will know why it won a DRUMMIE. I have to say that among all the instructional videos about drumming I have watched, this is the best, really. Mangini tells you a lot about so many different aspects that you are amazed all the time, from start to finish. MANGINI RULES!",1399939200,,486,4.47191011235955
8603105,5,B00EA0Q0DC,"Mikes instructional DVD is very well sophisticatedly planned out.
Each one of his systems are very organized and performed well. You must really need to pay attention.
I would say in a way  that his speech and demonstration for each system is almost mathematical.
Of course all percussion writing is mathematical when we are counting in subdivisions correct?
So if you are serious about learning this system I suggest that you break it down into part acts.
I would recommend this to anyone who has studied the instrument and is a fine reader of percussion music.
You would also have to understand subdivisions, style, and music theory.
Good luck to all that purchased this DVD.

GREAT JOB MIKE.  Chuck",1390176000,,155,3.4285714285714284
8603108,5,B00EA0Q0DC,Mangini is a powerhouse drummer that will go down in history as one of the most important drummers that ever lived. The way that he has pushed technique with power and speed all the while maintaining musical sensibility is just mind blowing. A truly great buy.,1389139200,,260,4.673913043478261
