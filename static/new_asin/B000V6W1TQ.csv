8216916,4,B000V6W1TQ,"How much is Shakespeare neglected in our Fakedbook time. The DVD come on time and  I would recommend it to anyone who is in present situation Lost Obama in The White House , Georgie Busch on his ranch and disenfranchised  terrorists in Guantanamo. All would find in the cast their part to have.  On this DVD I found the cast rather uncomplimentary  the Duke is rather disappointing - the Timothy Dalton would fit that role better as you might agree with me  duke is by his mild manner and sublimate un-wholeness of body language towards a script not dramatically coherent,  almost as Zbigniev Brzezinski  being a US president. Over period of the time this play still has a great potential what over the cast deficiency, it is full of life what might have a chance to be remade for audience now, to see it more regularly on a stage to cultivate critical perspective on our Vienna Ferguson  times. Similarity to Rigolleto tragedy it has what makes the eternal plot of selfishness  interesting.",1419033600,2,991,4.715116279069767
