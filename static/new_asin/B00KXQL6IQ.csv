6453576,4,B00KXQL6IQ,"Another well-made documentary from Sebastian Junger.  The soldiers who were interviewed honestly share their hopes, frustrations in dealing with people who could smile at you one day then shoot at you the next, anxieties about returning home and finding jobs, and the camaraderie that sometimes even trumps familial bonds.  Through it all, these soldiers bravely carry out their duties, knowing the day could be their last.",1409270400,8,423,5.393939393939394
6453577,5,B00KXQL6IQ,"It is difficult to click five stars and read the promt that says ""love this film"" because of the serious subject matter, But indeed, this film earn five stars.
I saw this on the second day of it's release in NYC, with director and one of the subjects who was featured in the film.
The film is gripping, gives a raw and intimate perspective of how the soldiers day to day lives are while deployed. How they go for days without anything to see, or do but entertain each other. The contrast is on some days, the gun shots and explosions and fighting is intense. It is difficult to imagine going from one extreme to the other as they do again and again.
Listening to the question and answer part of the premier, I learned that many of the soldiers, including the one speaking wtth Junger,  have a difficult time hearing the words ""thank you"". That they did not necessirly do it for patriotism but, for their own personal reasons. Not that there are no patriots out fighting but many, have other personal reasons for being there. Once they are there, it is for the ""guy to the left and, guy to the right"" that keeps them there, their brothers in arms.  I learned that this soldier would prefer hearing the words ""welcome home"" instead of the ""thanks"".
This movie was compelling, and informative and shared important insight that non-miltary members could use. It really fills in the blanks where Restrepo left off.
I highly recoomend this movie and thank those in it for serving.
Welcome home!",1409270400,33,1488,4.569288389513108
6453578,4,B00KXQL6IQ,"Consider this the psychology companion piece to Restrepo. Whereas Restrepo was about what war ""is"" like, Korengal is more about, as the cover's subtitle says, what war ""feels"" like. Interviews and discussion of the soldiers who were stationed at Restrepo serve as the backbone for this documentary. So regardless of your take on war, keep in mind that Korengal does not hesitate to handle the topic from both sides of the coin, as you'll see later in the film's interviews, if you decide to watch it.

This film delivers an impressive character study from beginning to end. It makes good on the promise from the director that Korengal emphasizes the understanding over the experience. With that said, it's more reflective than it is intense, so the visual chaos of war gets set aside in favor of what the soldiers themselves have to say. For those deciding on watching it, know that this is not a war film in the most visual sense. It lacks the military intricacies and organization of Restrepo, but that it is the point; Korengal and Restrepo are really meant to complement one another. So if you enjoyed the latter, it's worth watching the more abstract Korengal, for the sake of diving deeper into the minds of these soldiers.",1408579200,49,1229,4.797169811320755

Anyone who thinks war would be super fun and exciting needs to see this. The interviews with the soldiers (especially at the end) show you what it does to people. War is a nightmare, and Korengal really drives that home.",1501545600,,341,4.428571428571429
6453584,4,B00KXQL6IQ,"I am currently reading Sebastian Jungers War, and this documentary is a companion piece to the book (as is Restrepo).  First of all, the book is excellent and if you have an interest in this story, Id highly recommend it.  That said, this review is not about the book but rather the documentary.  To me the film is quite good.  I watched it mainly because it was on Netflix and I wanted to see what some of the characters of the book looked like.  As others noted, this is much less an action film than a story about these mens personal experiences in the Korengal Valley during their deployment.  There are some action scenes but this is more about what the men thought and felt.  Many of the conversations and vignettes are repeated in the book, but not so much so that I found it overly  repetitive or mundane (the book of course also contains many things not in the documentary).  Ive seen Restrepo already but intend to revisit it as well, and consider it, the book, and this film to be mandatory for anyone wanting to understand the experience of the war in this time and place.",1499644800,,1084,4.434343434343434

6453685,4,B00KXQL6IQ,"I never watched Restrepo [now that I've seen Korengal I'll probably go backward and view that one as well] but just the day before, I had watched ""Jarhead 2"".  The difference was like seeing the same landscape night and day.  Korengal really is a documentary, while Jarhead 2 is a Hollywood-fictional movie, and the difference is obvious.

Korengal opens with views of the Restrepo OP (the post the Marines operated from in Korengal valley) being blown up and burning down.  As part of the troop drawdown in Afghanistan, a decision was made to pull out.  From there, the film goes back to up-close and personal views and interviews with the members of the same platoon previously depicted in Restrepo.  This is not an ""action film"" although you do see footage of the guys on patrol, meeting with village elders, firing at the enemy, or hearing shots being fired at them.  There's also plenty of footage of them inside the post doing what they can to relieve boredom: playing some video games, wrestling, playing guitar etc.  But the heart of the film is each member of the platoon talking to the interviewer about what their tour has been like and how it has affected them: why they signed up, did they ever expect to be in Korengal, are they happy or unhappy to be there, what's it like taking leave; what's it like coming back from leave; will they re-enlist or not; how often do they feel afraid; how do they cope with their fears; what buddies they've seen killed or seriously injured; are there any friends or family back stateside they feel they can talk with about what it's like [almost uniformly: NO]; do they trust the villagers they talk to and so on.
The ""special features"" to this film are slender.  Besides one trailer, there's one 13 minute long segment of the documentarian discussing one of the ""taboo"" subjects of war: that despite seeing close friends killed or seriously hurt, despite the lousy conditions, the prolonged isolation at the post, the constant wondering when is the next time you're going to be fired at, and whether that will be the end, that even guys with significant PTSD symptoms often say, when asked if they'd like to go back, that yes, they'd go back right now if they could.  The lecturer stresses one big reason why: that after the combat experience, nothing else in life feels as real, and that the bonds you form with your fellow platoon members are the closest bonds you've ever felt in life.  When you have to rely on each other every single day to survive; when all of you know that the guy next to you would sacrifice his own life trying to save yours, and likewise you'd pay the ultimate price trying to save him--the intensity of the bonds you feel there are unmatched by any other relationships, even with your wife, your kids, your mom, dad, brothers or sisters or closest stateside friends.  He does not dwell on some of the other reasons--the great difficulty feeling like you fit in anymore when you come back from a war zone, or the addiction to the intense adrenaline rush of combat, intensified when you know you just took out the guy that was trying to kill you.

The technology of war obviously has changed radically, just in the last couple hundred years, but I think some of the emotions discussed in the film are common to pretty much every soldier who ever fought in a war.  That, plus a view of what this particular zone actually looked like, and its significance to the Taliban, make for a sometimes rather cerebral but compelling story.",1418169600,6,3504,4.639741518578353

6453687,5,B00KXQL6IQ,An all around incredible follow up to the Restrepo documentary. Korengal gets deeper into the emotional and psychological aspects of war and how the men come away from the valley. With lots of one on one commentaries from the men who fought their the viewer gets deep insight into how combat creates the deepest friendships nobody outside of combat will experience. The viewer also gets to experience their stories and watch amazing footage from deployments. Fantastically filmed with 100% respect for these brave groups of men.,1416614400,,528,5.151162790697675

I highly hate the people who are puttinf soldiers trained for war to fight ebola. That is a complete waste of their training when the terrorists are running around using our equipment against innocent civilians. Considering they fight for our right to choose. They should have the first opportunity to choose to go get infected by ebola. Send people who are trained & want to do that.,1412899200,,556,4.407766990291262

6453728,5,B00KXQL6IQ,"This was well done and in the same manner of the documentary ""Restrepo."" I would say it has less combat footage, but it is hard to give this less stars than 5, especially when there are crappy war documentaries like ""The Hornet's Nest"" being praised as brilliant instead of as the poor photojournalism they really are. ""Korengal"" rightly focuses on the soldiers and their own views instead of projecting politics into the story, misrepresenting the soldiers, or putting focus on the journalists themselves, as was heavily done in ""The Hornet's Nest."" All that said, the video does not have a lot of combat or patrol activity. You mostly get interviews with soldiers under a lot of stress and a good idea of the conditions these guys endure in Afghanistan. I served in Iraq in two wars while in the U.S. military, and in Afghanistan as a private security contractor, and this documentary is accurate.",1411862400,18,899,4.8441558441558445

6453735,5,B00KXQL6IQ,"Korengal is the second film from Sebastian Junger, who had planned to do this with his close friend, and fellow filmmaker, Tim Hetherington.  The film follows the same platoon in the same valley as in their previous film Restrepo.  Using unused footage during their 2007-09 embed with the 2/503, of the 173rd ABN, Junger turns the focus onto the soldiers themselves and what they think. Korengal is less Kinetic than it's big brother, Restrepo. However, the film offers insight into how the soldiers feel about combat and why, what they think of the people they've been sent to protect and improve their lives, and how they view their impending transition to civilian life. What the viewer takes away is an understanding of how might war stay with a person, long after they've left.
Hopefully, there will be a third film, about where the soldiers are now.",1410912000,10,855,4.8493150684931505

Unless you have a loved one or know someone in Afghanistan you wouldn't even know that there was a war going on since it hasn't changed the way we live. They fought in country for the brother on their right & the brother on their left.  They didn't fight it for the politicians who put them there.
