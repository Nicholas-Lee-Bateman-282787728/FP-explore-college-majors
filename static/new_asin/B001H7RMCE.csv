8308110,5,B001H7RMCE,"This video is the best around, in pertinence to the Chinese Single edge Broadsword. Dr. Yang, gives not only the history of the Chinese Broad -
sword, but a little on the maintence, philosophy and ethics usage of the Chinese Broadsword, as well. The video also covers not only the basics, but two person drills. To expand upon the fundamentals, and take the basic techniques into practical application. What I found unique about this video, Dr. Yang, seems to present the fundamental material, in a 'Concept' form. Allowing the viewer to learn and comprehend the material, a lot more efficiently and expeditiously. However, I do have some comments and grievances with this video. Dr. Yang, failed to present and teach any stances and guard postures, with the Chinese Broadsword! For further Chinese Martial Arts fencing training and knowledge. But other than that, the video is well over three hours worth of information. Worth every penny!",1471651200,,940,5.070967741935484

8308112,5,B001H7RMCE,"Very well detailed.  Of course, personal training is the best, but since that's impossible to find in my town, this will do for a good while.  I would get other weapons DVDs by this master.",1459209600,,189,4.371428571428571
8308113,5,B001H7RMCE,"Dr. Yang is an excellent teacher. He demonstrates the techniques slowly and an easy to understand fashion. The best part is is explanations on the applications of every technique, it really helps when you know the intention behind the movements. Highly recommended for anyone how wishes to learn Chinese broadsword either southern Shaolin or northern it will help improve your technique and your understanding.",1448409600,,410,5.421875
8308114,5,B001H7RMCE,"Very impressed with Dr. Yang ...
I have trained in various styles of combat over 30 years, including kendo ...
As such I found the Saber Fundamentals to be a lot more, flowing, a fluid style, a more dynamic and graceful art, incorporating the use of more angles of attack and defense , it offers more variety in close range ...
It is a refreshing change, providing new stimulus and contemplation for any ... Serious ... martial artist!",1431561600,,435,4.589743589743589
8308115,5,B001H7RMCE,Rather than just another DVD of forms with no real explanation the is DVD give detailed information about saber training and drills to help you develop the basic skills you'll need to make genuine progress with the saber (dao).,1383177600,4,227,4.846153846153846
8308116,5,B001H7RMCE,"I was really impressed with this dvd. All levels will find something in this dvd. those that already train with a dao will find all movements are demonstrated with keywords and applications.basics are never style specific. I have trained for years and know 3 or4 different broadsword forms, never had this much detail. so even experienced practioner will get a lot from this DVD. Anyone new to weapons will also find this dvd helpful, no forms at all, just individual and two man drills, applications, and basics. Easily my favorite dvd, wish had done same with daggers and butterfly sword, ymaa if you're reading..hint. if your on the fence, jump and buy this dvd.",1370908800,9,665,4.842105263157895
