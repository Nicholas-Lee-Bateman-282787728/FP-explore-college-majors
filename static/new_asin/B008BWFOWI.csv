5147211,4,B008BWFOWI,"This is NOT a slasher film, it is a psychological thriller/drama. Lance Ross (Michael A. Newcomer) is a shallow Hollywood horror film director/writer who loves his sister. He has made a film franchise known as ""A Thousand Cuts"" based on an ancient oriental torture technique. As life imitates art, so it was. Oklahoma rube Frank (Michael O'Keefe) had a daughter who was a victim of the technique. He blames Lance and decides to have his revenge.

What I liked about the film was the crisp dialouge during the party. The characters were colorful. Frank, who comes across as a rube, has done his homework as he plans ahead. I expected a twist at the end more complex than what I got, i.e. Frank really being an actor hired by Lance's sister (Olesya Rulin) as that is where it appeared this thing was going and wish they would re-shoot the ending to suit me...but that won't happen.

The film does not contain any real torture scenes. There are glimpses of a torture victim (Madi Goff) from time to time, but nothing for gore fans. This is not a plot/action driven film. Fans of this genre, might try ""Axed.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs (that I recall). No sex or nudity.",1364515200,5,1168,4.605769230769231
5147212,2,B008BWFOWI,"The issue of violent movies inspiring violent crimes is awkwardly handled in A THOUSAND CUTS.
Michael O'Keefe plays Frank who blames a famous horror director for the brutal murder of his daughter, slaughtered in the same manner as in the movie.  The bulk of the film takes place in the director's home where Frank plans revenge.
The movie is very talky and erratically paced.  O'Keefe is disappointing as Frank, giving a rather one-note performance.  Michael A. Newcomer as Lance, the director, is all over the place, at times almost comical with his histrionics.  The movie also has some kind of mystic ending that makes little sense.  A THOUSAND CUTS addresses a controversial topic but fails to either validate or dispute said topic.  Not recommended.",1363824000,,754,5.040322580645161

5147215,3,B008BWFOWI,"This movie is long on conversation, acting and drama. To spice things up a bit, the viewer is lead to belive that there will be some violence, torture, gore and even nudity  happening soon. If you are hoping to see any of those things in this movie, you will be disappointed. This is more of a slow paced psychological drama centered on the morality of making movies nowdays that are ""slasher/torture/porn"" type. It is a good movie with good coversations dealing with this subject, but has little action, yet alot of anticipation.",1358812800,8,530,4.760869565217392
5147216,2,B008BWFOWI,"This psychological drama delivers a serious, sometimes repetitive conversation about the ripple effects of the extreme violence that passes for entertainment.  Is there a moral debt for the creators of dehumanizing on-screen portrayals?  And what happens when that debt comes due?

Playwright Charles Evered (with two other writers) has fashioned a sometimes relevant movie that asks: Is there such a thing as responsibility in art?  Bigger questions swirl around the core drama that riffs on violence in art and entertainment.

Sadly, movie title, poster and home video box art are deceptive and imply the sub-genre of violence porn that the film actually attempts to rail against!  This is a very static and talky film.

Is there actually a negative influence on a healthy person after experiencing violent art, movies or video games?  Is it a healthy release or something else entirely?

Only for these unexpected issues -- and questions -- raised in this micro-budgeted film, do I give it two stars.

It's hard not to be reminded of the superior ""Hard Candy"" when watching this derivative film.  And then there's the wasted talent -- like David Naughton as an extra!

[This movie would make an interesting one act, single set, stage version.  Especially for a high school drama dept.  It might be fun to change the sex of one -- or both -- of the leads.]",1354665600,5,1358,4.951327433628318

There is really no point in reviewing it here.  Nothing about it is thrilling,  and the only horror is the fact it was listed here at all !!!

Watch it if you're interested.  It should get high ratings as a tragedy.",1412294400,,469,4.310344827586207

Simple reason to have watched the whole movie but that's my story and I'm sticking with it. Payoff at the end was good enough to be worth it for me.",1391558400,,430,4.657894736842105
5147225,3,B008BWFOWI,"For Amazon Prime subscribers, I would definitely recommend A Thousand Cuts. If you have to pay for it, think twice, however. It was a fairly original concept--a ""copycat"" killer takes a horror movie concept and applies it to real life. The victim's father--our ""villian"" here--is a great character. This film is meant to make a social statement as well. It is not just another mindless, gory horror flick. Simply put, I enjoyed it. No regrets about watching it.",1389312000,,461,4.923076923076923
5147226,3,B008BWFOWI,"A Thousand Cuts (Charles Evered, 2012)

A Thousand Cuts suffers from what seems to me to be an increasing problem in Hollywood that appeared around the same time we started importing a slew of Asian horror films for the domestic market--that would be around 1998, when Ringu hit it so big. It got to the point where every genre flick that came over from Asia, whether it was on Tartan Asia Extreme, Bloody Disgusting, or any of the dozens of other distributors who have worked tirelessly to bring Asian cinema to our doorsteps (and for that I thank them, even if by this time we're getting a dozen Grotesques for every Booth that comes down the line), was marketed as a horror movie. A lot of them weren't, but when they got marketed as such, people went into them with certain expectations. If you sit down with Rampo Noir expecting to see yet another movie like The Grudge, you are bound to be sorely disappointed, even if Rampo Noir is a dozen times better than The Grudge AND all of its sequels and knockoffs combined. But the movies still rented like hotcakes...so American filmmakers started jumping on the bandwagon. ""Is there any kind of supernatural element to this movie? Hey, we'll call it a horror film!"" The classic American example is William Friedkin's brilliant talk-piece Bug, based on a Tracy Letts play. It flopped so badly in America that no one was willing to release it on DVD for years...and when it finally did come out for the American home video market, the movie was such a smash hit in other countries that it was still playing on the big screen all those years later. Why? Because it got marketed as what it is--an intelligent, cerebral talk-piece that has everything to do with the mental states of its two main characters rather than the sci-fi elements that got so played-up here. Bug isn't a Michael Bay flick, but everyone went looking for one.

And here we have A Thousand Cuts, and everything from the cover art to the title tells you that this movie is torture porn. And so pretty much everyone who saw it, the few of us who did (as I write this, the movie has just over five hundred votes on IMDB, whereas the usual no-budget horror flick available on Netflix Instant can usually clear two thousand in a matter of weeks), went into it expecting yet another Saw ripoff. A Thousand Cuts is anything but--like Bug, it is a slow, cerebral, mostly intelligent thriller that is entirely lacking in the gore department. A true disappointment for those looking for scantily-clad scream queens being taken apart by inventive instruments that could have been designed by Stephen Lack's mad character in Dead Ringers. But for about three-quarters of its length, it is pretty bloody perfect if you happen to be a fan of movies like Bug, or my favorite Asian-mismarketing whipping boy, Su-yeon Lee's 4 Inyong Shiktak, released in America as The Uninvited, one of the best movies I've ever seen and about as bloody far from a horror movie as it's possible to be and still contain a ghost. And A Thousand Cuts holds up to those rather lofty comparisons most of the time--and when it doesn't, the movie doesn't completely blow it; the ending could have been far, far worse than it was.

Plot: Lance (In the Flesh's Michael A. Newcomer) is America's newest it-boy, a big-time director whose latest horror film was an unexpected smash. (Sound familiar? It should; they could have called the first twenty minutes of this movie The Eli Roth Story.) We open at a lavish party in Lance's backyard. He's not the world's nicest guy, but Evered (Adopt a Sailor), who also wrote, is sure to let us know that the guy isn't just a complete jerk; he's probably not a bad guy when he's not entirely stressed out. The party comes to an abrupt halt after the power goes out briefly and comes back on to showcase a photo; we know nothing, yet, but Lance is obviously shaken, and orders everyone out. Soon enough, an electrician named Frank (Frozen River's Michael O'Keefe) shows up to check out the lights...and reveal the mystery behind the photograph. This leads us to the bulk of the movie, which takes place in Lance's living room as Frank confronts Lance, trying to make him justify the violence in his movies.

Does that sound like torture porn to you? Nah, I didn't think so. I mentioned above that Evered drops the ball in the movie's final bits (the last 15-20 minutes of the movie); without being spoilery, I'll say that there is something Frank hints at throughout the entire conversation that would have been better off left offscreen (and to the viewer's imagination). But even so, since Evered HAD to go there, he at least did so in a way that embarrassed neither himself nor the movie. SO while it ends up not being nearly the movie it could have been had it stayed as strong in the final quarter as it was in the opening three, it's still well worth your time, and not at all what you think it's going to be. ***",1374796800,,4933,4.608646188850967
8526686,1,B008BWFOWI,"A psychological thriller where the tension mounts as the characters converse about the morality of violence in entertainment would at least be interesting. This is not that. An attempt was made, and this . . . whatever this is . . . flies very wide of the mark. It has no internal consistency. The characters do not behave like human beings. The acting is not good. The script, from what I can tell, is not good, either. Things happen for the sole purpose of getting to the next thing that happens, whether or not it has any relation to the previous things. A beloved (or not?) sister is believed to be suffocating (""She's in a place where there's not much air."")  but the protagonist (?) and antagonist (?) wade through a long, and at times philosophical (*wanking motion*) conversation with zero urgency. Except sometimes the protagonist remembers he has a sister, and then he screams for a while. Then, back to conversation. The plot twist at the end is hardly a twist, and may not even qualify as a plot. Then, a few more scenes where the now-humbled director is seen to be deeply affected by whatever the heck just happened. Certainly more so than whoever has been watching this movie.

The poor acting was too distracting to really appreciate anything else. I do think the title is misleading. It seems as though it would be a gory horror movie, but it isn't at all. I think I would have preferred to watch the actual ""A Thousand Cuts"" movie that the film revolves around. The ending is just kind of... well, dumb. No, you know what? The whole movie is dumb.
