8183871,5,B000O78L8W,"We used to have Comcast on Demand some months ago, but we had to switch over to AT&T U-Verse. My son, almost 30 months, absolutely loved what we (& he) called his ""baby shows"" When my daughter was his age around 2 1/2 as well (she'll be 4 next month), she fell in love with Brainy Baby (ahem; and First Impressions :), once she turned around 3 though, she started watching Nick Jr. and did not really care about these ""baby shows"" yet my son caught on to them around that time and loves them! He likes to get snuggled in a warm blanket and watch the episodes with me. So, when I searched Amazon for the DVD, I was ecstatic to have came across this DVD learning pack. MY kids, mostly my son, loves it, and I'm positive is learning along the way.",1329782400,,744,4.173611111111111
8183872,5,B000O78L8W,"This product contains 6 DVDs in one case--Brainy Baby ABCs, 123's, Shapes & Colors, Animals, Art, and Music.  I bought this primarily to help my just turned three year old learn his letter sounds; he already knew the alphabet song and could count to 20.  Now he can count to 30 and is finally saying ""twenty"" instead of ""twenty-teen.""  It has also helped with letter recognition--he recognizes all the letters now instead of just half.  He enjoys all six videos though I believe they were meant for an older toddler rather than a preschooler.  My 10 month old watches the videos intermittently as well and I hope they give him a head start; I think they have much more educational value than the Baby Einstein Videos and will be watched longer.",1191110400,16,744,4.648854961832061
