8443209,4,B0031YDDGU,I get an erection everytime I watch it which leads to masturbation but for the most part the models are well sculpted and it gives the viewer a good exercise workout,1511654400,,165,4.354838709677419

8443211,2,B0031YDDGU,"I wasn't expecting a video from the 80's. I guess I should have read the synopsis more thoroughly. Not a horrible workout to follow along with, but beefcake factor that ""makes it interesting"" was almost depressing.",1320883200,3,214,4.972222222222222
8443212,5,B0031YDDGU,"Greenwood/Cooper continues the Da Vinci Body Series with this Volume 3 Cardio Workout, and if ever there was a time of year - after the holiday festivities and increased caloric intake accompanying them - this beginning of the New Year is an appropriate time to insert this DVD into the computer or television and follow the program focused on fitness.  The models provide visual incentive to initiate the attention to health and diet and physical well being.  The exercises demonstrated are well conceived and easy to follow.  Sometimes it takes a visual incentive such as this to get back on track, and the only message here is one of paying attention to improving health - a valid reason to invest in this guide.

8443213,2,B0031YDDGU,"Somewhat disappointing, black & white, a great deal of repetition of the aerobic dance movements, six guys using a lot of energy but having no physical contact whatsoever and no introductory scene in the changing room which might have stimulated one's interest.",1281225600,7,261,5.238095238095238
