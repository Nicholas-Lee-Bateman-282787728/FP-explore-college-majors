3872210,4,B0028AD73W,"My now almost 5 year old has been in love with this Wubbzy special since it came out on TV a year ago and we are still loving it one year later. The story resonates with a child living in 2009, The Wubb girls Shine (Beyonce), Shimmer and Sparkle show up for a talent show a la American Idol, Wubbzy wins and becomes Wub-Z, deals with stardom in his lovable and funny not too perfect Wubbzy way, ultimately transforming back to good old sweet Wubbzy after finding out stardom is not all it seems. On top of that the music and dancing is cheerful and fun.
I would recommend this DVD.",1258502400,,581,4.243243243243243
3872211,5,B0028AD73W,My 5 year old grandaughter loves this DVD....the first one got scratched and I purchased another.  It teaches self assurance and confidence.  It's fun to see her sing and dance to the catchy tunes.,1258416000,3,197,4.764705882352941
3872212,5,B0028AD73W,"If you love Wuzzleburg then Wubb Idol is a no-brainer!  Extra long feature with more content then I think ever made it to the DVR. My niece loves Sparkle, Shimmer and Shine and so will you with Beyonce as Wubbzy's musical co-star.  Her voice along with the upbeat mood and message of ""Wubb Idol"" will have the whole family singing and dancing. Wow wow!",1258243200,,352,4.484375
3872213,4,B0028AD73W,"Wubbzy is great and we love to watch him and his friends.  The movie is very cute also.  My only con on this is that the movie is 90 mins long and that is a bit much when you are used to 15-20 min episodes.  We all needed to watch it in two parts because our attention span is diminshed. I have a boy and he loved it.  I think girls would love it even more, but that's just my opinion.",1256083200,,385,3.7160493827160495
