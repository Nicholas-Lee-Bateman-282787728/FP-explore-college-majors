8588356,2,B00D1QMPYE,"In terms of the show this product is 4 stars. I enjoyed the cast and story. Jun ki and min ah work well together and the supporting cast also helps to keep the show interesting. My problem is with the discs themselves. Disc 1 is almost unwatchable in parts as it freezes periodically or skips scenes as it finds a readable spot. I am using a rather inexpensive Sony DVD player so the problem may be rectified by a more expensive, higher quality player, I'm not sure. I do know that it cannot be read at all by my Xbox 360, one of only two Korean TV series my Xbox does not read, but are read by the Sony player. In terms of the subbing it's good. The sentences and structure are logical and almost devoid of ""engrish"".",1474156800,,718,4.2101449275362315

8588363,5,B00D1QMPYE,"I loved this film.  The acting was wonderful and the film was visually beautiful to watch.  The soundtrack to this film was wonderful and the production values for this ""series"" was quality all the way.  This was my first exposure to these two leads, Min Ah Shin and Jun Gi Lee.  I enjoyed this film so much that I'm now looking for any titles with these two individuals as I'm sure the quality will be great.  Good subtitles but sometimes a little too fast to see.  Packaged well and fast shipping and good quality.",1397779200,8,516,4.4361702127659575
