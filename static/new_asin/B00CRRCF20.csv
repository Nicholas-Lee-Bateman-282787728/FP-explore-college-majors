5735581,5,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderland is one of the best anime's I have ever watched. It doesn't really end, but it is made by Gonzo. While it may not have a real ending, I still really like it.",1346803200,,175,4.0285714285714285
5735582,4,B00CRRCF20,"I'd give the anime thus far a 5/5. The only reason I chose 4 stars was the excessive price. $50 is a bit much--despite it being a ""special edition""--considering this is only the first season of the anime. I would recommend this anime to anyone, but for those who have yet to watch I would say wait for a price drop or another edition in the $30 range. If you have seen it and it has become one of your favorite animes, then by all means buy this version. I have pre-ordered this version because I do find it to be an amazing anime. It is still a work in progress and there are currently 51 chapters in the manga, 21 of which where used in creating these episodes. The author is currently on hiatus due to a pregnancy so it may be awhile before a 2nd season is created but I'd give it a year at most. I thought the dubbing was done very well and the story was well made. Some people complain about the character flaws but that is what makes them realistic and more gritty. If you have the money I do highly recommend but if not, just wait till the holiday season when there will surely be some sort of price drop or a more affordable edition released. If you decide not to buy, I still recommend you find somewhere to watch this anime whether you are a anime fan or not. It is one of the best.",1346371200,15,1292,4.1106719367588935
5735583,5,B00CRRCF20,"The first time I saw this I was instantly hooked. I am very picky on which anime to watch. I mean I was still watching Dragonball Z and Bleach before this. This was the first anime I had any interest of in years.
  I would reccomend Deadman Wonderland to everyone who loves anime. The characters are awesome, the plot is awesome, everything is awesome about it. Sure, the price may be a little high, but this anime is totally worth it.
  We can only hope for a second season of this rawesome anime. Please support it and don't forget to look at the manga to, it gets even better!!!!",1345939200,,582,4.3119266055045875
5735584,5,B00CRRCF20,"This anime is my new favorite animes. Its definitely worth the price, forget all these negative comments about it. It is a must see. I am not going to spoil anything about it. I will defintely be pre ordering it.",1345420800,9,212,4.325
5735585,4,B00CRRCF20,"Contrary to what most reviewers here seem to believe, Deadman Wonderland is a refreshing and interesting modern anime. Ganta Igarashi is a fourteen-year-old student accused of killing his entire class. He is sent to a maximum security penitentiary with a twisted amusement park theme: ""Deadman Wonderland"". While the concept of having the main character being a teenager who is thrown into an adult's world, prison in this case, is somewhat unoriginal there are a lot of fantastical aspects and interesting characters to it that make the series unique. There is a huge mystery surrounding Deadman Wonderland itself as well as the person who is truly responsible for killing Ganta's friends: The Redman. Ganta is what is known as a ""Deadman"" and has the ability to turn his blood into a projectile weapon. However he soon discovers that he is not the only Deadman. There are others with similar abilities to him as well, although what they can do with their ""Branch of Sin"" (The ability to control and move your own blood) varies. In order to survive in this strange new world Ganta as well as the other Deadmen must participate in life-threatening games for everyone's amusement.

I don't want to go too in depth with the plot as I don't want to spoil it for people. The series isn't very long unfortunately; only 12 episodes. However so much happens between the beginning and end of the series that the length of it isn't really taken into account. I'd like to address a complaint I've seen about the series which is the character of Ganta Igarashi. I think this character is similar to that of Shinji Ikari from ""Neon Genesis: Evangelion"" in that he is someone who is fairly young being thrown into a violent adult world. While I can only really sympathize with Shinji to an extent, I find it easier to sympathize with Ganta. Where Shinji does not ever actually try to overcome his apprehensions and instead whines about it in a corner, Ganta actually fights back as much as someone his age possibly can. It's much easier to understand Ganta's angst as his life comes crashing down before he even knows what's going on and he is thrust into a world that is completely unfamiliar to him while his life is simultaneously being threatened. The only negative thing I really have to say about the series as a whole is that the ending is very disappointing. There are a lot of questions left unanswered and not much is wrapped up so it all feels rather inconclusive. All anyone can really hope is that there will be a season 2 in the works not long after this is released as the ending does seem to somewhat hint at the possibility of a continuation.",1345248000,42,2646,4.690322580645161
5735586,5,B00CRRCF20,"Great anime, but the Manga is even better check it out. I would alos like to mention it is a gore anime,and its definetley not everyone's cup of tea.",1345248000,5,149,4.172413793103448
5735587,2,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderl seemed like it had an interesting story. A boy's whole classroom is massacred, he is framed for it, and consequently put on death's row.

I felt it could have in fact had something going for it. The general idea of the show revolving around the demented amusement park prison was disturbingly interesting. After I found out about the Deadmen and their powers, I thought, ""Hey, this could go somewhere. Maybe the main character will overcome great challenges and earn his freedom since he was innocent to begin with."" Sadly, I was naive and mistaken. The plot revolves around Ganta, who is a real pussy, and he has to win fights against other deadmen in order to survive. An interesting concept, except for the fact that well, Ganta is a wimp. I don't really even understand how he beats veteran deadmen and other strong opponents. It really doesn't make much sense. Anyway, the plot only gets worse and worse as the show progresses.

blood and violence, which was probably the only good thing going for the show. However, I would probably much rather watch Hellsing over this.

the characters are awful to me, main character. Little to no character development with other annoying characters as well. I think the only thing done right was the creepy ass Promoter being such a sadistic bastard. The other mention would probably be for Crow. He was a pretty cool character, it's too bad there wasn't much of a role for him in the later episodes.
I felt this was actually fairly bad. I'm surprised I actually finished the whole thing, but I hate doing things halfway. In any case, I wouldn't recommend Deadman Wonderland unless there were nothing else really to watch.",1345161600,6,1681,4.789655172413793
5735588,3,B00CRRCF20,"Plot: (taken from wikipedia)
A massive earthquake ravaged Japan's mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of the city into the ocean. Ten years later, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. As an escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life. This all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class but instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect. Following a quick trial, Ganta is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.

Arriving at the prison, Ganta is fitted with a special collar which monitors his location and life signs. Due to the heinous nature of Ganta's 'crime', he has to live out his imprisonment under Deadman Wonderland's 'Death Sentence'. A lethal poison is constantly injected into his bloodstream through the collar, but it can be neutralized by consuming a peculiar candy-like medicine every three days, which can be acquired through various activities in the prison, i.e. performing for audiences, working backstage, purchasing with cast points, etc. In order to gather Cast Points, the prison's currency, an inmate has to perform in the facility's lethal games and survive. Fortunately for Ganta, he is aided by a mysterious girl named Shiro, who apparently knows Ganta, and is known by other prisoners as well.

While trying to survive as an inmate on death row, Ganta becomes increasingly obsessed with the 'Red Man' and tries to find him so he could clear his name. In a bizarre twist, Ganta begins to develop the ability to manipulate his own blood, to the point of turning it into a weapon. Unbeknownst to him, Ganta has become one of the prison's 'Deadmen', a segregated group of prisoners possessing the Branches of Sin which makes them capable of controlling their blood. After his ability is discovered, Ganta is forced to participate in brutal gladiatorial death matches, known as Carnival Corpse, whose anonymous spectators pay large amounts of money to watch. In his struggle he manages to befriend some of those he fought off in the arena, and with their help, Ganta continues his quest to uncover the identity of the Red Man, why he turned into a Deadman and the dark secrets the prison authorities are hiding.

Pros:
+Interesting plot
+Good animation
+Likable main character

Cons:
-Extremely depressing
 (I love tragedy animes. However, this one is just too sad and cruel for me.)

Nuetral:
=English voice cast
 (I thought some of the characters were really well done. However, I thought many were far from perfect.)

So, in summary, rent before you buy. I know many people who love this anime, but it just wasn't my thing.",1345161600,5,2977,5.036585365853658
5735589,2,B00CRRCF20,"I just finished marathoning Deadman Wonderland it was overall a decent anime that had a few noteworthy moments here and there but honestly its nothing I would buy and add to the collection unless I could find it for a rather cheap price. Now moving on to the English Dub itself I found it to be a rather average dub that never really reached the level of quality that I was hoping to see. Funimation for some reason or another decided to fill the dub with some of the most absurd profanity that I've ever seen in an English Dub granted some of it at first can be amusing but it overstays its welcome very quickly. The English dialogue can range from being somewhat intelligent to trying way to hard to sound hip and modern constantly using internet lingo like ""noob"" or ""uber""(those words are far to moronic). Patrick Seitz's Crow was excellent easily the best character in the show and the most impressive vocal performance from the English Dub. Eric Vale's Tsunenaga Tamaki was fairly solid & Colleen Clinkenbeard's Makina was solid as well. Greg Ayres and Monica Rial were pretty average in there roles but gave respectable performances. I liked Ryan Reynolds II as the Mockingbird and new comer Lee Murphy was very memorable in episode two as Kouzuji. Aaron Dismuke,Leah Clark, Dave Trosko ,R Bruce Elliott and others were pretty solid. A majority of the characters in the cast are underdeveloped making it rather difficult to care what ultimately happens to them and the villains of the series The Undertakers were paper thin and weren't to interesting your typical one dimensional type of villain. I found the ending to be quite lackluster it would of most likely been vastly better if it had another dozen episodes to build its characters and world more but at the moment the chances of a second season aren't on the horizon. Deadman Wonderland is a steady piece of entertainment but its not worth the asking price of fifty dollars that amazon wants for it.",1344988800,6,1964,4.728862973760933

5735607,5,B00CRRCF20,"Otaku John, the super-fan of Anime, LIght Novels and Manga here to write another review about a very interesting series: Deadman Wonderland.  This series feels a lot like Elfen Lied with a young man who's clueless, who shares a dark past with a psychotic super-violent young woman who also alternates between a child-like personality.  Just like Elfen Lied the young man and woman were childhood friends, but hadn't seen each other in years, and the young man forgot all about her, until it's time for her slaughter his classmates in order to bring him back into her life.  I have to admit I liked Elfen Lied a lot better, but that being said, Deadman Wonderland is still a great anime, with a unique spin on it of taking place in a privately-owned correctional facility that's run by a depraved sociopath who turned the prison into an amusement park of violence.  Here, rich patrons pay top-dollar to watch condemned prisoners compete in deadly survival games and obstacle courses, and there's even deeper underground gladiator-like games between special prisoners called ""deadmen"" who have a genetic virus that gives them the ability to control their blood and weaponized it into blades, bullets, whips, and other lethal tools to butcher one another.  The first half is really pretty good, but the last half feels crammed, and drifts off topic.  This had the potential to be one of the greatest animes of all time, but missed the mark slightly.  In any case, I still rate it 5-stars because the overall package is greater than the sum of its parts. Sure it borrows a lot from other sci-fi, such as the prisoner collars from the Running Man, (albeit these ones poison the prisoners instead of blowing their heads off), and there's an underground revolutionary group out to expose these sick broadcast gladiator games (again, taken from the Running Man), but as an Anime Otaku, I still loved it.  Bottom line: Deadman Wonderland is entertaining.  Maybe it shuffled Elfen Lied and the Running Man together like a deck of cards, but hey, it works.  I only wish there would've been another season to expand the story, so that the last half of this series didn't feel so crammed-in.  And for those other reviewers who say this is too gory... I don't agree. Yes, there is blood and violence, but nothing excessive.  Elfen Lied, Hellsing, High School of the Dead, and Berserk are way more bloody and gory, (all of which I think are great series by the way).  Deadman Wonderland feels more like Gantz and Tokyo Ghoul on a level of violence, blood, and gore.  It's there, but not excessive.  (Still, this is definitely NOT for kids! ---- Adults only!)  But if you like mature and violent anime with a bit of a psychological twist, then you should definitely check this out.  And at this low price, how can you go wrong?  Also, the opening credits sequence is pretty good, and the opening song is one of the best ever.  So, as you can see, even with its minor faults here and there, I still give it a 5-Star rating.  I haven't read the Manga version yet, but a friend of mine says it's even better.  Check it out, you won't be sorry.",1507939200,,3124,4.684981684981685
5735608,5,B00CRRCF20,It's a good show with a pretty good plot line. If you don't like violence or gore then this isn't for you.,1507593600,,106,3.8636363636363638

5735611,4,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderland has its ups and downs through out its 12 episodes. Starts off really well, but does a poor job in organizing the series. Some really intersting and important characters aren't introduced until what feels like the ending of the series. The audience in my opinion will feel like it was left out of a more detailed explanation of some of these characters and what became of them. Feels like an incomplete/ unfinished anime. Probably the most disturbing, grotesque anime ive ever seen, at one point i thought it was more sadistic to watch because of all the carnage and gore than it was entertaining. Most of the characters here like to cut them selves so they can bleed, in turn they use their blood as a weapon through this power they have. On some occasions they fire their blood like if it where bullets until they are pale, light headed and about to faint from all the blood they've lost, which made me feel nauseous. The ova is terrible, the main and most interesting characters are Shiro, Ganta and the mockingbird, was hoping to see all three of them in the ova but none of them come out. I think ive said enough negative things about this anime, overall i don't regret watching it, in fact i loved it, but im sure any sane person would say u have to be insane to enjoy watching this... so much blood, torture, carange.",1503360000,,1342,4.526748971193416

5735622,4,B00CRRCF20,"I overall enjoyed the anime. Binge watched it in fact.

Pros:
Includes both English and Japanese Dubs+Subs
Disc art is simple but still nice, easy to tell which is BD and DVD
Inlcudes both DVD and BD as advertised
Small case
Although translation is a bit different, they basically have the same message just reworded between the sub and dub

Cons:
Censorship is in this
Cover isn't reversible like usual disc releases
Although not really that bad, just ""overused"" but once again Monica Rial voices the main female character
The Intro and Ending songs are very nice to listen to (subs included automatically for the Japanese lyrics)

A little more about the censoring (small spoilers)
I find it odd how some things are censored and others are not.
-The intro has censoring
-Eyeball scene is censored (half of the screen is actually just black)
-Hummingbird nude ISN'T censored (wait, what? But Shiro was censored in the intro?)
-The dead children in the classroom is slightly censored like the amputated head (but an eye is almost completely? What again?)

Overall, the censoring isn't too bad, but it still a bit bothersome. Only like 5 censors in the show that I can remember.  I'd still recommend getting this. It's pretty cheap for what I got it at, enjoyable, wouldn't recommend as a family thing to watch though.",1492128000,4,1317,4.835555555555556

Unfortunately they are not making anymore seasons as far as I know so this is it. If you want to understand, you NEED to read the entire manga. The show leaves off around volume 4 of the manga. The first time I watched this when it was on toonami I didn't understand it. But then I read the manga and low and behold, it all makes sense. If you love it as much as I do, read the manga.

5735637,4,B00CRRCF20,"First of all the price of 17.95 makes this series well worth it.  As it says on the back 100% Blood Guts And Gore guaranteed and it lives up. As others have said there is a ""slight"" censorship in some of the gore but is really only about 10% censored when you take in the show as a whole. And for those that like the nudes in the opening and complain about it being censored it's in the blu ray extras. Seeing as how I'm not into that in anime I'm glad they went the route they went for the final opening. The other censorship comes in this weird darkening of the screen or specific points on the screen and as far as censorship goes this is the best way to fool you into thinking it wasn't necessarily censored although without it I would have rated this show a full 5. And to let those who aren't into nudity in anime all the time rest easy if there was any other nudity it was very brief seeing as how I finished the show about a week ago and can't remember anymore. The blood and guts is what I'm here for and deadman wonderland is awesome. As I said there are some ""censorship"" parts but you still see plain as day spikes through flesh, flesh melting off faces, raining blood, etc. I watched the entire season in about three days. Even tho the show is only 13 episodes long I usually watch 1-2 episodes of a show every 3-5 days so to finish an anime in this short of time has to really catch my interest.

I guess I can at least have this small little moving image delight to go along with its source material, although I would be joygasmic if I were to hear about a Deadman Wonderland reboot!

Violent, action-packed, and twisted in plot and story, this is an anime after my own heart!  Just know, if you have not seen Deadman Wonderland before buying this, you will be sad by the end of the DVD, knowing that there just is no more to be seen.

If you enjoyed these episodes, you owe it to yourself to read the manga and give this series the love it deserves.  Who knows what the future holds?

Ganta is wrongfully accused of a crime that he did not commit, the slaughtering of his fellow classmates. Unluckily for him, a new amusement park has just opened to tourists. Deadman Wonderland, a place where criminals are forced to fight to the death, all for the enjoyment of the tourists! Little do the tourists know that it's all real, but they'll still come, stay, & pay for the ""quality entertainment""!

So now to answer your question - why 2 stars.  You are not buying a ""complete series"" with your purchase.  What is included on the disks (3) feels like about half of the story.  As such, I reduced my rating from 4.5 stars to 2.25 stars.

Make no mistake, the story is excellent, and leaves you curious and hungering for more after every episode.  It just abruptly stops at 50% complete.  The sellers have concluded that as they have included the entirety of the filmed pieces in the collection, it represents the ""complete series"".  Well, I am here to tell them that it does not.

The story is good enough that at some point, the series should be completed.  Just hold off to purchase that product.  This thing is half-baked.",1449705600,,959,4.5

5735707,5,B00CRRCF20,"I bought this show just because it sounded like a very interesting concept, I'd have to say I am in no way disappointed. This show is very entertaining and has a vast amount of action. It is not a happy anime so don't go in expecting such.

If you do purchase this I highly suggest watching it with sub, not dub. The main character (Ganta) is voiced by Greg Ayres in the dub and it is (in my opinion) poorly done. He uses an extremely high pitch whiney voice that I could not bare. The sub is fantastic, the voice acting is very well done. The disc will start in the dub so just go and chage it to sub in the settings.

The last topic I'd like to touch upon is that this is as uncensored as the show gets. Some swears are [bleep]ed out both audio and subtitle wise. I honestly would not worry about it though because it does not break immersion when I was watching. The opening title sequence is censored but you can find the uncensored version in the special features.

While the ending is a fairly large cliff hanger that does not take away from the rest of the show. Just in case you were wondering, both the bluray and dvd quality are great. I would definitely suggest checking this show out.",1437523200,,1196,4.2368421052631575
5735708,4,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman wonderland is a very gruesome anime. It dwells and dabbles in the subject of government conspiracy and the dangers that having a special power among others can bring. This anime is very psychotic and a great watch for anyone that likes to see anime on the edge. The english dub isn't the best dub, I'll admit, though I haven't seen the Japanese dub yet, the English dub is only okay. My major flaw with is is maybe that the main character, Gunta, is a junior high student, so his voice is more cracky and can get slightly annoying from time to time. Everybody else's voice acting is relatively decent. The show, being anime and gory can get a little corny from time to time.  There are things you notice that normal people wouldn't say and them putting that dialogue into the show takes away from the show itself a little in my opinion.

now to the rating: WHYYYYYYY the heck is it censored when the slip cover clearly states that it isn't!!

the censorship easily erased a star and a half by its ugly black squares flying on the screen every time someone get's chopped off!! on the cover it literally reads*Death is the main attraction"" it doesn't take a scientist to expect blood gushing out every now and then, so why would you release it censored!!

I took off the other half because of ""ganta"" the protagonist, i'm okay with main characters crying and blaming him/her self for being weak and worthless but when its over done its just AUGH!!

5735722,5,B00CRRCF20,"One of the most violent, gut-wrenching animes, DEADMAN WONDERLAND surpasses the standard anime with its superb action, settings, and plot twists.

For 14 year old student Ganta Igirashi, it's just another normal school day. That is until a mysterious red figure appears outside his classroom window three stories off the ground. In an instant the glass shatters and the classroom is covered in smoke and debris. When he comes to, Ganta sees his entire classroom filled with the corspes of his classmates with the ""Man in Red"" holding the head of one of his best friends while smiling. The trauma of what he sees causes him to faint and when he comes to he is in chains and is blamed for the deaths of his classmates.

With no way of proving his innocence Ganta is sentenced to Deadman Wonderland, the worlds one and only prison/amusement park where inmates contribute to society by inflating the tourist trade. There Ganta meets Shrio, a mysterious albino girl who claims to be Gantas friend but he can't seem to remember her.

As events unfold, Ganta learns a horrifying secret. That Deaman Wonderland's true purpose is housing people with the ability to use their spilt blood as a weapon, and forces them to fight each other in gladiator style arenas. And Ganta has that power too!

Filled with suspense, violence, and twists that will make your head spin, DEADMAN WONDERLAND is an anime that you can't afford to miss if you have the stomach (and blood) for it!",1430956800,,1463,4.770750988142293

If you are a sensitive soul who is empathetic to your fellow man, get your ass out of here and buy some other anime. This is a twisted and dark story called ""how much can we crush their hope?""

In the first five minutes you find out how this is so not an anime for kids. And it all keeps going down hill for the main character.

It has blood and gore and more then a few swear words, but the story is interesting and the dub is one of the best funimation has. It has twists and turns and WTF moments as well as well placed humor to balance the dark tone of the show.

5735734,2,B00CRRCF20,"This really had so much potential, but it fell way too short. I really liked the animation, was beautifully done. Voice actors were really good, and it had a solid story. But the more episodes I watched, the more I wondered how they were going to finish the story up with such a few number of episodes. Short answer: they didn't. This was such a let down, because they could have pulled off an amazing anime easily, but it felt as if it was rushed in the end and the show lost a lot of steam.

Minor spoilers below. Don't read if you don't want to ruin the story for yourself.

It had so many things going on in it's plot that they could have made three separate anime shows off all the concepts. The thing that was kind of annoying about it is they would start with one kind of universe like him being in prison and having to earn points to survive, that in itself could have been the story. But then they turned the corner into G block with underground fighting and never looked back at the actual prison concept. Then they went on to people with special abilities and them wanting to fight oppression and show the world the truth.

The most annoying thing by far was the fact that there were so many unanswered questions and too many loose ends. There was never any explanation of how Ganta and Shiro knew each other from before, never explained what caused the great earthquake or how it infected select people with these blood powers. Didn't go over how the prison came about or its corruption. Weren't told about any of the spectators of the underground fights between the prisoners with abilities. Vaguely went over peoples back stories for a minute or two right before they were about to die. And left people guessing at who the 'red man' really was, maybe Shiro all along or the 'grandpa'? And how did they know each other?

And it very briefly showed the 'Mockingbird' character, which was supposed to be the toughest person in the prison, but showed him at the very end and didn't even go into depth with the character. Why show him at all? Didn't go over Ganta's family at all, just his friends that he lost in the massacre of his class. In the end, it didn't show what happened to the people that survived, only showed Ganta and Shiro sitting on one of the rides at Deadman Wonderland and he says he doesn't even care about leaving the prison anymore. It shows one OVA episode that doesn't even pertain to anything. It's about Senji/Crow before the prison was even open and he is using his abilities as a police officer. That just left more questions!

This show could have been really good, had they actually put the effort forth, this just screams unfinished work and laziness. That may not be the case, but that's the impression it leaves after watching it, and I feel cheated for buying it.",1427241600,,2807,4.4639376218323585

5735757,5,B00CRRCF20,"Ok. So this is my first review of anything ever on amazon. I just felt the need to comment on this series because of just how amazing it is.  (I'm not going into any details about the story line) but I will let you know just how well the writers did with it. I'll let you know a little about the main character (I'm not going to go into any major details, you'll have to watch the series ;D) ok, here I go. Ganta is a 14 year old boy who is framed for murdering his class mates, and is sent to a hell-hole ominously named ""Deadman Wanderland"" this amusement park/prison is where all prisoners are made to ""work"" for their freedom in events... or more commonly referred to (in the show) as the ""Dog games."" When I say the words ""amusement park"" it is not to be taken lightly. People pay to watch men and women being slaughtered in these Dog games (and are avid customers to the show) that being said, people love watching human massacre! (Like I'm any better xD) but before any of you believe that I am hating on the violence and gory details of this series, understand I have watched this series repeatedly and am absolutely entranced by the story line and the gore that most would say is ""dis - tasteful"" well I, lady's and gentlemen, am one sick son of a b***** who loves this series. But seriously. You don't have to like the gore to love the story line. I applaud the writers for such an amazing show of artistic, and we'll thought out storyline. I look forward to the day that they continue the series. It will make me one happy *cough* sorry. (Might I mention that I am a writer as well, and the writers here inspire me to do better with my work as well. Again, I must applaud their skills.

5735760,5,B00CRRCF20,"IS IT UNCENSORED:

I bought the DVD BluRay Combo Pack Edition. As many of us have seen in the american release anime world, companies get lazy to release stuff. So they rush everything as quickly as they can to make money quicker. This release GUARANTEES that it is completely uncensored. I have read many reviews on here that say both true and false statements about if it really is. FOR THE MOST PART, the DVD Bluray Combo Pack IS uncensored. Note that I have only watched the DVDs not the Bluray so I am not sure about those. The blood and gore is included and so is all of the foul language. What is NOT uncensored is the opening. Funimation blacks out Shiro's and Hummingbird's nipples and removes the men's nipples altogether for some reason. I can deduce that this is due to said laziness. There are some things that Funimation simply forgot to uncensore, it seems like. So, THIS is as close as you are going to get to the uncensored version on DVD.

THE SHOW IN ITSELF:

Deadman Wonderland was a cancelled series as the manga was much more popular. Therefore, the ending in the anime is inconclusive. Despite that, this show is great and that been done by the same people who did Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo, which, are amazing series. Regardless that the ending does suck, this is definitely worth the buy. You can google the ending or simple read the manga online or by purchasing the books. Deadman Wonderland is also on netflix, and is uncensored on there as well. So if you are hesitant, go ahead and watch it before you buy.

CONCLUSION:

An excellent purchase and I recommend this series to anyone who loves violent and beautifully goreful anime. It is indeed a classic and I will continue to rewatch this series as it will never get old.",1420156800,2,1757,4.5474683544303796

5735763,3,B00CRRCF20,"This show started out strong for me, but then it just stops. If you aren't into just being left hanging then I might suggest reading the manga instead, or at least before you watch the anime series.

Still it's an interesting show, and something that I seem to get some dark humor laughs out of. I would have liked for there to have been more official deadman battles before the climax. Everything just felt overly rushed, but it plays out that way in the manga as well for the most part. Trying to explain the idea of the show sound like the most emo idea ever. Not that it's bad, but it's people with poison in their blood who cut themselves to hurt others. That's pretty emo edge right there. Either way the action is good, there is some gore, and the english voice cast is well done if you like dubs.",1418774400,,804,4.2894736842105265
5735764,4,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderland is a based on a very good Manga (comic book ), that became a very good and pretty faithful adaptation as an Anime. One slight problem however, while the Manga was finished last year, the Anime was never completed. You can still find the last few chapters of the Manga series available online from ""several"" sources so if you're stuck scratching your head wondering ""what happened next"", following this advice will probably answer most of your questions (not advocating this method just presenting it as an option). If you haven't watched the Anime and/or read to the end of the series you may want to avoid the next section of my review because SPOILERS AHEAD:

Spoiler Synopsis Alert:
Deadman Wonderland at its core is a story about two childhood friends - the main character Ganta and his female protagonist/ love interest/ comic relief - Shiro (the albino girl). When the series begins all of Ganta's school friends are slaughtered by a mysterious ""red man"" who wears a red cape and mask, and has a mysterious power to shoot a red bloodlike substance from ""his"" body that Ganta later finds out is called ""Branch of Sin"". This happens on the day that Ganta and his friends were scheduled to take a trip to the Deadman Wonderland amusement park, that is part amusement park, part penal colony, that was built after a mega-disaster wiped out a large section of Tokyo, Japan. Ganta is the only one that survives this attack by the Red Man and he is framed for killing his classmates and sentenced to death row (despite being a minor which is rough even for Japan). Long story short while in prison Ganta also finds out that he has the power to use ""Branch of Sin"" and is forced to fight other death row inmates (most also falsely imprisoned) for survival while entertaining rich investors watching from around the world. He also meets a mysterious Albino girl that he doesn't recognize at first but slowly remembers as his childhood friend named Shiro, who seems to hilariously be immune to any kind of pain or danger that the prison seems to inflict on Ganta and his other friends. After Shiro bails Ganta out of several jams, he finally remembers that they used to dress up and play a superhero that they watched on tv together, cape and all, with Shiro being the one with the superpowers most of the time. Ganta slowly realizes that he has feelings for Shiro but that she also has a dark side and everything comes to a head when Ganta is faced with the choice of getting revenge against the Red Man, sharing his true feelings for Shiro, and helping to save his new friends at Deadman Wonderland - and whether he can accompish all three....
 END of SPOILERS

The Blu Ray quality of this disk is very good and Funimation did a good job of encoding it. The downside is that the Blu Ray discs are only dubbed in English (which most people probably won't mind) but you also can't watch the Blu Ray with Subtitles which I like to do with alot of Anime even if its dubbed because I think subtitles usually give you a more faithful translation (most of the time). Overall I really like DW and would add it to my top recent Anime Listmania list if it wasn't for that fact that the ""Complete"" series isn't really complete. Hopefully they will maybe release a direct to disk OVA movie that covers the rest of the events in Manga series, because it in my opinion is one of the best series in the last few years.

Important:
I would definitely NOT recommend this anime for young viewers/ young adults who may be younger than 17 -18 or older, just because altough there is no blatant nudity and there is violence (some of it censored), it does deal with some disturbing themes including abuse, murder, sociopathology, sexual assualt to name a few, so despite its description its definitely not ""kids"" anime by any stretch so ""viewer/ parental discretion"" is advised. However like many Japanese Anime it has some redeeming messages and could be interpreted as a reflection on society (well I guess), anyway just a disclaimer, I'll say like the character Shinji would say ""Don't come blaming me later on kid...""

Its not so much that I have to see everything, but its more about the principal! I don't need any government or censoring committee telling me what I can and can't see! I want to enjoy this work of art in its original splendor, and see everything, because I enjoy this anime, and its story! Having parts taken out because I ""can't handle it"" is terrible.

But there are many worse anime out there that are uncensored, and show everything under gods green earth, that beg the question....Why the hell was this one censored to begin with?",1407974400,46,1078,4.517948717948718
5735794,5,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderland is one of those series that gives you your violence fix for sure. Personally, I loved it! Gratuitous blood and violence, plenty of colorful language as well. I wouldn't advise letting kids watch this, but who am I to say :) Anyway, we find our protagonist falsely accused of murdering his entire class and having to go to the Deadman Wonderland, a privatized prison that turns his world completely upside down. He now has to fight other ""Deadmen"", or individuals who have a so called Branch of Sin, or an ability to use their own blood as a weapon, in order to survive. The characters in this series are amazing, some are so twisted it just gives me goosebumps! The artwork is also top notch and the opening and closing score are great. I have heard many of the english dub voices in other animes, so it takes a bit to see the character you are listening to instead of the one you are used to hearing, but I personally can handle that. I do however wish they would have used a different voice actor than the one they chose for the protag (same voice as ""God"" in Angel Beats), but that's ok. Overall, if you enjoy twisted, bloody, gory killings and clever (if not crude) dialog, you will love this! Leaves us hanging for another season though, so be warned! Also, I read reviews stating this was edited, and there are some killings that seem to have a blur around the actual wound, however I think it was just the style in which this was animated. Trust me, there is plenty on action in this one. Support the American anime market and pick this up!",1407801600,,1566,4.440972222222222

5735796,4,B00CRRCF20,"Correcting my previous review/rating for the item as promised.

The show is not so much a ""complete series"" as it was a first season of what was supposed to be a multi-season show. Sadly it did not fare well and got the axe so you're left with a bit of a frustrating and confusing ending, if you want to call it that. I won't knock the product for that because it is as much as Funimation was able to produce, and I think they did as good of a job as Funimation usually does for a barebones box set. No real extras (except some commentary), but I don't pay the 500% markup for post cards, art books, and whatever other doodads Aniplex tries to justify their prices with.

If you like somewhat darker Battle Royale/Elfen Lied/etc. shows and movies, you'll probably dig this series. As I noted in my initial review, my BIGGEST gripe is that the show has a LOT of distracting shadowing on certain scenes which blocks out some of the gore, ostensibly to censor out what was deemed too violent for broadcast television. I'm not entirely sure why they decided to go that route yet kept almost all the rest of the content intact (including plenty of language, and a good bit of violence... which added to the confusion...), but it gets somewhat distracting in places.

One thing that IS nice is the show is fairly faithful to the manga, so barring a few characters and minor plot points you can watch this show and then start right back up in the manga and finish off the story, which I'm now doing.

4/5. Not the greatest show out there, but it was entertaining and well priced, so why not give it a shot? You might just like it enough to read some more of it. For the price it's not too bad of a gamble.",1406937600,,1698,4.330188679245283

All in all, if you want some great visuals, amazing story, cool characters, and great music and voice acting, this is for you.

As Ganta is put on Death Row by the courts he's sent to an amusement park/prison to serve his time.

5735815,3,B00CRRCF20,"I'll skip the preamble and just roll into pros and cons.

***PROS***

CHARACTER DESIGN was great. I've seen a bad-ass with an eye patch one too many times, but this still worked. Right when I think I'd seen each one of these characters a thousand times before, they give me just enough of a variation to convince me that they were original. On seeing the characters alone, I was intrigued. As for their depth, it's good enough for the story and you'll be able to pick favorites.

ANIMATION/ACTION was solid and fluid. There are enough great motions, fluid animation, and unique death scenes to satisfy. As they move into the middle of the series, HERE COME THE FREEZE-FRAMES and lazy directing tricks to skip actual animation (yet not enough to really piss me off).

STORY. Who cares. The promise of story is in the premise that has been laid out. It's a prison where inmates duel to the death and eat (candy) to keep their collars from poisoning them. This is set up to be fan service and kick-ass encounters. If you're going into this attempting to elevate your thoughts (Evangelion), or be emotionally wracked through a gut-wrenching test of character evolution (Berserk/Elfen Lied), then you haven't done your pre-buying homework. This one works very well in terms of pacing and keeping the viewer interested in where it's going (at first . . . please read on).

***CONS***

DECAPITATION SYNDROME is the label I give to shows that lose their concept, stray from the premise and, in an effort to push mediocre to epic, chop their heads off and run around like a chicken, kicking the entire structure of their show until it falls apart. Deadman Wonderland suffers from this. Hark! Beware the coming of the guitar villain. There are so many interesting and superbly designed characters in this show, and then they vanish. The tough bitch G-cup warden seems content being completely removed from the storyline. The ""Man in Red"" master boss evaporates into a memory. He's replaced by a butt-rocker monk with jaded haikus, beads that nullify the heroes' powers, and a bazooka guitar. Despite the wonderful character art thus far, this guy looks like he's been scooped up from a Bleach waste basket.  He then takes center stage across from the pacifist leader (who was also forced on us) and they make it about them. It's not awful, but VERY DISAPPOINTING.

And that's about it. This has some really enjoyable moments. If you're not thrown off by lost potential, then this show might hit the spot. It's better than most, worth a watch (first half), and packed with some respectable fan service.

I really love anime when it works. I'm an animator and writer myself, so I'm also pouring through the stacks looking for gems. I'll be doing a lot more reviews. If you find that these are helpful or our tastes align, follow along.  I'll try not to steer you into s***.",1378598400,,2861,4.75
5735816,1,B00CRRCF20,"I loved this anime, but when it first came out it was like $20-$30 now its sold for over $100. Would somebody mind telling me how does an item go from $30 (before its out may I add) (the pre order price) to over $100. I want the anime as much as the next fan, but you people need to get a grip if you think its worth paying the rent of an apt. building and before anybody says anything yes there are apt. out there for over $100. About the price of this box set. For me to buy this movie I need to think of what's more important to have a home or a movie, well a movie doesn't provide shelter, so looks like I won't pay that much unless I win the lottery or they drop the price to a more reasonable one.

5735821,4,B00CRRCF20,"When I was recommended Deadman Wonderland I was told it was the next best thing to watching Elfen Lied and had a pretty nifty plot and some cool ideas. What I wasn't told was that I would be subjected to another unlikeable protagonist and all the cool ideas seem to get thrown out the window halfway through this twelve episode romp and are replaced by a fairly uninventive, though still entertaining second act.

The reviews for this show are fairly mixed, and I can see where you can love it or you can hate it. First of all let's look at the story. Ganta Igarashi is in middle school, has a bunch of friends, and is the only survivor when his whole classroom in brutally murdered by a person simply known as the Red Man. Ganta is framed for the murders and sent off to a prison called Deadman Wonderland, a privately owned facility that doubles as a kind of amusement park where the prisoners perform for the civilians. This idea is fairly cool and it gets even cooler when we learn that the prisoners also participate in death games such as obstacle courses full of guillotines, electrified water and snipers. There are also fights called the Carnival of Corpses that are one on one battles between the prisoners. This was awesome. Another plus were the Branches of Sin, something never explained in the anime where a prisoners blood can be used as a weapon. Ganta for instance can shoot blood bullets and Senji Kiyomasa can turn his blood into arm blades. The biggest part of the plot was some of the prisoner's ability to manipulate their blood and I found it to be pretty cool.

With that said, yes, this is a bloody and gory anime, though I can't say it's that bad. Elfen Lied is a lot worse in the gore department, though there are some cringe-worthy scenes scattered throughout Deadman Wonderland, especially at the beginning and toward the end. Personally, there was only one moment where I was kind of yucked out, and this involved an eye being ripped out of a head, but otherwise it seemed fairly tame, at least for something that touts itself as bloody and gory.

The series starts off strong and the story is really cool and the use of this carnival as a device for killing prisoners is both smart and entertaining, but after a second Carnival of Corpses fight, the series seems to taper off and it never uses the setting for anything exciting. The second half of the series never includes a portion such as a game or a Carnival of Corpses, it's just this resistance attempting to escape. In a longer series, this may not have bothered me if the next story arc pertained to another obstacle game or something of the like, but in a twelve episode series, it is disappointing. And to add to that disappointment is the fact that the series does not have a conclusion. It ends one story arc, starts up another, but leaves it hanging. While I understand that twelve episode seasons are the norm for anime, I just wish that decent series would wrap up at least a little more soundly, or even forgo following the source material and try for something different. Elfen Lied strayed from the source material and it worked. I think it could have worked here too.

So the plot starts amazing, and flatlines toward the end with the same generic action and boring scenery I can get out of a long running Shonen title.

The animation is good, not great. The middle school kids looked weird. I mean, Ganta isn't that great looking either, but I couldn't get over how freaking scary Mimi looked. Backgrounds are...blah. The scenery during the first act and the games and fights is pretty cool, but the end of the series follows the characters through dull gray areas and bright white areas and boring brown areas. It's all very unappealing.

The sound is pretty good. I really, really liked the opening. Not only was it a bad*** opening that really got you pumped for the anime (and fit the first act's adrenaline pumping action much better than the second act's dullness), the song was done by Japanese band Fade in English and it makes sense! For those who may not know, Japanese songs tend to intermix some English in the lyrics and it typically makes no sense whatsoever with lines like ""Oh my God is Jesus Christ!"" being sung. This song is perfect English and is also pretty catchy. I sat through the opening every episode because of it and the cool sequence. The ending is meh and doesn't seem to fit the grittiness of the show that much. It's like an upbeat pop song or something. Music during the show is fitting.

In the character department we have some flaws. As stated, Ganta Igarashi is not a fun character to watch. At first I liked him and felt sympathetic toward the fact that he was framed for a crime he didn't commit. But later on you grow to just get sick of his constant crying and wimpyiness. Even the other characters get sick of his being a total loser. He constantly screws up and is constantly talking about saving the bad guys and helping them escape and protecting his friends. He's the classic teenage wuss found in anime such as Guilty Crown, and most notably, Neon Genesis Evangelion. How a kid who whines and cries as much as he does survives a prison as hardcore as Deadman Wonderland is a mystery. I guess it's something about friendship. But I don't care because I didn't watch this to learn life lessons. I watched this to see murder.

Shiro is cool. And not because she's almost naked. She's cool because I know nothing about her, the series doesn't explain much about her and who or what she is, and she seems to be pretty smart because she calls Ganta a wuss. She's kind of silly, kind of sweet, but also the only character who seems to have any sort of depth. Now, I could be wrong, but I felt like if the anime did continue she would be the character with the most depth.

Other notables are Minatsuki Takami, a teenage girl who acts all cute and adorable and turns out to be a crazy-freaking killer. I knew she wasn't all flowers and smiles, but holy cow did I not see how totally insane she would turn out to be. I loved her.

Nagi Kengamine is another pretty decent character. He has a bit of backstory and seems real calm under pressure. He was enjoyable to watch and I wish there were more scenes with him. Senji Kiyomasa is another cool character with very little backstory, but he's a total bad***.

Toto Sakagami shows up about two thirds of the way through Deadman, but he never gets much screen time and the time he does get makes me want to see more of him. Who is he, what is he? These things are never explained and apparently left to a second season.

And that's where I shall start my conclusion: There will be no second season. Sales of the DVD and Blu-Ray were horrible in Japan, meaning this is another anime that just leaves off and is going to be the target of terrible fan fictions for years to come in an attempt to conclude it. Actually, the manga does continue the story and I believe I'll be heading over there to see if it's worth my time.

Otherwise, Deadman Wonderland is probably a 9 for the first act. But the second act is a 6. Which really sucks because I wanted to love this anime and be a raging fanboy about it, but I can't because of it's many shortcomings. The plot, Ganta, some of the side characters being dull, the animation being dull and lifeless toward the end: they all detract from the experience.

Enjoyable, though flawed, Deadman Wonderland is a 7/10.",1372636800,,7439,4.492603550295858
5735822,5,B00CRRCF20,"I love this series so much, I  finished it in two days. Great gory anime for gory fans. It's pretty inappropriate for minors I suggest 15 and up.",1371686400,,145,4.178571428571429
5735823,1,B00CRRCF20,"First of all this review is not for the fans, with that aside I'm not sure what everyone here is talking about. We probably didn't watch the same series because anyone who made it to the ending realized that this show had so much going on that failed in its conclusion.

You know that feeling you get when there's suppose to be another 10-12 episodes but they ran out of money and decided to use it for a teaser to the manga (Claymore anime)?  Deadman Wonderland is one of the most bizarre, odd and weakest anime adaptations ever made for TV, from the beginning to its punishing ending this thing barely makes any sense, and is very sad because its premise was promising and intriguing.

Ganta is the main character of the show, a boy who suffers a paranormal event involving the death of his friends and classmates, all killed by a strange man covered in blood with a crimson armor, but instead of killing Ganta, he embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest.  After the massacre Ganta is declared the sole suspect and following a quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.

My first of many complains in this story is the setting, which it's in a not too distant future and in a not believable one.  PLEASE I kindly ask if you are going to make a story, a TV series, anime, movie or write a book, please-PLEASE DON'T give it a date, it's the problem I have with so many movies from the 80's always waiting for THE YEAR 2000, yeah I'm talking about Escape from New York, 1997 my ass, with that aside, I'm going point out obvious

2nd. It seems the future in this thing there won't be human rights activists to put a stop to the cruelty of those brutal games in prison, also courts will have enough power to give an underage suspect the death penalty, oh yes, just a SUSPECT without any physical evidence for killing all those students in that classroom!

3rd. It is established early in the show that in order to survive they must win the ""games"", in that way they will acquire credit points and the precious medicine called ""Candy"" which will give 24 hours more to live, otherwise they will die of poisoning, yeah sounds original, the problem with this logic is that the ""Candy"" was never mention again only up until the last episode.

4th. the prison was built with the appearance of an amusement park (there is your title) and just like in every other prison of the future, is filled with guards, army squadrons, an uncorrupted high technology security system and security director who looks like a muscle man with boobs or like a huge lesbian, I would have believe more in this character if instead of using an ugly woman would have been a huge man, also if the producer was trying to built a weird fan base that are into manly looking women out of this character then I wish him good luck with that fetish.

5th. The first and sadly the only good game is a death race where all the participants must survive the deadly obstacles in order to get the goal, think of it as NINJA WARRIOR only with death and punishment involved.  The other and last game was ""The Birdcage"" which is a caged match, the only difference is that if you lose the prison will take a limb or an organ from the loser, and we had two matches, and that's it for the games.

6th. The highly dangerous prisoners have their personal bar, where all of them can gather, play pool, have some drinks, and make conspiracies against the prison, WTF?! I wonder what ever happened to all those guards and high-tech security system.  BTW those dangerous prisoners are actually very friendly, WTF?!

7th. The Lolita with the huge sword, WHY?!!!, how come a little girl is in prison? Other than just to have fan service for the audience, It is beyond any possible logic to explain, and the reasons of why she is in prison are very weak, I'm sure that in the future there won't be reformatories for children like her, but the fact that she is one the main antagonist of the show makes this anime a huge waste of time.

8th. The connection between Ganta and his loyal friend Shiro was never explained, the only thing I learned was that she was part of an experiment and that's it no reason why she had white hair or wearing that suit or those gloves, why she was walking up and down in that prison, why she was able to turn into that monster and there's no reason why YOU should care because the ending is just punishing leaving the viewers with more questions than answers, but it was coming because the manga is not even over in Japan.

This is not Escape from Alcatraz hell it is not even Jail Breakers (I love that movie), overall Deadman Wonderland is not terrible but it's definitely not good, but all those problems in the show makes this anime a total waste of time, I just hate the fans that apparently show their support for trash like this, anyone remembers the good days in anime like Read or Die, Paranoia Agent, Hellsing or Elfen Lied?  Yeah those were good days.

5735840,4,B00CRRCF20,"I will begin my review by saying that I have watched this series through several times, the first time being on Toonami, and many subsequent times online. I don't have a problem with the series, and those who complain about lack of character development should take into account that this is just the first season. There is more to the story of Deadman Wonderland than is shown in these twelve episodes. With that being said, the problem that I have is with the claim that this box set is uncensored. If you have watched the anime on TV, or online, you have seen exactly what is contained on these DVDs; it seems the only thing uncensored in the box set is the language, and some of that seems gratuitous. The only episode that I have watched so far from this box set is Episode 12: Salvation (The Grateful Dead) which might arguably be the goriest and most apt to be censored episode.

Here is the evidence of apparent censorship that I have found thus far:

The opening is censored; I know because I have seen the uncensored opening. There is no bare-breasted Shiro or Hummingbird in the opening included on this box set. Also, when Genkaku goes on his murderous rampage and begins shooting the prison guards, every bullet wound appears with a large dark dot in front of it. If this is not censoring, and it is supposed to look as though the entry wounds are burnt, it is poorly done, and I am not buying it. I perceived this as censorship online, and it is still present on the DVDs. There are three more scenes later in which images are blurred. The first is the flashback to when Genkaku was a child, and he is being molested; the broken and twisted fingers on his left hand are noticeably blurred. The second is when Mockingbird uses the Invisible Black that he pilfered from Crow and his wrist splits, and the third is the image of Hibana's dismembered foot after she is slain by Mockingbird.

These things don't hamper my enjoyment of the series, but I feel as though the hype about this being uncut and uncensored is a little dishonest. I was looking forward to seeing Deadman Wonderland with no holds barred, but I feel like I just got the exact same stuff that I'd seen online, except in DVD form.",1362873600,90,2208,4.487562189054726

It's reminiscent of ""Requiem for the Phantom"", ""Elfen Lied"", a little like ""Daughters of Mnemosyne"" but mostly ""Ergo Proxy."" No gratuitous nudity or bare breasted battles. It's more down to earth, violent and bloody. Weapons are literally crafted from the wielder's blood. The soundtrack is hard rock, the characters memorable - and tragic. Basically you give a bunch of psychopaths super abilities and have them battle to the death - or close to it.  It really is a fantastic series and I'm sorry it ended so soon. The extras are pretty thin. There's one special where they show off three voice actors. Two of the specials are commercials for the series.

5735847,4,B00CRRCF20,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Note 2: Score reflects the anime and the packaging together.

Oh boy. What can I say about Deadman Wonderland? Well, to start, this show is not for children. Not only is there violence throughout this 12 episode season, but the swearing is constant and some images may be frighting to some children. I figured I'd break this down into two parts: the anime and the packaging. Normally I wouldn't do that, but I have mixed feelings towards what you actually get in this box set.

Anime:

If you still don't know the basic premise of Deadman Wonderland I'll give you a brief rundown of what's going on. The story starts with middle school student Ganta Igarashi in his classroom waiting for class to start. Then, out of nowhere, a mysterious man in a red cape comes and slaughters everyone in the class except for Ganta. Since he was the only survivor, he is seen as the only possible suspect and is sentenced to capital punishment in Deadman Wonderland. To the general public Deadman Wonderland is just an amusement park, but it's also the home to a very dark prison.

Ganta's mission is to find out what's going on and who the ""Red Man"" is. Along the way you meet fellow inmates Yo Takami, Kiyomasa Senji (aka Crow), Minatsu Takami (aka Hummingbird), as well as others including the mysterious Shiro. Overall I loved the story. I tried to keep the more detailed stuff out, but from start to finish Deadman Wonderland is a joy to watch. Not only does the action keep you on the edge of your seat, but there's enough little plot twists thrown in there to keep the story interesting. As if it wasn't interesting enough with the basic premise of the show.

The animation was done beautifully, but there were some parts (mostly in the very first scene) where things got extremely dark and I had to strain my eyes to make out what was going on. Each character has their own distinct look and personality and I found myself falling in love with all of them, even the extremely weird Tsunenaga Tamaki, who is the guy running this messed up prison. Along with the animation you had an amazing cast of voice actors who did a fantastic job at bringing these characters to life. Overall a great series and I can't say I have any huge gripes regarding it. 10/10

Packaging:

The Deadman Wonderland box set spans three separate discs. The box itself is gorgeous. I loved the whole carnival theme on the front and I liked the fact that the box was made out of a thick cardboard. It's something different from your usual anime box set. However I didn't like the artwork on the back of the box. It made Ganta look like he was a lesbian chick who was in love with Shiro. It just looks weird.

On disc one you have episodes 1-7 along with a commentary on episode 6. On disc two you have the remaining episodes 8-12 along with a commentary on episode twelve, an OVA titled ""The Red Knife Wielder"", and some trailers. Then the third, and final, disc contains one more commentary on episode seven along with text-less versions of the intro and outro and the original Japanese promo videos, commercials, and previews that were made for the show.

To be quite honest I think they could have made everything fit on two discs. Not only would it have cut down production cost, but in a world where everyone is ""thinking green"" this is the furthest thing from environmental friendly. They could've technically knocked out one of the DVD cases which would have eliminated the need for a box. What I would have done is put the three commentaries, the OVA, and all the other extra stuff on one disc and had all the episodes on another. Because if you look on the back of the discs you can see all the unused space.

Honestly the bonus material on here is pretty lackluster. I watched two of the three commentaries and they didn't really do anything for me. And while I loved that the OVA gave us an insight into Senji's past I was a little let down by it. It just didn't have that same flare that the main episodes had. Then the commercials and stuff are pretty useless and I pretty much forgot about them after I watched them. 6/10

Overall Score: 8/10 - As you can see the anime itself is amazing and I loved every minute of it, but the extra's were weak and the packaging wasn't very practical. Was it worth the original price tag of $50? Not really. Do I regret making the purchase? Definitely not. I love this series and I'm glad I was able to snag a copy before they went out of stock. With recent news that the original writer finally picked the story back up we should hopefully be getting some new insight into Deadman Wonderland in a year or two.",1358640000,,4675,4.487058823529412

5735854,4,B00CRRCF20,"From the creators of ""Eureka Seven"" comes a violent sci-fi prison anime series known as ""Deadman Wonderland"".  Created by Jinsei Kataoka and illustrated by Kazuma Kondou, ""Deadman Wonderland"" was a manga series published in Shonen Ace back in 2007.

An anime adaptation based on the first 21 chapters was created and released on Japanese television from April through July 2011 and aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block.

The anime production is by manglobe and is directed by Koichi Hatsumi (Aishiteruze Baby"", ""Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor"", ""Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit""), series composition by Yasuyuki Muto (""Basilisk"", ""Afro Samurai"", ""Sengoku Basara - Samurai Kings""), character designs by Masaki Yamada (""Appleseed"", ""Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040, ""Great Dangaioh""), art direction by Michie Watanabe (""Eureka Seven"", ""Haibane Renmei"", ""Wolf's Rain"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"") and music by NARASAKI (""Penguin Drum"", ""Dragon Crisis!"", ""Aquarian Age the Movie"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Deadman Wonderland"" is presented in 16:9 widescreen with audio presented in Japanese and English 2.0.  The character designs and animation are very cool and chaotic at times!  As one should expect from a violent anime series, there is a lot of blood featured in ""Deadman Wonderland"".  Not because many people are killed, but also because the Deadmen's ""Branch of Sin"" powers is about utilizing one's blood to create weapons.  So, a character like Senji can create a large sword using his blood.  Or Minatsuki who uses her hair to turn into blades and impale enemies or grab hold of them.

But when it comes to animation, Manglobe did a wonderful job balancing out animation with CG.  I am a bit surprised that this series was not anime series released on Blu-ray, since it was released on Blu-ray and DVD in  Japan.

As for audio, audio for the series is primarily Japanese and English 2.0 stereo.  But as the Japanese soundtrack is well-done especially during the more emotional scenes, the English dub actually makes things much more intriguing because as one would expect in a prison, these people talk with a lot of profanity.  In fact, this is probably the most profane when it comes to dialogue that you will hear on a FUNimation animated series, also with the audio commentary as the English dub voice talent go crazy with the F-bombs and C-word.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Deadman Wonderland"" comes with the following special features:

  Episode 6 Audio Commentary - Featuring Audio commentary with Leah Clark and Aaron Dismuke.  (Note: Because this anime series is rated mature, the audio commentary features profanity)

JUDGMENT CALL:

From the creators of ""Eureka Seven"" comes a new, violent and bloody anime series titled ""Deadman Wonderland""!

But while the anime series may prove to be too violent for some viewers, the concept is quite interesting.  Because Japan is in dire need to rebuild after a devastating earthquake, one of the popular areas of entertainment is the ""Deadman Wonderland"" theme park facility.

While the place attracts many people and makes quite a bit of money, not many people realize that inside the theme park is where gladiator battles between Deadmen take place.  And of course, the scientists of the facility are experimenting on the prisoners for the sake of monetary and political gain (of course, in the effort to help rebuild Japan).

What is interesting about the series is that the prison is home to vicious criminals, but somehow, Ganta Igarashi, a middle school student is targeted and framed for murdering his classmates and then being injected with the Deadman power, which is utilizing one's blood to become a weapon of destruction.

And so, this meek boy must be put in a prison full of dangerous criminals.  Ganta is your banal weak character who gets stronger as he learns to become brave and wants to protect the people that he cares about.

Then you have Shiro, a mysterious albino girl who loves being around Ganta.  We know that she is gifted with amazing power but at the same time, she is naive and is always cheerful, wanting to play or eat pudding.

But the series features really interesting characters.  Some who are jerks and badasses, and some who are are just really wicked looking.  And for the most part, by the second half of season one, these characters start to become an integral part of this series.

The 12-episode TV series plays out like a prison-escape film, but each time Ganta encounters people who also want to escape from prison, there is always an antagonist who are Deadmen with amazing power and happen to be quite sadistic.  Also, included is an OVA, but instead of featuring Ganta and Shiro, it focuses on Deadman Senji, who becomes a police officer two years after the Red Hole incident.

While the series is violent and bloody, the English dub takes the series dialogue and enhances it was mature language, to make it more raw and real and what you would expect from a major prison holding the worst criminals.

The dialogue that you hear, coming out of the mouths of the characters is really surprising because it's really profane.  Shocking even the voice talent who were beaming about playing these roles, because they had the opportunity to really say some crazy, dirty and profane dialogue.

The only caveat with the series is that it ends in hopes that a second season would perhaps continue the storyline and end it with a similar ending to the manga series.  There are a lot of questions that were not answered in the first season and unfortunately, the second audio commentary does spoil things by providing the answer of who exactly was responsible for murdering all the students and Ganta being framed for it.  So, if you don't want to know, it's best not to listen to the second audio commentary.

As for the animation, expected to see a lot of red blood splashing everywhere.  Not because of people getting murdered or maimed, but it's because the Deadman's power is the ability to use their blood to form weapons.  It's not that scary, there are people getting slaughtered but it's not too gory.  But the animation from Manglobe was wonderful and it's a shame that the series was not released on Blu-ray, as it was released on BD and DVD in Japan.

As for special features, there are two naughty audio commentaries and as a FUNimation first, a video commentary which I hope becomes common in all upcoming Blu-ray and DVD releases from FUNimation!  But you also get promo videos, commercials and textless opening and closing songs.

While ""Deadman Wonderland"" has similarities to films such as ""Battle Royale"" and maybe even a little ""Hunger Games"" mixed in with anime series such as ""Guyver"", the violence is not too bad and the story is actually quite fascinating and action-packed.  Also, I have to give FUNimation a thumbs up.  Although I'm not too big on profane anime series, the dialogue for ""Deadman Wonderland"" fit.  It's a prison setting filled with vicious criminals, so why not make the dialogue fit the setting.  And the writers at FUNimation did just that!

For anime fans wanting a more mature and violent, bloody anime series, you'll definitely want to give ""Deadman Wonderland"" a chance!",1354320000,,7880,5.014637904468413

Deadman Wonderland is one of the bloodiest animes out there, the beginning of the first episode proves that. But like I said, underneath the bloodshed and horror lies a very thoughtful story. You should probably be around 18/19 to watch it though, it's very intense. It gives you an adrenaline rush, so I suggest something calm to watch afterwards before you go to bed (like Casshern Sins).

5735859,4,B00CRRCF20,"This was a pretty good show in my eyes. I caught this on Crunchyroll via Roku. It was subtitled only,none the less it kept my attention for all 12 episodes.

  Slight Spoiler.....just the first couple episodes/premises.

A normal school kid vegitating as he looks out the window. Suddenly he notices someone or something hovering outside the school window. Then the windows explode, he is thrown and when he looks around all of his classmates have been brutally murdered. Then the murderer comes towards him and implants a mysterious red crystal like object in his chest....lights out. He awakes to find himself handcuffed to a gurney..he is accused of killing all his classmates and sent to ""Deadmans Wonderland"" a privately owned prison where things are not what they seemed. He finds out that the crystal in his chest has infected him and given him the power to control his blood...and use it as a weapon.

Nobody believes that he is innocent and he must prove it on his own. In prison he learns of others like him and that the mysterious killer (aka The Red Man) is also there. Yet before he can confront this other killer he is thrown into a ring and forced to fight others like him.

There is a lot more to the series than just what little I have told you but you get the idea. There are numerous characters you meet along the way and it really never gets boring. There is blood and language however there was no nudity in the version I saw...they drop the f-bomb several times and many other words. At the time I wrote this I had not seen the English dub...well I have seen the English dub and the language is just as brutal if not more than the Japanese dialogue.

 This is a straight forward show and does not have comedy or any fan service which keeps with the prison setting.

I would rate this 4 and half stars. Some of the other things I like are Black Blood Brothers..Elfen Lied..Jui oh Sei. If you like any of those then you should like this. Definitely watch it on line.",1352073600,,1986,4.479224376731302

Sure, there was a lot of violence, but that didn't really get real until episode 6 or so. Character development was weak. The creators tried to put in bunch of plot twists or tried to cram too much into 12 episodes, but the result was a hurried, sloppy story with little resolution or explanation.
If you're down with 12 episodes of a kid crying about how he can never do anything and his strange crush/brother-sister relationship with a mentally handicapped girl, then you might justify the $40-60 pricetag. Personally, I don't think it was worth it, and won't pay full price for subsequent seasons, should there be any.",1351814400,8,726,4.724409448818897

5735863,5,B00CRRCF20,"Others have summed up the premise and some spoilers (I intend to do the same, since it's vital to those who have NEVER HEARD OF DWL), so I figure I'll lay some things out, from seeing this series, beginning to end, in one sitting.

I DO love this series, and if I had the power, I'd find a way to fund a second season (if the reason WAS ONLY poor ratings in Japan, and not the more vital addition of one of the creators being on maternity leave... which I am ok with). But since I can't and the latter reason is a acceptable reason to be on hiatus, I can only HOPE that US ratings will help this become a reality, much like how we got a 2nd Season of Big O (poor ratings in Japan, GREAT ratings in the US).

But now to the meat: This series takes you on so many twists and turns (positive and negative, for the characters, anyways), all being a bloodsport (Deadman Wonderland) wrapped in a bright colorful bow (the fact that the actual place is a carnival-themed entertainment for the masses... while the prisoners.... well... suffer), that you can't help BUT keep watching. Our 14-year-old protagonist (Ganta) is wrongfully accused of a mass-murder in his own school, as being the sole survivor of said mass-murder by a man covered in red... clothing, if you will (more like restraints). The boy is then imprisoned in Deadman Wonderland, where you not only have to compete in twisted games and sports to survive, but also to earn ""candy"", since the collar around his neck and all the prisoners' necks pump poison if they don't get their fix within 3 days.

At first, it would seem almost a modern-ish Now and Then, Here and There (which I hated), IF it wasn't for the fact that some of these prisoners (in a separate block from the other scum) are contaminated with a strange virus that allows them to use their blood like weapons, protagonist included (but he realizes this a few episodes in, not off of the bat), all while meeting a same-aged strange albino girl that acts more like a young child (named Shiro); and meeting with and dealing with a rich cast of characters and supporting characters, from a ballsy and hot female prison guard (Makina) who lets her sword do the talking as she strongly enforces order in this madhouse, to a spiky-haired badass (Senji, aka ""Crow"") who can create blades out of his own blood, who earns Ganta's respect after the poor boy beats him... all at the expense of losing an eye after he loses, to a deceivingly-sweet girl (Minatsuki, aka ""Hummingbird"") with a thing for flowers who eventually shows she's actually anything BUT sweet (in more ways than one, and that's stating it LIGHTLY), to the man-childish ""warden""/""lawyer"" (Tamaki) who got Ganta stuck in DWL in the first place, to a band of rebels who simply wish to escape, divulge Deadman Wonderland's hideous darkside, and to try and live normal lives again. And that's only about two-thirds if not slightly less of the main cast I mentioned here.

How will our poor victim of a crooked judicial system get out, let alone survive a twisted carney-themed jail?  Will this twisted societal experiment called Deadman Wonderland be seen for the snuff-show it truly is. And who is this albino girl who says she knows Ganta, while he has no memory of her at all?

This DVD series is rated TV MA, and is Uncut. Yes, it has a lot of violence (normal and fantasy), blood (normal, and used as weapons), language (a fair amount of it, but Minatsuki's the WORST), semi-partial nudity (bout.... maybe 5 times in the entire show, give or take?) and a good deal of adult situations (some funny, most NOT!)... but despite the mature rating, you may surprisingly get into this anime more easily than you think (if you have a strong enough stomach; this is NOT an anime for softees or the easily-offended).

Ok, now onto the other stuff... I was somewhat disappointed at the commentary, since it seemed the cast was MORE than happy to talk more about other things than the show (C'mon Funimation, be professional: I wanna hear cast's thoughts on the show and their takes on it, than about their ""personal"" lives). I felt the use of dark made it difficult to make out in some scenes what was going on; I'm not sure if that was intentional, or if the video didn't show up well when it was put on the DVD (that's not Funimation's fault... if it was the former).

I like this series, but I feel like I don't want to shell out money for books, especially, if a 2nd season DOES get done (one can hope, considering this economy, and how interested the original company who made this anime is interested if demand here isn't high enough), how much or how little it'll deviate from the books (I mean, look at the first incarnation of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime. How much THAT deviated from the books).

Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 (but I'm giving it a 5 since the show has gotten me THAT fascinated)",1350518400,2,4875,4.549600912200684

5735865,5,B00CRRCF20,"before Toonami came back I hadn't watched anime in years. Since Toonami's return, however, I saw this show and instantly loved it and remembered why i enjoyed anime so much as a child. Deadman Wonderland is very different from the animes i watched as a child and are also the reason why the show isn't for every one. It's very gory and it uses profanity quite excessively (on tv at one point it was just ridiculous with all the censoring because you couldn't understand what was being said), so if you can't stand blood violence and swearing, you'll probably won't be a fan. The biggest downside to Deadman wonderland is how short it is though, it is only 12 episodes and one OVA and whether more of it will ever be made I cannot say (I hope they do though). The ending of the show does leave something to be desired as there is more to the story. If you want more of DMWL I would recommend reading the manga which is still ongoing, but you should know that the writer is on a break and i don't know when the next chapter will be released. It'd be nice if the sales of the DVD resulted in the making of a season 2, but we'll see what happens.",1349740800,,1142,4.243119266055046

It's got mutilations, fights to the death, people who control their blood as weapons, all of this occurs in a prison, and if you don't follow the rules a woman with size G breasts will cut you in half with her sword! But for those who know this & wonder why no season 2 yet it's cause the creator/writer is taking time off due to having been pregnant, but from what I understand the plan is for a season 2. Now if it happens after this delay will probably depend upon viewership while it was on toonami & dvd/blu-ray sales.

5735868,5,B00CRRCF20,"Deadman Wonderland is a very, very unique and entertaining story that I'd really hate to see end so prematurely. However, I'm not sure if anybody else that loves this show realizes, but a premature end seems very likely at the moment.

I may be preaching the the choir when I say this, but it should be common knowledge that it's VERY important right now to buy the animes and mangas that you love, because in this age of anime anything goes. Many great shows and mangas have been cancelled already. (Or on a never ending hiatus.) Many publishers are either cutting back or have sunk from this last global recession.

I'd really hate to see this particular show go. Profits are at an all time low with piracy at an all time high. It doesn't help viewers aren't even watching these shows on cable, either. But anyways, I'm getting off topic. This is a message to all those that loved this show, SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AND KEEP IT GOING!

Anyways on to the review...

This show, along with Black Lagoon and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom (Minus the last scene of the entire series) are three of my favorite post childhood anime. They all are so different in every other aspect, but their original idea for the protagonist remains the same. Now this review, though a review for Deadman Wonderland, also dives into what I look for anime in general. Which means that I'll say something I look for in anime, and how this show has it. It's an unorthadox review style but it's simply how I review. Anyways onto the review.

All three shows use an idea for the primary character that I happen to like WAYY more than what most anime these days use. These three shows feature a NORMAL protagonist that fate has chewed, spit out, and left for the crows. (Which we see happen.) Yet against all odds rise above and beyond the occasion. The three protagonists of these series all start out as NORMAL (Please take note of the word normal.) persons before getting kidnapped, brainwashed, or set up. (Or perhaps a combination of them.) In this particular series, the third is the primary one. We have this NORMAL school kid who is set up and sent to a top security prison for the worst maniacs and criminals society has to offer. This prison is where this story takes place. But this isn't any normal prison; this is Deadman's Wonderland. Deadman's Wonderland is a sick place where criminals become the world's entertainers. They participate and run a carnival like amusement park where they literally have to ""work off"" their sentence...

Sorry for skimping out on the description so soon, I just realized I may saying a bit too much and thus forced myself to stop. A huge satisfaction I had while watching this show was learning Deadman Wonderland's dark secretes and gruesome details and how the characters reacted and adapted to it. Trust me when I say this though, it's certainly one hell of a ride. (No pun intended) Scratch that, in all seriousness this has one of the most unique and interesting settings I've ever seen in a show.  I'll say this again later but I highly recommend this show and I hope you at least try the first episode out online.

 Anyways, the three protagonist of the three series I mentioned aren't luckily born with secret abilities or powers. They aren't the ""chosen ones"" or some B.S. like that. They don't start out a part of some ""secret society"" or are some ultimate bad*** [ex?]military person. No. They are people that could be you or me. In otherwords, they are extremely relatable yet aren't one dimensional. They all question their own motivations, and they all have down-to-earth faults. To me, when shows DON'T do this; all of that equates to is simply the creators skimping out of their viewers/readers. True, some stories did overcome this initial pitfall to become great, (Featuring a one dimensional and unrelatable character yet remedying this pitfall later on using flashbacks or character development DURING the story *Cough* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood *Cough*.) but it's still a huge red mark in my book.

What happens to these characters that causes them to develop and change is very plausible to me. That doesn't just go for the protagonists of these shows either, and that's what I love about them. Nearly every single character in all three of these shows are like this. They aren't the way they are simply for the sake of being the way they are. (True, sometimes it is presumptuous such as, for example, when extra evil character commits evil act. It can be assumed he's done this due to the fact he is, I don't know, IN A PRISON?!)

However, understanding the meaning and reasoning for why characters perform certain actions isn't all there is to making me actually enjoying the characters. Heck no, I enjoyed the hell out of Dragonball Z and that goes against everything I just said if we really sat down and think about it. Its just that in this particular show, the characters themselves and their interactions, combined with their reasoning, is what makes the show for me. Their motivations are very emotional, RELATABLE, strong, interesting, and cool. I don't want to give away too much; so I'm going to say that I simply hope they figure out a way to continue this show. [Which is tragically short handed at the moment in that it's obvious that the animators/creators made this season expecting to make another season at least.] The characters are really just that good in my opinion. Again, I'm not going to spoil anything. However let's just say that nearly all the most awesome enemies become allies yet still remain awesome. (AmIdointhisright?) As a plus, none of them become allies for the usual bull**** that one usually expects. They become allies in different ways and/or for different reasons. (I can't elaborate anymore without spoiling anything. Read on for two examples to pique your interest. I'll try to keep it as watered down as I can. *Minor spoiler* At the start of the series one character starts out as a double agent who ends up actually becoming a legitimate ally [for his/her own reasons]. Want another? GO WATCH THE SHOW! [SeewhatIdidthere?])

As if to be the icing on the cake, the animation, art style, palette is all very good. The whole concept for the ""super powers"" that are present in this show are very well thought out. (It's still reasonable.) and it makes for some interesting (and gory!) action scenes. Again, it's all very well thought out and nothing is over-the-top. Oh yea, you are probably wondering what the heck I'm talking about. However this falls under the ""secret"" information that I refuse to disclose in this review. Understanding how the powers work in this show before you actually watch with remove the actual shock you'll recieve when you are first exposed to it. (Which then has a compounding effect. Trust me as an avid reader of fiction I've tested this.)

Don't worry though, after the first, eh, six minutes. You'll get a brief idea of what I didn't want to spoil in any way/shape/form. This brings me to my next point.

WOW...What a beginning man. Holy ****. Remember how I said earlier that you should watch the first episode? I'll half that. If you aren't hooked in the first twelve minutes of the show than I'd be very surprised because I, personally, was speachless. It didn't even feel forced or rushed, either. Which is very surprising considering how much material the viewers are exposed to.

My only complaint is that it tends to slow down and become somewhat predictable roughly two thirds of the way through. After the initial shock of everything, we are than presented with the cliche, ""WHAT DO WE DO NOW!?!?"" scenario. I mean, it's not like we don't know what a wrongly convicted person does once sent to prison that the very people whom set him up reside...right? Especially when that character is a kid, because what do emotional KIDS tend to do? Eh, I'll leave THAT up to your imagination. Don't let that dissuade you though, nothing is over excessive. I'd label it more ""fitting the part"" than anything over dramatic. In fact, it wasn't until it was over that I realized that the cliche scenes where, in fact, cliche. (Would this be an example Inception?) Also, it was awesome to see the side characters through all of this because they remain faithful to their respective roles throughout the entire show.

Hmm...Did I miss anything? There are a few minor things. I didn't watch this show in subbed, but the dub was pretty good. It was slightly hard to grasp the actual age of a certain character because the character's voice and dialogue didn't quite match what the character looked like. There where some creepy parts, but this stuff is definitely bearable to watch compared to many other shows currently out there. Fanservice is, though misleading at first, quite minimal in my opinion. However I never really thought fanservice as bad, when used appropriately, as people make it out to be though. I feel some people overreact to it a bit too much. Moving on, there are a couple plot holes, but most could be reasoned that they'd be filled with the second season. (Which once again, tragically may not come.)

So my conclusion? TRY the first episode online. Then BUY THIS SET! This try/buy method lets you buy the boxed set and than proceed to continue legally watching the show. (A win/win) This show is a 4.5/5 stars and packs a punch for how short it is. Don't be afraid to take the leap! Deadman's Wonderland is, to put it bluntly, freakin' awesome and this series deserves to be a part of your collection.",1348358400,45,9540,4.7373493975903616
