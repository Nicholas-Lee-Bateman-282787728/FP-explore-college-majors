This set of DVD's does not disappoint; from day 1 I am challenged to try and keep up, and will find myself working with these lessons for literally years to come.",1365120000,4,268,4.469387755102041

Per chi ha occhi e orecchie c' da studiare per anni.

I found this work very challenging,

For those who have eyes and ears is to be studied for years",1323043200,7,761,4.846153846153846
4077770,3,B0036K9C6O,"I have this product and I really didn't get much from it. There IS much better instructional material out there. Like the reviewer sunni said, this isn't a criticism of John the artist but of a product. His enormous talent as a player does not guarantee he'll be a good teacher; and even if he were a good teacher, that doesn't guarantee he and Abstract Logix will produce a good product. This product falls short. And no, he doesn't give you the secrets to how he plays those blazing lines.
Also, the cost of this product is through the roof. So all in all, I wouldn't recommend it given those facts- that it does not provide good instruction and the cost is exorbitant.",1318204800,6,671,4.463414634146342
4077771,5,B0036K9C6O,"This Is The Way I Do It is not an instructional set for the faint of heart. To take advantage of the lessons presented here requires at least a high-intermediate level of skill as well as a good amount of patience and dedication. It is most definitely not aimed at beginners, but is rather one of the very few instructional DVDs that can offer a wealth of information to even the most advanced players. Some may be put off by the relatively high price of the set but the amount and quality of information (which will take most players years to fully take advantage of) makes it well worth it to those who are serious about taking their playing to the next level.",1279238400,18,662,4.390243902439025
4077772,5,B0036K9C6O,"I just had to respond to the 2 star review. First before even getting into this you had better know how to play through all the scales and modes fluently. This isn't a dvd to teach you that and Mclaughlin states that right up front. Secondly, he does only go through the modes in C but shows a number of variations on how to practice them so you can become fluent. If you need someone to transcribe all 8 modal exercises into each mode of each key for you then go buy something else then come back to this. Third, this also applies to the pentatonic scales which are integral to his playing style. Finally it helps to be able to read music or else a lot of this will escape you.

So what do you get? We you get an indepth explanation and demonstration of increasingly complex improvisations based on what he has just exposed. So you can see the practical application and how it comes out during improvisation. And that is his main point. These are only techniques on how to approach improvisation. His overall message is not that these are improvisations you should practice and memorize but this is one approach on how to find your own voice. For anyone even remotely involved in improvisation this insight is extremely valuable.

So, will you have to apply yourself and transcribe the modal exercises into other keys? If you want to get better yeah you should. I just feel the other reviewer felt that 3 dvds should show everything about playing. Anyone who thinks 3 books or 3 dvds will make them a player is fooling themselves. This set will help you along the way to improving your improvisation tremendously. If that's what you're interested in then I highly recommend it.",1277596800,38,1678,4.552980132450331
4077773,2,B0036K9C6O,"I realize this hasn't been released on Amazon yet, but this product has been available elsewhere for a number of years now. I bought it from Abstrax Logic. I was very excited about this product after reading a review at allaboutjazz.com, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. Defenders of the product make the argument that ""you have to work at it."" Well they've got that right. The explanations are cryptic and vague at best and will do little to do benefit your playing and knowledge. It is, however, the hours you will spend researching other products and methods, in an effort to help you understand what has been shown to you on the McLaughlin dvds, that will benefit you.

For example the modes. He simply plays through the modes in one position starting on a different note each time for the appropriate mode. While this is of course accurate, there are far better ways to learn the modes and how to apply them. Your hours of exhaustive research will reveal these to you. The example/analysis section is particularly poor as well. JM plays over a chord pattern then does an ""analysis"" on a large white screen using Logic (still under Emagic when this was done). He points at the screen using a laser pointer and says things like, ""here's E mixolydian"" or ""this is a chromatic run"".... hardly an analysis.

Video quality is ok. Very much a home project feel to it. Not sure if the tabs/music will be included in this set but on previous versions you had to get it from the website unless you want to try and read the musical transcriptions on the screen as they scroll past.

I have Ted Greene's books so I know what it's like to have to work at understanding some of this stuff, but this was just not well executed. For what I paid for this I'm disappointed. You can get something out of this dvd, but there are far better instructional products out there, and the money would be better spent on those or on lessons. I've taken lessons and have dvds and printed instructional materials and this is sadly at the bottom of the pile.",1267747200,12,2039,4.550408719346049
8390037,5,B0036K9C6O,"I love this video....firstly its definitely not for beginners...its for guitarists who already are at imtermediate to advanced level..and already know basic music theory and all modes of maj scale ,melodic min and harmonic minor...the whole purpose of this video is for u to see how john puts all these ingredients together ...and when he is teaching he just touches on these subjects and doesn't really explain anything..he teaches as though u already know a fair bit...this video woke me up that I was wasting a lot of my time in how I was practicing scales ..I was just playing then from bottom to top and down again..john encourages playing them in intervals in this video...if u ever wanted to see what john is like in person or how he thinks when improvising this is for u...",1507507200,,781,4.708029197080292
8390038,5,B0036K9C6O,"John McLaughlin has created a must-have guitar method with ""This is the Way I Do it.""  Good, sound guitar instruction, especially for jazz is very hard to come by.  Larry Coryell, when asked about learning jazz said something to the effect of ""get a good teacher - you have to be careful because there are a lot of bamboozlers out there!""  I would have to agree with that.  I've studied with around a half dozen teachers over my 35 years or so of playing and a few of them were just plain bad, despite having relatively good reputations in the area.  John McLaughlin excels at teaching guitar.  He actually gave Jimmy Page lessons in England when he worked at a guitar store.  'Nuff said...

First off, this course is not for beginners.  John claims you need to be able to read standard notation before delving into the class.  It's also not for people who don't want to put in the time and effort to study.  It's also not for people who want to learn to play fast, like John is often prone to do. Nope, this course is all about the developing solid fundamentals on the guitar with regards to improvisation.

My father was an orchestral clarinetist.  The lessons in this tape are along those lines.  John starts with the modes, but instead of just playing them he plays them against a drone so you can really feel the atmosphere of each one.  He has drills that run scales/modes in 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths and 7ths - both up and down the entire neck.  There are also drills in fluency.  You will be able to develop fretboard and theoretical mastery and play what YOU feel.  It's not about trying to become a McLaughlin clone.

At times watching the musical examples (he does an ""easy"" and ""advanced"" demo of each major concept) is kind of like watching a Michael Phelps DVD if you were learning how to improve your strokes.  But John is friendly and humble and explains what he is doing in a simple way.  He shows you exactly how the drills are incorporated in a musical fashion.

I could go on and I realize that not everyone is a big McLaughlin fan.  Frankly I feel a lot of his playing goes over the heads of most people.  But even if your favorites are Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian or Barney Kessel, you can't argue with the fundamentals presented here.  And if you like Pat Metheny and/or George Benson (more contemporary players) you'll love this set.  John really digs deep into modal playing including comping for vamps similar to Coltrane's ""Impressions"" and some Miles stuff.

If you think you're going to watch this a few times and put in a few hours of practice and start playing like John, move on.  But if you are looking for a lifetime of ideas and things to work on and inspire you, pick up this set and really work with it.  You won't regret it!  I am loving it.",1488585600,,2783,4.453465346534654

8390043,5,B0036K9C6O,"This is John McLaughlin up close. This set of dvds was well worth waiting for. I had to wait a bit for the price to come down,but worth the wait! McLaughlin is a true world class guitarist,and these dvds show (in my opinion)just the surface of what he can do. Is this a dvd for beginners?Good question. McLaughlin says at the very beginning of the lessons,you should know your scales,etc. Hes very open and frank about it. I do know that when I was first learning guitar,I hit on every single human being on the planet who played and was willing to show me what they did,no matter how advanced they were. God bless 'em. I found that the more I learned,the more I realized I had yet to learn,and that learning music is a lifetime experience. What I'm getting at, is that beginner or advanced,there is plenty of McLaughlin technique and music to soak up,and I will be going back to these dvds for a long long time.",1399248000,6,912,4.402366863905326
8390044,5,B0036K9C6O,"This is the best instructional DVD package (or book) for getting a musician up to a high level of improvisation that I've encountered yet. There are a lot of similar instructional materials that provide a list of scales, modes, etc., and some chord progressions and exercises to go with them, but these often leave the student high and dry, without a good demonstration and analysis of how the modes can be used to create real music. This DVD provides a multitutde of superb improvisations by John McLaughlin himself using the modes and chord progressions at each stage, and an analysis of how each improvisation relates to the modes, chord progressions, and exercises provided for the student. I highly recommend this, and not just for guitarists--although it's designed with guitarists in mind, any instrumentalist can learn a lot from this DVD package",1398816000,3,854,5.0638297872340425
