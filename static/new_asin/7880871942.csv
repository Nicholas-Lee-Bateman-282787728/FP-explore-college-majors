This was not a professional copy of the show this has to be a bootleg copy.",1351641600,,250,4.456521739130435
8078523,2,7880871942,"I love this drama, but the quality of this DVD set is mediocre. Two of the disk will not even play (in any reader), and one will skip and freeze unless I play it on my computer (does not work well in my DVD, Blu-ray, and Xbox players). I watch this drama on Netflix or Dramafever.com instead of watching the DVDs I bought.",1342742400,,322,4.126984126984127

Rating:  Video itself  = 5/5
English subtitles  = 1/5

We really enjoyed watching 'Playful Kiss' on Netflix, so we purchased it.  That way if someone wanted to watch it again, they could and everyone else could watch something different.  After watching it on the DVD, I'm very upset.

The English subtitles on the version we watched on Netflix had some ""rough"" translation problems, but with a little thought one could understand what was being said.  However, on the DVD version, the translation is very poor.  There are complete sentences that make no sense at all.  Furthermore,  around the 14th episode, it appears that the translator\transcriber of the English subtitles just decided to quit translating.

1]  They start using Emoticons (smiley faces, question marks, etc) rather than typing the words out.

[2]  At the same time, they started calling everyone Wu or Zu.  They called men she and females he.  What were they thinking of?

3]  They omit entire dialog exchanges.  The scene where Baek Seung Jo announces he wants to marry Oh Ha Ni, there was no subtitles at all.  If I hadn't seen it before, I would have been at a loss as to what was being said.

4]  At the wedding when Ha Ni tells Seung Jo that she now knows that he had kissed her while she was asleep on the park bench, and Ha Ni calls him an ""A**h*** in the DVD version!!!  How can I permit my grandchildren to watch this?  We were all crushed when we saw this!!

Also, I had to reset the subtitles for each episode we watched, even when we selected ""Play All"".  It was a minor inconvenience.

I am very upset with the translation of the subtitles in English on the DVD version.

I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone with children.",1336176000,,1738,4.60327868852459
8078525,5,7880871942,"First let me tell you that this movie is a ""English Subtitles"" movie. the movie start being funny,  it's about this cute girl who is almost out of high school with a crush on this very popular boy for a long time...I can't tell you more..watch it. I will tell you that is romantic..some very small drama, but mostly great to watch with the family.",1335830400,,347,4.338461538461538
8078526,2,7880871942,"I will start by stating that I LOVE this drama! The rating I am giving is for this particular DVD set. I first saw this drama on Netflix and watched it numerous times, almost memorizing most of the drama. I will say that the majority of the episodes in this set are translated very good, and close to what I had watched before. However, The last two episodes, and may I add, the most important, were butchered beyond belief. The translator was NOT the same. It was as though he didn't understand Korean or English. (Since it is also dubbed into Chinese, I assume that is who translated it.) To start with, they didn't even use the names anymore, instead using WA, ZY, LA, and other weird things when addressing each other. The wedding episode was butchered so bad I almost cried. Having the sweet young girl call her new husband an A-hole was unforgivable to me, and none of the fathers' speeches made any sense. If you haven't seen this drama before, from this point on, it really will not make much sense. They seemed to try to pick out words that were similar but never got them right. Like mixing up ""kissing in the rain"" with ""kissing on a boat"". The honeymoon was also painful to watch. What was meant to be a discovery of each others' feeling, turned out to be a confusing mess of strange random words ie. pregnancy, and an unemotional first time together. If I had not seen this before with the correct translation, I really would have hated this scene and the male lead. It doesn't get any better as it concludes. Why they changed translators I will never know, but it literally ruined this whole drama.",1335657600,,1612,4.48639455782313
8078527,5,7880871942,"I enjoyed watching Playful Kiss; I think Kim Hyun Joong is sooooooo cute and the fact that this role was total opposite from Boys Over Flowers (he was great in that role too) made it all the better. If you like Kim Hyun Joong, you'll like Playful Kiss. If you never heard of him watch Playful Kiss then Boys Over Flowers both are great Korean TV shows.",1335312000,,352,4.268656716417911
