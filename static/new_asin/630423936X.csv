822707,5,630423936X,"""Raw Deal"" is a 1948 suspense chiller that is the real film noir deal in terms of its mastery of that genre.  It is part of the great noir trilogy from low budget film studio Eagle Lion teaming director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton, which also included ""T-Men"" and ""He Walked by Night.""

The team of Mann and Alton deserves solid commendation for achieving a suspense classic with minimal costs.  It is difficult to conceive of anyone doing any better with an astronomical budget.  Here is a film occurring almost entirely within an eerie darkness centered on the escape of a convict from a prison and the unique triangle involving him and two women of disparate backgrounds and viewpoints.

Dennis O'Keefe, who also starred in Mann's ""T-Men"", is visited by girlfriend Claire Trevor, an experienced gun moll type, to tell him that she will be picking him up after the scheduled prison break slated for late that evening.  She talks about how terrible it was that he took the rap for his mob boss employer, which he passes off with a ""let bygones be bygones"" experienced acceptance.

As the story develops, however, it is obvious that O'Keefe was the victim of a raw deal, making the film's title a natural.  Raymond Burr as the mob boss has arranged the prison break with one thought in mind, believing that the odds are so long that O'Keefe figures to be killed in the process.  Plans call for a meeting shortly after the breakout between Burr and O'Keefe, but the mob boss has no intention of attending.  It will occur only if the escaping convict survives long odds.  Announcing that he has no intention of ever meeting O'Keefe, Burr sends operative John Ireland in his place with instructions to finish off the escapee if he has not been killed by police at an earlier point.

The clever romantic triangle enhancing the rapidly paced script of John C. Higgins and Leopold Atlas occurs develops after O'Keefe has Trevor stop the car so he can see Marsha Hunt who, as a paralegal, championed his cause during his trial, believing correctly that he was being framed for a crime he did not commit.  She urges him to give himself up and is thwarted after she sneaks away and picks up the telephone to call the police.  He believes Hunt to be too big a liability to leave behind and takes her with him.

It becomes increasingly obvious as time elapses that O'Keefe is in love with the lovely and sensitive younger woman Hunt rather than experienced gun moll Trevor.  At the film's conclusion during the early break of dawn O'Keefe is confronted with a decision on whether to save Hunt's life after she has been captured by Burr's mob or escape with Trevor by boat to a new life in South America.

Raymond Burr is involved in a scene reflective of Fritz Lang's noir classic ""The Big Heat"" when psychopath Lee Marvin hurls scalding coffee in the face of Gloria Grahame.  Burr is a sadistic pyromaniac who throws his fiery birthday cherries jubilee in the face of his girlfriend, played by glamorous World War Two pinup girl Chili Williams.

This is one film wherein the action never lets up.  Viewers are intrigued by a story that moves in a breakneck manner from the jailbreak in the dead of evening to the film's culmination at the next morning's daybreak.  This is one film that never disappoints and hypnotizes viewers up to its riveting conclusion.  ""Raw Deal"" gives the term hardboiled noir insightful definition and meaning.",1121040000,2,3442,4.71118530884808
822708,5,630423936X,"Anthony Mann (originally known as Emil Anton Bundesmann) is probably known by many for his taut, stylistic westerns of the early fifties (Winchester '73, Bend of the River, The Naked Spur), but many also known him from his generally low budget noir thrillers produced in the mid to late 40's for such poverty row studios as Republic and RKO.  Of these films, the favorite among fans being T-Men (1947), but I think Raw Deal (1948) holds its' own quite well, and is essential viewing for anyone interested in the genre.  The film stars Dennis O'Keefe (who appeared in the earlier Mann film T-Men), Claire Trevor (Born to Kill, Key Largo), Marsha Hunt (Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman, Jigsaw), and Raymond `Perry Mason' Burr (The Whip Hand, Bride of the Gorilla).  Also appearing is John Ireland (A Walk in the Sun, All the King's Men) and Curt Conway, who had bit parts in films like T-Men and The Naked City.

The film basically begins with Joe (O'Keefe) busting outta the joint (that's slang for escaping from prison, in case anyone was wondering).  Joe was sent up for a crime he didn't commit, as he took the rap for his friend Rick (Burr).  We learn that Rick aided in Joe's escape indirectly (greasing a few palms, I suspect), but it's not in Rick's best interests to see Joe survive the escape attempt as he owes him a large wad of cash and also he can put the finger on Rick.  In a sense, Rick feels he's giving Joe just enough rope to hang himself with, and the police will take care of his dirty business (with escaped convicts, it's always shoot first, and then shoot again, at least in films like this).  Anyway, with the help of his girlfriend Pat (Trevor), he does escape, but the police quickly throw up a dragnet, and so Joe and Pat are forced to seek refuge in the apartment of Ann (Hunt), a legal aid that worked on Joe's case.  She feels Joe should turn himself in, so they end up taking Ann with them in an effort to keep her from spilling the beans.  With Ann in tow, Joe and Pat make their way to San Francisco, hoping to catch a boat to South America, but first Joe must pay a visit to Rick and collect the money he's owed.  Little does he know Rick has other plans, ones that involve Joe taking a dirt nap...

It's pretty rare that I give out five stars, but I feel this film is deserving, as this is a case where I feel everything clicked.  Mann's direction, along with John Alton's (T-Men, He Walked by Night) cinematography combined beautifully to create a dark, rich story that drew me in so completely.  When I think noir films, images of cityscapes, shrouded by shadowy night come to mind, but here, most of the story takes place on the road, and in remote, forested areas.  Regardless of this aspect, they still managed to utilize the available elements to create one of the best films in the genre, aided by a tight script, thoughtful characters, and wonderful performances.  O'Keefe is a believable mix of criminal and hero, driven by his needs, but tortured his conscious which is drawn out by the good girl character of Ann (who finds herself attracted to the good nature that she believes lies beneath Joe's repellent exterior).  On the other side is the slightly worn character of Pat, who, in any other film would have come off as a plain old gun moll, but here she's fully developed in her own right (aided by her monotone narrative throughout the film, taking her character well beyond what I would have expected).  She desperately loves Joe, but sees him slipping away as Ann's influences take their toll.  And then there's the character of Rick, the seemingly refined, yet highly sleazy, sadistic, strong-armed antagonist with a slight case of pyromania (check out the flaming Cherries Jubilee shower his gives his mistress after she makes the mistake of bumping into him, spilling a drink on his fine duds) who's position of leadership is based not on the respect of those under him (it's rare that he does his own dirty work), but on the fact he's the biggest dog in the yard (especially the way he's filmed, at low angles to make his appearance seem that much more menacing).  Finally there's the character of Fantail (Ireland), one of Rick's henchman, who's thinly veiled contempt for his boss comes through often, but apparently lacks the will or desire to wrest control from his boss.  Another strength was the film's pacing.  The story moved along well, needing only 79 minutes to completion, and not one wasted moment throughout.  Perhaps this relatively short run time was more a product of the minimal budget, but it's immaterial as Mann gets the job done, presenting one of the finer films I've seen in awhile.  I think my favorite scene was the fistfight between Fantail and Joe in the taxidermy shop.  It's very intense, shot beautifully, and had me glued to the screen (if you ever find yourself in the position of brawling in such a place, make sure you mind the antlers).  Was there some predictability within the story?  Perhaps, but I was so taken in I rarely noticed, nor did I care.

I thought the print on this DVD released by VCI looked very good.  There's slight indications of wear, but the contrast appeared sharp and clean, and the audio very decent.  One has to remember this wasn't a major studio film, so this may be the best transfer we'll see, unless someone pops for a full-blown restoration.  Special features include a 7 minutes piece called Dark Reflections Part 2, narrated by writer Max Allen Collins (an excellent piece, by the way), and three rough looking trailers for Impact (1949), The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and Smash Up (1947).

822711,4,630423936X,"Originally released in 1948, ""Raw Deal"" is the story of a bitter, tough gangster (Dennis O'Keefe again) who seeks revenge after being framed and sent to the big house. With the help of an innocent woman he seduces, the ex con carries out his murderous scheme of vengeance, eventually coming face to face with the psychopathic pyromaniacal creep (Raymond Burr) responsible for his jail time. John Ireland, Marsha Hunt, Chili Williams and Claire Trevor co-star -- with Trevor responsible for the terrific, fatalistic voice over narration.

Mann's direction is as tight and stylized as the screenplay.  The often low angle black and white photography by John Alton, who also did ""T Men,"" is a perfect match for this tale of dark justice.  A very young, surprisingly trim,  Raymond Burr is a standout as the bad guy.  In the scene that introduces him, he gleefully burns the ear of one of his flunkies with a cigarette lighter.  It's a cruel joke and Burr obviously relishes the role of the sadistic heavy.  The quality of the full frame print is pretty good.  The sound could be a tad cleaner.  The extras are limited to some great noir trailers and ""video liner notes"" by mystery writer Max Collins.  Definitely entertaining and better than might be expected.",1022716800,9,1257,4.859154929577465
822712,4,630423936X,"I am honored to be the first reviewer of this film!  This is definitely a ""B"" noir flick in terms of the look and feel, but the script is taut and the acting is tough as nails. Some of the visuals (shot by John Alton) are as dark and as well-composed as any in Noirville--great low angle shots especially! See a pre-Perry Mason/Ironside Raymond Burr as a power-mad pyromaniac, and John Ireland as his hapless flunkie. And of course Claire Trevor as the co-dependent floozie following her man all the way to the gutter. Her laconic, downbeat voice-overs are superb, and set the emotional tone for the movie throughout. I had never seen the lead actors before--Dennis O'Keefe and Marsha Hunt, but found their portrayals quite compelling. The love story was a bit soapy but tolerable. The quality of the disc by VCI was very good in terms of the picture quality, though sound was a bit muffled. Some fun extras, including trailers from several other unrelated noir films, like Impact, and a really cool behind the scenes interview with Sinatra, Preminger, Kim Novack on the set of Man With the Golden Arm--what these are doing on this disc is beyond me, but it is a nice non sequitor nonetheless. Also, a film critic does a little analysis of Anthony Mann's style, and it is pretty darn interesting. See the companion DVD, T-Men, also an A. Mann film, but Raw Deal is the Real Deal!!",1021507200,18,1380,4.63265306122449
822713,4,630423936X,"Anthony Mann's films -- whether they are Noire, War Film, Western, or Costume Epic -- are all about one thing: characters doomed to self-destruction.  In that light ""Raw Deal"" is probably his best, because here *everyone* is going down.
O'Keefe escapes from prison, bent on collecting his dough from Crime Boss Raymond Burr, and leaving the country.  But on the way he becomes trapped between the woman who broke him out, and the beautiful parole officer they kidnapped.  Meanwhile the sadistic pyromaniac Burr has sent killer John Ireland to make sure O'Keefe meets a sticky end.
""Raw Deal"" starts as an exercise in classic film-noire style:  tough-guy dialogue, gun-play, and simple low-key sets.  Forunately (and unlike most directors), Mann is aware that these are just *noire motifs*.  So rather than produce a cliche by playing *to* them, Mann (and his collaborators Alton and Sawtell) produces a masterpiece by playing *against* them.
What would normally be a conventional revenge flick, becomes a complicated emotional journey, in the guise of an equally meandering -- occaisionally surreal -- road trip across post-war middle-America.
John Alton photographs it beautifully (the Greg Toland of B-Movies): a fight in a bait-shop takes place under a grid of black fishing nets; a woman's face reflected in the face of a ships' clock (also under a net... hmmmm); a forest at night; an alleyway choked with fog -- all of it exquisitely illuminated (or NOT illuminated, depending on your lighting philosophy).
And instead of the standard -- Dum-Da-Dum-Dum Dragnet score, composer Paul Sawtel (the Bernard Herrman of B-Movies) gives it a quivering, supernatural flavour -- with a Theramin.
The cast is perfect, particularly Ireland whose moral ambivalence can't conceal his distain for Burr and respect for O'Keefe.  And Whit Bissel does a run throught in one of the films more surreal moments.
As i said before, the characters in a Mann film are always trapped by their own weaknesses.  This is a standard B-movie/noir device, usually explained to the audience by a cynical Private-I with words like lust, betrayal, murder, etc. etc.  What sets ""Raw Deal"" apart from the ordinary Noire fodder is that we don't just observe, we sympathise.  In ""Raw Deal"" the trap isn't ""greed"" or ""lust"" -- it's loyalty, devotion, duty, and self sacrifice.  Anthony Mann's characters are doomed by their virtues, not their vices.

822992,5,630423936X,"It might be an exaggeration to say that Raw Deal is the best film noir you never heard of. However - except among hardcore noir aficionados, who hold it in high esteem, it tends to fly under the radar when the noir canon is discussed. In any case at its core RD is an offbeat love story wrapped in a veneer of a double cross/revenge story.
RD is about as noir as it gets, and is as accomplished an example of the genre/style as one is likely to find. It has first-rate direction, script, story, music. And that cast  a great collection of film noir mainstays, if not exactly household names, well, one household name anyway. Marsha Hunt especially stands out as a bleeding heart lawyer who has an eye for tough guy Dennis OKeefe. And Claire Trevor delivers a strong performance as the OKeefe characters girlfriend.
But pride of place must certainly go to Raymond Burr as a creepy villain with a thing for fire. However  if theres a true star to RD then it has to be cinematographer legend John Alton, whose murky lighting effects, almost too much so, are something to behold. A terrific movie.

The girlfriend Pat hurts her ankle on the trip, so she stays in a motel while Sullivan & Ann go to the rendesvous seeking his cut of the robbery loot. Sullivan walks into an ambush and is badly beaten at the rendesvous but Ann saves him by shooting one of the ambushers. Sullivan and Ann realize that they love each other but he releases her and puts her in a car heading home. Pat & Sullivan escape and go to San Francisco preparing to go to South America, but Sullivan's desire for revenge against Coyle won't let him merely flee. Pat finds out that the bad guys have Ann but she resists telling Sullivan until they are on the boat ready to go. Sullivan runs to rescue Ann shooting his way through a gauntlet of armed hoods and having a climactic battle with Coyle while Coyle's apartment burns. Ann gets free, but in typical noir fashion Sullivan ""doesn't make it"". This film was directed by Anthony Mann and it is really good film noir with lots of foggy night scenes - conflicted, dark characters great starkly lit camera work and of course violence.

823381,4,630423936X,"""Raw Deal"" was one of three films in the film noir style that combined the talents of director Anthony Mann with those of cinematographer John Alton. The others were ""T-Men"" (1947), a top-notch film noir brimming with identity confusion and moral chaos, and ""He Walked by Night"" (1948), a noir police procedural that inspired the television series ""Dragnet"". ""Raw Deal"" is not as strong as those other Mann/Alton collaborations in its script or its style. Nevertheless, the hard-boiled dialogue and convincing performances by Dennis O'Keefe and Claire Trevor make for an entertaining film in spite of a weak script.

Joe Sullivan (Dennis O'Keefe) stews in the State Prison after taking the wrap for his slick gangster boss Rick (Raymond Burr). He expects to be well-compensated when he gets out, but that's too long a wait for Joe. He can't stand it any longer. So his longtime girlfriend Pat (Claire Trevor) arranges to spring him. Rick agrees to pay Joe once he's out but is confident that Joe will meet his death before he can collect. The prison break is successful, but Joe and Pat are prevented from leaving town right away. They are forced to hide out with Ann Martin (Marsha Hunt), a good citizen who worked for Joe's lawyer and developed a crush on the tough-talking reprobate.

""Raw Deal"" is a cookie cutter 1940s crime thriller without much depth or cleverness. But it makes use of an interesting stylistic device. Claire Trevor, as Pat, does a sporadic voiceover narration that recalls her experiences and feelings toward Joe. It is totally unnecessary to the narrative. She doesn't explain anything. She voices her ironic and vanquished musings. This is interesting, because it gives Pat a character arc and makes the movie about her, when, on the surface of it, it is about Joe. Oddly, Pat vacillates between talking about her emotions in the past tense and in the present tense, as if we are hearing her thoughts as she has them. I don't know if the inconsistency was deliberate or careless.

I am a cautious fan of John Alton in contrast to the Alton-worship I hear from many noir fans and scholars. I find Alton's cinematography too showy at times, drawing attention to itself more than serving the film. I would not say that of ""T-Men"" or ""He Walked by Night"", which are Alton's best work in black-and-white. ""Raw Deal"", however, is so high-contrast that I often noticed the unnatural contrast more than the action. A couple of scenes are lit with a single key light that plunges most of the room into darkness in an environment where that lighting is not remotely believable. It gives the impression of a competition for who could use the fewest lights. Outdoor daylight scenes are shot with a red filter, which makes for interesting beach landscapes but absurdly contrasty mountains with black trees. There are out-of-focus headshots and dirt smeared on the lens to make things look confused and scary. It's distracting.

The character of Ann Martin is ""Raw Deal""'s other weakness. She's there to create psychic turmoil by tempting Joe to the straight and narrow. Thankfully, it is Pat she ends up affecting, so her presence in the film is not entirely clichd. But Ann is annoying, and her feelings toward Joe are changeable and inexplicable. It's not Marsha Hunt's fault. No one could make Ann's rollercoaster believable. The script is to blame. Thankfully, we have Dennis O'Keefe, who excels at playing ""average"" but tough, and the wonderful, glamorous Claire Trevor, who makes depravity irresistible. There are no bonus features or subtitles on the Classic Media 2005 DVD. The print has some flaws -specks, scratches, and a few spots, and the sound is fuzzy in a few places.",1261958400,4,3697,4.9104

823383,4,630423936X,"Director Anthony Mann and photography whiz John Alton combined for several film noirs in the late 1940s and this was one. Most of them had the same feel which meant great photography and an okay-but-nothing-spectacular story.

This one was different in that in had a female doing the narration. I wouldn't mind that but in this kind of hard-boiled film, a feminine voice such as Claire Trevor's didn't sound right. Now, if she an edge to her a la Marie Windsor or Ann Savage, fine, but Trevor's voice didn't fit. Trevor was a good noir actress, but using her for narration was a questionable choice.

It did have an apt villain, however, in Raymond Burr. The burly Burr was brutal, which means he was effective. He looked mean and sounded mean, all the way up to his 1954 ""Rear Window"" performance before going good-guy with television's Perry Mason. Dennis O'Keefe, Marsha Hunt and John Ireland also star and do a fine job. There is a lot of tough dialog in here, which is pure film noir - the kind we noir buffs enjoy!

SYNOPSIS:
Dennis O'Keefe (who bears a resemblance to Dana Andrews) is Joe Sullivan. His girlfriend Pat (Claire Trevor) helps Joe escape from prison. Their car's gas tank is hit by gunfire as they flee, so after ditching the vehicle they go to the apartment of lawyer's assistant Ann Martin (Marsha Hunt). Hearing on the radio that roadblocks are being set up everywhere, Joe steals Ann's car and forces her to accompany Pat and him.

Joe was imprisoned after taking the rap for thief Rick Coyle (Raymond Burr), and he now wants his $50,000 share of the heist money. Coyle has other ideas-- he sends henchman Fantail (John Ireland) to kill Joe at an arranged meeting. A further complication: Pat is convinced that Joe's in love with Ann.

Raymond Burr, who portrays the white-haired bad guy in Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW (1954) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/6300183513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B00003CXC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>), is evil incarnate here.

The characters are gritty and real, the plot isn't predictable and the film was recreated by the artistic team of director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton. Alton is famous for his dark moody Noir lighting and camerawork.
The Sony Wonder/Classic Media disc is remastered so the image is crisper than the previous version of this movie available on DVD.

Nothing original about this production, the video quality isn't even good, extremely poor lighting and who ever directed this release, should be ashamed of the models he/she selected.

They keep distracting poor Dennis from getting his revenge on Raymond Burr, the dirty mug what double-crossed him out of his $50,000. The entire cast is great, but Burr steals the show as the sniveling, double-crossing villain; he tosses flaming cherries jubilee into the face of a broad that's annoying him and says, ""she shoulda been more careful."" It's hilarious how Burr hides from O'Keefe, sending his goons out instead, setting ambushes... I mean, I've seen bad guys do this before, but nobody does it better than Burr!

Raw Deal's soundtack is unusual in that it utilizes a theremin, which is most commonly associated with spooky 1950s sci-fi films. The print is crisp and clean with only a few minor jumps. Audio is crystal clear.

823531,5,630423936X,"Not all Film Noir is sinister, negative, or about gangsters. Some of it is about detectives and undercover cops, and is very heroic. What I like best about it are the low-key lighting effects and extreme camera angles, the grittiness and heightened drama and action, as well as the effects designed to create a mood of mystery, like fog. How could you not create a great suspense thriller in a setting like that?

For this genre, one of the finest directors was Anthony Mann, and one of the most interesting actors was Dennis O'Keefe. Their pairing in T-MEN and RAW DEAL delivers two of the best examples of Film Noir, though not nearly as well known as films like The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity. Mann was a top-notch director who went on to direct Jimmy Stewart in such westerns as Winchester '73, Bend of the River, The Far Country, and The Man From Laramie; as well as sand and sandal epics, like El Cid and Fall of the Roman Empire.

O'Keefe was a top-notch actor who did a decade of extra work at the beginning of the sound era, before he was discovered and recommended as a leading man by Clark Gable. After that he starred in a variety of comedies and dramas in the 40's and 50's. He also worked for the fledgling medium of television, making guest appearances on such shows as Robert Montgomery Presents, Studio One, and Lux Video Theatre; as well as starring in his own TV show in 1959. He's a very likable actor, even when he plays a convict.

In T-MEN, O'Keefe and a fellow treasury detective go undercover and risk their lives to break up a counterfeiting ring. In RAW DEAL, O'Keefe plays a wrongly convicted felon who escapes from prison looking for revenge, kidnaps his lawyer's secretary who has been visiting him in prison, and is ultimately redeemed by her from his course of self-destruction. There is actually a double-redemption in RAW DEAL that gives it a nice twist.

About the cinematography: John Alton gives a visual look to these two films that can only be described as powerful. In RAW DEAL, the scene on the boat with the clock in the background will never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. The scenes in the steam baths in T-MEN, and the fight scene in the backroom of the beachside shop in RAW DEAL are also memorable.

823532,4,630423936X,"Director Anthony Mann displays a deft directorial touch in his low budget dark, dusky film noir drama ""Raw Deal"".

Burly Dennis O'Keefe playing incarcerated criminal Joe Sullivan breaks out of the California State penitentary, aided by his gang moll girlfriend the life fatigued Pat Cameron played by Claire Trevor.  O'Keefe is endeavoring to seek out crime boss Rick Coyle played by star of the movie Raymond Burr.  O'Keefe was sent away covering for Burr and is owed $50,000 for his part in a robbery.  The ruthless psychotic Burr imbued with pyromaniacal tendencies has set up O'Keefe's escape hoping that he'll be killed in the process.

On the lam, O'Keefe and Trevor seek refuge in the apartment of a legal aide Ann Martin played by Marsha Hunt who helped O'Keefe during his trial and has visited him in prison.  Hunt is taken as a reluctant hostage by the pair.  It readily becomes apparent that O'Keefe and Hunt are attracted to each other and the old trustworthy but shopworn Trevor now has competition for O'Keefe's affections.

The trio now make their way towards San Francisco averting police, roadblocks and other trouble for the inevitable showdown with Burr. O'Keefe tells Hunt to beat it but she gets picked up by Burr's henchman Fantail played by John Ireland. Given a chance to escape the country aboard a freighter with Trevor in tow, O'Keefe flees the ship to rescue Hunt when he learns that Burr has kidnapped her.

Filmed skillfully by John Alton is the murky foggy streets of San Francisco, this classic film noir setting helps set the somber mood of the film.  Mann displays a perchant for some terrific camera angles.  Particularly effective was one where we see the reflection of Trevor's guilty face in a clock in the cabin of the freighter when she reveals that her rival Hunt is in Burr's clutches.",1141171200,3,1827,4.842443729903537

The basic story involves a love triangle between an escaped convict, his loving and helpful girl friend and a legal assistant who visited the convict in prison. The three set off to escape and O'Keefe to exact revenge on the big boss who set him up to cheat him of his share of ill gotten loot.

All the players do well, especially I thought Raymond Burr playing the big boss with bursts of evil that are very compelling.

At the time, Crowther panned the movie: ""Except for the usual moralto wit, that crime does not paythe only thing proved by this picture is that you shouldn't switch sweethearts in mid-lam.""

Sixty years on it plays much better for this noir enthusiast.
