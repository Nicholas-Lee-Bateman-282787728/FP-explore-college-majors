8240921,1,B001187N6Y,"For over thirty-five bucks this DVD is a rip off, and given its quality, it is worth no more than five bucks.

I can't help but notice that at least half of the script dialogue mirrors almost exactly the dialogue in Frank Capa's Battle of Russia, including a lot of the footage used in that combat information film. I don't know which came first, Frank Capa or Edward G. Robinson.  And Tradition owns the copy right to this???

In any event, if someone wants a good copy contact the National Archives. The  ""Tradition"" copy is of very poor quality.  I was hoping that for over thirty bucks that they would have cleaned the film up. They didn't.  As a matter of fact they made lousy copies too, which are overly pixilated.

And yes it would be child's play to clean up the sound track. And yes again I have bought about a hundred films from the US Archives. For the most part most are squeaky clean, Especially the Seven Combat Information Films made by Capa.

I also purchased a copy of the Battle of the Somme from the British Imperial War Museum. The footage looked like it was shot yesterday, and that was shot, what a hundred years ago.

Anyway the National Archives is the way to go.  They don't rip you off like some of these wanna be Video Companies. Tradition spends more time making empty threats about copying a film that is already in the public domain, instead of producing a quality product. They should spend more of their efforts to restoration.  That way they may keep a loyal customer base.

I wouldn't mind paying thirty bucks or more for a copy for a film that is correctly restored.  The dumbest threat made by Tradition is that they use a Dampening Technology that is suppose to damage your equipment, if you attempt to copy the DVD.  Dampening Technology, really, that's a stretch.",1420243200,5,1803,4.5246913580246915

Although black and white and aged, it is an important historical record worth viewing.",1386979200,3,271,5.181818181818182
