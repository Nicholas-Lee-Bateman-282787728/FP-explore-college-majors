8157204,1,B000KJTBU6,The title is appropriate. Everyone involved should have stopped filming immediately and went home to get a good night sleep.,1437609600,,124,5.25
8157205,5,B000KJTBU6,"A truly raw and gritty film that speaks to young people. This global award winning independent film is perhaps the best that Kenya Cagle has offered. The dialogue is real, the martial arts superb. This film opened the door for hundreds of thespians. Charlie is a street thug raised by a good family. He is arrested and given a half a million dollars bail. The only one in their family who has that kind of money is Charlie's uncle, family therapist Kenneth. Against the advice of his wife, Kenneth secretly put up everything he has for Charlie including his house and cars. Once Charlie is released on bail, he decides to skip town ruining his uncle and going on a murder spree. Realizing that Charlie has become a serial killer, black belt Uncle Kenneth and his crackhead brother decide to track Charlie down and take him out themselves. Good martial arts scenes by Soke Rasul Nasir and Tactical Dojo. Great acting performances by Anthony Jackson and Ernest Dancy.",1385683200,,965,4.75
8157206,5,B000KJTBU6,"Great example of guerilla filmmaking. Caglevision was in rare form as they produced their first feature film with real martial arts techniques and practitioners trained by Soke Rasul Nasir. Kimberly Shay Jones is in rare form. What would you do if someone you loved and posted $500,000 bond for decides to skip town on his court date. Then what if he is a martial artist and psycho killer. Do you take the lost or go to bring him in court.",1384646400,,439,4.5
