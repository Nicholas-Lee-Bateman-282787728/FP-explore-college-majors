2331480,4,B0009WSO6Q,"I got hooked on this Korean soap opera when I rented it from Netflix.
I was surprised I loved this so much as I am not Korean and not very familiar with the culture, but with good english subtitles (sometimes a bit much) I rented it twice.

I decided to buy the DVD set but have to return it since the subtitles were way too fast for me to keep up with or understand.

This is in no way the sellers fault. I was very happy with the quality of the picture and everything else, and would buy from this seller again.

I must also say, the music in this is beautiful as well.",1430092800,4,571,3.991228070175439
2331481,5,B0009WSO6Q,"This one is my favorite.  From start to finish.. then watching it a second time..  eventually a third time.. and soon enough a fourth time.  My favorite story of all time.. with my favorite actress of all time.  A classic even for the Korean Wave.  It is storys and art like this.. that succeed where war guns and bombs cannot.  The cultural influence created in Korea has advanced their nation to the top.  Two childhood friends forced to part, promised to reunite, but fate and nefarious people  have a different plan.  A story of love that will not stop.  Bring tissue this is a beautiful tear jerker!  This is also the YA entertainment version.. which means it is the top notch quality product for english speakers.  It is not a third world rip off made in someone garage.  This story grabbed me and took me for a ride i could not get off.",1423353600,,843,4.431372549019608

2331485,4,B0009WSO6Q,"Stairway to Heaven is a take off from Cinderella. You have all the elements here: the evil stepmother, the evil stepsister, the sort of clueless father, the really disturbed stepbrother, the handsome rich prince (Kwon Sang-woo) and of course, the victim (Choi Ji-woo). The prince and the victim grew up together, both came from well-to-do families, although Song-Joo (Kwon's character) was outright rich. He loved Jung-seo, Choi's character, with all his heart. Jung-Seo is a quiet, happy girl who looks for the good in people. Her father remarries and life as she knew it ends. It becomes hell. Song-joo goes off to study abroad, leaving Jung-seo behind. When he returns to Korea, just before he is to meet up with her again, a terrible car accident happens, and Jung-seo is hit and loses her memory. She does not remember Song-joo. The evil step family plots to keep them apart. It's a good drama but really I just wanted to shake Jung-seo and tell her to get some courage and stop being a victim! Always wanting to please, always being the victim got tiring really quick. Kwon Sang-woo was great. What a handsome man! The evil characters were well-played. I'd really give it a 3.5 but I couldn't so I rounded up. It's a sob-story to enjoy. 2003",1374710400,4,1247,4.751152073732719

2331489,3,B0009WSO6Q,"I watched Stairway to heaven years ago when it first came out. It's a great drama. However, the version I saw on cable t.v. in Hawaii had much better english translations. I was not aware there were different versions. The one I received seems to have been reproduced in Hong Kong and the default dubbing they had it at was chinese. At first I was worried it did not have subtitles at all as the subtitles cannot be found in the main menu. Depending on your DVD player you can press the subtitle button and they have various languages. It seems the version I have was translated in China as many of the names are romanized into Chinese names and the contractions, verbs and words are often misused or misspelled. It is almost unwatchable as the subtitles are so poorly written. So for American/English speaking viewers just be cognizant that there are several translated versions.",1323820800,,880,4.683870967741935
2331490,5,B0009WSO6Q,"It took a long time to get and I wished I had known that as I thought it was lost....but the movie Stairway to Heaven was worth it as I ordered it as a gift for a friend.
Was very impressed when I saw that it came from Hong Kong !!!
I would do business with the dealer again - with pleasure !!!",1307836800,,294,3.6825396825396823
2331491,5,B0009WSO6Q,"Stairway to heaven truly hits the soul and opens the mind. I loved the creative and very beautiful musical scenes throughout. Starting the movie with the white grand piano on the beach quickly grabbed my attention and made me want for more. This movie is definitely a musicians getaway. The actors were perfect and played their parts so well. To see such sensitivity yet lack of affection as we are used to too starts a new sense of desired behavior from our loved ones.

The competition for one's heart and the way the drama sways from one point in time- from the younger days to the present day gives the viewer a chance to get to the source of how it all began and gives us a lot of background knowledge to give the heart and soul the maximum emotional effect.

Using the composers skills and creation to swing our interests in such a unique way gave me-the composer and song artist the desire to create again. Seeing the emotional healing that the music gave as well as the memory that is relived through a familiar tune can bring in deep thoughts and senses to the surface of emotions that previously were hidden deep down right to the present.

I felt a heavenly aura from the beginning and kept thinking...hmmmm am I gonna experience a heaven like experience watching this??? Great movies do that...keeps you asking questions and wondering what's next always hungering for more.

Going back to the beach house or the private recording house was an eerie way of creating our own desire to go to our own favorite spot in our own lives. Each location seemed remotely beautiful but very secluded to the privacy and intimacy of each scene. Just perfectly set up to keep the audience captive.

I loved the musical creation, the talent that was included was at the superb level for each person that sang, played the piano or guitar. The desire to help the helpless and the push for excellence all in one movie is very hard to find.

Korean drama has taken TV to the next level. Stairway to Heaven has captured the audience of the young and old alike. We come home  and find ourselves begging the person at the tv to please go back a scene or two. I gotta see what happened first.",1307491200,,2179,4.5152284263959395
2331492,5,B0009WSO6Q,"This drama is very beautiful. The characters are very loving and kind. Unlike most kdramas, the main characters are both very sweet. The situations they find themselves in, though, are constantly pulling apart their love. But they always overcome. The writer and director worked hard to express real love beyond the bonds of normality. I would recommend if you are a very passionate person with some spare time on your hands. Sometimes this drama seems drawn out, but every episode is like a dream. I enjoyed it thoroughly, even the times when I cried so hard that I lost my breath.",1304035200,,582,4.772277227722772
2331493,5,B0009WSO6Q,"The set from Amazon is as pictured: 7 discs in Korean language with English subtitles in a nice box.
I really enjoyed this Korean drama series set. It is a love triangle and is about real love,sacrifice, and ultimately forgiveness. This film was perfect-the actors/actresses were really believable and had such great chemistry. When seeing this it is hard not to get teary-eyed. In fact that is the mood of the whole film but also there were some suspenseful and some funny parts.  Of course there are a few elements of the film that are ridiculous to believe, but it is overall a well done series. Also, the music is very fitting.

I watched it probably three times already and it was just as good everytime. Good drama and nice package, well worth watching and owning.

Basically---Han Jung Suh and Cha Song-Joo have been very close since they were very little. There for each other through the good times and bad times such as when each one of their parents died. They had planned to study abroad together, but then Jung Suh's father remarries wicked Tae-Mi-ra. Tae-Mi-ra convinces Jung Suh's father to make Jung Suh stay at home. ..so years past as they wait to meet each other again. With people holding them back, there are obstacles they must overcome until that happens...",1300924800,,1280,4.7309417040358746
2331494,3,B0009WSO6Q,"As a recent K-drama fan (I've only watched 5 series so far) I was excited to get this one because of all the positive reviews I read.  The series started out great... very entertaining, typical endings that left you wanting more, solid acting.  However, around episode 12/13 the series and the scenes began to drag on and on and the plot became more cliched.  I only finished the series because I wanted to see how it ended.  At the close of the last episode, I definitely felt that it was not worth my time to have watched it.  There are much better dramas out there than this one.  I'd recommend reading the plot summary on wiki or some other such website and purchasing a more entertaining and fulfilling drama!",1268265600,,714,4.496124031007752
2331495,5,B0009WSO6Q,"This is a film that will capture all of your emotions and your honesty all at once.  All I can say is WATCH IT!!!  It is about strong love and not ever give up on someone you've made promise from the beginning.  Keeping your word and honor while going through the deceits and lies and the JEALOUSY that comes in your way to prevent you to ever keep that PROMISE!!!  And no matter what, you ACCEPT the OUTCOME no matter what.

2331497,4,B0009WSO6Q,"This drama is a classic case of a drama that went 5-7 episodes too long (there are 20 total episodes).

Apparently, this drama has taken some of the best elements of ""Autumn in My Heart"" and ""Winter Sonata"" and added some originality. And it works at many levels. Its music is very memorable. The acting is superb and Choi Ji Woo gave the best performance of her career especially as a blind Jung Suh.

There are many memorable scenes and lines which render you helpless from the urge to shed tears. If you like a good love story, then this drama will leave little wanting.

The problem is this drama has redundant scenes and themes that become tiresome after about 5 cycles. For example, Jisoo (JungSuh) repeatedly commits to Chulsoo (TaeHwa) and swears off seeing SongJoo, only to see SongJoo again for about 8 more times until she finally makes her choice. The drama of her resisting seeing SongJoo wore off after about 5th time, after which you wish she would get things going already. But that dosen't happen until 3 episodes later.

One of the main antagonist is played by Kim Tae Hee who poseesses possibly the most perfect face of any actress. Scientists who study beauty based on the Golden Rato (1.618) have concluded Kim TaeHee posesses the most perfect beautiful face. Her role as Yuri was her cameo role and she became a major star despite playing an evil antagonist in this drama.

One of the most memorable scenes was in episode 18, when blind JungSuh and SongJoo meet for Jungsuh to break off their relationship due to her blindness. Jungsuh does everything she could to hide her blindness and tells SongJoo that she has moved on and he should marry someone else. SongJoo, knowing full well she is blind and her desire to unburden him of her blindness, falsely and heartwrenchingly agrees.

The other memorable scene is when TaeHwa meets blind Junsuh for the last time before he sacrificies himself so Jungsuh could see. TaeHwa lies he will be moving to Paris so it will be diffiult for them to meet again. When blind JungSuh sweetly insists they should meet again and exchange letters, he reluctantly says ""yes"", knowing full well that was their last possible meeting.

TaeHwa, beautifully played by Shin Hyun Joon, was the most interesting character. His last words were: ""I was born to a devil in this hellish world. JungSuh was the only person who loved and cared for me. She made my life worth living and there is nothing I will not do for her. Through my sacrifice for JungSuh I will be entering heaven from this hellish world"".",1230422400,5,2550,4.678571428571429
2331498,5,B0009WSO6Q,"I loved watching this movie... but I wish that any of the soaps that starred the lead, it would have a happy ending. You'll cry that's for sure. One thing about this, I agree with a previous poster... the stepmother is definitely EVIL!!! And the stepsister plays crazy pretty well.  Definitely a must buy.",1218585600,,305,4.648148148148148
2331499,5,B0009WSO6Q,"Stairway to Heaven - What can I say about this series - In a few words - GREAT - TERRIFIC - LOVED IT.  You must understand the series is about 20 hours long - at some points you are crying and some points you get angry with all the crazy family issues that take place.  The Step mom is EVIL - the Father is a DUD (he needs acting classes), The main characters ROCK.  Towards the end you will cry and you will laugh.  I also recommend ""Winter Sonata""",1207094400,5,449,4.01123595505618
