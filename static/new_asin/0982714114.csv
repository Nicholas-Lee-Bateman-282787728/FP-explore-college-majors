8583245,5,0982714114,"Look Who's Signing Part 2 K-Z is a must see to continue learning sign language after viewing part 1! My kids are learning their alphabet along with the basic signs, in American Sign Language, that are introduced in these videos. They are both educational and entertaining so I don't mind letting them watch it over and over.  Did I mention there are opposites and Spanish words included in this DVD! Can't wait to see more products from Express Yourself Baby!",1278979200,,459,4.7375
