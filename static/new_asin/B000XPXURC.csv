8229012,1,B000XPXURC,"As a producer of historical documentaries myself, I buy many books and videos via Amazon. Lately, my focus has been military history.
  This little piece of video was a complete waste of money: They just took some old footage from the National Archives. It was supposed to be about treating the wounded in the Viet Nam war.
  All it included was about ten minuted of soldiers playing vollyball, and about one minute of a nurse giving some felloe a shot. PERIOD!!! That was it. No value whatsoever!
