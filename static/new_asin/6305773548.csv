8389490,4,6305773548,"Though less arty than the oshima classic, this erotic tale of l'amour fou is a stunning film in its own right.  You get much more of the lead characters life.  Its beautifully made, well acted.  It's also less hermetic than oshima's masterpiece, making less artistic, but a little easier to watch and enjoy.  Higherly recommended for fans of classic Japanese erotic cinema!",994032000,11,373,4.967741935483871
