8251072,1,B0013HXB1E,"After reading the 5 star reviews, I bought this DvD. And I can only ask...Why god...? Why?

1. Acting..SUCKED.
2. Special effects ...wait, where were the special effects?..ok maybe there were some..maybe.
3. Storyline... yes.. theres a killer after us...

This is just another example of a filmed ""on location"" in my mommies basement movie. Why is it that every oxygen thief with a hd camcorder thinks they are a movie maker? Guess what, your're NOT!

Don't buy this movie!!! You will regret every agonizingly bad moment of it. I consider myself someone who likes cheesey movies...but this isn't even good enough to be cheesey. I never really research the reviewers BUT ..I just happened to notice that one of them STARS in the movie. Wait I shouldnt say the word star ....had a role in this movie.

This is just a pathetic attempt at a ""lets just throw it out there and maybe we can make a lil money"" movie. Well they got me. But hopefully after reading this, they won't get you! Save your 10.99 and use it to get your teeth drilled, it will be much more enjoyable!",1393545600,,1066,4.56544502617801
8251073,5,B0013HXB1E,"I liked everything about this movie, the only thing I want to say is not a bad comment but more of a tip for the next movie you guys make ( Hint: the reporter goes psycho and he starts copy catting the murders ) but also you guys should act yourselves don't try too hard on keeping a straight face while saying your lines and actually sometimes it's even good to twist up one of the lines and say it the way you would really say it for example instead of saying something like ""No we can't go out there because he's probably waiting for us"" you should say something like ""Hell no we can't go out there that crazy **** is waiting for us"" you know what I mean? but overall I liked the movie and the environment it took place in and the gory scenes that **** was awesome. you guys keep doing what your doing and you'll get better at it. Thank You",1363392000,,843,4.0843373493975905
8251074,5,B0013HXB1E,"I really enjoyed this movie!  For something that was made on a small budget and now on amazon, I'm impressed.  It's a really fun movie to sit down and watch, and not very long either. I recommend this this indie slasher to any person that enjoys a good, fun movie.",1225238400,,264,4.26
8251075,5,B0013HXB1E,"I had the extreme pleasure of viewing this film with the director and I must say Basic Slaughter is a refreshing and original spin on the stagnant slasher genre. Filled with clever writing and unique kills, Basic Slaughter delivers, even for such a micro budgeted production. This film belongs with Hatchet and Behind the Mask as a revival of classic American Horror. I highly recommend this film to any Horror fan dissatisfied with both the torture porn genre and the PG-13 garbage horror Hollywood is spewing out.",1202428800,,515,4.931034482758621
8251076,5,B0013HXB1E,"I may be slightly biased, since I'm in this movie. I do own an advanced copy, because of this. I believe that guys who are really into video games and enjoy comic book conventions, will love this. There's plenty of funny sound effects and a few some what gorey scenes. Lots of humor and some action. Plenty of genre references in the dialogue. For something that was filmed very quickly, without rehearsal, it's quit good. All of the actors have little or no previous experience. That just makes it even more amazing at how well the finished product came out. It always makes me laugh! There are a few special features on the DVD. All in all, if you're a fan of this kind of film, you will love it. If not, you'll probably hate it.",1202256000,4,731,4.382352941176471
