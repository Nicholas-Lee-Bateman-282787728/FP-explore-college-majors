7874865,3,6304619871,"This is the fourth volume in the famed BLACK JACK OAV series, based on Osamu Tezukas pioneering manga about a maverick medical doctor of extraordinary skill and daring who takes only the toughest, most demanding jobs. Its a rather unusual anime series in that the stories are always dead serious, carefully and deliberately paced and filled with cutaways to picturesque details of the often exotic settings. More importantly, the series pays close clinical attention to medical details that some viewers might find repellent. The animators never shy away from surgical operations and closeups of internal organs and the strange parasites, infections, and bacterial agents that Black Jack never seems to tire of finding and removing. (This may be the only anime series to require a medical adviser.)
The story here focuses on a French movie actress who develops a strange illness preventing her from eating and is forced to go into hiding with Black Jack and her doctor uncle to try and find the cause of the condition. Only when Black Jack investigates the remote village where the star grew up does he find the deadly secret that explains the mystery. Also on hand is Dr. Kiriko, a Dr. Kevorkian-like rival of Black Jacks, whose specialty is enabling the most agonized patients to die painlessly and in peace. Black Jack at first deeply resents Dr. Ks presence on the scene, but finds his encyclopedic knowledge a welcome resource at a crucial moment for his patient. It's an intricate and moving tale and ranks among the better BLACK JACK volumes.
Director Osamu Dezaki chose to depart from the rounded, cartoonish style employed by Tezuka in his ""Black Jack"" manga and imbued the OAV series with his usual brand of elegant, baroque visuals, strong on detail, color and atmosphere and peppered with clinical nude scenes (of patients!) and body fluids. Dezaki is also known for SPACE ADVENTURE COBRA and the sex-and-violence-drenched crime thrillers, THE PROFESSIONAL: GOLGO 13 and GOLGO 13: QUEEN BEE, compared to which the BLACK JACK series seems positively tame.",1058745600,,2066,5.079411764705882
