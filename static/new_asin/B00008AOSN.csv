1834217,1,B00008AOSN,"Why is good anime often under represented or under understood (if that is a word)? Greed. FLCL is a great anime. But it's only 6 episodes at around 3 hrs. Yet somehow the DVD makers felt is necessary to split a 3-hour series over 3 DVDs and charge nearly $30.00 bucks a piece for them. I don't buy my anime in the U.S. I buy it overseas. Sure I may have to read subtitles, and I might occasionally even unintentionally be purchasing a pirated property (which I try to avoid by usually buying from a select number of dealers and by paying attention to the name of the DVDs' producers) but when I can buy an entire 26-episode series (like Cowboy Bebop or Witch Hunter Robin) on 3 DVDs for less than the price of one of those DVDs in the U.S. that only has three or four episodes of the same series (with all the ""extras"" - some sketchbook drawings & trailers for other DVDs aren't exactly extras in my book!), I'll pick reading any day (especially since dubbed English DVDs are becoming more prevalent overseas). DVD producers will say that they have to charge that much because it's a niche market, etc. All I can think is that it will never stop being a niche market until people can see an entire series without having to pay $100.00-$300.00 to watch it.",1083542400,18,1255,4.390557939914163
1834218,5,B00008AOSN,"Naota, the young teenager who is the central character in this imaginative series finds himself in the envious position of having two women dote on him.  One of these is Ninamori, the young daughter of the mayor of Mabase, and the other is Haruko, an attractive 'alien' who has moved into his house as maid.  Or this would be an envious position if Ninamori didn't want him to play the cat in the school play - Puss and Boots.  And the perpetually effusive Haruko loves Naota for the space warp between the hemispheres of his brain.
Ninamori has her own problems, a philandering father, a home that is falling apart, and a desperate need to hide her feelings behind a veneer of adult maturity.  Like Naota, life has become too complicated and efforts to reign it in wind up creating new monsters that spring unbidden from one's brain.  Haruko is that shaman who brings these things to the surface.  Whether they be creatures from outer or inner space, we don't know, but like a mad psychiatrist, Haruko presides over their birth and their final demise.
In the second episode on this DVD a baseball game becomes Haruko's metaphor, as she and Naota play on opposite sides in the game.  Despite having his brother's bat, Naota seems unable to play, while Haruko, who hits equally well with both bat and base guitar, is apparently the next best thing to Mickey Mantle.  Naota's frustration includes not just his failure at sports, but a dark jealousy over Haruko's relationship with his father.  He hides behind his powerlessness, unwilling to take any risks, while Haruko keeps telling him that nothing will happen until he swings the bat.
This is possible the zaniest series in modern anime.  Haruko runs the gamut from being an object of innuendo to acting like one of those Zen masters that leap out of nowhere to hit you with a stick until you learn to avoid the beating.  She has her own agenda, which might include saving the earth or turning the unsuspecting Naota into something greater than his own expectations.  As of yet, the bemused viewer has no clue.
Again, the series benefits from extensive director's commentary.  Not that this ever quite explains anything, but it provides many reassurances that it is the series, and not the viewer, that is insane.  Outstanding are and music fill out the bill, making FLCL a must see for the anime aficionado and amateur psychologist alike.",1080518400,16,2391,4.757869249394673
1834219,5,B00008AOSN,"After a brilliant first DVD, Gainax, I.G. and Synch-Point makea second that is just incredible to house the 3rd & 4th episodes of this 6 episode OVA series.  While the stories through episode 3 provide fun little scenarios with some of the most brilliant, crazed action and music in any anime, they really just boggle the audience while delighting them.  But, like any decent story, the writer will put out the pieces, then tie them together, which they do into episode 4 as Hara-haru's history shows up as a human boyfriend working for a central intelligence organization dealing with aliens on earth.  Into episodes 5 & 6, on the 3rd DVD are most all of the answers needed to rope up a great excuse to make fantastic anime fun.
Each episode of FLCL has a very strong motif.  In episode 3, it is predominantly about 'Puss In Boots' while episode 4 is a great nod to baseball.  There is something fantastic to watch in every scene of FLCL.  This is not an anime to ignore.",1079136000,9,972,4.525714285714286
1834220,5,B00008AOSN,"FLCL IS THE BEST anime that has been played in America. It includes everything their is of a good anime, robots, fighting, guns,aliens, romance, mystery, etc. Even though I still didn't understand what fooly cool means after watching it 5 times. I wish the game can have extentions ( Video games, new seasons) that would be alsome. Buy it NOW! every cent of your 70 bucks is going to worth it!",1077926400,3,393,4.549295774647887
1834221,5,B00008AOSN,"This is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of anime.  I was blown away by this oustanding series.  Its got everything, top-end animation, great music, deep storyline, comedy, robots coming out of peoples heads and then battling intensely.  From the very first episode I saw, I knew it was the best show I have ever seen.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars and then a hundred more.  I suggest buying it the nanosecond after you finish reading this.",1075248000,4,441,4.329268292682927

Great work for any self-respecting fan to get.

1834223,5,B00008AOSN,"When I first saw FLCL, I knew it was pure gold. It was hilarious, strange, crazy, hard to understand, and that is a good Anime in my opinion. Of course, there ARE some serious parts, like the part where Naota Nandaba AKA Ta-kun tells Haruko Haruhara he loves her and kisses her.
Anyway, this Anime is about a boy named Naota Nandaba, and an Alien-girl named Haruko Haruhara nearly runs him over while he is hanging out with Samejima Mamimi, one of his older girl friends. This leaves a mark on his forehead, and before he knows it, Naota has robots and cat ears growing out of his head. And THEN Haruko becomes Naota's maid and his dad falls in love with her. Strange, hai? This is, it's just great. Hilarious. GOLD! 10000/10.",1063411200,5,726,4.466165413533835
1834224,5,B00008AOSN,"Simply the most amazing piece of artwork ever developed.  From the stylized use of digitized manga to the amazing group of animators that worked on the projects.  Tsurumaki's vision and depth is amazing (especially since he is right handed).  Oh, and don't forget the amazing fight scenes with some of the most fantastic robots you can imagine.
Watch as Naota finds his way from elementary school to adulthood with the help of Haruko and fights his way through his own feelings to discover that he should just be himself.  On the path he has to fight his way through a myriad of amazing Medical Mechanicca robots.
This disk also has my favorite ""fight scene"" of all time, as Naota finally swings away!  The imagery and concept are amazing, and the animation is breathtaking.  Couldn't pick better music either - The Pillows' music fits perfectly.
Even though each disk is only 2 episodes, there is also an hour of commentary from Tsurumaki (director) that is nearly as riveting as the show itself.  Also, a LOT of the nuances in the show are directed at Japanese culture and the anime biz.  Even if you don't understand it all until afterwards, it is still an amazing show.
Buy all 3 of them right now, because you will be begging for more the moment it ends.",1063411200,17,1259,4.63963963963964
1834225,5,B00008AOSN,"This series is some of the best television you
will find.  It is one of the rare times that
the script expects the viewer to be able to
follow a story without conventional plot points
or clichs.  The graphic style is refreshing
and unusual.  Like ""The Prisoner"" or ""The Singing
Detective"" this series is best understood after
viewing the entire series.  While there are
some subtle culture references that we in the U.S.
may miss, the story is universal and very human,
despite Anime and Sci-fi trappings.",1062460800,4,505,4.7701149425287355
1834226,5,B00008AOSN,"This series is, in short, a great masterpiece that showcases skill within confusion.
I don't even have the words to describe what you're thinking of buying.
Its a three DVD series, six episodes.  Each episode has an english audio track, a japanese, and finally the director's japanese explanation track.  It can often be worth rewatching with the director's track going, he explains a lot of japanese nuances.
That is where 90% of the confusion comes from actually.  Most of the show makes sense only to a person from japan, because thier culture is so different.  the other 10% is from scenes and dialog that actually are intended to cause confusion.
The story is that of a grade school boy growing up....realizing that the most grown up thing he can do is just be a kid (instead of trying to act like an adult).
Its animation is TOP NOTCH, and will often drop your jaw.  the audio and soundtrack are awesome.  The english dub is actually quite good...but I often find myself also viewing the japanese subbed version.
Do yourself a favor and buy this while you can.  the company that distributed this set only printed a limited number of copies due to its lack of marketability.  I had trouble finding all three.  Buy them while you can.",1062288000,6,1238,4.668202764976958
7981303,5,B00008AOSN,"I've seen it, sometimes at least once a week,for the last 3 years,and continue to be amazed by all the corny ideas that flow from all six episodes of this wacky anime.",1403827200,,167,4.25

it is sooooo good!  As a now 'seasoned Otaku', one who has seen his thousandth series... I hold this as one of the finest animes ever made.  This series is going to stand the test of time, it is an absolute classic.  A story of a young boy hitting that awkward age and encountering a girl that sends his world into an adventure he never saw coming!.. Haruhara Haruka, Naota, and all the rest of the crazy gang - what is most apparent to Anime fans is the collage of styles that are peppered throughout the entire set... just masterful!

2. I've watched it many times over. The writing and the animation are both excellent.
3. The best way to fully grasp the depth of the story is to watch with English audio and director commentary as the subtitle. Awesome.",1384300800,,345,4.3076923076923075

7981307,4,B00008AOSN,"I said I would stop with the first Disc, because of the cost.  But it turns out that there are only six episodes, so it, in the end, does not cost an arm and a leg.  Just an arm.  I mean, six episodes split up among three DVDs.  That still, in the end, costs a lot.  Let's face it, the music is cool, the artwork is amazing and the story is nonsense.  It is just pure fun.  Maybe even more fun if you do drugs.  In these episodes we have baseball but only one robot.  And it does not even come out of Naota's head.  Then there's the cat ears and the curry.
The extras are nice, such as the outakes, but in the end it still costs too much!  Still, only one disc left to go.",1221350400,,672,3.832116788321168
7981308,5,B00008AOSN,"Alas, poor Naota. Not only does he consider his life totally uneventful and boring, but strange things continue to emerge from his head.

And while there's a brief lull of (relative) normalcy in the second volume of ""FLCL (Fooly Cooly),"" don't expect it to last for long. The third and fourth episodes of this most bizarre of animes grow even more surreal as Naoto tackles descending satellites, giant eyebrows, batting and a hi-tech doppelganger of someone close to him. And it's finally revealed just why things keep coming out of his head.

Naota is understandably annoyed when he's forced to be the cat in a school production of ""Puss in Boots,"" and the mayor's daughter Ninamori is constantly nagging him. Ninamori has some problems of her own, since her parents are going to divorce and her father may be arrested, so the faux-cynical girl is obsessively focusing on the school play.

But when she touches Naota's latest cranial eruption -- a pair of cat ears -- Ninamori gets infected with whatever is affecting Naota. And Ninamori's true motives for the school play are revealed... right before another cranial eruption causes mass mayhem at Naota's school. Can he somehow save his classmate, or will Haruko have to come to the rescue with superspicy curry?

And that was the normal episode, for your information. What follows more than makes up for the lack of surreality.

Naota technically plays baseball, but cannot bring himself to ever swing the bat --  except, we find, when he's swinging at machines. And he finds himself troubled and jealous when he hears his father and Haruko seemingly having sex -- and further confused when a strange man with monstrous eyebrows comes in, and gives him cryptic advice about Haruko. Apparently this guy not only knows her, but knows her strange goals.

Naoto's vaguely Oedipal problems come to a head -- literally -- when he whacks his robotic dad dead... only to find out what Haruko has been trying to do to his REAL dear ol' dad. Oh yes, and a satellite with a bomb on board is about to strike the city they live in, and Haruko's batting skills may be the only thing between humanity and mass devastation.

""FLCL (Fooly Cooly)"" is an anime so bizarre, so surreal, so headscratchingly wacky that you cannot watch it without wondering if someone spiked your drink. And it takes the opportunity to mock many of the tropes in anime series -- not-so-subtle sexual overtones (""If I rush, it won't pop. Go slow!""), underwear, insane alien girls, random monsters appearing, and alien robots.

And while the third episode is weird, the fourth is a cornucopia of utter strangeness -- including hallucinations, energy guitars, the Galaxy Patrol and a mummy. The plot starts off with a relatively ordinary story about rival baseball teams, but somewhere along the way it mutates. After Naota whacks his ""dad"" on the head, the plot starts spinning out of control -- climaxing in a psychedelic scene where Naota must bat to save his city... or something like that.

A few questions do get answered in the second volume of ""FLCL (Fooly Cooly)"" -- in particular, we find out why Haruko whacked people with her guitar, and why strange things keep coming out of Naota's head. It doesn't make much more sense, but we still know.

Naota still affects a too-cool-and-mature-to-care attitude, but the strangeness of his life is starting to get to him -- and he's obviously developing an interest in Haruko. And he's increasingly surrounded by troubled girls, including the bossy Ninamori, whose also-too-cool-to-care attitude hides her feelings about her parents' divorce and her father's possible imprisonment. And Haruko... is Haruko. Wild, unpredictable, mildly psycho and strangely fascinating.

The second volume of the mad, mad, mad and colourful ""FLCL (Fooly Cooly)"" only has two episodes, but those episodes are among the strangest in all of anime. Especially the second one. Fooly cooly!",1219276800,,3930,4.9649923896499235
7981309,4,B00008AOSN,"I have to admit that I was a little dumbfounded after watching Volume 1 of FLCL and was debating on whether or not I should view Volume 2. But there was something about it, just some momentary little flashes of brillance that made me push on to this installment. Volume 2 seems to hold back a little on the insanity, or maybe it just seems that way because I've become adjusted to the surreal and crazy format. Anyway, the first of the two episodes on this disk concerns Ninamori, a classmate of Naota, who on the surface, seems to have it all. She's popular, rich, and her dad is the mayor! But beneath it all, her family is breaking up because of her cheating father and in a shojoesque turn, she's not such a good girl as everyone thinks. But maybe her crush on Naota will help her come out of her shell. Or maybe some horrifying alien coming out of her might do the trick!

The second episode is a take-off of baseball, with the alien Haruko opposing the former team of Naota's brother. With her pitching, there's no way any human can even get a hit. Maybe if Naota would lower himself to get some coaching on his swing from Haruko, things would change. That's if Naota doesn't take a swing at his bum of a father first. Imagine the nerve of the old pervert massaging Haruko with the stubble of his beard! On top of that, there's a bomb heading straight at the Earth!

The animation and vivacity of FLCL is just beautiful. It might not make much sense plot-wise, but it's one of the most stimulating anime I have ever seen. The characterization alone is light years beyond what passes for emotion and nuance in other productions. One of the funniest scenes is where a flying Naota, after being ran over by Haruko's Vespa scooter makes a slow motion Matrix bullet time approach to a kiss with Ninamori! The somewhat serious scenes are handled with just as much finesse as the surrealism of the comedy and action. Great experimental show!",1132444800,3,1940,4.477401129943503
7981310,5,B00008AOSN,"This series must get an award for simple originality. None of the characters follow the same anime stereotypes we've come to know as anime fans. The conflict is everchanging but never out of reach. You always know what is going on, in other words. And to add to that, it has a great J-pop soundtrack. If you're tired of those stories about a male Japanese boy surrounded by many beatiful women--and who isn't--this is where to go to regenerate your love for this type of anime.",1128902400,,477,4.558139534883721
7981311,5,B00008AOSN,"It doesn't get much better than this, great animation, all the elements needed to draw in a wide variety of people.  My absolute favorite anime. Just don't come looking for a plot.",1127433600,,180,4.625
7981312,4,B00008AOSN,"Let's start with BRILLIANT, move onto GORGEOUS, a little SHORT AND SWEET, ACTION PACKED... I think talking this series up as ""SO wierd &  out-there"" does it more harm than good.

  So this is the middle, and everyone seems to complain about episode three, but I think it really gives a moment for Naoto (our HERO!) to have an a-l-m-o-s-t healthy relationship with another girl which sort of pays off at the end.  Its a natural break for the final arc set up in episode 4.  No matter what people might say, just pay attention, go with its flow, and FLCL makes perfect sense.  Might make better sense if you don't watch tons of anime actually.  At its heart, its just about growing up and being a man, dammit!

  So my friends turned me on to this a couple of years ago, its the best anime in memory, and reinvigorates my interest in the genre.  Nothing since has touched its perfection.  Short and sweet, spastic as hell, and the dynamics between the characters are bombastic.  Its pretty much a distillation and collage of everything in anime since the 90's hit, a punk-rocking parody that suddenly begins to take itself seriously, then upheaves everything.

  If you take away all the religious underpinnings and focused on Shinji's sexual tension with older/younger women in all twenty-six+ episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but shoved that in only six episodes, and stuck said confused pubescent boy with the ""worst girl for you at the best time"" you've pretty much got the narrative.  Soundtrack by the PILLOWS alone makes it a classic, it rocks like a J-pop PIXIES.

  I give the series itself 5 stars, but the American DVDs just aren't worth the extra cash, so I had to knock it down to 4.  The American dub sucks, the bonuses aren't that great, and you're ending up paying from $75 - $90 for only 2.5 hours of content.  ""Lord of the Rings:Return of the King"" is longer than the whole series combined and costs only $30!  I'm tired of supporting anime companies who finally DO release this stateside only to be jerked around by my wallet.  I could ALMOST understand 2 volumes at that price since the series narrative naturally splits at the middle anyways...  but its still a MUST SEE.

  I recommend getting a used copy if you can't afford the steep tag.
