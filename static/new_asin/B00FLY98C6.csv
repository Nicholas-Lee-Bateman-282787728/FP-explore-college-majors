6014085,5,B00FLY98C6,Sid the Science Kid are all great educational movies that really do teach your kids educational programing in simple ways.  My daughter always learns so much from these and she's 2!  She sings the songs and learns the lesson they are teaching and will act out what she learns in pretend play.  I love these movies and I think anyone looking for a great way to teach educational concepts to young children in an entertaining way should consider these movies.,1417564800,,457,4.6875
6014086,1,B00FLY98C6,"Actually, my children and I love this TV program. That's why we were so disappointed that the rental vanished from our watchlist so quickly. This is especially frustrating, as it is extremely challenging to locate a ""rental period"" anywhere on the page where you actually click ""rent."" Rental Periods should be more clearly displayed on the page where the item is described.",1415404800,,374,5.048387096774194

6014090,5,B00FLY98C6,"From a mom's perspective Sid the Science Kid is one of my favorite educational shows for children. He makes difficult concepts simple in the eyes of a child.

8616759,5,B00FLY98C6,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and just recently found out about Sid the Science Kid. Where have I been? The first episode I watched was the whale episode that discusses non standard measurement. Wow...perfect for classroom use! I love how with each episode, it gives the children (and adults) an easy way to experiment that episode's concept. The concepts are explained in detail on an appropriate level.
