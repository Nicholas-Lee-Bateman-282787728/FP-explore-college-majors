8561821,1,B00B2V65SW,"For quality of sound not content. I don't know if it was a manufacturing error. The volume would go up and down and not audible at times. It was still  interesting to learn about Dr Kandel's life. I watch him on Charlie Rose, the brain series.",1482451200,,243,4.282608695652174
8561822,5,B00B2V65SW,Eric Kandel is an amazing man.  I love that he shows himself to be a human being and not someone who lives in his laboratory,1444262400,,124,3.96
8561823,4,B00B2V65SW,"I read the book of the same name, so I thoroughly enjoyed seeing some of the scenes and scenarios of brain research, particularly the Aplysia sea slug used in the search for memory.",1437264000,,181,4.515151515151516
8561824,5,B00B2V65SW,"This DVD covers several episodes in Eric Kandel's life, from childhood in Austria through the awarding of the Nobel Prize for his research in memory. It personalizes his relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and the students in his laboratory at Columbia University.

Unfortunately, 95 minutes is too brief for the coverage. It will give a brief idea of research in Neurophysiology to students desiring to learn about research in memory. Dr. Kandel gives a tour of his research laboratory. At the end of this clip a new graduate is shown leaving for his first position.

I enjoyed the DVD and think that it makes a good presentation for students interested in this area of science. Guidance counselors should use this DVD for career discussions and exploration.",1427155200,,771,5.111111111111111
8561825,5,B00B2V65SW,"Thank you, Dr. Kandel, for your insights, your brilliance, your humor. I can never share your ability to forgive, but, as this film proclaims, this is another admirable aspect of your vivid personality.",1401321600,,202,5.151515151515151
8561826,5,B00B2V65SW,I used this movie as a starting point for teaching my Asperger/ASD unit about memory.  The students are grades 9-12.  It held their attention all the way!  I highly recommend it for a Psych or Learning Strategies class.,1396137600,,219,4.7105263157894735
8561827,5,B00B2V65SW,"A wonderful informative movie revealing  the science and life and emotions of Nobel prize winner, Eric Kandel, who escaped from Vienna with his parents, at age 9. Will be of interest to students, scientists, historians, academicians etc. To many, it will be a tour de force. While being a social history of the 20th Century and the Holocaust, it is also an intellectual biography of modern neurosciences by a giant of the field, who is also an adroit teacher.",1390089600,3,459,4.810126582278481
8561828,3,B00B2V65SW,"i've been studying neurobiology both at school and in my work and bought the book last summer. first, let me say that i really loved the book but admittedly i skipped through some of the more personal autobiographical stuff that dealt with his early childhood and arguments with his wife about how he was spending too much time at the lab.

so when i saw that there was a dvd version of the book, i immediately got it. unfortunately, i was expecting more of a pbs/nova type of presentation focusing mostly on the great science that's found in the book.  in short, the video does follow the book pretty well but many of the various experiments and other research related accounts of his work just aren't there in the video.

for the most part, i found the book a much more compelling, detailed, and informative read.",1382313600,3,815,4.568493150684931
8561829,5,B00B2V65SW,"This film weaves two stories at the same time, both equally fascinating.  It tells the work and life of Eric Kandel, who has done a life time of groundbreaking work in memory research.  if you want to watch the film, merely to learn the scientific basis of how memory is made; or how long term memory differs from short term memory, then yes, you will learn that in this film.  That is explained very clearly, and with easy to see visual proof from the lab. If you actually want to learn about the life of this man, and what happened to him in vienna as a young jewish boy escaping Nazi Germany, then that story is here also.  The film is 95 min, so there is adequate time to show him as a researcher, and what he has discovered.  And there is time to show him as a remarkable human being, with wit and optimism and sincerity.  I was surprised that he was willing to be so honest, and candid while a camera is rolling as he walks around looking into his own memory of places he visited and experiences.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed an Oliver Sacks book, but wants to go deeper. This is the real deal.  He is the person who began the combination of psychotherapy,  and neuro biology, showing , proving that the brain is actually changing chemically when you learn and when you remember.",1380844800,6,1311,4.340163934426229
