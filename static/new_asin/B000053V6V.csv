7930115,4,B000053V6V,"This is a great video! Unlike the other vidoes about Cassie Bernall, this one is more than just a video tribute. It's a documentary that follows the book of the same title and contains actual interviews with many of the friends mentioned in the book.  The one complaint that I have with the video is that it completely leaves out the religious and spiritual part of the journey. (I believe that this was done to make it more paletable to secular audiences.)
Also, according to the publisher's website, there are supposed to be two different versions of the tape (secular and spiritual) with the only difference being the content of the study guide (the tapes themselves being identicle). The one that I purchased from amazon didn't have EITHER studyguide -- just the tape. If you get the tape, I suggest you go to activeparenting.com and order it directly from the publisher. Their price is $10 dollars more, but it's probably worth it to get the study guide.",994204800,4,959,4.74251497005988
