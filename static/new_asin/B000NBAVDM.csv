8176537,5,B000NBAVDM,"A Battle of Wits brings to the screen the story of a warrior/tactician known for his defensive skills who takes up the task of seeing to the protection of a city faced with superior enemy forces.
It's 370 BC and China finds itself in the Warring States Period a.k.a. the Era of Warring States (5th-3rd Centuries BC).  Seven major kingdoms and various smaller players are vying for control and power.  The city-state of Liang is about to be overrun by the overwhelming forces of the kingdom of Zhao, who in turn are on their way to wage war on the kingdom of Yan in China's Northeast.  The city's only hope lies in the arrival of a military contingent from the Mo-Tsu.  However, when only man arrives morale begins to falter.  The plot thickens, as things are not what they seem in 4th Century BC China...
The film combines fantasy, romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!
Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.
The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.
Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.
Needless to say, the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!
Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.
Strongly recommended along with Seven Swords, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The House of Flying Daggers, The Promise, and Hero, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.",1187395200,,1921,4.928792569659443
8176538,5,B000NBAVDM,"This is a must see movie. It is Chinese verion of ""Troy"" plus ""kingdom of Heaven"" with story and acting as good as ""Gladiator"". It is like combining 3 great movies in one. I watched it over and over again and never feel bored. Should be a 6 stars movie. Buy it now, man. (Of course, you will need to have some background of ancient Chinese history in order to appreciate it fully. I do not expect the general American who is ignorant on Ancient Chinese history would be able to even understand the movie.)",1177200000,,505,4.326315789473684
