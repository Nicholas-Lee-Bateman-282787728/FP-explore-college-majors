8409518,5,B000ADS68A,"I bought volume two of Ernie Hawkins instruction for Mance quite a while back now and later bought volume one. Of the two, volume one is probably my pick but this second is good also. All songs allow for building variations into them so respecting the original but creating your own effect or ""continuing the folk process"" as Hawkins himself observed when referring to one of his great renditions on The Artistry Of Ernie Hawkins DVD. Hawkins teaches well on this volume 2 of Mance and a bonus is of some good footage of Lipscomb in concert from the 1960s.",1315958400,,556,4.57
