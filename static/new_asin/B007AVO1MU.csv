5072997,2,B007AVO1MU,"I like these videos for the most part, but there are some words in them that we do not let our kids say.  They say the word ""stupid"" quite a bit and there are several put-downs in the movies.  I did not appreciate the comments that Davey and his sister Sally make to each other.  Even though this makes them more like a real brother and sister, I think they should be setting a better example for kids.  My kids liked them at first because they were new, but now they don't even chose to watch them.  I think its a waste of money to buy the whole set.",1398729600,2,551,4.018348623853211
5072998,5,B007AVO1MU,Watched this show as a child.  I bought two sets for nieces and nephews.  There is not much wholesome TV shows for children these days.  I know they are going to love this show and learn good lessons about life and love as well. Thanks,1397779200,4,235,4.177777777777778
5072999,5,B007AVO1MU,We love Davy and Goliath. Good moral values and there is a traditional intact family you just don't see as often as you used to.,1394323200,4,128,4.16
5073000,5,B007AVO1MU,I watched this on TV and bought all the series. Loved when my son was little and watched on TV,1390089600,3,94,3.75
5073001,5,B007AVO1MU,"What can I say?  If you grew up watching this on public access a kid (like I did) when there were limited channel selections, and later as a twenty something watching these on the couch Sunday mornings after late night Saturday's, you'll appreciate these.  Being in ministry now, I think they are wonderful and highly recommend the content and format.  Get this for your kids, and you might find yourself watching along side them.  Not so ""busy"" as modern productions targeted at kids, and yet interest grabbing and relevant. IMHO",1389571200,20,530,4.855555555555555
5073002,5,B007AVO1MU,I was happy to see they put these on DVD ..most of us forgot about these.. next is Gumby and Pokey  !!,1381795200,2,102,3.6363636363636362
5073003,4,B007AVO1MU,"Bought these for my 7 year old son, because my husband and I remembered watching Davey and Goliath when we were kids.  We like that they have good morals, even though we have noticed that Davey is pretty bratty in a lot of the episodes, he always learns his lesson, and they mention God a lot, and even pray in the episodes.  We love Goliath's comic relief, like when he says ""if he calls me Bow wow Goliath one more time, I'll bite him."". or when Davey says ""hot dog!"", and Goliath says, ""Oh Davey, don't say that!""  Makes us laugh every time.  I would recommend for kiddos whose parents are trying to keep them a little more innocent than our society lets them be. 4 outta 5 stars.",1373760000,22,683,4.271317829457364
5073004,5,B007AVO1MU,Great show for kids and kids at heart! This is a great cartoon to help kids learn values which are so rarely taught to kids anymore.,1371340800,5,132,4.115384615384615
5073005,5,B007AVO1MU,"this item is great the box its self was a little weak but is ok because the dvds are the ones i really care about i have done all of my looking around and read about this item from alot of sites this is the complete tv show from the 1960's every show is on here and the missing ep,and the special ep as well..and so far amazon has the lower price for it from where i been looking so if you ever thought about getting this i say you have nothing to lose these are great",1369267200,17,468,3.8350515463917527
5073006,4,B007AVO1MU,"I got these for my grandson because I remember watching them when I was little.  Although the stories are still as great as ever, the technology that kids are used to today is so superior that I think they might get a little bit bored, simply because they are so used to today's technology.  But if the kids are very small, and don't know the difference between the technology of ""then"" and the technology of ""now"" yet, then it's great.  My grandson was 5 when I gave this to him, and by that time he already had his own Ipad, was learning beginning programming, and also learning to build robots from his father, so this was a bit ""back there"" for him, but of course these BIBLICAL stories will never be outdated.  So the 4 stars are ONLY because of the older technology, but that's OK.  It just is what it is, and this is in NO WAY the fault of the seller.  I just want to make that clear.  The seller was great and did everything right:):)",1469664000,2,942,4.258426966292135
5073007,5,B007AVO1MU,"I purchased this set and now have two sets of Davey and Goliath. I loved these shows as a child and still to this day. This is a very nice show if you want to hear about God. I can not say anything negative of this show. It has all sorts of lessons learned in each episode. It can help young people to learn how to act in todays world.

If you are looking for something to have for your young children to watch and not have to worry about the content, then this is one that is very safe. It is one of the better choices for all ages and no language issues ever. This show takes one back to a simpler time and place for children, which is a shame that this is not true for today.

This is filled with some very funny ordeals that make you laugh, and is also with the serious stuff that makes you think of action and consequences.

I would highly recommend this to any person looking at this, you just can't go wrong. This could make a nice gift for anyone looking for something for all ages.",1463184000,2,990,4.040816326530612

5073010,5,B007AVO1MU,I grew up watching Davey and Goliath and had to purchase these when I saw them on Amazon.  It is so enjoyable to watch them.  I am disappointed that some of the episodes were edited to conform to the current PC culture.  You cannot change history by pretending certain attitudes were not prevalent at one time.,1452038400,3,310,4.5

5073016,5,B007AVO1MU,"Each story reminds me how God is involved in our daily activities, how many lessons are in front of my nose and how easy they are to miss. Davey And Goliath provides snapshots of relationships and family interaction as a model to work toward in our own family. Has a charming relationship between a boy and his dog, Goliath.

5073023,3,B007AVO1MU,"I personally think that a complete collection should not be censored as to content.  There is much said about this in the ""lost episodes"" reviews.  I am glad to have what is in this collection, but wish that it was actually the full historical programs, not changed to be PC for current standards.  If I wanted Veggie Tales I would have ordered them.",1435622400,24,350,4.523809523809524

the ""moral purity"" of the show and ""high moral values"", which are hard to find in cartoons made today.  She looks forward to watching this when she visits often. It teaches such respect to adults and honor to parents and grandparents.  It keeps her interest throughout the cartoon.",1429315200,2,420,4.5

We bought this to watch with our grand kids, they love it.  One of the first things that they do when they come over is ask if the can watch Davey.  The great thing about this collection is it is comprehensive- all of the episodes and special are here.

5073034,3,B007AVO1MU,"Love the series.

Quality of the CD is poor.

I have take care not to let the get absused in anyway but despite my most careful efforts the CDs play poorly

I have no problem playing other DVDs so it is exclusive just to this set.

My advice play 4 discs at random if you see any problems immediately ask for a new set or return for a refund.

I cant do that because i just assumed it would play so i let them sit for a good while until my daughter was old enough to understand what was going on.

8513642,5,B007AVO1MU,"This is the ultimate release (if not the only?) of this good old series. The picture quality is the best possible transfer for the films, without mega extra expensive refining. The sound is (more noticable with headphones) in a psuedo-stereo effect. Also somewhat muffled here & there and could have been re-equalized. But considering the expense for those types of enhancements, both picture & sound are good if not better than they looked & sounded on tv broadcasts. Clokey Production fans will also be relieved (& happy) that the original soundtracks -- including the voices, sound FX & classic John Seely / Capitol Production Music cues -- are here.
As for the content of the stories & everything else, they obviously are from the 1950s & 60s ""suburban Christian family"" ideals & morals. Those settings in real life (seem to) have deteriorated, but the Gospel teachings are timeless & universal for those who want to be open minded and teachable. All in all, a great re-release of a nice old series.",1524268800,4,1003,4.871345029239766
