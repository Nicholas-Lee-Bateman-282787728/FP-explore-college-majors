8046866,5,B0007D26AC,"I had been searching for this movie for a long time.  When I finally found it, I was quite certain that it would be in poor condition however, to my delight, the movie came in perfect order (brand new).  Excellent service.
As for the movie itself, if you haven't seen it, give it a try.  If you are a fan of gritty action with an engaging plot and unlikely heroes (plural), then this is definitely your thriller.  This movie is a French movie without any particularly American known French actors which should make the connection with the characters even more palpable.  The pace starts of light and humorous with a lot of bonding and then the twists start to come at you at a feverish pace when three different parties find themselves in a wild confrontation.  I know this doesn't tell much about the movie, that's why you should see it : )
NOTE:  I only found two versions of the movie.  One in French without subtitles and the other with Spanish subtitles.  Just an FYI.

Sincerely,
DG (Pekuvi)",1244592000,,997,4.5195530726256985
