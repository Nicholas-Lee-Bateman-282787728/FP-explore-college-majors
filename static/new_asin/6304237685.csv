820963,4,6304237685,"This is a novelty: A musical film from 1945 that contains alcoholism, poverty and  adultery. Of course it`s Sonja`s show and she carries it of beautifully, though her dramatic depth as an actress might be questioned hehehe. The photography by the great Ray Rennahan is spectacular, as are the scenic  design and costumes. Marie ""The Body""(as she was called) McDonald is a breathtaking witch. McDonald suffered from too many ex-husbands and eventually committed suicide by the early 60s... Sonja`s solos are the best she did on celluloid(with Iceland 1942) and her dance-scene without skates proved that she was an excellent dancer. What a pity she never was teamed with Fred Astaire; it could have been an interesting musical....",1089676800,7,729,5.169491525423729

821115,5,6304237685,"This is perhaps Sonja Henie's best film. not as much ""fluff"" that her other films has, covers many topics you don't think of with her films. Her onlyt film in color, she's head over heals for an ice hockey player that gets kicked out when his temper flared up one time too many. She gets him a job with a show, There is another woman, already married, who wants him just as much, and that's where it gets interesting. A fine cast also helps in making this story as good as it is. Any other cast wouldn't do. Sonie's other great film.not yet on DVD. is Sun Valley Serenade. bUt if enjoy her talents on the ice, this film is for you.",1409788800,,631,4.180327868852459

821122,2,6304237685,"I've seen most of Sonja Henie's movies and often they have very clever plots and are well done.  So why, out of all of her movies, this one is on DVD is beyond me.  Yes, it is one of the few that is in color, but it features one of the worst plots I've seen her movies have.  She's a doormat to an alcoholic no good husband.  We are expected to believe that she has a positive effect on him, but there is never a real reason for her to be so madly in love with him.  She ""mothers"" him, which they tout in the film, but it seems ridiculous given that most wild men don't want to be Mothered. And the ""other"" woman is quite evil, though not for any clear cut reason.  Other than she doesn't want anybody else to be happy.  Which is realistic, but a drag in this film.  Furthermore, while Sonja has a charming smile, her ice skating is awkward with broken lines and hunched over shoulders.  While a worldwide champion in the art/sport multiple times back in her day, nowadays her skating leaves much to desire.  I recommend several of her other films, but this one is a waste of time.",1317340800,2,1081,4.178743961352657
821203,5,6304237685,"I have been waiting for Sun Valley movie of Sonja Henie and thought I would try another. I have enjoyed ""It's a pleasure"", over and over. I highly recommend it to Henie fans. I watched this champion growing up on Black and White  televison, and now in color is like a reward. She is beautiful, natural, and competitive. That is what makes so many people like her. She was never ready to give up. She had a wonderful life. I am looking forward to many more of her films. Thanks, Amazon. Mary C.",1300147200,,493,4.301075268817204
821204,5,6304237685,"Sonia Henie the way people remember her. The ice skating is great and the acting is classic. They do not make movies like this anymore. My mother loved it, because she saw it years ago growing up.",1293580800,,196,4.324324324324325
821205,3,6304237685,I was pleased to find this old movie for my 85 yr. old mother. She was a big fan of Sonia Henie. We were alittle disappointed that it didn't show more of her skating abilities in it. It was more story than it was skating.,1264636800,,221,3.933333333333333
821206,5,6304237685,"Lovely old movie in color, the skating on the black mirror rink is surperb, even by today's standards of filming. I thoroughly enjoying watching Sonja Henie's skating, she was a champion for her time. Thanks for putting it on DVD for us more mature people to enjoy.",1248912000,2,265,4.659574468085107
821207,3,6304237685,"A very minor movie to be sure, but noteworthy for Sonja Henie fans, because it's the only film she did in Technicolor.  It was also sadly one of her last movies.  In IT'S A PLEASURE, Henie co-stars with affable Michael O'Shea and the scene-stealing Iris Adrian.

Sonja Henie stars as Chris Linden, a talented skater who falls in love with Don Martin (Michael O'Shea), a drunken hockey player who gets disqualified from the sport after he beats up the referee.  It's a standard ""Star is Born"" story but given lots of life thanks to Henie and O'Shea's winning chemistry.  Musical theatre singer Bill Johnson (as the ice-troupe manager) and Marie McDonald (his coldly-manipulative wife) are also impressive.

Sonja Henie, always so youthful and innocent in her early vehicles like ""Second Fiddle"" and ""Sun Valley Serenade"" is allowed to show a more mature, dramatic side to her personality in this movie.  Three years later she'd appear in her final movie (""The Countess of Monte Cristo"") before going into semi-retirement.

One for the Sonja fans.",1243814400,5,1045,5.0

(RKO, 1945)
-------------------------------
This is an unusually robust, earthy film for Norwegian skating sensation Sonia Henie... Her other films tended to be pretty goodie-two-shoesy, but this late WWII flick has a pretty salty script, apparently influenced by the hard-bitten film noir genre of the time. Here, Henie is a hardworking professional figure skater who falls for a hard-drinking, roughneck hockey player whose bad temper and alcoholism gets him banned from the sport (played by Michael O'Shea).  He in turn is pursued by the trampy, sexually aggressive wife of one of his best friends, who plies him with booze and (apparently) leads him astray. The dialogue is full of both implied and surprisingly direct rawness -- hardly the family-friendly fare of Henie's earlier films. All in all, pretty entertaining!  You might be surprised at how racy the plot is... the skating's pretty fine, too!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1241308800,18,962,5.357615894039735

821211,2,6304237685,This is the first Sonja Henie picture released on DVD (and her only one in Technicolor). It is not from her best period but the beautiful Technicolor and her skating and dancing scenes more than make up for it. Iris Adrian adds to the fun.,1239148800,8,239,4.333333333333333
821212,4,6304237685,"Lent ongoing allure by the extraordinary early Technicolor process, this ice-skating romance also benefits from contributions by several Oscar-winning technicians, all in top form here, including cinematographer Ray Rennahan (Gone With the Wind), interior designer Wiard Ihnen, and set decorator Julia Heron. Additionally, those responsible for the superlative costumes and hair styling should be recognized, with all of these crew strengths nearly making the plot irrelevant, as a viewer is dazzled in one way or another and, of course, often by the skating of Sonja Henie. For precision skating, Henie has never been topped, and here her known acting shortcomings seem less obtrusive than is usual, as she is supported by a solid cast, including Michael O'Shea, Gus Schilling, Iris Adrian, and a startlingly beautiful Marie McDonald, whose agenda to steal O'Shea from Henie comprises the core of a somewhat melodramatic and simplistic screen play. The script turns upon Henie's love for O'Shea, who plays a professional hockey player is permanently banned for punching an official, and whose fondness for alcohol leads to a variety of thorny situations which turn his life upside down, and which link him with the difficult to ignore McDonald. All involved in this effort are served well by journeyman director William A. Seiter, who takes charge of the action whenever the scenario flags, although the editing and blocking are at times obtrusive. It all comes down in the end to Henie on ice, and there the pirouetting dervish provides as usual, with her at times off-putting Norwegian inflections not an issue, skating as well as ever and benefiting, as throughout the film, including one non-gelid partnered dance scene, from a lovely score composed by Walter Donaldson and Edgar Leslie.",1106870400,5,1792,5.313380281690141

7866204,1,6304237685,"The movie ""Executive Suite"" was a good movie with good stars about  CORPORATE INTRIGUE.  How did Sonje Henie get in a communist slant on immoral executives?  Drawn in by the promise of seeing Sonje Henie  in COLOR! we get a melodrama about an ice skater doing half time shows at a hockey game  ( taken from Happy Landing) to being married to a drunken brawling hockey player and the mean immoral executive who manipulates her.  It does have 4 watchable ice skating skits but none of the joyful fantasy of her previous films.
As a desperate fan of hers the second time Iwatched it I just fast forwarded it to just the dance sequences(one sequence was not on skates like ""Wintertime""",1448409600,,681,4.586776859504132
