1735702,5,B00006ADEX,"This turned out to be a very enjoyable movie. The actress who played the role of Margo Winchester,Raven De La Croix actually

made this movie.

  A German(Nazi) type person is killed after someone slips a

pirana into his bathtub. Undercover agent Margo Winchester makes

her entrance by jogging down the highway. She is nearly raped and killed by one of the locals. She soon gains the confidence of the locals and begins investigating the murder. There is also a good

action scene involving an Indian maiden. The true murderer is

finally revealed after our hero Margo Winchester is stabbed. Her

and the murderer have a nude battle all over the countryside. She

turns out to be a Los Angeles Police Detective. A very good movie

on the Russ Meyer scale. I only wish the Raven De La Croix had made more movies.",1091664000,12,813,4.654929577464789
1735731,3,B00006ADEX,Very interesting introduction to the work of Russ Meyer.  His personal obsessions are quite evident in the movie.  Erotic sequences fit well into the given context.,1359244800,,164,5.269230769230769
1735732,3,B00006ADEX,I bought this film to be able to see another film that features the late great Robert McLane (Robert Joel). The irony is that he is a gay actor playing in a very active straight role. The women are beautiful too. The interview with the star is great. She still looks great after 35 years! Thanks for making it available.,1355529600,,320,4.35
1735733,3,B00006ADEX,"Up! tells the tale of Adolph Schwartz (Edward Shaaf), who looks a little like another well known Adolf, who has been murdered in his American castle. His death was caused by a piranha dropped into his bath....but who is the culprit? Was it The Ethopian Chef (Elaine Collins), The Headsperson (Mary Gavin aka Candy Samples), the lovely Limehouse (Su Ling), or could it have possibly been Leonard Box (Larry Dean), or maybe blow-in Margo Winchester (Raven De La Croix), whose antics with the local men seem to be taking all the attention away from his murder, or could it have been one of the many other strange characters who dwell in the town. Who knows, but with the help of the pneumatic Greek Chorus (Kitten Natividad), we will find the answer...

For all that the plot is quickly dispensed with in order to present the usual Meyer film experience. Big breasted women running often naked through the countryside. While the formula is much the same, Meyer takes it to the limit in this film. Along with the usual nudity there is a good deal of violence which makes Up! less fun than many of Meyer's earlier films. In fact there is something disturbing about the film that is rather difficult to get a handle on. Make no mistake the women are beautiful and the over the top performances by De La Croix and Natividad alone make this film inherently watchable but don't go looking for great story telling here or even a plot that makes a great deal of sense.

There are two decent extras on this disc. The first is Pussy Galore Night: Interview with Kitten Natividad (12 minutes 10 seconds) and No Fairy Tale...This!: Interview with Raven De La Croix (18 minutes and 4 seconds). Both interviews are interesting looks into Russ Meyer's world, both cinematically and personally. As usual these productions have some wonderful tales that are associated with them, and both these women have some interesting stories to tell.

Rent  it before you buy as this is one of the director's weaker efforts.",1336694400,2,1993,4.734870317002882
1735734,2,B00006ADEX,"Outrageously gratuitous and excessive in every sense of the word, Russ Meyer's Up! cleverly mixes busty babes, bloody violence, blouse-busting femme fatales, and well-endowed vixens into an erotic comedy of epic proportions. The fact that the plot is a murder-mystery that no one cares to solve, a narration by Kitten Natividad is bursting with Shakespearean poetry explaining characters no one cares to profile, and unimportant timeframe titles keep popping up as each scene starts hardly matters; anyone watching Up! is clearly in it for the over-the-top exploitation and generous doses of female nudity.

Kitten Natividad is the Greek Chorus, a naked narrator who excitedly details the wide assortment of characters who frequent the various story lines. Frequently she'll recap events with slightly different clips of footage and plenty of elaborate, riddle-filled, lyrical observations. Adolf Schwartz (Edward Schaaf), a depraved Nazi warlock and S&M fetishist, is brutally murdered in his bubblebath with the deadly fish Harry the Nimrod. There are many suspects, courteously announced by Kitten, but little motive and fewer complaints. It's a baffling puzzle with only the clue of a black-leather-gloved culprit.

Meanwhile, Margo Winchester (Raven De La Croix) is viciously attacked during a morning jog, and winds up accidentally killing her rapist. When the entire event is witnessed by local policeman Homer Johnson (Monty Bane), he coerces her into a few sexual favors to overlook the killing. Later, she gets work selling hotdogs at Sweet Li'l Alice's (Janet Wood) Cafe; in short order she's also ""romantically"" involved with Alice's husband Paul (Robert McLane).

As with most of Russ Meyer's X-rated voluptuous hellcat extravaganzas, the extreme sexual violence, overflowing testosterone and copious mounts of salacious nudity is done in such a jaunty manner that it's undeniably humorous. It's campy, pornographic, and wallowing in a sea of carnality, but effective in its mission of unrefined eroticism and gung ho extravagance. When Alice and Margot discover their bridled, steamy bisexuality when consoling each other with a sensual hug seconds after barely escaping a traumatizing sexual incursion, it's obvious that the whole ordeal is a well-planned setup for a spicy, fleshly girls-only encounter.

The film opens with ludicrously happy music, changing over to dramatic, orchestral, country, classic rock, patriotic, swashbuckling and everything in-between, even delivering wittily-placed Beethoven. Painfully bad dubbing and poor sound effects round out notable technical aspects, although it's almost unfair to critique how the movie was made considering the reason for its creation. With a creative zipper-cam shot, oodles of random sex, a crazed ax-wielding lumberjack, bondage, lesbianism, constantly unsheathed bosoms, bottomless ecstasy and overload of chesty pulchritudinous and lots of unnecessary explanations and dialogue during the lengthy birthday-suit final chase sequence, Russ Meyer's Up! should definitely not be confused with Pixar's latest computer animated family film.

1735735,3,B00006ADEX,"The film begins quite mysteriously in a dungeon where a young man is torturing an Adolf Hitler look-alike... We then quickly cut to a stunning nude, played by Kitten Natividad, who teasingly introduces the audience to the setting...

We are in Northern California, in a small, rural community... Just outside of town, a very beautiful, buxom young lady is hitchhiking along a lonely country road... She is picked up by a young man, who happens to be the infant terrible of the local rich set... He tries to take advantage of the girl's abundant sexuality but after a short sequence involving a brutal rape, she turns the tables and ends up killing him...

Russ Meyer has never been one to linger too long on a single shot... He likes to cut, especially to ladies running naked as jaybirds around the lush countryside... In this case, however, he has added more than just a tease with Kitten Natividad, who narrates the events of the story with a husky, British accent while displaying her terrific figure... The true star of the show, however, is Raven de la Croix, whose piercing dark eyes and fully rounded, voluptuous figure combine with some firmly loyal acting for an explosive performance...",1232236800,6,1197,4.8341463414634145
1735736,4,B00006ADEX,"Meyer's films seemed to get more and more bizarre near the end of his directing career.  Up! is definitely his wildest in terms of both sex and violence.  Like with most of Meyer's films, there is a plot to follow, but it's not much to talk about and only serves as a reason to string endless sex scenes together.  Plotwise, it has Raven De La Croix drifting into a small town and getting involved with the sexcapades of a local married couple who own a diner.  That's the plot in the most basic of terms, but throw in a horny sheriff, an insane juggernaut lumberjack, a Hitler wannabe, and a killer on the loose, and you've got the recipe for a crazy ride.  The killer wears black gloves, making it almost seem like a Russ Meyer ""stab"" at a giallo!  Speaking of a killer, this film is probably Meyer's most violent.  He'd usually throw in dashes of violence in previous films(the murder in Supervixens is kinda shocking and unexpected in it's brutality), but here he's upping(no pun intended)the ante a bit, even including a chainsaw murder.  There are two brutal rape scenes that are rather unpleasant.  All rape scenes are unpleasant, but there's something especially disturbing about zany cartoon sound effects being used during them.  This may put off some folks, even those who usually enjoy Meyer's movies.  Then of course there's the sex.  As in Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens, Meyer makes it his mission not to let 5 minutes of screen time pass without nudity and/or sex.  You're bombarded with so many images of beautiful female anatomy that you almost become desensitized, if such a thing is possible!  The sex in Up! is about as dirty and graphic as the law will allow without being a full fledged porno film, so don't watch it with the kiddies.  The sex is also a bit more extreme than in previous Meyer films.  Meyer was an old fashioned kinda guy when it came to sex, he liked no ""freaky"" stuff.  Here he delves into S&M, oral sex and even a scene with two men!  New territory for Russ.  The long rubber male appendages used to a humorous, yet restrained degree in Supervixens are all over the place here, probably to make the male viewer feel inadequate.  Once again, Russ shows us that he can photograph the female body like no one else.  Kitten Natividad is the narrator who's nude the entire film, and looks stunning.  Raven De La Croix(a long time obsession of Meyer's) isn't the most attractive woman, but you certainly can't take your eyes off the woman's body.  Many more yummy woman are in and out of the film, but these two woman you will go away remembering.  Even with all of it's excessiveness, Up! is a very entertaining and funny film is you don't take any of what you're seeing seriously.  Well, I don't see how you could considering the whole thing is just too silly.  It's a must for Meyer fans, and certainly recommended for trashy sex/exploitation/cult film lovers.

1735737,4,B00006ADEX,"Doesn't make a lick of sense and isn't titallating but it's quite amusing. As usual ther's some innovative photography and ridiculously large body parts. If you're a Russ fan, you'll want to see this.",1176681600,,200,4.911764705882353

1735739,5,B00006ADEX,"I can contrast UP! with Jurgen Syberberg's film, ""Our Hitler,"" a numbing film of some 9 hours which states that Hitler was guilty, Germany was guilty, and everyone was guilty. So no one is guilty! Hitler walks as a result of this tedious, boring film that puts the viewer in a trance.

Meyer, on the other hand, gets rid of Hitler so fast with a piranha fish in his bathtub. And the movie is good anti-fascist soft porn! It does make fun of Nazis, and I recommend this film as an antidote to Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will."" Obviously, Riefenstahl's movie is a work of evil art. But Meyer, in a strange way, does make fun of it.

Oddly enough, Meyer's films have been a hit in the Western zone of Germany, formerly the region of the nation that had embraced Hitler.

The movie has qualities of melodrama and subtle political messages.

Strongly recommended as an antidote to fascism and the morality of the right wing.

1735740,3,B00006ADEX,"The first 45 minutes are fine.  I loved the frenzied cartoonish ""Tom & Jerry"" pace, but after a while it started to wear on me.  Maybe if I'd found just one of the women attractive it'd be a different story but as it was I couldn't wait for the end.  Mainly it was the amount of dialogue.  The script has got to be as thick as a novel.  Words shooting out of people's mouths so fast I finally gave up trying to listen.

The story, which is completely unimportant concerns the murder of Adolph Hitler who now lives, until recently, in a small town in America.  The suspects are a bunch of locals who all have overgrown sex organs and do nothing but bang and run (literally) around 24 hours a day.  There had to be grocery bags of drugs consumed while filming this movie.

I could go into the story deeper, but who really cares?  The non-stop sex scenes are not stimulating in the least.  I felt numb by the end of the movie.  There is nothing erotic.  No seduction.  No foreplay.  Just bang, bang, bang!  Like machinery.  Jane March holding hands in THE LOVER was more erotic than anything in this movie.

7966045,4,B00006ADEX,"Here is one of Russ Meyer's last and raunchiest movies, from the 1970s.

7966050,5,B00006ADEX,"This 1976 movie was co-written, produced, and directed by Russ Meyer. It's the middle of Meyer's masterpieces, preceded by ""SuperVixens"" (1975), and followed by ""Beneath The Valley Of The Ultra-Vixens"" (1979).  The movie starts with Adolph Schwartz (Edward Schaaf), an old German guy who looks like Adolph Hitler, being killed, when a hungry piranha is dropped into his bathtub.  Early in the action, the legendary Candy Samples briefly appears as the Headsperson.  Later, the breathtakingly beautiful Margo Winchester (Raven De La Croix) hitch-hikes into town, gets a job at the local diner, and becomes romantically involved with the sheriff.  Since Charles Napier had moved on to mainstream movies, Sheriff Homer Johnson is played by Monte Bane.  To help keep track of the plot, we have the Greek Chorus, in the form of a naked Kitten Natividad. However, it's not Kitten's voice doing the narration.  Near the end of the movie, Margo discovers who the murderer is.  However, that's not that important, since this movie is more of a who-did-who than a whodunit!",1405468800,,1063,5.145348837209302
7966051,4,B00006ADEX,"If you like Russ Meyer, then you will probably also enjoy this installment of Meyers continuous farce of sex and violence. However, for those who enjoy films with a little more ""restraint"" in the plot and story, you will probably be disappointed.
There are some nice extras with this DVD. An interview with  Raven de la Croix is actually quite entertaining.",1394582400,,357,4.852459016393443
7966052,2,B00006ADEX,"Another reviewer described ""Up!"" as a hateful film, and I have to say that that's a fair assessment. It's hard to describe a movie that features three rapes (all of which are uncomfortable to watch, one of which is brutal enough that it actually made me turn away from the screen), gay male bondage sex (call me a closed-minded prude if you want, but I'm a heterosexual male and I don't have any interest in seeing sex between men in my entertainment--particularly sado-masochism) and a hell of a lot of ugly violence in any other way.

I haven't seen all of Meyer's films but I am familiar with his work, and ""Up!"" is considered his most ""extreme"" movie. All of them are pretty extreme--that's an earmark of Meyer's work--but ""Up!"" is ugly. Sleazy even.

Meyer's movies also don't make a lot of sense, and that's true of ""Up!"" as much as any. Basically it's a murder mystery, although the plot thread is so thin that it gets lost in all of the insanity. Who killed Adolf Schwartz (using a maneating fish)? With all of these naked women around, the better question is, who cares?

But Meyer fails to deliver on the thing that his movies are known for most, which are huge breasts. Of the Meyer movies that I've seen, this one features the smallest breasts by far, with only leading lady Raven De La Croix making a consistent major impact (even Kitten Natividad, featured here in her first Meyer role, is smaller-busted than she was for the later ""Beyond the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens""...a much better film). Worse is that in this 1976 caper the women had started turning more toward silicone enhancement. I miss the all-natural wonders of Uschi Digard.

There is a gluttonous amount of full-frontal female nudity here (never a bad thing); I would be hard-pressed to name another full-length feature with more. So that at least held my attention, but it was tough for awhile.

Two stars may be a little harsh of me--I battled between two and three. But in the end the brutality and cruelty are just  too much, and the giant rubber phalluses appear far too often.",1383350400,,2062,4.635616438356164
