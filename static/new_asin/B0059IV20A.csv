4620907,5,B0059IV20A,I read about this DVD on a few mommy blogs and found the trailer on YouTube [...].  It looks adorable and I can't wait for my pre-ordered copy to arrive!,1313107200,,153,4.1
4620908,5,B0059IV20A,Toddlers within my care can't get enough of this musical DVD! I play it every morning...dancing/singing...having fun! Exercise their hearts...motor skills!,1398384000,,155,6.428571428571429
4620909,1,B0059IV20A,it's very bad. voice and picture not clear .It is not worth even a $1. I don't recommend this to any one .,1395878400,,106,3.652173913043478
4620910,4,B0059IV20A,Im not thrilled with this DVD but the kids (5 yrs and 18 mos) seem to enjoy it. I do love the song choices because those are my little ones favorites. Its great that they have kids singing the songs but I also wish they would sing through a verse with an adult or mature kid as well for sometimes I worry my beginner speaker isn't understanding it clearly. Would I repurchase if the disc broke? No. But! The kids always get up and dance and become active when I put it in and thats the important part.,1394841600,,501,4.122448979591836
4620911,5,B0059IV20A,"Finally, a video that stars real toddlers, acting like toddlers. The songs are all old favorites, and there is plenty of repetition, so my little boys have learned them and can sing along. The combination of animation and live action makes this a really fun movie.",1392940800,2,264,4.760869565217392
4620912,2,B0059IV20A,It seemed kind of short and of poor quality. I played it and my child wasn't in the least interested with this one and I haven't played it again.,1392681600,,145,4.0344827586206895
4620913,5,B0059IV20A,As his favorite song is 'Old McDonald'  I didn't know if he would like this version or not but he loves it and loves the faster beat and music.  He dances in his carseat and claps his hands.  Highly reccomend for the 2 yr olds and up.,1388361600,3,234,3.9361702127659575
4620914,5,B0059IV20A,I have a home daycare and the kids absolutely love this video!! It is cute and they are learning how to count and their abc's from this! I have purchased one for all of them for Christmas gifts :) You will not be disappointed!!,1379980800,2,227,4.181818181818182
4620915,5,B0059IV20A,My 18 mo old is obsessed with this video. She always asks to watch this DVD or play the CD when she's in her room playing. She can do all the gestures to wheels on the bus. I think she likes the songs and the fact that it has real kids on it. I like that it's not a fast paced cartoon and is only 30 minutes so I have to worry about her watching tv for too long.,1373068800,3,362,3.5949367088607596
4620916,5,B0059IV20A,Grandson is very interested in DVD's and this was has a calming effect.  He enjoys walking around while it is playing.  Play and watch and eat is the rule of the game.,1363392000,,167,4.1875
4620917,5,B0059IV20A,She loves all the songs and I remember all of them from when I was young and love that she is learning them.,1363132800,,108,3.739130434782609
4620918,5,B0059IV20A,"My 18 month old makes me put this on over and over. She loves dancing and watching the children and ""teapot"". Its perfect for little toddlers.",1361318400,3,142,4.5

4620920,5,B0059IV20A,I bought this for my 30mo old little girl who has Down Syndrome and she absolutely loves it and sings the songs!  Love this DVD.  It's a nice change from many of the other educational DVD's out there..  would recommend it to add to any toddler collection.,1359072000,,255,4.382978723404255
4620921,3,B0059IV20A,I think my toddler watched this DVD once when we got it. I don't think she liked it (probably because it wasn't Barney.) But we do listen to a few tracks from the cd in the car often. She loves the wheels on the bus and old McDonald!,1358553600,,233,3.875
4620922,5,B0059IV20A,I have a home daycare and all 5 of my toddlers absolutely love this DVD.  I have to find more like it.  It's great.  Better than a CD because they can visualize what they are learning to sing.,1354752000,,192,4.0
4620923,5,B0059IV20A,"My 26 month old Grandson has so much fun when he is watching this dvd.  It is his favorite right now and he watches it over and over.  He smiles and laughs along with the kids in the dvd.  Everytime ring around the rosey comes on, we have to get up and play it too.  He really gets into this dvd and participates in all the activities along with the children on the dvd.  This is a great dvd for the price.",1348185600,2,406,3.902439024390244
4620924,1,B0059IV20A,The graphics were of poor quality. There were times the words didn't match the singers' lips. My son LOVES music but does not like this product. Some of it is ear wrenching to listen to.,1342137600,,186,4.3428571428571425
4620925,5,B0059IV20A,My daughter is completely in love with it. It is a great DVD. Wish there were more of the same series.,1341964800,,102,3.9047619047619047
4620926,5,B0059IV20A,"I work part-time in a children's library, and I borrowed this CD and DVD combo for my grandaughter who is 18 months old. She loved watching the DVD and we listened to the CD in the car. She enjoyed it so much that I purchsed it for home. The songs are all ones that toddlers will know, and it is all children performing the songs. She would watch it all day over and over if I let her. Definitly worth purchasing and great value for the money . .",1333584000,,446,4.022471910112359

8462995,5,B0059IV20A,"OMG!! my grandson (2 years old) can't get enough!!  regular cartoons just do not catch his attention. videos that he loves are the 3D claymation type like this one. all other cartoons and kid shows and movies  ,,,,,, I swear he has ADHD!!  LOL... but seriously, he will sit and be quiet with his blankie and watch this all day and get up for a snack and he is back on the chair watching this... OH>>> and he gets up and dance with them...",1511654400,,438,4.190476190476191
8462996,4,B0059IV20A,"Cute DVD with lots of singing. Video is poor quality but still, my great-granddaughter loves watching it. She is no expert at video productions, at 18 months old. :-))",1501804800,,167,4.793103448275862
8462997,5,B0059IV20A,My grandson has to watch this at least a couple times every time he comes over. He loves it.,1494633600,,92,3.8947368421052633
8462998,5,B0059IV20A,"Toddler watched it twice the day we received it, big hit! She spun in circles to Ring Around The Rosie, did her own version of EIEIO, and Happy Birthday. Loved the way it ended on a calming note with Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  Wish the children were more involved in depicting the finger rhymes. The Where is Thumbkin song just shows an adult hand with finger puppets which is a bit confusing to a toddler and Wheels on the Bus is a bit too manic.
There is a huge void in toddler videos, would absolutely love to find a DVD of teacher and children doing lots of finger rhymes. This grandma's memory fading a bit, I can remember the words of some rhymes but not the actions and some I can't even remember the words without a cheat sheet!",1473811200,2,739,4.316546762589928
8462999,5,B0059IV20A,"This is the only cd that calms my son. Definite live save in the car. It's also teaching him to count, his abcs, his fingers, bus sounds, etc.",1456790400,,142,4.107142857142857

8463001,5,B0059IV20A,"My 2 year old granddaughter loves this DVD.  Her favorite, and I can listen to it over and over with her  and it doesn't drive me crazy.  We misplaced the first one after about 3 months and had to order another",1426032000,,210,4.073170731707317
8463002,5,B0059IV20A,Great music to listen to in your car,1419552000,,36,3.625
8463003,5,B0059IV20A,This is the best Toddler CD & DVD ever.  Every kid should see this.  My son want to see or hear this over and over again.  He damaged it so I got another one.  But its a classic.  Funny and loveable.  You will not regret it.,1407110400,,224,3.760869565217391
