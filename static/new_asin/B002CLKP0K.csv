8364216,1,B002CLKP0K,"European customers beware: these DVDs are other than advertised *not* ""Region: All Regions"" but ""Region 1"", they won't play on BD players that are *not* hacked, hence only 1 star. It's a shame bc the movies are really great and deserve 5 stars :-((",1521417600,,248,4.659090909090909
8364217,5,B002CLKP0K,"If you love Ninja's, you will faint over this! Not your typical Ninja flick, this is actually pretty realistic and no one bleeds 50 gallons of blood with every nick.
Shows loads of different Ninja tricks of the trade to include that nifty little Ninja sword which is a Ninja Icon. They say the Ninja-To shown in the museum in Japan has not historical basis...perhaps it was donated by this movie since it looks almost identical?
Really good story line giving a glimpse of the politics of the time and how the Ninja clans were (are) masters of persuasion and trickery. A must see!",1511654400,,579,4.576923076923077
8364218,5,B002CLKP0K,"Saw these films in my youth.i Purchased them on tape but have since thrown away all the tapes stuff. So i decided recently to take another look at them and the price was right. The quality is not bad.
This is the series that got me really interested in Ninja (Shinobi). I love The stark black and white and the lack of special effects and computer graphics. It brings a raw and unglamerous reality to the life and perils of the ninja cult.
I highly recommend it as a movie fan. If you are a truely appreciate this genre it is a must have. The movie is the foundation to compare others too.",1501545600,,589,4.221238938053097

8364223,4,B002CLKP0K,"There are very, VERY many excellent samurai films. It's a shame then, that there are so few good movies focusing on the ninja. At least as far as what's been released in the U.S. anyway. Still, considering just how highly regarded ninja are in American pop culture, it's a mystery why the Shinobi No Mono series isn't more widely known.

The series is based loosely on true events and features far more grounded action than Ninja Gaiden fans might expect. After all, the real life ninja were all about infiltration, espionage, sabotage, assassination, and subterfuge with their enemies not knowing what hit them until far too late. Straight combat was strictly a samurai thing.

The first three films are part of a single story arc and takes place during Japan's Sengoku (Warring States) Period which lead to Tokugawa Ieyasu becoming the first supreme Shogun. The fourth movie is a stand alone story taking place a number of years later when Ieyasu was consolidating his power and features a different main character (though played by the same lead actor).

All in all, the Shinobi No Mono series is definitely worth a watch for ninja fans. Also, anyone interested in Japanese history, or even anyone with a taste for period political thrillers should check it out. We can only hope that the rest of this series will some day be released here.",1392854400,8,1343,4.8304347826086955
8364224,5,B002CLKP0K,"it was a great movie. Ninjas  are great to watch, I  had to buy one for myself and one as a gift.",1391472000,,97,3.3636363636363638
8364225,5,B002CLKP0K,"Wow !!! i am so glad i found this. A MUST HAVE for those who have an interest in such. The story line is as great as the action. The ONLY thing i could complain about is the fact that it is black n white n this makes it difficult at times to see exactly what is going on in a few action scenes that occur at night. The subtitles are very well done. I have been watching on & off all day.... so far i have seen 1-3.....the end of each one leaves me wanting more :)
 .... i am going to watch # 4 shortly. There is so much going on it is incredible. You will see a fantastic variety of authentic ninja skill, techniques & tactics displayed. It is clear .... that this is the cinematic ""soil"" into which all ninja movies have their roots deeply buried into. This, as great as it is....is not for everyone.... the emotionally immature.... in other words.....much of the younger generation.....will likely not like this as those with short attention spans will not be have the patience to be able to keep pace with the plot.",1290211200,22,1018,4.220512820512821
