Dad played the game on his Gameboy and son on his Nintendo DS. The movies are wholesome, yet not cheesy fun and adventure. The nice thing is that, with Amazon, you can build up an entire collection of them without it costing you an arm and a leg.",1224806400,,398,4.32
8021983,5,B000248XCQ,"If you liked Super Mario Bros. 3 as a game, if you collect Nintendo Swag, if you enjoy fantasizing about the Mushroom Kingdom, or if you just want a cute, very friendly kid's cartoon, this will do the trick.  If your kid plays some current video games like Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Strikers (a soccer game) or Super Smash Bros. Brawl that feature all these same characters still going strong decades later, these old shows will be a big hit and expand their imaginative universe.

Of course, as with all TV programs, I do not encourage more than an hour or two a day consumption at any age, especially childhood.  Balance this with reading, live role playing, creative writing and art, sports, etc.",1212624000,,705,4.669354838709677
