Love her leg warmers! Weights, a step and a stability ball are used for the other chapters.",1169942400,13,267,4.804347826086956
2641460,5,B000HT3S8K,"Tamilee Webb is the greatest of all workout instructors.  I have been using all of  her videos along with the ""Body for Life"" fitness/nutrition program and found that Tamilee provides the biggest ""bang for your buck"" workouts.  They are quick and effective,  you can do these at home on your own time.  Even the busiest of working moms will have time to workout using these videos.  Also try Tamilee's ""I Want That Body!"" workout video... it's the best!",1168473600,15,453,4.743589743589744
2641461,5,B000HT3S8K,Tamilee is always wonderful.  I like the short yet serious workout segments.  Good for all level of exercisers.,1167868800,8,111,5.111111111111111
2641462,5,B000HT3S8K,"There are other online retailers that already have released this, so if you don't want to wait till mid November, then try elsewhere first.  I couldn't wait for it because I really love Tamilee's dvds.  This is another great one from her.

In this workout, there are three different ten minute routines to do.  First there is the floorwork for lower body followed by a short but basic step routine using upper body toning moves for shoulders and arms).  Then last but not least there is pilates style ab work and regular moves like cycling and plank moves for a tight core.  With each 10 minute move, there is a countdown so you can see how much longer you have to go.  The segments are short enough anyway, but that in itself is a great thing because everyone can find even ten minutes to do a little exercise.

Even though the segments are short, I find this is very very helpful on days where you don't have much more time, and yet still effective so you feel that you are doing some good for yourself.  All you need for this is weights (mainly) and if you want to do the bonus workout at the end, you will need a stability ball.  I really enjoy doing this program because she is outgoing and motivating and it's an easy routine when you don't want to tough it out.  I highly recommend this to all levels of exercisers.",1161820800,44,1322,4.355102040816327

8141277,2,B000HT3S8K,i didn't really like this tape.i thought it did alot of pilate moves and a lot of planks.i thought it would be like her other tapes i have bought and like.it didn't make me want to do it.,1349481600,,187,3.9473684210526314
8141278,5,B000HT3S8K,I love Tamilee. She gives me a workout like no one else in very little time! And I ENJOY it! I have all her videos pretty much and I love each one. Hot Spots is my favorite though.,1349049600,,180,3.763157894736842
8141279,5,B000HT3S8K,"This is one of my favorite quick-workout videos. Tamilee has put together a fun combo of workouts.

My favorite on the video is the ""No-Nonsense Cardio Step."" It's easy to follow and she adds alot of variety so the time goes by really fast. It's a great 10-minute warm up, or repeat for a longer 20 or even 30 minute work out.

The ""Buns & Thighs"" is all on-the-floor workout. It reminds me of an 1980's style workout (she even wears leg warmers) with leg lifts for a great challenge.

""Abs to Core"" is definetly a challenging core workout that will challenge every level.

Fun, fun, fun ""Get on the Ball"" workout will chanllenge your balance and help with core stability and posture.

All around this is well worth the money and a video that you can use over and over again. Highly recommended!!!",1251504000,3,797,4.506944444444445

8141281,5,B000HT3S8K,"This DVD is excellent because each segment takes only 10 minutes.  Even when I am a bit tired or don't feel like exercising, I can go through  at least one segment. I will keep sticking this DVD and hope I can get great body like Tamilee sometime very soon!",1213920000,,257,4.224489795918367
8141282,5,B000HT3S8K,I did this workout for the first time today. I would consider myself an intermediate level exerciser and I was definitely sweating with this workout. This is the first DVD I have of Tamilee Webb and she is an awesome fitness instructor.,1199577600,3,236,4.642857142857143
