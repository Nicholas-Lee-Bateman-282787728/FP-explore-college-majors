8128318,2,B000G1ALRA,"A nice collection of cheapo HK horror flix... real grade B, nah grade C movies... some I remember some I don't recall ever seeing... But I got this set to see one specific movie that wasn't on the this set and was mislabled on the box/disc itself [not any sellers fault]
If you are looking for the '76 movie Devil's Express [also called Gang Wars] about an ancient demon in the NYC subways ... it is not in this sets [or solod seperately] Vol. 3 .... The movie here is just called ""The Devils"" an entirely diffrent movie... so don't get it if you're looking for the Devil's Express/Gang Wars ...",1213315200,5,595,4.36936936936937
