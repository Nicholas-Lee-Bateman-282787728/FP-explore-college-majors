8447917,5,B004Y4U0RG,"Am puzzled as to why the makers of Lewis have retired the series now......after all,the original Morse went until just before John Thaw died of cancer....probably because he was too ill to go on. Contrast this approach with that of the makers of Taggart,the Glasgow set crime series,last seen,at least by this writer in 2010 and hopefully still being made thirty years after the eponymous hero,Taggart,died. Am always amused when reviewers show their ignorance by claiming Chief Insp. Taggart still appears in the show! No,there have been several bosses in the mix since we first heard ""there's been a muurdeer""all those years ago! Sorry,Glaswegian accent even harder to put into words than strine! So hopefully Lewis will return with someone new....not likely,though,as his side-kick was quitting,too. Probably returning to god-bothering! As if!!",1381104000,,847,5.424242424242424
8447918,4,B004Y4U0RG,Series Number 5 maintains the standards of the previous 4 series.  The scripting is intelligent and the characters are given scope to develop their personalities.  This is worthy successor to Inspector Morse with the same high quality production values.  It is a pity the original Barrington Pheloung musical score was not retained as a further link to the forerunner.  This series treats its viewers as intelligent people who can understand subtext and the subtleties of detection and characterisation.  An excellent detective series with touches of quirkiness and humour that help lighten but not trivialise the mood.,1309651200,44,619,5.40625
8447919,5,B004Y4U0RG,"Just as a warning to those US/Canadian customers who might impulsively order this set; this is the euro (Region 2) version of US/Can (Region 1) Series 4.  Confusing? Yes, but the numbering system between regions is often different when Brit series are exported to other markets. The frequency and order of individual episode broadcasts can be altered and the series numbering system usually reflects the year in which the individual episodes were initially televised in each market.  Early on when ""Masterpiece"" added ""Lewis"" to it's schedule, they merged most of what had been series 2, 3, & 4  (in the UK) into US series 2 & 3 which resulted in the UK versions having one more series number, which reflected the actual years of the UK broadcasts.

These four episodes continue the slightly melancholy but beautifully produced police procedural in Oxford, first viewed almost twenty five years ago with the ""Inspector Morse"" mysteries.  Lewis, once Morse's lackey D.S., is now a Detective Inspector and has his own sergeant,  James Hathaway.  Lewis, while more mature and now in charge, is pretty much the same character he played in ""Morse"".  Hathaway on the other hand is very much a younger Cambridge educated Morse and, like Morse, Hathaway is brilliant but flawed so the critical dynamic of character remains the same in both series, just reversed.  As in ""Inspector Morse"" the university plays a consummate role just as important as the lead characters themselves.  Additionally the conflict of old religion intruding into the modern world is a continual thematic treatment in both series.

Initially I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of Lewis' character development and kept wishing him to become more of a prototypical lead rather than just a member of the ensemble.  However, after 20 episodes I've now come to the conclusion that the producers have made the wisest of choices and have produced a true successor to the Morse legacy.  If Lewis suddenly became a  brilliant, dashing detective it would ring false and be obvious to all that his character was manufactured to fit the part rather than be a continuum of the Colin Dexter novels.  The on again/off again romance between Lewis and Dr. Hobson (nicely played by Clare Holman) is realistic and touching in the same vein.  Holman played the role in the last couple Morse episodes and  provides a bridge between the two series.

However, I am concerned with what I perceive to be tampering by PBS. Not long after the premier episode aired Masterpiece Mystery became a co-producer of ""Inspector Lewis"".  Recent episodes have taken a rather unbalanced interest in youth oriented story lines at the expense of the traditional Morse themes with an inordinate number of shows focused  on Oxford students and/or younger faculty members. The Morse episodes typically were straight police procedurals that just happened to take place in the UK's most famous university town.  Morse and (Sergeant) Lewis were more likely to deal with the landed gentry or disgruntled townies than they were some wayward student. ""Inspector Lewis"" is running the risk of becoming a campus police drama to it's own discredit, and in the process, could lose it's loyal core audience by attempting to become a ""youth"" production.  Future episodes will dictate this outcome and I encourage ""Masterpiece Mystery"" to tread carefully.  Sequels that stray too far from the source material rarely have happy endings.

CODA:  After the better part of a year fighting with the amazonians they have FINALLY come to their senses and moved the region 2 edition of LEWIS SERIES 5 into a separate file where it should no longer be conflated with the region 1 edition (Masterpiece LEWIS Series 5).  I want to re-emphasize that this was not just an issue differentiating the DVD coding for each region, BUT rather that the editions were composed of entirely different episodes as the series numbering system is different in each market.  While I'm pleased this issue should no longer dog my days it should be noted this was an obvious fault reported repeatedly by myself and others  which fell on deaf ears.  Amazon needs to be a little more attentive to issues such as this as it only reflects poorly on the company.",1307059200,125,4242,4.994310099573258
