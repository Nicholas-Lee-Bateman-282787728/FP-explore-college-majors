8226245,2,B000WZALYS,"This movie was almost comical.  Not because of the lines but because of the production scenes.  The movie spent a ridiculous amount of time showing driving scenes through the Canyons.  They show these scenes at the beginning of the movie and at the end.  They continually drive by the same places over and over and over again.  Biggest complaint was the male actors wearing their blue jeans during the sex scenes.  Why wouldn't you want to be free and clear of them?  If the male actor doesn't want his lower torso shown, then use a stand-in.  Must not have had enough in the budget after filming all the scenes of driving through the canyon.  The ONLY thing I liked about the movie was the star (Aubrey Caldwell).  Smoking Hot looking.  The acting was average.",1453593600,,761,4.604477611940299

8226248,1,B000WZALYS,This movie is horribly acted and has a very weak story line that is all over the place.  The acting is akin to a porno.  Don't get excited there are no good sex scenes in this so you get the porno quality acting with out the sex...don't waste your money.,1389830400,,254,4.06
8226249,3,B000WZALYS,"Everyone's got their opinion of what makes a good movie; good character development, scenery, passion, dialogue, this one was just not that good. the characters were weak, the dialogue was ok, and the passion was questionable. The characters underwent some sort of change half-way through and and movie just flopped from there. Too bad; I liked the premise.",1362700800,2,357,5.172413793103448
8226250,1,B000WZALYS,"This is a grade F movie that is stupid, dull, hackneyed and lewd.  I am so sorry I wasted my money.",1362182400,2,99,3.7142857142857144
8226251,1,B000WZALYS,"Just about the most poorly written, filmed and acted movie I have ever seen. Do not waste a dime on this movie. The best part was a long ride into the canyon, we saw the same turns and scenery no less than 6 times. On the ride out of the canyon, we saw the same turns almost as many times. Bikinis (which rarely come off) also magically change colors during a scene. Awful.",1342224000,4,373,4.123287671232877
8226252,3,B000WZALYS,"I got the chance to watch this movie, and I think it is an Ok movie. It has a little of suspense, but at the end you kind of know what is going to happen.
