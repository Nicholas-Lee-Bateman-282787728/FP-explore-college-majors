8317604,4,B00004RW95,"""A Certain Sacrifice"" (Madonna's first movie) is an ""oddball"" indie, shot on-and-off over two years for a paltry sum of $20,000 (with virtually all of the actors in the film unpaid) in New York City.

Madonna played the part of Bruna, a Lower East Side resident who lives with three ""love slaves"" (one male, one female, one transgender). Bruna meets Dashiell (Pattnosh) in the water fountain in Washington Square Park and the two ""fell in love"". Later, Bruna is raped (by Kurtz) in a bathroom at a coffee shop. To exact retribution, Bruna enlisted her love slaves and Dashiell to abducted the rapist and ""sacrifice"" him, hence the film's title.

Madonna achieved wide success five years after the making of this movie. Directo / writer Jon Lewicki invited her to view it and at the conclusion of the screening session, and Madonna reportedly was not happy with the result. Subsequently a representative from Madonna offered to buy the rights for $5000 which Lewicki refused. She later sued (unsuccesfully) to halt it's release on video.",1155945600,2,1036,4.948275862068965
