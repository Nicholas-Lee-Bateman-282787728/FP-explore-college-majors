8171957,2,B000MTILXM,"Ted Pike comes back with a great documentary on the history surrounding Israeli occupation and abuses of the Palestinians.  Unfortunately, he, like his dispensational counterparts (i.e. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) still promote a dual covenant theology with regards to the unbiblical creation of the UN created state of Israel.

He, like they, believe that God's covenant with Israel (Jacob) was based upon blood and race; something the Apostle John clearly denied in his Gospel chapter 1:12-13.  Pike, like other dualist, teach that Israel can gain God's favor through obedience.  However, no where in the film does Pike call on Israel to bend a knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  Perhaps now is a good time to explain (listen up guys) -

There is no such thing as orthodox Judaism.  One cannot maintain a belief in the Old Testament while rejecting Jesus as both Lord and God. If a person says they believe in the Old Testament (Tanak) but they reject the Lord Jesus, well then, they really do not believe in the Old Testament.  Jesus Himself say that they are liars. Why?  Because the whole Old Testament pointed to Himself.

Next, Mr. Pike attempts to blame Zionism on Calvinism instead of Arminian/dispensational theology.  He says it is because Calvinism is covenantal - which is true.  However the basis for his argument centers on a preversion of Calvinism doctrinal teaching that popularly goes by the  the broad evangelical name ""eternal security.""  The true Calvinist teaching, which was not started by John Calvin but the Lord Jesus and Paul is known confessionally as ""perservenace of the saints.""  This teaching promotes perseverance unto holiness - not antinomianism.

If one wants to study UN created Israel's abuses in the Mid-East, then this is a good video (however, Mr. Pike and his wife sometimes seem to speculate with respect to their conclusion.)  But buyer beware, Mr. Pike, it would appear still holds to the system of theology created by John Nelson Darby in the 1830's.  What he does not realize, is that he is still part of the problem.",1174262400,3,2074,4.945086705202312
