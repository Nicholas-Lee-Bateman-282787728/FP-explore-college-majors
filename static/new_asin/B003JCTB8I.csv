As a fan of quirky documentaries, I found DISHES an enjoyable and enlightening production. The filmmaker and narrator Amy Levine, perplexed by a friend's devotion to Fiesta, decides to look into the phenomenon. She goes to a Fiesta warehouse sale, which reminded me very much of the many book sales I've attended, with the long line that starts hours before the doors open, the camaraderie that becomes competitiveness as soon as the sale begins, the frantic yet focused search for bargains. Levine attends a Fiesta collectors' convention, which includes a field trip to the Fiesta factory and assembly line. She interviews the collectors, who are candid about their obsession, with a few of them comparing the dishware to children or grandchildren.

Then there's the interviews with the Fiesta ware employees, who are resigned to the bizarre reactions their products evoke. One manager explains that the company only retires certain colors or items if sales are poor. Of course, this makes those very items collectible now, causing a spike in demand.

A fun documentary, short enough  at 46 minutes to satisfy without going on too long.",1393632000,7,1328,5.1342592592592595
