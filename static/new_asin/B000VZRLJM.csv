8220767,5,B000VZRLJM,"Violent, criminal mastermind, Heinz Klett (Raimund Harmstorf) escapes police custody in order to pull off his latest caper. Along w/ his cronies, Klett plans to rob a bank. First, the gang attacks an army convoy and steals some heavy weaponry, including machine guns and grenades! The bank job itself goes along swimmingly, as Klett and his mob storm the bank in awesome red masks, take hostages, and secure the cash. Unfortunately, the police soon have the place surrounded, and if that's not bad enough, some kid has somehow gotten a hold of one of the grenades! BOOM! Now, Klett and company grow more desperate by the minute. Will anyone get out of this situation alive? The true strength of BLOODY FRIDAY is the Klett character. He's a rather imposing figure at about 6'6"", w/ his flaming red hair and beard, huge Elvis sunglasses, leather pants, and bomber jacket. Harmstorf plays his menacing role w/ gusto and sadistic glee. A classic of German / Italian crime cinema... P.S.- Contains the weirdest sex scene montage ever. EVER!...",1404691200,,1038,4.937142857142857
8220768,1,B000VZRLJM,"""Bloody Friday"" is a badly dubbed German (with an Italian flair) crime drama that looks very dated by today's standards. Starring Raimund Harmstorf as Heinz Klett, the foul-mouthed and wholly despicable master criminal who starts the film in handcuffs only to escape and commit a bank robbery that turns into a trying hostage drama. The dialogue is dubbed into English so it is sometimes difficult to evaluate the performances accurately, but in general the acting is fairly appalling and the dubbing is worse. There is a lot of violence (watch for the hand grenade self-sacrifice in particular) most of which is gratuitous and does not further the plot in a meaningful way, though it does establish the fundamental evilness of Heinz and serves to contrast him with his costar, Christian (Amadeus August.) There is a lot of gore for a movie from this era, but the blood and special effects are laughable.

The print quality is bottom of the barrel: the scratches and optical flaws are numerous, though the feature itself is the biggest problem, as it comes across as a movie that is designed solely to shock (and it probably did in the early 70s) but now that far more graphic and realistic movies have come and gone in the genre, ""Bloody Friday"" is no longer particularly shocking which renders it impotent to captivate or entertain seriously. The characters are overacted caricatures and while it's violent and bleak, spellbinding it is not.",1395792000,,1443,4.938271604938271

This story begins in a Central European city. A prisoner is being escorted by two guards when he asks to use the WC. [The events in this movie are based on actual facts.] There is a plot to free him by slipping him a pistol. The alarm sounds but the guards at the door are distracted by a smoke bomb. ""Methodical plans usually work."" They plan a new crime. We see an office with data entry operators (circa 1971). Helen complains about her job. She talks to Luigi; Heinz is his closest friend. They plan to rob a bank. Helen meets an old friend (an army deserter). Helen brings news about American Army training. Heinz meets Christian (and his match). They plan to open a grocery store with their loot (a 100% yearly return on investment). They plan to ship out of the country via Hungary. ""A well-planned robbery can't fail"" says Heinz. Helen will do anything for a better life; it is very important to her now.

An Army truck rolls down the road. A log blocks the road so the truck stops. A police car follows them for a car chase. A thrown grenade stops it, they robbers get away. They put on masks to rob the bank. But the alarm sounds and the doors are locked. This gang is trapped with the hostages. Heinz calls the Chief of Police and gives his orders. Outside a grenade explodes and kills a policeman. The hostages give their names. One girl is a wealthy heiress (and boasts about it). Her father is called about the crime so he can raise half the money. One hostage has a heart problem. The police carry H&K MP-5 machine guns, except for the sniper on the roof. ""This is one of the worst catastrophes in the city."" Back at the hideout Helen hears a man coming and panics! Another mistake? We see the effects on the hostages. The ransom money is ready, a man leaves two suitcases by the door of the bank. The robbers leave the bank with their hostages and enter the getaway car provided by the police (which has a concealed transmitter).

Heinz is clever, he will avoid the helicopter that he requested. The police know this and will follow Plan A. But a patrolling policeman and his watchdog comes upon them. Their guns fire, then they switch cars. The police effect Plan C now. The robbers plan to hide in the woods at a small cottage picked beforehand. They get a doctor to treat the dog bites. Heinz converses with one of the hostages. ""She pushed me too far."" There is a fight among Heinz and Christian, and an unexpected event. Dozens of police arrive and close in by their cabin. The motor on their car won't start! ""You are completely surrounded, come out with your hands up!"" The police know how to use their machine guns. There are no survivors. [Perfect plans never allow for the unexpected, they look good on paper but not in reality.]

""No one can commit a crime without having to pay for it"" said Napoleon Bonaparte. This Bavarian crime movie is an interesting contrast from American crime movies. There is no Hollywood Production Code to censor their speech and actions. It is like one of those operas that ends with a pile of bodies. ""The French Connection"" was made around the same time. The criminals use UZI machine guns, is this a form of product placement?",1336435200,2,3211,4.474402730375426
8220770,3,B000VZRLJM,"First things first -- the DVD I bought from Amazon is the one labeled as being by ""Synergy,"" whoever they are.  The aspect ratio seems off, the print is scratched and dirty in places, and it is only available in dubbed English (no subtitles).  Nonetheless, the print actually becomes better as the movie progresses, and the presentation doesn't detract badly from the movie, as one can clearly see everything all too well.  It's hard to say what the ""message"" of this film might be, but I believe the director was trying to bring home the ruthlessness of the chief criminal, as well as how those who help him get sucked into the violence and madness even when they are trying to remain free of the consequences.  There is a (sort of) consensual sex scene that has to be seen to be believed ... any nudity is flashed by so quick it's almost subliminal, but what remains is how the scene is intercut with flashes of scenes from a slaughterhouse!  I think this was to disply both the brutality of the ringleader and his attitude towards women (and indeed most everyone is expendable second to himself).  You can read up more on this film in Blazing Magnums (Midnight Media), which is a great introduction to Italian crime (polizieschi) cinema.

All in all not a great copy of the film, but serviceable enough to appreciate it, so I just subtract a star for video quality while overall this is worth a look for genre enthusiasts.",1332547200,2,1425,4.608695652173913
