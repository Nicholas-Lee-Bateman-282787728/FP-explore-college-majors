Hector Elizondo in drag is the highlight of the movie for me. I also love Taylor Negron and the always hilarious Michael McKean. These hospital hijinks are my kind of funny. Hope one day to see it on dvd-i would snap it up!!!",1093305600,2,355,4.298507462686567
639589,5,6303398243,"Jammed full of soon-to-be-stars(or at least well-known performers) had tough job to better other hospital satires, and succeeds. Gags are just as good or better than most send-ups of this type, and story has beginning, middle and ending. Loved Dr. Prang's (Dabney Coleman's)role. Michael McKeon delightful obsessive-compulsive.

639590,3,6303398243,"There are some yucks in this burlesque of TV's General Hospital, but  you've got to concentrate.  What is interesting is the cast and what has  become of them since, and what they were before, especially in TV  land.
Michael McKean, who plays the lead, has had a fine career, but I  remember him best as Lenny Kosnowski on TV's ""Laverne and Shirley""; Michael  Richards who plays a bumbling mafia hit man became Cosmo Kramer on  Seinfeld; Patrick Macnee was John Steed of ""The Avengers"" from the sixties;  and although I'm sure you recognized Dabney Coleman, do you remember him  from ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman""?
Director Garry Marshall directed both  ""Laverne and Shirley"" and ""Mork and Mindy,"" which explains why ""Young  Doctors in Love"" plays a little like a scattered sit-com.  Nostalgic in a  cameo was Jacklyn Zeman, who, last I heard, is still ""Bobby"" on General  Hospital; and eye-popping in another cameo was Demi Moore, looking, I  swear, a little like Monica Lewinski with muscles.  (Moore was at the time  also a regular on General Hospital.)
This was the year (1982) in which  the beautiful Sean Young, who plays the female lead here, was also  presented in the classic sci fi ""Blade Runner.""  Who can ever forget those  close-ups as Harrison Ford examined her eyes to see if she was a  replicant?
The prize for best acting, however, goes to little known  Pamela Reed as frigid mousy Nurse Norine Sprockett, who is sexually  awakened by being romanced for her key to the drug cabinet, a surprising  bit of reality amid the general mayhem.",968371200,14,1552,4.809885931558935
639591,3,6303398243,"This movie does for medical school what ""Airplane!"" did for airline disaster movies.  It is a must-have for those with a love of the  ""B-side"" comedy and have a few extra beers. It follows the  paradigm of a soap opera with all the cliches. Without giving away too  much, an assorted bunch of characters pursue their medical degree (and each  other) and move through their residency.  Good for some very good laughs:  ""Due to a mix up in urology, there will be no apple juice served  today.""  Oh, yeah, Demi Moore and Sean young...",966384000,5,531,4.5638297872340425

639636,4,6303398243,"I saw this in a movie theatre when I was in medical school. I haven't yet purchased it. I saw many of the B&W doctor movies on TV-some starred Broderick Crawford(Highway Patrol), Buddy Ebsen, and other actors/actresses all of whom became famous later. Several of these movies were serious or had serious content. They were from the days when Interns and Residents weren't permitted to marry or live outside the hospital. 'Young Doctors In Love' is a spoof of these B&W movies. Not only is Michael Richards and his role a terrifically funny 'story within a story,' but the scenes when residents and the attending stood around patients' beds were hilarious. While similar in ways to ""Airplane,"" as was mentioned(especially the final scenes), this movie was just what I needed for my last several months of medical school.
I'll put a star rating after I obtain my own copy and see it.",1443571200,,881,4.802631578947368

639716,3,6303398243,"There's almost always something to laugh at in this comedy flick regarding at City Hospital, where the amorous young interns think that loveor at least lustis the cure for everything! Michael McKean (A Mighty Wind), Sean Young (Fatal Instinct), Hector Elizondo (""Chicago Hope""), Harry Dean Stanton (Anger Management) and Michael Richards (""Seinfeld"") star in this ""refreshingly wacky""  hospital parody from the director of Overboard and Runaway Bride!

The new interns at City Hospital are desperately hoping to survive their first year of residency which could prove difficult, since their minds are on the wrong body parts! But when one of the residents suddenly requires emergency surgery, the young wannabes must pull themselves and their clothes together and learn to mind their bedside manners!

This comedy takes me back to memory lane to when I was 9 going on 10 years old in the 4th grade during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1982 when Ronald Reagan was President and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 1981-1982.",1391731200,,1064,5.0685714285714285

639775,4,6303398243,"I had not watched the film for years.

Was not a hit when released.

It is still very funny.

A lot of cameos from THEN soap opera stars.  Look quickly for Demi Moore & Ed Begley Jr as well.  You see Garry Marshall briefly.

A movie for the time, the then topical references.

No extras of course.  Good the did it letter box or wide screen

NO chapter list inside.

Now, this bugs me.  On the back of the DVD holder it of course talks about the film & mentions ONLY SOME of the actors in it.

It is how the actors that are mentioned the I do NOT like.  Sean.  INSTEAD OF MENTIONING her notable films ""Blade Runner"", ""No Way Out"" & ""Stripes"" it mentions a bomb movie ""Fatal Instinct"".  Michael McKean, easy should have mentioned GARRY MARSHALL'S  classic hit ""Laverne & Shirley"" no we see ""A Mighty Wind"".  Hector Elizondo OK for the mention of ""Chicago Hope"" but how about GARRY MARSHALL's ""The Princess Dairies"" or any other of their hit movies?  Harry Dean Stanton, OK on the""""Anger Management"" mention but where was the ""Alien"" mention?

Michael Richards of course got ""Seinfeld"" but it does not explain how the above mentioned actors were talked about.

Also, Dabney Coleman got NO mention in this section .

A funny film to this day.",1241568000,,1239,4.466367713004484
639845,5,6303398243,"One of the TOP TEN funniest movies ever made in the USA! This movie features many diversified actors who portray roles in multiple story-line pundits. However, this movie is NOT for children and has profanity and some nudity, but this is not so pervasive that it detracts from its presentation. This movie contains lighter real-life scenarios, which many viewers could easily identify with, yet illustrates many deeper observations from the medical community contrasting intelligent doctors and nurses with inappropriate bedside manners. Overall, this movie takes a different look at many good medical professionals who become prisoners to their own vices.",1239753600,2,656,5.57

639849,5,6303398243,"Waited a long time for this movie.  It is just so FUNNY!!!  It makes perfect parody of just about every Daytime/Nitetime Soap Opera currently on modern TV.  Plus with the cameos of a few well-known soap stars it just provides that idea that some of those serious soap opera stars can actually be FUNNY!!!  In addition, it introduces some unknown stars that went on to become regular TV actors with their own show (Like Richard Dean Anderson as the drug dealer, he started in a Soap Opera then went onto bigger shows like MacGyver and Star Gate SG-1.)",1215648000,2,550,4.581632653061225
639850,5,6303398243,"Another movie that my father chalks up as: YUCK! And again, now he likes it, lol. Go figure! This movie is not short of stars as well as up and coming stars. It stars Sean Young (Dune, No Way Out, Stripes), Harry Dean Stanton (Down Periscope), Michael McKean (D.A.R.Y.L.), Dabney Coleman, Ted McGinley (Married...with Children, Love Boat, Revenge of the Nerds), Taylor Negron (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Last Boy Scout, Easy Money), and Michael Richards (Sienfeld). Don't forget Hector Elizondo also.

The 80's brought us Airplane which was a spoof on airplane movies. Young Doctors in Love is a spoof on anything about the hospital, its residents, and patients. The calamity in the hospital is hillarious and its got it all: nudity, comedy, cross-dressing, and suspense. Everything is going on in this L.A. Hospital: Doctors healing ducks, doctors flirting with nurses, patients flirting with nurses, interns taking drugs, a chemist drinking urine, the head doctor throwing a temper-tantrum when someone wears the same white cap as himself as well as taking out a gun and trying to shoot his accountant, and finally a hitman sent to kill a member of the mob who is a patient at the hospital.

If you like spoofs then this is a must have for your collection. It's one of those classics that doesn't get much attention. The first time you watch it, you'll laugh hysterically. Then a few times later it will just be hillarious and silly. So if you like comedy, hijinks, spoofs then this one will grow on you.",1208044800,3,1513,4.837837837837838

I might've given it 5 stars instead, but in my sort'a humble opinion  ;-)  it wasn't quite so ""inspired original"" as ""Airplane!"" was. But it was awfully close. Terrific! (I'm glad it's on DVD now 'cause my old VHS's color-tint quality has been looking sort-of greenish for the last few years. I could use a new copy of the movie.;)",1204588800,,432,4.671052631578948

I jokingly like to tell people that Harry Dean Stanton's portrayal of the hospital pathologist led me to my own choice of specialty.  He doesn't shave, analyzes urine by drinking it, and swigs beer out of a can in the operating room!  Who wouldn't want to be like this guy?

Also brilliant is Hector Elizondo as a foul-mouthed, cross-dressing Mafioso.

Don't miss this one?",1202688000,,503,4.858823529411764
639853,4,6303398243,"Not a whole lot of sight gags in this film, but in their stead are some great dialog and situational comedy.

In brief we have a brand new group of interns beginning their stint at City Hospital on New Year's Eve. The film is roughly divided into episodes by the holidays of the year and moves along at a brisk pace. The interns range from a snobbish, disliked but brilliant Dr Simon August to the inept, pill-seeking Dr Phil Burns, all under the `famous' and tough tutorage of Dr Prang.

The interns go from classes in pathology and surgery to their stints in the emergency room - always followed by rousing word play and tricks (my favorite is the urine taste testing).

Playing as concurrent plots, a gangster dresses up as a woman to watch over his hospitalized father and is wooed by one of the interns for the entire year. Another is the rival gang's hit man (Malamud) whose rotten luck gets him everything from an anal exam to a kidney transplant. The only thing he misses is his assigned target, gang chieftain Sal.

This movie is a no-brainer. You needn't think about it, just listen to the dialog. It's enjoyable although perhaps a bit inane. Some strong language and nudity probably makes this unsuitable for children under 13.

Dabney Coleman is perfect as the arrogant staff chief, a typecast part for him, but hey-he plays it so well. The real standout here though has got to be Hector Elizondo as a mafia guy who is forced to dress up as a woman to keep his identity a secret steals the movie. He is absolutely hilarious using the steroetype Italian saying ""f***"" all the time. I am Italian and this did not bother me at all. Everyone will also know who the inept hitman of a rival mafia family is, in a very early in his career role.

So when I finally picked it up at my local retailer and went home and watched it, I was less than enthusiastic.  The reality didn't quite hold up to the memory.

What I thought was going to be a fun parody of daytime hospital dramas (e.g. General Hospital, The Doctors, etc), was just another boring comedy (if even).  Sure, there are a few cameos by former and some current GH stars, but the similarities end there.

Aside from that, it just wasn't funny.  Nothing really made me laugh out loud.  I was expecting some good Airplane style parodies but it fell flat by comparison.

Definetely not worth the money.  I waited for years for this and was left with the perverbial ""what was I thinking???""",1118016000,2,833,4.421052631578948

The crime boss dressing like a woman to protect his hospitalized father from a hitman (Seinfeld's Krammer)is hilarious ""Yeah, I play the f*cking guitar.  Is that a special kind of guitar.

An all-star cast, talented director, great one-liners, sick and twisted jokes, and a wonderful ""Airplane"" style parady of soap operas.

This is a sick movie at times, but always funny, suprisingly fresh for it's date (yes, it IS 20 years old, some jokes are dated) and well written (ala Mel Brooks style) and well directed.  This is one funny movie!!!!!!",1105228800,2,526,4.5638297872340425
