My 20 month old Daughter LOVES IT!It took a couple of runs through to get her full attention, but from the initial ""catchy"" tune & education of the intruments to the GREAT MUSIC she loves it! The lesson of working together is also nicely implemented. A STRONG RECOMENDATION, THIS DVD IS GREAT!",1013990400,2,321,4.649122807017544
1391648,2,B000053VCP,"This was the worst Elmo dvd yet.  It lost my childs attention thoughout the whole movie.  Then only part that he actually watched was the very beginning. This movie is nothing like Elmo in Grouchland, or CinderElmo..... which were great and my son will sit and watch both of those over and over again..... they really captured his attention.  He loves them!!!! Unike the Peter and the Wolf movie.  I would not recommend this at all!",1006214400,2,432,4.644736842105263
1391649,5,B000053VCP,Sesame Street is king. This effort is excellent and I even recognized the string player who is alumni. I recommend this for any kid that likes music and a great story.,1005696000,,167,4.419354838709677
1391650,5,B000053VCP,My two year old loved this. It not only entertains it also gives children an introduction to different instruments. It also shows children that they need to work together in order for things to sound right. Great music and great fun. I highly recommend it for any preschooler and even those children who are a little older yet love music.,1004572800,3,338,4.65
1391651,5,B000053VCP,"My daughter and I absolutely LOVE this video. It is fun, appropiately paced, and it is actually very educational. The members of the orchestra blend nicely with the muppets, and the story is very well told. And best of all: Elmo is the main character!

1391672,4,B000053VCP,a music teacher colleague of mine uses this all the time and brags about it so I bought it too. I have yet to use it but I think it might be good on one of those days I am sick and have a sub in my classroom. My favorite is the classic Disney version.,1414022400,,251,3.581818181818182
1391673,4,B000053VCP,"I thought a video on classical music would be dull but my kids love watching it , especially my daughter. Is Elmo in everything???

1391678,5,B000053VCP,"What a wonderful, fun and educational way to introduce classical music and instruments to kids!  As a music teacher, I do a unit on Peter and the Wolf and I love ending the unit with the kids watching this video.  To fit into the class time, I  skip the introduction of Elmo trying to figure out how to make his band sound better and it works perfectly.  The kids love it  - grades 1 and 2.  Great to leave for music class substitute too!",1357689600,,438,4.154761904761905
1391679,4,B000053VCP,My nephew Quinn loves Sesame Street.  I believe this video should help to get him ready to attend a classical concert or ballet next time he visits Philly.,1356739200,,155,4.535714285714286
1391680,4,B000053VCP,I grew up listening to the real Peter and the Wolf so when I saw this I thought it would be the perfect way to introduce it to my toddler. It's a little different but it still has the great music in it.,1355184000,,202,3.7209302325581395
1391681,5,B000053VCP,"This is one of those kids videos that the parents enjoy every bit as much the children.
I agree that this is not for the very young (i.e. 2-3 years old).  This is a step up in sophistication compared to Elmo's World.
But if your child can follow a story line, sit still for 30 minutes, and perhaps handle a little education thrown in the mix, then he or she would be at the right age for this delightful video.  It's a pretty good rendition of Peter and the Wolf, and you have got to love Keith Lockhart interacting with the muppets.  He's a natural!  The musicians sample different instruments, which represent the different characters of the story.  Having listened to Peter and the Wolf myself as a child (the symphonic version), it was alot of fun to be walked through the Elmo version with Keith Lockhart and the boston pops.  Although my children have long outgrown all their old elmo videos, I held onto this one, as I wouldn't mind watching it again some time, maybe next with grandkids.  My son was briefly afraid of wolves following this (at age 3), but he got over it pretty quickly.  He was also afraid of the abominable snowman in Rudolph, so take it with a grain of salt.",1355184000,,1185,4.428571428571429
1391682,1,B000053VCP,This is supposed to be an introduction for kids to Peter and the Wolf. Both Peter and the Wolf are overwhelmed by rhe padding needed to make this into a 45 minute DVD. Elmo and his friends trample the story to sell the disc.,1352851200,,224,4.113636363636363
1391683,5,B000053VCP,"The children I watch love the bright colors, the music and it even teaches them something.  I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to another party.",1299110400,,168,4.6

1391685,5,B000053VCP,"This was a big hit with a young boy who loves both Sesame Street and music.  He watches it over and over.  Recognizable classical musicians interact with Elmo and the other characters.  And of course Peter and the Wolf, by Sergei Prokofiev is a great way to introduce children to classical music, and has been performed worldwide since it was written in 1936.",1260921600,,359,4.666666666666667
1391686,5,B000053VCP,I bought this DVD to use with a summer music enrichment class I was teaching and the kids loved it!  It does an awesome job showing the viewers what each instrument looks and sounds like and the kids love to watch it.,1252800000,,217,4.166666666666667
1391687,5,B000053VCP,"I'm an elementary music teacher, so I got this to show my 1st grade classes as a culmination to our Peter and the Wolf unit.  I love it for showing the kids how the instruments are played as well as the appropriate behavior for an orchestral performance.  The kids loved the fact that these well-known characters were playing parts in Peter and the Wolf.  My 2 year old Elmo fanatic loved it because...well, because it's Elmo.",1241136000,,426,4.578947368421052
1391688,5,B000053VCP,"As an elementary school teacher, I'm always on the lookout for great instructional videos for the younger grades (K-1st grade). This one fits the bill perfectly. The humor really appeals to 6-7 year-olds, and the action is not too intense. I especially like how this video deals with the duck's run-in with the wolf. Makes me laugh every time. One word of caution, though: this video is a bit less than 45 minutes. More like 40 even. Be prepared for a wrap-up lesson after viewing.",1231891200,,481,4.670588235294118
1391689,5,B000053VCP,My kids love ELMO but they get bored with the movies because they are just episodes clumped together normally. This movie is actually a movie with a plot and lasts more than 20 minutes. I also love it because it exposes children to the symphony and how stories can be told through instruments. Good pick for a semame street kid.,1230336000,,328,4.483333333333333
1391690,5,B000053VCP,"My two year old sister & I watched this video six times in one day! We both love it! I was deeply involved in the music department while I was in high school and I love how much she enjoys watching the story and listening to the music. It was appropriately editted for children (taking out the guns, the wolf eating the duck, etc.) and I'm thrilled they featured the Boston Pops Orchestra! Wonderful!",1228694400,,400,4.418918918918919
1391691,5,B000053VCP,"This is a great way to introduce children or students to Peter and the Wolf and orchestral instruments.  My music appreciation class loved it and they remembered the instruments much better than from the audio tape I used previously.  There is a little creative deviation from the original Peter and the Wolf story, but it didn't really interfere with the presentation.  We loved it!",1224892800,,383,4.953125
1391702,5,B000053VCP,"I bought this as a gift for my nieces.  They love Sesame Street. So, they will love this DVD.",1224806400,,93,3.8947368421052633
1391703,1,B000053VCP,This disk is a lot of sesame street characters and very little music and very little of the original story. I did not even bother to give it to my grandchildren... just threw it away. If anyone wants to hear the story of Peter and the Wolf read to the original music... get something else.,1183420800,2,289,4.2727272727272725
1391704,4,B000053VCP,"My children love elmo and they like this movie a lot too. It's not as good as ""Elmo Goes to Grouchland,"" but for obvious reasons. Grouchland had a better budget, lots of singing and dancing and was educational as well.",1178668800,,218,4.475
1391705,5,B000053VCP,"As a music teacher, I am looking for ways to encourage learning. This DVD includes games for the children after they have viewed it. It incorporates learning instruments with the recognizable characters of Sesame Street. Fun for me as well as fun for the kids.",1174521600,,260,4.8
1391706,5,B000053VCP,"We rented this for our [...] daughter and she loved it so much we watched it every day until it was due. Now she is four and really into musical instruments, so I bought it for her. She loves it and now is asking for her own violin, tuba, drums and piano!!",1154563200,,256,3.9423076923076925
1391707,3,B000053VCP,This video is good for children who want to learn about an orchastra.  It is hard to keep a younger child interested (2-3yrs).  Adults will probably enjoy it with their children and take the time to review the parts of the story with the child so it will stick.  I rate it average.  Good for kindergarten and such.,1142380800,6,314,4.362068965517241
1391708,4,B000053VCP,"The first time my 2 1/2 year old daughter and I sat down to watch this, I thought it was a bomb.  She lost interest and I kept waiting for the ""Peter and the Wolf"" part to begin. After we watched it again (and knowing where it was going) we really enjoyed it.

Now my daughter requests it at least one a day and has supplimented this with listening to the narrated recording that we have on CD.  It is her favorite video and she names and recognizes all the different instruments and is beginning to pick out those instruments on other recordings.

What you do have to content with during this story is Baby Bear and his Father.  This is the only part where we lose interest.  Granted, I'm not a fan of their's, but they are annoying!

The rest of the story is top notch and the blending of the Sesame Street story with the traditional one is well done.

Also, the games that are provided are a nice touch.  We just wish there was more of seeing the orchestra play.",1140652800,7,965,4.229508196721311
1391709,5,B000053VCP,"Our 19th month old son LOVES this DVD. We are sesame street fanatics and this is probably in the top 5. We also recommend

Kids's Favorite Songs 2, A Magical Halloween Adventure, Christmas Eve on Sesame Street & Sesame Street's 25th Birthday.",1136160000,7,242,4.761904761904762
1391710,5,B000053VCP,"This video is brilliant, but I had not realized how brilliant until a few days ago when we picked up a book version of the story.  [We have owned this tape for about 2 years.]

As we were going along my 3 year-old son was humming various --and appropriate!-- sections of the music that corresponded to the action on the page.

In addition, my 5 year-old daughter was telling me about what instrument was used to portray the characters.  When I was humming she reminded me that I should try to sound more like an oboe (for the duck).

So Five BIG Stars for this video.  Not only does it tell the classic Prokofiev tale, but it opened the doors to musical composition in ways that I had not even dared to hope for.  Bravo!

My 1 year old 1/2 chip-toothed niece watched elmo and cried when he sang but i think that she was cryin' in happiness' t'aint that a truth?

-Watch this Classic, SESAME STREET for ever!",1107216000,,385,4.422535211267606
1391730,3,B000053VCP,"This is cute and clever and my older son, who is four, truly enjoys it. This may not be the best choice, however, for younger toddlers who are just discovering Elmo. It was given to my older child when he was 18 months-old and it sat unwatched until he was three because it didn't hold his attention. I've had the same experience with my youngest son, who is now 18 month-old.  He adores Elmo and enjoys other Elmo videos very much, but the segments in this story where Elmo himself isn't present, and there seem to be a lot, don't seem well-suited to very short attention spans. The musical segments are a bit more sophisticated and the storyline itself requires a bit more maturity than the other Elmo videos.

This isn't meant as a criticism because it is charming and educational tale, it's just a caution that, in my experience, this one is better suited to the video collections of older toddlers and preschoolers.",1096934400,17,920,4.603658536585366
1391731,5,B000053VCP,"It took my 2-year-old a couple of viewings to get interested in this one, but now he's hooked and asks for it every day.  He seems especially amused by seeing familiar characters like Elmo, Telly, and Zoe ""disguised"" as Peter, the Duck, and the Bird.  The Wolf is growly without being too scary for a little one.  The actors who play the musicians are really appealing -- the only false note is Keith Lockhart's incredibly stiff performance.  But he is a conductor, after all, not an actor, so that doesn't matter to my toddler, who sits enraptured through the whole thing, singing along with Elmo and his band, and then wants to see it again.  I'd love to see Sesame Street do the ""Carnival of the Animals"" next.",1082592000,4,713,4.5390625
1391732,5,B000053VCP,"...also one of the best visual versions of Peter and the Wolf, itself.  The humor is infectious.  Sesame Street gets around the issue of the wolf eating the duck quite well.  This is one of the videos that my son and I can sit down together and watch over and over with enjoyment.  A wonderful way to introduce little ones to the world of classical music.  I hightly recommend this tape.  The Boston Pops are excellent, and the introductory and closing materials involving Sesame Street characters and their attempt to form a band is also well done.
Bravo to all concerned.",1076025600,7,573,4.623762376237623
1391733,5,B000053VCP,"I am completely in love with this DVD, as is my 2 year old daughter. I picked it up wanting not only to entertain her, but also educate. Happily, this does both, and it will still be watchable when my little ones are older.
Baby Bear is taken by Papa Bear to see the Boston Pops Orchestra perform Peter and the Wolf, and the story is set in motion as Baby Bear listens to the music and imagines his Sesame St friends as the characters. Each character is followed in the story by a Boston Pops member playing the instrument respective to them, which will give children a clearer understanding of how the instrument voices the character. Elmo is adorable as Peter, Big Bird plays Grandfather, Oscar and Zoe accompany Elmo on his hunt as the Cat and Bird, and the wolf is of course, the Wolf!
The Boston Pops are at their finest here, and everything about the instruments, musicians, and the musical work itself are explained in a fun, funny, and educational way. One of the most wonderful things about the story was a slight change made in the fates of the Duck and the Wolf - when Telly (Duck) discovers he is to be eaten in the story, he is a bit shocked and decides to sit out, (a particularly funny moment!). And rather than shooting the wolf, the creative team here decided to catch him with butterfly nets and ropes and capture him without violence. For this mom, that was a welcome surprise.
For anyone with kids 2 to 12, Elmo lovers, or an adult like me who just appreciates great music and loves to see their little ones smile at a great show, pick this one up today.",1072137600,19,1574,4.375426621160409
1391734,5,B000053VCP,"My 19 month old loves this DVD. We only have 4 kid's movies, this one is the one that she requests constantly. I like it because I know she's learning something, and it's entertaining without being annoying. She likes it because it has music, 'animals', and, now 'ELMO!'.
She recognizes the music from Peter and the Wolf if it is played without accompanying video, even to the extent that she has learned the animals' accompanying music, and will 'act' like them sometimes when she hears it. (or, in one case, any time she hears a flute, she asks for Peter WOLF ELMO!)
The concepts of 'orchestra', 'conductor' and 'music telling a story' are introduced within the main plot of the Sesame Street Characters wanting to create a band, then Baby Bear's big treat for the day is that Papa Bear takes him to the Boston Pops to 'hear' Peter and the Wolf. Kids see enough orchestra and individual instruments to get the idea, but the Muppets then act out the story as the orchestra is playing, with, for example, the Violinist hamming it up and following 'Peter' (Elmo) around the story.
It's a great way to tell the story, introduce music and instruments, and be entertaining!
Definitely a keeper!",1068422400,,1190,4.698564593301436
1391735,3,B000053VCP,"My 17-month-old daughter is crazy for Elmo, so I bought this one to add to her collection.  The story is very cute and well-done, but my daughter doesn't seem to be interested.  I noticed that most of the reviewers whose kids loved it were closer to 2 or 2 1/2, so I'm hoping she'll like it when she gets a little older.  I just thought I'd let people with young kids know this might not be the best choice.  Rent it first, anyway.  My daughter LOVES the ""Babies, Dogs and more"" Elmo video and also ""Seseme Street's 25th Anniversary Celebration.""",1058918400,4,546,4.42

It's very educational and entertaining.  How many kids' dvd's can you say that about?
To any and all Muppet fans of all ages, this is a instant classic.  I loved it just as much as my 2 yr. old son did.  He loves every single bit of the video, and I have no qualms about him watching it.
Two year olds don't know what popguns are.  This is all just in good fun.
It's a great dvd for any young child's collection!",1053648000,4,622,4.327586206896552
1391737,5,B000053VCP,"Great fun for toddlers, older kids and adults! Even though I find Baby Bear 10 times more annoying than Elmo, I can sit through this one as much as my toddler wants. It's also an excellent showcase of DVD technology with the interactive games and other special features on this disc. One minor issue I have with it though is the menu that requires two selections to get anywhere. (Almost as annoying as an ""Are you Sure?"" dialog box).",1044576000,2,434,4.506329113924051
1391738,5,B000053VCP,"It's an amazing video for kids!  Without being formal, SS places the instruments into the musical and video story line.  They  engage kids with a charming story and add a few jokes adults will enjoy too.  In addition, they have included extras such as games,  listening to the music while viewing the instruments instead of the story, and just listening to the music with the SS voices removed.  It includes important messages about group cooperation, responsibility, and recognition of others.  From this video, my daughter has learned the look and sound of the violin, flute, french horn, and drums.  She knows the melody of each voice and identifies it within a few notes of being played.  Now, still at two, she wants to see an orchestra perform, practices conducting,  interprets music she has never heard, and acts out plays.  Kids are amazing.",1018051200,11,850,4.915492957746479

The story that brackets ""Peter and the Wolf"" is entertaining in its own right, and manages to convey information not only about music, but such other things as cooperation and good theater behavior.  The reviewer below who took the video out a few minutes in after seeing a muppet (in the part of one of ""Peter's"" hunters) carrying a pop gun, should have watched further.  Great care has been taken to remove violent or too scary elements from the original story.
