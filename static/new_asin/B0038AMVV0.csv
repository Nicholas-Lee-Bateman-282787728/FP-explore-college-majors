4084266,4,B0038AMVV0,"I picked this movie up on a whim. I consider myself a horror junkie but I had never heard of this flick. The gross cover didn't help (I love gross but the cover makes the movie look like a crappy low budget torture porn) but I saw the postive excerpts on the cover and saw a few positive reviews on Amazon and IMDB and went for it. Plus the super adorable Matt Dallas (Kyle XY) being in  the movie sold me.

The movie starts a little slowly and has the generic babysitter in trouble cliches but the movie looks good for being so low budget. The first thirty minutes or so of the movie is an above average slasheresque flick with a few good chase sequences. More importantly, you will notice that something just seems off about the family and child but you can't quite put your finger on it.

The movie then turns into something else completely with a twist that is so ridiculous it has to be seen to be believed. I don't want to ruin anything but things get crazy and you will be sucked in for the rest of the ride.

There is some gore and a little torture but none of it was disgustingly excessive or exploitive as the cover would have you believe.

The dialogue and acting is quality above and beyond direct to dvd horror crap (and even most big budget horror) and the movie looks pretty decent. There are quite a few darkly funny moments too.

I thought it was a tight and enjoyable horror movie with a fun ending that had me hoping for a sequel.

My gripes? Matt Dallas (love interest) is only in three scenes and his character could've been utilized in the plot far more and should've been. Some of the gore  effects are underwhelming. Also, sometimes I wished the movie looked just a little better but all things considered it looked quite good. Lastly the movie could've been a bit more scary...

But those are minor quips in the grand scheme of the movie. I sorta loved it and can't wait to share it with unsuspecting friends! The movie is original, fun, entertaining, well paced, tricky, kinda gross and quite funny.

You owe it to yourself to check out this gem if you call yourself a horror fan.",1276473600,8,2106,4.3631713554987215
4084267,5,B0038AMVV0,"This is a GREAT example of how to do an 80s style slasher movie with occult elements! 'Babysitter Wanted' is BOTH scary AND suspenseful with some real gross-out moments that will please gorehounds while not going over the top. This movie was actually made BEFORE 'House of the Devil' (which the filmmakers point out in the audio commentary) which has a strikingly similar plot and got the jump on BW by being released first. Still, this is the better movie in my opinion. Unlike HOTD 'Babysitter Wanted' isn't boring but still manages to build the tension and suspense VERY effectively, while introducing some interesting new characters into the horror lexicon. Sarah Thompson is great in the lead role (even though she is bound and gagged for a long time) and reminds me a lot of Jennifer Connelly. It's hard to mention the best plot points / twists without spoiling the movie, so I urge anyone interested in solid scary horror to check this movie out ASAP and AVOID READING OTHER REVIEWS which may contain spoilers! This is one of the good ones that makes our endless search satisfying.",1276214400,6,1088,4.792553191489362

4084271,3,B0038AMVV0,"People often ask how I find and pick the really independent films I sometimes review. In the case of Babysitter Wanted, it was an easy choice, as nothing is scarier to me that an evil child. Strangely enough the film also features several cast members from a TV show I really liked, Kyle XY. The story begins with the deeply religious, Angie (Sarah Thompson), going away to college. Looking for some extra money, she picks up a job babysitting for a family living in the middle of nowhere. Everything seems normal at first, until one night someone tries to break in, and to everyone's surprise, the beautiful young girl is not the target of his rage. This film was very unusual for a religious based horror film, as it wasn't over the top with religious jargon. It was a major theme of the film, but they don't beat you over the head with it the way other films do. It's also unlike your usual slasher films as it has a good cast, a decent and somewhat unique story, and most important of all, it doesn't move at lightning speed. Almost every slasher film I've ever seen has 15 minutes of story and then it's one big chase, but that doesn't happen here. They spend a lot of time on the story and when things do happen, they are pretty surprising. Sarah Thompson stars as the babysitter, while being your typical beautiful horror movie girl, she was also very credible and connected with the audience. Watching this film, you feel like you know her or someone like her, and you'll be cheering for her in a way you really don't do in films like this. She's paired with Kyle XY himself, Matt Dallas, another really good looking, likeable person, that audiences will also relate to. Once you see the whole picture, it's going to seem a bit odd to you, but the Directors and Casting people really hit the nail on the head, making this seem like anything but a slasher film until the time was just right, making for a really enjoyable and unique type of film.",1409443200,,1953,4.473389355742297
4084272,1,B0038AMVV0,"This movie would've worked a lot better as a thirty minute episode of Tales From The Crypt or some other scary show anthology. Because it tries to draw its paper-thin plot out to feature length, huge flaws in the script quickly jump out at you, as opposed to all of the other, scarier things that are supposed to jump out at you during a horror film.

Angie, a devout Catholic girl, travels far from home to attend a community college where she plans to major in art history. Just let that sink in for a bit. Although this community college has dorms (???) she is staying with an immediately hateful roommate who has managed to let Angie's bed slip through her fingers. To find the cash to support herself and get a new bed, Angie decides to babysit a quiet boy who lives with his rustic mom and dad way out in the bluffs. Then things get spooky!

Ha ha. No, they don't. There are a few well done moments at the start of the film, including a quick false scare in an art class, but the script is too threadbare to really hold too much suspense or interest. First of all, the characters are so stereotypical that they come across as bored of themselves. You have the world's worst acted pot head, the dashing love interest with no personality traits other than a sudden and inexplicable willingness to be The Perfect Guy, and a clueless cop or two.

And, of course, there's Angie, perhaps one of the most boring characters I've ever encountered in film. Her major character traits include being frightened by everything and talking to herself with some of the most wooden dialogue I've seen outside of a community college video brochure. ""Maybe watching some TV will help me relax,"" she says at one point to no one at all. Oh, brother. Then she turns on the TV and it's too loud! ""You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud if you don't want to wake people up,"" she says as she lowers the volume. Now THAT'S dialogue!

Anyway, when Angie's lines DO get a little spunky, they are equally cheesy, just in the opposite direction. Obviously, her babysitting gig goes wrong in a few ways, and she gets the chance to scream and run and fall down for no reason and kick and claw and slash with a few choice tidbits like ""Suck it!"" or something like that. But it's still pretty humdrum stuff. A lot of this is because for the first fifty minutes, the movie uses the ""slow pan with loud rising violin sound like something exciting is going to happen AND IT'S A ... [insert nonscary thing here]"" trick once every two minutes. Scary movies have to create atmosphere, but this editing trick is like the iron lung of horror movie tropes, and it gets really old, really fast. At one point, alone in the kitchen, Angie reaches for the cupboard. We see her hand move slowly, the tense trill of the music rises in volume, she opens the cupboard, the music HITS A CRESCENDO AND -- DEAR GOD WHAT IS IT? -- there are cups there. That's it.

The only character or moment to have any kind of spark is the boy's father, who is trying to hard to channel Bruce Campbell that it's almost admirable. However, his character and his moments to shine -- as well done as they are -- feel really out of place in the banal and rather predictable rest of the film. As dull as its leading lady, the movie would've had a lot more spark had it been released as a short film with all of its bloated musical scares and cheesy character development sliced away leaving nothing but the raw meat of it behind.",1402617600,,3462,4.411580594679187

A college girl takes a job as a babysitter and ends up with her life in danger from a deranged killer.  This film covers every horror movie cliche ever conceived.

SPOILER ALERT! ...

By the time the cute little boy she is babysitting is revealed to be the Devil's spawn, you saw it coming from a 1000 miles away.  The box cover is misleading.  The movie contains almost no nudity or gore.

The acting is chilling, gripping and extremely suspenseful! There is a movie I know the difference between a cheap made horror flick w/poor acting and a great one.

4084279,4,B0038AMVV0,"Babysitter Wanted (2008) is an effectively chilling tale of horror, that moves along at a nice clip, providing a few surprises along the way, before heading down a familiar path at the finish, as student Angie Albright (Sarah Thompson) arrives at a community college to study art, and winds up battling for her life.

A religious person, Angie is troubled that young women in the area have disappeared, and that someone seems to be following her.  After meeting with Jim (Bruce Thomas) and Violet Stanton (Kristen Dalton) on their farm, Angie is hired to watch over their young son Sam (Kai Caster).  On the designated night, Angie's friend Rick (Matt Dallas) drops her off at the farm and, she and Sam settle in for a quiet evening.  Unfortunately the peace is broken by a series of strange phone calls, and then a man breaks into the house with murderous intent.

Babysitter Wanted features a shift in direction that's slightly out of left field, but things quickly refocus, and the story then follows a pretty conventional path, heavy on the black humor, and with a decent amount of gore, as the Stanton's do their utmost to be good parents to their son.  There are some issues with what happens, particularly regarding an overzealous clergyman, but the film still manages to hold together fairly well.  The acting performances are pretty solid, with Bruce Thomas leading the way, and Kai Caster making a pretty creepy little kid.

The film isn't particularly impressive looking on Bluray, and the bonus features consist mostly of a couple of short bonus featurettes including cast interviews, and trailers, so the single disc DVD version may suffice for most.",1355702400,,1663,4.914285714285715

The idea behind the film is the kind of idea me and my friends would come up with as kids for a good horror movie......Also  the perfect type of story you could tell to your little brothers and sisters when the parents were out....Good old  times.....

But Angie's first night of work might just be her last when she must fight for her life to protect herself and the child. But is everything as it seems?""-  Taken from Amazon's editorial  review.

Angie is about to have a few unexpected surprises as her first night goes..... The acting is perfect, nothing cheesy here. All the performances are believable, both Angie and the Stanton Family deserves a pat on the back for their acting. The cinematography is excellent, even in the darker scenes at night and inside the house. The film is moving, both emotionally and structurally moving.... all the way.... until the end.

There are some plot twists and Sarah Thompson does a decent job but really there's nothing really interesting or worth seeing here.

The film seems to exist in its own world where college students don't own cell phones (but stalkers do), community colleges have dorms and people travel across the country to go to a community college.  And there's no internet, if you want to buy a second-hand bed or a job you look at hand-written notes on a bulletin board.  I can't figure out if the producers wanted this to be set in the 70s or if they just don't quite know how the world works.

There are few thrills, the cover is much gorier than anything you'll see in the film.

4084299,4,B0038AMVV0,"Angie is a poor college student takes on a babysitting gig at a remote farmhouse in order to pay for her school expenses. What starts as a quiet evening turns into the night from hell when she begins receiving suspicious phone calls from a mysterious stalker. BABYSITTER WANTED is a strong independent Slasher film that suffers tremendously from having been released in the same year as HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, considering that they are nearly shot-for-shot the exact same film. From the basic plotting and devilish twist to the vintage 80's aesthetic, it is frightening how similar the two truly are. Despite the fact, BABYSITTER WANTED shares many of the same strengths as Ti West's film. Jonas Barnes and Michael Manasseri have successfully created a spooky atmosphere and oppressive mood that builds up to what eventually becomes a brutal and graphic Slasher. The babysitting theme calls back to other genre classics like BLACK CHRISTMAS or WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, where common household noises and the fear of being alone tap into universal terrors the audience can relate to. Just past the half-way point, the entire direction of the film shifts, and girls are found hung, gutted, and dismembered as Angie struggles to survive. Sarah Thompson is excellent in the role of the sweet and unassuming girl next door, and brings a sincerity and authenticity to her performance. If BABYSITTER WANTED had only been released a year earlier, it may have had a much larger impact on Horror audiences, but that should not keep anyone from picking up this dark and mean-spirited film.

4084303,3,B0038AMVV0,"If you like sensing a stalker, there is some suspense for you at the beginning of this movie as an innocent young college student finds herself in some increasingly ominous surroundings. If you like raw slasher action, you'll get plenty of that as the movie devolves into being a real cut-up. I'm not sure that the turn the plot takes validates all the carnage. It is so misogynistic and brutal in parts, that a viewer can only maintain a charitable view of human nature by taking the imaginings projected on screen here as being campy.

However, you might find the most interesting part of this DVD to be the commentary. This bonus feature is hidden among the ""Set-Up"" options. It's worth checking out for a variety of reasons. The film's directors and its star kick back in an air of jocular, slightly intoxicated ease, and offer their views on the movie's action and on life in general.

Listening to this commentary is like being invited to a college frat party. But it also can painlessly provide an interesting sociological study. It's a good example of how men and women view violence against women differently. While still keeping in the easy-going spirit of the gathering, Sarah Thompson reminds the directors how she had stipulated that she would star in this film only on condition that it would not include any blatantly exploitative shots of women being mutilated. She chided the men about clearly NOT having lived up to their promises in that regard. She also mentions that members of PETA would probably appreciate this film because it shows the horror of what it's like to be butchered. Directors Manasseri and Barnes don't quite seem to get Thompson's point on this score.

The men did think Thompson was being contradictory when, on the one hand, she objected to the graphic violence against women, but on the other hand, thought there was too LITTLE nudity in the film. Thompson kept correcting that she just thought it was illogical that a woman would be allowed to retain her underwear while being sawed up. While that expedient might have been necessary in order for the film to avoid dropping from an ""R"" rating all the way down to the restrictive NC-17 rating - the men still thought Thompson was advocating for more nudity rather than simply pointing out a logical inconsistency.

So the commentary provides a lively jousting between young men and women, an insight into the kinds of misunderstandings and conflicting sensibilities that exist between men and women - before the final cut.",1279756800,45,2513,4.8508158508158505

The directing and acting on this film were very good.  It was a bit bloodier in parts than I cared for, but for the most part it was a tight thriller/suspense/action movie.

Without giving anything away, Babysitter Wanted features some genuine surprises and twists to be had, but sadly the film loses most of its steam towards the end, and the build-up in the beginning of the film is a little too drawn out for its own good.  Still though, Babysitter Wanted delivers most of the goods that horror fans are looking for here, and in that respect alone, it's worth a look.",1277078400,3,839,4.573333333333333
4084309,3,B0038AMVV0,"There have been some number of ""babysitter in peril"" movies and there seems to be no end in sight. So how do you keep things moving forward and fresh? Check this puppy out and you might have your answer.

A very religious girl leaves home for college and picks up a babysitter job for some extra cash. She's a bit skittish to begin with and when things start to go south, and they do go way south, during her first night with the kid, she can barely hold on. Fear not though viewer, she manages to muster up some guts and see things through to the end.

Early on in the film I wasn't that impressed. Not much new was happening and they had something going that was way too obvious (or so I thought). So when the worm turned (and I won't spoil things) it really caught my interest and got me going.

The acting was decent pretty much all the way around. There is a scene between the dad and the babysitter that is worth the price of admission all by itself. The production values were good enough to not let the bones show, and the storyline was genuinely decent. There was some cheapness in the proceedings such as when the babysitter scrambles for a weapon while being pulled back by her attacker. We've seen that way too many times in movies. And the music score was genuinely terrible. But overall this is a worthwhile watch. If I could I'd give this another half star, so if you're at all inclined toward this sort of thing, go for it.",1276905600,4,1439,4.302583025830258
8391193,3,B0038AMVV0,"It was an awesome idea but fell short with the writing. This had so much potential and if written correctly could even have gone for a sequel. The writing is bland, the acting is better than most b movies, the story is interesting enough to keep you interested. That being said, it's still open for a sequel if only with better writing and acting.",1519257600,,347,4.4375
