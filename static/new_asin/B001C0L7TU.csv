8285532,5,B001C0L7TU,"Based on a series of short stories written by Japanese author Natsume Sseki in 1908, this film doles out each story to a different director for a short 7 to 13 minute film.

The stories are very dream-like with a logic structure from dreams so it's hard to explain the ""plot"". In one a writer's wife announces she is leaving after living with him for a hundred years. Another has a samurai being taunted by a drunk monk. Another has a man carve a block of wood by dancing before a motley crew of weirdos. And it goes on.

Anthology films are by nature a mixed bag but this one is very even in term of quality. None of the segments are terrible or even just bad. Some are better but the worst is still very good. Each director brings their own style to their segment. Some are spooky, some are funny and some are just plain weird. Of particular note is the very strange first segment by director Akio Jissoji, one of his last directorial jobs. The beautiful animated seventh dream by Final Fantasy designer Yoshitaka Amano and the final darkly comic dream by cult director Yudai Yamaguchi are standouts as well although other segments are noteworthy in their own ways.

One of the best anthology films I've seen recently. If you are looking for a storyline go elsewhere but for a rewarding walk in dreamtime this is an excellent choice. Recommended.",1523923200,,1348,4.539094650205762

Film = three (3) stars overall; special effects = four (4) stars overall; cinematography = three (3) stars overall; lighting = three (3) stars overall; subtitles = two (2) to three (3) stars depending.  This is a fascinating collection of shorts (each around 10 minutes in duration) derived from an early 20th Century anthology of the same name with 11 directors (some of whom wrote their own scripts and often used different cinematographers).  Among other burning questions answered in this pot of photo-plays is what pigs dream of (and it's not flying!) as well as what silent movies might have come to look like if color and sound were never invented.  Not surprisingly, these mini movies are linked in a number of ways including: similarities in dialogs; the dreamer is always a male; plot lines fixate on past events; and there is a shared fear (maybe hatred?) of children.  (Director Atsushi Shimizu also tries to sort of tie things together in a brief prologue and epilogue.)  These are more nightmares than dreams and, true to the form we all know well, start in the middle of things and end abruptly.
THE FIRST NIGHT (DAIICHIYA).  Three (3) stars; Director = Akio Jissoji.  At the end of a hundred-year marriage, a dying wife asks the dreamer to bury her with a pet goldfish recently deceased as a result of being dropped bowel and all.
THE SECOND NIGHT (DAINIYA).  Two (2) stars; Director = Kon Ichikawa.  A nothing burger (but with an interesting desk clock) shot silently in black and white complete with inter-title cards!
THE THIRD NIGHT (DAISANYA).  Three (3) stars; Director = Takashi Shimizu.  Scary with a child monster clinging to the back of the dreamer.
THE FOURTH NIGHT (DAIYONYA).  Two (2) stars; Director = Atsushi Shimizu .  A nothing burger involving children at play who seem a bit sinister, and a towel that refuses to change into a snake.
THE FIFTH NIGHT (DAIGOYA).  Three (3) stars; Director = Keisuke Toyoshima (who is also credited as screen writer).  A women riding bareback through the night racing to do, well, something before first light.  (Nice horse.)
THE SIX NIGHT (DAIROKUYA).  Two (2) stars; Director = Matsuo Suzuki (who is also credited as screen writer).  A poorly choreographed music video well past it's ""sell-by"" date.  Subtitles = two (2) stars; they are hard to see with white backgrounds due to poor choice of text color and font.
THE SEVENTH NIGHT (DAINANAYA).  Two (2) stars; Directors =Yoshitaka Amano and Masaaki Kawahara.  A pointless, amine with blurry drawings and total gibberish as dialog!
THE EIGHT NIGHT (DAIHACHIYA).  Barely three (3) stars; Director =Nobuhiro Yamashita .  The dreamer uses a mirror to watch events behind his back while searching for a goldfish seller.
THE NINTH NIGHT (DAIKYUYA).  Three (3) stars; Director = Miwa Nishikawa (who is also credited as screen writer).  The dreamer (in a dream told to him in a dream) as a child is tied with a leash to a temple pillar inside of which he catches glimpses of his father who died during WW I (or maybe it was WW II?).
THE TENTH NIGHT (DAIJUYA).  Three (3) stars; Director = Yuudai Yamaguchi (who is also credited as co-screen writer).  Clarifies what pigs (especially female ones) long to literally devour (answer: overly handsome men!).
A mixed bag, but surreal fun overall.  Recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1518307200,,3502,4.901360544217687

8285538,4,B001C0L7TU,"Based on renowned Japanese writer Natsume Soseki's same-titled short story collection, 'TEN NIGHTS OF DREAMS' brings ten phantasmagoric dream sequences by eleven directors to film with great visual and psychological panache. Representing these combined efforts, this outstanding arthouse anthology delves into the surreal subconscious with ten wildly imaginative, reality-subverting visions that range from the wonderful, the absurd to the nightmarish. Not all are equally good, some are a head and shoulder above others, but all are worth viewing. Some of the directors are Akiko Jissoji (RAMPO NOIR, THE PROSPERITIES OF VICE), Takashi Shimizu (THE GRUDGE), Miwa Nishikawa (YURERU), Nobuhiro Yamashita (LINDA LINDA LINDA), Yudai Yamaguchi (BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL) and Atsuchi Shimizu (THE WISH). Recommended, at some point while viewing you'll probably say to yourself, ""I had a dream like this..."".",1275955200,9,898,5.9689922480620154
