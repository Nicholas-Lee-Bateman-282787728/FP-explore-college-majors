7899716,5,7204096711,"I found a mint copy of this box-set buried in the back room of a big consignment thrift shop in downtown Cedar Point, Ohio. I asked the old lady working the sales box (just a box with a lid with money in it) how much it was, and she said ""Oh, you don't want this. It won't play on your machine."" I explained I have a region-free player, and asked her again how much she wanted for it. She said ""One dollar OK?"" I gave her a five and told her to keep it. She was very happy. So was I! I later found a receipt from Amazon in the DVD box, and this gives one the impression that some poor soul in Ohio bought it without any knowledge of region coding. All they knew was ""Dang! This doesn't work!"" Region coding is a greed-based crime and it should be eliminated (it should never have been allowed in the first place). Also, it messes up how foreign VHS / DVD play. It's just a mess for everybody.",1403049600,,892,4.045197740112994
7899717,5,7204096711,"Simon Templar, aka ""The Saint"", was a man with a notorious and mysterious past, who quite often found himself in the middle of adventure and intrigue.  Author Leslie Charteris created The Saint, and when ITC Entertainment began producing the TV series in 1962, Charteris had already been writing Saint adventures for over thirty years.  Simon Templar, the ""Robin Hood of Modern Crime"", was a man never comfortable with accepting authority.  Motivated by his own sense of justice, he had no qualms about taking the law into his own hands.  His travels took him many places, including the Europe, Latin America, Africa as well as his native Great Britain.

Roger Moore was the ideal choice to play The Saint.  Besides being the proper age, and having an athletic physique, Moore possessed class, charm and a dry witty sense of humor.  Even more importantly, he brought an air of irreverence and swagger that are essential to the role of ""Simon Templar"".

The Saint: The Complete Monochrome Series is a Region 2 release, by Network, and Granada Television, that contains 71 episodes from the first four seasons of the series, from 1962 through 1965.  ""Monochrome"" is of course, the English term for black and white.  After the series transitioned to color in 1966, 47 additional episodes were produced.

Charteris' original stories were the primary source material for the initial 71 episodes.  The Saint gets involved in adventure in a myriad of ways, and there is great diversity in these episodes, which feature some well known guest stars of the era, including a large number of attractive starlets, including Julie Christie, Shirley Eaton, Samantha Eggar, and Jane Asher.  With Charteris himself providing some oversight of the scripts, these episodes nicely capture the essence of Simon Templar.  Fleshed out as necessary for television, these tales are mostly fairly faithful adaptations of Charteris' stories.  Although the literary Templar could be quite ruthless when necessary, with rare exceptions like ""The Saint Plays with Fire"", the darker side of Templar's character is mostly kept under wraps on television.

The Saint is a man of the world, with a notorious past, whose unique sense of morality and zest for life, often gets him involved intrigue and adventure.  The perfectly cast Moore, is simply brilliant as Templar.  Confident, cultured, and ever the debonair gentleman, the Saint is capable of decisive action when necessary.  Independently wealthy, yet completely down to earth, Simon Templar is at home anywhere in Europe, mingling in the highest levels of society, relaxing on the Riviera, sunning in the Bahamas, or cruising down the country roads of Britain.  Like the cinematic James Bond, he's the kind of man that most men admire, and most women dream about.  Roger Moore (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ffolkes/dp/B00009AOBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ffolkes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Persuaders/dp/B000JBXHI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Persuaders!</a>) would go on to play James Bond, in seven feature films.

Produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman, and with music by Edwin Astley, The Saint is one of the finest series produced by ITC Entertainment during the 1960's.  The episodes in this set, brilliantly capture the buccaneer spirit of Leslie Charteris' iconic character.  The transfers to DVD are excellent, with the 71 episodes spread across 18 discs.  Extras include image galleries on each disc, with photos from the various episodes, commentary tracks on several episodes, and episode guides with substantial write-ups regarding each episode.  The British do show a remarkable level of devotion that is sorely lacking in most American releases.

After releasing the 47 color episodes in Region 1, A&E released two sets of the ""Early Years"" of the Saint in 2005, containing 28 black and white episodes.  These sets have since been discontinued, and have soared in price.  The Saint Monochrome Series, contains these same 28 episodes, plus 43 additional episodes.  You will of course need a region free DVD player to view Region 2 discs.  The monochrome set is quite pricey, however a better deal can probably be found ordering from Amazon UK.  Check the pound/dollar exchange rate, and look for your best deal.",1356307200,2,4351,5.457399103139013
7899718,5,7204096711,"I am very impressed with the regular definition DVD quality of this set,and it's bonus extras too,the t.v.episodes have never looked or sounded better,and are more complete because they are commercial free as well. The added bonus features(audio commentaries during episides,photo galleries,a documentary,etc.)are first rate too,I highly recommend this set,but wish it was also released to REGION 1 FORMAT-(U.S.A./CANADA),maybe it will be some day hopefully.",1323561600,,458,6.061538461538461
7899719,5,7204096711,"This is the Saint the way it should be. The production values at first are poor but the screen plays are firt rate. Some of the recuring guest stars are the best part of the series. Viencet Price,George Sanders and Roger Moore Make the Saint one of the longest lasting adventure series. Because this is a PAL (region 2)you may need to buy a PAL DVD player.",1323302400,,356,4.3283582089552235
7899720,5,7204096711,"A great compilation of the original B&W series of Simon Templar. Although for Europe, I have a hacked cheap dvd player that plays that zone. Good booklet. Basic casing. I haven't reviewed the extra features yet, but they look a bit light. Very happy with the set. It is what it says it is, all steak, no sizzle, and tha's fine with me.",1285372800,10,335,4.333333333333333
