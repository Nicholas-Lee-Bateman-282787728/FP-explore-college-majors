7513336,5,B017RR6YJE,"I had enjoyed all eight of the previous Jesse Stone movies and was really disheartened when I heard that the movie series had been dropped by its network.  Then, earlier this year, I discovered Hallmark Channel had picked up the series and, while I was extremely happy to hear the movies would be continued, I was also concerned that having the show on Hallmark might have an effect on how the movies would be scripted and filmed going forward.  While I'm a big fan of Hallmark, I generally look to the channel for family entertainment for all ages while I consider the Jesse Stone series to be geared toward a more mature audience (adults and teens who can deal with the concepts involved in murder mysteries.)

I can happily report that Lost in Paradise follows in the same tradition as all of the earlier movies.  While it involved a fairly easily solved mystery, or as Jesse states towards the end of the movie:  Some cases are hard, some are easy.  This one was easy, it was a great re-entry point for the series.

I really appreciated that the movie acknowledged the two year period between this and the last movie.  It seems that a considerable amount of change has happened to Jesse during that two year period and, because of the changes, Jesse is at a brink in his life.  Some of his behaviors have improved while others have deteriorated.  (It wouldn't be a Jesse Stone movie if life had been lollipops and rainbows.)  Still, because of the most moving of the changes in his life which involves the loss of his conscience, Jesse becomes involved in solving a cold case for the Boston PD.  He also becomes involved with helping a young teenager try to get her life straight back in Paradise.

Tom Selleck once again steps into the role of Jesse Stone like it is a well-fitting glove.  He has a certain demeanor that surfaces in this series that I haven't seen in his other roles.  It was wonderful to revisit some of the other characters yet again.  Of course, William Devane was once again outstanding as Dr. Dix, Jesse's interesting and unusual therapist.  Kohl Sudduth as Officer Luther Suitcase Simpson is back as Jesse's primary officer in Paradise and who has the ability to sometimes read Jesse better than Jesse can himself.

Mr. Selleck breathes life into the character I have come to know through the book series.  I understand that he can continue the movie series through the books and beyond.  I appreciate that and look forward to more movies in the future.  This is my husband and my favorite television movie series and we look forward to a new movie every year.  As long as Mr. Selleck continues to film them, we will continue to watch.",1448755200,367,2663,4.6093418259023355

7513461,1,B017RR6YJE,"The series was good up to this point, but now the same old plot shows up...it's a cop who is the bad guy. Ever since The Eyes of Laura Mars in 1978 and before, cops are the dumbbells and the crooks...YAWN...same old plot for 40 years. In this film, call girls are the good guys and a cop not only is the bad guy but he brutally murders women and butchers them while they are still alive.  Why don't we ever see the REAL butchers portrayed in Hooeywood films? Oh, because that's politically incorrect for the real crooks to be portrayed as villains. Let's look at the whole Jesse Stone series of NINE films...what is the racial makeup of ALL the crooks? If it were anything but what it is there would be heads rolling at the Jesse Stone filming office. They should have ended this series at film eight.  And will we ever see a movie about the real crimes of Hooeywood producers,directors and actors?...not likely... they will be portrayed as cops.",1531094400,,946,4.46242774566474

7513469,3,B017RR6YJE,"Bought it to complete the set, but as the last episode, was a bit disappointed by the plot. By Tom's usual standards it was weak.  SPOILER ALERT:  No explanation of Reggie""s (dog) death.  There was no mystery to the case Jesse begins working on (easy to figure out right from the start)/  Too much dead air with Jesse standing around contemplating his boredom with Paradise, ""Suitcase' "" (Deputy) part was inadequate, as was Dr. Dix's.  Not sure what Jesse's deal with Thelma was all about...was he looking out for her? Stalking her?  The two high points were his exchange with the Paradise teens mother who is a drunk, and his dinner with the nun, but over all it was just a weak story.  Sorry Tom. I love these movies, but this last one was not up to the standards of the others....maybe you were just too busy with Blue bloods to write a decent screenplay.",1529971200,,859,4.503225806451613

7513826,2,B017RR6YJE,"LOST IN PARADISE:

I had always been a HUGE fan of the first seven movies in the JESSE STONE series --I have them all, and up until now, I have enjoyed viewing them all several times.

I  felt number eight, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, was a big disappointment compared to the first seven, but I suppose they can't all be big winners.

After watching LOST IN PARADISE for the third time in about a month, I have only one question:

WHAT HAPPENED???!!

This is the most disappointing movie in the series.  I must have seen a different movie than the one previously rated by the other people viewing the movie.

This movie is not much more than a continuous series of almost unrelated, pasted-together one or two minute cameo appearances of former characters in the JS series:

(Since he has now apparently been written out of the series, there is no actual cameo by Hasty, the former money-laundering mobster and used car salesman, but Jesse does manage to squeeze in a visit to the closed-up, now-crumbling used car lot Hasty used to own and run -- Nice overhead camera angle but boooooring).

Of course, the movie could not really get under way without a quick cameo visit with Doctor Dix after two years of absence. There will be another quickie visit with Dr D later on in the movie.

With Hasty missing from the scene, the town of Paradise is unacceptably quiet, and Jesse must again go to the Boston PD to stop himself from being bored.  He makes a visit to Lt Sydney Greenstreet (now acting State Homicide Commander), where he gets a chance to pick and choose from several still-active homicide case files.  He chooses a somewhat mysterious BPD case that is odd because in spite of overwhelming evidence, three-time confessed prostitute serial killer Richard Steele refuses to admit he committed a fourth prostitute murder.  After all, we all know all those serial killers have ethics.

Additionally, Jesse also manages to find time to track down his former love interest, Thelma (in yet another brief cameo), who is still ""singing like an angel.""  Apparently, Thelma has previously bailed out on Jesse, and she is now back to seeing her ex again.  (Unfortunately for Jesse, he will later verify this by stalking Thelma after-hours and seeing her get into what is presumably her ex's car).

Jesse then has a short visit from Luther 'Suitcase' Simpson.  Not to worry, Suitcase will make another couple of very quick appearances later.

Jesse, of course, finds yet another wayward, school-skipping, pot-smoking, 13-year-old teenage girl he will try to help along the way.  The teen, Jenny, is being abused by her alcoholic mother.

Let's be sure not leave out another abbreviated dinner date scene with Sister Mary John.

Obviously, the cameo series would not be complete without a quick visit to Gino Fish and the very lovely Amanda.

Reggie (Jesse's now-deceased dog and confessed conscience) is gone, and has been replaced by a spaghetti-eating Irish Setter named Steve.

Don't worry -- Jesse will, of course, solve the case in the end, and still get to shoot and kill the real bad guy -- No big surprises there.

That's pretty much the whole movie, except in the end, Jesse delivers the wayward teenage girl, Jenny, to Sister Mary at the St Agnes Refuge.

There's not much real believable emotion in the movie, and absolutely none of the very clever in-depth dialog that was always present in the previous movies of the series.  Mr Selleck should stop writing, and stick to acting -- It's what he does best.

If you are as big a fan of the first seven movies of the series as I am, do yourself a favor and skip BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT and LOST IN PARADISE.",1517702400,,3654,4.719242902208202

7513982,5,B017RR6YJE,"Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone is a character that comes along once in a decade. You don't ever want him to go away.  He becomes a flawed but faithful friend. There is magic in this series. Brilliant writing, perfect casting. When Molly went away (I first saw Viola Davis in this series) I lamented, ""What will they do?""  I hate it when characters change. I'll tell you what they did. They did Kathy Baker as Rose Gammon.  A more perfect move could not have been made. I have loved her for years!  From episode to episode, the casting has been excellent, from Mike Starr (a personal friend) to Stephen Baldwin to Mimi Rogers to Robert Carradine, all I can say is WOW!  The characters could be Seal Team Six: there's not a weak one in the batch!
I hope this casting director got an Emmy somewhere along the way.  This series is the perfect storm; the stars and planets are aligned.  Buy these. Buy them all. You will watch them over and over. When I suffer from ""There's nothing ON"" syndrome, I pop in a Jesse Stone DVD.  With this series, there's ALWAYS ""something on.""",1510099200,,1065,4.425641025641026

If you plan to order them all you need to know the correct order which pertains to Jesse's arrival in Paradise and other character progression. Order: 1- Night Passage 2- Stone Cold 3-Death In Paradise 4- Sea Change 5- Thin Ice 6- No Remorse  7- Innocents Lost 8- Benefit Of The Doubt 9- Lost In Paradise. The cast is well chosen, the acting well done and the plots interesting.  The scenery is beautiful and the music haunting and well suited to the series.

7514208,3,B017RR6YJE,"Let me begin by saying that I love the Jesse Stone series and that I watch the full series periodically. This was the worst of the nine movies. The acting was fine if forced at times; my guess is that this is a result of a very thin script without any character development. The plot arc was visible but not executed, and the script seemed to just rip off all the basic scenes that define the Jesse Stone character. We learned nothing new about Jesse Stone from this movie and there were tons of opportunity in the plot line because it revolved around all of his character's triggers: a girl and family in distress, a corrupt cop, and a victim who could not have been saved by standard justice. It even had a villain protected by society. However, none of this was developed. Through the movies, he has managed to move on from his ex to a degree and start seeing other woman, he recovered from the death of his dog by connecting with the dog he originally rescued, which they killed off for this movie for some reason. He has even found family in the people of the town, the shrink, the state homicide group, the nun, and the criminal with scruples and his people. None of this is perfect which is why he still drinks. And that is the resolution that these movies--stories--are seeking. ""Fate"" will not leave him in his despair; that is what he believes and what we are all watching and waiting and hoping for for Jesse. He could have found something of it in this plot, but this movie did not seem to be interested in advancing Jesse Stone's character. And, why didn't we see the inside of the police station in this? I gave this three stars because I like the series and want to see it recover, and because at the end of the day, I like my Scotch on the rocks while watching a slow, hard-boiled detective movie and it delivers something of that.",1504483200,,1847,4.387755102040816

Conspicuously absent was Captain Healy, whose accent and demeanor add legitimacy to the Massachusetts setting. Also absent was a love interest.  I particularly like Thelma Gleffey, who had inexplicably reconciled with her ex who had previously gone ""wherever his penis pointed"". Lt. Sydney Greenstreet, a reasonable alternative, was there but only at arm's length. And Rose Gammon needs to overcome her gremlins and get back to work.

7514391,4,B017RR6YJE,"A good continuation of the series, though I would suspect another writer might have been involved. Some of the dialogue motifs were picked up from the earlier movies, but there were a couple of flawed lines in the interior monologue. One occurred early that set my teeth on edge, and I couldn't help but wait for more. When Jesse visits the grave of his old friend (I won't spoil the story by telling whose grave it was), he utters a line that was unworthy of the dialogue of previous movies.

On another occasion, Jesse visits another former lover. Their conversation and interplay was stilted and slightly corny, and unworthy of the self-deprecating Jesse Stone.

That sounds harsher than I'd like. It WAS a good movie and generally true to the characters as established in earlier episodes.",1499731200,,793,4.823529411764706

The series is a character drive look at a small town with issues and a guy from the big city who also has issues. You will like Jesse from the beginning but after some time you'll also get to know him better than he knows him. It's kinda slow but that's in keeping with the theme of the small town low key pace of the setting. That's what makes the crimes more real and fun to follow.

7514714,3,B017RR6YJE,"After a while the tired formula gets, well, really old and tired. And that's exactly how this installment comes across. Old, tired people repeating the same old, tired lines we hear in just about every other Jesse Stone movie. I'm not trying to be rude here. I absolutely LOVE these movies. I've seen each of them at least ten times a piece which is why it's even more disappointing that even with a new installment and some differences in plot and character adjustments, et al, it is still the same Jesse Stone movie we've seen a dozen times over. I'll watch it several times more anyway and I'll try not to cringe at some of the standard formula text and character non-developments. One of which is quite annoying and that is, every woman, no matter age, background, mindframe, current status, etc is madly in love with Jesse Stone although looking at the state of him and the exhausted monotony of scripted verse he delivers, it really is puzzling anymore what's there to be madly in love with. When he meets with the prisoner, nothing screams ""this guy knows what he's doing,"" and yet the scripted lines adhere to that viewpoint. He just looks over it. Like maybe even making a movie about a tired cop made Tom extra tired and it came through a little harder and more obvious than it should have. I miss several of the characters whom did not appear in this installment. If they do make another one, I truly hope they can get a little bit more out of the box with their overdone basics. By now, the ""let's review"" items can be viewed in previous episodes. By the way.. the ""who did it"" ... come on guys. Can we get a little more creative?",1489968000,,1642,4.476666666666667

7515046,5,B017RR6YJE,"Five RELENTLESS Stars. Jesse Stone movie fans are in for yet another treat. This is the 9th edition of the 9 movies centered on Jesse Stone, the troubled police chief of the small seaside town of Paradise, Massachusetts, based on the popular novels of author Robert B. Parker. Hopefully, more will come from Hallmark TV channel. In this movie starring Tom Selleck as Jesse, he is both bored and troubled as he explains in a discussion with his shrink in the beginning, laying the ground work for going to Boston to do some heavy-duty police work. In Boston, he gets his pick of certain cases and, in his peculiar, relentless way, the chase is on. But as usual, there is a parallel storyline to be worked. Co-starring Kohl Sudduth, Gloria Reuben, Leslie Hope, William Sadler, Amelia Rose Blaire, Alex Carter, Mackenzie Foy, Al Sapienza, Kerri Smith, Christine Tizzard, Dawn Greenhalgh, Vickie Papavs, Ned the dog, with Luke Perry and William Devane. Music by Jeff Beal. Produced by Steven Brandman. Directed by Robert Harmon. Five PECULIAR Stars. (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment CD. Brandman Productions, Inc. TWS Productions II, Inc. NR. Color.

7515149,4,B017RR6YJE,"Excellent movie; but, I missed the old Paradise crowd. Interesting to note that the movies are based on the original Robert B. Parker novels but as more movies developed they wandered farther and farther away from Parker's' story line until they had little resemblance to each other. Now that a new writer, Reed Farrel Coleman is writing the actual books new conflicts are coming into play between the movies and books, one of them irreconcilable. It seems that both the books and the movie are moving further and further away from the town of Paradise and its players a fact I find very disappointing. Still I found the movie very entertaining and Tom Selleck's acting fantastic as usual. Return of the dog was a plus.",1483833600,,719,4.76

7515340,5,B017RR6YJE,"It is great to see Tom Selleck thru his career grow in acting, remember The Rockford Files Lance White? Now a producer and writer, and good solid dramatic actor, in a mature adult role with problems, passions, and above all the professional pursuit of being a plodding police investigator. Lots of talent in rest of cast, William Devane is fantastic! And the actress's in their varied roles of night club singer/diva, alcoholic, abused teen, nun and the police boss assigning Jessie to cold cases in Boston. Only Suitcase, the Paradise town policeman, is in this episode (other episodes had a capable staff including Suitcase under Jesse as police dept. chief) because Jesse is a ""consultant"" contractor to the Boston PD and not Chief of the Paradise Police Department. He may have been fired from his job, but he keeps plodding, doing what he does best, and even gets a buddy (a shelter dog that the murdered women had in the cold case he is reviewing) who he helps and mans best friend helps him thru dark times. And the  screenplay has sharp, witty, social satire that is balanced with dramatic scenes, brilliant. Lots of scenes have no dialogue, just excellent acting, direction, setting that tells the story. And scenes using no dialogue with Jesse in his home or reflecting on situations reinforces the character of Jesse as a single adult man. And above all the flaws that Jesse has, he helps people.",1479427200,,1407,4.81404958677686

7515347,5,B017RR6YJE,"It was 2 years since the last one and I was glad to see that Hallmark picked up this franchise. I felt that it was the same good quality of character and story that was present throughout the series. I really like this series because it shows how people, even in their own weak moments, can make a difference in their world surroundings. I am so glad that Jesse has a new buddy to replace Reggie. That canine character is, as Jesse put it,"" his conscience"" even in his silence. He forces Jesse to do that deep soul searching that he needs to do to keep getting up everyday and putting one foot in front of the other, even when he feels like there's no use. I look forward to the next installment which I think comes out next year.",1478995200,,730,4.2214285714285715

The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't use the same original music they used for all the others and it COMPLETELY changed the feel of the movie.  Even though the music is written by the same composer, the movie lost something by not sticking to the original.  Jesse Stones original soundtrack is just like what John Williams is to JAWS.
Please go back to the original music in the next movie!!!",1474329600,,459,4.376470588235295
7515593,5,B017RR6YJE,This series is peerless. I own and watch them over and over again. IMHO the Jesse Stone movie series is a faithful rendering of the character in the Parker books. The latest in the series offers even more intriguing views into the sensitivity of the character and how this character evolves as he ages using wisdom and tenderness where and whenever possible. I miss some of the older characters but continuing to see some of my most favorite ones gives me hope that they will continue.,1474329600,,485,4.651162790697675

It has a good story line and I really got enjoyment of seeing a second time where I missed a few things here and there that really pull the story together.  Nevertheless, I purchased this along with all of the other Jesse Stone movies since I really don't think there will be anything like it in the future with the way TV and Movies are made for today's younger audiences.

7515733,4,B017RR6YJE,"Jesse Stone fans will be relieved to know that this unique franchise, which had been in suspended animation over the past two years, lives on and is mostly intact in this, its ninth episode. Some, but not all, of the recurring supporting actors are back, as is the spare but witty dialogue, the character studies and the leisurely cinematic pacing showing off its fine photography, all of which sets this series apart.
One disappointment is the loss of focus on life in Paradise, a small Massachusetts coastal tourist town where Jesse Stone, a recovering alcoholic, has been struggling throughout the series to hold onto his job as police chief. Most of the attention is on Boston, where Stone is helping the state police homicide department close one of its open cases.
Here this episode sorely misses the contribution of Stephen McHattie, who had been the state homicide unit commander in previous installments. His replacement by a slim female detective named Sydney Greenstreet (wink,wink), who does not get along well with the Jesse character, only highlights the loss of the chemistry between Selleck and McHattie.
Nevertheless, the return of Jesse Stone is still a cause for celebration, despite the caveats mentioned above. It is a worthy addition to the series.",1469664000,,1270,5.08133971291866

7515859,5,B017RR6YJE,"These  TV movies have the quality of fine films. Music, cinematography, direction and acting are all superb.  One of the rare cases where the movies are better than the books. After all, Robert B Parker had Jesse Stone living in a condo!!
Big fan of Tom Selleck. A fine actor who has the successful career that he richly deserves.
I have to admit, though, I would love to hear him say, just once, for old times' sake: ""Come on, guys!""
Gotta question: Why no Emmy nominations? Or is the board who makes the nominations just crazy?",1466899200,,529,4.5
7515860,5,B017RR6YJE,"Actually, 4.5 stars...but after I watch Lost in Paradise a few more times, I might like it all the way to 5 stars.  A long time ago I decided that Tom Selleck's Jesse Stone is actually better than the Jesse in the novels.  An older Jesse works better for me because at age 35, there isn't enough personal history to have Jesse so set in his ways and so troubled by his character (both good and bad in conflict).  Also, the younger Jesse in the novels had not achieved quite as much expertise as Selleck's Jesse.  Then, too, Jesse as a cat lover doesn't do it for me...it's gotta be a dog...an outdoor dog.  As much as I liked Robert B. Parker's stories and writing style, I have to admit that I have come to favor Selleck's Jesse Stone even more than the original.  This addition to the series is as good, if not better, than its predecessors, and I look forward to another.",1466899200,,874,4.298780487804878

7515862,5,B017RR6YJE,The tone is very similar to that of the other films in ths series as Jesse Stone deals with his inner demons and solves a crime by finding the guilty person who is not the expected person. If you liked the others you will enjoy this one. Do not expect car crashes or exciting chases. These films are more cerebral. The characters are well developed and the film concentrates on how the leading character and his companions solve crimes and how the leading character interacts with others in the town. If you have read the books you will find that the films are only very loosely based on them. I have enjoyed all of the Jesse Stone films and this one is no exception.,1466812800,,667,4.387096774193548

7515902,5,B017RR6YJE,"Tom Selleck shows his chops in the Paradise series in a way never available to him in Blue Bloods. Jesse Stone is a nearly burned out cop on his last chance at life job. Damaged and hanging on in powerful determination, Selleck's portrayal is both haunted and haunting. The stories are engaging and stand alone perfectly well as mysteries in a series. But there is no way to view just one of these stories any more than one could view just one Perry Mason. ( Not that they have any thing to do with each other. )  This is tasteful, adult TV drama at its best and they stand up to repeat viewings the same way you go back to visit old friends. We can only hope for more titles added to the list on a semi-regular basis.  I hate to say it, but it is true. Tom Selleck IS Jesse Stone.",1466294400,,781,4.131578947368421

7515946,5,B017RR6YJE,"For those of us on the other side of the Pond, its been nigh on three years since the last Jesse Stone movie  Benefit of the Doubt  and I have to say, as far as Im concerned, the wait was well worth it. Great to see Selleck return in the role hes made his own. OK, so hes way way older than the Jesse Stone as portrayed in the novels by Robert B Parker  Sellecks over 70, damn it  but he really has nailed the essence of the character. The pared down script  co-penned by Selleck and his collaborator and co-producer Michael Brandman - could have been written by the great man himself. Theres not a wasted word anywhere. Brandman has attempted a couple of Jesse Stone novels, which I have to say, to my mind, did not capture the feel of the original stories in any shape or form (see my review of the novel: Killing the Blues), but he and Selleck have really done well with the film adaptations.

I suspect that there are viewers who aren't long-time fans who will consider the films to be slow moving with very little action, but they were never meant to be great shoot-em-ups. These are character driven stories and slow burners and in that they excel.

Great to see some of the old crew back as well, in particular the therapist, Dix, Suitcase and Gino Fish. And for those of us who mourned the loss of the wonderful Reggie, Im guessing there have been a few silent cheers and perhaps a tear or two shed to welcome the fact that a worthy successor has been found.

Hard to put into words, but there is something profoundly comforting in watching these films. The moody atmosphere, the location, the short, sharp dialogue or just the fine acting; don't ask me what it is, exactly, because I cant quite put my finger on it. All I know is they're pretty darn terrific.

Selleck has said hed like to produce more Jesse Stone films and on the basis of this welcome return I really hope he succeeds.",1465776000,,1896,4.348441926345609

7515978,5,B017RR6YJE,"All the Jesse Stone cop/mystery videos I've watched to date, 6 of them, have been great. I wasn't really a cop/mystery fan, vids or books, until I watched Tom Selleck and William Devane in this collection. I accidentally found them in my local public library and picked one to fill out my allotted four vid check outs and became an instant convert. Selleck is a fine actor, perfect in his deadpan, serious cop business, glib humor, functioning alcoholic role as Jesse Stone. (Jonny Walker Red Label scotch sales must have gone up as a consequence.) Selleck also directs some of the films. William Devane is also great as a former cop, now retired and a psychiatrist trying to quit smoking - all his life, apparently. He is trying, unsuccessfully, to help Jesse cope with his divorce, the death of his girlfriend and dog - ""Why is this so hard?"". I won't forget Reggie and Steve (Joe, the red Airedale) as his conscience. Robert Parker created the character of Stone in a sub-series of his many books, one of which I am now reading. The vids are generally composites of Parker's Stone stories and there is some redundancy in dialog and storyline, but it isn't really annoying or boring, I only regret I discovered Parker six years after his death in 2010.",1464998400,,1254,4.678733031674208

Started at 9am ..at 11pm .. I was Omg there is more? ..shut the tv off ...

7516049,5,B017RR6YJE,"Jesse Stone is  as tough as they comes when the time to get tough matters, his personal problems are real but it is the way he handles them that makes it easy to relate to him; while many types of crime dramas focus on pure gore, wild chases, and non stop gunfire; this show depends on the slower pace of true life investigation. The series is one of the best of its kind. The series of movies has been out for some time so if you have not experienced it my suggestion would be to gather them all and whenever there is time, commence to viewing.  Take your time and savor the wonderful work Tom Selleck does with these movies.",1462838400,,626,4.208333333333333

The whole Jesse Stone series has a certain ambiance to it. The music score is so ethereal and when I hear the opening theme I'm hooked
and ready to step into Jesse's world.  In this episode, Jesse gets a new buddy. Paradise police chief Jesse Stone takes some well-deserved vacation time and chooses to spend it in Boston, where the Assistant State Homicide Commander, Lieutenant Sydney Greenstreet has sought his expertise in evaluating a packet of cold case murders. His cop-ly intuition leads him to a case that has already been closed, but when something about it catches his eye, it sets him off on an investigation filled with surprises, unlikely suspects and grave danger.",1460678400,,811,4.83453237410072

Long have I been a R.B. Parker fan, and often the book is better than the movie. In this case the movie is better than the book. I was very excited to see this new release and deeply hope that there are more. I recorded it when it first played on TV so I could fast forward through commercials selling items I was not interested in, and wouldn't buy anyway. Now I will add this movie to the rest of my Jesse Stone DVD's. I just shared the first three with a good friend and have created another fan.

Each of these stories is unique in it's telling. To me, this is as good as all of them and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you to Hallmark, Tom Selleck for this great entertainment. This we need more of!",1459209600,,869,4.1726190476190474

That's not necessarily a bad thing. The stories are different enough that you can read the book and then recognize a few scene dialogues in the movie but get a completely different experience. I don't understand why No Doubt is not available in streaming form. All of the other Jesse Stone movies are. You'll have to get the DVD to watch them all. These are all ""made for TV"" movies.

7516253,5,B017RR6YJE,"I was heartbroken when I heard there wouldn't be anymore of these movies. Finally Selleck has found a group (Hallmark!) who let him maintain control and asked for 2 films. Yippee!! Some years have passed and Jesse has done such a good job managing crime in Paradise that work is very quiet, so he heads to Boston to meet a former flame who is in the higher ups of their police force to try and solve some of their cold cases. He picks an unsolved murder of a prostitute - the m.o., is identical to the work of a serial killer already in custody (luke perry) who denies this particular murder (and he likes to take claim for his work!). The added twist, Jesse's ""conscience"", his dog Reggie has died (we see Jesse at his grave). Reggie came to him by way of being abandoned at a crime scene - Jesse took him in and over the course of several films the two learned how to love each other. This murder scene also reveals an abandoned dog who's been shut up in a shelter. Jesses rescues him and helps said dog ""Steve"" recover - the fact he's a ringer for Reggie helps! I'm not going to give the plot away. You should watch it yourself. We see a return of familiar characters-Jesse's therapist, and best of all ""suitcase"" his faithful fellow cop in Paradise (he is working on a different issue while Jesse is in Boston). The show continues to be filmed in Nova Scotia with Halifax subbing for Boston - Jesses lovely red house with its bridge remains (in Lunenburg). Tom Selleck is wonderful. The damaged man with a big heart, he's still struggling with alcohol and his ex wife. I hope there's more than 2 films!!! Enjoy",1457395200,,1614,4.40133779264214

7516322,5,B017RR6YJE,"I just watched Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise last night and am pleased to report that this latest in the Jesse Stone movies is as good as the other films I have seen in this series.

Tom Selleck is the star of the show and he shines in his quiet and competent fashion.  He has some time off from his job in Paradise and decides to assist a colleague in nearby Boston with a cold case.

The usual cast of characters makes an appearance in Lost in Paradise and the always dependable William Devane continues in his role as the crusty psychologist who pushes and prods Jesse to ease back on the heavy drinking that is his trademark in this series of films.

What is best about this new film is that it shows us Jesse at work solving a difficult crime.  He collects one clue after another until he finds and confronts the killer.  This film is cerebral rather than action oriented, and isn't that a welcomed change?  No extended car chases, no violent shoot outs, no screaming, yelling, and carrying on, just competent police work by Tom Selleck, who has found a home with this series and an alter ego with Jesse Stone.

It is time to go back to Night Passage, the first Jesse Stone movie filmed in 1997.  I have seen a few, but not all, of these films.  If those I have not seen are close to the quality found in Lost in Paradise, I will be well pleased.  This is entertainment for adults and I for one appreciate it.",1456876800,,1414,4.2981132075471695

If someone asked me which of the eight was the greatest, I would have to say the eighth in the series, ""Benefit of the Doubt.""  My feeling is that ""Lost in Paradise"" was a bit of a let down from this previous one.  It is still enjoyable for any Jesse Stone fan but most of us want the next one to outdo the previous one.  Such is not the case here. ""Lost in Paradise"" has all the elements we love about Jesse Stone, the town of Paradise and all of its characters but the impact of the plot is a little off.  Missed are Kathy Baker as Rose Gammon and Stephen McHattie as Captain Healy.",1456704000,,713,4.093525179856115

7516422,5,B017RR6YJE,"I'm a big fan of the ""Jesse Stone"" novels and TV movies.  Nobody was happier than I when Hallmark agreed to take over the franchise from CBS and to put the money up for another episode.  Not having the Hallmark Channel, I had to wait for the DVD to eventually come before I could see it.  The purchase turned out to be everything I'd hoped for, and I think this is one of finest of the nine episodes.

It was wonderful seeing my family back in action because that's what they are: My family.  From Robert Harmon, the director of all of the ""Jesse Stone"" television films, to Jeff Beal who does the music for each one, to Michael Brandman for writing the teleplay with Tom Selleck and turning out such a fabulous series, and to the actors who have appear in the many shows from Kohl Sudduth, Gloria Reuben, William Saddler, Christine Tizzard as the breath-taking Amanda, Leslie Hope as Lt. Sidney Greenstreet, and Kerri Smith as the nun with a solid heart of gold.  I definitely missed Stephen McHattie as Lt. Healy from this episode, along with Kathy Baker as Stone's Dispatcher, and Reggie the dog.  On a slightly different note, Leslie Hope took McHattie's position as Head of the State Police, and Leslie is certainly a lovely redhead to gaze one's eyes upon.  Ned the dog also joined the cast and did good.

The story centers around two cases that draw Jesse Stone's attention.  The problem is that Stone has done too good of a job cleaning up Paradise and now has to look elsewhere for challenges as a police officer.  Lieutenant Greenstreet gives Stone a stack of cold cases that are till open.  One draws the small-town cop's curiosity.  Four prostitutes were murdered in the exact same way, but the serial killer only confessed to the first three, claiming the fourth one was done by a copycat.  Jesse also runs into a wayward teenager who's smoking pot on a bench alongside one of the local streets in Paradise.  I think she wanted to get caught.  When Jesse stops and talks to her, he discovers that her mom is an alcoholic.  He decides to add the teenager to his list of people to help.  While all of this is going on, the viewer discovers that Reggie has died, and Jesse makes a visit to the Boston Animal Shelter and rescues Steve the dog, (an Irish Setter) who'd belonged to the fourth murdered prostitute.

Like the other eight episodes, this one also struck a strong cord with me.  I certainly enjoyed the suspense and how Jesse Stone goes about resolving the issues of both cases.  More than that, however, was just being around this wonderful family and feeling at home.  Jesse Stone has faults as a character, but still manages to do the right thing in every instance.  He's a good human being with a lot of heart, and Tom Selleck plays the character to perfection.  All the emotions that Jesse feels can be seen in his eyes, and Tom conveys this aspect of his terrific acting ability one-hundred percent.  You can feel every mood that Jesse experiences through Tom's soulful eyes.  In fact, it wouldn't be too difficult to say that Tom Selleck becomes Jesse Stone whenever he puts on the Paradise Police Department hat.

I should add that there are a good many gorgeous ladies in this episode and will keep the men glued to the screen while the wives or girlfriends get a feel of Tom Selleck at his best.  Remember, this was the man who almost became Indiana Jones.  But, with regards to the ladies, there are: Gloria Reuben, Kerri Smith, Christine Tizzard, who kind of steals the show as Gino Fish's receptionist in her tight dresses, and Leslie Hope as the lovely Lt. Sidney Greenstreet.  Imagined being cuffed by Leslie Hope.  That's a thought that won't go away.  It's Tom's show, so he gets to have all the fun!

This is why the fans of Jesse Stone and Tom Selleck don't want to see the series end.  But, as the old saying goes, ""All good things must eventually end.""  We can only hope (there's that word again) that there will be at least one more Jesse Stone episode and that it goes out with a BIG bang.  Of course, that's the dilemma, isn't it?  How do you stay true to the novels that are still being written and to Bob Parker's memory, while creating something that will have the fans talking for years to come?  I'm glad I'm not the writer of this series.  If everything moves forward, this will be a tough episode to write. No doubt about it!

One last note.  Jeff Beal, who does the music for each episode, put out a limited edition soundtrack of the ""Jesse Stone"" shows a few years ago.  I got my copy.  The music might still be available on Amazon.

Highly recommended to all ""Jesse Stone"" fans out there!",1456012800,6,4641,4.506586826347306

7516428,5,B017RR6YJE,"""I've lost my conscience"". Jesse is in the shrink's office, responding to questions about his drinking. Paradise is quiet. He is bored. Needs a crime to solve. In eerie scenes in the office, on a bridge and on shore, Jesse reprises scenes in past films, but with subtle differences. (Three stars)
A friend in State Homicide has some cold case files, and Jesse looks them over. He chooses that of a serial killer- one who admits to three; so who killed the fourth? The suspect list is short. Taking a different tack, there is a witness who supplies new clues. Oh, by the way, Jesse takes the victim's dog home. You can tell he is a dog lover. (Plus one star)
As usual, there is a solitary troubled person who needs help. We see his own bitter experience enter the conversation; perhaps his act of compassion will change things. (Plus a fifth star)
A number of old characters appear again to add depth to the mystery. Selleck, and Michael Brandman, the writers, have created an enduring image from the Robert B Parker books.
As before, our hero will solve the case(s) his own way.",1455926400,,1078,4.561855670103093

I was surprised to see Mackenzie Foy (Twilight series - Breaking Dawn) in this episode.  I still miss Molly and Rose, but maybe they'll be back for a future installment.

This installment focused not so much on Paradise, but a cold case from Boston.  Leslie Hope is his supervisor instead of Captain Healy (which I missed as I like the Jesse/Healy relationship).  Apparently Jesse has really cleaned up crime in Paradise.  The cold case is a Jack The Ripper style murder mystery.  No spoiler alert here, just know that if you're a fan of this series you'll enjoy this one too.

I own all 9 films; loved the ""cop show for grown-ups"" style in the first 3; with changes in directors a couple of the next ones became more 'downbeat' in tone and not very interesting. But here in ""Lost in Paradise"" we get the slow moving, thoughtful dialogue, tortured, character driven kind of film that drew me to rave about this series back when it started. Tasty cameo's from the characters in JS films you've come to love are all here; William Sadler as Gino Fish the gangster; William Devane as the ex-cop, now therapist, Jesse goes to see;. Kohl Suddath as ""Suitcase"" Jesse's loyal deputy and some others. The plot involves Jesse doing some contract work for Boston PD investigating homicide cases they can't get to cause he's bored in Paradise. Along with solving a tough case, he also helps a young girl with her alcoholic Mom, and we end the film with a shootout with the bad guy. Overall, just a rich, satisfying ""cop show for grown ups"" once again as this film probably most appeals to folks who qualify for AARP (like myself) I'll gladly report it also has subtitles!",1455840000,,1211,4.585253456221198

Some questions didn't get answered or resolved like if Jesse Stone has his LAPD pension and a paycheck from Paradise Police Department then WHY can't he buy his own car? What about Hasty Hathaway? Does he literally get away with murder? And Chief Stone's love life which starts with his unhealthy and even psychotic devotion to a cheating and shallow ex-wife to a gorgeous chanteuse with more relationship issues than Jesse to a professional peer working for the state to a gorgeous and mysterious receptionist and finally to an equally gorgeous NUN.

7516497,4,B017RR6YJE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Tom Selleck has made as big a career out of playing Jesse Stone as he has Thomas Magnum or Frank Ryan. This makes his ninth outing as the character with another one in the works. Its a role that suits him and his style of acting these days. Stone is a lost soul, a man who has given his life to his work in helping others and in finding criminals while at the same time sacrificing his life away from work. Its cost him his family and driven him to alcoholism at times. And still he is the best at what he does, using his brain to sift through what others miss to find solutions.

As the film opens Stone is still mourning the loss of his best friend and sidekick, he dog Reggie. Having solved the biggest crime in Paradise he now has little to do as the top policeman in town. To help cope with his loss and his battles with drinking and loneliness, Stone stops by the office of Lt. Sydney Greenstreet (Leslie Hope), ex-lover and high ranking detective in Boston, to ask for a job helping solve cold cases. Working for no pay but the chance to help, his first case involves that of a serial killer.

Richard Steele (Luke Perry) was convicted of killing three prostitutes and suspected of killing a fourth. But that fourth case remains open and Steele claims he had no part in it. All clues point to his being involved as items from his case not mentioned to the press are apparent with that last victim. While talking about the case with Stone, Steele offers him direction as to finding the real killer. Or is he just toying with Stone?

In addition to trying to solve this case Stone comes across a young girl in Paradise who is troubled. Finding her skipping school and smoking a joint in front of him he offers her some advice and a chance to go to class. Their casual conversation causes him enough concern that he looks into her case and finds she has an alcoholic single mother who is troubled as well. Directing his moral compass he tries to set the youngster on the right path.

There is another smaller side story that is told here as well. The last supposed victim of the serial killer had a dog that Stone tracks down as it is about to be euthanized. It seems the dog hasn't acted the same since his owners death. Rather than let it be put down, Stone takes the dog home and tries to find out what the dog needs. The dogs loneliness mirrors that of Stone and the two are a perfect match, each helping the other to come back to the world.

As with all of the Jesse Stone movies this one moves along slowly but at a deliberate pace. It allows the story to unfold and be told in the actions and thoughts of those involved that are put on display through the actors abilities to convey those stories out via situations and responses as opposed to everything being dialogue. This doesnt make it a silent movie but much can be said about an actors ability to convey emotion with a look or a movement as opposed to just saying Gee I feel depressed.

In a world where most murder mysteries involve car chases and non-stop shootouts this movie lets the story unfold as it might in real life. Any car chases or gunplay is short lived and the movie doesnt depend on them to move the story forward. Instead we are allowed to sift through the clues the same way that Stone is with the hope of finding the guilty party. We get to see that there is a deeply rooted moral and righteous man in the character of Jesse Stone. And in the end were given a solid story and a movie that entertains, intrigues and offers enough drama to keep us watching from start to finish.",1454630400,5,3619,4.305433186490455

Love the Irish Setter Dogs in his movies. The dog added to the solving of the movie gave depth to his part of the continuing story..
Just enough of some of past stories of Jesse Stone's 8 previous movies.
Tom Selleck is very good in what ever movies he acts in, such as ""Blue Bloods"" and ofcourse JESSE STONE.

the bottom line - if you loved the series produced by CBS (which i did), you'll enjoy this, otherwise, it's just another made for TV movie with tom selleck in it with a lot of backstory you won't get.",1454198400,8,937,4.783950617283951

7516540,5,B017RR6YJE,"Lost in Paradise reminds us, again, of how skilled Tom Selleck is when he has a solid script behind him.  In this case TS was partly responsible for that script.

The A and B stories are straightforward.  Jesse is bored with the fact that he has basically cleaned up Paradise.  He hires out (for expenses only) to the Boston homicide division, where he investigates a cold case.  A serial killer has brutalized three women, but denies responsibility for the death of a fourth, who died in precisely the same way as the other three.  The murders have stopped (Jesse is told, again and again), but he continues to seek the perpetrator of the fourth murder.  In the B story, Jesseback in Paradisesees a young girl smoking dope and avoiding going to school.  He takes her under his wing and does what he can for her equally-troubled mother.

On the personal side, Reggie is gone now and Jesse misses him.  When he sees that the fourth victims dog was standing by her side after her death, he tracks him down and adopts him.  Dogs cant talk, his shrink informs him.  No, but they sure can listen, Jesse responds.  The dogs name is Steve and he does everything in his power to steal the show.  I look forward to seeing him again and again in future episodes.

As noted above, the script is sweet and pure; the spare dialogue would make Elmore Leonard and Hemingway weep.  Bob Parker is smiling down on TS and his director, Robert Harmon.  The pacing manages to be both slow and riveting.  This is adult entertainment, character-driven, moody and pitch-perfect.  The gauzy lens helps create the atmospherics.  The ending is very, very satisfying.  Luke Perry is good as the serial killer; William Devane kills the shrinks role, as always; Suit is back.  Jesse is hitting the Johnny Walker red a little too hard but now that he has Steve by his side the clouds are beginning to part.

Welcome back, Jesse.  We missed you.",1454112000,,1913,4.6083086053412465

This one though was well worth the long wait.  The cinematography was beautiful, the music was moving, the story line was great, and the acting was superb from ALL the actors.  In particular, Tom Selleck does an excellent job with all of Jesse's quirks, charms, regrets, toughness, and kindnesses.  It was also great to see many of the other characters from years gone by, especially Suitcase and Dr. Dix.  I must admit, I really missed Rose.  I hope she eventually shows up in any upcoming movies.  I also can't wait to watch Jesse's growing relationship with Steve.

7516550,4,B017RR6YJE,"Jesse Stone: Lost In Paradise is adapted from characters created by the late Robert B. Parker. This ninth installment of the TV franchise is co-written and executive produced by its star, Tom Selleck, as the well-liked cop who helps the Massachusetts State Homicide Division track down a serial killer. A respected law enforcement officer, Stone has a complicated life because of his dependence on alcohol and a shaky relationship with his ex-wife.

With things running smoothly in Paradise, Massachusetts, Police Chief Stone agrees to serve as a consultant on an unsolved murder case in Boston. Local police believe The Boston Ripper (Luke Perry), a killer  already behind bars, is the prime suspect in the murder of the Rippers fourth victim. Stone thinks the murderer is closer to home, setting him off on a dangerous investigation filled with surprises.

The Jesse Stone series is reminiscent of vintage TV cop dramas, and Selleck is a perfect fit for the hard-boiled, flawed cop. There are elements of Columbo, Kojak, Jim Rockford, and even Joe Friday (Dragnet) in Stone, which makes him continually fascinating as he attempts to solve crimes while dealing with his personal demons.

The unrated DVD does not contain any bonus features.",1453420800,3,1241,5.159203980099503
7516551,5,B017RR6YJE,"As another reviewer said, Tom Selleck IS Jessie Stone!  And I complement him on his writing talents for this continuing series that we as fans can't get enough of.  I own every Jesse Stone movie, and will own this one as well.
I too was surprised about Hallmark being the place to find a Jesse Stone movie, but it is every bit as good as the ones that have proceeded it. What we expect from this character is in this movie just as all the others, such as the demons he continues to deal with, including new events that make life interesting.  And I was just pleased that we had another movie to watch the ongoing adventure that is this character.  I hope they will keep it up!  I think they have many avenues they can continue to explore, and from the reviews, you can tell that we as fans want the movies to keep coming!
Tom Selleck proves he knows this character inside out in writing continuing stories and portraying the character.  Yes, I will always miss Robert B Parker and his books, but I think if he were around today, he would complement Mr. Selleck on his tribute to one of Parker's best characters.",1453420800,44,1111,4.368932038834951
7516552,5,B017RR6YJE,"While I am a huge fan of this series, I doubt that I'm alone when it comes to my sole complaint--the repetitive affectation of Selleck's character to insist that everyone call him Jesse after their initial sentence, greeting, whatever. In this movie, Gloria Reuben repeated ""Jesse"" so many times in that bar I wondered if she kept forgetting who she was talking to. Worse, several characters refer to him as Jesse Stone (hello, Gino Fish), although they already know who he is. Has anyone, ever, referred to someone they knew by their full name, repeatedly? Look, Selleck does such a good job writing this role as well as acting it, but enough already with the Jesse and the Jesse Stone.

And one final note: if you're going to steal a line from one of our greatest playwrights, Herb Gardner, don't steal it from a play in which you starred in the Broadway revival. Following a line about returning to reality:

""A Thousand Clowns"" -- Murray Burns: I'll only go as a tourist.
""Lost in Paradise"" -- Jesse: I'll only go as a visitor.

I know writers steal from each other (believe me, I know). But I feel this was egregious and pretty disappointing.",1453075200,4,1147,4.640394088669951
7516553,5,B017RR6YJE,"The long interval between Jesse Stone TV movies made some of us afraid this wonderfully watchable series might be over and done with.  However, Tom Selleck has shifted his production to the Hallmark Channel without losing a step...

""Lost in Paradise"" finds a bored Jesse Stone looking for more action by signing up with the Boston Police Department to work cold cases.  A murder ascribed to an already convicted serial killer piques his interest.  Jesse digs into the case, and soon finds that turning over old rocks can lead to new problems, including with his new boss at Boston PD, an attractive redheaded female lieutenant.  In his spare time, Jesse tries to turn around the life of a teenager on the brink of being lost.  Jesse makes promises to the mother, a recovering alcoholic, that he might not be able to keep...

This is a nicely done ""Jesse Stone"", much appreciated after the long interval between movies.  The production values are up to standard, and the plot allows Jesse to touch base with a lot of old friends, and to make a few new ones, including a replacement for Reggie, who has moved on to dog heaven.  The plot itself does a nice slow build to a fairly dramatic climax.  Recommended to fans of the Jesse Stone movies.",1450137600,104,1242,4.655963302752293
7516554,5,B017RR6YJE,"Tom Selleck has grown old very gracefully. He's no longer Magnum, although every once in a while you can catch some Magnum gestures in Frank Reagan of ""Blue Bloods.""

Tom owns Jesse Stone. It's the role he was born to play and he wears it like a comfortable, old coat. He is just amazing. And, as always, he lets his supporting cast shine. He's the sort of actor who knows that when your support looks good, so do you.

I sincerely hope there will be more Jesse Stone movies, especially since he has acquired another dog who could be a twin for Reggie. I would love to see how his relationship with ""Steve"" plays out, as opposed to the one he had with Reggie. I cried when he said ""I lost my conscious"" when referring to Reggie.
