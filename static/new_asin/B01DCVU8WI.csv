8755502,4,B01DCVU8WI,"Enjoyable if a bit quaint and more general knowledge but worth watching to see the brilliant crews and commanders who clearly loved their work. Great to see Admiral Sir John Woodward GBE KCB who so aptly commanded Task Group 317.8 in the Falklands. Fair winds and following seas, Admiral.",1515369600,,288,4.8979591836734695
8755503,5,B01DCVU8WI,"I previously watched the televised documentary on August 6 this year, just by chance an of course enjoyed the documentary tremendously.  I purchased the DVD in order to show it to my other friends and veterans.

I am sure they will also enjoy becoming more aware of the issues that were faced during the cold war beneath the waves!",1510617600,,331,4.593220338983051

8755506,4,B01DCVU8WI,"Every now and then I wax nostalgic of my younger days and the part I played ""on the front lines of the cold war"".  The BBC has done a wonderful job of telling some stories of that time and the Soviet, UK, and US sailors that made them.  This will be one I return to again and again.  I just wish it was longer.",1477180800,2,310,3.8125
8755507,3,B01DCVU8WI,There is much more information readily available on this subject that has been declassified. From the description I had thought this would have been much more in depth - this is just scratching the surface and to have spent $10.00 on it seems quite a shame. If you are already familiar with the subject don't bother. Should have been available on Prime.,1475971200,,353,4.709677419354839
