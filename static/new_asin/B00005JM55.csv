1484890,5,B00005JM55,"All right, I saw a sneak preview of the movie last week. It was awesome!  I was lucky enough to snag some tickets to see the movie. Being such a fan of the first movie, I was ecstatic!
I don't want to give away too much so there won't be any spoilers here. We now see Elle several years later, engaged to Emmitt (played again by Luke Wilson, you can tell this is a good sequel since they got every single actor back to play their character again, the flops are the ones where they have to end up replacing actors.) who is now teaching at Harvard (a slight glitch in the storyline, because at the end of the first I thought they said he was opening his own law firm?) and the couple are planning their wedding.
Elle has planned the guest list, inviting his friends and her friends and their family, and then it hits her: the one person who has always been there to support her has no guests: her lovely Chihuahua Bruiser! So she hires a detective to track down his relatives. It turns out his mom ""works"" for a makeup testing facility. When she tries to buy her back and can't, she ends up trying to fight the law and have animal testing banned.
She ends up going to Capitol Hill (it's her first day when we see her infamous Jackie outfit) to lobby for her bill to be passed. Along the way, she is met with a lot of animosity from people who are supposed to be helping her pass her bill since she has no experience, and she realizes bills aren't written and passed in a day.",1057017600,,1473,4.186619718309859
1484891,5,B00005JM55,"This Movie is the greatest movie of all!!!! Reese has done it again with her preppy, bubbly character, Elle.  Totally shows blonde ambition!!! GREAT MOVIE!!! AWESOME!!",1056326400,6,167,5.423076923076923
1484892,5,B00005JM55,"I had my reservations about seeing the first film of Legally Blonde but my worries were soon oblivious as it was clear that the movie was (as cheesy as it sounds) fun.
From a simple concept of blondes being the stupid bimbo's of the earth, we follow the stereotypical social blonde 'poster girl' Elle Woods through her melodramas of becoming a law student after being dumped by her boyfriend. Elle Woods gets the drive to join Harvard and start vying to graduate as a fully fledged Law student just to spite her ex-boyfriend.
The layed back atmosphere the movie creates can hopefully be duplicated in Legally Blonde 2. The ditzy, 'Clueless' style of comedy is one of the warmer aspects the film plays out so well. Some comedies rely on plot others rely on performance, I believe that Legally Blonde had a nice equilibrium between the two and is a reason why it has cult Teen following with other such great teen movies.
Reese Witherspoon, the main star, was a perfect choice for the protagonist of Elle Woods. Reese Witherspoon definately hits the role on the head as she has great comedic timing and is not afraid to make a fool of herself. Her endearing antics and irreplacable facial expressions really gives Elle Woods an aura  of her own.
But what can we expect of a Legally Blonde sequel?! Having a sequel is usually a big gamble or just an easy cash-in. All we can know so far is the general storyline.
Reese Witherspoon is back as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde. Now Elle is juggling a demanding career as a rising young lawyer as well as preparations for her wedding to the man of her dreams. But when she stands up for the other guy of her life - Bruiser, her chihuahua - Elle is fired from her job.
She's devastated but you can't keep an optimist down. Ms Woods goes to Washington into her own well-manicured hands. Trying to learn the political ropes and win over self-serving politicians. Elle faces a formidable challenge. But with her clever and sassy signature blend of determination and intelligence, she bucks the system the Elle Woods way, inspiring those around her to find a voice of her own.
We will only find out on July 2nd whether Legally Blonde 2 can live up to the original film and hopefully surpass it.",1055808000,19,2254,4.579207920792079

1485676,3,B00005JM55,"I watched ""Legally Blonde"" shortly after it came out. Although the plot wasn't deep and was fairly predictable, I enjoyed it. Reese Witherspoon did a great job of acting as Elle, the girl who, having been dumped by her college sweetheart because she isn't smart enough, sets out to prove him wrong by not only getting accepted by Harvard Law School but also by excelling while she is there.

""Legally Blonde 2"" was pointless. Okay. So there's this cute little dog whose mother is locked away in an animal research facility. Elle goes to Washington to seek to put an end to such research. And that's about the extent of the plot. Of course, there's a few laughs along the way, a few funny moments, but, other than as a plug for animal rights, there was little point to making this movie. (I came away from it wishing that I had used my $7.50--or whatever the price of movies was back then--as well as my time for something else.) In a nutshell, ""Legally Blonde 2"" joins a host of movies that have tried to play off the success of the original and have failed miserably.

The only reason I have given it three stars is because Reese Witherspoon is an outstanding actor, and is the one redeeming quality in this film.",1380931200,,1214,4.48868778280543

The only thing Legally Blond 2 got right is bringing back the original actors to play their characters.

In the first Legally Blond, Elle is intelligent, if not a bit naive. She may come across as a little ditzy but she isn't, and it's apparent in many scenes. In Legally Blond 2 she is completely stupid. Like OMG Animal Rights for our gay dogs and stuff.

This movie could have been amazing. The potential to make a movie with a ""girly"" but still ridiculously intelligent woman, was huge, but in the end this movie fell hard. I wouldn't recommend this movie under normal circumstances, but if you are having a dumb movie night and it's free, you might just try it to see what I mean.",1328832000,,823,4.401315789473684

I don't know maybe people saw the dizzy blonde that the not yet won over cynics in the movie projected upon her and not the inspirational eccentric Elle that not only had brains but a HUGE heart to boot.

I truly think Legally Blonde 2 was one of the most positive entertaining movies out there. I'm not one for movie sequels but I would definitely entertain the possibility of seeing a Legally Blonde 3, maybe something to do in the vein of the spiritual.

Oh by the way, if you see the movie on DVD, Legally Blonde 2 honestly has one of the best gag reals I have ever seen. It was cut and edited with just the right music.

It also features less known names but still familiar faces like Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach.

Sally Field brings her wonderful acting ability to the movie and you will not be disappointed in it. The movie is not just for animal lovers (as Bruiser the chihuahua along with other dogs are featured throughout)but to people who love happy endings, comedy, love stories, women accomplishment, and for standing up for what you believe in against opposition.

As one who believes you can't criticize something unless you have seen it or read it; I borrowed the film from somebody.

If I had seen this in the theater; I would have been really mad at wasting money.  Especially the prices these days.

The film seemed to pander rather then tell a story.  It tried to relive the past and failed miserably.  At the end of the first film; you felt that Elle had matured a little.  She regressed in this film.  The ""oh my gawd"" dingy blond was played to the hilt.  You just didn't get the savvy moments she would have in the other film.

There were many sight gags that were just bad.  I didn't even get a chance to laugh.  I have a hard time believing that barracuda congresswomen would go for ""funky"" hair.  An arch-conservative NRA President congressman announcing he has a gay dog and is happy about it? Congress having a compliment jar?  Gag!  I really had to fight the urge to stop the film.  Maybe I was hoping it would get better.

There were new characters but there was little or no time developing them.  Bob Newhart could have been really interesting but nothing really happened.  Sally Field could have been interesting as the friend who is really an enemy and yet they couldn't allow that to happen as she eventually turned around.

The final fight happens with a speech before Congress.  It could have been a great ""Capraesk"" moment ala Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  But it failed.

The agony finally ends with Elle getting married and driving off for the honeymoon.  Emmet asks here where she wanted to live and she eyeballs the Whitehouse.

Luckily this will never happen.

The DVD has the usual extras.  I tried watching the deleted scenes. Usually, there are some you can argue they should have stayed in the film.  This is not the case.  They were just bad bad bad!

The tension between the real world and Elle's naivete which constituted the parameters in the first film's dialectic (and which gave it meaning) is here wanting. Her opposition are straw dogs set up to bring Elle's ingenuity into relief. Her artless, winning ways are ridden on the ""means and ways committee"" of Elle's too easily won-over circle of admirers. They must have all seen her come out on top in the first movie since her accomplishments are cited by Regina King's impressive lawyer early on.

 The situations are entertaining, but silly (and in some instances tasteless). And that's okay too. Silliness can be entertaining, but not emotionally engaging, and that's where the film breaks ranks from the earlier effort.

 Witherspoon is still fun to watch in her take-no-prisoners Pollyanna ways that proably sounds a ubiquitous chord. Regina King more than ably fills the shoes of Selma Blair's similarly agonistic role, as an intolerant, envious lawyer who finally lets her inherent decency get the better of her.

 The movie? Too bad it all seems like a rehash of the first one, at best; at worst, a bit too silly and predictable.

Who ever wrote this script turned Elle into some kind of superhuman. Elle has the ability to change how Washington operates just by being Elle.

 Although the cast was great, the script and the directing was sub-par. The director added a pink glow above Elle's head whenever she was in a scene. This was pointed out by the director in the DVD extra segment. Did he get this idea from Touched by an Angel? Thank goodness they never made Legally Blonde 3.

But every single one of them fell short of the achieved goal. Legally Blonde 2 was meant to be funny. But the gay dogs joke not only wasn't funny, it was even some sort of agenda!

And, get this - it turns out that Elle's dog is gay. I mean, how stupid can you get? Did they run out of jokes that are actually humorous, and they had to resort to this?

Also, the movie seems to be trying to get the animal rights message of cosmetics testing on animals being wrong across to viewers. I can understand the writer or writers wanting to do this, as I have learned about what actually happens to the animals in these tests. Few people know that tests for cosmetics, shampoos, ect. that are done on animals are not simply putting make-up on them, or washing them with shampoo. What really happens is that the product is put in restrained animals' eyes and left there for several days, or is force-fed in large quanities to the animals, to see the products' effect on the animals.

However, the movie has a line about how animal testing of make-up is wrong because forcing a dog to wear make-up is wrong, and, after Elle's anti animal testing bill is passed, the lab animals are released, unharmed. So, the movie just perpetuates the myth that animals are not seriously harmed in cosmetics testing.

Unfortunately the private detective, hired to find Bruiser's mother, discovers she is in an animal testing laboratory and they won't release her. Elle decides to take up the fight against animal testing and launches herself on an unsuspecting Washington senate.
Like all too many sequels, Legally Blonde 2 does not live up to its predecessor. The story is just an extension of the original move, nobody takes Elle seriously as she's blonde, dressed in pink, looks like Barbie,etc... but she proves them all wrong etc. etc. The story line tries to push the moral issue of using animals in experiments. Unfortunately, the message is lost in all the froth that surrounds it.
This isn't the worst film you could watch, it's certainly ok for one of those nights when you don't want to have to concentrate too much and just want simple entertainment.

1485969,1,B00005JM55,"Given the great success, both artistic and and financial, of Legally Blonde perhaps it was inevitable there be a sequel. What wasn't inevitable was that it be this bad.

To start with, Elle Woods' IQ has dropped about 30 points between films. Maybe 40. Her characterization consists primarily of doing and saying things so godawfully stupid we cringe. In the first movie, though Elle was portrayed as sort of super-Valley Girl, and a bit obsessional on the topics of clothes and hair care products, still there was a first-rate brain under all that curly blonde hair. Where is the smart, self-possessed, articulate Elle from the end of the first movie? I ask, because she's nowhere to be seen in Legally Blonde 2. Reese Witherspoon is a fine actress who should have known enough to flee in terror from this script.

Another problem with Legally Blond 2: the plot is built around obvious absurdities. Elle decides she needs to find her dog Bruiser's mother so she can invite Mrs. Bruiser to her upcoming wedding. Jesus wept. Let's pause for a moment to recognize that in the first movie, even though Elle loved her pet as much as many pet owners do, she never descended into blithering idiocy about it. Elle hires a private detective to locate the mother of this homeless stray she found on the street years ago....and the detective does it! No explanation of how, it's just a fait accompli. All I could think was, ""You have GOT to be kidding me."" In the first movie, its great attraction was that it took place basically in the real world, with a logical cause-and-effect system in place. It's just that Elle was the destabilizing factor that pushed things over the edge into comedy. In Legally Blonde 2 there's no logical cause-and-effect; things happen just because the plot requires them.

Elle, using the detective's information, tracks Mrs. Bruiser to an animal testing facility. Thereafter we're treated to a dissertation on what a horrible, horrible thing this is. Okay, the morality of animal testing is something we could debate, pro and con. There's a place for that, but it's not in a movie like this. If you want to preach, get a soapbox. We're paying our eight dollars and fifty cents on a Reese Witherspoon Legally Blonde movie to be amused and entertained, not to watch the world's longest PETA commercial.",1127088000,6,2321,4.81203007518797

There were some funny moments (snapping cup), but those were few and far between. There were too many jokes about Bruiser and another dog being gay. If you are from PETA, you will give a standing ovation for Elle's efforts, but if not, you will probably want to turn it off long before it's over.",1123804800,2,512,4.288659793814433

1485973,3,B00005JM55,"Reese Witherspoon is quietly assembling a body of work that proves her talents as a comic actress.  While the magnificent ""Election"" may ultimately prove to be the best performance of her career, her work in ""Legally Blonde"" made that silly movie into a surprising hit.  ""Legally Blonde 2"" does not rise to the same level of the first movie, but to the extent it succeeds, it does so on the sheer radiance and comic timing of our favorite sorority sister-turned Harvard law grad.

""LB2"" starts with Ms. Elle Woods running around as the star associate of a major law firm . . . which is as much to do with her legal skills as it is with Elle's devotion to brownies, sincere compliments, and overall bubbliness.  But her conscience gets the better of her when she learns that one of the firm's major clients tests cosmetics on animals, including her pet dog's mommy.  Of course, her conscience gets her fired and she's like, you know, totally bummed.

But this being Elle Woods, she cannot fail to land on her feet, and soon she's off to D.C. to be an aide for Senator Sally Field so she can work on a bill to outlaw cosmetic testing, or something.  ""LB2"" is one of those movies where you don't need to bother with the characters' names -- the supporting roles are broad, cliched characters but are generally fun because the actors are caught up in the sheer silliness of it all.  Bob Newhart, Regina King, Stifler's Mom, and many other supporting characters get on screen, make you smile, and move on.

While perhaps not as inspired as the first movie, ""LB2"" has a few definite high points, such as when Elle Woods activates the super-secret sorority-crisis code, causing thousands of earnest sisters to descend on the Mall in D.C. in support of Ms. Woods (although undoubtedly upset that the Mall doesn't even have a Starbucks.)  Through it all, Elle keeps her chin up and her eyes wide open, and her combination of zeal, sincerity, insight, and naivete -- not to mention beauty -- will surely win you over.

A good rental, or a good pick-up from the $5.99 overstock shelves, ""Legally Blonde 2"" is an inoffensive, silly comedy that can give you a couple of laughs on a rainy day.  The DVD extras are so-so, which is appropriate for this movie.",1120521600,2,2243,4.608040201005025

This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.

Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast.

It's exactly the same storyline as the first one, and nothing has changed. Elle goes to work at Congresswoman Rudd's office. She finds out that she dosen't fit in with everyone else initially. Remove Harvard Law school; insert the latter. Grace Rossiter (Regina King) is nothing more than the sequel's version of Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). Reese's hair changes with every scene, and as she was still growing out her short hairstyle from Sweet Home Alabama, all Elle's hair and hairstyles throughout the movie are top-grade wigs.

This features nearly all of the original characters from the first, along with some brand new ones - Sally Field for instance. I would have loved to see Selma Blair return.

That being said, I didn't enjoy it, and neither did my husband.

Besides the plot, I have another huge complaint with this movie! Elle Woods's dog, Bruiser, turns out to be a gay dog, which went well with the completely irrational, retartedness of the movie. The person who came up with that surprise needs to get out of the movie-making business. And it didn't even stop there. At the end of the movie, the two dogs are ""married.""

Reese continues to play the character superbly.  Sally Field played an excellent villain and Luke Wilson's role, although small, made this a pretty seamless movie.

Which kind of sums up the movie!  and really, how can you resist a Barbie doll's sweetness, cheeriness, friendliness and cuteness?  well, you can't.  so why try?

Hint:  THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE.  The movie makes that really clear immediately... if anything it's even farther from life as we live it than Legally Blonde (the original) was.  So you have to accept that to enjoy the film.  This isn't the story of a nice girl who's discriminated against because she's blonde and pretty but turns out to be shrewd-- this is far closer to Gidget Goes to Washington.  Elle is saved by, for example, having a tough congresswoman turn out to be a sorority sister-- and another turn out to have a dog who has romantic feelings for her little dog Bruiser-- which means both dogs are (gulp) gay.

The story itself is thin but good-hearted, about Elle's fight to pass ""Bruiser's Bill"" (named for her Chihuaha) to end animal testing.  Elle was inspired to do this when she discovered Bruiser's mom-- she'd hired a Private Detective to find her, because she wanted to invite her to the wedding-- was imprisoned by a company doing animal testing.  In other words, even the premise is over the top goofy-- animal testing is a good/GREAT cause, but Elle and her wedding invitations are just silly.  And that's part of the movie's charm.

It does have some aspirations to Capra and ""freeing the voice of the people"" (there's even a clip from the immortal Jimmy Stewart in Washington film...) and Witherspoon gets some crowd-pleasing inspirational speeches, but they don't weigh the movie down anymore than a medium hair conditioner...

The million-dog march is a hoot (as is the ringing of the pink-phone alert that leads to the mobilization of the Delta Nus).  and there is a little bit of Washington insider stuff to keep things lively.  Nobody is too nasty-- some misguided politicos, but no villains.

This is a real feelgood movie, equivalent of a lightweight beach novel.

The DVD extras are pretty good too, including a featurette on the making of the film that was more interesting than most-- instead of being a love-in from the director to the actors or vice versa, it showed how many of the scenes were done with visual effects since shooting in some D.C. sites was either impossible or costly.  Very interesting.  The gag reel was cute and you had the feeling that everyone involved really had a good time making this-- including the fabulous Bob Newheart and Sally Field.",1093392000,2,2585,4.787810383747178

""Legally Blonde 2"" captures the charm and humor from the first movie by plopping Elle Woods down in the heart of Washington DC.  The whole concept of the plot is that Elle tries to get her law firm to support ""Bruiser's Bill"" (yes, it's named for her dog) to put an end to product testing on animals.  Elle ends up getting sacked, and she decides to go to Washington to pitch the bill herself.  Yes, the movie is pretty predictable, but it's also pretty darn funny.  Homosexual dogs, ""Snaps for Congress,"" and an invasion of the Delta Nus are just a sampling of the funny scenes this film has to offer.  Although many of the characters from the first ""Legally Blonde"" film make an appearance in the sequel, I was disappointed that most of them weren't in it for more than a few minutes.

1486106,2,B00005JM55,"Being a Reese Witherspoon fan, I was looking forward to this sequel to the sleeper hit, ""Legally Blonde"".  Unfortunately, I have to admit that this film was a total disappointment.  ""Red White and Blonde"" fell into the trap that a lot of sequels fall prey to----a movie rushed into production with nothing new to add to the original and losing the charm that made the first film so appealing.  Most of the co-stars are back from the first film, including Luke Wilson as Elle's husband, and Jennifer Coolidge (who I always enjoy seeing) as Elle's cosmotologist buddy.  Added to the cast are Sally Fields, who is totally wasted, and Bob Newhart, who is just not right for the role he was given.  The story revolves around Elle trying to find her dog Brusier's mother, and becomes a quest for animal rights that predictably sets up obstacles for the tenancious and charming Elle Woods.  The problem is that the writers didn't seem to time to make the characters appealing or interesting and the story just doesn't give the viewer a real reason to care.  I seriously doubt there will be a third film for Elle Woods and its probably just as well.  I think the first film was enough and left the viewer satisfied---there just was not enough there to suggest a real sequel.  In any case, just buy the original and leave this film for the bargain bin.  And if you are looking for a good Reese film, there are plenty out there----""The Importance of Being Earnest"", ""Sweet Home Alabama"", and ""Freeway"", all worth viewing.

On the DVD extras (I did not manage to watch them all) they said they had tried to make her appear more mature but I think they need a dictionary as she appeared the furthest thing from a Harvard graduate that I have ever seen.

 The entire tone is set with the opening credits. A sweeping orchestration underscores the political theme that the movie will take, and there's such a lack of fun in it that it hits you in your gut, and you just know that this is not going to be the same fun ride we had in the first film. The funny characters are still there, but there's a sense throughout the movie that all of the actors know that the film is not as good as the first, so there's a sense of ""forced fun"" to this sequel, like everyone is trying too hard. And poor Elle is pretty much a rehashed version of herself. Whereas in the first film, she evolved and still remained true to herself, she seems to be at Square 1 in this sequel. And I can understand the path the filmmakers were trying to take - we all have to start over at various points in our lives, but for some reason, this storyline was unable to make that idea completely work.

1486110,5,B00005JM55,"A bit of fluff, this movie nonetheless shows a great intelligence in the ongoing moral and spiritual evolution of Elle Woods.
Most guys like me naturally consider upper class blondes (of whom Reese Witherspoon is an example: she is a lineal descendant of the great Puritan divine John Witherspoon and she went to Princeton) to be belle dames sans merci and many specimens are indeed.
But there is also that stunning blonde who is nice with it and kind to the lower orders.
I have long had a soft spot for Lady Diana and Evita Peron, two blondes (one courtesy of Clairol) whose radiance was complemented by spiritual growth, albeit from a low level.
The screenwriters had enough brains to realize that to be attractive, Elle has to have both innocence, and strength. Thus when put down at the office she preserveres.
Of course, informed by the unhealed epistemological wounds of American society, the film collapses towards the end of its own weight. But, it covers us all in pink chiffon and in these dark days it is a genuine diversion, which is all the screenwriters wanted to produce.
Of course, to be safe, the movie takes the side of small animals, in that Blakean gesture which asks l'homme arme, just how far his rapacity goes today. But for me, an interest in marginal fluff and pocket lint is at this stage a revolutionary gesture.
Especially attractive is an aging Bob Newhart's star turn as the doorman of an ill-disguised Watergate Hotel. His martini-dry humor dates from the Silent Generation of the 1950s but it is coupled with a sobriety and moral seriousness one would expect from a doorman.
Kant tells us that all we can know to be good is purity of heart and perhaps the screenwriters realized this instinctively.
On the downside it is unfortunate that the production chose an excellent African-American actress (who played Ron Tigwell's feisty wife in Jerry Maguire) as a foil to Elle, for it color-codes the situation. But it would take a William Blake to work out how to represent white on black in contemporary America, where the younger generation is so anxious to avoid simplifying assumptions that it winds up in Jim Crow territory.",1086393600,,2157,4.801075268817204
1486171,3,B00005JM55,"The irrepressible and undefeatable Elle Woods (the glorious Reese Witherspoon) is back in all her hot-pinkness in this quickly put-together 2003 sequel to the original LEGALLY BLONDE (2001). That movie was a fun fantasy romp with Elle in the halls of Harvard Law School, showing up her snooty ex-boyfriend who had dumped her for being ""too blonde."" Kinetically directed by first-time feature director from Down Under, Robert Luketic (now enjoying his second big hit in a row with this year's WIN A DATE WITH TAD HAMILTON!), LEGALLY BLONDE created a new kind of comic hero improbably triumphing through adversity.
LEGALLY BLOND 2: RED, WHITE & BLONDE carries this character and the story to the next level, as Elle pursues the whereabouts of the mother of her Chihuaha, Bruiser. Finding that Bruiser's Mom is a test subject for cosmetics, an outraged Elle decides to get her law firm involved. They present no interest to the subject, and when pressed on the subject, ignobly fire her. As in the first film where she loses her boyfriend early on, she breaks down into tears; after all, she's scheduled to be married to her Law School beau Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) before long, and she can't be out of a job when that happens! Ah, but as in the first film, she doesn't stay downtrodden for long: she'll take her case to Washington, where she already has a friend in Rep. Victoria Rudd (Sally Field). She joins her staff (leading to a seemingly-interminable number of scenes in which Elle gets mistaken for an intern), and proceeds to turn her office upside-down. Of course, it's required that she have an enemy right away, and she finds one quickly in Grace Rossiter (Regina King) who is incredibly put-off by Elle's sunny demeanor and ""snap-box"" ideas. Elle finds that battling against animal testing is not as simple as it should be, as she tries to make ""Bruiser's Law"" a reality in the face of Congressional deal-making and back-stabbing. Her one believer is her fiance Emmett, who just *knows* that Elle Can Do Anything. Inspired by his supportiveness, Elle slowly begins to make friends in her office and on Capitol Hill, improbably bonding with frigid Congresswoman Libby Hauser (veteran character actress Dana Ivey) over their shared Delta Nu background. Her biggest ally turns out to be her own apartment building doorman, Sid Post (the always-welcome Bob Newhart). However, even with her new-found political friendships, including a hilarious scene in which she bonds with conservative Texas Congressman Stanford Marks (Bruce McGill) over the newly-found gayness of their dogs (you read that right), Elle realizes that not all her political friends are what they seem to be.
Let's face it: The LEGALLY BLONDE series is never going to win any Academy Awards for anything. But, somehow they provide an effective escape and are fun movies to watch. I like the occasional subtle references in LEGALLY BLONDE 2, the best one being the one in which Elle is first shown walking up the U.S. Capitol steps from overhead, a bright pink dot in a sea of black & white; this is very reminiscient of the Ascot scene in MY FAIR LADY (1964), in which Audrey Hepburn comes out in her brightly-colored outfit in the midst of all the gray-colored Ascot suits. Reese Witherspoon may be a fair lady herself, however, LEGALLY BLONDE 2; RED, WHITE & BLONDE becomes too ludicrous for its own good. You know Elle is going to eventually triumph sooner or later, and while some scenes are highly watchable, as a whole this film doesn't retain the same level of charm as the first. It didn't help that a different director, Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, took the helm of this project; Robert Luketic seemed to have a better grasp of comedic editing in the first film. But for mindless entertainment, one could definitely do worse.

However, law school is not quite what she had in mind, it's not like her life back in California where she was president of her sorority and a Hawaiian Tropic Girl.  Elle fights the battle of her life for herself and blonds everywhere and most of all, for her guy.  This movie is funny with a bit of a corny blend, but is definitely worth watching although not receiving any awards or nominations.

1486175,3,B00005JM55,"Elle Woods, who turned Harvard Law School on its scholastic ear in the original ""Legally Blonde,"" now brings her unique brand of bubbly optimism to the cynical world of Washington politics in ""Legally Blonde II,"" the hit-or-miss sequel that skates by on the enormous and not-to-be-underestimated charm of Reese Witherspoon in the lead role.  In this film, Elle has her consciousness raised when she discovers the ""evil"" of animal testing for beauty products.  Filled with an idealistic zeal and determination, the bubbleheaded, fashion-obsessed lawyer heads off to the hallowed halls of the nation's capital to convince the powers-that-be to pass a law against this inhumane practice.
In the best screwball comedy tradition, Elle, though she appears on the surface to be hopelessly ditzy and out of touch with the real world, actually turns out to be shrewder and more effective at getting things done than anyone else around her.  The screenplay for ""Legally Blonde II"" provides little more than an endless variation on the fish-out-of-water theme that was exploited to a fare-thee-well in the previous installment.  Given the rather uneven nature of the writing, the film is blessed by having Witherspoon as both its star and its saving grace.  Without her, ""Legally Blonde II"" would be much less palatable and watchable than it is.  Witherspoon has her part down perfectly, conveying a sort of nave irrepressibility that is truly winning and infectious.  With her air of determined idealism and blithe indifference to the obstacles that so often knock the rest of us down, Elle, in the person of Witherspoon, becomes a fantasy-world champion for the little guy in the audience, often turning what might have been unutterable silliness into inspired zaniness.  That is the actress's impressive achievement here.
With its gallery of caricatures rather than characters and its heavy emphasis on bright colors and exaggerated fashions, ""Legally Blonde II"" looks and plays at times like a live action cartoon.
How much you'll enjoy the film will depend on both your tolerance for insipidity and your willingness to suspend your disbelief (it may also help if you lean left politically).  But only the most stonehearted curmudgeon could resist the charms of this particular blonde named Reese.",1077926400,,2290,5.252054794520548
1486176,2,B00005JM55,"There is a curse in the movie industry. It's name - the sequel. For some reason, trying to follow up a hit movie with a sequel is very difficult for most studios because most sequels suck eggs. I forgot about this curse when I rented Legally Blonde 2 - Red, With & Blonde recently. It's not that the first movie, Legally Blonde, was a masterpiece or anything, but it was good for what it was. It was a happy, shiny movie where you dismissed a little reality and just went with the story. Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) may be a silly character, but you go with it just to watch the character grow and mature. In addition, there were a nice assortment of memorable characters peppered throughout the story that really ""kicked it up a notch"".
Since Legally Blonde was a big hit, you'd think that the producers wouldn't mess with the formula that made it such a success. Haven't we learned anything from New Coke? ;) Unfortunately all the elements that made the first movie such a fun guilty pleasure are absent from the sequel and all you're left with is a bitter taste in your mouth making you feel wrong for liking the first movie.
The biggest problem with the movie is the script. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and this script was dead on arrival. Instead of using the original writers, Karen McCullah Lutz the studio chose Ahlert,  Drake and Kondell. Again, why miss with a winning combination? Anyway, the opening sequence is a scrapbook that the friends Margot (Jessica Cauffiel) and Serena (Alanna Ubach) are looking through. The device is meant to catch the viewer up on what's been happening to Elle. This works nicely for those that didn't see the first movie and for those of us that have, it works to set us back in place in the Elle timeline. At the end of the first movie, they said that Elle married Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson). At the start of the second film, they explain that the wedding hasn't happened yet and is scheduled to happen soon. This choppy style of storytelling works well when used in this manner, unfortunately the entire movie is told in this manner.
Instead of creating story arcs for the characters that can grow and lead us through the story, we're presented with chunky segments. It's almost as if you're watching ""bits"" from SNL or something. I can just see the writers pitching these ideas back and forth, ""Hey, how about Elle goes to Washington? Yeah! And there's this mean lady that runs the office. Yeah! And the door man is really cool and helps her. Yeah! And her fiancee comes to visit. Yeah! And <i>then</i> she's on CSPAN. Yeah!"" It was just scene after scene that didn't develop anything. The comedy was forced and it felt as if everyone was just walking through their scenes.
Think I'm just being mean? Well, let's look at the plot and then you can tell me. ""Elle is getting married and she decides that she wants her dog, Bruiser, to have his parents at the wedding. She learns that Bruiser's mother is being used for animal testing so she goes to Washington to pass a bill to outlaw animal testing."" That's it. I'm not kidding. That's really the plot. I know, who would have green lighted this kind of project?
As I saw the story unfold like someone dropping a sack of potatoes, I held out for the hope that the supporting characters would help redeem this movie. No such luck. Emmett the fiancee was reduced to a caricature of his former self. In the first movie Emmett helped ground the movie in reality. He wasn't a doe eyed goof, he was the smart, sensible legal hero that sees Elle as a ""diamond in the rough"" and what potential she holds. In this movie, he's nothing but a sycophant who does nothing more than say ""Yes dear."" and mug for the camera. To add insult to injury, Paulette Bonafont (Jennifer Coolidge) the lovable manicurist who is befriended by Elle in the first film, is reduced to nothing but the eccentric goofball sidekick who makes one stupid comment after another. Even Bob Newheart couldn't keep this ship afloat. All of the actors are credible in their field and are capable of doing so much more than this. The crime in all of this is that the script shackles them down to the point where they have no room to do what they do best - act.
I loved the first Legally Blonde movie. It was silly and somewhat of a farce, but the story and the characters made you just ""go with it"" and enjoy yourself. It wasn't high film, it was just a good time. Legally Blonde 2 is such a disaster it makes you sorry you enjoyed the first one altogether. By the end of the film, all the affection you had for the characters is gone. You just don't care about Elle anymore and you don't care where she goes from there. She gives a knowing wink to the camera at the end of the film to imply that there could be a 3rd film and I my only hope is that the studio doesn't get paroled to make it.",1077840000,7,4866,4.430803571428571

This movie just never takes off and never gets you into the whole premise: animal rights.
This movie falls into the trap of so many that have tried to capitalize on the success of a first: No real plot, just get the same people doing the same thing and it should work.  The movie drags on and by the end, you really just want to return the stupid movie to your local rental store.
The ""bonus"" material is a joke:  you get the music video (who cares) and outtakes (aren't those standard on every DVD now)?

He finds her in a cosmetics research faciliity that her firm represents. When Elle demands the firm force the cosmetics company to stop testing on thedogs, she is fired. Soon sge is inspired to change the law itself and heads off to Washington as a Congressional aide.
Here's where things fall flat. I suppose its largely my own fault for having been involved in politics on the down and dirty level to the point I don't find satire of it amusing. LB II just didn't tweak politics quite as effectively as the first film ripped into the first year law student experience. Reese's Ms. Smith Goes to Washington"" was too idealistic an unbelievable. There more some really good laugh out loud moments, but nothing like the first. Reese was, of course, beautiful as always. No bikini shots here, though. What's up with that?
I liked Bob Newhart's role as a doorman and Washington insider who befriends Elle. He was much more subdued than I would have expeced. It would have been nice if they'd let Bob be Bob. It would have added a how new layerof effective jokes. They did let Sally Fields be Sally Fields, and she played Elle's manipulative, ""bought and paid for"" Congresswoman boss with gusto. I'm glad to see her still getting decent parts in a town the discards actresses after they hit forty, much less fifty.
If you can accept the instant, idealistic, and unrealistic change Elle has on DC then you'll have a really good time. Reese even almost convinced this old cynical heart.

1486281,1,B00005JM55,"Ok, I know what happened. Some prankster surreptitiously snuck in to the producers office and stole the original script and left a joke script that could only appeal to teenagers and Chihuahua's in it's place. The Prankster is now deceased. He died of laughter when they went ahead and made the movie anyway.
Once again our perky, plucky, privileged Beverly Hills valley girl / Harvard Law graduate, Elle Woods, is cavorting around in her pricey extravagant fashions and has found an extremely BANAL cause. It seems that Elle hired the most expensive private detective available, to track down her Chihuahua dog, Bruiser's, mother. Why? So the she(Elle) could invite her(Bruiser's mother) to her(Elle's) wedding. From the detective's information she(Elle) finds out that mother is a lab test animal for a cosmetic company and she is crushed (Elle). She can't possibly have the wedding without the attendance of her dog Bruiser's, mother. Do you get the enormity of the situation?
Great balls of fire
Having been unable to effect any action on the home front and even getting fired from her Law Office, our determined crusader lady heads to Washington to work on the staff of two faced, Congresswoman Victoria Rudd(Sally Fields), to submit legislation for the elimination of test animals within cosmetic companies and of course after navigating numerous obstacles and...well you get the picture.
I haven't seen a sillier movie since, well I don't remember but it's been a long time, maybe the Three Stooges. Silly is ok, in fact, it can even be good, if the movie is also funny. Madhouse, Ruthless People, and Road Trip come to mind as silly / stupid but extremely funny movies. Legally Blonde 2 wasn't very funny, it was a teensy bit cute and and has a decent sound track and that's why I gave it one star (1/2 rounded up).
The reason it was cute was because of Whitherspoon. She has an angelic appearance and plays this character to a tee, like she was born for it. She's either an excellent actress giving life to a dull movie or she's not acting. In any case she is the movie and I hope she won't be typecast for this part and get some serious parts in the future.
Another bright spot in a movie that was somewhat devoid of them, was the resurrection of Bob Newhart as Sid, Elle's Washington doorman. He was kind of her counselor and cheerleader.

With most of the jokes spent, the characters pretty much exhausted, and the freshness gone, ""Red, White, and Blonde"" fails to please, or even entertain.
Witherspoon, returning as Elle Woods, is, as always, a true movie star.  She has a glowing presence onscreen and it is impossible to not be charmed by her.  With that said, there is not much else to be enjoyed in this film.  The plot is ludicrous, boring, and, at times, downright pathetic (Elle learns that Bruiser the dog is gay after he gets frisky with another male).  And I'm not making this up, folks.  The humor is all dried up, the cuteness is gone, and snores soon set in.
The cast is the only redeeming factor of ""Red, White, and Blonde"".  As I said before, Witherspoon is fantastic.

My husband brought this film home one night after listening to me whine about wanting something kitschy and cute to watch after we put the little one to bed.  This was not it.
In the first movie, there's a moment or two when you think the movie could go either way - totally camp or totally bad.  It made the choice to go campy and it was worth it.  The sequel didn't make the same choice.
Clearly, the director thought that bringing back the same characters would inspire the same magic.  Nope.  Instead, it made an implausible script even more implausible.  Worse, when you thought the script couldn't get worse, it did - over and over again.

1486392,3,B00005JM55,"I have always enjoyed a good movie about American politics, ever since I first say ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.""  This was in former days, when there were only three television networks and PBS, videotape machines were not commercially available, and across the street from most college campuses there were ""art theaters"" that screened a different old movie every night.  The genre has certainly fallen on hard times, as evidenced by ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde,"" which is uses the basic idea of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and gives it a complete makeover.
The appeal of the original ""Legally Blonde"" was that Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) might be the paragon of blonde ditziness, but she could handle the complexities of the law as well as the intricacies of the world of beauty and cosmetics once she put here mind to it, which would happen in the name of a good cause.  The idea of this 2003 sequel to the 2001 original is to do the same thing, except this time send Elle to Washington, D.C., where she takes on the U.S. House of Representatives.  What inspires this career change?  Well, Elle is getting ready to marry Emmett (Luke Wilson), but discovers that she has not invited the parents of Buster, her adorable Chihuahua, so she hired a private detective to track them down and learns that Buster's mother is being held captive in an animal testing lab for (gasp) cosmetics, so Elle becomes an animals rights advocate because she cannot get married until she reunites mother and son.
Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with any of this, but when we get to Washington, D.C. we discover Congress consists of buffoons and simpletons.  Consequently, the fatal flaw of ""Legally Blonde"" is that whereas the first time around Elle rose to the occasion, showing how much damage absolute knowledge of beauty secrets can do in a court of law, this time the bar is lowered substantially so that our heroine can hop over it without much trouble.  Meanwhile, all the other reindeer, um, I mean Congressional aides, do not want to let Elle play in any of their Congressional games, and even ridicule her Snapcup.  In the end Elle overcomes everyone and everything, to no one's surprise.
The pivotal moment is when Elle gets to address Congress and give a speech.  Never mind that the situation is contrived, so forget about quoting Congressional rules on what is and what is not allowed with regards to outsides being allowed to speak to Congress.  All you have to do is compare Elle's speech to the one Jimmy Stewart gives at the end of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" to see how shallow this film ends up being.  Witherspoon's performance aside, there is absolutely nothing in the actual speech that should inspire anybody in Congress to do anything.  If you put on one of the foreign language tracks for the scene (in a language you do not understand), then the scene would work just as well.  In other words, we get to the big moment in the movie, and there is nothing there besides Reese Witherspoon's face and smile.
For fans of Elle, none of this is going to matter, and when she prattles on a warp speed about the beauty, fashions, cosmetics, and such you have to admit she is totally in her element.  But ""Red, White & Blonde"" was going to succeed on the strength of its political elements, and in that regard I have to admit I liked Eddie Murphy's ""The Distinguished Gentleman"" a lot better.",1070755200,2,3419,4.695652173913044

It lacks the snappy dialogue and clever madcap situations that elevated the prequel into the ranks of successful screwball comedies. This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.
Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast.

In the first film Elle is supposed to graduate in 2004 and does, yet when they do the cheerleading routine with the interns, the interns are in the class of 2003, a year before. However in Legally Blonde 2 Elle had graduated around two years before as when she graduated Paulette was pregnant whereas now her child is at least two years old.

1486525,2,B00005JM55,"From the beginning we know it's not going to work.  You see, this sequel is about Reese Witherspoon's career-making character Elle Woods, which was originally based on the prejudice against blonde women.  This time, it is not.
Now Elle is going to marry Luke Wilson's character Emmett.  She must invite everyone she loves, including the biological mother of her Chihuahua named Bruiser.  Elle is shocked to know that she is kept in a lab of a cosmetic company, and they are going to give some (apparently) terrible test on her.
So what is Elle going to do?  Clad in pink, she goes to Washington, to make a law against experiment on animals.  PLEASE.  I say, please.  Social issues like animal rights could be worthy cause, but this is not the right place to deal with them.  Should we be talking about Elle and her life?
OK, I ignore that point, but still there are many problems.  As Elle is not a Congressperson, let alone president of the United States, she needs some tricks to reach her end.  And what does she do?  Sorry to disappoint you, but it is done with so many incredible coincidences (my count rose up to at least four).  She walks the dog, the dog falls in love with another dog, whose owner turns out you know who.
I don't say that politics should be treated more seriously.  I know it is a comedy, but the process of legislation looks very simple and easy.  Not that the real US Congress is so.  But when you see the cheerleaders' dance is so influential in Washington, I start to worry about the kids who watch this film.  That joyful ""Bend and Snap"" trick worked because it is done in beauty salon.
And we have already known the outcome of the love between Elle and Emmett, and that reduces considerably the value of the story.  I am surprised to see the director's name Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, whose ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is so charming with a fresh look on lesbianism.  Now in ""Legally Blonde 2"" we have clithed jokes on politics and even gays (not again).  The original's interesting premise about the woman with brain and blonde hair is sadly missing.
This sequel is nothing but a recycled idea.  I know this is not so bad ... as a sequel, and some people (young girls in particluar) find it empowering experience.  But of course, you can see more effective films like ""Spirited Away"" or ""Whale Rider.""  In short, stick to the first one, which is much fresh and enpowering.",1070064000,3,2399,4.553738317757009

It offers new features, keeping the trilogy interesting.  The plot was written wonderfully, keeping the humor and the important life messages together.  Its humor keeps the audience awaiting the next event and the outcome of every event.  Elle Wood's fight to prevent animal cruelty in Washington D.C. offers many interesting twists and turns.  They only intense more as the movie continues.  Reese Witherspoon's role as Ms. Woods lives up to the original.  All other actors offer their own humor and unforgettable quotes: Alana Ubach, Jennifer Coolidge, Luke Wilson, and legendary actors Bob Newhart and Sally Field.  The costume designs are amazing.  They offer a further unforgettable experience, especially the ones revolving around Ms. Woods.  Such movie quality makes ""Legally Blonde 2"" worth watching more than once.

Reese Witherspoon is an extremely talented actress and played her role well, but not even Reese's infectious Elle could hold up the plot. Her performance is the reasoning behing my two-star rating--without her it would have been a one! The script lacked the humour so evident in the first LB installment and quite frankly I don't remember laughing once.

1486529,3,B00005JM55,"Being the complete opposite of the beauty-obsessed, cheery 'ditzy' blonde that Elle Woods is myself, I somehow managed to find the original ""Legally Blonde"" to be a really good, cute, funny movie. After all, at least Elle Woods is an animal-loving vegetarian animal rights activist. So am I. So naturally, I bought this movie.

The idea behind it is great: Elle Woods wants to save her dog's mother from an animal testing facility and end cruel animal research in the cosmetic industry for good using her new status in the legal profession. So it carries a great message. Sadly, the movie isn't much of a comedy at all. It isn't even all that entertaining. I probably wouldn't want to see it more than once, especially because Elle's constant ""preppy blonde"" antics are really starting to get annoying. Sure, the movies are cute, but let's face it: they're entirely unrealistic. No such person as Elle Woods could ever make it as a lawyer, let alone make it very far in the real world.

Sally Field and Bob Newhart aren't in this as much as you may be led to believe, either. It focuses on Bruiser, the dog. Somehow, a serious subject like animal rights gets Elle's comments on shoes, clothes, make-up, etc., thrown in every few minutes to really grate on your nerves and wonder how someone so superficial could also be so good, caring, and deep. There you go, deep: Not the best word to use for this film. More like ""fluffy."" It's definite fluff. Like her quote: ""In this case, the price of beauty is too high....I can't believe I said that!"" Ugh.

Still, if this is the only way to get across to people the problems with animal testing, it'll do. One woman Elle runs into says, ""I don't think about it, that does the trick!"" when asked to consider the horrible ways some animals get treated and abused. This shows the ignorance that so many people have that needs to change. A serious lesson in a movie that involves a Chihuahua falling in love with a Rottweiler. For corns' sake.

So while Elle's political views are right-on, the movie itself isn't exactly the greatest. Still, it's worth a see.",1068940800,4,2099,4.634408602150538
1486530,4,B00005JM55,"If you caught the first flick, you'll find little different in its sequel, but ""Legall Blonde 2"" is still a bag of preposterous fun.
Planning for her wedding to law professor Emmet Richmond (Luke Wilson), Elle Woods becomes determined to (Witherspoon) track down the biological parent of her Chihuahua, Bruiser.  Elated to find the dog belongs to Versace, Elle is shocked to find that the animal (and countless others) is subjected to testing by cosmetics makers.  Losing her job at a tony law firm when she tries to make an issue of animal testing, Elle heads for Washington where she hopes to change the law.  Linking up with an apparently successful and sympathetic congresswoman played by Sally Field, and learning the ways of Washington D.C.-style politics, LB2 essentially follows the pattern of the first movie - replacing law with cut-throat politics (initially hostile characters prove to be friends while friendly characters turn out to have their own agenda; Elle wins out over all using her mix of wackiness and wisdom).  The flick makes good use of some side characters, like Bruce McGill as a right-wing conservative who, luckily for Elle, is a proud dog owner (McGill may best be remembered as the mysterious ""D-Day"" from ""Animal House""; it's fun watching this flick thinking that his character may very well be the same as D-Day, only 40 years later); also Bob Newhart as a D.C. doorman who knows a thing or two about DC power politics (where was his character during Watergate?); but really belongs to a horde of extras mobilized by Elle to lead the fight on Capitol Hill.

The movie was already overboard when Elle went looking for Bruiser's 'real mom,' but it went WAY too far when Bruiser 'came out'!
This should teach Hollywood a lesson...you can't build an entire story around an orphaned, gay dog!  Give us credit for a little sense, PLEASE!  This movie is an insult!

This film has taken my respect for her abilities down many notches. I notice Witherspoon is an executive producer of this film.  Too bad. She needs to focus on acting and leave production to an individual with production talent.
The idea of a gay dog is just puerile and absurd beyond belief -- didn't ""South Park"" use that idea years ago (Stan's gay dog)?
I could have done with a lot less Bruiser in this film -- the dog is cute, but I didn't know I was going to be viewing an animal film.
The roles of the returning actors and actresses are pathetically underdeveloped. What about the Elle's fiance? He is barely in the film - an afterthought. The beautician who was so wonderful in the first ""Legally Blonde"" has no real purpose in this film.
Likewise, I would have liked to have seen more of Sally Field and Bob Newhart and a LOT LESS of that darned dog.
Reese Witherspoon tries too hard to be ""perky"" and the entire film flops.
The only redeeming value to this film is Witherspoon's wardrobe. However, dressing a gay dog in pink and decorating office space in pink is just too much.

1486597,3,B00005JM55,"She dazzled audiences in her comic take over of the Harvard Law School scene, but Reese Witherspoon's fabulous character, Elle Woods, won't stop there.  In the sequel to the surprisingly funny movie, Legally Blond, Elle has been fired from her law firm for not supporting her client's dabblings in cosmetic animal testing and is determined to save her dog's mother from life within a test lab. Legally Blond 2 exceeded my expectations in some respects, being that I actually laughed out loud at several scenes.  But unfortunately, as a whole, the movie has lost some of the essential plot and character components that made its precursor so memorable.
One must remember that, in general, sequels have a problem - their makers know what made the original film succeed.  In this case, the first Legally Blond film featured the amazing character of Elle Woods, who was a prodigy of her own.  Elle brought with her to Harvard Law School her sorority personality, fashion sense and her juvenille priorities of winning back her power and fame hungry ex-boyfriend.  Of course, she is seen as a disgrace by her classmates and professors and continues to make a fool of herself in public.  But as the movie continues, we still like Elle, who breaks a lot of stereotypes - she actually is very intelligent, witty and determined, but mostly she is benevolent and friendly to everyone.  The humor works through carefully calculated scenes in which Elle learns through trial and error how to interact and adjust to her new environment - and though her personality still allows hysterical dialogues and actions, we are relieved to see her succeed.
This is where Legally Blonde 2 fails - the movie plays up too much of Elle's eccentrism.  Now, though she's excelled at Law School and is breaking her way into the political machine of Washington, she has no inhibitions, references her sorority rituals twice as much as before and throws herself into embarrassing situations - and then doesn't back down!  Jokes and gags are lengthened to the point where scenes are no longer short and funny, but we start to feel embarrassed for our hot pink protagonist!  What's worse, is our supporting cast has been dumbed down a little.  Returning characters (i.e. Elle's sorority sisters and old hair dresser) are now even more air-headed and only one-dimensional.  The archnemisis-turned-friend, Vivian, has been replaced by Grace, a boring staff member to a corrupt politician (Sally Field).
Though the plot has lost much of its charm, the movie is not a total loss.  Almost every scene is packed with one-liners and visual spoofs of politics that will keep people laughing, though sometimes uncomfortably.  Allies that had been Harvard Professors are now replaced by goofy politicians and senators, who bond over their common love of their pets, even the Republican Senator who finds his man-eating Rottweiler is actually a ....  :)  Sally Field's character even gets to slip a wonder line, ""Don't worry, I'll get her - and her little dog, too!""
Overall, Legally Blond 2 is a fun campy film, at least worth renting.  The lack of vulgar humor and obscenities make this movie a prime canidate for pre-teen sleep overs or a movie to enjoy with Grandma.  Still, one must appreciate the fashonable serenades given by Elle to Congress and spoofs that involve the combining of Sorority Sisters and the Secret Service under the ""Mission Impossible"" theme.  But hey, everyone needs something funny to watch on a Monday night!",1068595200,,3492,4.969072164948454
1486598,3,B00005JM55,"This delightful sequel was directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld (Kissing Jessica Stein) and picks up where the first one left off. Elle Woods has graduated and moved on to the real world. Although she has a mission - she finds that the real word is not quite fair or even honest.

With the help of her best friend Paulette played by Jennifer Cooladge (American Pie, Austin Powers) they discover that the world is clouded with corruption and deceit.
The bad girl is this film is a self-seeking senator played by the brilliant Sally Field (Forrest Gump, Mrs. Doubtfire, Steel Magnolias) She plays the bad girl to the hilt and eventaull learns a valuable lesson from the blonde, organized, anal and somewhat not clued in Elle Woods.
The film has its charm and some cute scenes with the dogs but overall it is nothing more than fun fluff. A good sequel though. However - the first movie is still the best. I admire Reese for taking on challenges. This character is really her too. (11-12-03)",1068595200,,1151,4.76

When she discovers that her law firm represents a client who uses animals to test their products, she heads to Washington with the hope of changing the law.
The first film was hilarious, with one laugh and unexpected twist after another.  This one is less funny, but I still consider it a success due to the charm and innocent naivete of Reese Witherspoon in the lead role.  In the first, they took a naive rich girl out of her environment and sent her to Harvard.  There, she overcame prejudice and narrow-mindedness to show everyone that she isn't as blonde and ignorant as she appears.  Eventually, she convinces everyone to be more like her.  Substitute the word ""Washington D.C"" for ""Harvard"", and you will have the summary for Legally Blonde 2.

It seemed to me that they were trying to leech off the funniest parts of the last movie and reincarnate them into the second. Plus, the new characters really don't add anything to the movie...at its core this sequel is a modified version of the original.
There's also stuff in there that, besides being disgusting, really adds NO value whatsoever to the film. Like Bruiser being gay??? Do we need to hear about dogs humping eachother??? NO! Each moment that went by of this movie, I felt a little more ripped off and cheated out of my money.

1486725,2,B00005JM55,"As far as political films go, there isn't a shred a realism in ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde."" I mean not one shred. A ripoff of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and the Eddie Murphy vehicle ""The Distinguished Gentleman,"" the second helping of pink-loving, dog-toting Elle Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon with considerable face-miming and exuberance, is an appallingly nave rendering of Capitol Hill.
But then the original ""Legally Blonde"" was appallingly nave, and deliberately so, about Harvard, and the court of law. And yet the first movie had breezy, spoofy charm about it while managing to use Elle's endless beauty knowledge in a clever, useful way.
The sequel doesn't.
The shift in locales, from college to Congress, probably has something to do with it, but there's a little less of everything in ""Red, White & Blonde:"" humor, warmth, romance, sex appeal. Witherspoon has this character down cold; it takes talent to sell both the smart and ditzy side of Elle, and the actress blends them. But she's come to the pageant alone.
Elle arrives in DC after she discovers the mother of her dog is part of a chemical study. She hooks up with a congresswoman and a hotel doorman to pitch a testing ban, using her feminine fashion wiles and Mr. Magoo luck to manipulate the House of Representatives. In an entirely unrelated subplot meant to capture the half of the crowd uninterested in the bulk of the movie, Elle plans her wedding to Emmett (Luke Wilson, who literally phones in most of his role).
Sally Field is the congresswoman, and Bob Newhart is the dog walker/doorman, who has gained political insider status after decades of eavesdropping; he knows, for example, which representative had a dog named ""Jelly"" as a boy, and what color lipstick another wears.
In a drama this kind of recon would all be a little insulting, but the avalanche of Elle's well-lookee-here! evidence drags the movie beyond farce. ""Legally Blonde 2"" seems to demand an investment in its animal crusade without having to play at all on the level about how any such legislation is conceived.

Since she wants the dog to attend her upcoming wedding, she immediately sets out to get her freed and heads down to Washington DC to make Congress pass a bill to ban animal testing, thereby freeing the dog.
Having been a fan of the original, I went into this movie with high hopes.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The first movie presented Elle as a smart person when it was something she was interested in who had to grow and mature to reach a new goal.  We could sympathize with her and root for her, especially as we saw her heart of gold come through.  Here, she just appears clueless, blindly going from plot point to plot point.  The movie also presents a very pessimistic view of our government.  Yet Elle is still able to proceed through in an oblivious manner.  The movie might have been more fun if the supporting characters from the first movie had come back, but they are basically reduced to expanded cameos.  Furthermore, the movie goes overboard in its PC agenda.  Basically, it's unbelievable.
The laughs are few and far between in this far inferior sequel.  Do yourself a favor and stick with the original.",1067904000,32,1226,4.577981651376147

The second Legally Blonde's plot is so ridiculous it is at times painful to watch. While Reese Witherspoon still plays Elle Woods to perfection, other actors are less than desirable. This includes Sally Fields who plays a role on Capitol Hill.

1486734,2,B00005JM55,"The main reason I was so disappointed in ""Legally Blonde 2"" was because I enjoyed the first one so much.  What could have been a humorous and heartwarming look at Elle Woods' first journeys into the real world of law turns into a ridiculous parade of sorority sisters, pink dresses, outrageous hairdos, and gay dogs.
In the first film, I liked how Elle started off as a superficial character and really had to prove that she was a smart, capable human being.  It was like she became an entirely different, more admirable person at the end of the movie.  In this sequel, she still has a heart of gold.  The whole premise of the film centers around her battle to make animal testing illegal so she can save the mother of her canine companion Bruiser.  What Elle IS missing in this film is the maturity level she reached upon graduating from Harvard Law.  I think this grown-up quality was necessary so as to not make her character seem so out of place in Washington DC.
And BOY does she seem out of place!  But since we have to suspend disbelief for the sake of Hollywood dramatic license, Elle does not get laughed right out of Congress (which is what would happen in real life).  It takes a little time and some silly stunts, but the older, more conservative figures do eventually embrace her and her position on the treatment of animals.
You may notice that there are a lot of simillarites to the first film.  First of all, there is a rude coworker, played by Regina King, who tries to rain on Elle's parade.  Selma Blair anyone?  There is also a hotel doorman named Sidney (Bob Newhart) who gives Elle vital information about the members of Congress.  He basically picks up where Luke Wilson's character left off in the first film.  But the biggest similarity of all is the plot.  Elle must once again dodge insults and nonbelievers in order to make her point.  In the end, it is her knowledge of beauty products (in the first film: perms, in this film: facials) that exposes the truth about a wrongdoing.
On the whole, ""Legally Blonde 2"" is completely farfetched.  It does have a few funny moments and lines of dialogue, but it falls flat and becomes too silly to be legitimate.  I've seen worse, but I think this film could have been so much more.",1067385600,3,2251,4.518518518518518

Don't get me wrong, I think Reese Witherspoon is fantastic and she did a great job - I just thought the storyline was a little overboard.  Personally, I wish the story had focused less on the dog, because while seeing the dog dressed up in pink is funny, it gets old when they try to plot the entire movie around it!

I figured wrong.
Partly, I think it was that the themes of the movie - politics and animal rights - really don't interest me that much.  I would have much preferred LB2 where Elle was still in criminal law as that would have appealed to me a lot more.  But another thing I liked about the original movie was the way it prized brains and showed the viewer that just because someone acts fluffy doesn't mean they actually are.  This movie seems to be completely going against that.  It's Elle's fluff, rather than her brains, which help her to save the day - one part that particularly annoyed me was that after someone accuses animal rights petitioners of using cheap sappiness and cute pictures to get people on their side, Elle goes and does exactly that in her speech for 'Bruiser's Law'.
The humour varied from brilliant (the sorority phone-in) to trying too hard (the whole subplot about Bruiser and the Rottweiler.)  The opposition to Elle seemed much vaguer in this film than in the last - Grace is faded out over the second half and seems a completely cardboard character, the congresswoman is won over way too quickly with some sorority connections...basically, I just felt the film-makers missed a golden opportunity and instead chose to play up Elle's wackiness and ditziness.  It wasn't a completely terrible movie, there were some good parts in it and the cast were impressive, but I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't very, very interested in cute lickle fluffy animals.  I'm not exactly for animal testing - it depends on what's being tested - but I resent trying to be won over by sentimental arguments.",1062288000,2,1864,4.731481481481482

1486802,1,B00005JM55,"I saw ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde,"" fully expecting it to live up to the first Legally Blonde. Instead, I came out of the theatre ashamed for pretty much everyone who was involved in this really horrible sequel. The first ""Legally Blonde"" was a great film... cute, sassy, fashionable, and intelligent. It had well-thought out characters, a smart storyline, and was filled with impeccable taste and fashion. In short, it was a completely enjoyable, fun film.
This one was nothing like the first, even though it's painfully obvious that the makers of ""Legally Blonde II: Red White and Blonde"" were trying as hard as they could to make it as good. Unfortunately, they must have tried too hard because they ruined the movie instead. The storyline was so stupid it was hard to watch. (It was also hard to follow in some parts- I couldn't tell if certain things were important in the story or just put in there to be silly. It turned out that nothing was important and everything was silly.) The jokes flopped, and the writers obviously knew nothing about politics. There were too many (new) characters (none of which anyone cared about) that were trying to be the same characters as the people in the first movie: the cold, unfriendly characters, the flamboyant characters, the self-centered misguided characters, and yes, even the Delta Nu sorority girls. I found all of these characters really boring. They certainly did not add anything to the movie. As for Elle, I got the impression that, after her graduation speech in the first film, she had grown into a confident, well spoken lawyer by the end of her 3 years at Harvard. In this film, however, she obviously regressed to the level of a ditzy Sorority girl (although personally I didn't even think she was that ditzy at the beginning of the first film.) In short, she was not the same Elle Woods that we knew in the first movie.
Of course, I have to mention the fashion in this film. Elle dressed really great in the first movie in some of the hottest trends. In this movie, however, she turned into a Barbie doll, wearing lurid pink fluff all of the time in some really hideous styles that went out of fashion about 30 years ago. Quite painful on the eyes. I walked out of the theatre seeing pink.
I could go on and on about how dissapointing this movie is, but I won't. I'll just say that if you loved the first Legally Blonde for all the right reasons (it was cute, smart, and fun) then don't see this film. I'm sorry I did and I'm going to continue to enjoy the first Legally Blonde DVD, ignore the fact that they made this sequel, and just hope they won't make another one.",1059523200,2,2645,4.570526315789474
1486863,5,B00005JM55,"This is a marvelous film that I found wonderfully funny and moving.  I laughed and cried during this film.  This film is a thoughtful yet entertaining look at how cynicism and hard-headedness in politics is destroying good government.  Some people apparently find the homosexual dogs part of the plot not credible, but scientists have come to the conclusion a while back that animals, like humans, have a percentage of their population who are not heterosexual.  This is not a matter of choice or how they were raised but a part of their natural makeup from birth.  Yes, some of the other situations in the film are more idealistic than realistic but that's the point of the movie.  Also, don't forget this is a comedy so it doesn't need to be as realistic as a drama.  Sally Field is also excellent, as usual, in her key role as well.  To me, the fact that this film has as much naysayers as it does tells a lot about the downward trend of society right now.  Oh idealists, where are you when the country needs you?  I think anyone who is in the mood for a thoughtful comedy and is not a cynic will enjoy this movie and some people hopefully may be as inspired by it as Arianna Huffington's children were.",1059004800,8,1206,4.465753424657534

I will admit that its energy feels a little weaker than the first, but that still doesn't mean it's not funny, touching, and highly enjoyable. As an animal lover, I couldn't help but be affected by it. The scene where we witness Bruiser's mom in the lab really got to me. It was depressing and heartbreaking to watch. The fact that I strongly believe in and support the cause our heroine, Elle (Witherspoon), is fighting for, made this movie that much more enjoyable for me. Real animal lovers should easily be able to relate and root for Elle. This movie is just so positive and inspiring. There's so many things I feel so strongly about, and Legally Blonde 2 made me want to get up and try to make a difference. If this movie could reach at least one person in each audience the way it reached me, then it did its job and will have been a success. If only more movies had good messages like this one.
I'm not saying everyone is going to feel the same way or be able to relate as well as I could, but hopefully it will be able to inspire quite a few. I'd actually recommend letting some younger kids see it. Maybe, just maybe, it can help make a difference. With such an honest main character who's not afraid to stand up for what she believes in, I certainly see it doing more good than harm. Yes, it's basically a fluff movie, but it also goes a little deeper than that. The more serious tone in some scenes worked well for me, and I found them quite effective for this kind of movie.
I remember a lot of people saying that the highlight of the first movie was Elle's Harvard video. However, while I thought it was funny and pretty amusing, I didn't love it as much as most seemed to. I personally thought the slides showed at the office for Bruiser in this sequel were much funnier, not to mention cuter.
Reese Witherspoon delivered another fun performance as Elle. This actress never fails to amuse me. She carried the first one completely on her shoulders. This time around though, the adorable dog playing Bruiser managed to steal pretty much every scene he was in. I think he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination ;), but unfortunately, he'll likely be snubbed. The rest of the supporting players were all fine and enjoyable, especially Bob Newhart as Sidney and Jennifer Coolidge as Paulette. But none of them could compete with their four legged co-star.
This nice, friendly movie made me want to stand up and cheer. It had a good message and stood for something I believe in. I found it funny and very entertaining. It left me with a smile on my face and feeling inspired to make a difference. A solid and harmless feel-good movie.

I love Reese and Sally Field (and they both put in fine performances), but I left feeling amazed that either would sign on to the project.  I can't put my finger on exactly what was missing, but this movie simply did not have the charm of the first one.

The story revolves around Elle Woods; a lawyer, a graduate, a blonde, a brainy girl, -only all under the stereotype of blondes- and though they aimed to rid of that stereotype (done more successfully in the 1st flick)- this movie was a joke, only it wasn't and just wasted precious hours. Her beloved dog's family is being used cosmetic testing so Elle decides to do something about it, i.e. she goes to Washington-the capital. It's hard to make the people believe in her charm once again wins them over but conflicts continue.

The plot may be very similar to the 2001 hit but the movie still isn't bad. Actually it's pretty bad- I didn't mean to rate it 4 stars- mistake- it's to be rated 2 stars- so don't get confused by that. Some fast remarks and supposedly funny jokes manage to save the movie (at the same time forcing it to sink) and lets not forget the 'Reese blonde charm'- that I've heard about and seen in OTHER places- e.g. her Friends appearance- but NOT here.

1486868,2,B00005JM55,"Reese Witherspoon returns in this sequel of Legally Blonde, it is titled LEGALLY BLONDE 2: RED WHITE AND BLONDE. The first movie, which came out in the summer of 2001, was a funny movie with a good plot and overall underlying message. This movie though, is close to a trainwreck.
The performances are strong, and it's fun to see the characters from the original come back. The story is incredibly weak though. Witherspoon's character Elle Woods is trying to find the mother of her dog Brewser, and finds out that the dogs mother is being used in animal testing for cosmetic products. She goes to Washington to try to pass a bill that animal testing be illegal.
This movie borrows way too much from the original. In the original, she found out near the end that a woman who killed her father was using a false alibi, by proving that she could not have had a shower if she just had a perm, because you need to allow two days between washing your hair and the treatment so you're hair isn't ruined. That was a cute part of the first movie, but its so redundant here, that she uses that part of her intelligence to learn the truth, is rather inane and a dumb plot point. It's used again here though.
Perhaps the dumbest comedy scene in the movie is when Elle and a Republican she met in the park (who both have dogs) find out from someone that their dogs are gay. I know the movie is trying to be cute but that wasn't funny but rather just ridiculous.
The first movie was cute because it was about a girl that everyone thought was just another dumb blonde ditzy girl, who went to Harvard and proved she had what it takes to graduate with honors and succeed. This movie follows the same formula, and it would have been better and more interesting if we had seen Elle undergo some sacrifices to get to where she did and find the result she wanted. Instead, we only have small minor set backs that are countered with ridiculous occurances that just happen in convinience to her knowing certain people.

I guess if they had tried to follow up the success of the equally ditzy/funny ""Clueless"" movie, they would have not succeeded, and they didn't here, either.

It feels as though this movie was named first...""Red, White and Blonde"", and then someone found a screenwriter who was willing to sacrifice their craft to come up with something, anything that would match the title.  They chose to move Elle to Washington, D.C., for a little ""Mr. Smith, Mr. Deeds"" action -- this time the crusade being for animal rights.  Director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld was successful with ""Kissing Jessica Stein"", but proves he can't direct what might have been a ""for laughs"" comedy.  All kinds of things get in the way, such as the
far-fetched warming of a curmudgeonly woman senator, who warms to Elle just because they were both Delta Nu's.  There is a sidebar to the animal portion of the story that deals with the sexual persuasion of Elle's chihuahua that was definitely not needed.

Elle Woods, America's favorite blonde, goes to Washington after she is fired from her law office for taking a stand against animas being used for testing cosmetics.  Already I loved this movie - a lawyer with prinicples - how rare is that?
Elle joins the staff of a Congresswoman (wonderfully played by Sally Field) to try and get a bill passed that would ban such testing.  But of course, Elle meets up with cyncial, self-indulgent and selfish associates.  She meets one roadblock after another.  But using the Elle Woods way, she doggedly (excuse the pun) persists until she is successful.
Elle refuses to accept things as they are.  She refuses to take the easy way out.  She won't compromise her principles.  There is more to this blonde than meets the eye. Far from being the ""Capitol Barbie"" as she is called, she proves to be ""street smart"" (even if the street is Rodeo Drive) and uses the skills that she does posses to acomplish her goal.  It is a joy to watch her operate.
Elle's major statement is about making a difference. One person can overcome odds to make a difference.  (see Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King).  When some people are told that ""it's pointless, just give up"", they use that as motivation to work harder.  Those are the kind of people we should be looking to as being leaders.

So well she has been just a little bit ""type casted"" (resulting in poorer sales with ""Sweet Home Alabama"" Nonethless a great film).  Reese is an actress on the rise and ""Legally Blonde II: Red White And Blonde"" she doesn't fail to live up to the first part of the ""Legally Blonde"" movie series (I'm hoping they'll be other sequels?).  In keeping with it's ""you can do it if you try"" theme, we find our heroine Elle Woods in yet another dilemma.

Determined to make a change, she heads to Washington, working as an aide to a Congresswoman.  Just like Law School at Harvard she has to win over the co-workers already there with her brains as well as her charm, and as time goes on the co-workers become impressed with her strong ambition and intelligence.  Writing a bill to ban all animal testing (appropriately titled Bruiser's Bill), Elle persuades Congress to vote for it.  Of course there are the typical cliche parts where someone tries to stop the bill and what not, but Elle gets the job done.  It's also very educational in terms of learning how our government system works, and I'm hoping it will inspire many young viewers to become activists and participate in the government in some way, shape or form.  In a world where it seems nothing can be done by one person in these times of war and greed, ""Legally Blonde II"" reminds us that if we try hard enough and have a plan, we can succeed.  In terms of humor I found the ""Legally Blonde"" sequel to be funnier then the first, but script-wise it left something to be desired.

1486946,5,B00005JM55,"Like OMG... this was like the greatest Legally Blond sequel ever!  Like who would have come up with the idea of a plot involving animal testing.  This subject is like so innovative.  It makes me wonder like why this hasn't come up in the public's view yet.  If there was like a club against animal testing or making clothes out of animals, I would so join it.
And it was totally awesome to see the lil taco bell dog again.  Can he be any cuter?  Although I was really disappointed when he didn't say ""yo quiero taco bell.""  It was also great to see MacGyver's buddy, Jack, again (you kno, the pilot guy).  I totally miss his mustache.",1057622400,,634,4.313559322033898
1486947,3,B00005JM55,"This film was not disappointing only because I had low expectations after seeing the previews and reading the critics' reviews. I often disagree with the critics regarding lighthearted comedies, but their lukewarm reviews are right in this case. This is a summer comedy meant to showcase Reese Witherspoon and it does that adequately, but the plot is very thin and it is sanitized so the potentially controversial aspects disappear. Most unfortunately, a strong supporting cast is severely underutilized. Several of the characters from LEGALLY BLONDE reprise their roles and their familiarity lends continuity to the story but also serves to remind us how much better that film was. In addition, the roles of Luke Wilson and to a lesser extent Sally Fields have no character development at all. Bob Newhart does a great job with his usual deadpan style but is only slightly less peripheral to the story.
The plot is simplicity itself. Despite her upcoming wedding to Luke Wilson, Elle leaves Boston after being fired from her promising job at a major law firm when she espouses the cause of animal-free testing of cosmetics to the potential detriment of the firm's relationship with a longstanding large client. Since this is a personal crusade for Elle out of loyalty to Bruiser, the chihuahua who is her constant companion, she feels compelled to continue her efforts to eliminate such testing. She thus decides to go to Washington to work as a Congressional aide and orchestrate a political crusade to change the laws that currently allow such testing as an alternative to voluntary compliance by the cosmetics industry. Of course, as a vision in pink in a town of dark pinstripes she is initially ridiculed as ""Capitol Barbie"" but perserveres.
Elle has to learn how the political process works, and soon encounters the usual intrusion of ""political reality and fundraising needs"" on any hope of our legislators making informed decisions based on principle, Thus she has to mobilize grassroots support to have any hope of success. The story actually has some potential, but is played for cuteness rather than either outright comedy. And every opportunity for an educational discussion the issues is avoided. (E.g the writers use the sophisticated technique of a discharge petition but miss a great opportunity to  aid the moviegoer's understanding of our legislative process.) It is as if everyone associated with the making of the movie believed that causing the audience to have to think might limit the movie's appeal.
I rounded up my rating to an extremely generous three stars for three reasons. First, it has some truly funny moments, several of my favorite actors are in the cast and does showcase Reese Witherspoon. Second, dogs in movies always have the potential to raise my rating and they are the key to this storyline - the Rottweiler is great. Third, it is always wonderful to find a comedy that succeeds without relying on violence, sex and/or profanity. So, if you have seen the previews, you have seen a lot of the funniest parts - but this is worth an investment of about eighty-five minutes of your time when you want to relax and smile a lot. However, seeing it once was definitely enough for me, in contrast to LEGALLY BLONDE which was both funnier and less contrived in proving that blondes can be smart and also have fun.",1057536000,7,3347,4.966131907308378
1486948,2,B00005JM55,"First off, I did enjoy the first LEGALLY BLONDE. I found it to be fun and somewhat originally. So when I discovered that a sequel was in the making I was naturally excited. My excitement, however, faded shortly after the movie started. While Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as Elle Woods in her crusade to pass a Congressional Bill prohibiting animal testing I found the unfolding of the plot a disappointment. This film has all the predictable characters  (i.e. the supportive husband and jealous co-worker who aims to foul your plans) and outcomes. Despite these flaws, I was especially offended by the portrayal...dog sub-plot that had no importance to the plot itself. Overall, I was very disappointed in LEGALLY BLONDE 2.",1057536000,4,728,4.967213114754099
1486949,4,B00005JM55,"Reese Witherspoon is on a roll with a sequel that is just as hilarious as the original.  This movie is funny without taking itself too seriously, original with its comic send-up on homosexuality in dogs, and totally enjoyable thanks to a supporting cast that includes the venerable Bob Newhart and the still perky Sally Field. Special kudos should go to Stanley Anderson as the congressman from Alabama, who in one of the film's classic scenes, 'outs' his dog.  This time around, Elle Woods is off to Washington on a mission to save Bruiser's mom from the horror of a testing lab.  With help from her Delta Nu sisters, even one in an unexpected place, she takes the town by storm.  If you liked the original, you'll find this one just as enjoyable.",1057449600,4,748,4.643939393939394

1486951,4,B00005JM55,"Reese Witherspoon is an amazing actress. She has charm, charisma, and attitude, which come off extremely well in her film roles. She's extremely versatile and can seem to do just about anything. And now she's back as Elle Woods in the sequel to one of her breakthrough roles--Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, which is as sweet, light, and fluffy as the original.
This time around, Elle is juggling a demanding career as a rising young lawyer amidst preparations for her wedding to the man of her dreams (Luke Wilson). But when she stands up for the rights of the other guy in her life - Bruiser, her chihuahua - Elle is fired from her job. She's devastated, but you can't keep an optimist down. In a wonderful spoof of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" Ms. Woods travels there as well, to take matters into her own well-manicured hands. Trying to learn the political ropes and win over self-serving politicians, Elle faces a formidable challenge. But with her clever and sassy signature blend of determination and intelligence, she bucks the system the Elle Woods way, inspiring those around her to find a voice of their own.

Directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, who had a modest indie success with the wonderful ""Kissing Jessica Stein,"" and written by script-polisher-about-town Kate Kondell, ""Legally Blonde 2"" moves at such a brisk, easy clip that there isn't much time to linger over its flaws. The story adheres strictly to formula, and the jokes are as cheap and fast as Elle's friend Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), but however lightly played, the animal-rights issue gives the film indisputable kink.
Although the film's politics are more inspiring than a flock of gun-toting Angels, they never get in the way of its silliness. Like a wait-listed designer handbag, the animal-rights plot provides Elle some stylishly correct, demographically savvy ornamentation. What's interesting here isn't what Elle is fighting for but the unshakable smile with which she wages her war. Elle has more changes of clothes than the four friends in ""Sex and the City"" combined and like them she's clearly happy to be female, nestled in the company of other women. She dresses in shades of sorbet and dolls up her Chihuahua like a bantamweight drag queen, but by fighting the good fight she's also giving alpha girls and women their due, rescuing them from the magazine horror stories and the taint of Hillary.
However empowering, alpha women like Hillary and Madonna don't make being a woman seem terribly fun - a lot of hard work, yeah, but not fun. Elle Woods does. Madonna's brand of stealth feminism made her an equal among male stars, but there's always been something exhausting about her need to outmuscle everyone in her periphery. You can see the same strenuous effort in Britney Spears' perfect triceps and the smiles of the teenage stars grimacing in the recent Vanity Fair. Witherspoon - whose production company is called Type A Films and who served as executive producer on ""Legally Blonde 2"" - isn't exactly Gloria Steinem, but not since Cyndi Lauper has a major pop figure projected such a blissfully happy, self-amused view toward being female. Elle knows you can have your Jimmy Choos and your equal paycheck too.
The film is silly and inplausible, but it's too clever and witty for me to care. After a disappointing number of summer blockbusters, ""Legally Blonde 2"" pleased, amused, and entertained, just like I knew it would. This is summer's guiltiest pleasure.",1057363200,8,3476,4.962264150943396
1487041,5,B00005JM55,"It is SO unfair to call this film a sequel, because it has it's own plot line, and although some characters are older, you could see this one without seeing the first.
This fact aside, ""Legally Blonde 2"" may well be the best movie of the summer, with Reese's excellent portayl of Elle, and who could forget Paulette? Full of bubbly humor and cute outfits, this movie deserves every possible award that exists.",1057363200,2,409,4.616438356164384
1487042,2,B00005JM55,"I was not expecting the sequel to be as well done as the first movie.  This is usually the case and therefore I would have been satified with even an attempt at trying to recapture all the elements of the first.
The first movie had the same wonderful elements like ""Clueless""  the star seemed like a shallow ditz but you started to realize that underneath was a brain and understanding of the world around her, however, so far, she had only used this understanding in her own world, yet when she turned it in other directions she soon becomae a succes in those areas.  This is what made the first movie such a surprise, you really liked the character, and Reese Witherspoons likeability only added to this.  The second movie ONLY relies on Rees's likeability.  This isn't a mistake as she has it in bucketloades.  But I would have liked to see her in a better sequel than this.
First they took the intelligent girl from the end of the first movie and turned her into an idiot who is trying to find her dogs mother so she can send her an invitation to her wedding...And it gets worse from there.  Where in the first movie she used her intelligence to get through tough situations, in this movie it's just lucky hapenstances.  Her doorman happens to know how to get a bill passed, one of the congresswoman she needs to sign onto the bill happens to be a former member of her sorority and they do a ridiculous dance of recognition in a salon, sure, a hardbitten congresswoman is going to suddenly squeal and dance around in public like an idiot.  Next we have her old friend the manicurist from Boston who gives congresswoman freaky haircuts for which they are so greateful they sign on to Elle's Bill, So THATS how laws get passed.
To say I was dissappointed would be putting it mildly.  It didn't even go so far as the fact that they got most of the bill making process wrong, it mostly has to do with the fact that they took a great character ""Elle Woods"" and turned her into the idiot that everybody in the beginning of the first movie wrongly thought she was.",1057363200,7,2061,4.428571428571429
1487043,2,B00005JM55,"First off, I'm a huge fan of the first Legally Blonde film. I adored Reese Witherspoon as the nave, flighty, well-meaning Elle Woods. However, I have to say, that I was very disappointed with this second Legally Blonde film.
This latest glimpse into the unlikely career path of Elle Woods finds Elle taking her signature style to Washington in hopes of liberating cosmetic test animals and thus allowing her chihuahua's mother (yes, Bruiser's mother) to attend her wedding ceremony. How's that for a premise?
While Elle's bubble-headed antics were endearing in the first film, they were a bit much this time around. Elle seemed to show some maturity at the end of the first Legally Blonde, but Red, White, and Blonde proved me wrong. Instead of coming across as lawyer-savvy the character was drawn as overly nave and little-girlish. Even the secondary characters from the first film (Paulette, etc.) were over-the-top and annoying in this movie. Let's face it....these aren't meant to be great pieces of cinematic history, but this one fell so short that it was too silly even to be the fun experience that I think it was meant to be.",1057276800,5,1135,4.8860103626943

Elle, a ditzy, but very intelligent and effective lawyer, is back and she takes her cause to Washington where she once again battles sleaze and corruption.  Bob Newhart plays a doorman to great effect as well.  I laughed out loud many times during this movie!
Anyway, although we both really liked the movie, I would have to say the first Legally Blonde is better.  Maybe it was fresher the first time around.  This movie doesn't recycle all (or any?) of the old gags, but the idea is not new.  Still, it is a very fun movie.",1057190400,,704,4.369230769230769

Anyway, the plot centers around Elle's search for Bruiser's birth mother. (She wants to invite her-the dog- to her-Elle- and Emmett's wedding.) Elle's search takes her to a cosmetic testing center where dogs are used for all sorts of experiments...including Bruiser's mom.

However, Reese Witherspoon is absolutely amazing! She overcomes the plot and makes the movie fun and enjoyable.  The whole cast was great.  I loved Jennifer Coolige, and Reese's two sorority sisters, Luke Wilson was adorable as always, and Bob Newhart was a great addition! He was so sweet! I wish that they would have played out Reese's and Luke's relationship more.  Bruiser was adorable as always and he plays a bigger role in this movie.

Of course, the audience was mostly female. Which brings me to this: why have all the professional male movie critics from the ""big"" newspapers dissed this movie?
You know, I try to be fair when the latest James Bond film opens. I know it's going to be over the top; lots of explosions and sex and a thin plot. It's meant to be brain candy, right?
So be fair back, boys; when a female film equivalent to a silly action flick shows up on the big screen, it's not trying to be ""The Hours"", so try to expand your mind and take into consideration who exactly the film was made for and WHY.

Terrific movie, I totally enjoyed myself at the movie theaters on it's opening day! If you loved the first ""Legally Blonde"" movie, I'm absolutely sure you'll love ""Legally Blond: Red, White, and Blonde"".
The plot is cute and fun, which is to be expected from a Reese Witherspoon movie (Legally Blonde, Sweet Home Alabama). At times it's a bit too fluffy and mushy to be taken really seriously, but that's how it's supposed to be! A chick flick with lots of fun and fluff! It's not at all disappointing.
All the actresses and actors did a marvelous job with their characters, giving each on a personality. We have friends from the first movie including hairdresser Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), and the two Delta NU Margot and Serena (Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach). And we also get new friends, including Sidney Post (Bob Newhart), Timothy McGinn (J Barton) and Renna (Mary Lynn Rajskub). All of them are tons of fun and added lots of color to the whole film!
The movie is rated PG-13 for mostly sexual innuendos but nothing as bad as the first movie. Still, I think parents would like to check this movie out first before letting really young kids to watch.
