2394591,4,B000AV2G8S,"Even though I have the other PraiseBaby collection DVDs, Born to worship was so refreshing.  They have new faces, even grown-ups are featured on this one.  My husband thought that the songs were for a more mature audience, but the kids enjoyed it all the same.  It usually starts and ends our days with worship and I find myself singing the songs during the day.  I really enjoyed the DVD and I hope they will be more to come in the future.",1152489600,,440,4.329268292682927
2394592,5,B000AV2G8S,"Our 14-month old son loves this series.  He only gets to watch them on long car rides, but they're a wonderful treat.  The music is beautiful and the video is ""real"" images of people, nature, and animals for the most part.  This is a great alternative to the Einstein videos if you're looking for one with Christian music.  The best part is the video starts right away and is only 30 minutes long.",1151280000,11,397,4.397260273972603

The music is great, the images are perfect for toddlers and we love how much of an educational tool it has become.  We have been teaching our child how to use some ASL signs to communicate.  Already, she can sign 7 more signs that she didn't know a week ago because of the images on the DVD.  She thoroughly enjoys it and gets so excited when she hears the music come on!

2394597,5,B000AV2G8S,Bought one of these discs st a consignment sale... as a result of its success with our son (now 6 years old) had to have the entire praise baby DVD set. Just loved the music and way it captures a baby's attention. Unlike other series this one makes strong attempt to show diversity with babies of all races and capabilities. Ultimately love the videos and would recommend over Baby Einstein line.  Although my fathers world is the best so if only getting one; get that title instead.,1476144000,2,483,4.551724137931035

2394599,5,B000AV2G8S,"Praise Baby was a life-saver for me as a first time mom! I would use it to calm my little one down when nothing else seemed to work. I could put Praise Baby on and set him in the area of the TV (sometimes he didn't even need to see it) and he would settle down and just listen to the beautiful songs. You can choose from a woman singing, children singing or instrumental. It helped give a little variation to it. I love them all!",1461974400,2,429,4.0

I will say, though, sitting and watching this as an adult, I feel like it's pretty trippy. Random adults pop up on screen grinning and waving...

My daughter-in-law had purchased them for her twins and since they were four months old, it has helped soothe and engage them.  The music resonates with me while I am there.

2394639,1,B000AV2G8S,"Our baby LOVES the God of wonders praise video.  I don't know why the producers decided to insert adults into this one, but I find it creepy that there is an old man making faces and waving and a middle aged woman doing the same.  the last thing I want for my 8 month old is for her to become familiar with strangers smiling and waving...

If that isn't a concern for you, then you may enjoy this one.  I think the creators were trying to make an extra buck by recycling the popular God of Wonders songs and format into this one.  they came up short in my opinion...wish this one would have had new songs and left the creepy adults out!",1356048000,9,636,4.138211382113822

The music is so pretty and relaxing. I think she was 6 months old when I started and she would watch! She has No interest in any other videos still! I have ordered 3 of these videos and she loves each one. She actually mimics some of the movements, she smiles & waves at the babies on the video. Its so cute. Sometimes my 6 year old son will even watch with her. I don't mind getting these uplifting & beautiful songs stuck in my head all day! I'm ordering more today!",1354492800,,616,4.099173553719008

She can be in a horrible mood and as soon as the dvd turns on it plays a few notes, she swings her head around and almost always gets a big smile on her face. This video is great to keep her busy so I can get some things done around the house. (she is actually watching it right now!)
I have tried two other videos from the Praise Baby Collection and this is defenatley her favorite. The songs can get annoying after hearing them so many times, but its still worth it to keep her happy. Plus she gets to learn songs about GOD. :)",1339459200,,625,4.008

Not sure how many times we have watched these, but one thing is for sure, we are not tired of them and its been over 2 years!

2394652,5,B000AV2G8S,"When I first watched the DVD, I thought it was strange. The scenes are really random 5 second shots of: a giraffe, paint dripping, a Down's syndrome girl walking, a lady blowing a kiss, fish swimming, a baby laughing, balls bobbing in water, fingers counting 1, 2, 3... Doesn't even match the music playing. But for some strange reason, my baby will stare at the screen, stretch out her hands to it and laugh. I remember that the baby didn't really get into it until she was maybe 4 months old, and in the beginning, she would only watch for one or two songs before wandering off to do something else. But at around 6 or 7 months, it entertains the baby long enough for you to take a shower and get dressed for the day - maybe about 20 minutes. Otherwise, my baby will crawl to the door of my bathroom and just pound on the door and cry for the whole time I'm in there. I was hesitant to use the video because the American Pediatrics Academy doesn't recommend allowing kids under 2 to watch TV. But I reasoned that this is more of a music video which helps the baby learn praise music and is better than just having her cry for 20 minutes. Anyway, it's better than a TV show (my baby won't sit through those), and it's not like you are letting the baby watch it for hours. Sometimes, when we do watch it together, I sing along or point out the different things on the screen so the baby learns the names of them. It's also great for when you have to cut the baby's nails. The video distracts her so I can cut both hands and feet without any struggles at all. I did notice that they try to be inclusive of different races of babies although all the adults are Caucasian. The video options allow you to have the music with a female lead vocal, a child lead vocal, or just instrumental. All in all, a must-have for every mom and a great shower gift!",1308096000,4,1846,4.232294617563739

Our 8 month old granddaughter kicked, laughed, smiled, reached out with her hands from her bounce seat, and RESPONDED without tiring of seeing it again and again.",1283212800,3,353,5.5
2394659,1,B000AV2G8S,I have a 16 month old & she loves the Trebellina DVD so I thought I might try this praise CD since she loves music.  She's totally not interested in this CD & I can't really blame her.  The music is good but the video is terrible.  It looks like an acid trip & the old guy smiling in the middle of the first song is weird.  I won't be purchasing any more of these DVD's.,1281312000,11,370,3.8289473684210527
2394660,5,B000AV2G8S,"My baby hasn't been born yet, but I purchased this after seeing how my sister's baby is mesmerized by this DVD. They are all songs that I like so it's not annoying, like most baby music ex: The Wheels on the Bus, anyone? I recommend it if you like contemporary Praise and Worship.",1267142400,4,280,4.30188679245283

I bought 2 more DVDs for my friends. My baby likes faces and she prefers ""Born to Worship"" of all the collection. Maybe when she's bigger, she'll appreciate the animals.

The Christian songs compliment the video. Nice rendering for infants and toddlers.

I started with the series by renting from Net-flix. Now I own it.

Of all the praise baby collection, my baby likes 'Born to Worship.' Perhaps its because of the babies.

My 3 month old is glued to the screen smiling and laughing at colors and babies in the video. She loves close-up babies. (WATCH her video)

When she sees babies, she goos and gaaa at them with smiles. She's even friendly at real babies. When we're outside, I think the mothers are wondering how she does that. Their baby only stares back at mine.

i also like babies/children from different races are shown. She's exposed to all kinds of people and that's a great thing.

Its worth the investment. Its the only DVD collection I will show until she is able to understand things. I will buy DVD for my friends too.

Children will be exposed to godly songs that give praises to God and his majestic creation. Values of respect for other people, for human life, and all created creatures.

when i like an item, i do write a lot.

2394663,5,B000AV2G8S,"Our 3 year old really loves this collection. It was the first DVD's she would actually sit down and watch. It's similar to Baby Einstein, etc.. but set to Christian music. She prefers Praise Baby to any other series like it. She's been watching it since she was almost 2, she's almost 4 now and still really enjoys it.",1251072000,,318,4.406779661016949

The music is beautiful, the images are great, and it's just the right length of time. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with young kids.",1242000000,,249,4.434782608695652
2394665,5,B000AV2G8S,"My 6 mo old baby girl LOVES this DVD.  It's a great way for me to buy time to make dinner.  She enjoys watching it in the nursery at church too, keeps her from getting fussy while I'm in service.  I LOVE the music this DVD plays - very soft, commonly heard popular Christian worship songs.  I listened to this DVD just for the audio before my daughter was even born!  The colors and images on the screen are asthetically pleasing for baby and have educational value too (letter, numbers).  I would purchase another DVD in the series again.",1228953600,,539,4.393939393939394
2394666,5,B000AV2G8S,"We love this DVD, and its our favorite in the series -- though they're all great.  The female vocalists in the Praise Baby series are wonderful.  The music is so beautiful and worshipful -- sometimes I just want it to listen to it even when my girl is napping.  We enjoy dancing together to it (though it is very slow paced... more like tender and slow worship dance.)  The images of children, babies, nature, animals are also very well done.  My 16month daughter enjoys them (though she doesn't stay glued to the set like she does with Baby Einstein -- which is why I often prefer them!)  This would be a perfect gift for any parents of little ones who love worshipful music.",1222128000,,676,4.455284552845528

As she grew, she began to 'interact' with the kids and animals, and now she gets so excited when I put it on. It's part of our morning routine to watch this DVD and worship Jesus. And we still use it to calm her when she's fussy - we cuddle up on the floor, and watch it together on nights when she just can't settle, and she falls asleep so quickly.",1207958400,,482,3.9285714285714284
2394669,5,B000AV2G8S,Our daughter loves this video!  The worship music is fantastic and captures her attention as soon as the music starts.  When she is fussy the video always calms her down.  We are extremely happy with the Praise Baby Product.,1207612800,,224,4.6923076923076925
2394670,5,B000AV2G8S,This series of DVDs is absolutely amazing.  My 6 month old daughter squeals with delight when we turn it on.  It's become a part of our morning routine.

2394671,5,B000AV2G8S,"We recently purchased this DVD for our 16-month old and she absolutely loves it.  I'm buying more just to save my sanity from having to watch it over and over and over.  Until now, she's shown no interest in TV...cartoons, Baby Einstein, nothing.  From the time she wakes up in the morning she's pointing at the DVD player for us to turn this on and gets so excited to see it.  She'll actually sit still on her own, which is incredibly rare these days, to watch this again and again.  I can cook dinner again!  Of course, the worship theme is the reason we bought this and is such a great thing to start her out on.  Highly recommend!",1190160000,,634,4.277310924369748

My daughter who is 3 is in love with this DVD. She loves to just listen to the music during the day while playing, and at night for bedtime she will ask to listen to it to help her fall asleep. She always asks for her praise baby music. I would also like to get the cd so my kids can listen to it in the car. It is a great assortment of songs. It was definitely a great purchase; I will be purchasing more from the praise baby collection in the future.",1189296000,,596,3.814516129032258

Crying, crying, crying.  So I bought this DVD to have worship music in the background, thinking it would just be nice to have noise other than the poor kiddos crying.  This DVD has calmed EVERY baby in our Nursery.  They love the images, songs and especially love when our volunteers sing along.  It has even calmed a few of our kids to sleep!
