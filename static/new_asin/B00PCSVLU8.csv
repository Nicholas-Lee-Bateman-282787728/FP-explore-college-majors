6797761,5,B00PCSVLU8,"Boys Behind Bars 2 is an example of what happens when the loonies take over the bin. And the movie's good at it, too, as it puts more emphasis on the psychological aspects of its story than just the spectacle (even if some images are pretty disturbing in themselves). Now add to this an ensemble cast really up to their roles, and a well-paced directorial effort that really gets the most out of its very limited locations, and you've got yourself a really nice little movie - well, nice at least if you can see through some of the more offensive and at times self-consciously trashy stuff and see the quite interesting drama beneath.",1422403200,,634,4.5701754385964914
6797762,5,B00PCSVLU8,"A sequel that surpasses the original in outrageousness, vileness, and all around mayhem. Jailspoitation master Wade Radford returns once again, and manages to create a sense of menace and an anything can happen at any time. Honey Bane as Ms Muncher is a blast to watch, as is the rest of the cast.",1421971200,,297,4.622641509433962
6797763,1,B00PCSVLU8,"This has got to be the WORST movie I've ever seen - poor quality picture and sound, NO story line - well just downright stupid movie - don't waste your money OR time - even if you get a used one!!!!  I'm not sure you can post ""0"" stars, but that's what I would give it",1421884800,,268,3.7857142857142856
6797764,5,B00PCSVLU8,"Okay folks, Darrell is back and hes as much as a survivor as ever. You meet him in a toilet block sizing up against Ross & Richard the twins. Ross is looking to become the Top-Dog, but doesnt realise just how cunning Darrell is. He easily gains control of the situation by dividing and conquering the twins, by using the latent or hidden homosexuality of one of them to unhinge the confident stability of the other.

 Just as an aside, whilst you're watching this film youll never look at a toothbrush in the same way again.

 You will encounter blatant uneducated homophobia, which if just a modicum of common sense was applied, would have avoided the entire situation from arising. To me as the viewer, this supremely highlighted to stupidity & futility of homophobia. But, its all part of Darrells plan to gain control of the situation, as two against one are not very good odds.

 The thing that was highlighted by this film, was that violence is a means to an end, a tool that depending upon its wielder, can be used like a heavy club or in Darrells case, a skilled surgeon using a scalpel. It is this skill that triggers the violence between siblings.

 Then enters the Wing Governor; Mizz Muncher. Who is equally as expert at using sexual degradation as a form of mental and physical control, her dominance reminded me of a very callous school principle. Darrell and the Governor looked like two tigers, circling each other, looking for a sign of weakness and an opening to attack. Its through their Exercises of Vital Powers, that ultimately determines who is Top-Dog, with one scoring the heights of ecstasy whilst the other becomes a tragic casualty.

 Ultimately, Boys Behind Bars 2 is most reminiscent of Ray Winstons, Scum, with Wade Radford most definitely being The Daddy!",1416355200,3,1787,4.735483870967742
