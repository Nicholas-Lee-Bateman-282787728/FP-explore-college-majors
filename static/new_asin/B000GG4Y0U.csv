2608759,4,B000GG4Y0U,"OK dis is what i think what happened, Flave & Chuck D made a bet. Flave said ""Yo Chuck, I bet you 5 supersized clocks that I can get 20 women on a tv show fighting over me."" Chuck said, "" Yeah right Flave, after Bridgette Neilson, i'll take that bet."" So he gets these 20 women together to vy for his love. I think his mind was made up as soon as he saw Hoopz who was gonna win this but he had to let the show run it's course. My two favorite girls were Red Scorpion & Hoopz. I love Asian women & Hoopz is just beautiful. I hated Hottie, I was sooo glad that Flave got to see her in her enviroment, gold diggin mamacita. All she had been talking about the whole time was how everything was going to be hers, the house, the cars & Flaves money. Finaly New York, I know somebody like her had to be there to keep the show from dyin but man yo, she was extreme & her Mom, holy cow. She was throwin out insults from day one & then Moms shows up & you see why New York is the way she is. Although I found it absolutely disgusting that pumpkin spit in her face, I felt it was somewhat justified for the way New York had acted during the entire season.",1164499200,3,1144,3.893162393162393

He did it the right way in Reality Tv&Will be alright in the bigger picture. the rest of Public Enemy should take heed&get on there own Reality show. flavor flav had the right idea at the right time&also is hooking up with some  fly babes.",1161475200,3,702,4.33587786259542
2608761,5,B000GG4Y0U,"Flavor Flav is back.

This is mindless entertainment at its finest. Enjoy.",1161129600,12,3600,4.609984399375975
2608762,5,B000GG4Y0U,"It's Flavor Of Love starring the one & only Flavor Flav and 20 beautiful women who are willing to do anything (lie, back-stab, cat-fight, snitch, etc.) to be the one woman by Flav's side. This show is HILARIOUS!

20 women from various backgrounds compete to win Flav's love through challenges (cooking, gambling, 5 senses, etc.) to win a private date with Flav and through intimate one-on-one sessions to see what each girl is really about - Which girl really loves Flav and which girl is there to pursue her own interests (modeling, TV career or Flav's fame & fortune). Watching each girl's fate unfold through the eliminations is what keeps my interest in this show. Some of the girls were:

NEW YORK - From day one, her focus was to have Flav for her very own. Making it clear that she would not ""play fair"" or ""make friends"", she creates as much drama as she can to eliminate the other girls. Her determination (& underhandedness) gets her as far as the final elimination (and subsequently another shot at Flav in Season 2).

RED OYSTER - She's sexy, has a thing for the color red, and was Flav's self-appointed in-house spy. She made it her duty to inform Flav of any & all shady activities that the other girls were up to - with Flav's best interests at heart, of course. Quite a shocker to find out that she was still married while she was on the show.

HOTTIE - Her appearance on ""Blind Date"" exposed her as a gold digger, A polygraph test revealed her as a habitual liar and her ""raw-chicken-with-veggies"" meal ceritfied her as the worst cook in the world. The whole ""I look like Beyonce"" thing was probably the funniest moment on the show.

SERIOUS - The ""misunderstood"" model. Though she claims she wasn't there to further her modeling career, she didn't make her intentions with Flav clear enough - if she had any intentions at all.

SWEETIE - Flav's mother said to him that Sweetie appeared ""desperate"" to win and during her final one-on-one she seemed to be coming on pretty strong with him, perhaps to stay in the competition. Maybe that was the reason she was eliminated. But I think Flav should have kept her (instead of Hottie) because despite her childhood trauma with chicken, she was a trooper and cooked it for him anyway.

GOLDIE - I loved Goldie! I think she should have won! Of all the girls, she was the most down to earth and (according to the polygraph test) the most honest. In spite of the fact that she got a little TOO TIPSY before the first elimination, she proved that she could hold her own in the competiton. She was sweet, very funny and quite sexy, as demonstrated by that HOT kiss she laid on Flav during his date with her & New York (Goldie, where have you been!!!). Her admitting to Flav that she ""just wanted to be his friend"" was what eliminated her but I think if she really wanted him she could have been the winner. Flav was obviously ""feeling"" her.

HOOPZ - The girl who came out on top. She was also very down to earth and very beautiful. She would not resort to the ""sexual tactics"" some of the other girls used to get Flav and that made her genuine. Her ace in the hole was when she went on the date with Flav & his mother after winning the ""chicken"" competition. She won over Flav's mom while being herself the whole time. Though later it would turn out that she and Flav were not meant to be, she deserved to win.

I won't say much about the ""spitting incident"", other than it made Pumkin the worst contestant on the show and possibly all of reality TV.

This DVD contains all of the episodes with uneditied language, some brief nudity, the reunion show (After The Lovin') and other extra features.

This weekend we'll see the conclusion of Season 2 - will New York win this time?",1160697600,15,3732,4.465491923641704
2608763,4,B000GG4Y0U,"This is a great dvd, it is almost all uncensored, you hear all the f-bombs drop. And some of the girls topless like the last review said. The problem was at the shower scene like it was metioned. They censored that the topless and it was the hottest part. Which I found ridiculus. I guess the last reviewer might be right, saying that they probably didn't sight a release, but if thats the case, that dumby pumpkin should have. Ive seen her topless, all naked in the blind date uncensored they show on ppv, and one of the other shows. I cant believe she didn't want to be seen in this one. Anyways, good dvd, good extras, well worth the watch.",1158019200,4,643,4.322314049586777
2608764,5,B000GG4Y0U,"this is the unrated first season of the flavor of love.

yes.. it is unrated as in all the language is there and most of the body shots are also uncensored.  New York's shots are uncensored and smiley's strip tease is uncensored.  However, pumkin is still censored and the one girl who jumps into the shower in episode 4 is censored.  Also, the girl who shows her [...] to hottie in the famous ""i look like beyonce"" scene is also uncensored.

anyway.. there are all 10 episodes, the reunion, and a couple things they didn't show about pumkin trying to act black and some more of New York's outtakes.  If you have already seen the season and the reunion the extras aren't worth it, and you should buy this only if you want to relive the season without the bleeps and censors.

i bought this dvd because i love the show and like watching the fights over and over again.

the show is hilarious and over the top at times.. and has one of the funniest reality [...] of all time, New York.",1157328000,11,983,4.333333333333333
2608765,2,B000GG4Y0U,"Before I buy this video, I wanted to see if those of you who have purchased this DVD, if it is truly uncensored?  I know that more and more, DVD producers call a DVD ""uncensored"" when in reality, they are only talking about letting the language fly free.  When in reality, most people looking for ""uncensored"" are more interested in the body parts.  :)

So how about it?  Is it truly uncensored?  Does the viewer get a glimpse of an ""uncensored"" New York walking around in her lingerie?  What about anything else?  The 3-some shower scene?

Thanks.  (and if its truly uncensored, I'll bump my star rating up!)  ;)",1156896000,,613,4.532110091743119
2608766,5,B000GG4Y0U,"What a wonderful programming choice you have made, when you pick up this DVD set.  This is one of the funniest, dysfunctional Reality Program I've ever seen.  This show is The Apprentice on crack!  My boy Flava Flav is one of the most self-named luckiest men in the world!  Now, I know he probably never bangs any of these women, and he's one of the ugliest men I've ever seen in my life, he really is a cool classy character!

This show was recommended by my boy, Bobby A, and his recommendations usually leave a bit to be desired, but this recommendation was right on!

Two thumbs WAY up!

2608871,5,B000GG4Y0U,"I have purchased this DVD through the VH1 website, and to be honest, I have to say that this is one of the best dating shows that tv really offered. With all the negative things that I've read and heard about Flav, he's put the past behind him, he's a true romantic and a big kid at heart. When I watched this show, I have to admit that this show has its funny moments like the episode where Hottie stuffed carrots and peppers inside the raw chicken, topped it off with Thai noodles, raw cabbage, grape jelly, olives and marshmallows, cooked the chicken in the microwave, and served it to Mrs. Drayton, and the episode where Hottie lied about everything from her measurements to her true intentions of wanting to be with Flav.

When you watch this DVD, you will laugh your head off, you will gasp in shock, even start to curse and yell.

Watching this set is a guilty pleasure. It's not the deepest watching in the world, but you will be entertained.

I doubt they would give him the time of day if he wasn't rich and famous!
All those chicks saying Flavor Flave is worth the ticket price! Those gals are some pretty convincing actresses and Flave just wants some pretty young thing on his arm.
He's as old as my dad.

Yeah Flave is lavishing these girls with his outrageous wealth in hopes of finding one that is feelin' him. Man that is too funny feelin' flave more like feelin' his money! Yes and I love his viking hat and oversized clock pendant. He bestows upon ladies who he likes or keeps the ratings skyrocketing which was the case for psycho miss New York! The tension between New York and Pumpkin is the most memorable scene in this season and rather ugly too I might add.

This show is good if you want cheap drama and tension that so defines reality TV.
It's a staged romantic premise with goregous chicks fighting over a rich but unattractive man.
Don't expect sophistication that is Romeo and Juliet or heartfelt sentiment that is Titantic it's a comedic dating show/reality TV so enjoy the ride!",1206489600,,1322,4.546218487394958
2608898,5,B000GG4Y0U,"This is the first season of the show that started all of the craziness on VH1 in 2006. Public Enemy Hype-Man Flavor Flav was dumped by his Girlfriend Brigitte Neilson on the 2005 reality show ""Strange Love"".The show brought in such high ratings that VH1 offered Flav his own love competition in a reality show called ""Flavor Of Love"".This debuted on January 1st 2006. It also introduced the world to Tiffany ""New York"" Pollard who got her own spin-off show in 2007. This had a 10 episode run along with a Reunion special.

This set has all 10 episodes along with the reunion show uncensored. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Rap music or any of the reality shows on VH1.",1205452800,,679,4.520325203252033

2608900,3,B000GG4Y0U,"He looks crazy, and although I like His wild personality, it's just like Miss New York's show; very Un-Love-like, deceitful, fights galore (Yay!), Crazy Women in line for Someone very ugly and with no rap talent whatsoever, and Who sports the biggest clock a Human could carry.

I find Him quite repulsive save for His fun side. This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy it. It was just not the greatest set up, just like Miss NY's silly show. Both - entertaining. Both - sleazy. Both went home empty-handed on the first season!

And don't EVEN start, cause this is a Black on Black hate crime! X^D
