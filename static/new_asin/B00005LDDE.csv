1621475,2,B00005LDDE,"Kid n' Play stopped doing ""House Party"" movies for a reason, because they were played out. This movie was made for USA television (literally), and you can tell that it was a vehicle to lift IMx to superstar status (which didn't happen until B2K came onto the scene a few years later). Marques Houston (a.k.a. Batman) is a good actor, but he can't save the movie. There's no Kid N' Play, which was the main disappointment, next to the generic humor and predictable plot. What's next, House Party 5 starring Lil' Fizz?",1043366400,4,516,4.619565217391305
1621476,5,B00005LDDE,"I am a true fan of imx and of course I'm going love it just because I am a true fan.  The movie is hilarious and its great.  I just know all the lyrics that was on the movie so that's another reason why.  I love them and all their work and I'm going to support them at everything they do because I show great appreciation.  IMX has been my favorite every since I heard their sweet sensation voice and I have been enjoying their music since.  If you are a true fan you would enjoy the movie just as much as me just because they are on there.  I am so crazy over them and I looked at that movie and couldn't take my eyes off of it. Well I think that all my words can't fit on this page so I will let you go until next time.

1621477,1,B00005LDDE,"I thought the movie was terrible. The acting is bad. The jokes weren't funny. The movie is only 79 minutes,and IMX's party doesn't even last that long. I wouldn't even rate the movie *(1 star),because it is terrible. I can see why it didn't make it to the movies. Kid and Play weren't even in the movie and they couldn't even get famous people to come to the party like in the other ones. The movie was the wackest movie I have ever seen. I advise everyone to rent this movie before they buy it . Someone rated this movie ***** and I think it was just because they are IMX's biggest fan, because the movie is wack. It would have never gotten any money if it made it in the theaters. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE.Don't buy it. It would be a waste of your money. trust me.

1621478,1,B00005LDDE,I expected this movie to be as funny and entertaining as the first three but... the comedic attempts were dry and weak. Which made this movie a TOTAL MISS. Save your money and rent it first to make sure you want to spend this kind of money for a horrible movie to add to your library. And I bet you will be happy that you did. The acting on every level was horrible as well as the storyline. Not to mention Originality ... there is only one Ferris lets keep it that way. The only twist was a mediocre party which in Ferris the parade scene was better. I can see where they tried to go with this one but they should have done a lot more studying from the previous three for a better outcome.,1009670400,4,690,4.080882352941177

1621480,4,B00005LDDE,"It was a decent movie but not the best.  IT was funny at times but did not have a good plot.  It was not orginal at all.  The movie was not orginally intended to be a House Party movie so people should consider that fact when comparing it to the other ones.  That is why Kid and Play were not in it.  But it did take alot of elements from that movie so that's why Newline decided to promote it as being part of the series to make it more marketable.  It also takes the idea from Ferris Bueller's Day off movie, which starred Matthew Broderick as  a highschooler who plotted to get out of school and also had to get an expensive car (that he took without permission) fixed.  [...] I think the acting was fairly good.  I mean it is a comedy and you don't need serious skills.  I loved the other movies and the acting was good but it was not oscar worthy or anything.  Marques Houston, the leader singer of IMx, was convincing and has had previous acting experience from Sister,Sister, House Party 3, Different World and Bebe Kids .  The other two who not had as much often sounded fake, particular Jerome, even though he had more experience (was in HOuse Party 3/Different World) than Kelton who never did it before.  Some of the jokes fell flat, but alot of it was still funny.  The other actors did a decent job. THe movie did not have enough obstacles or drama.  It was too easy for them to get away with what they did.  Also they could have focused more on the party.  All and all...I thought the movie was bad at first but after watching it again I have realized that it is a decent movie that combines alot of elements of past films.  It is not better than some of the other ones like House Party 1 or House PArty 3, two hillarious movies but it was a bit better than the second one. Even if you are not an IMx/Immature fan, you can enjoy the movie if you give it a chance.  I would only buy after seeing it [...] though.",996019200,8,1925,4.182065217391305
1621481,4,B00005LDDE,"One day, while I was surfing through the channels, I happened to find this on cable. Of course, it would not seem as if the movie would be any good because it is the third sequel. I found myself surprisingly enjoying this comedy.  Unfortunately, this has the same plot as the other three. A boy pretends as if he is sick so he can stay at his rich uncle's home while he is away. Little do they know that he has planned the ultimate party featuring plenty of popular artists. Soon, a series of hilarious mishaps ensue, making this movie worth watching.  There was enough humour to keep you motivated, but there were a few flaws of tis movie. One flaw included the acting. Some of the performances were fair, but there just some that were not very impressive. Among these are the three main characters, who are artists in real life. They do alright performances at times, but the majority of the time, it sounds as if they are reading off of a paper. Most of the time, the jokes they told were unfunny due to the flatness of their voice.  Another flaw is the unoriginality of the film. Despite everything, House Party 4 is very predictable and brings nothing new to the series. All they add is some new characters and a new setting. The most predictable thing of the film was the ending, which you could tell would happen halfway through the movie.  If you want the cast members from the previous films and powerful performances by the actors, then I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a low budget comedy filled with humour and mishaps and need to kill time, then I recommend this.",995760000,2,1611,4.484641638225256
1621482,1,B00005LDDE,This movie is god awful compared to 1-3. so bad i'm not sure a higher budget could save this movie. I think whoever put up money to make this should consider a career change. 79 min of anybody's life gone and wasted who watches the whole flick.,1360195200,,244,4.212765957446808

1621484,1,B00005LDDE,"BAD-BAD-BAD.... Down to the last second! It's time for Hollywood and everyone else involved in this stinker of a fiasco to JUST LET IT GO! The House Party legacy didn't deserve to be desecrated like this movie does.

Poor scripting, (or shall I say the lack thereof) coupled with awful acting (in some cases OVER acting) Makes for 79 minutes of pure GARBAGE, I've seen pigs eating better slop than this. What a complete waste of time and $$$.... Save yours!!! .......I threw mine away! ......But after one viewing I did the same to this DVD.",1179187200,2,541,4.635416666666667
1621485,1,B00005LDDE,"Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch, but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind.  House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off.  This final installment to the House Party series (which, honestly, ended after the first film) is by far the worst, not just sequel, but film released by Hollywood.  It becomes very apparent early on in this ""feature"" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion.  I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor.  You would think that by ""stealing"" themes and images from a funnier film, your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two.  With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a Hollywood film.  From his confusing and choppy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and recycled old/tired clich moments, all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films.  It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as ""Hannibal Crossing the Alps"".  It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.

So, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity?  Honestly, I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest.  To begin, I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off.  It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula.  That was a huge mistake.  When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience.  We think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one.  That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4.  In one instance we have John-John trying to have the ""biggest party of the decade"" while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, Grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer.  Again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic.  This is the confusion in which I speak.  Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story.  He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series.  One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.

I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture.  I listened to rap and R&B growing up, but the group ""Immature"" never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player.  Why?  I don't think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film.  Didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly?  Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor.  It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film.  Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film.  Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor.  Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ... well ... everyone else pretty much falls into that category.  The acting, I believe, was found at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box.

Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film?  Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the ""unforgettable"" House Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance.  House Party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down.  Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the ""escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver"" routine for humor?  Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance.  For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film.  House Party 4 buried the series, and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died.  Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future.  I think a sequel to Who's the Man? would get them started in the right direction.

YUCK!
