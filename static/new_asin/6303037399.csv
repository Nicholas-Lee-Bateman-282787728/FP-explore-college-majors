I ordered it, skeptically, thinking that even if it isn't Undefeatable, it would probably still be laughably bad.  But it is Undefeatable, so if you want 88 minutes of solid gold, order it now.",1169596800,3,260,4.630434782608695

543192,5,6303037399,"This is an instant cult classic. They tried their best to make the movie serious, but no prevail. It stars Don Niam ( Stingray ) a ruthless serial killer with a troubled past who is obsessed with his Mommy. He participates  in death matches and because of his uncontrolled rage he beats his wife.  His wife leaves, tired from the abuse. From that moment on he goes on a  rampage killing every woman with a flower dress because he thinks it's his  wife Ana or his Mommy? The rest is a suprise... Filled with action, cheesy  acting, and lines you repeat over and over with friends. LOL! Enjoy with a  large body of friends.",917827200,16,621,4.4035087719298245

543385,5,6303037399,"Ok, I'm going to make this as simple as I can because I'm sure everyone has already said the same things over and over
""The acting sucks!""
""Dialogue is horrible!""
""Whats with the writing?""
""Why can't they stop yelling when they fight?""

So I'll just tell it to you straight. This movie is the best/worst movie of all time. It has so many parts that are genuinely entertaining (fighting) and mindbogglingly bad (dialogue) that it manages to be more entertaining every time you watch! The production quality is so bad that its hard to call it a B movie, more like a C or something. The performances are solid from Donna Jason, Cynthia Rothrock and Don Niam, but the main guy who plays Nick DiMarco (forget the actors name) cannot act his way out of a cardboard box. He alone is hilarious from his wooden performance to his final ""Yeah. C'ya!""

Ok let me try to get it across on a simple level that bad movie lovers will understand. If I had to compare it to other bad movies it would be like this: Troll 2 is entertaining because its so ""what were they thinking"" stupid, Samurai Cop is entertaining because its train wreck bad, but Undefeatable finds such a tight balance of every negative in film that its been reversed and ends up being an entertainingly awesomely terrible film that EVERY B movie lover should own.

If you have not bought this movie yet then there is something wrong with you. Get it. GET IT NOW!!!",1345334400,7,1416,4.501945525291829

543387,4,6303037399,"Martial Artist throughout the world now Cynthia Rothrock (one of two non-Asian Queens of MA) who is well know for combining Chinese Martial arts with Karate. If you ever attended a B, AA or AAA martial art tournament on the west central west or east coast worth anything she was there. I met her and Keith Cook at two of these events when I was an (Hung Gar/ Tang Lang) exhibitionist in the late 1970's until mid 1980's.

I can honestly say few people know about the Hung style (except of watching Shaw Brothers movies). Nor are people familiar with several of the Hung systems subdivisions. let's meet  Sifu Don Niam. Sifu Niam is a master of Hung Fot Kung Fu (10 animal system)  which is one hardcore subdivision. If you are familiar with Hung Gar (5 animal-5 element system), Hung Kuen or even Choy Li Fut (5 animal systems)  you will be entertained by this movie. Although a ""B"" rated movie it delivers in power and shows you that this system was designed to be fluid as well as take and deliver punishment. The acting of Sifu Niam and Sifu John Miller (who is also a Hung martial artist) both need a lot of work. I guess that's why Sifu Niam is not well known except for in the MA cult classic world.  However if you like action, this movie delivers.  Also, for people who know the true meaning of WuShu and Kung Fu you will understand why I didn't say Gung Fu (which is the correct term for southern systems) - Except can be interchangeable for systems which incorporate northern and southern techniques i.e. Wu Shu Wu meaning 'martial' = techniques/skill and Shu meaning 'art' of war/fighting",1326844800,4,1599,4.515570934256055
543388,5,6303037399,"This movie is by no means a good film, it is however an entertaining film. The acting, action, stunts, and dialogue are sub par to say the least. I bought this movie because I collect crappy films, yes you read that right. This is a must have for anyone who likes B movies. You will not be disappointed in your purchase at all. If you're looking for a quality movie though move on.",1306713600,,381,4.232876712328767
543389,5,6303037399,"They just don't make great cheesy martial arts flix like this anymore. From 84 til 94 were the best times for direct to video action movies. I was never one for the Hollywood blockbuster hype movies with the big starts. Hollywood is all politics that picks who we see, and what we see. Independent films exposed us to some great movies and talented stars that Hollywood just blew off.

This movie is a lot fun, with notch fight scenes from REAL martial artiest. 5 out of 5 starts lol",1297468800,2,483,4.426966292134831
543390,3,6303037399,"Thanks to the internet, a little-known martial arts flick from 1993 gained widespread publicity as one of the most unintentionally funny things ever put to celluloid, but as goofy as ""Undefeatable"" is, there's more to it than its Youtube clip conveys. Most folks who LOL it haven't seen a Cynthia Rothrock movie before, much less anything directed by Godfrey Ho, and can't describe anything about the movie beyond that single silly fight scene. The film doesn't exactly have universal appeal, but apprehensive fans ought to know that, for all of its flaws, ""Undefeatable"" is actually one of the more entertaining offerings from this stage of Rothrock's career and one of the best that Ho has ever directed.

The story: When his wife leaves him, the psychotic fighter Stingray (Don Niam,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baja-Run/dp/B00008G8BJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baja Run</a>) goes on a murder spree targeting every woman who resembles his departed woman. When the sister of a notorious gang member (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) becomes one of his victims, she and a righteous policeman (John Miller) scour the city's underground fighting locales to find him.

The film's style is a continuation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honor-Glory/dp/B00122M24C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honor & Glory</a>, a previous Rothrock/Godfrey collaboration that featured many of the same cast and crew members. That one may actually do ""Undefeatable"" for all-around goofiness, but both are among the soundest offerings of director Ho. All the people out there proclaiming this to be the worst movie ever obviously haven't looked into the man's earlier filmography, for even though this one features overacting galore, iffy production values, plenty of silly situations, and a general low-budget feel, at least all of its scenes were filmed specifically for this movie and the characters' dialogue wasn't decided during post-production. It never had a chance at any awards, but for a Hong Kong movie co-written by someone for who English was a second language  (Tai Yim) and filmed in America by a Mandarin director, it really doesn't look too bad.

There are ten pretty decent fights to be seen, but with the exception of the final two, they're all rather short and don't feature any established talent besides Cynthia. Luckily, most of them are still fun to watch thanks to their indulgence in absurdity, like when Cynthia battles a fellow in football gear for money and an eagle claw master (wearing clawed gloves, no less) on top of some barrels. Her solo faceoff against Stingray may actually be the best fight of the film: though it includes a silly slow-motion shot of a snowfall of packing peanuts, Rothrock wields her favored hook swords and duels a katana-wielding Don Niam. Niam seems like a good martial artist but his movements are too stiff to be taken seriously, and his physical stuff takes a backseat to his completely overblown facial expressions. The infamous final fight between Miller, Niam, and Rothrock is an inexplicable drop in quality; I can only assume that ol' Godfrey was tired of holding back and just cut loose for the film's final five minutes, demanding that Miller and Niam scream their lungs out while pantomiming their choreography.

It's great that this movie made it to wide-release DVD. It's definitely not the most dignified vehicle to do so, but with luck, its gravitating absurdity will draw in potential new fans to everybody involved. Rest assured, Cynthia Rothrock has done better (not so much Mr. Ho), but for anybody wanting a short break from her more serious work, this one makes for a fun 90 minutes of time-wasting.",1277510400,2,3875,5.6058020477815695
543391,5,6303037399,It is about time this gem of a film is being released on DVD in the states. My friends and I absolutely love this movie!

7835802,1,6303037399,I hate that I purchased this movie.  I read a review I thought was credible for the genra only to discover that it was totally incredible.  This is the worst MA film ever that even gets the time of day to even be up for review.  No wonder why in real time I never heard mention of it. Do not buy or think that it may be cool to watch just for kicks...it's not. Even for the Cinthia Rothrock fan I can't imagine this  being enjoyed. Stay away from this.  The whole reason for purchacing a MA film is lost here. Fight sequenses suck and are correographed horribly.  You can watch 8=10 years olds reinacting martial arts the've seen(not been taught) and you'd get a better rise. This film is absolutely horrible. I'm shocked that people would even allowed this project to be green lit.  Buyer be ware.  You've been warned. Absolutely atrocious!,1371600000,,841,4.450980392156863
7835803,5,6303037399,"This film really exposes the seedy underbelly of the world of illegal street fighting. As a person who was seriously considering putting my siblings through college using my street fighting winnings it really opened my eyes. Don Niam's tour de force performance as Stingray was clearly the inspiration that Sir Anthony Hopkins used for his portrayal of Hannibal Lector in Silence Of The Lambs. It gave me chills to look into the cold eyes of this deranged mullet wearing monster. How Niam was snubbed for an Oscar is beyond me.
Cynthia Rothock as Kristi the waitress/martial artist is amazing and reminded me so much of Meryl Streep I had to double check the cover of the DVD to make sure it wasn't her. John Miller as hard hitting handsome Detective Nick DiMarco steals almost every scene he's in. I hear during his time with The Royal Shakespeare Company.  his King Lear was the talk of England.
After watching this thrill a minute film my emotions were a complete wreck. I laughed, I cried, I was moved and terrified all at the same time. I was left with a choice in life, continue as a street fighter or change my ways? Well things turned out alright. I informed all my fellow gang members that I was quitting the gang and had enrolled them in college. Then they told me they'd also enrolled me! We all shared a big four way high five and and will soon graduate from Yale.",1368662400,4,1376,4.548387096774194
