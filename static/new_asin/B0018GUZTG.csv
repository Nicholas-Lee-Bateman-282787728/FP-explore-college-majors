8269740,5,B0018GUZTG,"This is such a cool dvd. I bought it after I had visited my daughter in San Diego, traveling on the Surfliner. The trip was filmed from the cab, and it gives the feeling that the viewer is sitting right behind the engineer. Very cool and very informative. It is almost as good as being on the actual train, but better because it covers more territory than the trip I was on. I departed the train in Solana Beach, but the train in the film goes all the way to the San Diego station, so I was basically taking the trip twice and seeing more.",1496275200,,539,4.142857142857143

8269742,5,B0018GUZTG,I bought this a few days ago and it shipped fast!  I watched all the features of it and its so wonderful!  I recomend this to anyone who likes Amtrak or the Pacific Surfliner.  It is looking direct ahead the entire ride and it comes with special features to watch along with it. Do buy it because it is perfect for any railfan,1389225600,,326,4.142857142857143
8269743,5,B0018GUZTG,"Fantastic cab ride video. The camera is totally ""locked down"" for the entire trip from Los Angeles to San Diego. It's in real time too, so you see every inch right through the locomotive window. I loved the 70+ MPH sections. Lots of background radio chatter if you're into that sort of thing.

There are some extras one of which had the camera going through the power plant of the locomotive, and through the cars. I would recommend watching that only after you've seen the same the main section.

The one aspect that sets this cab ride video apart from others is that there are on-screen indications of blocks, signals and speed. Very unique and informative.

Only drawback is that when the train is going very slow through sections (like out of LA and as it gets close to SD), it can be a little boring. But you can fast forward through that part.",1356220800,,849,4.5
8269744,5,B0018GUZTG,"An uninterrupted cab-ride from LA to San Diego depot. As a cabride it is great, no interruptions just the view ahead on this magnificent coast-near division. The only minus is the rather slow approach to San Diego due to a freight train ahead, but OK you can use the FF button if it is tiring. Grat to see San Diego again. Can be recommended as a classical cabride.",1345680000,,365,4.382352941176471
