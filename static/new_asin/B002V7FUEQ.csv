Maddy Ventures is a great plan B for someone who is hungry for that adventure yet loves the comfort of their couch. This disc is a 4 film bundle, a stellar deal in itself, and it takes you through bustling Manhattan as well as the calming comforts of the beach. Eastern beaches seem so much more picturesque than west coast beaches, and this disc enforces that stereotype. The producer has a great eye for cinematography and it shines through in these films. It's enough to convince me to go take a look for myself!",1394755200,,587,4.4953271028037385
