8522928,3,B007XIO8XW,"This is a pretty good DVD in the sense that it's got some great classic Yankee footage in it (Mantle/Dimaggio/Ruth/Ford, etc), and attempts to take on the task of addressing Yankee World Series history (which is a LOT of series over the last nearly 100 years), but if you're looking for anything substantial after the end of what's termed ""The Golden Age"" here (referring to the last great Yankee teams of the Mantle/Berra/Ford era), you are probably going to be disappointed, as they blast thru the 1976-78, and the Torre era in about 2 1/2 minutes at the end, with speed that made the segment feel like an afterthought.  It says on the packaging there's an 'overview' of the ""Resurgence"", and 'overview' is playing loosely with the term.  Maybe it has something to do with access to/clearances on Series footage?  I'm just speculating, and i have not read the book that this video is a supplement to.  There are some other good places to get more Yankee history on DVD (including a set devoted to the Torre years) so in my opinion, this is a decent/inexpensive but not essential addition to your Yankee library - here are some links to other sets (i liked the 100 Years of the Yankees set).
