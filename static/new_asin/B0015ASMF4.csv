8258012,5,B0015ASMF4,Once again like another review I just did you need to buy anything with his name on it. He is the best submission grappler Coach I have ever seen. And I've trained with some really great ones,1502582400,,191,4.1891891891891895

8258014,5,B0015ASMF4,I greatly enjoyed the dvd and customer service!  Thank you.,1426204800,,59,4.9
8258015,5,B0015ASMF4,Eric is excellent as usual. Clear and to the point. I wish he had more videos to offer. All his stuff is outstanding.,1402099200,,117,4.130434782608695
8258016,5,B0015ASMF4,Paulson knows his stuff and doesn't hold back any info. The dvd is loaded w/neck wrenching material for a lifetime of study. A need to have for any RMA or MMA teacher or student. I found myself laughing at some of his comic delivery style on a serious matter. Definately a favorite of mine. Can't go wrong w/ any of his material you can tell he has a knack and love for teaching. A ONE OF A KIND DVD ! You will not be disappointed. Also Judo Gene Lebell and Larry Hartsell's book cover a good a mount of neck cranks. When in doubt crank it out.,1297555200,3,544,4.093457943925234
8258017,5,B0015ASMF4,I have been a fan of Erik's for years. He is one of the very top MMA experts in the world. This is a very professionally done instructional DVD. There is enough information here to keep you busy training for several months whether you are a newbie or an old timer like me. It is all very practical and effective. I have never seen a better martial arts instructional. Highly recommend.,1208390400,5,385,4.436619718309859
