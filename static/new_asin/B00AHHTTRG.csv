5424768,5,B00AHHTTRG,Iranians are one of the most misunderstood of all immigrant groups. This fantastic film gives a brief history of how thousands of Iranians ended up in the US. It's a movie that appeals to all ages. I especially recommend it for schools.,1355961600,2,236,4.642857142857143
5424769,5,B00AHHTTRG,"It was really great to get different perspective from different Iranian religions and yet they were all very similar. I am glad that this showed some other side of the Iranians in US. That how they are about family and food..... Wished that more people spoke and gave their side of their story.
It was great and informative. Love it.",1355875200,2,333,4.566666666666666
5424770,5,B00AHHTTRG,"This program was at once entertaining and educational.  The brivht, talented, educated Iranian Americans interviewed made me proud to be Iranian American.",1356134400,,154,6.0
5424771,4,B00AHHTTRG,"I enjoyed watching.  It was informative, made me laugh and feel sad - brought out a range of emotions.  I thought it was well done, however, I would have liked to have seen  not just the celebrity, the wealthy, but also just everyday Iranians in ordinary jobs and even struggling to show a more complete, more realistic story.",1356134400,,326,4.586206896551724
5424772,5,B00AHHTTRG,As an Iranian American living in the States for over 35 years I have endured movies and documentaries that show a side of Iranians that is even foreign to me. It is nice to see finally a film that focuses on people I can relate to and feel that they have experienced the same things as I have. Thank you Andrew Goldberg and PBS for showing interest in a group of immigrants who have so much to offer.,1356048000,,400,4.141025641025641
5424773,5,B00AHHTTRG,"The Iranian Americans is a great and entertaining documentary; everyone must watch it! Many people don't know much about Iranians, and if they do it is associated with negative things such as the Iranian government and its supposed nuclear weapons. People also believe all Iranians are Muslim. Iranians come from diverse ethnic groups, religions, and backgrounds. On the documentary it talks about how Iran had a significant Jewish population, but many of them fled to places like California and New York during the 1979 Revolution, just like the other religious groups such as Muslims of course, Bahais, Christians (most of them Armenian and Assyrian), and Zoroastrians. The Iranian Americans also talks about aspects of Iranian culture with a lot of humor, such as how Iranians are very hospitable and love feeding people, and how they never want their children to leave the house until they are married. It is a great documentary that showed who Iranians truly are, without the negative stereotypes.",1356048000,2,1002,5.191358024691358
5424774,5,B00AHHTTRG,"This documentary beautifully highlights the multitude of perspectives, range of emotions, and breadth of achievements of the Iranian-Americans, and the internal struggles common to any immigrant culture. Anyone interested in stories on resilience of human spirit, multiculturalism and what makes America great would enjoy watching and sharing this movie. Also, would highly recommend as part of a school curriculum on multiculturalism.",1356048000,3,435,6.147540983606557
5424775,5,B00AHHTTRG,"I saw the PBS special "" The Iranian Americans"". First of all, as an Iranian/American I appreciate PBS and Andrew Goldberg's effort in making this documentary. For once, there was a realistic view of who we are, where we came from and the difference we have made in this country. I am glad they interviewed successful Iranian/American's who have made a difference and a good name for themselves in both communities. Often our contributions, education and culture is misunderstood. Often we have been portrayed as terrorists only and this film gives a whole different and a more realistic  perspective of who we are. Thank you Andrew Goldberg and PBS.",1356048000,3,649,4.954128440366972
5424776,5,B00AHHTTRG,"I completely disagree with the review titled ""me first"", which is a very unfair opinion on the film.  Comparing this to Shahs of Sunset is extremely unreasonable and irrelevant.  This film does a great job portraying the true story of countless Iranian immigrants, and even includes several Iranian minority groups which was great, since they are not as well represented in a lot of media about Iran.  Where as the negative reviewer states that only wealthy Iranians are portrayed, clearly he/she forgot the whole discussion on the hardship and struggles many of these immigrants faced when first arriving: unemployment, struggling to find a place to stay, sharing a 1 bedroom with an entire family to name a few.  There is nothing wrong with showing how this immigrant community has been able to find their foot hold in America in such a short period of time to become such a positive, successful and beneficial people in American society.  The film goes beyond politics to illustrate some of the most important aspects of Iranian culture: the holidays, food, the family are examples.  Ultimately this film will make any Iranian even more proud of his/heritage and educates non Iranians about an ancient, rich and entirely prevalent culture in a day when positive representation can be so hard to come by.  A great piece of work.",1356048000,7,1330,4.963963963963964
5424777,5,B00AHHTTRG,"Most Americans knowing very little about Iran,should watch this informative and entertaining movie. You learn about the diversity of religions and ethnic groups in Iran while being touched at the immigrant spirit to succeed. Unlike many immigrants to the U.S. many Iranians were surprised when the Ayatollah came to power and fled in a hurry, always hoping to return. Like Firoozeh Dumas' books, you see the warmth of a people who celebrate the family's blessings with lots of food and dancing, highly value education, and become model American citizens.",1356048000,,554,5.235955056179775
5424778,1,B00AHHTTRG,"I would hardly call this critically acclaimed!
Once again a few successful/wealthy Iranians are paraded as the representatives of Iranians in the West. In PBS's Iranian-Americans the demographic picked to represent us is quite unrealistic since it is mostly religious minorities with healthy representation of the Jewish-Iranians. Iranians are 99% Shia Muslim and that doesn't change much within the several million expat community world wide. But interestingly Iranians are not very religious. In almost 40 years that I have lived here I don't know of any Iranian women who wear Hejab, yet this documentary manages to put a Muslim Iranian girl in Hejab. Fair and balanced or have an agenda you decide.
 With all due respect to the distinguished guests, we are tired of seeing the same three people over and over again. How about stepping outside the narrow Hollywood mindset and find some normal Iranians.
The attempt by the media is to make Iran seem something other than the country it is. A fictitious breakdown based on religion, wealth and education to feed the gullible. To portray Iranians living in Iran as savage fanatics and remind us all that the good Iranians left and came here. This paves the way for future adventures in that part of the world. An attempt to dehumanizes Iranians and to make it an easier sell for sanctions who are effecting ordinary Iranians and waging war on Iran to appease the Neocons. A war on our families, the middle class Iranians who, revolution or not, couldn't afford to uproot and move to Brentwood. The conservatives are already on board lets change the mind of the Liberals through channels like KPBS and NPR.
On the other hand the Iranian-American super class dictates who we are from their upper echelon by means of manipulating Iranian-American voice. The elite in the West use their wealth and influence to create an Iranian culture that is very narrowly representative.
The credits of this TV show mention one of the wealthiest Iranians, a real estate tycoon. Yes we gloat in their real estate successes while the rest of the country burns in mortgage bankruptcies with no little fault of greedy developers and bankers. What part of being American didn't we get?!
The company that made this film is in the business of making films with a clear agenda, just check their website and it is as clear as day what they do. I hope you are bright enough to see and not choose to look the other way.
The author who is interviewed in the film, on her fb page calls me a hater while relentlessly trying to sell the film. What is funny is that I am one her biggest fans and have purchased many copies of her first book and given it out as a gift(found the 2nd so boring couldn't get passed the mid-point). She however is being used to make a point that is not very pro Iranian. The subtleties of media manipulation has missed her as well as many viewers by a mile.
The comedian interviewed goes around saying he wants to break stereo types but every role he plays is exactly the stereo type Hollywood creates for us. We sell out quickly to money.
The truth is that the interviewed CEO from the bank does not represent me or many Iranians I know. A CEO of a bank who is responsible for the misery of thousands who lost their home is not a jewel in my crown. Big banks are unethical and so are those who support them.
Iranians who belong to the 1% or their cronies are bad for Iranians as well as Americans and shame on those who praise them. Iranians are making themselves to be shallow, vain and naive when they root for money relentlessly. Shahs of sunset or Shahs of PBS, one and the same when glitter of gold is blinding the lights of dignity. We are the Shahs of Sunset, we just don't like to be reminded of that. It is a sad reality that one must be a  patron of a particular elitist circle with the real-estate and the bank accounts to back it, in order to have a voice in the Iranian-American community. Like one such organization represented by such people keeps reminding us ""It is OUR Farhang"" yet we have no voice in the so called Farhang!",1355961600,5,4090,4.593707250341997
5424779,5,B00AHHTTRG,"This documentary was a revelation and a breath of fresh air. It was engaging, touching, and humorous. It provided a nice introductory overview about Iranian-Americans and their lives past and present. It gives an alternative and positive viewpoint of Iranians outside of the dominant narrative in the US media that is negative and focuses on revolutions, war, and internal repression. I also liked how the program reflects the diversity within this larger community. I hope that more editions will follow because there are still so many more stories to tell. I agree with other users that this would make a good addition to schools and libraries.",1355961600,,646,5.10377358490566
8551619,4,B00AHHTTRG,It's not the kind of thing you want to watch over and over again... but I'm still glad I bought it! It's great and it came in great condition.,1410393600,,142,3.9310344827586206
8551620,4,B00AHHTTRG,"A very interesting, balanced view of what it must have been like to come to this country at a time when the only home you ever knew was in a precarious state of affairs.
Coming here for two weeks, staying for thirty years....quite a change in one's mental paradigm. The resolve, ambition and adaptability of Iranians, coupled with the pride they feel towards their heritage, makes for a successful assimilation into American life.
America is a better place because of the intelligence, innovation, strong work ethic, and dynamic personalities of the Iranians who came here and have contributed richly to the progressive, innovative culture of our great country.",1410134400,,661,5.12962962962963
8551621,5,B00AHHTTRG,This documentary really captures the unique spirit of culture that I find in my Iranian-American friends.  I highly recommend it.,1393459200,,129,5.45
8551622,3,B00AHHTTRG,"Good review of events and struggle.  But, could have gone deeper.  This just skims across the surface of the experience.",1372118400,,120,4.95
8551623,5,B00AHHTTRG,What a great documentary! I counted down the days for the airing of the program and am so happy I invested in the DVD. I am proud to be able to share this with my friends and keep history interesting for the generations to come.,1360972800,,228,4.088888888888889
8551624,5,B00AHHTTRG,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary on Iranian Americans. It gives an accurate and emotional account of the experience of Iranians who emigrated in America and who had to start a new life in a new culture. For me as first generation American of Iranian parents, I was most touched by the woman who got emotional talking about how her children would never see or experience the Iran that she grew up in. In fact, that Iran does not exist anymore. I think my parents and many Iranians could really relate to that.  My other favorite part? The comedian Maz Jobrani, who is hilarious as always -- love him!",1357603200,4,609,4.587155963302752
8551625,5,B00AHHTTRG,"The Iranian Americans is fantastic!  So often I am asked about my heritage and culture and other than my own personal stories and pictures, I don't have much to share. This documentary covers diverse perspectives and is something I intend to share with friends and colleagues.  Andrew Goldberg has done an outstanding job.",1356480000,2,322,5.056603773584905
8551626,1,B00AHHTTRG,"This film is not much different from Shahs of Sunset, because it portrays a very small percentage of Iranian Americans, hoping to portray all Iranian Americans a certain way. I, in no way, relate to this film, nor does it represent most Iranian Americans I know. This luxurious image of successful immigrants whose families are so close and warm is not the reality of most Iranian immigrants. We get divorced, go bankrupt, never get an education, committ crimes, beat our wives, sleep around, and work hard just to feed ourselves. I am a graduate student making $13,000 a year. I moved to this country at 16. The younger children in my family seldom attend our gatherings. Most second generation Iranians can't speak a word of Farsi. Many Iranian immigrants drive taxi cabs, clean houses, sell shoes, or lay tiles. The only difference between this film and the Shahs of Sunset is that it focuses on an opposite cultural extreme it tries to establish as the Iranian American collective identity. It's pathetic that we are so pretentious and ashamed of those of use who don't fit our rich and educated ideal.",1356393600,3,1106,4.826315789473684
8551627,5,B00AHHTTRG,"I loved this movie. Finally,there is a fair documentary that shows Iranian like other people like to live a happy life, get together, eat, laugh and have fun. They work hard and they are educated.",1356220800,3,196,4.628571428571429
8551628,5,B00AHHTTRG,"My husband and I were very happy to see The Iranian-Americans. I am a Persian Baha'i and my husband is an American Baha'i. We meet in Iran at the beginning of the Revolution and we haven't been back since. Nor will we ever go back until things change for the better. Baha'is have suffered most grievously under the bloody-hands of the religious fanatics.

The interviews were touching and some of them made me miss my homeland but I was not happy with the focus on rich refugees. There are so many hard working, wonderful, talented Iranians living in the U.S. and they all mourn for Iran.

Next, we would like to see a realistic portrayal of Iranian political and religious refugees who have immigrated here and have worked so hard to succeed.

The documentary did a wonderful job balancing the old ways with the new. In the next documentary,if we are lucky enough to have one, show how the first generation Persian-American children are growing up, testing the new ways of living in America. Some find it satisfying but others have been exploring their roots and finding much new meaning in integrating the old and the new.

Thank you.",1356220800,3,1136,4.693467336683417
