8363042,1,B002C39T32,"Okay, here I was looking forward to this show that I had seen on TV but I thought it would be better without commercials(I hate them).  I was so happy to find out Amazon had it, I stopped watching the episode I was on and turned the TV off.  The package arrived pretty quick and in great condition but when I put it in the player it was a CARTOON!!!  Something about Sherlock Hound. Both discs were the same thing! The case was right, the disc graphics were right but it was a stupid cartoon that was burned on it.  Alright, calm down, I told myself mistakes happen so I requested a replacement (painless, really).  Well, when it arrived guess what... the same thing! WTF?  So now I can no longer do a replacement but I can do a refund (on a replacement) which is for the sum total of $0.00. GREAT! Maybe the guy who burned these should have waited until after work to sneak a toke.  Give me a good reason to order another.",1448582400,,923,4.2102272727272725

8363044,5,B002C39T32,"I bought ""Doing Da Vinci"" after watching the episode on the tank, and I did so with a purpose in mind. I think it is lamentable that the school age population has so little exposure to adults engaged in their careers. My teenage son, for example, thinks he would like to become a mechanical engineer. I bought ""Doing Da Vinci"" for the primary purpose of giving him a glimpse of what he might be in for, albeit in a very general and probably over-entertaining way.

As an engineer myself, I can attest to the fact that the show touches on it all: problem definition, design, materials, manufacturability, testing, and the all-important facets of communication, conflict resolution and teamwork.

Entertaining, yes indeed. But moreover, it is good to see him fired up about something other than baseball and girls. I recommend that every guidance counselor in the country collect a library of DVDs like ""Doing Da Vinci"" so the up and coming generation can look at them and perchance get a little excited about the prospect of getting up in the morning and going to work.",1383868800,2,1068,4.767567567567568
8363045,5,B002C39T32,This DVD shows some of Leonardo's untried ideas being rebuilt by a small group of skilled craftsmen and designers. And one complete idiot. If you enjoy history and seeing people put a lot of effort into something aided by someone who thinks accurate measurements happen to other people then this is a must see.,1382400000,2,310,4.7592592592592595
8363046,3,B002C39T32,"It's a fun Discovery Channel show, but don't expect Mythbusters. This is first and foremost presented as Reality TV. The focus of the show isn't on the cool contraption the guys are building - it's about the people themselves and how they interact while building each machine. Do not go into this show expecting a documentary or something like Mythbusters - you'll be disappointed. With that said, this isn't a bad show. If you like Da Vinci (or just medieval machinery) and don't loath reality TV, you'll enjoy this short-lived TV series.",1352505600,,539,4.869565217391305
8363047,4,B002C39T32,"The 2 DVD set ""Doing Da Vinci"" contains six episodes.  In each episode, builders attempt to create a machine that is based on the drawings and notes of Leonardo Da Vinci.  The advertising claim that they work ""using only materials available in da Vinci's own time"" is false.  In fact, they use plywood, steel beams and the nuts and bolts that you find in modern hardware stores.  They use modern saws, drills, mills, and welders.  (I am not disturbed by this.  Da Vinci's era did have steel and wood. Making steel beams and plywood would have been possible, although laborious. The episodes are certainly not valid tests of the economic feasibility of Da Vinci's concepts.)  The sheer size of some machines is impressive.  Many of their beams and posts are larger than the typical handyman would encounter.  When a project is completed, it is given some undemanding tests.  For example, the mobility of the ""armored tank"" is only tested by a few runs on a flat cleared lot.  The focus of the episodes is upon interpersonal dynamics in the group of builders.  (Fans of the TV show ""American Chopper"", will be familiar with the concept.  These episodes are a toned-down, PG-rated version of that idea.)  The rough and ready attitude of the woodworkers is often in conflict with the precise habits of the group building the metal parts.

I rate ""Doing Da Vinci"" as four stars out of five to indicate that it is a reasonably entertaining documentary of some modern woodworking and metalworking, as well as some workshop conflicts.  It doesn't rate five stars on any of those aspects alone.  It isn't a convincing demonstration that Leonardo's inventions were practical, but it does show that they work ""in principle"".  After all, each project is merely the first prototype of a machine.

Contents And Synopsis

Disk 1
Armored Tank
A circular tent shaped tank with 30 black powder cannon shooting 2 lb balls.  The movement of the tank is tested on a flat lot.  (The movement of war machines in other episodes is tested on the same lot.)  It shoots some plywood soldier silhouettes.

Siege Ladder
A rolling siege machine about 20 ft tall designed to drop a covered ramp across a 30 ft moat

Scythe Chariot
A chariot with rotating scythe like blades.  The pair of horses is replaced by a robot cart, in the interests of safety.  The blades are actually sharp and dangerous.  The chariot is tested against watermelons, bags of flour, plywood soldier silhouettes and a dummy.

Disk 2
Machine Gun
Not actually a machine gun, but a weapon with 3 sections of 11 cannons per section, firing 6 lb balls.  After one section of cannons is fired, a new section is rotated into firing position.  The machine is tested against plywood soldier silhouettes

Self Propelled Carts
Two spring powered carts are built by rival teams.  They have a race.

Catapult
A catapult with a hurling arm that is powered by a large bow.  It is tested, mainly in a humorous manner,  and doesn't have an impressive range.",1281312000,3,2982,4.755859375
