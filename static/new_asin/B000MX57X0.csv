Treat Williams plays one of the sons in a family of crooks.  He and his brother find out his father had made a big score, which ended up getting his father shot to death, and both try to find the stashed loot before the other brother, as well as all sorts of other hoodlums, find it.

It's extremely well done, Treat Williams, Seymour Cassel and Paul Shulze play the parts perfectly and the rest of the cast are very recognizable and do a great job.  Good movies are only great when the actors all do their jobs well and every single actor for every bit part, does a great job with their character.  It's one of those movies that, after you finish watching the thing, you say ""Wow, that was a good movie.  How come I never heard of it?""

It's well worth having this in your collection...if you can find the DVD, of course.",1213574400,2,987,4.274193548387097
