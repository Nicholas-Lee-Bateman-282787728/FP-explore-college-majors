7918963,3,B00003ETQD,"Specifically regarding Horrors From Space Collection from Triton Multimedia. Teenagers From Outer Space and Phantom From Space are substandard compared to other releases by other low-price distributors such as Treeline/Mill Creek. Killers From Space is better than same from Mill Creek's Sci Fi Classics Collection.

All three are black-and-white, low-budget B-movies. They are slightly entertaining if you like low-budget sci-fi films but are not bad enough to be in the league with Plan 9 From Outer Space and certainly not as entertaining as the Universal Studios sci fi serials from the 1930s/40s such as Flash Gordon, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, Flash Gordon Trip to Mars, and Buck Rogers.

Considering the Triton collection is is being sold for $0.65 plus shipping, it is a relative bargain. Personally, I would spend another dollar or two and buy better copies or something more entertaining. But, that is your decision.",1218585600,,935,5.35374149659864
7918964,5,B00003ETQD,"The transfer on this DVD could be better, but for the price I couldn't complain. My favorite movie on this dvd is ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" The acting is horrible and the dialogue simply ridiculous. Cheesy sci fi fans will love this film for the corny special effects, the ""Gargon"" as they are called is a giant lobster and very poorly done, but it's a hoot, guaranteed to make you laugh.
""Phantom from Space"" is actually a pretty good movie, the special effects are not bad for it's time, and the movie will hold your interest, it's an okay storyline. I really enjoyed it and if you are a die hard 50's sci fi fan this is a must have!!
""Killers from Space"" has got to be among one of the lowest budget movies ever made. The space men are just great! Men dressed in a one piece hooded suit with ping pong balls cut in half for their eyes. Wow! scary! Plus you get to see them in the ""special"" green effect! I liked this movie because I like REALLY bad cheesy sci fi.
This dvd also includes 2 bonus features, a Popeye cartoon and a Ray Milland radio broadcast ""Night Cry"".",1027296000,12,1074,4.295566502463054
7918965,5,B00003ETQD,"Phantom From Space is a decent movie for genre fans, sort of an ""Invisible Man From Planet X"" amalgamation, cheap but intriguing. Killers From Space is not very good at all, managing to be at once ridiculous and rather dull. Both of these are directed by W. Lee Wilder (Billy Wilder's less-successful brother).
On to Teenagers From Outer Space... Sometimes called one of the worst movies ever made, it has received that moniker unfairly. Sure, it is laughable in spots-an alien named Derek, a giant monster which is naught but a lobster shadow, truly wooden performances, and sometimes-hideous dialogue- but be honest as you watch this. You've seen much worse.
This movie is just plain entertaining. The pace is lightning-quick; that alone separates it from a myriad of similar 50's sci-fi efforts. It is better-directed than many films of its ilk, and the story has definite thought behind it, meager as its execution may be. The plot may seem redundant at times, but that was to me in keeping with the suspense of serials from the 30's and 40's. The FX are not that much worse than, say, the CGI on Babylon 5's early episodes, and the story is no more stupid than anything from the Bay/Bruckheimer team. And you know the movie means business when the first thing the aliens do upon landing is skeletonize a dog. Now that's evil!
It is a very earnest movie with a message that, while self-conscious and a tad overinflated, is unduly lampooned in these cynical times. There is camp (valiant misfires, entertaining and good-spirited) and there is dreck (exploitative crap by people who know they are making crap and wouldn't have it any other way). Give me camp any day.
Teenagers From Outer Space is not a good movie, but it is a very fun movie, one to watch again and again. I enjoyed it, and to say so does not make me feel ashamed ...much.
P.S. The transfer is pretty good; not as good as the Wade Williams collection from Image, but definitely worth the price.",991353600,10,1964,4.695652173913044
