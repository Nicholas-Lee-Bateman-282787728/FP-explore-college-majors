The plot is more involved than I remember. I got this for nostalgia. I grew up with Grupo Garibaldi. I could have used more music in the movie.

The digital rendering is terrible. The did not bother cleaning up the picture at all when the put this on disc. The audio is pretty good given how bad the picture quality is. A shame given the beautiful visuals of being by the sea.",1421971200,,523,4.117647058823529
