6576921,2,B00MFVHLT0,"Every time I purchase something I don't like, I  become annoyed.  Within the first few moments of this story I was annoyed.  I guess I am just  hard-boiled crime procedural fan and like plausible stores with plausible people, and this was really stretching it.  I am not amused by attempts at political correctness for the sake of humor and finding human eccentricities of people fodder for humor.  If anything I find this series insulting. I read all of the comments before I purchased this and took everything to heart but this one is really so far from what I read. The thing I dislike oat is the acting.  The director really reined in the actors, and the cutesy music was more than I could bear.  If you are not serious about your detectives, then this is for you. You could slip these adventures in with ""Moving On"" and no one would know the difference.  The first story is weak and I have become so bored with stories about school children conjuring up serial murders I could gag.  When are there going to be some good stories again? Stories about emotionally underdeveloped and psychotic male detectives and unwed female detectives with clever children who shag anything on wheels seem to be the thing lately.  If this is the way it is we are all doomed. This",1447027200,6,1266,4.582222222222223
6576922,5,B00MFVHLT0,"CHASING SHADOWS.  This British television series by ITV is akin to detective dramas with currently fashionable flawed detectives, brilliant at their work but socially inept heroes like Bones, Monk and Sherlock. In this current day, London-set police procedural, DS Sean Stone (Reece Shearsmith, THE WIDOWER, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN) possesses an uncanny knack for seeing patterns where others dont, getting inside the minds of serial killers. His ability makes him a brilliant detective, but hes hindered by a personality disorder that rubs colleagues the wrong way. Following a workplace blunder-- Stone embarrasses his chief at the Metropolitan police force, (the Met), at a news  conference. A conference meant to celebrate the MetsStones  successful solving of a case.  The detective  is demoted from the homicide division to the Missing Persons Bureau, seconded for life, where hes forced to team up with his polar opposite: warm, empathetic analyst Ruth Hattersley (Alex Kingston, ER, DOCTOR WHO,UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS).  This four-part British mystery series, which I received as a review copy, also stars Noel Clarke (STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, DOCTOR WHO) as DI Carl Prior, Stones police counterpart.  It comes as a two disc set containing four episodes, running approximately 183 minutes. With subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not up-to-date with London slang.

The intense, socially awkward Stone and Hattersley, mismatched partners, clash from the start. Nevertheless, Stone dives headfirst into the bureaus massive database  as many as 300,000 people go missing in the United Kingdom every year -- to spot signs of serial killers behind some cases. Did the lonely teenage girl who posted on a suicide message board kill herself? Why did a lawyer and devoted family man disappear? To find the missing,  and protect societys most vulnerable from the evil that may stalk them, Stone will have to reckon with his own personality flaws before they destroy his career; harness Hattersleys talents. Also starring Don Warrington as the chief, the very same role he plays in MURDER IN PARADISE; Alfie Field (THE WOMAN IN BLACK).  Guest starring the mega talented Susan Lynch, a North Ireland-born actress who seems to have worked without stop since her debut in THE COMMITMENTS, going on to such as CRACKER, WAKING NED DEVINE, ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE. This dark, sophisticated crime drama features smart scripts, strong performances.  And has no onscreen sex, profanity, or violence. The episodes are:
1. Only Connect, Part 1. After publicly criticizing police procedure upon the eventual capture of a serial killer, DS Sean Stone, who seems never to take off his raincoat, is sent to the Missing Persons Bureau. There he begins to track Leanne, possible multiple murderer  the usage Stone prefers -- of vulnerable teenagers.
2. Only Connect, Pt. 2. In trying to track Leanne, Sean and Prior arrive at an eerie disused shopping mall, to find Ruth, whod gone to meet Leanne, with a bad head wound. Prior's concerned  about Ruth's injury; Sean's more concerned about whether she got a clear look at Leanne.
3. Off Radar, Pt. 1. Sean, sorting through the deluge of missing persons cases coming into the office, singles out one that doesn't seem to fit the normal categories. And if there's one thing Sean finds more interesting than someone who fits a pattern, it's someone who doesnt.
4. Off Radar, Pt. 2.  A convicted multiple murderer who is being kept in a secure mental hospital dies: police brass want to bury the whole affair and move on. But Sean's not so sure.  This episode ends on a cliffhanger; in this house we  sure hope  therell be a second series.

CHASING SHADOWS is well-written, with tight scripts, good dialogue, appropriate chat in the cop shops. Uniformly good acting.  Its well photographed.  And it gives us the highs and lows of its world: striking views of London, an immensely impressive imperial city, also views of abandoned factories, malls: its gritty to the taste.  And witty. The entertainment is quietly funny, warm in its presentation of people who are concerned about each other. While still keeping the viewer glued to the edge of his/her seat.  Another binge-watcher in this house, we gobbled up its four episodes",1443830400,8,4258,5.148040638606676
6576923,5,B00MFVHLT0,"This 4 episode crime drama really drew me in. The DVD will not be available until October 20th but I was provided an advance copy for an objective review. This is something you will want to binge watch. Its just over 3 hours total (each episode in this miniseries is just over 45 minutes.) It was produced for the commercial ITV network in the UK.

The series centers on a missing persons unit (where there is often  but not always -0 a seriel killer). Whats unique here is the new DS, (detective supervisor_ Sean Stone. Hes a quirky loner but sometimes his mind works like a savant and  though he is a loner  he does solve crimes. Im not providing any spoilers here (not plot summaries for each episode, which I, personally find useless, but you know that in 90% (or more) of all mysteries the crime is solved. Its how they solve it that matters.
The DVD does include violence and nudity.
After the last episode ended I didn't want the series to end. I wanted another four or 6 more chapters. But, alas, none are there.
There are subtitles but I didn't need them as the British accents were not think (for me at least).

Surprisingly, there are no special features on the DVD version; just the four episodes.

HIGHLY recommended to those who like crime shows like Vera and Columbo

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6576924,5,B00MFVHLT0,"Two missing person/crime investigations are presented with the premier series of this new and unique crime show. Again, the UK shows its expertise in the copper drama series TV segment. It comes with some very good writing and acting. Each feature-length story is divided into two episodes. The primary cast remains the same through both. It is difficult to say if Reece Shearsmith or Alex Kingston is the lead in the series. Shearsmith, as DC Stone, fills the primary plot and basis for Chasing Shadows due to his peculiar and unlikable character. Stone made me as a viewer feel a bit caustic against him, the sign of both good acting and dialogue writing. Kingston, being a favorite actress of mine which I loved in Moll Flanders and Hope Springs, shines as Stones forced partner, Ruth, as they search for missing persons in dire hopes of finding and releasing them prior to their death.
Perhaps only 4 to 4.5 stars for this series compared to all of the other world leader cop shows in the UK; BUT certainly worthy of at least nearly 5 stars when compared to cop shows all over the world. CHASING SHADOWS certainly deserves viewers for being so daringly different.

Other cast worthy of note are Myriam Acharki as Adele, Stones housekeeper; Noel Clarke as DI Pryor; plus Susan Lynch and Nicholas Gleaves playing in Off Radar.
SDH SUBTITLES for all episodes.

Only Connect: Part 1
Tactless, a minus on the social skills scale, DS Stone's temperament in a police press conference gets him demoted to Missing Persons neglecting coordination while working with Ruth. A teen member of a suicide forum is the case under investigation. This debut story certainly plays with Stone's abrasive mental and psychological social make-up.
Only Connect: Part 2
Stone and Prior find Ruth half unconscious as a victim of suspect Leanne. Stone continues to get complaints from police for his quirky, rude behavioras he finds patterns and a killer.

Off Radar: Part 1
Ruth and Stones new missing person is solicitor Steve Eli. Stone may know the criminals ID at the start via patternsbut can he find proof
Off Radar: Part 2
Stone becomes convinced suspect Vance is innocent. He & Ruth start over to discover what the lawyer was keeping from his son. The episode ends with a tease to what the next case will be; and the desire for another series of Chasing Shadows is high for this viewer. Stones antisocial manner drives me up a wall (as the writers desire) but I strongly desire another series of missing person cases.",1443139200,19,2503,4.802784222737819
6576925,4,B00MFVHLT0,"ITV produced these four episodes in 2014; the final scene appears to begin yet another case but don't know if more series will follow.  Reece Shearsmith's Monk-ish lead character is more suited to Royston Vasey (League of Gentlemen) than to a police station.  These 2 two-part stories are  a cut above the bog standard US programme and certainly worth buying; but they don't quite match the excellence of other current fare (Shetland, Broadchurch, Vera, etc.)  There are subtitles and a 'play all' option.",1439164800,25,505,5.048192771084337

I turned on the first show and then compulsively watched all that were available and this is from someone who has watched IT ALL.

Stone played by Reece Shearsmith and Ruth Hattersley, played by Alex Kingston. D.S. Stone is a brilliant detective that can see how the pieces of the mystery fit together before the rest of the department which causes friction with his colleagues. He also has a very difficult time getting along with people. He only has one focus in his life and that is solving the crime. At times he appears to be disturbed. His assistance Ruth Hattersley  needs to have a more substantial role to help balance D.S. Stone's screen time.

Season 1 ends in a cliff hanger with characters (really characters) developed and one of them is missing.  Not that I need closure, but I want closure.  That's the deal with Chasing Shadows.  Autism spectrum, empath and well drawn writing.  It is taut.  It balances who dun it with post facto couldas.  Come on.  Give us season two.  I want to know if Reece Shearsmith puts together another airplane model.  Is he really a comedian?  His character is hardly laughable, but he is compelling.",1485820800,3,567,4.683673469387755

I hope they continue the series because it wasn't given a fair chance. I like a TV show that reveals it's characters slowly, as in the case here. Really enjoyed this series - MORE PLEASE!",1460246400,3,488,4.304347826086956
6576955,5,B00MFVHLT0,"The London Metropolitan Police's triumphant press conference announcing the arrest of a serial killer is DS Sean Stone's first time in front of the cameras. It may be his last, given that Stone deadpans, for the country to see and hear: ""If we had treated each woman as part of a pattern rather than separate missing-person cases, we would have found Alan Harvey [the killer] sooner and Carol Taft would still be alive. And we failed.""

Chief Constable Harley Drayton is not pleased. He calls Stone into his office and tells him, with understatement and  ill-concealed fury: ""The strategic outcome of this case is your permanent secondment to Missing Persons. Looking for serial killers.""

That's why the next day, Ruth Hattersly, Senior Analyst for the UK Missing Persons Bureau, comes to work to find Stone going through files in the office she'll now share with him. Until now, Ruth has been a desk jockey, commiserating with worried parents and spouses over the phone, recommending counselling, etc.

But Stone changes that. He looks for a pattern or a disappearance that breaks a pattern, and he considers it his job to investigate. He's supposed to refer any lead to D.I. Prior, but Stone can't see the logic in that.  It's funny to watch the flummoxed Hattersly chasing after Stone, going from scene to scene and interview to interview. Her job is all diplomacy and comfort, Stone is all buttoned-up and abruptness. They are a contrast, but, by the end of the series, they are working together.

Series 1 has two mysteries, each divided into two 46-minute episodes. That's about 90 minutes a mystery, which is a nice length of time for character development and plot intricacy. The first mystery, ""Only Connect"", involves teen suicide and a website which appears to promote it. In the second, ""Off Radar"", Stone finds a disappearance that doesn't fit the usual profile. He was a successful lawyer; no financial problems, no significant other problems. And no body. One day he just disappeared.

""Chasing Shadows"" originally aired in 2014. Its four episodes total 183 minutes. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo sound. English SDH subtitles are available. There are no bonus extras on the DVD.

I've been a fan of Alex Kingston since she starred as River Song in the ""Doctor Who"" sci-fi series. It's amusing to see her play the frumpish Ruth Hattersly, because as River Song she is exuberant.

Trivia: A ""misper"" is slang for a missing person. Makes it easier, doesn't it?

A recommended mystery series. I was sorry to find out it wasn't renewed. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.

The two main characters are very good and the writing and directing are intelligent.

The woman, 'Ruth', has a 14 or 15- year old son who is very bright and who is entranced with serial killers -- as a subject. His personality, loner and fount of knowledge, mirrors that of the demoted policeman Sean, the Asperger'sish co-worker of Ruth, a  long-time searcher of missing persons. I wish very much we could see more of her son who is a very attractive, smart boy. I expected him to join the team and to help Sean with his obsessive, detailed searches. But he only offered educated categories -- of killers and of missing persons --  which his mother proceeded to use and to pass on to Sean. There is another detective who assists in the hunts and is also good.

Sean has a beautiful, foreign housekeeper who helps teach him how to relate to people in more normal ways -- which he makes headway on during the episodes. She figures largely in Sean's life and has a young daughter; I wish we could see more of them in these episodes.

Unfortunately, this lands him in hot water and gets him reassigned to Missing Persons, the last department anyone gets sent to before getting sacked. But even there, his brilliance shines through.

8671974,5,B00MFVHLT0,"CHASING SHADOWS is a four-part mini series that should have become an all-out series (still hoping)! Both Alex Kingston (TV's THE KNOCK) and Reece Shearsmith (SEAN OF THE DEAD, THE COTTAGE) are superb as the socially inept, dysfunctionally brilliant DS Sean Stone and the Missing Persons Bureau's warm, far more approachable Ruth Hattersley, respectively. The supporting characters are equally well drawn. As w/ other British TV cop shows, the episodes play like theatrical releases, and lack the commercial cheeeziness of some American police ""dramas"". Astonishingly, the last installment ends w/ a cliff-hanger, begging for resolution! This was maddening! This show needs to be picked up as a series. Now! Still waiting...",1495324800,,724,5.531531531531532
8671975,3,B00MFVHLT0,I was a little disappointed in the DVD. It was ok but moved a little slow for my taste,1492560000,,86,3.5789473684210527
