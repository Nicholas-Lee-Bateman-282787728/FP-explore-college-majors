5340654,5,B009IPQ9XU,"My first concert hooked me with their feel good music. Then I couldn't get enough of the Madison Square Garden concert DVD. I have been waiting for this DVD for months. I can only watch so much youtube. I think the only thing that would be better would to be there. However, if I can't be there, I want the band in my living room! These guys are probably one of the hardest working bands around who truly play for the love of the music. So excited by this purchase! OAR rocks!",1353888000,,476,4.184782608695652
5340655,5,B009IPQ9XU,"O.A.R. Live on Red Rocks is one of the BEST shows I have ever seen!  This band has incredible energy and sound.  I was fortunate enough to see this show from the front row, and now that it is on CD and DVD I can relive it over and over!  So great to see how pumped up the crowd is from the front row to the back.  The bonus video on the DVD, Standing on a Hot Burning Sun, was also a great behind the scenes look into the lives of these guys!  This band truly cares about their music and their fans and you can see that in this DVD!
Thank you guys! I look forward to more of these!",1353888000,,581,3.768595041322314

5340661,5,B009IPQ9XU,Awesome!,1404172800,,8,8.0
5340662,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I loved watching this Blu-ray and didn't have an issue with the sound as I only have 2.1 with my sound bar.

There is a mini documentary and you can also move directly to specific songs from the menu.

Just as good as Live at MSG.",1392940800,,230,3.9782608695652173
5340663,5,B009IPQ9XU,"Great live show. Love the addition of the horn section. It really adds a lot to their sound, aside from just the sax.",1392681600,,117,4.130434782608695
5340664,5,B009IPQ9XU,"This was a gift to my son, a fanatical O.A.R. fan. He had the original DVD, but this Blu-ray version had some extras, particularly a documentary about OAR which he really enjoyed.",1389052800,,179,4.625
5340665,4,B009IPQ9XU,"Excellent sound & visual quality, the band is ON and horn section adds even more energy to songs. I might have tweeked the setlist a little, just to include some personal favourites. A definite must for O.A.R. fans",1387584000,,214,4.657894736842105
5340666,5,B009IPQ9XU,"The band is great live.  One of my favorite summer acts to see every year.  Their talent and awesome live show ability is captured in this blu-ray.  And for those not too familiar with the band lately - they have an expanded horns section (not just Jerry anymore)  that sound really in-sync together.  Plus, the band LOVES Red Rocks and they always put on a good show there.  If you are a longtime fan or someone just a little curious, buy this blu-ray!",1386028800,,453,4.397590361445783
5340667,5,B009IPQ9XU,This is a great DVD!!  Very enjoyable way to spend 2-1/2 hours.  Would highly recommend this even if you're not familiar with the band..you'll become a fan.,1381104000,,156,4.7407407407407405
5340668,5,B009IPQ9XU,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. I watched this when it was aired on Palladio, now I can watch it whenever I want. Great show, and great short video giving you a little window inside of the band while they travel. Can't wait for the new album.",1378339200,,237,4.409090909090909
5340669,5,B009IPQ9XU,This is without a doubt one of the best live performances you'll ever see and hear. If you already know O.A.R. then I need say no more.  If you've not seen this concert then be sure to get it on this Blu-ray.  The visuals and sound mixing and recording are near perfect!  Love that Sax!!!!!,1372032000,,290,4.236363636363636
5340670,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I made a point of being in front of my TV when this concert was broadcast live an AXSTV. I couldn't bring myself to delete it off of the TiVo either.

This show features a matured band playing a great set list. If you're a fan of O.A.R. you already own this. If you're not, this disc will convert you.",1371600000,,301,4.016666666666667
5340671,3,B009IPQ9XU,"I was shocked to receive this concert disc and find that despite being on a Blu Ray, it only has 2 channel sound! That is pathetic!",1367366400,3,131,4.076923076923077
5340672,5,B009IPQ9XU,"just buy it, watch & listen, it will be obvious. Repeat as necessary & you will see things you hadn't before.",1365379200,,109,4.238095238095238
5340673,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I waited to buy the Blu-ray version to get the full effect. The Video is spectacular, however the audio is only 2.1. No worries though.  I would definitely recommend this disc to any O.A.R. or DMB fan. It is awesome to see such a great band escalate to this quality. Can't wait to see you guys back in Austin.",1364342400,,309,4.237288135593221
5340674,4,B009IPQ9XU,"We were first exposed to OAR at the pre-Super Bowl beach party in Ft. Lauderdale, before the Saints beat the Colts. The music and live gig are perfect for the beach, and the show translates well to Red Rocks, one of the planet's great venues. This is a fun show to watch or to listen to. I didn't see an option to buy a DVD-CD set, which would have been nice, or a Blu Ray version.",1363651200,,381,4.026315789473684
5340675,5,B009IPQ9XU,Bought this for a present for my husband.  He has watched in many times already.  The DVD has many of our favorite songs on it.,1363478400,,127,4.04
5340676,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I love o.a.r., and this is probably my favorite DVD to date. The concert is amazing, and I really enjoyed the tour movie that was with it. Love it!",1360195200,,147,4.103448275862069
5340677,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I am a long time R&B fan. I mainly enjoy lively music whose lyrics have some meaning. That is why I'm also a fan of Dave Matthews. O.A.R. is right up there with DMB.

Of A Revolution has a sound that won't let you sit still and go to sleep. The lyrics are thoughtful and have a message for anyone who cares to listen to it. The music is awesome. These guys jam like there is no tomorrow. I can't think of anyone I'd rather see live, but since I don't get out very much, I'll be watching this DVD until it melts!",1359676800,,511,3.9611650485436893
5340678,5,B009IPQ9XU,Bought this for my son for Christmas. He was at the concert and had such a great time. Now he can relive the experience every time he watches it.,1358985600,,145,4.0344827586206895

8542064,5,B009IPQ9XU,"I saw OAR at the Peoria blues festival in 2016 - never had heard of them before.  WHAT A GREAT CONCERT.  I listen to their music on Amazon Prime, and added 3 of their albums to my collection.  This is my favorite.  It comes closest to the experience of hearing them live.",1487462400,,271,4.153846153846154
8542065,5,B009IPQ9XU,Wish I was there but this will have to do,1470873600,,41,3.2
8542066,5,B009IPQ9XU,"While I wasn't at the original concert, I did see the televised version of this.  Rather than eat up space on the DVR by keeping that recording, I opted to purchase the Blu-ray.  The concert still looks as good as ever, and the additional material gives a nice inside look at the band.  If you're not an O.A.R. fan, watching the video probably won't convert you (get the CDs instead!), but this is a great product for anyone who is a fan of the band.",1470009600,,450,4.270588235294118
8542067,5,B009IPQ9XU,"one of the best concert dvds i own, watch it all the time.",1453420800,,58,3.5384615384615383
