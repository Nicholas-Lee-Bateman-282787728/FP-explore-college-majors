2628857,4,B000H5V8DG,"I started watching second season after having seen only a few episodes from season 1, but I was immediately hooked, and I have been a die-hard fan ever since.  The characters had excellent chemistry, the writing has for the most part been great, the plots had so many twists and turns that you could hypothesize every potential outcome and you'd still be wrong.  The cliffhangers were completely compelling and addictive--you never wanted to stop watching, because you had to know what would happen next.  Even though the show struggled creatively throughout its last three seasons, the show overall was still good.  The cast was always excellent and well worth watching.  Victor Garber is amazing as Sydney's tough-as-nails yet loving father.  Ron Rifkin always keeps you guessing as Arvin Sloane, probably one of the most complex characters and most interesting villains on tv (maybe even in movies too) in recent years.  Lena Olin is absolutely spectacular as Irina Derevko as well.  The show was nearly always fun to watch, and there are very few episodes that are not up to par.  As many complaints as there were about the last three seasons, the show was still engaging and kept me wanting more.  This is a show not to be forgotten.",1154217600,3,1238,4.880382775119617
2628858,3,B000H5V8DG,"Alias is and was a great show. Period, end of story. And this box set looks amazing. However, I gave it three stars because this box set is in limited release and is making people who have loyally bought the dvd's of previous seasons rebuy them in order to get the special features not included anywhere else. Buema VIsta seems to be forgeting those of us who have watched and loved the show from the beginning and who have helped keep it alive (and bought the dvd's etc). It just feels like I (and many others) are getting the bird from the people producing this set.",1154217600,7,568,4.367924528301887
2628859,5,B000H5V8DG,"If you've never seen an episode of this amazing show you have no idea what your missing... from the can't-take-a-breath pilot, to the mezmorizing series finale `Alias' was always about the shock factor, and once it got it's claws into you there was no letting go.  Serving almost as the Generation X, female version of James Bond, `Alias' is a heartpounding spy-series that does not know how to give the audience a break.

 Throughout the Series 105 episodes we are given a glimpse into the life of Sydney Bristow and her unbelievable and crazy decade-long transition from a wide-eyed nave graduate student, to the worldly and weathered woman that she became, with all the bumb's and bruises along the way; and let's not forget all the butt-kicking that came along with that as well...

 With Seasons One and Two, starts off with a pilot that introduces us to the happy and excited Syndey Bristow, her relationship with her estranged father, her two best friends: Francie and Will, and her soon-to-be fianc; not to mention her job as an undercover spy for the CIA.  But it isn't long before Sydney realizes that she is not working for the CIA, but in fact for the very enemy she thought she was fighting, which leads her into a dangerous life as a double agent, fighting the war on both fronts.  While leading this life her personal life becomes very stressed, and she learns that sometime its impossible to separate the work from the personal.

 Season Three picks up approx 2 years after the season two finale, and to stay mostly spoiler-free all I will say is that her life has been turned upside down, and the season focus's on her quest for understanding her life.

 Season Four picks up about a year after season 3, and finds Sydney starting a new job, going back to being a Secret Agent, but with a few surprises on the work front.

 Season Five picks up again, about a year after season 4 and finds Sydney facing the realities of the world, and of her life...

 As you can see not much can be said without giving anything way.  This is an extremely complex/continuity heavy show that is really well known for being hard to follow (missing several minutes of an episode can affect your understanding of not only the next couple of episodes, but story lines several years down-the-lines) and this aspec's initially turned people off from the series in its broadcast run, in favor of the DVDs.

 Presented here are all 105 episodes, on 29 discs, with all the special features from the individual releases, as well as a special DVD with new bonus features and a commemorative book all packaged inside the Rambaldi artifact (a thing that play's a centeral role throughout the series).",1154217600,87,2687,4.680851063829787

The series is a dramatic story about a teenager recruited into what she believes to be a department of the CIA. She soon discovers that Arvin Sloane (Rifkin) is a bad guy, and all the different scenarios really challenge the border between possible and almost weird. But great fun to watch. Jennifer Garner really does a fine job, and all the players have truly brought about a good family setting of friendships even in the face of big challenges.",1420329600,,643,4.801801801801802

It's uncanny how Jennifer Garner looks good in every conceivable haircolor and bizarre outfit! Victor Garber is wonderful as the humorless Jack Bristow, while Lena Olin is mesmerizing as a Russian spy- (even though the constant slurring of her S's drove me nuts). I think the cutest character of all would have to be Marshall Flinkman, the bumbling and socially inept genius. His drum solo marriage proposal had my daughters and I rolling with laughter! ""Carrie....we had SUSHI"". The ""Rambaldi"" storyline gets a bit old, but the writers did a good job of weaving the story throughout the seasons.

  Sidney Bristow (Jennifer Garner-Affleck) is amazing playing this part. Sidney is an international spy recruited out of college and trained for espionage and self-defense. Sidney faces many trials and tribulations.  I am hooked.  So everyone needs to get this box set or watch on prime instant video.

2628891,5,B000H5V8DG,"I miss this show.  Excellent writing. Got of track near end of last season, as they always do.  Great acting.",1357257600,,109,4.4
2628892,4,B000H5V8DG,"Alias was a great concept that got a little weird when it started to focus on the Rambaldi storyline.  The first few seasons where that was merely in the background were great.  Jennifer Garner's character believed that she was working for the CIA (which she could not reveal to anyone) finds out after her fiancee was killed by the organization she was really working for what she was really involved in.  From there the show focuses on her life as a double agent and her attempts to bring down the rouge spy agency/criminal organization.

Where Alias really shined was character development and casting those parts.  Every character that was around for a significant amount of time changed from the time they were first introduced.  And of course Alias was a world where being dead did not always mean staying dead.  I think the best storyline of the series was the time jump, and the way it was done.  Sydney having lost two years with no memory, then finding out exactly how and why her memory was erased was a great payoff.  Especially when that is the kind of a story that often falls flat at the big reveal.

The one drawback to the series as I said before is by the end the entire focus was on the Rambaldi storyline, and making the whole supernatural/eternal life storyline.  It really did change the feel of the show, and while it did provide a good explanation for Sloane's motivation from the beginning, I think it did better when those parts of the storyline were in a few episodes of the season as opposed to the focus of the season.  Overall though if you are looking for a show that combined action, comedy, great acting and a unique take on the spy world (plus the bonus of Jennifer Garner in skimpy outfits on a pretty consistent basis) this is a good one.",1356393600,,1774,4.5266457680250785

Sidney showcases a wide range of emotional issues & how, as a rare pure-hearted soul, she struggles to cope with & press ahead of the obstacles thrown in her path.

The five-season series was at its best in the first year where Sidney discovers she's not in the CIA as she thought but rather in a rogue mafia-like organization. She subsequently becomes a double agent for the real CIA &, as you can imagine, the real fun begins.",1319932800,2,597,4.579439252336448

I'm probably going to send all the discs back, since they all have scratches on them... some might play, but there is no reasonable way I can test 5 seasons of dvds within a proper return period.

Just realized I never edited this review with my final comments. I did send back the entire 5 seasons of discs to BVHE, since I couldn't reasonably test them within the return period.

All of my discs look brand new, without any glue or scuff marks on them.  I'm not sure if there's any way to tell from outside the box if it's a newer or older pressing, but it does look like Buena Vista finally addressed the situation.

Though the plots are intriguing and tied together throughout 6 seasons in amazing ingenuity, if you're questioning this on the basis of whether or not it is a good movie suitable to watch with family values, it is definitely not.

There is nothing explicit in it (no nudity or extreme profanity, etc), and the violence is relatively managed and not gory.  But fidelity has no place in the TV series, and truth is greatly maligned as this series brings sympathy to the darkness of deceit.

After speaking with retailers in New Zealand this is a known fault and problem with this set and most DVD retailers are chosing not to stock this time.  What makes it even more challenging for International Customers is the extremely poor returns policy held by Amazon.  I have a glorified door stop in my lounge due to the hassles I have been having.

My only warning is that the individual cases have a tendency to scratch the DVDs, at least in my experience. But you almost feel like you are holding a replica of a Rambaldi design.",1228089600,,469,4.0978260869565215

2628923,5,B000H5V8DG,"Just out of college, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is recruited by Arvin Sloan (Ron Rifkin) to be part of a globe-trotting secret government spy agency known as SD-6. When tragic events occur Sydney realizes that SD-6 is not what it seems and joins up with her father (Victor Garber) at the CIA as a double agent to bring Sloan down with the help of her undercover handler and future lover Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and her partner Dixon (Carl Lumbly). Meanwhile, Sloan races to uncover the artifacts of an ancient profit known as Rambaldi, the possessor of all of them will become so powerful that they could become immortal and rule the world.

ABC was unusually good to ""Alias"". While they gave the show an opportunity to bring its 5-year story toward a satisfying conclusion, the show went through so many changes in the meantime it is hard to talk about it as one entity. Creator J.J. Abrams starts out keeping things very simple. Season 1 is like a run-and-gun video game where in episode after episode Sydney sneaks into a secret facility in a fantastic disguise, steals or downloads something for the CIA under the cover of SD-6 and then runs, kicks and punches her way out. Part ""La Femme Nikkita"", part ""Mission: Impossible"", it is a light and sound show.

In a rare example of positive network and creative collaboration Abrams got a call to reinvent the fledgling series (5th place will make a network start to get religion). What came out of the meeting was a complete dismantling of the series as we knew it and the establishment of something better. The show ditched the head-scratching cliffhanger endings for more self-contained episodes, but Abrams was given the freedom to continue his story arcs and flesh out the character relationships into what will ultimately be a tangled web of familial soap opera drama involving Syd's mother (Lena Olina) and Sloan's daughter.

Mid-way though the 2nd season and into the 3rd , ""Alias"" hits its stride. In a series filled with stupendous action sequences, a 2-hour finale that culminates in a rollicking, all-out brawl between Sydney and an evil duplicate of her roommate (just watch) that rips their apartment to splintered shreds ranks as one of the coolest scenes in modern TV for me. It is also here when the look of the show is expanded to a gorgeous cinematic scope it will have to the end. I could just drink up the colors and cinematography of this show. In addition to a perfectly short and sweet intro, Micahel Giacchino's on-target original score is laced with sound-alike Bernard Hermann violin riffs that beautifully puts a classic Hitchcock spy thriller spin on things.

Abrams has wrapped his core cast so tight with indispensable characters - including a show-stealing Kevin Weisman as computer ace Marshall (a 4th season bit where Marshall goes in the field, and must pass a retinal scanner, is classic) - that he has little room for twists and suspense. Unlike 2001's ""24"", we know that all of the ""Alias"" characters must stay safe to keep the story moving. He compensates by bringing in one long lost family member after another. Mothers, sisters, aunts and stepfathers all are revealed to be a close part of Sydney's universe. Some will find it a convoluted overkill, others will find it giving everyone more depth and resonance.

At the center of it all is Garner, who gamely goes for all the network's guilty pleasure requirements to put her in skimpy bikinis and lingerie. Strikingly beautiful, she has two modes as an actress (fighting and crying), but fills the heels of our kick-butt heroine perfectly - commanding the show and the audience around her just as a great hero should. Garber is an ever-present force of dignity and credibility. The show's fuel is arguably Rifkin who makes such a classically nasty villain and yet give him a vulnerability that, despite his pension for murder, makes you want to believe him.

Now, here's the problem with ""Alias"" and Abrams' writing style. Abrams spends a lot of time, for lack of a better word, stalling. Several episodes go by with nothing being revealed and wrenches being thrown into the gears of the story for no other purpose than to artificially drag out the over-arching plot until the end of the season, end of the series or maybe even until Abrams can finally settle on an endgame. Like many of the HBO serials, there is a lot of pointless running in place here.

Delivering a kick-butt girl-power action hero, a few David E. Kelley music-over-dialog montages and a focus on fashion and exotic locations mixed with some fierce violence, smashing guy-movie car chases and creativity in the gadgets and story lines that most women won't appreciate, ""Alias"" may have suffered a bit of gender confusion with the viewing public. I'm not sure if Abrams set out to create the ultimate gay man's spy series, but here it is. The big difference between ""Alias"" and the other spy shows is the endless imagination Abrams and his crew infuse it with. Tiny details like the inventive array of gadgets and weapons (like DNA replicating masks and microwave bombs) keep us enthralled.

Sure there are quite a few cracks in cinematically polished armor, but ""Alias"" is an overall solid, action-packed, visually vibrant piece of popcorn entertainment. Recommended for those that want something a little different and are willing to indulge its contrivances and trust that it actually might be going somewhere. The modern spy series given a little twist - Abrams gives it a refreshing imagination, Garner gives it strength, Garber credibility, and Rifkin a force to be reckoned with.",1223683200,42,5606,4.887486855941114

2628925,5,B000H5V8DG,"Warning!  Spoilers are littered throughout this review!

First, am I reviewing the series or the product?  My five-star review is for the series, not the product.  I watched ALIAS on TV when it first came out and having wanted to see various bits over the past two years, I decided I would buy the whole thing on DVD.  I was very tempted by the complete set (with the Rambaldi artifact box), but after getting a good look at it I realized it would not mesh well with other DVD box sets that I owned, so I decided that I would pay a bit more money and get each season individually.  I'm glad that I did.  I was able to get three seasons used off Amazon and bought the other two seasons new.

I became interested in rewatching ALIAS for two reasons.  First, I watched earlier this summer FELICITY for the first time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the show and realized that many of the actors on FELICITY would later appear on ALIAS, like the romantically paired (on FELICITY) Greg Gunberg and Amanda Foreman (interestingly, the guy who played the hipster friend of Amanda Foreman's FELICITY character was Kevin Weis, with whom she was romantically linked on ALIAS as Marshall Flinkman's wife).  Besides, I once heard an interview with J. J. Abrams in which he said he came up with the idea of ALIAS by thinking, ""Felicity Porter in the CIA.""  The second major reason I wanted to rewatch the show was the impending (actually, only two days from now) debut of J. J. Abrams fourth major TV series (yes, he's been involved with others, but FELICITY, ALIAS, LOST, and THE FRINGE have gotten the big push others have not) THE FRINGE.  After DOLLHOUSE (Joss Whedon's new series, due out this winter), this is the show I'm most anticipating this year, along with Alan Ball's new series TRUE BLOOD (and if Ron Moore's two series CAPRICA and/or VIRTUALITY make it to production by the end of the 2008-2009 season, those two as well).

When I was first watching ALIAS, my impression was that Seasons One and Two were the best, with a very slight dip in quality in Season Three, a sharper drop in Season Four, and further drop in early Season Five before getting very good again at the end.  This largely corresponds with my reviewing.  Season Three was a bit better than I remembered and Season Five even more enjoyable at the end than I recalled.  Season Four still disappoints, however.

There are so many great things about this show.  There are also a couple of things you simply have to learn to ignore, things that fall into the ""Willing suspension of disbelief"" category.  For instance, the world is a very, very big place.  But if anyone on the show needs to get to any spot on the globe, it doesn't seem to take more than a few hours.  But short of an SR-71 (or presumably the super secret Aurora spy plane) this simply isn't possible.  Plus, all the airplanes shown as transport o the show are subsonic.  Nonetheless, international logistics never seems to be a problem for Sydney and Company.  Still, the show as a whole is so much fun and so compelling, that as a viewer I have no trouble cutting them slack on this, unlike, say, PRISON BREAK, where you have to cut them slack on a few dozen things every episode (in my opinion, you can't call for a suspension of disbelief on everything that happens on a show).

Though we are introduced to a large number of characters over the seasons, the core cast is Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), initially working for what she takes to be a black ops section of the CIA, SD6, but in reality part of an international criminal organization known as the Alliance.  Though allegiances change over the years, on the side of the angels with Sydney are Michael Vaughan (Michael Vartan) of the CIA, her father Jack Bristow (the brilliant Victor Garber), her field partner Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbley), and technical genius Marshall Flinkman.  On the side of the devils are Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and recurring characters Irina Derevko (played by the beautiful and talented Lena Olin) and Julian Sark (David Anders).  The thread that runs through the show are the artifacts of an unknown Renaissance genius named Milo Rambaldi, someone so brilliant that he makes DaVinci look slow witted.  Arvin Sloane's driving obsession with Rambaldi along with Sydney's prophesied role in the culmination of Rambaldi's work remain unifying elements in each season of the series.  One didn't have to be a Rambaldi to realize that the series, if allowed to end on its own terms (and while it was cancelled earlier than many of us would have liked, they were allowed to wrap up the series as they wished), that it would only end when the mysteries of Rambaldi and Sydney's role in them were resolved.

Along the way through the five seasons ALIAS helped establish TV as a medium in which movie stars were free to appear as guest stars.  Few if any shows have had more remarkable guest stars than ALIAS.  Faye Dunaway, Christian Slater, Isabella Rosselini, the aforementioned Lena Olin, Sonia Braga (the last three playing the Derevki sisters), Quentin Tarantino, David Cronenberg, Amy Irving, Joel Grey, Ethan Hawke, Peter Berg, Lindsay Crouse, Roger Moore, Rutger Hauer, and Djimon Hounsou, not to ignore series regular Victor Garber, were some of the actors better known for their work on stage and screen than TV, though the series also had some great TV veterans like Terry O'Quinn (before becoming famous as Locke on LOST) and Ricky Gervais.  The casting from beginning to end was simply impeccable on the show.

One of the most important aspects of the show was its role in promoting female heroes on TV.  My own reading of TV over that time is that Buffy had made TV irreparably safe for heroic female characters.  Xena and Dana Scully had anticipated what was about to happen with empowered females on TV, but without Buffy they would perhaps have been remembered as exceptions.  Buffy was the character that changed all the roles.  Xena was too much of a cartoon to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.  But after Buffy it has been a commonplace.  But there had to be actual instances of heroic females as evidence that the rules had changed.  Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max on DARK ANGEL, and Sydney Bristow were the first -- and along with Veronica Mars and Starbuck from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still the best.  When someone writes the history of heroic women on TV, there will be a pre-Buffy section mentioning characters like the 1950s Annie Oakley, Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, Dana Scully, and Xena, then a section on Buffy, and finally the next wave.  Sydney Bristow should and will get her own chapter.  And what a great job Jennifer Garner did!  Though not trained in martial arts, she used her considerable athleticism (and early dance training -- indeed, dance seems to be a wonderful training ground for cinematic martial artists, further proof being the absolutely astonishing fight scenes by Summer Glau in SERENITY, showing that for a prima ballerina it is just choreography) to bring Sydney Bristow to life more believable than any other female hero.  In fact, to this day I've seen no TV female hero (and yes, I'm avoiding the word ""heroine"" intentionally -- ""heroines"" traditionally are anything but heroic) more physically convincing than Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow.  On top of this she brought acting chops that should have earned her a string of Emmys.  At least she got some nominations, unlike Lauren Graham, who astonishingly never got a single nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy when she should have won seven straight times.

I strongly recommend anyone interested in quality TV getting acquainted with ALIAS.  Few shows have had higher production values or better casts.  And while the overall story flagged a bit in Season Four and early in Season Five, the show took risks and kept striving to tell well an ambitious story.  It is bound to remain one of the touchstones of great television.",1220745600,2,7994,4.750181028240405

Jennifer Garner is amazing in her role as Sydney Bristow, a CIA agent. Along with her father, Jack Bristow, played by Victor Garber, another CIA agent. In addition to the Bristow's there is a cast of excellent characters including Sydney's love interest, Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and the arch nemesis though sometimes not Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin).

As for this box set it has everything you could ever want out of Alias.

I'm from Russia.
First we were shown 1-st season and I don't remember when it was exactly. Year ago probably we saw jast 2-nd season. On my last birthday my wife presented me pirate copies of all season. As a fact many episodos were missed. For this birthday I bought Rambaldy box and 5 seasons from Amazon. For the weekend I've seen almoust 4-th Episode and all night I was fighting with Sloan in my dreams. :)

If you asked - Are you a fan of Alias?
My answer is - yes.

First of All - it's interesting what will be after. Music is also wonderful. It's very dinamical and if needs dramatic. It's very interesting to watch under relations between Sid and Von. They are beautiful couple.

What I don't like:
Some scenes are to simple and not realistic
If somthing happens in German it means that all guys must drink bear and weitress must be dressed in meditiranian clothes. If it is Russia - vodka moscow and Siberia. :)

After reading the other reviews and seeing all the horror stories about discs being scratched and unplayable, I checked every disc immediately after the product arrived.  Most of the discs were in good shape, but some had minor scratches.  Nothing too bad, but the design is just stupid.

All the extras make this collection a must have for Alias fans.  The Rambaldi box is a great was to store them and there is a great little booklet that answers a lot of questions that viewers had; like was that really Sydney on page 47?  There is a hidden compartment in the bottom of the box with  another special DVD.  My only complaint about Alias was it only ran for five years; but at least it was the best five years of television.,1192579200,,573,4.126126126126126

dvd player, i decided to go with the USA version, because of the reviews that it was much better than the UK one, and also the price difference.

The box set took 3 weeks to arrive, which was not a problem as I ordered it in plenty of time for my husbands birthday.  Even with the 22 import duties the set came in at under 100, which was a bargain.

I openned the box and carefully checked every disk to make sure they they were not scratched.  I must say that the disks were very dirty, and some were scratched, but seemed to play ok.

The box itself is very lovely, with a plush plum velvetlining and the hidden compartment and with the added disk and book at made a great present.

It has an essential designing defect. for example there is not even one simple DVD in this box that you can find defectless. all of them are scratched because of wrong desiging of Disc holders, Some have been caused scratches during the packaging line, some in transportation and some at the first time you pull each of them out!. worse is, there are finger prints on many of discs. Box is very good looking inside out, maybe unique but when you want to pull out a disc and play it and when you see the scratches all over not most, ALL OF THEM, you feel you want to throw it out in trashcan! Yes it comes in shrink wrapp but in Amazon terms, it's status is ""ACCEPTABLE"" not ""NEW"". if they sell it at the price of 30 to 40 dollars it may worth it but in this price buying it just like you roll you money and light is as a cigar!",1188432000,15,879,4.086705202312139

I bought the Artifact box after watching the first seven episodes of the series and knew that I was going to want to watch the entire story unfold. Many people smash the show for the lack of a ""superstar"" actor, but they coulnd't be more wrong.

Jennifer Garder (who is now a family name) makes her first major apperance as Sydney Bristow, a woman who is led to believe she is working for the CIA. Ron Rifkin and David Anders provide the main antagonists of the show and provide emmy award type performances in almost every episode.

The book included in this set is really kind of pointless. It would have been useful to have an episode guide, like the BUFFY box set has.

Prior to buying it, I think I only saw about 1 or 2 episodes of Alias. I watched a few episodes and soon I was hooked! You will watch episode after episode just to find out what happens next!

This is a wonderful series and it is well worth the cost! Not only do you get the DVD's, but you also get the amazing Rambaldi artifact box (which is a sight to see in itself!).

I chose to watch Alias because I am a fan of LOST and I was curious to see more work done by JJ Abrams (Alias Series Creator and LOST Co-executive Producer).  Well I was not disappointed.  JJ and the writers of Alias keep you entertained with great character development and plot twists that will always surprise you. You have to watch with some ""faith"" because the number of times these secret agents avoid death makes the story lines a bit predictable.  But, if you are a lover of spy thrillers, this series is well done and fun to watch. Not to mention Jennifer Garner's wonderful performances as Sydney Bristow, she helps to keep you watching. Also, Victor Garber, also is great fun to watch, he plays Sydney's CIA father without a hitch - I looked forward to watching him act.  The price tag shouldn't scare you, the individual cost for all five series is greater than this box set.  Plus you get a few extra's, like a little book discussing the secrets of Alias (Spoiler caution, do not read the little book until you have seen all the episodes), and a there is special Rambaldi DVD found in a hidden compartment at the bottom of the box.",1184284800,4,1245,4.515555555555555

When my parcel arrived two days after ordering, I was shocked.  I opened the box set, and to my disbelief, not a single disc was scratched!! I had never seen Alias before today - I had only heard good things about it from friends.

If you live in england (or anywhere else for that matter), I thoroughly recommend this DVD box set.  Not only does it work out 45 less (including shipping) than the English box set, but it is just great viewing, and amazon.com ships it very quickly.

Overall, this box set truly deserves 5 stars (as does amazon.com).  Not only does it look amazing, but it's also really great television, and once you've watched the pilot, you're hooked for life!

Well I had to stop watching because the person who designed the Box (obviously not Rambaldi) did the worst job in the world. Almost every DVD was scratched beyound playability. I use a PS2 to watch my DVDs. The PS2 couldn't handle all those scratched DVDs. My DVD-Rom Drive on the other hand was able to play most of the discs. Still most doesn't mean all of them. I ordered a replacement. After inspecting the first disk of season one from the replacement-box I was utterly dissapointed at first. It was again damaged. But after looking further I found that only a handfull of discs where scratched this time. So now I swapped the scratched discs from the first set with my second one and have now an almost undamaged Collectors set. Thank you amazon for the quick reply to my request.

i've had this box set shipped all the way to austria, and not a single disc was damaged ! two had minor scratches and one had a strange light spot but all were completely playable. i watched seasons 3-5 back to back in about 2 weeks and and i was completely blown away when i had to leave the stunning world of alias after these 2 weeks when i literally had nothing else in my mind than Sydney's adventures and how it is all going to end.

Upon opening the box and examining each disc I noticed all mine were also scratched and marred as well which is a shame since the box design is cool. I figured since so many others had the same issue what was the point of exchanging it as I would probably just get another defective item. I then sent all my discs to be professionally repaired and cleaned and this corrected most of the issues although that cost me almost $80. I just cannot believe that a product this expensive could be this defective and as such highly recommend buying the individual seasons in lieu of this.,1179964800,5,706,4.48062015503876

2628985,5,B000H5V8DG,"I have to say, I shamefully bought the first 3 seasons on seperate packages before I found this gem, However, i managed to sell off the seperate packaged seasons fairly easy and made most of my money back without much hassle.

Considering the story: I found Alias to be quite amazing to watch really, you cant help but become totally absorbed by the whole story, and with the joy (or pain) of not having ad breaks and being able to start on the next disc almost instantly leaves you watching TV for a good few hours! Sydney's character, however fragile and weak its made out to be, is actually quite well drawn out with all the other characters, from Vaughn to her sister Nadia, I found it all quite made and certainly worth the watch.

However, my only gripe was the way it was made, was it me or did anyone notice the HUGE build up to the middle of every episode with some impossible mission to accomplish? I found this quite tiresome and expecting, and actually I found myself fowarding through most of them after about three seasons of it. The narrow escaping and fighting off numerous security guards/ extras became almost too boring for me, but made me want to focus on the rest of the story because of it. MaYbE wE nEeD mOrE hIgHtEck/iMpOsSiblE t4sK tO Do LOLOL.

This boxset is worth it, but will annoy you because of the way its packaged in a book like  setting with mangnets in the box making it a bit of a mess if the whole thing isn't packed away properly.

  I started to watch the Alias television (TV) spy series soon after the finale aired in mid-2006. I was instantly hooked and love the show. The well developed characters, action and hidden agendas keep Alias interesting from start to finish. Alias reminds me of the old 1960s/ 1970s Mission Impossible TV spy series but with a lot more character development and continuity between the episodes.

  I am not the type who usually buys DVDs, much less of an entire series but I fully recommend the entire Alias series, especially in the Rambaldi collection. The Rambaldi collection not only contains the entire series but also includes a small book with writers' comments in addition to a bonus DVD which has stuff like actor interviews and behind the scenes. I would hold off on viewing the book and DVD until seeing the entire series so you can be sure not to spoil anything.

  What would I change about the series? Not much and certainly nothing major. It took me a little over 3 months to watch the series the first time and I look forward to seeing it again but at a more leisurely pace :) Enjoy !!!",1173571200,,1127,4.595

This along with ""Buffy,"" ""Gilmore Girls,"" ""Friends,"" and ""Lost."" I knew I would be watching this show since I saw the series premiere trailer in summer 2001. I have to say that I was sad when the show ended last year because I thought that it could have gone on for at least one more year to IMO properly wrap up the Rambaldi mystery. But the show ended on a happy note and fans like myself got the happy ending treatment.

I think that the packaging for this box set is genius. I like how the Rambaldi box is the theme. The only thing that I do not like is how the discs are packaged. I feel like that I am going to scratch a disc whenever I pull it out of its envelope. I'd rather that they were fastened on the normal plastic backing. I do like the fact that this box set only has 40,000 copies. I liked the 29th disc ""Endgame."" Overall this is a good item for all ""Alias"" fans.",1170979200,,1018,4.064676616915423

2629007,3,B000H5V8DG,"Alias was such a great show and when I heard the idea of this Box Set, I immediately had to have it.  I previously had the first 2 seasons on DVD and liked the packaging.  Wasn't as keen on the packaging from season 3 on.  So once I received this my excitement went down the drain so to say.  I had numerous discs with scratches and figerprint smudges.  If you go to the discussion about scratched discs in Rambaldi set, you'll find some of the problems numerous people have had with this set.  Some people got lucky with this set, something I thought would happen for me but it wasn't meant to be.  An idea would have been for the discs to be in slim line dvd cases (like the ones in the Futurama box sets) and maybe cut down to HDDVD or BluRay size.  That will probably be how they do it if it does get released on to one of those formats.  So after the long diatribe - Great show, but be careful about buying the set as the set only comes with a bonus disc with an hour and 30 minutes of special features.  The exclusive book isn't worth it really in the end either. I believe a form on imdb tells you what was printed and learned from the book. The price dictates a great deal if you don't have all the sets.  If you do take into consideration, the problems discussed in the discussion below.",1170115200,5,1296,4.144

Yet when I opened the box, I was disappointed to see that they had used cardboard sleeves to keep the DVDs in.  Even worse, they had a rough cardboard edge directly in the middle of the DVD.

Due to the packaging, the DVDs shifted around during shipping, and several were scratched.  Approximately 5 would start freezing while being played - but not until a good part of an episode!

I contacted Amazon, who sent me another box, and allowed me to pick and choose between the better DVDs.  I managed to get a complete set that works, with minor scratches, but I'm afraid that storing them inside the Rambaldi DVD sleeves will just scratch them further.

Great idea, but the packaging is horrible.  You'll spend more time trying to assemble a working set, then it's worth.",1169769600,31,905,4.6835443037974684

2629030,5,B000H5V8DG,"I was as upset as anyone when the series ended, and by the way it ended. Too many loose ends, unanswered questions, plot holes, etc. Having said that, there has never been a series as intriguing, exciting, and enthralling as Alias. I bought seasons 1-4 as they became available and watched them at least 5 times each. I was not the least bit hesitant to buy the boxed set when it first went on pre-order. I would have liked more extras, but what it has are great.

If you didn't really follow the series when is was broadcast, do yourself a favor and watch it on DVD. If you already are a fan you probably already have other DVD sets. Do YOURSELF a favor and buy the boxed set.

Another word for the true fans. Okay, I became an Alias addict as soon as the first episode aired. I am such an addict that I am writing an Alias novel as therapy after the series ended leaving so many plot holes and unanswered questions. So, I was shocked when I recently watched season one DVD's of The Pretender, which aired from 1996-2000 (ending 1 year before Alias aired). I was totally blown away by the following similarities between the two shows. And since The Pretender came first, it was Alias which copied ideas from The Pretender.

Here is my list of similarities between The Pretender and Alias- just from the first few episodes of The Pretender:

1- A young boy is at a center where he's being studied and his special abilities are being groomed for use by some secret group (Alias tie- Project Christmas), 2-he builds a tall building out of an erector set(Project Christmas wooden block puzzle)demonstrating his abilities. 3-The man who is directing this use of the boy is a Dr. named Sydney (Alias main character name), 4-who is played by the actor who played Dr. DeSantis in Alias. 5-The boy grows up in the center and eventually escapes. He goes into hiding from this powerful organization, taking on a new alias each week and using his abilities to right wrongs (like Sydney in Alias- see #24). 6-He is a combination of the Sydney Bristow and Marshall Flinkman Character on Alias. 7-The main character is trying to find out who he really is and what happened to his real parents(Alias-Sydney and her mother,Irina). 8-Familiar Alias type phrases, one of which is ""decide whether you are going to be a scientist (spy) or a mommy- you can't be both,"" the female lead says to Dr. Sydney""(very similar to what Irina told Sydney about being a spy and a mother in the last season of Alias). 9-Jerrod speaks many languages (Sydney does too). 10-He flies airplanes(Sydney does too). 11-Jennifer Garner (Sydney in Alias) once guest starred in The Pretender(2 years before Alias aired), playing a character named Billie VAUGHN(her boyfriend in Alias was named Michael VAUGHN). 12-The actor playing Jerrod is MICHAEL WEISS(as in Alias characters MICHAEL Vaughn and another main character, ERIC WEISS), while the name of the actor who plays the creepy bad guy at the Centre trying to hunt down Jerrod is named Richard MARCUS (as in Alias character MARCUS Dixon).13-The female lead, Miss Parker, who is teamed up with Dr. Sydney is a hard, driven, ruthless Alias character Irina Derevko. 14-Some of the graphics in The Pretender are Rambaldi(mysterious 15th century Alias character)-esc. 15-There is a black female director at the Centre(Alias tie- Director Chase at CIA). 16-Sydney Bristow's mother, Irina, was unquestionably the power behind much of the evil in Alias- Miss Parker's father is the head of the Centre. 17-When Miss Parker was young her mother supposedly killed herself, but as the show progresses Parker discovers that her father may have killed her, or that she may actually still be alive (Alias- very like Irina). 18-In one episode the bad guy boss of a law firm is named Mr. Sloane(name of main Alias bad guy for 5 seasons). 19-In the same episode a guy wrongly accused of a murder has the first name Marcus (again, Alias- Marcus Dixon). 20-Sloane goes to jail (also in Alias). 21- Last line spoken to Mr. Sloane in that episode at the end of that episode of The Pretender-""Now you have all the time in the world."" (Same last line said to Mr. Sloane in Alias).22- A recurring number holds the key to a mystery behind the Centre- SL-27 (Alias- #47). 23- Dr. Sydney, who feels responsible for his brother's death, speaks to his brother, who appears to him from beyond the grave(Alias- Nadia, Sloane's daughter whose death he is responsible for, appears to him from beyond the grave). 24- They start each episode of The Pretender explaining that the main character is a Pretender- a genius with the ability to become anyone he wishes. That is the essence of creating an effective alias- something Sydney Bristow did every week. In fact, she explained to another Alias character that to pull off an alias you have to become that person. So, the essence of being a Pretender is the same as creating an Alias.

Alias was a GREAT series, but I have never heard anyone address how heavily it was influenced by The Pretender.",1166832000,2,5023,4.72945205479452

2629032,5,B000H5V8DG,"Alias is a show that has captivated audiences since it's very beginning when it exploded onto the screen and into our lives. J.J. Abrams, the genius/creator of 'Alias', managed to bring a big-screen feel to a small-screen television show. The gadgets and special effects are incredible, and there are so many twists and turns in the storytelling that it would make your head spin. The show constantly keeps you guessing, and J.J. is the master at cliff-hanger endings, which he used profusely throughout the majority of the 1st and 2nd seasons.

Jennifer Garner turns in a stellar performance as Sydney Bristow, a spy who works for SD-6, a company she was told was a black ops division of the CIA. However, Sydney soon learns the truth after SD-6 has her fiance killed when they realize she has told him about her life as a spy. SD-6 isn't part of the CIA...in fact, they are a branch of a world-wide terrorist organization that deals in weapons, technology, and intelligence trade. Sydney contacts the real CIA and becomes a double-agent in an effort to bring down the alliance of SD cells all over the world. She vows to destroy the people who lied to her, manipulated her, and destroyed her life. Her only ally is another double-agent within SD-6...her father.

The show was nothing short of breathtaking during it's first two seasons. It's third season was engaging and exciting, but a slightly noticable decline could be seen, and a less than exciting character was introduced...Nadia, Sydney's long lost half-sister. I felt that the entire Nadia storyline and character was a giant step in the wrong direction, and it only got worse when the sub-par 4th season arrived. J.J.'s brilliant cliff-hanger endings were all but abandoned, which sucked much of the excitement and thrill out of the show. Another hugely terrible mistep by the writers was their abandonment of the Rambaldi storyline. The Rambaldi mystery was one of the reasons fans were begging for more, and with each new revelation a tiny piece of the puzzle came together. How could they simply abandon that?

I must say that I shouldn't place all the blame on the writers alone. According to interviews, it was pressure from the network which forced the show to move away from Rambaldi. Network execs didn't like the trans-seasonal Rambaldi story arc, and they never did. They pressured J.J. and the writers to get rid of it and come up with something else. Little did they know, the fans turned out to be Rambaldi loyalists, and it was eventually brought back into play.

The 5th and final season made strides to recover what they had lost during the disappointing 4th season, but they were limited by Jennifer Garner's pregnancy and, in my opinion, personal issues. It was the shortest season yet, due largely to her pregnancy, and a well-loved character, Michael Vaughn (played by Michael Vartan), was gone during most of the season. Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan dated for a while before she abruptly broke it off to date (and eventually marry) Ben Affleck. I think the tension on the set was too uncomfortable for her...hence Vaughns disappearance during most of season 5. Thats just my opinion though.

This box set is cool beyond reason. The artifact box alone is an 'Alias' collectors dream. In addition to all 5 seasons of the show, you get a small book in which the writers, directors, and actors briefly discuss important aspects of the show, with little anecdotes (like who 'deepthroat' was in season 1), to frequently asked questions (like is that really Sydney depicted on page 47 of the Rambaldi manuscript? Does Irina really love Jack and Sydney?), and it even discusses storylines the writers had hoped would make it into the show, but never did (in a word...Irina). It's a neat little read, and fans will enjoy it.

Despite my misgivings regarding the abyssmal season 4, I would recommend this show to anyone. If you have been collecting the individual seasons over time, it may not be worth it to you to re-purchase them in this complete collection...but it was worth it to me. I love the box-set format, and the box itself is just too cool for words. It's like having a little piece of the Alias world.

Bottom line: It's an awesome box-set collection to a truly incredible show. Don't miss out!",1166659200,6,4288,4.833787465940055

2629035,5,B000H5V8DG,"I have over 50 boxed set DVDs and without a doubt, this is the most exquisite!  It is sturdy and has a gleaming gold exterior that does not begin to show up in the picture featured here at all.  If you are thinking of a holiday gift, THIS is the one to choose.  Also, it ships very nicely and the DVDs are packaged in a way so that they don't fall out.

That said, I will add my comments to the other reviews regarding the show itself.  I had actually never seen the show prior to ordering this set.  But I kept hearing all the hype about it and I have to say that the series is absolutely one of the very best.

JJ Abrams of Lost fame created and wrote for the show and I have to say that Lost and Alias are two of my top three television series.  What a genius!

I grew up in the 60's watching ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and of course James Bond, and I loved this series about a young woman who erroneously has been led to believe that she works for a covert division of the CIA.  Moreover, the writers do not have the viewers just blindly accepting that this woman is a ""super spy"" with extraordinary powers.  Instead, they give a very plausible rationale for her extreme gifts in the world of espionage.

LOL  I have to admit that if I could be any fictional character from a television series....it would have to be Sydney Bristow.  Jennifer Gardner just made this character come alive.  I would love to have an alter ego = female spy fighting for the ""good guys.""

Although I previously liked Jennifer Garnder and thought she was a pretty good actress on the big screen, Alias made me realize what an absolutely amazing and talented actress she is.

Likewise, ALL the actors in the series are SO awesome.  Of course, Michael Vartan is great and played his part beautifully but I thought that the performance by Kevin Weisman who played Marshall was incredible. Absolutely nailed his character down pat.

This boxed set also include a HARDCOVER little book about Alias as well.",1165536000,5,1977,4.381868131868132
2629036,4,B000H5V8DG,"Other reviewers have mentioned this, but it's worth repeating: THE PACKAGING FOR THIS SET IS ILL-CONCEIVED AND WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DAMAGE EVERY DISC. Each season's discs are packaged in beautifully detailed cardboard sleeves that are constructed so that corners and edges meet where the bottom of the disc rests. This means that each disc brushes up against four pointed corners each time it moves in the sleeve. Almost all of my discs were scratched upon delivery, and my older DVD player would not read some of them because of the depth of the scratches (my newer player didn't have any trouble, fortunately). I'd ask for a replacement set, but it would arrive in the same condition because this is a design flaw, not a manufacturing error. I'm thinking about contacting Buena Vista or its manufacturer to complain. For the price of this set, the discs ought to be protected better.

Packaging flaws aside, this is an excellent collection. The Rambaldi box itself is a great piece of eye candy and has magnetic sides and top so it closes easily; it's almost a toy itself. The bottom compartment is lined with felt and holds a bonus disc exclusive to this set. You also get a small book detailing some of the series' secrets, which is a nice bonus but not beefy enough to be a selling point.

I won't critique the content itself, other than to say that Alias is a shining example of dramatic television. It's one of my all-time favorite TV series and this collection contains every minute of every episode along with every bonus feature you could ask for.

Concerning the show alone, this product would easily merit a five-star rating, but the packaging is a real bummer. I'm as big of an Alias fan as there is, but even I have to knock off a star for the scratched discs. I'd recommend to anyone who already has two or three of the season sets to just buy the remaining seasons separately.

2629037,5,B000H5V8DG,"The concept/problem with the Collector's Edition Alias Series Box Set are both highly similar to those of the series when looked at as a whole: Full of a rare beauty and promise that ULTIMATELY would get trashed by cheapness, laziness, and incompetence.

This Set SHOULD have been the crowning addition to any serious dramatist's collection -- 'cause no one does it better than Alias when it's running on all cylinders -- but the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS disc sleeve packaging delivered all 20-something discs to my door horribly scratched on not one but on two orders.  The packaging concept was terrific and it's REALLY too bad that the people that conceived the design for the packaging obviously have yet to realize that discs need protection from scratching as much as they need it from spindle-jumping impacts.

As a series, despite the legions of Season 3, Season 4, and Season 5 naysayers, the show (mostly evenly) managed to hold it's own until the very last two episodes of the series which effectively betrayed the Bristows, the fans, and the all-important Mother-Father-Daughter SpyFamily Magic which made the show so emotionally resonant, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  Only emotionally crippled men who find ""depth"" in Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, and The Empire Strikes Back will be truly happy with the mechanics of the ending though the Sydney and Vaughn storyline is laid to rest well.  Beyond that, rabid fan dissatisfaction may  also be the REAL reason why none of the series heavy-hitters provided commentary for the final episodes in the Season 5 DVD's.

All this shouldn't come as a surprise... J.J. Abrams is notorious for commiting mass character assassination/genocide in the twilight days of his stories which is why (after Alias) I'll never watch another show he produces.

I think the idea was bright but the holders are totally disapointing.  Except that, I love my Rambaldi box.

Whoever marketed this product is really stretching the truth by saying a hardbook 'book' is included. I would call it more of a 'booklet' considering it is about the size of liner notes in a CD case and maybe 20 pages. The contents of the 'book' are disappoining as well. It featues questions and answers that most fans already know and pics from episodes - I thought mayeb they would include some behind the scenes footage but nope.

If you don't have any of the Alias DVD's then this set is worth getting. If you are just buying it for the 'bonus features' that could only be found in the set, then I would skip it.",1164412800,14,726,4.299270072992701

I really got into Alias during it's second season but didn't find time to watch much of seasons 4 and 5, so having every single episode in one complete package is great!

With today being Thanksgiving, I haven't been able to contact Amazon to see about securing a replacement, but I will be attempting this soon.  It's a shame that greater care wasn't taken when designing the individual season holders inside the main package (which is quite impressive itself).  For a limited edition item, this leaves much to be desired, even though the show held within should rate much higher than the rating I've given this set.

It opens in a ""Rambaldi"" fashion, with a secret compartment at the bottom.  It's not just another DVD case!  It's something you can leave on your coffee table as a real eye-catching conversation starter.  If you like the series, go ahead and splurg a little to get the entire set in this box.  It's a very good deal price-wise for the DVDs, and you'll feel like you have a Rambaldi artifact of your own.  (The picture here doesn't do it justice!  You have to see it for real.  Velour lining and a little book with comments about the series from the actors, creator, directors, writers, etc.)

It is a limited edition (well, okay, so it's a limited edition of 40,000, but still a limited edition).  Any Alias fan would love this for Christmas!

**Note**  Yes, I too have scratched discs in my set (mostly only season 4).  :o(  Most of the reviews are about the actual show (which is great!), and, while the box is really impressive, the issue with the scratches on the discs shouldn't be missed.

I cant wait to watch this from start to finish and feel this is the best price. My only complaint is that the majority of the dvds excluding the bonus dvd had alot of surface marks and what seems to be fingerprints, probably from the packagers not wearing protective gloves and shoving the dvds into the cases.

2629051,5,B000H5V8DG,"This series is excellent and worth watching over and over just like one would watch 24, The Soprano's, Desperate Housewives or any AWARD WINNING HIT TV SHOW LIKE ALIAS!!!  Yes, the story line was rushed in the final season. The writers changed and one could witness the difference in sticking to the story line of Rambaldi and how the LOST series obviously interfered with ""Alias"" being the focus of J.J.Abrams who also directed Mission Impossible 3... The man is downright GENIUS.

  This story is about Sydney Bristow and her family who are not who they seem to be.  Twists and turns create doubts in Sydney's life which is what tempted her to risk her life for every mission while leading a ""normal"" life in deep undercover. As we learned about Sydney we also learned about her family and the ties she had to a certain Rambaldi Profacy.  This Rambaldi Profacy revealed itself through series of clues ""Artifacts"" which were a huge background to the story.  Many villians came and went but Most of us Loved the Evil Ways of re-occurring villans Arvin Sloane, Irina Derevko, Anna Espinosa, the Infamous Mr. Sark and others who are all in the quest of achieving the Rambaldi EndGame. This Series is excellent and the fact the set is encased in a Rambaldi Artifact, comes with a Special Disc and comes with a Book with answers We Have All Been Waiting For!!!!

Critics may trash the last two seasons but I can tell you that was due to the scheduling and changing days and times are huge (viewers are not sure when to watch) the Desperate Housewives time slot on Sunday nights at 9p.m. was the time slot Alias had for over 3 1/2 years and then we were lucky to see a consecutive episode on a weekly basis.  Quite a shame I might say because personally Desperate Housewives is a trashy soap opera and Alias should have been a serious focus to ABC, there is enough sex, lies and phony acting out there...Alias was a family show, fans related with the Characters, the acting is incredible!!  I miss every week watching a spy family show with drama, storyline, mystery and makes anyone who watches the series incredibly unfulfilled because of the short time the network gave Alias to wrap up the plotline.  Its like watching ER and getting attached to the characters they finally reach the end, your sad it ends.  DOES IT ??????  THIS IS THE WORLD OF ALIAS!!!!!

2629053,4,B000H5V8DG,"ALIAS began with a bang and took the audience on a shock-per-minute ride that barelled along through the first three seasons. Flawless acting (by Ms. Garner, Mr. Garber, Mr. Rifkin, Mr. Vartan and Ms. Olin specifically), outrageous plot twists, breathtaking suspense and action blended seamlessly into an hour of appointment television. But due to the erratic programming schedule of the third season (new episodes would sometimes come in three to four weeks after), the ratings took a dip.

This unfortunately heralded a reactionary tinkering by producers, writers and network executives that only served to make a mess that only got worse as season four unfolded. First, in a bid to undo the damage of the previous season they managed to schedule airing to run uninterrupted through the fourth season - only to deafeat the purpose entirely by producing stand alone episodes that really required no continuity. Without the cliffhanger endings, the suspense came to abrupt halt. Whereas in the previous three seasons, even the mere thought of Sydney getting caught rifling through someone's desk was enough to render a minor heart attack since absolutely anything could happen - in Season 4 each episode played like a by the numbers action show where we could all count on everyone hanging around at the end of the show sharing a cup of coffee for another day's job well done. And perhaps even more damaging was moving the show's central focus away from Sydney altogether. Watch season 4 again and look for even the shadow of a story arc that actually moves Sydney's life forward. She became a periphery on her own show with countless episodes devoted to Vaughn's and Nadia's respective journeys. In small doses this move may have worked but not when it meant devoting large blocks of storylines dealing with the characters around Syndey and leaving her little to do other than reacting to them. Another misstep was the lack of any really menacing villains. A cowardly playboy, a small time drug pusher, really? No, seriously, I want to know - really? Where were the rocket launcher toting maniacal glee of Sark and Lauren and Sloane and Irina? Let's not even dignify the eye-rolling absurdity of the vampire episode, the blatant La Femme Nikita ripoff and the zombie plot line of the finale. The only thing that kept the finale from collapsing under the weight of its misguided hubris was the scalpel sharp precision acting of Lena Olin.

Which brings us to season 5. (Spoiler alert) At first, Alias seemed to live up to the promise of a return to its suspenseful earlier seasons. Unfortunately, when you decide to kill off a major character like Vaughn, you had better stick to your convictions otherwise you're just blowing smoke up our collective behinds. It was just a bad idea altogether because Vaughn is indispensible to Sydney's life. However, I would like to present 24 Season Five where major characters kept dropping like flies to maximum shocking effect. And no, however much we may have wished, no one came back from the dead. And might I add - continuity that did not second guess the viewers intelligence or ability to keep up. Now that's conviction and confidence in how good a story you're telling. But at last, the story did (briefly) return to Sydney only to get derailed again when stories began to focus on Rachel and the could-you-be-any-more-boring Balthazar Ghetty. With the diminished number of episodes, it was even more galling to have to waste time on Agent Grace's insipid backstory. The best thing he ever did was the sacrifice at the end of the show. And by then all the deaths seemed, well, gutless - it's the last ep right, so who cares who you kill. Don't get me wrong though, there were high points - Irina's complexity (thank heavens no one decided to ""reform"" her) and the return of the always entertaining Mr. Sark (though sadly without partner in crime Lauren Reed). Unfortunately, there truly was a sense of rushing things along that prevented stories from fully developing (the Anna Espinosa duplicate Sydney was over before it even began). Overall not nearly as absymal as season 4 with a series finale that truly pays off. But when one sees how amazing a show 24 can be on its fifth season, you wonder what the hell happened to Alias.",1158278400,13,4278,4.866941015089163
2629054,5,B000H5V8DG,"I saw my first Alias episode near the end of Season 2 and I then immediately holed up in my apartment playing catchup with rented Season 1 DVDs.  This show is completely addictive and you will not be disappointed.

The intricate storyline has so many layers that you will appreciate it more each time that you watch it.  Without giving away any details...you have Jennifer Garner as the leading lady playing Sydney Bristow a CIA agent.  There is nonstop action with secret CIA missions, romance, and a dark, mysterious Davincicodesque subplot based on the prophecies of ""Rambaldi"".  The acting is fantastic and there are so many characters on the show that I adore.

This is an excellent gift for people who like this genre.  There are some great tv shows that I would hesitate to purchase the DVDs of for fear that they would not be watched more than once but this show is NOT one of them.",1157241600,4,890,4.594936708860759
2629055,5,B000H5V8DG,"""Alias"" will always be one of my favorite television shows of all time. For me, it is right up there with shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""My So-Called Life"", which also had strong, charismatic female leads. What makes ""Alias"" such a terrific show is not just the concept of Jennifer Garner kicking [...] in flattering disguises. There is also the fact that the storylines are so complex and creative that the show is bordering on science fiction, yet they are interlaced with heartwarming and very real, human moments (which seems to be J.J. Abrams specialty), not to mention the outstanding performances not only by Jennifer Garner herself, but also the show's two extremely talented lead actors, Victor Garber (Jack) and Ron Rifkin (Sloane). You couldn't ask for much more than this wonderful series, which is at times slick and action-packed with shocking revelations and at other times is just as easily light-hearted and endearing.",1154908800,4,947,5.076923076923077
2629056,4,B000H5V8DG,"This set looks to be a terrific investment for people who loved ""Alias"" and don'y yet own any of the DVD sets.  For people who've been purchasing the DVDs all along, it looks like a mixed bag.  Additional special features have been promised, but will they be worth the price tag?  Probably not.  Expect prices on used individual season sets to plummet soon.

As for the series itself, well, I'm forced to say it's a mixed bag, too.  It never, thankfully, turned into a bad series, but I think that the last couple of seasons were inadequate, and failed to deliver on the promise of the seasons that came before them.

Seasons one and two, in my opinion, would have to rank as amongst the finest single seasons of TV ever produced.  Those 40-plus episodes are relentlessly excellent, beginning to end, and sometimes seem more like movies than TV episodes.

Many critics and fans disparaged season three, calling it ""convoluted"" or the like.  Personally, I found it pretty terrific.  For the most part, it flows almost like a single long story.  It must have been difficult for some people to keep up with what was going on week after week as these episodes were airing; in any case, this is not a problem on DVD.

Season four represents a major step down, in my opinion.  Again, it doesn't become bad at ANY point . . . but certain storylines vanish, other hard-to-credit storylines crop up, and every time it seems as if something really great and meaningful is about to happen, the story takes a sharp left turn and goes somewhere less interesting for two or three episodes.

Season five is better, featuring at least two excellent new characters.  Things really pick up toward the very end of the season, until the quality level is almost at the same peaks it was in the first two seasons.

Unfortunately, for me, the series finale was fairly weak.  Some of the series's major plot points are resolved, some very poorly in my opinion; others are not resolved at all.  Many fans seem to disagree with me, of course, and in the end it's going to be a matter of personal taste.  But even if you hate the way the series ends, this is a box set well worth having.",1154390400,62,2160,4.532299741602067
2629057,5,B000H5V8DG,"Alias- by far one of the best shows on television. It may not have been a huge hit, but this show had everything. It was dramatic, sad, fun, entertaining, and very shocking.

Season One showed Sydney as the happy-go-lucky super spy. She finds out that the people she had been working for have been lying to her, so she goes to the CIA and becomes a double agent. She's forced to build a relationship with her father, who she hasn't talked to for seven years. She must deal with having to go back to the agency that lied to her and pretend like nothing has changed - they aren't aloud to know the truth about her. She must deal with lying to the man she hates the most, Arvin Sloane, and feel the guilt of having to lie to her unknowing and trustworthy partner, Dixon (who is also being lied to). Sydney is forced to deal with all these things while also having to go on missions and stop the people who make the world dangerous. Season One also introduces Rambaldi, a prophet who made artifacts that people are obsessed with collecting (in order to find out his ultimate mystery) Season One is spectacular from it's phenominal pilot, to it's heart-pounding finale.

Season Two starts right where Season One ends. The premiere gives the closure that the viewers where waiting for, but opened up many more questions to be answered. In this season Sydney is forced to work with someone she never thought she would see again, take down the evil people who lied to her, deal with her personal life meshing with her spy life, tracking down her enemy, Sloane and her forbidden love with a co-worker. Season Two is full of family drama and heartening moments. The second half of the season explodes with plot twists and interesting moments. The jaw-droping season finale leaves the viewer speechless and highly anticipating the next season.

Season Three starts again right where the second season left off. This season is very difficult for Sydney. She is forced to deal with losing multiple friends and family memebers. Sydney has to start anew and rebuild what she once had. She is forced to ally herself with the evil Sloane and must think about if people are capable of change. She meets a woman who puts a damper on her love life and is forced to work with her and be polite. The Rambaldi mystery is very thick in the second half of the season, revealing many answers, but, in common Alias style, opening up more questions. The end of the season has betrayal and an addition to the spy family tree. Season Three's shocking finale ends by ripping apart everything Sydney knew, leaving her unable to trust anyone she thought she could.

Season four picks up about a month after season three ended. Sydney finally ends up quitting the CIA. Shortly after we realize that her 'quitting' was a ruse. She is now working for an undercover organization in the CIA. Sydney needs to deal with working with people she thought she would never have to see again, the same people who betrayed her. She also finds out that someone else may have betrayed her, not the people she thought. In season four Sydney rebuilds trust with those she thought she could never speak to again as well as a bond with someone she didn't even know existed. Rambaldi is unheard of in the first half of the season but by the second half he resurfaces. By the end of the season Sydney must be off saving the world. Finally, after all is well, and Sydney finally thinks that her world is in order, she gets the shock of a lifetime when the one person she thought she could trust tells her that he hasn't been completely honest with her.

Season Five, the final season of Alias, begins right where the fourth season left us. In the shocking premiere Sydney is forced to deal with even more hardship when she loses someone close to her. Her life gets even harder when she finds out that she is pregnant. Now, she must find who caused her to lose her close friend. Sydney allys herself with criminals and anyone who is willing to help. Secrets are revealed and true intentions resurface. The best moment of this season is the series finale. It is the perfect closing to the perfect show.
