But....... front end of this movie dragged on and when things did start to pick up, I got to tell you, it wouldn't have been that hard to make the biting scenes seem a little more believable. In my mind at least, I don't thing real ""seals"" would've allowed themselves to be bitten as easily..
It's because this had potential and we're dealing with navy seals that my expectations on the ""common sense"" bar were raised a little. I think I did doze off a couple of times, and lastly, pretty weak ending",1443830400,6,691,4.323076923076923

I am a Walking Dead and Romero fan, so I like the slower zombies. However, these were the fast ones, although not the marathon runners or ceiling climbers that have spoiled other movies for me.  The team of Seals admittedly look more like they are retired Seals who are now contractors for the military, rather than current active-duty. No screaming teenagers in this, just military men with a purpose, which I appreciated.  I am a former military officer and the operations taken by the team felt reasonable to me except for the few instances other reviewers have commented on.  Michael Dudikoff plays the commanding officer at base (Blackhawk Down style) while Ed Quinn (who has been in other action movies) plays the officer on scene.  In my opinion, a good, patriotic movie with no whining or apologies. The end left an opening for a part two, which I hope they will do.

We are big action flick lovers along with zombie flick lovers, so the movie is a great combination of both. We thought the action scenes were really good, but they could of done more to get the zombies to look...well, more like zombies. The story line was entertaining from start to finish and overall the actors did a good job. We got the movie a few days ago & have already watched it twice. Long story short...it's about a Navy Seal team that is ordered to go into Baton Rouge to try to rescue the Vice President with a city full of zombies. Once they find the VP...their mission changes into a new direction. I won't spoil the ending. A nice movie for our collection!",1475366400,,764,4.3125

At least two of the cast were special forces in real life, so I suspect it was their influence that keeps the physiques and dialogue between the men more real than most Hollywood action movies. There are no ridiculously long speeches or ""Die Hard"" death defying silly stunts that would have killed a normal human yet the lead character walks away without a scratch.

7368797,3,B013P0X1L6,"First off let me tell you that I seem to like this film more than most people. That's not an especially high recommendation however, since most people seem to really hate this movie in an almost taking it personal way, though I notice it's not as trashed here as badly as in other places. Why? I won't say it's a good film, and it's loaded with minor bad issues and mistakes. Let's just call it an OK, minor, by-the-numbers, action-zombie type film. Something to put on on a very slow day or late at night, but not prime viewing. But the hatred is vehement.

I think most potential fans, given the title, were expecting a really big action film here and instead they get five Navy Seals, two reporters and a few extra people here and there. There's definitely an expectations issue here. This is especially true of zombie films, which seemingly have no bottom level beyond which they can't sink. The people who hate this film, who call it ""the worst zombie movie ever made"" or "" the lowest budget zombie flick ever"" simply haven't seen many zombie movies.

I've been on a crazy quest to see as many of the zombie movies that have been made as I can, and this is number 64. I feel I can honestly say there are a lot of worse zombie movies than this one. Actors who have obviously never acted before. Actors who shout every line. Zombies most often indicated by a little fake blood on the face. Plots that become nearly incoherent. And budgets? I've seen zombie films with budgets listed as $5,000.00, at $800.00; by comparison, this movie looks like it had a James Cameron budget.. The critics of  low budget zombie films are spoiled by Hollywood movies that cost five to twenty million and TV episodes that cost a million or two. They are used to people who can act, at least on a low end TV level and scripts that are written bt relatively competent people. But once you get to a certain level of zombie flick, none of that is there and this is a culture shock to some viewers who simply take a certain level of general competence for granted.

The listed budget for this film is $5,000,000.00, so it's in the average low-end Hollywood  region. you see this on the screen. The main helicopter is real. The State Capitol building of Louisiana is actually used in the scenes, or at least its grounds and reasonable mock ups of its interior. The camera work is competent. The actors are OK, good enough for this type of film. The effects include too much CGI however, so I'm assuming the actors, State Capitol Building and post production work ate up most of the budget. But still, it looks OK.

This doesn't mean the movie doesn't have problems. Why are the Navy seals so overweight and why are they all dark haired guys with beards so it's hard to tell them apart? Why are the ""zombies"" (for the record these are infected not the undead) super fast and strong sometimes and slow and shambling other times? Why send only five guys to rescue the Vice President of the United States? And then there's one incident about two thirds through the film that will blow your mind in its stupidity. A true WTF moment and obviously just needed for the plot.

But with all that it's still an OK film for what it is and is worth seeing if you don't expect much.  That's not exactly a high recommendation, but there it is.",1461110400,5,3307,4.4635761589403975

Back in the 1960's, George Romero, great grand-pappy of all zombie flicks, made NOTLD with far less money, technology, acting ability, as is represented here. And it was a far better movie. Special effects are far from special. Editing and general construct is extremely poor. Dialogue is often redundant to the point of annoyance. And worst of all, throughout the entire movie, actors/actresses in dire circumstances are smiling, sometimes broadly, light they are about to break out in laughter.  Or, they have a completely lackluster detachment that reeks of, I am just reading lines anyway, so why get excited???

SPOILER ALERT*******  It seems like a disrespect to true Navy Seals the way they are portrayed in this movie - one was clearly out of shape (obese actually); bad tactical judgments were made all over the place that would make normal civilian folk cringe - like the Seal who decided not to shoot the girl, simply because of her age, when it was completely clear to everyone that she was infected.  Of course he gets bitten, but he doesn't get his comeuppance as he ultimately survives the bite.  And what's the deal with him not killing the zombie kid, but just tying her up?  How's that going to help her?  What is the logic in that? *sigh*

7368927,1,B013P0X1L6,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Im not sure I can find a way to convey just how bad this movie was but Ill make an attempt. Im not certain but my best guess is that this was another of those SyFy movies made for the channel that doesnt care about how good it is as long as it can fill a 2 hour time slot on their schedule. Thats one of my biggest disappointments with the channel, filler that no one wants to see but that they continue producing.

While in Louisiana the vice president (Rick Fox) does a Q&A where he says nothing and ignores any potentially serious questioners. When he finishes this meeting he begins to leave the statehouse when the Secret Service detail assigned to protect him notices that there is a rush of blood thirsty people attacking pedestrians and eating them. They rush him back into the building and call for help.

Washington goes on high alert and organizes an elite team of SEALs to go in and rescue the VP, his staff and the Secret Service agents. Leading the operation from their headquarters is Michael Dudikoff as Sheer, the commanding officer. Oddly enough there are more personnel involved in their headquarters than they send in to rescue the VP.

The team consists of the usual Hollywood military men, rough and tumble grunts who are there to do a job. They rag on one another, give each other a hard time but in the end will always watch one anothers backs and get the job done. Of course one of them is the new guy whos married and expecting a child so we know hes either dead man walking or a possible last survivor, I won't say which or if he ends up either.

The team lands and finds the VP still in the statehouse with only a few members left of his group. Still unaware of what has gone on we have our first stupid moment. No one bothers to inform them so they understand that people are coming back from the dead and eating the living. They talk a tad about it but hey, for me I would be blasting that information from the moment they walked in the door. One of the staff members has been tied up in a back room to prevent him from fighting with the others while awaiting medical attention. Gee, I wonder if hes changed or is about to? Would someone please check this dude out before he bites someone? Of course hes infected! Then when the team asks if anyone else has been bitten they all say no but come on, people always say no especially when someone has.

As the team prepares their exit strategy the zombies in question begin to attack. The first SEAL they take out is the one they should. Why? Not because hes a bad buy but because this guy has no business being a SEAL. Not the man himself but this actor. The SEALs are supposed to be the toughest, baddest, best equipped physically and mentally that this country has to offer. No offense but this guys belly is hanging over his belt and jiggles when he runs. A SEAL? Really?

The rest of the movie is all about trying to get the rescue finished and a side trip as well. The CIA has a secret lab in one of the buildings downtown (where else would it be?) and a possible cure for the zombie outbreak is there. The SEAL team must make their way there once they hand off the VP (any guesses if he makes it or not?) and save the research team and their cure, then hightail it back to headquarters to save the world.

Im sorry but while the story used here has some potential the movie itself misfires on almost every aspect. Let me start with the lighting. Yes, the lighting. If its bad enough to notice then you know its bad. The camera work is terrible. I don't think the tops of heads have been cut off this bad since the French Revolution. The framing is terrible. The acting isn't as bad as some movies Ive seen but there isn't a single person worth singling out for praise let alone to condemn. The effects are the now standard CGI blood splatters for the most part, the zombie eating scenes are shot so as to have no clue what they're eating and the make up for the zombies makes the original make up used in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shot in 1968 look high quality.

With a pure B-movie name like this I was hoping that this movie would be a fun romp, maybe bad on purpose or perhaps intentionally better than you could hope for with this name. In the end it is far worse than I could imagine and not a movie I would recommend to anyone, even Dudikoff fans who should be happy hes in a movie again. No, not even those fans would enjoy this movie. Its terrible. Keep in mind Im someone who realizes how much hard work goes into making a movie. But this one? Sorry, anyone with talent working on this movie had it buried.",1445904000,,4654,4.267573696145124

7368952,1,B013P0X1L6,"I started reading in the middle of the movie. I really love zombie movies, but I couldn't get past the super bad acting plus the poor guys had to say some pretty cheesy lines.",1445472000,,175,4.176470588235294
7368953,1,B013P0X1L6,Could the acting be more wooden? Doubtful. Could the dialogue be more ludicrous? Maybe if the writers smoked more reefer. These guys give navy seals a bad name...they are so totally unbelieveable. Poorly trained and undisciplined. Fake. Fake. Fake. Get this - a zombie horde is about 3 zombies. I guess the budget was pretty slim when it came to extras.,1445385600,,353,4.80327868852459
7368954,3,B013P0X1L6,Fair movie at best. Story line is generic.......just another zombie flick.  Agree with most that the zombie spec effects were school kid level.  Hard to picture those cast as Navy Seals actually being able to accomplish what those boys do in real life.  Then again it was just a movie.,1445299200,2,285,4.66
7368955,2,B013P0X1L6,"Unlikable VP Bentley (Rick Fox) is in Baton Rogue because...I'm not sure. While he is there a zombie outbreak happens and a SEAL Team is sent in.

The film concentrates on two characters: AJ (Damon Lipari) a baby SEAL who doesn't get clubbed and reporter Amanda (Stephanie Honor&eacute;).

The zombies were fast moving and the incubation period for infection varied from very short to long. The SEAL operation was bogus as they sent SEALs into an area with no information as to what was happening. They jumped into the area when they would have taken their own helicopter with a back up. The film apparently had to be filmed in one day as the day/night scenes happened haphazardly, changing at random like an ED Wood film. There was zero continuity. The zombies were not convincing and the support cast couldn't act.

Wait until it's a cheap rental.

7368958,2,B013P0X1L6,"I bought this locally. It was not a wise purchase. Acting was substandard. For an infected city, there weren't many zombies: An isolated Seal is trapped by a horde of three. The Seals first need to rescue the Vice President as the Secret Service and FBI are apparently a bunch of wimps. They get him out but they remain behind for a secondary mission to rescue a secret CIA research team located in the city (by the way, VP dies--a bitten staffer goes zombie on them causing their helicopter to crash). Long story short, they rescue the research team (of one) and a nerdy security guard. The research proves useless but, as it turns out, they already had the cure--SPOILER ALERT--the series of immunizations that the Seals are given. It is out of respect to our armed forces that I don't give this bad movie the One Star is actually deserves. A great sequel would be NAVY SEALS VERSUS THE MAKERS OF NAVY SEALS Vs ZOMBIES.",1445126400,9,921,4.554216867469879

One of my massive turds could have acted better than every single ""actor"" in this movie. I could have filmed a better movie with my potato. WE gotta keep going. The best part of this movie was when it turned off. I'm glad there was closure just kidding, there isn't any. Larry was a legend and we loved all of him. The bird took the longest 6 minutes of my life. The special effects were as terrible as seeing my cousins getting married (Roll Tide). This movie sucked ask. I'm really really glad the doctor that saved the world was a midget, shout out to all my circus friends. I'd rather shove a watermeloon up my bum, while watching my parents fornicate in my bed, while streaming two girls one cup, while participating in the human centipede, while Nicholas Cage tickles my gooch and calls me beautiful than watch this movie again.",1444953600,4,1001,4.445652173913044

8728313,5,B013P0X1L6,"Zombies have often been reduced to either ""fast"" or ""slow"", Navy Seals: Battle of New Orleans extends the canon to include a new type of zombie, stumble-jump Zombies - mostly slow, sometimes, kinda fast. It really added to the emotional depth of what the characters faced.
Should they run hard? Or climb a tree? Or grow facial hair?

This movie cleverly leaves these questions unanswered, leaving the audience to wonder, AR-AR-AR-AR SEALS CLEAR?!",1503619200,,446,5.109589041095891
