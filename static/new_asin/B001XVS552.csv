8347805,5,B001XVS552,"If you like Les Stroud's Survivorman Series then you will enjoy this DVD.  There are two 45 minute episodes of the Boreal Forest, one in summer and one in winter.  He only took two cameras with him and the production values aren't as slick.  The camera shakes a bit too much at times.  The format of these shows are very similar to the Survivorman series.  He wasn't as skilled or experienced in these episodes.  It takes him 10+ hours to make a fire!  Survivorman fans don't hesitate to buy.  I got mine via Les Stroud's website.",1307318400,6,530,4.447916666666667
