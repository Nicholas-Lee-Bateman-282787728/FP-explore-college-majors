Our movie focuses around a couple, Mike & Naomi. They hire the work of a surrogate mother to have a child for them. They have picked Jenny as their surrogate mother. But unknown to them, Jenny has had such a childhood, her mind is all screwed up.

So Jenny starts killing of friends and family of Mike & Naomi, they then reveal some horrifying secrets about Jenny's childhood, and her relevance with Mike & Naomi as kids...

Not too much of a plot to tell, its an average movie. Suprising to see Bridgette Wilson in a small, unknown film like this. It has some good blood and some gore in it. Apparently this movie goes under several names, we have Sweet Evil, Surrogate Mother, and and Final Vandetta. Its a prety cool horror flick, but its just the same as your average B movie.

I give Sweet Evil a 3/5",1281052800,,1027,4.361256544502618

At a young age her parents died and we also learn she was abused by her foster parents. She becomes the Surrogate Mother to Mike and Naomi. My inital feeling was she just wanted the baby but it turns out something else is driving her to be Evil, perhaps it was a past dealing with Mike or Naomi?",977097600,3,386,4.301369863013699
