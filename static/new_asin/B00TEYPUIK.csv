7005863,5,B00TEYPUIK,"I remember as a kid when one season of Scooby-Doo ended and all summer ads ran, saying Scooby was going to have someone new join the gang! I was so excited to find out who this could be and when it came on Saturday morning that fall, and that box fell from the train, and I heard "" Uncle Scooby? Hi, it`s me, Scrappy Doo"" I was so excited to see the new shows! I collect all the DVDs involving Scooby and the gang. I just like the scary feel of the cartoons and the funny bits that happen! It`s a classic for sure! Can't wait to get this set, and find out when the others will be released!",1431043200,4,589,3.957983193277311
7005864,5,B00TEYPUIK,"It has been decades since I have seen most of the cartoons in this set, if I saw them at all. This is a treasure trove of effectively new to me Scooby Doo cartoons. And even though these cartoons do feature Scrappy Doo, there is not really much difference between these and the 70's and early 80's Scooby Cartoons that preceded them.

There are a few surprising pop culture references in these episodes. Shaggy mentions Star Wars in Strange Encounters, and Scrappy name drops Mick Jagger and other in the Neon Phantom.

The final episode of this DVD set/season, The Ransom of Scooby Chief, appears to have been a backdoor pilot for the next incarnation. Fred Daphne and Velma are only at the beginning and end of the episode. Scooby and Shaggy get kidnapped and Scrappy teams up with his old friends, Annie and Duke, to save them. So instead of the much maligned short cartoons that followed featuring Scooby Shaggy and Scrappy, it could have been Scrappy Doo and Friends.

Warner Bros did a good job with this release. The episodes look great.

It has been a long wait to get these. Hopefully we don't have to wait as long to get more.

7005865,4,B00TEYPUIK,"Its been years, but I was waiting and waiting for Scrappy Doo to come out on DVD, not being interested in streaming the show.  This release of Season 1 episodes with Scooby's nephew show Scrappy Doo when he was....well, Scrappy!  Lennie Weinrib provided Scrappy's voice for the first season, and gave him a boastful attitude, quite in contrast to his uncle's cowardly character.  He's a polarizing character for sure...some love him, many hate him, and I fall in the former category.  I think Scrappy brought a different dynamic to the show, and the first season kept all five original characters in the episodes, thus I enjoy these earlier episodes more than the later ones that were three seven-minute episodes in one show, with only Scrappy, Scooby, and Shaggy as mains.

The video quality of this DVD looks good.  I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but the ones I have seen provide a good transfer with no video flicker.  Audio is monophonic, but clear, the infamous laugh-track is still included, and English subtitles are provided.  The subtitles even nicely state which character is speaking the line because its not always obvious with Hanna-Barbera's limited animation in group scenes or off-screen statements.

Any complaints?  Well, the main complaint I have with the DVD is the cover--its hideous!  I found an alternate cover online with older artwork and printed that off and put it in the case instead because I dislike it that much.  Outside of that, the end credit cards on the episodes are not the white Scooby/Scrappy background that go specifically with the show.  They've used the bright orange one that was attached to Laff-a-Lympics episodes, so I suspect some of the people on those pages did not work on Scrappy. See the photos for the differences.  Furthermore, this is a bare bones DVD with no extras, and there have been extras on previous Scooby releases, so it was somewhat disappointing.  This is why it gets 4 out of 5 stars, but I am very happy to have the episodes on DVD at last.

Fans of Scrappy Doo shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up!",1430438400,4,2079,4.814084507042254
7005866,5,B00TEYPUIK,I love scrappy doo he is awesome this is why I love this show. I was sad when I heard they were taking scrappy doo off the cartoons. This is a must buy you will love this Dvd.,1429574400,5,175,3.6315789473684212
7005867,4,B00TEYPUIK,"Scooby Doo scrappy doo appeared on September 22,1979 with the Scarb lives. Sadly scrappy doo gained less popularity. I'm so happy we are finally getting a dvd of the first season of scooby doo scrappy doo in my opinion this is a very underrated show scrappy saved scooby doo in the late 70s to the early 80s without scrappy there would be no scooby doo scrappy is Scooby's savior and the fact Lennie Weinrib plays scrappy which is awesome so I give this DVD a 4/5 not bad Warner bros not bad at all",1428278400,2,498,4.308510638297872
7005868,5,B00TEYPUIK,"So far almost all of the scooby doo shows were released on dvd except the ones with scrappy doo.
 And i'm talking about regular seasons. not tv movies.

 The show was called THE SCOOBY DOO AND SCRAPPY DOO SHOW and in this dvd u get all episodes from that show.

 1) The rest of the ritchie ritch // scooby doo episodes

 2) The scooby and scrappy doo puppy hour

7005878,4,B00TEYPUIK,Since I've been a young kid I loved Scooby-Doo. Years later now being in film school I love taking a look back at the different shows that grew up on. This was one of the many Scooby-Doo shows that I watched. Unfortunately in this series you obviously have to deal with Scrappy-Doo. As young kid I never liked the character and rewatching these episodes I still think that the show would be better off with out him. None the less I don't think that should deter anyone from giving this series a watch. I just hope they release the rest of the seasons on DVD too.,1481328000,,562,4.311320754716981

I felt insulted then, and I'm thankful to Amazon reviews for the chance to say something public in reply now.  All of those 1970's execs that corrupted their existing shows rather than come up with new ones should be ashamed (looking at Ruby and Spears here).  If you're going make a cartoon dog show about a world where ghosts DO exist, don't insult the fans of the old show by changing it so radically, you imply the old show is passe and somehow wrong in comparison.

However, Scrappy tends to get really annoying after a few episodes...
