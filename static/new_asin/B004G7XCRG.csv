8428520,4,B004G7XCRG,Ive worked in Ethiopia with Rick as part of a spine team. After my first trip I saw this on Amazon and was curious. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the people and going to some of the places in the video. It strengthened my memories of it all. He's a guy doing great things and it was and is a great pleasure to be a small part of it.,1394496000,,340,3.736111111111111
8428521,5,B004G7XCRG,"This short documentary is the story of Dr. Rick Hodes. Dr. Hodes is an American who lives in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and works with people, mostly children, who have impossible diseases such as tuberculosis of the spine. It causes their spines to contort and collapse and could cause their death when their lungs are compressed and they can no longer breathe. He makes the impossible--straightening their backs--possible with the help of others who give freely of their time and labor to operate on spines and straighten backs. He also treats children with tumors the likes of which are truly frightening. Inspiring! For more about him, read Marilyn Berger's book ""This is a Soul.""",1393718400,,680,5.0265486725663715

8428523,5,B004G7XCRG,"I loved this book and have passed it on to my former Pastor. I will read it again in the near future. I had heard of Dr. Hodes and supported his work occasionally, but to read this allows me to see a personal glimpse of his character. I will now make every effort to support his work as much as I can. He has truly made a sacrifice but made such a difference in so many lives.",1345680000,2,376,3.896103896103896
