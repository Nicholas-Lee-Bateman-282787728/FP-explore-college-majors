8473150,5,B0039PCIDA,"I knew Roald Dahl had written many stories for the Alfred Hitchcock Presents series and also some children's books and stories so I purchased his Tales of The Unexpected. Let me tell you, this is as good, if not better, than any suspense/horror anthology series I have ever seen. The acting is good, the picture quality is good, the audio is good but most importantly, the stories are GREAT! I watched 4 episodes within a week or so and was hooked right away. Every story has a twist ending and none of the twists are expected (hence the apt title). Some of the stories, particularly Lamb to the Slaughter, really blew me away. I also enjoy Dahl's introductions (in Set 1 and Set 2) in which he gives you a little bit of history of the story and/or its premise. I watch and collect almost every suspense/horror anthology series on dvd (Twilight Zone, Tales From the Darkside, Tales From the Crypt, Thriller, Night Gallery, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Hitchhiker, etc., etc.) and Tales From the Unexpected is at the very top of that list (along with Night Gallery). I still have 3 more Sets to go and I can not wait to watch these episodes. I highly recommend it. It must be a British thing as I really love Brian Clemens' Thriller horror series from the 1970's as well. They really seem to treat their horror and suspense with class and respect and do it right.",1315094400,,1360,4.555102040816327
