2792083,5,B000O76ZO4,"""Grey Matters"" is a 40's style ""coming out"" movie. Heather Graham channels Cary Grant and is adorable doing it. The movie isn't very believable, but that is part of the humor. The dialog is quick, so you have to listen carefully or you will miss the jokes.

Although I gave this movie a perfect ""10,"" it is conditional. Take off two points if you do not absolutely love Heather Graham. Take off two points if you do not like 40's screwball comedies. Take off two more points if you think that Heather Graham being gay is offensive rather than hilarious.

""Grey Matters"" is my second favorite Heather Graham movie behind ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" This is a ""must see"" for all her fans.",1184284800,6,684,4.508064516129032
2792084,2,B000O76ZO4,The dialogue in this movie sucks. It is either not funny or extremely cliche. It could have turned out so much better with the general plot of the movie but it was a huge turndown for me.,1183852800,3,187,4.081081081081081
2792085,5,B000O76ZO4,"Great is all I can say. I have been so bored with every romantic comedy that has come out in the past five years. Finally a movie with heart, soul and originality. The cast is superb, the writing is fantastic and it's a great postcard of New York City. I laughed and I even shed a tear or two! This should have been the comedy of the year. I highly reccomend it. Molly Shannon is also hilarious--some of her funniest acting yet.",1182902400,9,428,4.2317073170731705
2792086,1,B000O76ZO4,"Just got done watching the movie and I must say, as a romantic comedy buff this movie had me shouting at it for all the missed opportunities to make the story great. At first hearing that Heather Grahams character was ""coming out of the closet"" I imagined that it was going to be written as some hilarious temporary crisis over the changing circumstance with her and her brothers extremely close relationship.

Nope, they took the comedy from that, and instead turned it into some very, very overdue realization that she actually was gay, this is not obvious until the last few minutes of the movie.

But not in a clever storyline.

She meets a very nice and funny scottish guy who is crazy about her, and the movie spends all this time developing his character to make the viewer support him. They might have thought that this was a brilliant diversion but the effort is doomed to a disappointing end that made us wonder why they even included the nice scottish guy and then through him out of the movie like dirty bath water while hoping that we will cheer for the main character jumping for overly ecstatic joy just for having an unconvincing and lackluster 1 minute conversation with a lesbian at an unwelcoming gay-bar. Forget about the nice scottish guy that always tries to cheer her up and will go so far as to dress up like a woman to keep her company. I personally believe a better ending would have been to continue the uncomfortable lesbian-bar moment with a follow up scene at an apartment where she realizes she's not into it and then runs to the scottish guy so both brother and sister ends up with great people. Its not that I'm homophobic, its just the story as it was told didn't add up.",1182556800,7,1705,4.529220779220779
2792087,5,B000O76ZO4,"This sleeper should have been awakened when it hit the theatres.  Probably due to the premise of the film (one of our characters may be a lesbian... shhhh, don't say that too loudly).  This movie is a wonderful little gem that could and does cross over and should play equally well to the male or female heterosexual or homosexual.  It simply deals with the emotion all of us can relate to: love.  And although it affects us in ways we don't always expect... we generally learn more about ourselves because of it.  If you want to reflect on your past loves, or simply be entertained in a light and uplifting way... check out GRAY MATTERS... because she does!",1182470400,8,658,4.5423728813559325

2792198,4,B000O76ZO4,It's hard to figure out what love is all about. Harder to fall in love with the same person as your best friend and/or sibling. It's a movie with coming to terms of one's sexuality. It's funny and romantic.,1358467200,,206,4.3076923076923075

2792200,2,B000O76ZO4,"I'm so sorry to say that this film is a dud.  Yes, I was lured to purchase it based on the cast list; two lovely Hollywood actors (Graham / Moynahan), two capable male actors as well (Cavanagh / Cumming), and of course Spacek is (can be) a powerhouse actor.  So what happened?!

Each of these actors has carried more believable, more enjoyable roles in other films.  I suspect that they were under poor direction.

The screenplay had a decent message.  Character development was satisfactory.  Sets and scenes were largely agreeable.  But there were grossly awkward moments everywhere; with several scenes that felt more like line-recital that true acting.  Some outwardly implausible blocking.  Even the much-publicized, plot-pivotal scene between Moynahan and Graham was uniquely disappointing, because it came across as childishly-contrived and poorly-timed; bad enough that I was inwardly embarrassed just watching it.

Yes, there were fun moments too.  Many of the light and fluffy scenes were palatable, some even amusing.  Sadly though, on the whole, the flaws in the film are overwhelming.  I ultimately discarded the DVD.  C'est la vie.",1319155200,,1145,5.283333333333333
2792221,5,B000O76ZO4,This is not a porno or skin flick which I usually enjoy viewing.  This movie is entertaining because it deals with a woman that has a problem with relationships as well as her sexualality. Something that happens in many women lives today.  So it is a great movie for couples that are uninhibited.,1313452800,,296,4.566037735849057
2792222,5,B000O76ZO4,"Yes the film is cheesy; yes it's definitely a chic flick and yes its easy watching. Discovering you are gay is one thing, doing this with your brother's wife to be, is another thing. This is a courageous movie of a women who struggles to come to terms with her sexuality. The movie will surprise you with humour from beginning to end. As the saying goes ""three is a crowd",1299974400,,371,4.314285714285714

2792225,5,B000O76ZO4,"Excellent movie with good performances from two of Hollywoods most beautiful and talented actresses, Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan. A funny lighthearted romantic film.",1275955200,3,173,6.25
2792226,5,B000O76ZO4,"I watch how I spend my 'pink' dollar, but felt the DVD purchase of this was a worthwhile investment. I can definitely watch it over again and still be entertained. I feel I must add I do also enjoy movies from the 1940s and grew up watching the wonderful musicals from the period. Whoever did the dancing for the stars in this movie were very good and certainly added to its appeal. The story is fine, it really is just a romantic comedy (chick flick) with a lesbian twist. If you are interested in GLBT movies and don't expect the next great lesbian classic here, you should be entertained.

I have not been aware of Heather Graham in movies prior to this, however I was impressed. I do like Tom Cavanagh and Alan Cumming although I would not be surprised if some of the latter's role was cut from this film (if not, it should have been expanded). Bridget Moynahan was like Sandra Bullock in many ways, it really made me look twice. Was this deliberate? I will be interested in how her career develops. Rachel Shelley did not have to do much, however I would loved to have seen her character be feistier with the advertising execs. The elevator scene with Gray and Sam included some wonderful dialogue. I did love the 'gay puberty' line. Sissy Spacek as Sydney was interesting.

Overall the movie is a fun watch for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies regardless of their sexuality. The ending might not be to everyone's liking, but I enjoyed the Marlo Thomas (That Girl) touch. What has the writer/director been doing since this? More to come from her I hope.",1274659200,6,1561,4.551601423487544
2792227,5,B000O76ZO4,"I didn't know what to expect at first because the reviews for this film were all over the place but let me just say this film is awesome. There are so many things about it that make it exceptional and a must see. It's hilarious, the characters are charming and enthralling and the way they handled the subject of coming out was in my opinion great. Add to that a phenomenal sibling relationship and you can easily see why this film is a winner. What's not to love about all that?",1243900800,3,479,4.274725274725275
2792228,5,B000O76ZO4,"This movie is hilarious!  I can watch it over and over again.  If I feel like I need a laugh, I watch it!  It has great acting and the writers did a great job with the script, it is unpredictable and witty.  I highly recommend this movie.  And the actors are top notch!",1237334400,3,269,4.0
2792229,1,B000O76ZO4,"I hate to do this to Alan Cumming because he's a great actor and he is, like always great in his character for this movie. But his acting alone could not carry this movie. The characters in this film are completely flat. Watching this movie you keep waiting for it to actually /start/. For the acting to begin, for you to actually start caring what's going on. For SOMETHING! But it never does. Instead you get a whole movie over acted angst. And then in the last 10 minutes are so, something worthwhile happens and then the movie is over.

Honestly, if you're dead set on watching this movie rent it. Other wise, you'll hate yourself when at the end of the movie your one thought is... ""Rachel Shelly is gorgeous.""",1222387200,,715,4.458015267175573
2792230,3,B000O76ZO4,This movie was OK. I would say if you can rent it do that but it is not worth a purchase. Just another disfunctional relationship but only between a brother and sister and they end up falling in love with the same woman.,1215388800,,220,4.1395348837209305
2792271,4,B000O76ZO4,"This is a great, fun movie that is a romantic comedy in the genre of those 1940's gems some of us are old enough to remember.

True to life?  Not much.  But it is just light hearted and fun with some cute dance routines.  The actors are all good in their roles and sure it would have been nice to have Gray experience a little more romance for us all to ogle, but it was sweet and unreal and smile worthy.

Nothing earth shattering, nothing overly dramatic, just a good fun time.

Enjoy it.  I did and I do.  Bought it and have fun watching it anytime I want something just fun.",1207526400,3,578,4.098214285714286
2792272,2,B000O76ZO4,Left the film with a great deal of disappointment. The story had potentialities but the director only just touched the surface of a very interesting topic and dilemma indeed. And why the lesbian stereotypes in the bar? As if what all homosexuals want is a quick sexual fix!? Also very bad editing of sound!,1204761600,2,306,4.685185185185185
2792273,4,B000O76ZO4,"I've watched this movie quite a few times now and have enjoyed it each time. It's a light-hearted comedy with very likeable actors. I'm not sure why there have been negative reviews unless someone is going into watching this with the idea that it's going to be a deep, complicated movie. Sometimes it's nice just to watch something for the sake of relaxing and laughing.
 I definately recommend it.",1201219200,3,398,4.768115942028985
2792274,3,B000O76ZO4,"It's a fairy good romantic comedy, features lesbian character. Nice characters, great acting, decent plot, but the end doesn't really solve the matter in my opinion. Good for a night watch, but that's about it, it doesn't have what it take to be a great romantic comedy or a great lesbian movies.
Make up your mind when buying the DVD, but it's pretty cheap so I guess that's okay to have one copy for your collection.",1199491200,2,418,4.5131578947368425
2792275,4,B000O76ZO4,"and you'll like it just fine.  A few scenes at the beginning are completely far-fetched and impossible to believe and i think that is what throws it for most people. The last scene in the elevator is a little too preachy - though too true. I liked it because it reminded me of my own shock and confusion and horror at realizing I was gay - which eventually gave way to love, self-acceptance and happiness. It takes time and everyone reacts differently. I thought Gray's reaction was pretty spot-on. Especially when she looked at the girl passing the hot-dog vendor. So - if you can forgive the beginning a little, you'll probably like it...",1198281600,,640,4.614035087719298
2792276,4,B000O76ZO4,"This movie was fun, and refreshing because it was not an upchucking of dismal lesbian social commentary or the ' happily ever after isn't part of the lesbian culture' message being sold by cynical women directors seeking like and kind in their audiences.

Instead, it's refreshingly light but only just as believable as any hetero mainstream romantic comedy and thus it doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.  The lesbians are no more realistic than Julia Roberts was as a hooker in Pretty Woman, meaning you'll believe them only if you want to believe them.

Understanding what a romantic comedy is, we dove in with very little reservation and popcorned our way through to an ending that came after some surprising lifestyle insights in a ""I wish my family had said that"" kind of speech.

After watching this movie the first time, we showed it to a number of our straight friends and they enjoyed it too. There is a message in that.  Drop the 'our lot in life' attitude and this movie is truly a romp.  Bottom line?  It delivers if you let it. If we had more lesbian romantic comedies, I think I'd have rated this one a three.  But absence makes the heart...  so I gave it a four.

Side note: The retro dance numbers (especially Heather Graham's) were impressive. The appearance of the actress who plays Helena Peabody in the L Word was a treat.  While this movie will hold less appeal to women who growl at the color pink, it's also a decent date movie for our community.

2792277,1,B000O76ZO4,"You'd have to pry open a lot of Hollywood projection room closets to find a movie worse than Gray Matters.  This vacuous confection, which has all the nutritional value of bubble gum - and is almost as pink - skates adorably across the surface of two dark and interesting themes, both of which are treated as seriously as a Britney Spears song might treat the later works of J.P. Sartre.  These topics are, in order of appearance, 1.) a brother/sister relationship so pathologically close it borders on incestuous (see Nabokov)  2.) the emotional strain of coming out as a lesbian.  The film attempts to be a comedy - and complex, difficult subjects like these are often the grist for penetrating comedies - but Gray Matters will have none of that.  Gray Matters wants you to find it so charming that the only thought going through your mind is how to pinch its little cheek.

The picture stars Heather Graham as Gray, which is a huge head start.  Graham exudes clueless charm, innocence, sincerity, and adorable determination, in addition to being a real beauty.  She labors valiantly for this movie, but there's just too much working against her.  Thomas Cavanagh, as her brother Sam, is staggeringly awful.  (That rapid fire delivery of his, recycled from Scrubs, is truly annoying - is that all he's got?)  Worse still is Bridget Moynahan who seems to believe that being built like a Victoria's Secret model is the same thing as acting - there are scenes where her derriere threatens to walk off with the picture.

When second fiddles and even bit players outshine the principals, you know you've got trouble.  Mollie Shannon, as Gray's colleague is a hoot, Sissy Spacek as Gray's unconventional shrink is splendid, Alan Cumming as cabbie turned suitor is wonderful - even walk-on contributors like the wedding dress lady and the Vegas minister offer welcome relief - all because they offer distraction from the slow motion train wreck taking place.  I can't imagine anyone who has ""come out"" not being offended by the sheer superficiality and stupidity of this vehicle.

With some disasters it's hard to affix blame, here it's easy.  Sue Kramer wrote and directed this 90 minute Banana Republic spread.  Even with devolution in full swing and audiences getting dimmer and more superficial by the minute, it's hard to imagine anyone, anywhere thinking this movie was worthwhile.",1191715200,6,2382,4.9298245614035086

The idea had potential and the cast is good, but the story reels from one fake and ridiculous setup to the next. Do yourself a favor and see ""Imagine Me & You"" instead.",1188345600,6,445,4.426829268292683

While watching ""Gray Matters"" - which marks the filmmaking debut of writer/director Sue Kramer - I kept wondering if maybe I hadn't somehow stumbled back into ""Puccini for Beginners,"" a movie I'd seen a few weeks earlier, since both are oddly similar, equally implausible tales of Manhattan yuppies involved in romantic triangles of the bisexual kind.

Gray and Sam are siblings who not only live in the same apartment and spend most of their free time together but are so emotionally attached to one another that people often mistake them for a romantic couple.  As if that weren't queasy enough, the screenplay ups the ante by having the hitherto heterosexual Gray suddenly ""discover"" she's a lesbian when she falls for Sam's gorgeous new wife, Charlie (yes, I know all this can be a bit confusing, but Charlie is a woman).

As with ""Puccini,"" most of what happens in ""Gray Matters"" feels contrived and artificial.  We don't believe for a second that two seemingly rational people like Sam and Charlie would become engaged after only a single date, or that even an indecisive ditz like Gray would be this in-the-dark about her own sexuality.

Thus, with so little of the storyline grounded in anything even closely resembling reality, we find ourselves detached from the characters and indifferent to their fates.  That's no denigration of the lead players - Heather Graham, Thomas Cavanaugh and Bridget Monahan - all of whom are appealing and likable in their various roles.  And there are some sharp supporting performances by Molly Shannon, Alan Cumming, and Sissy Spacek as Gray's loopy therapist (though there is a brief cameo appearance by singer Gloria Gaynor that is pure unadulterated pandering).  Moreover, New York City looks all sparkly and shiny as seen through the lens of cinematographer John S. Bartley's camera.

With its countless references to 40's musicals and romantic comedies, ""Gray Matters"" clearly sees itself as both an homage and a throwback to the metier and style of those earlier films.  But we are obviously living in different times, and the labored setups and screwball comedy devices that worked so well in the past feel pretty darned anachronistic and forced when employed today.  My feeling is that if you`re going to make a modern romantic comedy, one that deals with such ""contemporary"" issues as coming out and sexual identity, then make a movie that actually feels modern.  Don`t try to tuck it safely away in the past, then expect us to take any of it seriously.  Despite its taking on those relatively gutsy issues, ""Gray Matters"" really doesn't exist in anyone's world, and certainly not in the racially and economically diverse world of 21st Century Manhattan.

""Gray Matters"" presents us with life as only those in the movies ever live it.",1187913600,8,2793,5.002159827213823
