7864238,3,6304197314,"Director Leo McCarey's cross-country farce has plenty of talent but sporadic laughs. Unfortunately, Burns and Allen make irritating travel companions for Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland, which spoils some of the fun. W.C. Fields saves the day with his classic pool routine  easily the film's highlight.",1401494400,,302,5.565217391304348
7864239,4,6304197314,"In a ""Biography In Sound"" profile on W.C. Fields done in the 1950s over NBC Radio ""Six of a Kind"" director Leo McCarey relates the tale of how Fields objected to his character arriving so late in the film. It is worth the wait, especially when Fields says the following to Allison Skipworth: ""According to you, everything I like to do is either illegal, immoral or fattening!"" It was in fact an adlib that McCarey got the right (paying with a case of whiskey) to use in a movie with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. What Fields never said was that he stole the line from critic Alexander Woolcott, a fact that movie critics revealed to McCarey much to the director's chagrin. A nice part of ""Six of a Kind"" that it includes a nicer variation of the usual relationship that made up the Charlie Ruggles/Mary Boland pairing (they teamed for about six films altogether). You end up rooting for them especially when kept apart by Burns and Allen and their giant dog.",1369612800,,959,4.5491329479768785
7864240,5,6304197314,We were very glad to get a copy of this very old video. (Had a copy before but it was lost)It isw good for a lot of laughs...especially the scene of W.C. Fields playing pool,1302134400,,173,3.9714285714285715
7864241,4,6304197314,"Note: Because there is a twin-pack that offers both the 1934 W.C. Fields film ""Six of a Kind"" and his classic 1940 film ""The Bank Dick,"" the reviews for those two movies, both together and individually, are all cross-referenced.  However, this is just a review of ""Six of a Kind,"" the lesser known of the two Fields films.
Directed by Leo McCarey, ""Six of a Kind"" finds J. Pinkham Whinney (Charlie Ruggles) and his wife Flora (Mary Boland), planning a second honeymoon in Hollywood, California.  They advertise for a couple to share expenses on the trip and end up with not only George Edward (George Burns) and Gracie DeVore (Gracie Allen), but their gigantic Great Dane.  Meanwhile, Ferguson (Bradley Page), one of the other clerks at the bank where Whinney works has put $50,000 into the unsuspecting man's suitcase intending to rob him the first night on the road.  Of course, Gracie makes the group go a different way and it takes a while for Ferguson and his gal Trixie (Grace Bradley) to catch up.
The resolution involves the sheriff of a Nevada town, John Hoxley (W.C. Fields) and innkeeper, Mrs. Rumford (Alison Skipworth), and the hilarious arrest sequence top off this above average comedy.  Fields and Skipworth had been paired together successful in several previous films, including ""Tillie and Gus"" and while they work well together as the last pair making up the ""Six"" of the title.  The other scene that really stands out is when Fields plays another one of his famous billiard games where the cue is a tad warped.  Ruggles and Boland are supposedly the ""stars"" of the film, but of course the comedy team of Burns & Allen upstage them: when they first meet, Mrs. Whinney thinks the couple are interior decorators because Gracie is changing everything in their living room.  As an example of the ""road comedy"" pictures of this period, of which ""It Happened One Night"" is obviously the best, ""Six of a Kind"" makes fun of the new fangled idea of taking a vacation that is mainly traveling in a car for a really long period of time.  I do not think this is a great W.C. Fields film, but it is certainly above average and having Burns & Allen involved is not exactly a bad thing either.",1017446400,5,2198,4.6735751295336785
7864242,4,6304197314,"Ruggles and Boland, as J. Pinkham and Florence Whiney, are about to depart on a cross-country second honeymoon to Hollywood, for which they make the mistake of advertising for a companion couple........The idea of putting no fewer than six seasoned comedy actors into one movie was an inspired one for Paramount. Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland were already a popular co-starring duo at that studio; the hilarious radio team of straight-man George Burns and scatterbrained Gracie Allen were also giving films a try; Alison Skipworth was a formidible character actress for both comedy and drama, and Fields, with his nasal, descending-scale line readings, was a unique comedy attraction with a large, specialised following. Leo McCarey, their director on this occasion, had just survived one the the Marx Bros. most fondly remembered vehicles: DUCK SOUP. Wild gags, both visual and verbal abound in SIX OF A KIND with each of the aforementioned six performing their specialties in a Walter DeLeon-Harry Ruskin script that appropriately sets the scene for uninhibited farce. A short (65 minutes) episodic film, the movie isn't quite the comedy classic it might have been, but there are classic scenes such as that giant hound growling in the back seat ; there's a tree which saves both Ruggles and Boland from a fall of a cliff..............A wee bit too much of Gracie Allen at her most annoyingly obnoxious makes one wish that the writers could have distributed the balance of scenes with a bit more equality among its stars.",998438400,5,1525,5.104

7864244,4,6304197314,"So, it is only 70 minutes long, but it is just the correct Paramount  length for its comedies in the '30s.  Fields steals the show as  ""Honest John"", hilarious in the pool room routine, one of his old  vaudeville specialties.  George and Gracie are a bit overbearing as the  unmarried riders in Charlie Ruggles' and Mary Boland's second honeymoon  trip, and a subplot of missing loot.  Put it all together and you have a  nice little package, not everyone's best film, but a keeper all the same.  Now if Paramount/Universal would release the rest of Bill Fields'  output--but that is another story.",965260800,11,598,4.764705882352941
