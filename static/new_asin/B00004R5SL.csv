7920608,2,B00004R5SL,"The living Edens series just happens to be a product of the time shortly before the DVD format. It shows how far we have come in such a short time. At any rate, Faye Dunaway's narration was stellar with a type of professionalism of a college speech and english professor. She tells Thailand's story with keen inflexion and sophisticated integrity. The problem with this Living Edens is ""like the rest"" a brief time to explain and cover huge territories and as a result the series is forced to concentrate on the familiar or cliche'd aspects of a given biome or region. With that said we end up missing a great deal of what the area/s has to offer.

In reflecting it was a nice documentary among the best of the Living Edens series but nothing of anything really special by todays standards.",1330732800,,790,4.563380281690141
