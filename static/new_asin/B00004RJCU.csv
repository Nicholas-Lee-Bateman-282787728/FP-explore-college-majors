7921389,5,B00004RJCU,"This movie was very cute with some very funny bits of action, and dialogue as well.  There should have been a sequel!!!",1366416000,,119,4.409090909090909
7921390,3,B00004RJCU,"An uncomplicated story and movie that never-the-less contains clever dialogue and acting that is well executed by the cast. This is a perfect movie for a family pajama Sunday morning. Sophie Lorain is warm, captivating and beautiful to look at in every scene she appears in. Steve Guttenberg is funny and his performance provides a good question as to why he has dropped of the face of the movie map.  For the casual entertainment aspects of the story and the charm of the actors I liked it and recommend it.",1047081600,2,508,4.644444444444445
