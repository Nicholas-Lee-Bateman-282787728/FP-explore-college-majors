2240610,2,B0007TJAQE,"I was expecting this DVD to challenge me with yoga postures and a relaxation/meditation geared to weight loss. Each posture is held for only a very short time and many are modified in such a way that I felt no challenge at all (and I am fairly new to yoga).

Strangely, the routine is broken up with blank screens between every posture which tell the benefits of each posture.  This feature would have been better placed on an extra track for one-time review.  It left you standing there for an extended period waiting for the next posture.  And there was only one new posture that I had not seen in other yoga DVDs.

The ""weight-loss meditation"" at the end was only 5 minutes long and not much different from the relaxation poses at the end of other routines.

On the positive side, the breathwork is explained well enough that I have recommended this routine to my mother, but I probably won't be using it again.",1126483200,9,914,4.509090909090909
2240611,3,B0007TJAQE,"Perhaps if I had used this more than once in my week's rental, I would've enjoyed it more and been more impressed. The fact that I wasn't inspired to engage it more than the initial time speaks volumes to me.",1362355200,,208,4.225
2240612,2,B0007TJAQE,I didn't feel any stress relief from doing this video! I was expecting some good stretching and calming poses but there just weren't any. Not worth even the $1.99 rental fee :(,1361750400,,176,4.53125
2240613,5,B0007TJAQE,"Beginner's Dynamic Yoga for Stress Relief and Weight Loss by Suzanne Andrews is a great DVD for any beginning exerciser, no matter the age. It offers easy to follow instructions and Suzanne herself is a very enthusiastic teacher who obviously loves the topic. The poses offered in the DVD are simple and Suzanne makes yoga accessible to those who might think yoga is only for people who can get on the floor or do complicated poses right from the start. None of the poses in this particular DVD require floor work at all.

The poses themselves are easily modifiable for any beginner to yoga who wants to make the program a little harder or a little easier, depending on the day. The neck stretches towards the end and the sea turtle are especially relaxing poses.

Suzanne offers plenty of reminders to breathe which is something most beginners forget easily so this is a nice touch. Reasons for each pose are given before the pose is done, but not in a bothersome way that would become tedious over time. They are gentle reminders as to why we do yoga besides the obvious, ""it feels good!""

The meditation at the end is longer than usually seen in other yoga DVD but it focuses on the power of positive thinking and really becoming relaxed, which is the purpose of relaxation at the end of yoga. Many yoga DVD's just gloss over this very important part of an active yoga practice but as this particular DVD is about stress relief, it is nice to see this focus.

Overall, this is a very good DVD for any beginner! It is one you'll keep coming back to time and again whether for weight loss workouts or stress relief.",1361145600,2,1616,4.523972602739726
2240614,5,B0007TJAQE,"I just watched this beginner's yoga video and did it with my 10 year old daughter.  We both loved it.  The directions were very clear, making it easy to follow for people, like me, who are just getting started in yoga.  Even though I'm overweight I found the entire routine manageable.  I felt so good after completing the entire routine.  I did most of the meditation portion, at the end, lying down.  It was very relaxing!! I look forward to watching it again and again, so I can get good at the ""chair"" poses and do them at work.  I will also look forward to some more advanced videos as I progress.  Thanks for making a great video.",1360454400,,636,4.330508474576271
2240615,5,B0007TJAQE,"This is a terrific beginner yoga video for those over 40.  The background music and ocean scenery are very relaxing.  I will incorporate these poses into my early morning workout to increase flexibility.  The instructor does an excellent job.  There are yoga poses for all level of fitness including a section using a chair. The chair poses are about 19-20 minutes into the video.  If you have a kindle fire or a computer at work, this is a great video to utilize at work for tension and stress relief.  The last 8 minutes of the video is on meditation including instruction on health and well-being.  I recommend doing the last 8 minutes of meditation daily to not only help in losing weight but also for health and well-being.  I recommend this video for those who want to improve their fitness and flexibility.",1360454400,,813,4.676056338028169
2240616,5,B0007TJAQE,"Who else wants to feel energized and motivated? This beginner's yoga video is the perfect solution for people who are restricted in their movements, chair bound, or need a pain-free way to get moving again. The host understands how difficult those first steps can be and that people who are active reduce eating out of stress.

The video consists of 40 minutes of yoga organized into standing and seated series. Accommodations are given for people who need help balancing or require gentle movements due to arthritis.

One of the best features is the T.A.K.E.C.H.A.R.G.E. philosophy, encouraging you to tone your body, accelerate metabolism, energize yourself, and reduce stress. At the end, a unique positive-thinking meditation helps you imagine yourself at your potential and weight loss. I keep reading how a calm, positive mind affects our immune systems. I really did feel de-stressed, relaxed, and at one with Nature after doing the practice.

If you have a mobile device, you could use parts of the video when you are traveling and trapped in a seated position for too long or stuck in an airport. I also think my students could benefit from yoga breaks at their desks.

I'd recommend this video to anyone who feels trapped due to their immobility, be it due to their size, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, or inability to lose weight.",1359763200,,1347,5.026905829596412
2240617,5,B0007TJAQE,"I found this beginning yoga workout to be great. I have wanted to incorporate yoga into my routine for years because of the promoted health benefits but most other programs, even ""beginners"" ones, were too hard to follow, the transitions were difficult and since I'd never done yoga before I didn't have the balance or flexibility to do most of the poses.

I was able to follow along with every pose in this video with no trouble, even with mild arthritis in my back and hips. I found the setting to be highly relaxing and the instructor to be very encouraging. I could actually see doing this workout again and again. The poses offered a great stretch that made me feel more flexible and eased my joint pain and stiffness and the breathing exercises recharged me so I actually feel energized and alert after doing the program.

I love that this program allows me to experience all the health benefits of yoga - improved breathing, relaxation, stress-relief, strength, and flexibility, while not being too difficult for my level of activity. In regards to the reviews that said it was too easy or annoying, it is clearly stated that it is a beginners yoga program targeted for those over forty and/or overweight. If you are an experienced yogi or looking for a fast-paced, intense workout, it's obviously not for you.

If you do want something relaxing, engaging, reaffirming, and recharging that you can do every day, then I would definitely recommend this program. It is perfect for those of us who need the health benefits of yoga but have health or weight challenges keeping us from more complicated programs.",1358208000,21,1613,4.794964028776978
2240618,5,B0007TJAQE,Finally a beginners Yoga DVD that I can actually do. This is a great start for older (over 50) beginners who are not very flexible and just want a beginners yoga program to get started. I have arthritis and can't exercise on the floor and need more time than most to go from one pose to another and this one gives me the benefit of both. I was feeling a little depressed when I started but after doing the program I felt much better.,1358208000,2,433,4.166666666666667
2240619,2,B0007TJAQE,"The instructor is irritating. She will be in the middle of a move, your body in a squat and you hands in the air and then it just changes scene to another move. Never tells you to release, no transition, it's odd.  There were even a couple where she didn't do the other side... It was so frustrating I had to stop. Try something else.",1354752000,,334,4.138461538461539
2240620,5,B0007TJAQE,Needed the right video to get me started back into yoga after many years.  This was perfect. Gentle approach good descriptions of the moves and nicely done.  Felt nicely stretched afterward and more energy for the day.  I will use this regularly.,1348531200,7,246,4.809523809523809
2240621,2,B0007TJAQE,"First I have to state that the video quality is very poor for this video, compared to others I've rented from Amazon.  Every scene was pixelated, which was distracting.  Not the video's fault, Amazon should have encoded it better.

Secondly, the music mix was WAY TOO HIGH.  I found it difficult to follow the instructor at times.  The music itself was jarring at times instead of soothing, and had a ""cheesy"" quality to it.

Thirdly, the instructor was a little too ... child-like at times.  I felt like she was giving lessons to five-year-olds instead of adults.

The routine, as other have stated, is VERY basic.  There are three standing balance poses but that's as challenging as it gets.  I'm overweight but have been working out a lot and found this too easy for my fitness and activity level.  The reason I tried it was because I've found other ""beginner"" yoga videos too challenging... with my extra weight (bulk) I simply couldn't get into many of the poses.

If you are fairly sedentary, overweight, and/or inactive, this would be a great first introduction to some basic yoga and stretching.  As for me, I'll keep looking.",1342310400,5,1134,4.753846153846154
2240622,5,B0007TJAQE,"I love this DVD and it seems like something that I could easily do 3 times a week and stick with. No, it is not a high impact or cardio workout, but it is not meant to be. The thing with yoga is that you can improve even the simplest pose each time you do it. This is great for beginners but also a very nice stretching workout for more advanced people.
Also, being over fifty, moving everyday is so important. I find that when I do this I don't feel as achey. The music, scenery, and the instructor are all really fabulous and work well together. Very happy with this purchase. I've bought other Dvds that were very challenging...did them a few times and then stopped. I feel like this is something very healthy and easy to do everyday. I also like the meditation at the end with affirmations for losing weight. Great job!",1321660800,11,823,4.316129032258065
2240623,3,B0007TJAQE,"Definitely for beginners. If you have had any introduction to yoga, you will likely find this too easy. That being said, it is relaxing. Very low impact. If you are typically fairly active you will likely find this too short (you may want to do some of the poses several times to feel like you are getting more of a work-out). If you are just starting a work-out program, rehabing, or purely want something for stress relief, than you will probably like this.",1258416000,13,459,4.542168674698795
2240624,5,B0007TJAQE,"Thank you all for your comments as I do appreciate them:-) I am the licensed Occupational Therapy Practitioner who made this tape with a sincere desire to help a very special population. Over the years I've had the pleasure of helping 1000's of people recover from debilatating injuries and illness and noticed that not all people can perform the exercises on other DVD's and so I set out to produce one.  This DVD is for you if you are:

1.  Slow moving due to stiffness from arthritis and / or a senior
2.  20% or more overweight and eat when stressed
3.  Have fibromyalgia
4.  Live with chronic fatique syndrome

We have another DVD out now (soon available on Amazon) that is more challenging and a TV series on the way.  I look forward to helping you achieve your health and fitness goals:-)

2240625,5,B0007TJAQE,I am a beginner that has a tweaked back and I got this as well as a few other DVDs and I enjoyed this one. I'd mix it into my practice.,1172102400,3,135,3.3870967741935485
2240626,2,B0007TJAQE,"This was my first Yoga DVD purchase.  Being a beginner, the stretching exercises are great but the quality of the product and the too sappy, sweetness of the instructor, I had a hard time getting into a routine.  It was hard to focus.",1171152000,,234,4.4186046511627906
2240627,5,B0007TJAQE,"The scenery on the beach is so beautiful and the music is so relaxing that I would buy this tape just for that.  But the benefits of doing these exercises are terrific.  I'm 56 and have tried yoga before, but none of the programs were explained as well as this one.  I stand on my feet all day long and they ache at the end of the day.  The seated exercises and the neck exercises were a welcome addition.  The breathing exercises are explained exceptionally well and decrease the appetite.",1154563200,5,490,4.4
2240628,5,B0007TJAQE,"I highly recommend this DVD to complement any weight management/weight loss program.  It offers the missing link of motivating your mind, body, spirit to eat healthy and mindfully.  I am a registered dietician for a hospital and the participants in our weight management plan love it!  If you are overweight, the exercises in this DVD are modified so that anyone can do them.  The breathing is also explained exceptionally well and really helps get rid of stress.",1136246400,12,463,4.974025974025974

I have a bad back and am over 40 and the other DVD's were to hard and complicated. With this special DVD I have lost ten pounds!!I feel relaxed and sleep better at night!! Suzanne Andrews is the best teacher she knows how to explain what to do and when to do it. I use this work out DVD four times a week. I think it's special because I have tried others and nothing compares to this one!

2240630,5,B0007TJAQE,"Wow! A DVD that even I, a not so flexible older adult can do.  This DVD does not require you to sit down on the floor and is excellent for people who have difficulty getting up. The poses are modifed so that a real beginner can do them and gives you plenty of time to get into the next pose.  I'm not that great at balance, but this DVD  doesnt' even require you to have great balance. This DVD takes the mystery out of yoga and really explains each step with beautifully illustrated graphics in an easy to understand and uplifting manner.  The 10 minute meditation at the beach is a great stress buster.",1130803200,10,604,4.271929824561403
8051234,2,B0007TJAQE,I am taking private lessons and looked at this video for a few reminders - did not find it at all helpful for a beginner.  Not enough emphasis on breathing techniques.,1454112000,,167,4.387096774193548

8051241,5,B0007TJAQE,"If you want a unique approach to weight loss, get Suzanne Andrews' Beginners Dynamic Yoga for Stress Release and Weight Reduction!  You will not have a hard time doing these exercises as they are not strenuous, yet you will feel both relaxed and invigorated by the end of the forty-five minutes. You will have a new take on your own life as you shed tension through gentle movement.

The focus is on stress reduction.  There are informative diagrams explaining each grouping of exercises as you begin them.  Suzanne talks you through the asanas and their effect on health and vitality. She even offers challenges in the tape, magnificently filmed, that appeal to those who  make the effort: ""Here is the grace that lies ahead for you!""

Proper posture, positive thinking and taming tension to create change; these are the enduring points I carried away with me.  I found the meditation tantalizing, and I see how building this program into my daily routine could easily allow me to give up stress and related comfort eating.",1374192000,,1024,4.850574712643678

difficult on my joints. On the advice of my physician, I decided to try
my hand at yoga. After careful consideration, I ordered Beginners Dynamic Yoga for Stress Release & Weight Loss. Unlike other yoga
programs, this DVD is easy to follow. All of the movements are explained in a clear and precise manner. The beautiful background scenery really keeps me engaged. Unlike other workout DVDs that I have tried, I find
myself looking forward to working out each morning. By using this DVD, I have noticed an increase in my energy. My ability to handle stressful situations has increased my leaps and bounds. Instead of becoming tense, I find myself using the deep breathing techniques that are presented. With the low-impact movements, I do not worry about becoming overheated during these hot summer months. Best of all, my waistline has seen a dramatic decrease.",1374192000,7,931,4.89873417721519
