Most of the shots could be anywhere, not necessarily New England where there are endless vistas of beauty.  I had envisioned it would be similar to the Christmas in New York DVD that is handsomely produced with videos of New York scenes backed by beautifully performed classical music.",1393200000,,424,4.875
7925877,2,B00004X026,"I was very disappointed when I viewed this DVD.

I lived in New England for 42 years and saw alot more beauty than you chose to include.  Yours was repetitive and , well, I was very disappointed!

Sorry!",1286064000,,203,4.2894736842105265
7925878,5,B00004X026,"Okay, here's the deal with this DVD. This is basically two previously released CD's entitled ""New England Christmastide"" and ""New England Christmastide 2"" accompanied by your choice of one of two visuals: (1) a looped video of a burning fire (or yule) log or (2) a number of cutscenes of snow-covered New England countryside or coastline during a gentle snow shower. The 42 songs featured on this DVD are exactly the same as the two aforementioned CD's, and they're in the exact same order as well.  The reason I bought this DVD is that I own and love the New England Christmastide CD's and I wanted to get them on the DVD format. Besides it was nice hearing the carols while seeing the beautiful images of New England in the wintertime; it provided a nice alternative to just popping the CD's into my player and only hearing the music. I consider this DVD as the ""video"" from the New England Christmastide Players for not just 1 song but for their entire first 2 albums! That's why I rate this item 5 stars; it's not so much for the video itself but for the wonderful music these musicians have created. Season's greetings!",1134172800,2,1124,4.592039800995025
7925879,5,B00004X026,"I love to put this DVD in on the ""snow"" function and have that in the background---it is very Christmasy and peaceful. Sometimes I listen to the music that is provided; other times I play my own favorite Christmas CDs, plug in my tree and enjoy the falling snow. It's a wonderful DVD and I highly recommend it.",1131840000,2,310,4.362068965517241
7925880,4,B00004X026,"I enjoyed this ""mood tape"" much more than most of the other ones I've sampled.  The music is fun and at times brilliant.  The snow scenes are enchanting, but repetetive, so it's better used for atmosphere rather than close watching.  The ""Christmas Log"" function, however, is boring.  I guess you could use it for atmosphere, but it is a tape loop of the fire, rather than a real fire.  Fires have lives -- I would love to have seen the producers film a real fire for 90 minutes with it slowly dying down, logs collapsing and embers glowing when it was done.  Instead it seems more like a gimmick.
Still and all I enjoyed the snow and the music.",1041206400,3,645,4.378151260504202
