8568074,3,B00BGFCSJY,This lecture is difficult to focus on but content is gripping. How do humans grapple with the no-win scenario that is mortality?  Bread and circuses won't do it. Star Trek fans know this predicament as the Kobayashi maru.  Kirk rewrote the computer program. Spock gave his life to save the ship's company.  If this really gets to you you will find this cd lecture informative.,1417910400,2,376,4.753846153846154
