3729227,5,B001O7R75O,"No teacher of Shakespeare or verse should ignore this extraordinary series. It is simple yet so textured that you will want to play it again and again. It is well thought out in its approach
to considering the interpreters'problems regarding Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. The bonus here is that you see how the great actors of the English Stage for the last fifty years are able to work with the text in rehearsal, discuss freely and perform unde the direction of the brillant John Barton. My eye opening favorite was David Suchet(Hercule Poiroit)
and in the last segment Dame Peggy Ashcroft. The cast list is mind boggling and includes Dame Judy Dench,Sir Ian McKellan,Patrick Stewart and Ben Kingsley among other notables.",1247616000,19,727,5.016528925619835
3729228,5,B001O7R75O,This is interesting. Espeically the parts with Judi Dench as well as Judi Dench and Michael Williams even though he doesn't do that much with her. I also just like all the actors reading Shakespeare.,1245888000,2,199,4.714285714285714
3729229,5,B001O7R75O,"Indispensable for anyone interested in how Shakespeare's works are presented. It must be remembered these are actors of rare talent, as is the director.

3729230,5,B001O7R75O,"More than seven hours of company co-founder John Barton's classes in playing Shakespeare may sound dull, but it's actually incredibly moving, exciting, and, well, a heck of a lot of fun. The works are divided neatly into nine lessons, covering tradition, imagery, text, character, poetry, and other aspects that directly concern an actor's job in presenting Shakespeare's text to a modern audience with clarity and understanding. It's long been suggested that people who have to read Shakespeare hate him. And rightly so. ""Playing"" is the operative word here, and to see the excitement and joy the actors discover playing Shakespeare is simply wonderful. Let's pause to mention the actors here for their classes---perhaps we might remember Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Patrick Stewart, Ben Kingsley, Peggy Ashcroft, Roger Rees and Richard Pasco?",1243814400,37,842,5.435114503816794
3729231,5,B001O7R75O,"The actual DVD set is being reviewed. I didn't see the book or TV in 1984.
This series of 9 episodes (Or should we call them ""instructions"" in Shakespeare acting?) seem like they were shot yesterday. They are timeless. What, if anything is staged?  What is entirely impromptu? It's hard to say, nay, impossible. It's that well done. The wealth within this educational, academic experience is difficult to quickly review, but we'll give it a go.

""Playing SHAKESPEARE"" is the DVD presentation of acting workshops, done like a play rehearsal underway, shot in 1982, led by John Barton, who is himself entertaining, plus an encyclopedia on Shakespearean acting. He directed over 50 plays by the (RSC) Royal Shakespeare Company. A Cambridge professor. His main interest in this series is teaching toward the marriage of the Elizabethan acting tradition and modern times or style.  It is instruction dedicated to the actor--but it is of interest to so many more.

Through detailed Shakespeare direction, Barton has provided a series that will delight all lovers of the celebrated playwright. Additionally it will encourage the viewer who is newly attempting appreciation of Shakespeare and his works. Novice Shakespearean audiences will want for more, want for a complete play to view.

Much of the success of this series is the famous & talented actors being instructed. The top of the U.K. entertainers, both within the RSC and out. The BONUS FEATURES of this DVD set includes several of their bios and RSC credits.  Some, not all as there are over 20, are:
Peggy Ashcorft, 1907-1991, having at some time performed near all Shakespeare's female roles.
Judi Dench, UK Superstar, fantastic in ""As Time Goes By""
Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi"" and ""Schindler's List"" to name but 2
Ian McKellan, ""The Lord of the Rings"" fans will remember
Patrick Stewart, would you believe ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""
David Sachet, ""Poirot"", need more be said--yes--""The Way We Live Now""
Shakespeare wrote, ""Our revels now are ended."" Nay, Nay.

Here's the list of Episodes (Learning bits)
1 THE TWO TRADITIONS . . . . . . .2 USING THE VERSE
3 LANGUAGE AND CHARACTER . . . . .4 EXPLORING A CHARACTER
5 SET SPEECHES AND SOLILOQUIES . .6 IRONY AND AMBIGUITY
7 PASSION AND COOLNESS . . . . . .8 REHEARSING THE TEXT
9 POETRY AND HIDDEN POETRY
Each is a to-die-for opportunity for the student or the follower of Shakespeare. Not a full play or dramatic film, but an academic experience set in a working studio using excerpts.

In #3 language and words are discussed like Shakespeare's double syllable use of the word Ti-ime. And his often capitalization of the word, even when it's not the beginning word in the sentence. By watching another fine educational DVD series, ""The Adventure of English"", one can learn Shakespeare invented over 2000 words.
___Also in this segment, John Barton is coaxed into performing a bit of Shakespeare, which he does twice again during episode 9.
___#4 is outstanding when Shylock (The Merchant of Venice) is performed by Suchet (who is Jewish) and Stewart.  Both have played the role in RSC under Barton's direction. The 3 demonstrate how Shakespeare characters can be played in different ways, all being good. Suchet also suggests to view this play, not as anti-Semitic, but without the 20th century Holocaust prejudice.

Other bonus extras include a trailer for ""Slings & Arrows"" and the much valuable SUBTITLES, recommended to be used by all, to catch the full value of the Shakespeare words.

This DVD set makes me thirst for a Shakespeare play--a Shakespearean Sundae.

If you are a William Shakespeare lover--BUY.
If you are an actor, or student of theatre--BUY.
If you are curious of those often talked about plays--BUY.

More elaboration on this would take as long as the 400+ minutes of the set. Instead, in Shakespeare's own words: ""So to him we leave it.""",1242950400,108,3868,4.932307692307693
3729232,5,B001O7R75O,"I read John Barton's 'Playing Shakespeare' when I was in college and was encouraged to watch the companion VHS tapes. Unfortunately, they were only available in our college library and were fought over by hundreds of actors. I'm thrilled that this magnificent collection is now available on DVD. It's such a treat to see young, highly trained actors (McKellen, Dench, Stewart) from the RSC participating in Barton's Shakespeare instructional course. Barton discusses the most basic techniques on how to find clues within Shakespeare's text in order to perform it well. It is truly amazing that by simply approaching Shakespeare in a technical way; finding antithesis, lists, irony, and contrast-helps the actor figure out what is happening in a scene or monologue. Reading Barton's book makes sense and is a good reference, but the power behind this course is hearing the text and the technical adjustments the actors make with their voice. Don't be put off by the price; this instruction is rare.",1241827200,46,997,5.160493827160494

They are humble, earnest lovers of the bard, who joyfully go through the motions of unpacking the magic of iambic pentameter to the nth degree at John Barton's instruction. Everyone provides a thrill -- and every activity has pleasure for the viewer even if you know it all.

You may not come to the same conclusions as John Barton but at least you have something to think about and look for the next time you watch your favorite version.

A great side effect is seeing great actors when they were young. A school could build their class around this series.

When the language is acted about by such a powerfully talented group of actors who show us what John Barton tells us, the  effect is revelatory. Their devotion to Shakespeare's language and plays renders them agelessly fresh. And the Everest to these Shakespearean Himalayas is the final scene from ""The Winters Tale"" at the end of Episode 7. It is the finest Shakespeare moment I have seen, surpassed only by the full ""King Lear"" at The Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, CT back in the 1960's.

3729273,5,B001O7R75O,"Five stars is not enough.
If you are considering directing or teaching (aren't they the same thing?) Shakespeare, this series will be much more valuable than the Barton book derived from it, excellent though that is. I encountered this series while it was still on VHS, somewhat clunkier to use. As a teacher, you will find particular episodes to be particulary useful in class (e.g. ""I wonder now how yonder city stands"" from T&C in the ""time"" episode). As a director you will probably find yourself in imaginary conversations with Barton, as in his thought that single syllable lines should go slow (I think they should go quickly), but usually when such an issue arises the actors themselves discuss it politely but pointedly. The remarkable ensemble outshines ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Murder on the Orient Express"" in sheer numbers of today's stars, but even at the time of the recording of these sessions such an assemblage of talent must have been rare and remains, as far as I can tell, unique.

In ""our own"" age, Pacino's ""Looking for Richard"" (1996) may be as good--but there's simply less of it.
You will never fear Shakespeare again.",1409875200,,1144,4.866666666666666

This is to delving into Shakespearean performance what reading Shelby Foote's The Civil War: A Narrative is to probing American history. Watching it all is major undertaking, but one requiring little patience, for it's so engaging and engrossing that sometimes you hardly sense the passage of time. It's also a joy to see so many talented actors in their younger incarnations.

I'm impressed  by all the discussion and attention to language. I'm impressed by the astounding vibrant good looks and presence of the actors. Then, finally, I'm impressed by the tremendous skill portrayed by the actors.

I'm a very aural person - I could drown in the lush sounds of a fine human voice or musical instrument - or the sound of ocean waves. This is such a treat. I'm tempted to listen again and not even watch the actors, just enjoy the sound of their wonderful, fantastic voices.

Would like to note that this is the complete series of 9 episodes.  In the VHS set there were two added tapes from the earlier South Bank Show in which John Barton and other members of the RSC also participated, and was likely the springboard for the full series.  However Ian McKellen's discussion of the ""Tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech from Macbeth was in the earlier show and not part of the actual ""Playing Shakespeare"" series with John Barton and the RSC, and hence was not 'edited out' but simply not included.

I watched the first hour on grainy video tape in an acting class many years ago and jumped at the opportunity to own it when it became available on DVD, it does not disappoint. It is well worth the cost for any actor looking to make sense of classical dialogue, pacing and motivation. In addition it serves up an insider's view for any nonfactor looking for a greater understanding of some if not all of the methods and processes by which some of your favorite characters are brought to the stage.

The set includes one of the single best hours of television ever produced in my opinion in which host/producer John Barton, Patrick Stewart and David Suchet (Captain Jean Luc Picard and Hercule Poirot respectively) discuss and demonstrate the differences in their respective interpretations of Shylock from ""The Merchant of Venice"".

Moreover, as a teacher, I found that a performance-based analysis dovetails nicely with the more literary approachs that are typically used in educational settings.  Indeed, I have used some clips from the series in class to great effect, and, if nothing else, my students were impressed with the actors' enthusiasm for their craft and the great amount of work that goes into interpreting a part for the stage. All of this said, this series is still not for everyone. If one does not have background in Shakespeare, much of the context of the exercises and discussion would be (I imagine) a little bewildering; which is is to say, this is not a series for the novice (although one could presumably enjoy it if one's interest in the plays were of sufficient strength).

Barton, the Royal Shakespeare Company Director and emcee of these programs talks a lot of nonsense about a balanced approach which he does not really mean. He knows how the plays should be acted and he tells the actors and the viewers clearly how. His knowledge of how Shakespeare was giving instructions to the actors is impressive.",1255305600,,403,5.014925373134329

3729317,5,B001O7R75O,"""Playing Shakespeare"" is a set of four DVDs in which John Barton and members of the Royal Shakespeare Company investigate the problems and opportunities of contemporary Shakespearean acting. It features the young Judi Dench, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, plus plenty of other worthies less well known to Americans and should suggest to any actor a variety of interpretive approaches to the characters, verse and world-view of William Shakespeare. But it isn't just for actors. The way speeches and scenes are played, rethought, adjusted and played again is immensely entertaining and helps viewers understand that great Shakespearean acting consists of a number of highly specific choices. How should the first line---just the first line---of ""The Merchant of Venice"" be spoken, and what should it tell audiences about the character who utters it and his attitude toward himself and his companions? Hear the alternatives played out and come to understand what a wealth of training these Shakespearean specialists bring to the moment of performance. Barton introduces a number of topics, but it always comes down to mining the text for its unique and often hidden riches and ironies (sometimes hidden poetry), rather than merely imposing a generalized tone. The result will make you a better audience not just for Shakespeare but for any text-dominated theater. And sometimes the performances (even in street clothes with no settings) are better than anything yet released on DVD.",1254700800,4,1483,5.369098712446352
3729318,5,B001O7R75O,"I've studied Shakespeare in the literary version, but performance is entirely different and it can be baffling.  But, Barton's instructional DVD puts you in a workshop setting that is meaningful, beneficial and wonderful at demystifying the text.  I'm not even half way through the material and I'm already finding new intentions and meanings in performance.  I'd recommend this for ANYONE who is studying Shakespeare.  It's wonderful for both performance AND literary understanding.",1254441600,,483,5.666666666666667

3729320,5,B001O7R75O,"This collection features the great John Barton's master classes in acting Shakespeare and features some of the greatest Shakespearean actors of the age as his assistants.  The format is a combination of socratic dialogue and acting demonstration in which Barton uses his extraordinary skills as a dramaturge to tease out the subtleties of performance indicated by the verse itself.  It's also a continuous delight in that one gets to see acting greats McKellan, Dench, Stewart, Kingsley, Suchet, the great Peggy Ashcroft, and many others articulating their own approaches to their profession.  There are nine episodes for a total of 456 minutes of instruction and demonstration, and the box contains a booklet which highlights the main points of each episode, as well as a series of questions which suggest avenues for exploring each episode's premises further.  The series is a must-have for true Shakespeare lovers, actors, theatre programs, and anyone with a deep appreciation for the craft of acting and the enormous beauty of Shakespeare's scripts.",1252713600,4,1053,5.363636363636363
3729321,5,B001O7R75O,"This is dated (1982) only in the sense that the production values are very simple, and John Barton will appear to Americans a little like PBS learn-to-paint guy Bob Ross (""happy little tree"").  It's not well lit or staged, but if you just settle in and roll with it you will find every minute is packed with interesting, entertaining, and valuable observations.

Perhaps what makes it most watchable and interesting, is the number of British movie stars well know to Americans - but before any of them had made any kind of popular impression on Americans.  For some, it would be over 15 years before they became movie stars in America.

Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Judi Dench, Ben Kingsley, and even Roger Rees who played Robin Colcourt on Cheers - they are all a part of this attempt to teach people how to act out Shakespeare.  It's a silly thing, but watching actors you are very familiar and comfortable with makes watching easier and more enjoyable.  And they are all fantastic actors to boot.

This is not just for actors, but for anyone who wants to know how to get ""inside"" the language, the play, and the characters.

Buy it, rent it, get it out from the library.

You'll be glad you did.",1250985600,6,1200,4.596244131455399
3729322,5,B001O7R75O,"Playing Shakespearean is a true gift into the insight of Shakespeare.  Aside from textual analysis into the poetry, John Barton and his cast of actors and actresses present the playwright's work in as many forms and angles as you can imagine, stretching the limits of interpretation.  My personal favorite moments occur when Barton himself takes on the role of the characters, and in the style of old English, performs monologues as close to the original Elizabethan style as I've ever heard.
  While the analysis can sometimes feel overwhelming, it is a joy to get inside the world of the art of acting.  Never having seen great works such as Hamlet, or Henry V in live performance, this show has brought Shakespeare to life for me, withstanding the fact that I already had a passion for his writing.  After watching these episodes you will have the urge to seek out live performances and compare how the acting you see compares to the approaches Barton suggests here.
  Order, watch and seek out live performances of Shakespeare.  Also, you can join the Facebook group that has sprung up and share you thoughts and feelings about this series:

3729323,5,B001O7R75O,"Any actor who even thinks they might encounter Shakespeare absolutely needs this series. I saw it originally, just once, back in 1983 and it has literally informed my performances ever since. I never open my mouth to speak a line of Shakespeare without going back to lessons I learned from this series. The companion book is great, but the real jewel is the actors, seeing how they perform and adjust the text to illustrate the various points. Completely invaluable and totally worth the price. Totally.

And if you're not an actor but enjoy Shakespeare this is about as good as it gets. Basically all the greatest Shakespearean actors of that generation giving virtuoso performances of all the best bits. Again, worth the price.

I've been trying to get my hands on this for years and years, and I'm so excited to find it available now.",1249776000,7,837,4.76551724137931
3729324,5,B001O7R75O,"Not having seen this series when it was first made, the chance to see it now is greatly appreciated.  Uh-oh, I thought, maybe it would be dead boring. Or maybe it would be enough that these professionals are giving us a glimpse at how great acting is constructed.  Of course it should be interesting.  But I didn't expect to sit on the edge of my chair for the first two hours, completely engaged, trying to figure out what, among the many ""bests"" of this series would be the very best.

Above all, there's the deep professionalism of all, from the donnish director John Barton, the puppet-master and the questioning teacher to each member of the RSC taking part in the exercise. With eyes twinkling, Barton pulls out one magic trick after another.

And that's just Barton.  Each actor -- all familiar and many old favorites -- is fascinating. The involvement of the whole person in acting becomes clear.  The movements are precise, the language is clear and crisp.  The intellect is fully engaged.  In some the physicality is rougher-edged and the intellect less showy but the acting no less spellbinding. In others, movements and gestures are like great dancing without ever going over the edge. Each performance is a revelation about language, discipline and dedication to craft. The egos are there, of course, but for these actors the respect for and generosity to others is notable.

Shakespeare takes some buffeting, in part because he is always adapted to current styles and ideas of theater.  He must be used to it by now. Some cornball part of me wanted him to emerge from the back of the set and make comments -- astonished, puzzled, ironic, pleased.  Or maybe he does just that through all who know the work and watch carefully.

This is one of those series that you want to keep forever, watch over and over again -- the rare set of DVD's which doesn't just gather dust on the shelf.",1249344000,18,1895,4.688821752265861

8329893,2,B001O7R75O,"What a pretentious P.O.S. (that's ""piece of Shakespeare"").  Episode-after-episode of a fat, sloppy John Barton holding court with some actors ranging from very accomplished (e.g., Ben Kingsley, Patrick Stewart and David Suchet) to a very pretty ""Sir"" and a coupla ""Dames"".

Presented as a sort of actors' workshop, IMO it comes off as scripted and rehearsed (never do two people talk at once, and the camera is always in just right place).  It gets two stars because I learned a few things, but I already love Shakespeare.  If not, it would've put me off his plays altogether.

Glad I watched it from the public library.",1518393600,,620,4.866666666666666

In a one-room backstage setting, the truly brilliant John Barton guides the viewer and a troupe of bona fide legends (household names too numerous to list here) on unlocking the clues hidden in the text. Lectures on verse and prose, heightened language, irony, and deep insight into character motivation and development. Select scenes and speeches are acted out and dissected. This series completely opened my eyes to the subtleties and intellect Shakespeare infused in his works for actors. Perhaps the greatest and most educational  series I've seen on the subject. As for the DVDs- the quality is good for it's age. The companion book is almost like a transcript of the episodes with two exclusive chapters for a bit more content.
