Cons: I am confused very much until the end where it ties it all together

""You're wicked! Wicked!""

Well, this review is from the DVD version that had just very recently been released. I am sure there will be a couple of more releases of special editions and what not.

 I liked this movie. I liked that it scared me. Movies do not usually scare me and haven't since movies like The Exorcist and classic horror of the like. The Others did scare me. The situation was very scary, the house where they lived was very scary, and the scary stories were very scary. That is, if you are afraid of ghosts.

 The movie's setting is during or right after the second world war. Nicole Kidman is a mother caring for her two children who suffer from this ultra-rare disease called Xeroderma Pigmentosum. This disease cannot allow any sunlight to hit their skin, because if it does, they will develop boils, and their throat will close and they will suffocate and die. The disease sounded bogus and silly until I watched the small documentary about the disease on Disc Two, and introduced me to a family whose youngest daughter had the condition.

 Anyway, not only is the house very big and very spooky, it also has to be very dark. It seems that they did not have electricity so it is kept dimly lit by candelight. Outside the house and grounds are covered by a deep thick fog that Nicole Kidman is waiting for to dissapate so that she can go to town and talk with the priest. Spooky!

Nicole Kidman is alone with her children, because her husband is off to fight the war, and her live-in servants had ""vanished into thin air"" a week before. She has a family of husband, wife and child who apply for the new servants position, and they do get the job. Something is creepy about them to, watch out.

 Her daughter, who is older than the son, tells stories about the ghosts she sees in the house, and scares the bejesus out of her younger brother, and eventually her mother too. You may think that she might need a spanking.

 Anyway, the suspense of when and how you will see or meet ""The Others"" with the creepy whispering and movement around the house sounds is very present. There are twists and turns as the story unfolds about the new servants, ""The Others"", Nicole's husband and the kids themselves that keep unraveling.

 I do recommend this movie on DVD, although the sound is very murky at first. I had to turn my DVD volume up quite a bit to hear what Nicole and the rest of the cast were mumbling throughout, but then when the ghosts are thumping or growling, it shook my house. Maybe the DVD people did that on purpose because it scared the crap out of me. I hope that everyone has the equipment to view this movie properly.",1503014400,6,2770,4.466269841269841

When I did get back to it I started over and continued on until getting into the many parts in the last 40 minutes that were unplayable, even though the disc looked perfect. So I would not recommend this seller to anyone and of course won't order from them again. At least the DVDs I bought from this seller were inexpensive, but then they turned out to be completely worthless.",1499731200,,579,4.2727272727272725

This is a great movie full of Gothic elements and some surprises! Nicole Kidman is fantastic in this movie and so are all the other actors and actresses. It might make you jump a few times, but this isn't one of those movies that relies on gore and special effects. It actually has a story - and it's a good one.",1494115200,2,449,5.818181818181818
1298954,5,B00003CYLJ,"A tour de force of acting above all, but also of every aspect of movies making. Nicole Kidman is absolutely amazing--as good as Deborah Kerr in The Innocents, and without Henry James!

1298955,5,B00003CYLJ,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a movie one night, came upon this one and decided to give it a watch; I mean, it's got Nicole Kidman so it must be good, we thought to ourselves...

Turns out it is one of the best horror, mystery thrillers I have seen yet! I love horror and thriller films so it is difficult to get a good scare out of me because I am always dissecting the movie and anticipating the scare  which sometimes is easy  but not with this film. At one point I literally yelped out loud like a frightened dog in a thunderstorm because it caught me so off-guard.

In casual conversation of favorite horror movies I will always name this one as a reference for someone to watch just because of how creative the plot is written and executed. Great acting, writing, execution and cinematography that'll have you wanting to place this movie on your shelf of your top favorite films.",1491955200,,892,4.420731707317073

Personally, I think this is not very sucessful thriller, however, it is a good drama. The very first time I saw the old lady and others I think they are the dead... After all the hearing in the house, however, Grace haven't seen any horror ghosts at all, and the nanny was very calm and warm towards her, which made the firm even less scary, but warmer. Towards the mid of the plot, the husband even comes back! which makes the family even happier, with a dream coming true!! In the end, when Grace found that she has nothing to be afraid of because she is the dead, she could finally rest in peace and let the scared people run away from the house ;) Isn't this a happy-ending comedy?!",1479686400,,759,4.270833333333333

The second disc had a Camp Sundown documentary about children with a pigmentation problem that sunlight can cause third-degree burns from slight exposure to kids who get to go out at night and have fun with other children from around the world who manage to have their families bring them to Camp Sundown. 2016 was a great year for me to see the movie and react to still pictures of The Others for the first time like a light that is always on and we are not only human.,1478908800,,579,4.37037037037037

1300304,5,B00003CYLJ,"I hardly ever give 5 stars but this one really deserves it.  It's a horror movie, but it's so much more than that.  It's entertaining and creepy as any good horror movie should be, but it's also thought provoking and deeply moving.  The movie is just perfectly written, directed, acted, and filmed in every way.  Nicole Kidman is especially magnificent in this movie.  I had to watch it twice.  It was even more satisfying the second time because so many little oblique references to what had happened immediately before the story began in the movie all made sense and came together beautifully once you know what had happened.",1477699200,,627,4.7592592592592595

You could also watch this with pre-teens and up which is a rare find especially if you're looking for a family Halloween movie.

While the movie at first seems to be an English gothic tale set in an old estate on a foggy moor, it evolves in a deeper and almost spiritual (forgive the pun) movie.

***Spoiler Alert***

Grace lives with her two children, Anne & Nicholas in a country house. Her husband, Charles, has gone off to fight the war but presumed dead. She is a Roman Catholic woman who has stern beliefs about how things should be.

Anne and Nicholas have a rare disease of photo-sensitivity and the curtains must be drawn tightly shut at all times. Anne draws pictures of ""people"" that she is constantly seeing in the house - she calls them ""the others"". Grace does not believe that they are ghosts. She believes that they are intruders.

Her employees help her search for these ""intruders"" and Grace stumbles on an album with photographs of dead people but there are several pages missing. She hears muffled voices and believes that they are being ""haunted"" so she runs out of the house in search of a priest to bless the house.

Outside, she sees Charles. She is shocked by this because she thought that he died at war. They return home but Charles seems ""distant"" and ""lost"".

I was taken totally by surprise with the final sequence of events which brings the whole uneasiness thing into focus.

1304975,5,B00003CYLJ,"I'm going to give this movie 5 Stars, because I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I feel as though this movie has broken away from the norm of its genre and, despite being a bit cliche at times, really pulls out a strong ending. I, personally, loved the movie and would gladly watch it a second time. Kidman gives a strong performance as the mother on the brink of insanity. The actors who played the children were quite good (though the boy's acting was a bit meh to me, he is quite young, and the girl was played so brilliantly that it made up for him). The servants, meh, their roles weren't terribly important. I'd have loved to see more from the mute girl, I feel that was an angle they really could've done more with, and didn't. The older woman (names are really hard for me) did a decent job, though, I felt that she gave away things a bit too much (not the actor but the lines).

I certainly had my suspicions throughout the film about what was happening, but didn't see the twist at the end coming until it was too late.

Below this line there are spoilers- Read on at your own risk.

I suspected when the three servants showed up that they were ghosts, and then I came to suspect that they were not ghosts, but that they were, perhaps, manipulating Grace, a woman already on the brink of insanity.

I suspected that perhaps the children were not real, or that they were not, in fact, allergic to the sunlight (and that Anne knew this) but their mother used that to keep them inside the house.

I suspected that Grace had killed her husband, or knew he had died and didn't want to tell her children. I suspected, briefly, that the children were not Anne's, and that she was dead, and had convinced herself that someone else's children were hers.

The movie gives you just enough clues to realize that something is wrong, and clever enough to not give you enough clues to figure out just what is wrong. A very moving tale of the living and the dead. It reminded me a little bit about the movie: The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis. You're just not sure what is going on, and yet the movie does throw clues that you that something is amiss. Something is not right. For fans of the supernatural genre, I highly recommend this now classic excellent movie. You will not be disappointed.",1470441600,14,678,4.658333333333333

1305203,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a unique horror film.  It's done in a British style with heavy accents, slow pace and eerily quiet atmosphere.

It's about Nicole Kidman and her young daughter and son who experience the presence of ghosts while living in a mansion.  For a while Nicole seems like a bitter woman who is really strict with her discipline which makes her kids miserable but keeps them in line.  She's a big believer in God, and such discussions with her kids are a notable part of the storyline in the first half (interesting discussions might I add, because it's always unique seeing a child's point of view on such subjects).

Meanwhile her daughter, played by Alakina Mann, seems to be a smarty pants and a know it all brat.  She goes against everything her mom says and believes in which creates friction between her and her mother.  She's not afraid to test her mother's patience either.  Also Alakina doesn't get along with the younger brother either because he's really scared and shy, especially whenever she brings up ghosts and encourages them to come out and play.  That's when the boys shyness really comes out.

For the longest time Alakina is convinced there's ghosts in the house but her mother doesn't really believe her daughter because she's pretty much a little brat looking for trouble.  That is until she's able to prove herself.  Alakina draws pictures of the ghosts she's been seeing.  This makes Nicole take serious notice.  Shortly after Nicole herself starts hearing unexplainable walking sounds upstairs, children talking and piano playing.  Nicole is now really terrified and walks around the house with a shotgun.

Also while all this is going on, three elderly housekeepers arrive (Fionnula Flanagan's character being the most important one, while the other two are either outside digging in the yard or being quiet and avoiding everyone).  Nicole demands that they follow her instructions carefully because it turns out the daughter and son have a condition that makes their skin sensitive to the sunlight.  They do as they're told, but there's a secret about them we find out later.  Not exactly hard to figure out what the secret is but whatever.

If the atmosphere isn't really your cup of tea, perhaps the storyline will win you over.  Then again not everyone likes British style horror stories.  I personally think British horrors can be fantastic because they usually have tremendously creepy atmosphere and tell a really good story with a major twist at the end.  The Others is no exception.  While you can pretty much guess who the housekeepers are because this one's pretty obvious, there's another HUGE twist that's really awesome.  I won't spoil what it is.  I'll just say several possibilities entered my mind, but I was wrong on all counts.  I loved the surprise factor there.  Let's just say the fog is thick for a reason.  The story also takes place in war times, and the father as a soldier briefly returns home from war.  He doesn't play much of a role though.

If I could find one complaint, it's that those other ghosts -including the old lady with the spooky eyes and hair- should have been given a bigger role.  But I don't want to say more about this because I'd spoil a major part of the story if I did.  Great movie seriously.  It kept my interest the whole way through.  It's a breath of fresh air watching a movie like the Others after so many inferior American ones that keep recycling the same clichs over and over. The Others reminds us what horror movies *should* be like.",1458345600,,3528,4.765676567656766

I loved Nicole Kidman's acting, she did her best with what she had to work with.

The two children were really annoying, but I think that they were supposed to be.

There was one particular scene that made no sense to me.
That was when the little girl suddenly looked really old and said, ""I am your daughter.""

This movie was not scary.
There was just one creepy scene, and what made it creepy was that it was real.
That was when they showed how people of that time took photos of the dead.
Back in those days, that was often the only time that a person was photographed in their entire lifetime, when they were dead.

I must admit that the twist ending really did surprise me.
I did not guess it at all.

This movie has the same type of twist at the end as The Sixth Sense.
Except, with the Sixth Sense, the twist was really obvious and I guessed it at the very beginning.

In Alejandro Amenbar's beautifully filmed and gradually paced horror film, we meet Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, superb in the role) living in a rambling country house located on Jersey (British Crown Dependency, located off the Normandy coast). WWII has just ended and Grace and her two children yearn for the return of husband and father Charles (Christopher Eccleston). Mysteriously and suddenly, her house staff has disappeared. But fortunately three servants led by Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) appear at her door seeking positions. Grace hires them, then introduces them and us to her children who suffer from a rare photosensitivity disorder. Under no circumstances can sunlight be allowed into the house, otherwise Anna (really well played by Alakina Mann) and Nicolas (James Bentley) will burn to the point of death. Needless to say, affairs get progressively weirder until the truth reveals itself to Grace and to us.

Horror films, for the most part, are schlocky constructions of cheap thrills and gore. Of course, we love them for just that. However, they can be elevated into thoughtful films (case in point, the terrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Babadook-HD/dp/B00P5968FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Babadook [HD</a>], which taps our deepest fears).

Such is the case with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Others-HD/dp/B00OI2MIJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Others [HD</a>]. The issues here revolve around facing your worst behaviors, your personal weaknesses, your need to deny and erase bad deeds, and, ultimately, to reject and reverse your own mortality, as well as that of those you love.

If a mindless scare fest is what you seek, this movie will disappoint you. If, though, you desire suspense, strangeness, and the psychological legerdemain of the human mind, you'll not do better than with this award-winning film.",1433808000,,2126,5.937908496732026

1306076,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Lost souls"". Yes, it can be described as characters of this extraordinary and mystical film. If you like movies with an unexpected end, of course, you can't go wrong with the choice. Because the film ""The Others"" creates in human perception, a stunning effect. I am truly convinced that this is the best role for Nicole Kidman. She played is very nervous and anxious woman who waiting for her husband to return from war. She is raised in a strict Puritan traditions, and therefore she feels obliged to bring up in such an atmosphere, and own children. At this point in their rural home starting to happen, a truly mystical event. Director Alejandro Amenbar has able expertly create to brilliant accents perception. As a true artist, he showed us the mysterious world of the human subconscious. In this world reigns, is fear, tension and mistrust to everything unknown. With each scene, the sense of danger increases and the viewer realizes that the heroes can't be saved. They are doomed. But why they can not be saved? The ending of the film will tell you about it eloquently and rest assured you will be pleased with this turn of plot.",1433289600,,1142,4.715

1307623,4,B00003CYLJ,"I'll have to admit, while watching The Others, I was often reminded of two classic horror movies from the early 60's that I absolutely adore, The Innocents (1961) and The Haunting (1963), the former also set in Britain and very similar in style, characters and atmosphere. The Others is certainly unlike most horror films of the modern era, far more reliant on it's creepy atmosphere and mysterious plot than graphic violence and blood and gore like many other horror films made nowadays do. It follows a mother named Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who live in an old gothic mansion on a small fogbound British Isle just after the end of World War 2. Grace's husband had left the family, become a soldier fighting for England, and apparently died on the battlefield, although he appears in the middle of the film, still alive though clearly traumatized by his experiences in the war, with a distant, haunted look in his eye. His wounds are both physical and mental, and he soon leaves the family once more, apparently because he thinks the war is not yet over. There are also three housekeepers who come to stay with the family, an old Irish woman named Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a similarly old Irish man named Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young mute woman named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy). What keeps from awarding this atmospheric masterpiece five stars is the fact that the character of Grace is incredibly stubborn and not very likable, at least not at first, and so it prevented me from fully sympathizing with her character, although I'm fully aware that she was made like that for a reason. Definitely better to buy this film and not rent. Thanks for reading :)",1386720000,,1742,4.790697674418604

I love this movie, the atmosphere, the characters, the story, everything is perfect. The ending is so unexpected, the story unfolds so great, the music improves the experience...An excellent movie that will thrill you every time, even you already know what will happen next. I've always considered this movie ""Drama-Suspense"" film and not horror, it's not scary but it really has moments of tension. Now in Blu Ray the experience is better than never...This movie is so grainy, but the blu ray presents a clear hi-def picture with great colors. The sound is stunning in dts HD Master Audio, the extras are the same ones included in the DVD release but they are worthy for this price. All in all, The Others is a must have in any High Def collection.",1379980800,,844,4.596026490066225
1307750,3,B00003CYLJ,"This isn't for those liking high-paced action, relentless violence or gore. But those who enjoy a well-developed plotline, detailed characterization, and isolated settings will feel as close to horror heaven as the past few years have delivered.

 The family is obviously unstable. The house is enclosed in darkness due to a rare disorder the children have concerning light or the sun. It could kill them, the mother Grace says. All doors must be locked when they are closed, the windows must always be drawn, candles are to be used for the artificial light which they must live by. Set back in olden times the father/husband has gone to war and hasn't returned. Sitting there with bible studies, migraines and stress the mother waits and watches for his return, trying her best to care for the two children she must raise by herself, and wanting to instill in them the importance and fear of God. And now the children begin to fear that their home is haunted.

 The others involved are three servants. The main housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a stocky but polite woman who seems to have a few secrets of her own. A mute young girl with long unkept dark hair (Elaine Cassidy)who is seen at strange moments, and the gardener - an older man (Eric Sykes) who may or may not be married to Mills - I didn't catch if they were tied together in any way or not. The help doesn't add much to the story except for the old woman lead. Her dialogue is a bit too ominious at times but as the movie progresses it turns out to be a very effective role.

 This movie is so wrapped up in the unknown that it can't help but be dark and give you the jeebies. This is a supernatural horror film NOT run down by off the wall SF. (cough) The Haunting (cough). As we're watching little things are thrown in that shoot any previous theories we formed to s***. Through the movie we're not sure what is what. Bouncing from childhood tricks and games to signs of spooks; creepy servants who showed out of nowhere and obviously have something they're hiding; glimpses of insanity and strain of the woman and the children -- we have a pure-bred horror/mystery glee on our hands.

 I was kept on my toes until the end, which delivered a powerful climax. Whatever else, don't let the ending be ruined for you. Maybe some people saw it a mile away but I didn't. And I also didn't try to sit and try to figure it out, either, as I *didn't* want to know yet. It may not be the most original of concepts but it works.

 I find the movie a little similar to The Shining. Isolation, cabin fever. A woman trapped with two kids, no escape, and no one to help her. Overburdened by responsibilites as Jack was with his duties, Grace is faced with even more pressure; how does she work through it?

 The directing by newcomer Alejandro Amenbar is hard to beat. Due to the darkness of the old house because of the kids, a dark and forbidden type mode is set. The tension is emphasized by long lapses of silence (no music) and whispered tones, quiet voices, no outside distraction like traffic, the television. Then suddenly something is loud and startling. Most of the time heard and not seen. All work together to make this movie the best it could be. Nothing predictable in that you expect something to pop out of you and then it does; this is not a standard formula of cheap chills and thrills.

 Kidman blew me away as Grace. I'm not her greatest fan but I loved her in this. The children can actually act; Mrs. Mills does her part and the others are just...there. But they're meant to be.

 One bad thing I can think of is that this movie dragged a bit too much at some points. Sometimes wierd things took too long to take place, and I need to be in a movie watching mood to watch it from start to finish. Slow paced, definitely, but interesting even at the more quieter parts.

 Definitely a dynamic tale of macabre that should be valued as a top dog of supernatural horror.",1379635200,,3949,4.445983379501385

The movie doesn't get any real movement until the last half hour.  By the time the end dragged itself across the finish line, I had figured it out and was impressed with the fresh twist.

1307916,5,B00003CYLJ,"I stumbled on this movie on television on a lazy Sunday afternoon, didn't intend to watch it, but got hooked when other people in the house started watching it. At first it seemed fairly standard, leaning heavily on TURN OF THE SCREW for its inspiration (and I'm not a big fan of TURN OF THE SCREW). I couldn't figure out why Nicole Kidman, an A-list actress, would have chosen to do a derivative horror film. She was good, but to my eye, not as outstanding as other reviewers have said. But she was fine with the children, and the three servants were excellent - and spooky.

As the story spun out, though, it became clear that more was happening than it seemed at first. The tension level ratcheted up, and every scene held clues that would make sense later.

Without going any further, let's say that I was rocked by the ending - and by the brilliant buildup that had given the audience all the information we needed while misleading us all the way.

A simply terrific film I would definitely see again (I'm a sucker for beautifully written stories with great twists). The atmosphere is amazing, and while you may see some of it coming, I promise you won't see all of it.",1367107200,,1174,4.4766355140186915

1308049,5,B00003CYLJ,"An overly cautious mother takes on three new servants to look after her two children at their beautiful English estate, but all is not well in the Stewart household... Strange sounds and odd occurences wrack the quiet halls of the house, leading the children to believe that it may be haunted by the spirits of the past. After reaching world renown with his brilliant psychological thriller OPEN YOUR EYES, Spanish director Alejandro Amenbar returns with this chilling take on Gothic Horror entitled THE OTHERS. Inspired by genre classics like Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS or James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE, Amenbar allows himself plenty of time to build a steady growing suspense and oppressive mood. The director frequently winks at the audience through the character of Mrs. Mills, alluding to one of several plausible twist endings. Each of the cast members, including Nicole Kidman but especially the children, perform very well, and add to the playful ambiguity of the plot. The overall result is a tighly-drawn tension that will have audience members leaping out of their seats for the many surprise moments! A finely-crafted ghost story if ever there was one.

They have a rare disease that makes them very photosensitive and they can never be in the sunlight or even bright light as it can cause burns and blisters and kill them.

Strange events begin to occur in the home and the children claim to see ghosts. Their mother does not believe them but as time goes along she too is having and seeing strange occurrences. She is even carrying a shotgun to protect the family from whoever is in the house....

This is a multi-twisted plot with a lot of events coming together to make the story especially spine-chilling in the end. Nicole Kidman does a very good job in this movie in the lead role. The story has a surprise ending that will shock you.

1308308,5,B00003CYLJ,"If any film comes close to topping The Innocents with Deborah Kerr, as the ultimate haunted house film, it is this mastery film with its fascinating and original ""take"" on the haunted house genre.  Nicole Kidman gives a genius performance as the woman at the center of the mystery here, and her two children, a boy and a girl, are perfectly cast.  The other cast members are remarkable;  and every single person in this film looks extraordinary, and their behavior is carefully choreographed to be tantalizing and ultimately frightening.  The old house itself is magnificent, both inside and out.  But the true genius of the film is the original twists and revelations it brings to the genre. The ending is profoundly satisfying, making sense of the many chilling scenes throughout.  And make no mistake, there are chilling scenes here of such subtle horror that they take your breath away.  If you have not seen this, I would say most definitely see it.  it is my opinion that this film did not get the accolades it should have gotten when it was released.  But surely its fame is growing among those of us out here who treasure this kind of beautiful work in the genre.  This has to be on its way to classic status.",1336694400,2,1217,4.644859813084112
1308309,4,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman was extraordinary as a very controlling woman raising her two children who have a rare sensitivity to light in a haunted old mansion.  This plot was amazing as we slowly see that there are hauntings taking place which have some unusual complications.
It almost deserves five stars as a horror movie that doesn't rely on blood and guts to scare.  However I took off one star because it was too long and slow in the middle. I actually skipped about fifteen dull minutes of the middle section.  With some better,
heavier editing it would have earned five stars from me.

You will feel the chills washing over you as you watch this.  This is a ghost story that is first class for acting, story, and setting.  What a beautiful old estate.  I couldn't help thinking that I would put up with a few ghosts to live in such elegant surroundings.  There's a terrific plot twist about half an hour before the end when it really brings home
the creep factor.

The ending is especially creepy, more so for being
so sad and eerie.  It is really the high point, the final horror. Great acting and a beautiful ancient haunted mansion.
Without the skills and physical presence of Nicole Kidman this movie wouldn't have been nearly so great but she totally aced it.",1333238400,,1260,4.584821428571429

1308316,5,B00003CYLJ,"THE OTHERS is a classic film.  It is superbly written, directed and most importantly acted.  Nicole Kidman radiates in one of her finest performances and carries this film on her shoulders from beginning to end.  And this film has no gimmicks or over the top special effects.  It is a true ghost story and a very intelligent one at that.  If you are reading this you are probably already a fan of the film.  But how is it on blu ray.  Blu ray when used correctly can highly raise the bar of presentation on a film.  One would assume THE OTHERS might present a challenge for it is a dark film shot mostly in shadows and fog.  But the video presentation on the blu ray here does an amazing job.  The present graininess is original to the film and the atmospeheric fog and shadows take on new life while characters appear clearly throughout. Characters and scenery show through strong and clear with very strong clarity and crispness and skin tones are very realistic.  Colors are otherwise subdued for they are meant to be but the whole picture manages to shine levels above the dvd.  With this superb video we get an even better audio presentation.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio is superb.  This is mostly a dialogue driven film but there is beautiful soundtrack music and this is indeed a ghost story.  And what we get is very strong and present dialogue with surround sounds that come to dynamic life with the scares and chills and thrills.  This is indeed a haunting film and the audio presentation puts blu ray to great use.  Your whole speaker system will come to life and have you jumping out of your skin at all the right places.

This classic film gets the treatment it deserves on blu ray.  THE OTHERS is a film so intricate and detailed that multiple viewings will strongly be desired and the blu ray presentation will make each viewing that much better.  Every excellent thing about this film is made that much better on blu ray.  I highly recommend this film.  And if you already own the dvd give yourself a treat and get the blu ray.  This is an example of blu ray put to its best use.",1320969600,10,2096,4.443569553805775

1308442,5,B00003CYLJ,"What a great surprise ""the Others"" was! In the wake of a glut of ""Sixth Sense"" clones, I see the dead, I talk to the dead, I help the dead, the haunted house/ghost movie sub-genre was getting as stale as the overworked Zombie sub-genre. Dozens upon dozens of films, both big budget & straight to video haunting every rental DVD shelve in six continents! I was tired of seeing people in movies seeing the dead, ad nauseam.

So why was ""the Others"" so different? First of all, it was not a ""Sixth Sense"" clone, if anything, a anti ""Sixth Sense."" It was not a modern day haunted house/ghost film at all, but harkened back to ""The Innocents"" from 1961. It also reminded me of another great early 60's film, that was not a horror film at all, but had it's spooky moments, 1962's, ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Both these films had a brother & sister as main characters. Both these films had a single parent main character, or in the case ""of ""the Innocents,"" a nanny/governess, who was hired by a single parent. Both those films had strong bonds between the siblings. ""The Others,"" mother character, & ""the Innocents,"" governess character, were both overwrought to the point of insanity. All three films share a very intimate almost child like opening soundtrack. ""The Others"" & ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" especially. All three films were intimate, not a large cast, nor did they need one, though ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" did have a larger cast of characters, though it still remained a intimate childhood story of a adult world.

It has been said that Nicole Kidman's performance as ""Grace Stewart"" in ""the Others,"" is the greatest of her career, & I have to agree. Nicole is the epitome of a woman pushed over the edge of insanity. A nervous break down performance if there ever was one! It must have drained her, not only mentally, but physically. The siblings, Alakina Mann as ""Anne Stewart,"" & James Bently as ""Nicholas Stewart,"" provide this film with some of the strongest & most believable child performances I've ever seen! The supporting cast was excellent as well.

""The Others"" work so well because a taught & sturdy script, claustrophobic cinematography, spot on directing, & a soundtrack that is subtle, & when need be, crashing down like thunder. But it is the totally convincing acting, the effective spooky yet elegant mansion, & the tense well done sound effects that make this movie genuinely scary. It is the imagination of what could be lurking around the corner or behind a door that raises the prickly hairs on my neck. The thump in the dark. It is the twist ending that just blows me away every time I see this film! It is truly, the anti ""Sixth Sense,"" just when the badly over trodden haunted house/ghost sub-genre needed it the most!

This Blu-ray is highly recommended as a upgrade. Colors, images, lighting, & sound are about as good as it gets for a film like this!

1308443,3,B00003CYLJ,A well made movie and Nicole Kidman gives a good performance. My problem is that I found the movie tended to telegraph the twists and I figured out what was coming next each time. I enjoyed this movie once on a plane but I have not added to my collection.,1318636800,,255,4.12
1308444,5,B00003CYLJ,"Being someone involved with spirits myself (I do see and talk with dead people but it's not at all what films and particularly so-called reality T.V. shows make it out to be, and I don't earn a cent from it) I knew about this film but somehow never got around to seeing it (when you're a full-time teacher, a journalist, in show business and doing psychic work there isn't much time for movies) until now.  I loved it start to finish, very admiring of the script, cinematography, direction, casting, acting and the loving care given to every detail.  And I loved the ending, the kind of ending that means you'll have to watch the film again, and again many times possibly.  But upon reflection I also think there are enough holes in the premise to drive several large Army trucks through.  Then again maybe it's not holes but failure to provide an explanation.  Because from what I'm told, the other world is indeed constructed mentally but is as physical as this one, and that what people love here is replicated over there, including homes and fondest possessions. So that means the film would add up.  Though respecting Nicole Kidman's art I have never fallen in love with her an actress, always feeling she was cold and remote.  But in this film I fell hook, line and sinker for her classic beauty, subtlety, being her character and not just acting her character, and the immense range and shading of what she does in this film.  But, then, the entire acting ensemble is outstanding.

This is a truly atmospheric, slowly building and very convincing story that seduces you with real chills.  The only downside, IMO, is not with the movie itself, but the sound.  For some reason, the sound is so incredibly faint in this movie that you have to crank the TV waaaaaay up just to hear what the characters are saying.

1308637,4,B00003CYLJ,"I just finished watching this movie after renting it tonight.  Time to review it.

This movie was recommended to me by my friend here on Amazon, Brian Nallick (""Metalman Minnesota"").  Thanks Brian.

I don't want to go into a summary of the plot, etc. because there are 743 reviews already written.  I just want to say a few things.

I had heard a lot about this movie over the years, but had never seen it until tonight.  It's definitely a movie that is right up my alley - a haunted house/ghost story that relies on atmosphere and psychological horror and suspense rather than CGI, blood, gore, and anything and everything that is obvious.  This movie is often compared to The Innocents (1961).  The stories are at least loosely similar and certain scenes look alike in both movies.  In my opinion, The Others isn't quite as good as The Innocents, but it's definitely up there with the best haunted house/ghost story movies ever made.  Nicole Kidman does some great acting.  I think The Innocents has a spookier and more haunting atmosphere, but The Others has a lot of spooky moments as well.  Check out the outdoor scenes in the fog and at night.  The dim lighting throughout much of the movie really works (of course, the children need to be protected from the light).  The era that this movie takes place in is immediately after World War II, whereas The Innocents takes place in the nineteenth century.

Overall, The Others is a fine film that definitely deserves the praise it has gotten over the years.  I highly recommend it.",1289088000,2,1534,4.664179104477612
1308638,5,B00003CYLJ,"After reviewing ""What Lies Beneath"", which was a valiant (and failed) effort at classic chills, I was reminded of one of the few latter day thrillers that truly deserve the title. ""The Others"" still frightens, after all these years, and after countless viewings- even though I know what is going to happen. (Don't worry, no spoiler alert needed!)
The foggy Jersey Islands, the spooky servants who you truly believe are up to something nefarious, the sense of impending doom around every corner; the scenes with Kidman and the servants marching through the house searching for intruders- even the way the servant hands over the keys that final time before they exit- all still serve to frighten. There is nothing I love more than coming up on someone who has never seen the film and watching them try to figure it out- and no one ever does, even those who have seen such twisty thrillers as ""The Sixth Sense"" (which by the way, hasn't aged nearly as well as this one). If it had been made forty years ago, film students would be studying it. I hope time serves to put it right up there with ""The Innocents""- which is a work of absolute staggering genius, and a great companion for this on some cold, dark night by the fire. Probably the best haunted house film made in the past 25 years.",1287878400,,1286,4.571428571428571
1308639,2,B00003CYLJ,"There's nothing pleasant, happy, or redeeming about this movie.  There were tons of positive reviews for this movie on Amazon, but why would anyone like a movie about a mom who murders her kids and everyone from beginning to end is miserable?  Terrible movie.",1287792000,,259,4.863636363636363
1308640,5,B00003CYLJ,"One of the problems with reviewing a film which has been out for awhile is that you want to go into detail on the plot, assuming that most everyone looking it up at this late date - in the case of ""The Others"", almost ten years after its original release - has seen it at least once, and is picking it up for a repeat viewing, a refresher viewing of sorts. But this one has been around long enough where a new audience may, in fact, be finding it for the first time, and so I will try my best not to give out any key surprises to the script, and instead defend it for what it is not - and it is not a horror flick. If you're looking for something that will make you cover your eyes, jump every five minutes or forego the popcorn and other treats because you're assuming the blood spattering and chainsaws will put you just a bit off your appetite, this isn't the movie for you. But this is a very quiet, unsettling film, and it does deliver a few truly unnerving scenes. It's been described in many other reviews as a psychological horror film, and while I agree with the former, I think viewers trying to decide whether or not they'll download/buy it should NOT pay attention to that description. Here's why: Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman living with her two children on a country estate in England during wartime; her husband has gone off to fight, and the children, Anne and Nicholas, are very ill with a rare disease which makes them allergic to sunlight. Grace and the children are alone until three servants arrive at the house to assist the family; perhaps it should be said that Grace believes she and her children are alone in the house. The servants are there for other reasons than to simply make lunch and keep the yard up, but Grace is unaware of this, busy worrying about unexplained happenings in the house, her daughter Anne drawing pictures of people she insists are in the house with the family, and the children's illness. In the meantime, Grace ventures outside and into the fog, only to encounter her husband, whom we now realize she had assumed was killed in service. The husband returns to the estate with Grace, but doesn't stay long, and the happenings become more intense, often and dangerous - the curtains are being pulled from the windows, exposing the children to deadly sunlight. Many, many other events occur which an astute viewer may be able to start piecing together,and things culminate with Grace going through the house with a shotgun in hand, the servants explaining why they are actually there, and the children being the key to Grace finally understanding who is who, what is what, and what has happened. Now: That's about as much as I can say without spoiling the film for first timers, but I think I have made my point: There is not one single scene in this film which I think qualifies it as a screamer or horror flick, but I'll say it again - this is one very, very creepy movie, and it is written, directed and acted so well (Alakina Mann, the young girl who plays Anne, hits one right out of the ballpark with her work), that you find yourself getting those tiny little chills up your back that so many movies advertise will be present, and instead you're met with tortured summer campers, buckets of blood and screaming that actually gets boring after awhile. It is a movie that has you thinking from word one, and as you follow what's on screen with the own opinion you're forming - What's really happening here? Who or what are The Others? What more is there to the children's allergy to light? - that when the film does reach its' conclusion, even if you were wrong, you're satisfied because you got knocked for a loop with the twist. I think that this is a great, great movie, and while it did fine in its' original release financially, it went ignored in the awards area in this country. It did, however, win many major awards in Spain, including Best Picture, which may suggest that our neighbors have a better understanding that too much is overkill, and that whispered threat is more effective than howling and chain rattling. The DVD has tons of extras on it, including a fascinating short about the illness noted in the movie, xeroderma pigmentosum, and a feature on director Alejandro Amenabar. Finally, it should be noted that Nicole Kidman does a fine turn as the mother, Grace, and I personally think that she should have been considered for the Oscar in this role, rather than the one (THE HOURS) that she actually won for. Great movie: Remember, please leave your axes, chainsaws and oversexed, screaming campers at the door!",1287014400,2,4594,4.556227327690447

1308642,3,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a favorite movie of mine and many reviews here appropriately laud the movie.  It's one that I come back to time and time again, so I was excited to see it out on Blu-Ray.  While the video is appropriately stunning on blu, the audio I found very lacking.  I had to turn my surround sound volume up much higher than any other blu rays or dvds I've ever played.  It is a quiet movie, but it was just hard to hear.

The lack of any type of real menu - there are audio options only that pop up in movie - is a major flaw for any blu-ray disc.  Although you can skip scenes with the remote, you cannot select a scene, since there is no menu. Scene selection is a standard feature for any disc almost since the first dvd.  I personally also don't like the movie just starting up when I pop in the disc, but that's a minor quibble.

To have no other features - nothing in the way of behind-the-scenes, making of, interviews, commentary, not even the theatrical trailer (also pretty standard now) - for such a fine film is surprising and highly unfortunate.  If any movie deserves such attention, this one does.

To reiterate, the movie is fantastic and well worth the $10 dollars I paid from a third party seller.  Had I paid more (especially the $33 that Amazon is asking for), I would have been angry given the lack of even the most standard of features.",1278460800,5,1362,4.28125
1308643,5,B00003CYLJ,"Atmospheric, brooding, eerie - this movie is all that and more. ""The Others"" isn't filled with shocking emanations. Actual scares are few and far between. You'll realize the haunted nature of this house isolated on one of the Channel Islands just after World War II - more by soft, suggestive steps.

When Nicole Kidman's character explains that her children are photosensitive and have to be shut away from all natural light - the scene is set for flickering candlelight and dark corners. But it isn't all these elements of the classic ghost story that make ""The Others"" memorable. It's the brilliant way it's all wrapped up.

There isn't a lot of essential material on the separate ""Extras"" disc that comes with this Collector's Edition. The only feature I found to be really interesting is the mini-documentary about photosensitivity, a rare condition whose medical name is ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum."" A family that has a child living with the condition explains the lifestyle adjustments that they've made to accommodate the condition. One of the most helpful things they've done is to get their children in touch with other children who have the condition. They gather from all over periodically and have, not a day camp - but a night camp. They learn to appreciate the beauties of the night - as the characters in this outstanding movie must.",1278374400,3,1345,4.973333333333334
1308644,5,B00003CYLJ,"To clarify, I would give the movie itself 5/5 stars while the blu-ray would get 3.75/5 stars. As for the movie, I think The Others is a very atmospheric, intelligent ghost story, with solid performances and a well-written story. I highly recommend watching the blu-ray version; though an American studio will eventually bring the film to the blu-ray medium, this Canadian version will suffice -- I recommend purchasing it from one of the Marketplace sellers to take advantage of better pricing.

As far as this blu-ray transfer (1080i/DD/DTS) goes, I found it to be pretty solid overall. It suffers somewhat from telecine ""jitter"" and a few artifacts, but the colors are rich, and the contrast and sharpness are quite good. This is a very dark film, and the blacks are inky, but the shadows still reveal a good deal of detail. As some reviewers have noted, there is no menu, but the ""pop-up"" menu button on my remote brought up the Audio selection menu, and chapters can be browsed by using the ""|<<"" and "">>|"" buttons. When I compared this blu-ray to the DVD version I already had, I was stunned at how much better the blu-ray is! If you can find this blu-ray at a good price, I recommend it -- I would also recommend watching it in the dark with a good surround system (set on the DTS soundtrack); you might not want to watch alone, though! ;)",1277424000,,1345,4.604166666666667
1308645,5,B00003CYLJ,"Once `The Sixth Sense' opened to major critical acclaim back in 1999 it seemed that there was a sudden rush of `ghost films' making their way to your local theater.  Some of them failed miserably to capitalize on what made `The Sixth Sense' so remarkable and groundbreaking.  And then there were a select few that just got it right.

`The Others' is one of those few.

Now, working off of my last review for `Planet of the Apes' where I showed a negative example of `suffering' through the same film twice in a row; I actually saw `The Others' in the theater twice in the same day as well.  Yes, I had a lot of time to kill back in 2001 (apparently).  I also worked in the mall, so when I got off work I moseyed over to the theater (right around the corner from the store I worked in) and picked a flick to watch.  After watching `The Others' I was moved to call my friends and recommend they see it.  I was lucky enough to accompany them.

This movie still gives me shivers today.

I think what makes `The Others' so compelling is the way it uses the genre clichs to its benefit.  There is a lot going on here that is `standard' so-to-speak when you consider the genre, but this film manages to make it all work for it in a way that appears fresh and new to us.  The scares may be familiar (loud stomping in the dark) but this film pulls it off flawlessly.  The mood is beautifully set, with sets that are genuinely creepy without ever `trying to hard' to accomplish something.  The direction is sharp and the attention to detail is stellar here, actually building tension with every slipping frame.

And then there is the acting.

A lot of my friends consider Nicole Kidman's performance in `The Others' to actually be better than her Oscar nominated performance in `Moulin Rouge!'  It's hard for me to judge really, since they are so different, but truth be told that 2001 was a great year for Nicole.  She brilliantly captures the whole essence of this character, flawlessly exhibiting the right amount of chilled desolation needed to bring us into her shoes.  I also really enjoyed the young actors here, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.  They really understood the layers their characters needed to appear relatable and engaging.

And Fionnula Flanagan is just brilliantly creepy.

One thing I really LOVED about this film was the surprise ending that I NEVER SAW COMING.  There is a lot to be said about a twist ending that catches the viewer off guard without ever appearing to be forced or manipulated or preposterous.  This twist may even be better and more shocking than the one presented in `The Sixth Sense'!

Just watch this movie; and then watch it again.",1275350400,,2669,4.53347280334728
1308813,5,B00003CYLJ,"Please note: As I have seen only the one-disc version of this movie, this review concerns only the movie, not the extras.

The Others is perhaps the finest psychological horror movie ever made. It is NOT your usual kind of ghost story. It is a ghost story as Kafka might have written it.

Everything here is perfect: the acting, the screenwriting, the dialogue, the camerawork. Nicole Kidman performs her greatest movie role yet (besides her acting Virginia woolf in The Hours, another masterpiece). The child actors are very good, and so are everyone else in this movie. There are nice touches all over. To mention only one: when Grace exhibits her anxiety that there is something wrong in the house to the elderly housekeeper, the woman drily remarks: ""There isn't an answer to everything."" Bear that in mind when watching the rest of the movie...

The ending is especially horrifying if you consider it from the main characters' point of view. When you reach that point in the movie, ask yourself the question: in what kind of a situation the main characters are? Is the ending happy or sad? Both? Neither? In my opinion, this masterpiece of a film is entirely beyond such easy dichotomies.

Sure, the film has a twist ending; but that is not to say that once you know the ending, you know all there is to learn about this movie. The Others is a film that can be watched many times with much enjoyment. Watching it the second, third or fourth time brings into play an element of ""romantic irony"", as you by then know more about the characters than the characters themselves...

As a classical music fan, I'm also fascinated by the soundtrack, which was actually composed by the director himself! This music really works, adding wonderful atmosphere to the scenes the way only the best film music can.

After directing this perfect gem, I sincerely wish that Alejandro Amenabar has not exhausted his creativity, but will give us more splendid films to admire also in the future. He certainly is a name to watch.",1271894400,,2013,4.7371428571428575
1308814,5,B00003CYLJ,"I love it when a movie can surprise me since it's rare that ever happens.  So when I come across a movie like ""The Others"" that I thought I had all figured out, only to be delightfully proved wrong, I get very excited.  There's a plot twist involving the elderly couple that I guessed early on, and I suspect most audiences will suspect early on.  However, the final ending was something I had NO idea was going to happen.

This movie moves slowly in some parts, however, Nicole Kidman's character is so bizarre that I was able to keep interested in this movie even during the slow parts.  I kept trying to figure her out.
An example of her bizarre behavior is in the beginning when she takes all these special precautions and administers warnings before anyone can even see her kids.  I kept wondering if her kids had rabies or something.

1308821,5,B00003CYLJ,"A ghost story unlike any other. Director Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is one of those far too rare jewels of the genre.  With a strong plot, memorable characters, haunting atmosphere and more layers than one can uncover in a couple of viewings, this film is a masterpiece of film-making.

Unlike the vast majority of horror films out there that have to rely on slash fests, vulgarity, nudity and buckets of blood to try to smokescreen for weak plots of less than mediocre and forgetful films, The Others, is on that short list category with films like Jack Clayton's The Innocents, from the 1961 which was based on a Henry James story, Robert Wize's The Haunting, from 1963, adapted from Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining adapted from Steven King's masterpiece novel in 1980.

1308939,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" takes place on Jersey, one of the British islands in the English Channel which was occupied by the Germans in World War II. It's a scary movie with devastating secrets and a story reminiscent of Henry James's ""Turn of the Screw"", but this plot has more chills. Nicole Kidman, playing a widow, does a superb job of acting in this movie, and everyone involved is excellent. A creepy old mansion is constantly dark within; the drapes are always drawn because Kidman's young son and daughter are severely sensitive to sunlight.
 The photography and atmospherics are wonderfully done. The three servants who just show up at the door and whom Kidman hires foreshadow bad stuff to follow. Kidman is constantly locking and unlocking inside doors in the big house which lacks electricity and phones. The suspenseful isolation becomes a part of the gripping film with its ghosts and Gothic horrors. Kidman plays the cold, forbidding role of the mother who frightens her own children with her fears and her piousness.

1309093,5,B00003CYLJ,"For a film that reeks of ""The Sixth Sense"" (the M. Night Shyamalan juggernaut that set a new precedent for paranormal movies), ""The Others"" still manages to hold its own with a talented cast, excellent and subtle visual effects and a rousing ghost story that like the above mentioned film, contains a predictable yet entertaining twist.

Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman is Grace, a young woman living in the seclusion of the Channel Islands during the close of World War II.  Her grand estate has mysteriously emptied itself of each and every one of its servants and with her husband on the front line in France, she is forced to take matters into her own hands and hire an entirely new staff. Before she has even placed an ad in the paper, a man and two women show up at her stoop one misty morning looking for work.  Bertha Mills (Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Sykes) and Lydia (Cassidy) all previously served in Grace's household years ago when another family occupied its grand quarters.  Relieved by their familiarity with the grounds, Grace hires them with nary an inquisition.  All she asks of them is their strict attention to the invariable darkness, for Nicolas (Bentley) and Anne (Mann), her two young children, are inflicted with a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight - too much exposure can prove fatal.

Once all are settled and the house makes it slow recovery from disrepair, strange goings-on begin to occur.  Noises are heard, unidentified voices whisper through the dark hallways and Nicolas and Anne are harassed by an entity named Victor, a young spirit with whom Anne has conversed on several occasions.  An ardent Catholic, Grace is skeptical about the possibility of the house being haunted and passes Anne's and Nicolas's allegations off as outrageous stories, forcing them to repent for so-called lies by reading passages out of the bible for hours on end.  All the while, Grace fights her own battle with loneliness and the steady slip of her sanity, her grief over the extensive absence of her husband Charles (Eccleston) and the pressure of caring for two children on her own pushing her to the edge.

Director Alejandro Amenabar literally had carte blanche when he did this picture - not only did he direct, but he wrote the screenplay and composed the entire original score, a combination of haunting and beautiful compositions.  For a 28-year-old director who was flattered by the 2001 remake of his film ""Obre Los Ojos"" (""Vanilla Sky"") and assumed three major aspects of a motion picture, Amenabar is not just multi-talented - he's an entrepreneur.

In a film like this, lighting and sound are integral and they become metaphoric as well.  It is used to great effect by Amenabar - we are at first almost completely in the dark about the truth.  Then, slowly, as more light is poured upon it, we begin to see bit by bit the terrible secret that Grace and her children have been hiding all this time.  Shadows are aplenty here and the more there are the scarier it is, the viewer's eyes playing just as many tricks on them as the characters.  When there is light, it is either stark and blinding or finely covered with cloud and haze, in keeping with the characters' inability to see beyond the present.  In order to get the best scares out of his audience, Amenabar keeps the score quiet and illusive, at times completely absent so that the creaks and bumps of the vast manor are all the more disquieting.

There isn't a bad performance to be found here, the movie filled with talented newcomers and favored veterans.  Kidman, now an Oscar winner for ""The Hours"", is the stand-out as Grace, a woman who inwardly endures immense despair and hides her tortured heart from the world with a steely front and her staunch faith.  Also excellent are Fionnula Flanagan (Waking Ned Devine) as the warm-hearted Mrs. Mills and Alakina Mann as the headstrong Anne - Mann has to be one of the least precocious and most talented child actors I've seen in a while.  I hope she gets more work.

The Dimension Collector's Series 2-disc edition has some interesting bonus material, in particular the Visual Effects Piece which shows all the different layers of digital effects used to create the spooky environs of the mansion and its grounds.  Also of interest is the segment ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum: What Is It? The Story of a Family Dealing with the Disease Portrayed in The Others"" as well as a making-of documentary on the film and a docu-interview on Alejandro Amenabar.

Bottom line: If you haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" or you just like a good ghost story in general, ""The Others"" is guaranteed to satisfy on many levels.",1214352000,4,4654,4.795994993742178

1309097,4,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a psychological thriller set in a haunted house, so don't let the PG-13 rating fool you, this is a hardcore old style horror film.  It is far more of a horror film than the blood-soaked money-making trash infiltrating our beloved cinemas every weekend and harkens back in spirit to supernatural classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunting/dp/B00009NHB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Changeling/dp/0783116926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Changeling</a>, which I would also recommend.

Two important things make The Others special.  Firstly, the mystery element is so powerful that it is a hard film to watch without finishing.  As a lover of horror films I've always felt that horror without mystery descends to madness, and other than for getting a good chuckle while disturbing your wife I would see little reason to watch a movie like that.  Gore can work in the right hands but it is rarely a necessity for something to scare this viewer.  What is necessary for me is surprise, which The Others is chock full of.  It is a smart film.  Secondly, another incredibly important element to all films for me is characters that work.  That kind of thing requires success on a number of fronts; namely the screenplay, and the actors, but here the cinematography, music, and art direction are just as crucial.  It is no coincidence that one mind directed this film in every way as almost every element mends together perfectly.  Tom Cruise may have been a producer but he clearly kept his Hollywood ego in check and let director Alejandro Amenbar (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Your-Eyes/dp/B00005LZOD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Your Eyes</a>) run this show his way and his way alone, even if it meant turning Cruise's then-wife into an emotional wreck in doing so.  Nicole Kidman was very possibly driven temporarily insane while starring in almost every frame of this movie and looking exhausted as she seems to consume herself in the role.  An underrated virtuoso performance for sure in a film that constantly appears alarmingly isolated.  I get exhausted for her while watching The Others unfold.

There are so many potentially devastating spoilers to mention in The Others and for those who haven't seen it I should tread carefully.  The film is set in a giant house in the Bailiwick of Jersey (a Crown dependency off the coast of Normandy), but I'm not sure if it's the main island or not.  It certainly appears isolated enough not to be, and really the house and its vast foggy property are all we have for a setting in The Others anyhow.  The film takes place just after World War II.  A family of three; Grace (Kidman) and her two children Anne and Nicholas, wait with little hope in their home for Charles, their husband and father, to return from the war.  The children have a unique condition that makes them extremely sensitive to sunlit, perhaps even allergic.  Their home's light is constantly being carefully controlled and maintained, making for an effective atmosphere of both vulnerability and isolation.  I'm sure that the controlled light inside and the surrounding fog of suffocation outside made the film's cinematography an exciting task and Javier Aguirresarobe delivers quite nicely.  The house is soon visited by three new servants and the story goes forward with many exciting twists and turns.

As a bit of a horror movie snob I'm going to recommend The Others twice.  Another look after you know the twists is definitely worthwhile.  Everything comes together just right for the sake of giving us a little scare and some fun surprises.  Inexplicably, The Others was also a rare success for a smaller film that seemed to put substance before anything else.  It made over $200 million worldwide and cost just $17 million to make.  I'm sure that success was anchored to some degree by the film's very famous leading actress but nevertheless, it is nice to see good film-making rewarded with a deserving bonus.",1207526400,12,4157,5.381761978361669
1309098,4,B00003CYLJ,There is a difference between being scared and being creeped out. The Others is in no way a horror film. But it will give you constant chills. Its superbly acted and effective atmosphere make it one of the best ghost type films out there. This is more than a 'huge creepy house' type mystery. And there is mystery. There is suspence. But there is a great sadness to this film too and Nicole Kidman perfectly accomplishes this by acting as she has never acted before. Its no wonder she got nominated for this role. Its so subtle but you really have to be able to pull it off. The scenery is just so perfectly morose you really get into it. This movie does not dissapoint.,1202169600,,670,4.368

1309200,4,B00003CYLJ,"A film about a mother and children who live in a big mansion alone on an island, during war time. They eventually learn that they just might not be alone. I don't like giving away much of the story, so thats why ive spared the details.

Visually this films atmosphere is quite dark and foggy, and sets perfect mood for such a movie and story. I love the house, i wish they showed even more of it, becouse the furnishing and style of the homes exterior and interior are interesting.

The music that we have to accompany us through the rooms and events in the film is well done. The films main theme is a fine meloncholic mystery to it. The soundtrack was very important in this film, and plays a good role.

Nicole Kidman's acting as the mom was good in this film; so was the acting of the two children, it was interesting to hear them talk, like the daughter who convincingly intelligent for her age.
We also meet three servants, who i find as the most enjoyable of all the characters in the film, an older lady, an older gentlman, and a young girl thats in her early 20s. And out of those three, i found Mr. Toddle's acting as the most entertaining, to me, personally, though he nowhere near had as big a role as the mother. But i love british acting like that, and i wish he had more lines.

The best acting i feel is from the supporting cast, becouse they really made me forget they were acting and in a movie, their skill is that good.
 While Nichole Kidman (the Mother) acted decent, i still kept seeing her as performing infront of the camera, at times, but shes not a bad actress. I just enjoyed the servant's performance the most, and the daughters is interesting too, whose little brother is very good too.

 The plot is not bad at all and like the cover says ""It has a wicked twist of an ending"". And theres depth to the characters. Theres something interesting we learn about everyone as we are introduced to the characters, especially the kids, who you will find have a unique circumstance, to say the least.

It has classic scares and suspense, and would be a fine addition to anyones scary film collection.

What has me coming back to the movie is the acting, and the music and the scenery. When youve seen it once and discover how it all unfolds, you no longer have any more suprises the next time you wanna watch it. So what do ya have? Again, i really liked the acting by the supporting chacters and everyone, and the music and atmosphere of this huge and VERY DARK mansion/palace is quite interesting to experience multiple times.
Though my only ""complaint"" would be that i wish we saw much much more of the place. That mansion is enormous...i would of lashed over every detail of such a fine place as that if they took the time to widen the scope of the viewers look within the house and rooms and all that.

 I think it would of gave the film vast and spralling character, i wish they could of tacked on more time to show scenes of the very exploration of this place.

But thats just more of a personal wish, and doesnt tarnish the film at all. I just think i would of loved this movie if it took us on a more epic perspective, visually, when it came to the house. Though scenes of outdoors are more roomy, but still, outting into the forrest are overwhelmed by thick fog. Now that i think of it, a wonderfully haunting jaunt into the woods would of been very fascinating. But the fog kind of keeps everyone captive, so to speak. Again...just a personal peeve that doesnt tarnish anything, just would of made the film grander.

Anyways...this version comes with special features, that are pretty interesting. Youll see a feature Documentary of the film, a feaurette on the Special FX found in the movie.

Also a featurette showing an actual real life family who have children dealing with what the kids in movie apparently deal with. ( and No, i cant tell you what there situation is...go watch the movie, its worth finding out on your own)

And a close look at the director, if that at all appeals to you.
Plus a still gallery , such and such and so on.

Its really cool how quality films like this are being sold for bargain prices. I bought my copy, used, for 5 dollars, and it was very good condition.
Its worth buying, even at list price/ brand new without any discounts.

1309202,4,B00003CYLJ,"A ghost story that does not look like one. A quite acceptable situation, though rather bizarre, without being strange. Every detail is slightly surprising, or original but believable. The whole object of the film is to reverse the situation of the beginning to reveal the truth and those who seem normal and pretend they are haunted by some ghosts end up being the real ghosts. It all hinges around the paranoia of the mother. She is obsessed by something that makes her tense or angry in no time and for little. Till one day she breaks down completely when those they call the intruders take down all the curtains that are draping all the windows of the house. The end then is banal: the living intruders abandon the house in the hands of the dead ghosts. The interest of the film is this inverted situation, this upside down ghost story. Then we are irritated or bothered by the way they don't speak but only whisper, the way they are obsessed by keys and locked doors, by any sound that is not explainable from their sole point of view. Everything is done in nuances, discretely, hardly fully expressed. We have to navigate among these strange milestones or obstacles to finally understand the truth but only when it is revealed to us. A very effective film but a film that does not require a second viewing because it only works if we do not know the truth. We have to be fooled to enjoy the film.

I wonder if they do it on purpose with some dvd's, making the dialogue so quiet that you need to crank your tv volume up a great deal. Then comes a deafening sound effect (or part of the film score, or a scream, etc) and it shakes the house.

That one negative being said, this is one of my favorite old fashioned, haunted house films. It is genuinely frightening. And the scares aren't cheap tricks or gimmicks that we've become used to from Hollywood. This film is a refreshing change from the usual junk that calls itself a horror movie but never really gets under your skin or genuinely creeps you out.

1309318,4,B00003CYLJ,"I felt the twist from the 6th Sense was a knock-off of a children book that I read about 14-18 years ago.  I was even more shocked that this movie eerily had more resemblances to that children book.  Actually this movie started very slowly and about 3/4 of the way in to it, I got this strangle feeling how it was going to end.  And I was right.

The acting was good, but if you were casually watching it, there were not much in the early scenes to excite you. Nicole Kidman moving from room to room as exciting as it sound gets pointless.  It had the potential of being a small world feeling like ""An American Haunting"" type movies that end up half baked.  The ending really redeemed the whole movie in the  last 10 minutes or so.  The ending is like most modern ghost stories: The Sixth Sense, Silent Hill, Stay, Mulholland Drive where the plot string you along in a curtain narrative (somewhat confusing storyline) and in the final ten minutes tell you the truth and then you go: oooh.  I think that is cheating, but some of my favorites movies: 6th Sense, 12 Monkeys, Silent Hill, Mul. Dr. are done in this style.  They were more interesting in the beginning though.

The spoilers so keep away-

The children book I am referring to, which I forgot the title, is about 2 children living by a lake.  Some of the details may be a little foggy.  For some reasons the children were abused verbally and physically by some woman, forgot who.  The kids goal were to seek out their mothers (in this sense the father of this movies) to protect them.  But she seems distant and they never could catch her when they get close (like the widow in the 6th Sense).  When they finally did by a lake, they found out their fate.  Their mother, if I remembered, commented suicide into the lake joining her two children that drowned there sometime ago.  They were reunited at death and the mean lady that was abusing them was actually alive (like the clairvoyant and the boy, Victor in this movie) and so was their mother at the time.  I might be wrong recalling some of the details from the children book, but that was some time ago.  I do remembered being sad/ upset for a whole week; why on earth would an elementary school library be so cruel to have a book like that.  I then thought it would also have made a good movie and a profound experience for other.  If you know what book I am talking about, post a comment.

The ending of this movie really reflected why some situations occurred early on.  Why the faces of the two children were pale with spider vein at times.  The mother and children odd mood swings.  All the pictures and foggy scenes made more sense too.  The reason for the light: referring to spirits moving on to the other side, and the curtains: the living moving out.

Overall, if you have not seen the 6th Sense or read a similar ghost story, this is definitely a superb movie.  Even if the tension was slowly building up at the beginning it really heightens at the end.  Very well executed.",1176595200,2,2999,4.388384754990925

1309320,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is surely unipue, as other reviewers have said.  It is very well cast and acted.  Nicole Kidman is wonderful as always.  However, I am surprised that other reviewers, including Amazon's reviewer, liken this movie to ""The Innocents"" circa 1961.  ""The Innocents comprised a female run household, a pre-teen boy and girl siblings, and a few servants; that is where the similarities end.  Although the children in ""The Innocence"" were also impressive actors, they became posessed by malevolent spirits and became secretive, mischievous, and was suspected of general wickeness.  Because I don't want to expose or spoil the plot, I will just say that ""The Others"" is very different.

The truely exceptional acting of the two pre-teens in ""The Others"" is why I've added this movie to my permanent collection.  The younger sibling, played by James Bentley, has a timid personality and can display fright and terror like no other.  His facial expressions, body language, and voice will make you go pale.  The slightly older sibling, played by Alakina Mann, is the Joan of Arc type.  She is centered, out-spoken, radiates intelligence, and takes not too kindly to being accused or punished for something she knows she didn't do.

On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.

One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.

Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.

The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.

Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.

It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.

This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.",1166745600,,3586,4.859247135842881

I didn't figure out the plot twist 'til it was made obvious---I hadn't watched The Sixth Sense with its similar plot twist.

Warning--plot spoilers ahead...
Nicole Kidman delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Grace, an uptight woman trying her best to raise her two young children as they await the return of her husband.  The setting takes place in an English mansion shortly after WWII.  Grace employs servants who slowly and patiently initiate her into her actual status as a ghost.  Grace uses her detection skills to figure out that there's something off about the servants--and there are inexplicable photographs of them (if I'm remembering correctly--it's been about three or so years since I've seen this movie).  To Grace's horror, she realizes these are pictures taken of people after they have died. For most of the movie, Grace is both confident and rigid about her belief system; towards the end of the movie--after learning she is no longer alive, yet still wanders upon the earth as though she were alive--Grace admits to her children that she doesn't know.  She thought she had all of the answers, but nothing turned out as she expected.  We see from the ghosts' perspective when the housekeeper warns Grace that ""there will be others.""  We the living are ""the others"" who impose upon the rest and routines of the life-like dead.

This movie is thematically rich, giving its audience both the willies and food for thought. It was well crafted and excellently paced.",1165622400,2,1655,5.0256410256410255
1309459,4,B00003CYLJ,"This was a slower-paced thriller that really grabbed me from the get go.  The settings and acting were top notch as ""others"" have stated.

You could feel the nervous tension that the mother felt and the strange relationship she had with her children. She seemed to both love them and be frustrated with them all at the same time.  The children, especially the daughter were very interesting characters with their own ""issues"". I was wondering at times if the daughter was ""in"" on anything or perhaps part of a greater plot twist.

The servants had that overly helpful, polite yet chilling friendliness about them.  They were soooo helpful yet there was this feeling of uneasiness when they were on screen and like the daughter I couldn't decide if they were part of a ploy or tied to the house in a special way?  Very cool.

My 4 star rating that I would have made a 3.5 is mostly because the ending was OK but not spectacular. It wasn't ""canned"" or anything but it didn't blow me away either.

Overall this film was very well done and for a change had some intelligence built-in. There were minimal if any plot holes or ""silliness"" which you always seem to get with horror movies these days. Its refreshing to see so much effort spent on settings as well.... that house is about as creepy as you can get!

1309460,5,B00003CYLJ,"What can one add to a masterpiece?

The cast is superb, the dialogues are perfect, the house is both creepy and engaging, and the rhythm is just as it must be.

I had my quibbles about Kidman, but she surely shows why she could act so well in ""The Hours"". She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all ""come together"". The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem :).

Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible :)). To all of us who have read ""The castle of Otranto"" in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about :)!

Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget ""Fionnula Flanagan"" and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between ""Master and servant"". Body language too!

This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! ""kate_hartshorn"" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a ""psychology of perception"" course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's ""plot keywords"" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).

I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the ""rules of the genre"" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla ""Pacino"" or something heroic, political or socially relevant.

I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a ""second viewing"". At least, not in the near future. And certainly NOT a third one!!

1309462,4,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others,"" is not your typical ghost story. It is more subtle and subdued, without the blood and gore typical of the genre. This is a welcome relief sometimes, as I find some of the scariest films I have ever seen are more atmospheric, and low on blood and gore. There are times when the atmosphere of horror demands this type of imaginative and creative use. Also, the story itself is more of a drama based film, and the horror is introduced in a much more slower and very methodical way. There will be no spoilers in this review, as to write any would destroy the film for you if you have not seen it.

Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a mother with two young children. Both of her children  [a girl and boy] suffer from a rare disease of the skin. This photosensistivity to the sun demands that they be kept out of the light, with curtains covering the windows, and at no time are they ever to be let outside. When a trio of servants arrive at her door, she hires them immediately: as she is in need of help since her place is so large. Grace is awaiting her husband's return from the war [WWII]. The gloomy feel of the film, and near neurotic demeanor of Grace tell the viewer early on that there is something more to her and the children. Especially after the servants arrive.

Other reviews tend to give too much away or they just haven't watched the movie closely; ""it takes place before electricity""  No, the mother kept the electricty turned off since they had so many problems with the Germans during the war (II).  The cast is wonderful; esp Finonnula Flanagan as the housekeeper, sweet benign and all knowing and Kidman is truly an amazing actress; her pacing and pitch is never over the top even with such a 'heavy' role.

Bear in mind SUBTLETY and ATMOSPHERE are tools of the director and he knows what a musical score can do.  It's down right creepy, esp the Book of the Dead which I suppose is probably a true tradition.  It leaves you questioning your own belief system.  Myself I kept saying ""It's just a movie"" but it leaves that lingering doubt .. creepy, full of possibilities, maybe what we don't see what's in front of our faces.

Bertha Mills is right, down to Mr. Tuttles hair being a mess.  This is a movie I can watch again and again and marvel each time at the things I missed.  The current slasher films can't hold a candle to this.  It's a modern masterpiece, get it and enjoy it.",1155081600,3,1350,4.487704918032787

And who keeps creeping about, opening the drapes and mysteriously closing the doors in the big old house, when no one else is supposedly around?  All this, and creepy servants too!  The ingredients are stock, and the big twist isn't terribly revolutionary if you've seen A Certain Other Film About Seeing Dead People.  But Kidman, rising Phoenix-like from the ashes of Mrs. Tom Cruise, proves her star-making turn in ""Moulin Rouge!"" was no fluke; she gives this genre piece every bit of her intelligence and possibly crazed integrity, and it works you over like a thresher.

Either way, it is a very good movie and the Sixth Sense was not.

Of course, there are two ways of looking at the Sixth Sense.  Before the twist and after knowing the twist.  It really left the viewer with 2 flawed stories with a lot of problems.  Not to mention it was very boring.  And I didn't see anything special at all about the kid's acting ability saying ""I see dead people"".  I didn't buy it at all.

Anyway, this is a movie with basically the same twist as Sixth Sense but this will have an interesting buildup and the payoff is worthy of the buildup and does not leave anything that doesn't make sense or is an absurd jump in logic to justify.

1309619,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" has all the makings of a classic thriller: intense atmosphere, superb casting, agonizing suspense, and fine direction. It is the kind of film that would have put a smile on Hitchcock's face.

Nicole Kidman shows why she is one of our most talented living actresses in a performance that is among the best of the new century. Not for a moment was I doubtful about her portrayal, nor of any of the others in the cast. The child actors carry their weight superbly as well. No weak links here.

The atmosphere, as noted elsewhere, is enriched by shadowing effects, made possible by the interplay of light and darkness in a setting where light becomes disconcerting, distorting our conventional perception.

Nothing in the plot is left to chance. So convincing is the plot that the ending will take you aback, puzzle and perhaps confound. This is an intelligent film with a screenplay to contemplate; it is not just another one of those slash-and-gash-cheap-thrills-special-effects-induced horror flicks that pervade the market. Nor is it campy or cultist. It is both artistic and spiritual in its depth of dimension. Moreover, it is that rare thriller that will be almost as good on second showing as the first, if for no other reason than that the viewer will want to retrace the steps, so to speak.

Highly recommended for its completeness. But a suggestion here from a former high school English teacher: just before watching it read Walter de la Mare's ""The Listeners,"" then Robert Frost's ""Ghost House."" It will put you in the right frame of mind.",1141344000,3,1561,4.879245283018868

Cast:  Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Alakina Mann, James Bentley, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy, Renee Asherson, Gordon Reid, Keith Allen, Michelle Fairley.

Running Time:  104 minutes

Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments.

In the critically acclaimed ""The Others"", Nicole Kidman is Grace, an emphatically religious woman, devoted to her two creepy children, who appear to be afflicted with a severe sensitivity to light, so much so that they can not handle anything more than candlelight (which conveniently allows for lots of dark atmosphere to occupy the film). Every door in her huge, cavernous Victorian mansion off the coast of England must be closed and locked before the next can be opened, in order to prevent any light from leaking into a room where her children may be. Grace's husband is off fighting in World War II, which, strangely has just come to an end when the film opens. Of course, the audience can pretty much deduce that the poor guy has died during battle. Out of nowhere enter three domestic servants, apparently arriving to replace the previous three domestic servants who have abruptly and mysteriously disappeared one week earlier.  Things seem to be going along rather smoothly: servants tending to the house and kids (especially the bratty daughter, played to spine-tingly perfection by Alakina Mann) and Grace frantically opening and closing doors. Then doors open by themselves, curtains, once drawn, are oddly pulled back with no one in the room to do so, Grace and her kids (mostly the daughter) start hearing weird noises that seem to indicate the presence of others in the house. Ghosts? Maybe, but Grace will hear none of that nonsense. She just keeps telling her kids to shut up and stop lying to her about the noises.  Obviously, these noises aren't the imagination of the children and Grave soon learns that some her biggest fears are now a reality.

Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, ""The Others"" marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenbar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as ""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes"". Amenbar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.  Like ""The Sixth Sense"" before it, ""The Others"" prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenbar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjamn Fernndez, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.

With ""The Others"", Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. The actors who play Grace's children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent.  ""The Others"" is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. ""The Others"" takes its time to get to its reveal, and for the most part it is worth every minute.",1136073600,2,4659,5.245967741935484

1309759,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is a perfect ghost story for younger people in the PG-13 age range.  It is not violent, there is no nudity, no cruelty, no blood or extreme terror-filled scenes.  My daughter loves this film because, as she puts it, it is so ""sad"" and ""beautiful"" with cool music.  The children actors are astounding and will captivate any kid who watches.  The photography is excellent, the sets, ambiance, and especially the music is top-notch.  In a DVD sea of shocking and inappropriate horror subject matter, The Others offers something you as a parent can view with your child and actually

gain insights into tragedy, resolve, and hidden intentions.

The ending is especially good because it has no good or bad people or anything simplistic or pedestrian.

This being said, be cautioned that suicide, murder and a brief husband/wife intimacy scene are all implied, as well as the theme that a marriage has ended.  These are big and painful subjects that you may not wish our 13-year-old to see, but be assured that nothing is really depicted on screen as such.  But it is a part of the story and you may need to be prepared to explain these things in whatever manner you see fit.

Aside from this parental-oriented endorsement I can suggest this film to any adult who is looking for a textured story with excellent acting.  Do not compare this to Sixth Sense or any other recent ""surprise ending"" ghost movies because it is more a character and mood piece that a whodunnit or mystery.

The whole movie had an erie sense about it being that it was set in the countryside in post war time in a big castle type property with many many doorways in it.  Nicole Kidman has two children in the movie who can't be exposed to the light and this leads to doors being locked and curtains always drawn.  The caretakers in and of themselves are a bit freaky, but the main focus are the noises that are heard throughout the house coming from 'The Others'.  You really have to see this.  I can't say too much more without giving anything away, but it will scare you silly and everyone does an excellent job acting in this.  I love it and could see it quite a few times.

1309764,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.

On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.

One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.

Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.

The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.

Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.

It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.

This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.",1124582400,5,3586,4.859247135842881

Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a stunning Grace Kelly look alike. She's spectacular as the anxiety-ridden mother of two young children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). Both have a disease which afflicts them fatally if they're subjected to daylight. The time period is 1940s post WWII.

Grace takes the children to the family's dilapidated countryside mansion on one of the Channel Islands, to wait for her husband, Charles (Christoper Eccleston), to return from the war.

Continuous fog, no electricity, curtains always drawn, and every door to be shut and locked are only a few of the effects to flavor this story.

A large mansion needs servants, of course. In this story there are three strange servants, Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy).

1309870,4,B00003CYLJ,"A new variation of the classic history of ghosts - an enchanted, solitary and scary house-, returns to the big screen thanks to the excellent hands of director Alejandro Amenabar.

Nicole Kidman is Grace, mother of Anne and Nicholas, living in an isolated big house on a European island. The year is 1945 and Grace's husband is fighting against the Nazis in the final days of World War II.

The film begins when Grace receives three new servants - a governess, a gardener and a servant who will help at the mansion. Her previous servants went all away; we do not know why.

Grace gives few instructions to the help, but the most important thing to do is to keep closed all the doors whenever they change rooms. Apparently, Grace's children suffer a condition that does not allow them to receive sunrays.

Thus, the children live without going out, surrounded by shades and candlesticks. Her mother educates them, and many of their lessons are focused on religious values. The children, particularly Anna, feel the presence of other ghostly beings and their actions - doors and windows that are opened without touching them, pianos making music alone.

Grace is skeptical in the beginning and does not believe the stories, but it just a matter of time before she's convinced of the reality.

Gothic and terrifying, The Others is a thriller that creates a suggestive and dark atmosphere. Supported by the flawless characterizations of the actors and a wonderful script, this film does not rely on the special effects and fast-paced edition that usually defines contemporary terror movies. With genuine moments of terror, Amenabar has constructed a supernatural piece that causes great mental anguish.

Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance like the rigid and frustrating mother, constantly trying to stay in control of her emotions and to give a logical explanation to all the incomprehensible facts happening before her eyes. Deep down, we see the emotional collapse of a woman forced to accept the destruction of all her beliefs and values.

The children are equally memorable in their roles. Next to Kidman, they make us fear everything that hides behind each closed door, the shades rambling in the mansion and the secrets hiding in their corridors.

And it's finally when a chilling and unexpected ending is revealed, that The Others smashes us with its impressive weight, disturbing and making us revisit every moment, satisfied for have witnessed such a sublime work.",1115942400,,2478,5.039119804400978

1309872,4,B00003CYLJ,"I waited a long time to see ""The Others"" but only because it was playing at all of the worst, most inconvenient theaters in LA. I was waiting for the opportunity to see it on a somewhat respectable screen, to enhance my viewing experience. I fully believe that the screen and theater play a big part in the overall enjoyment of a film. If you see an OK film at a shoebox theater, you will likely report that the film was no good. If you see a bad film at a good theater, you will probably enjoy the film a little more. Over the Labor Day Weekend, I found myself on vacation, with a few hours on my hand, and `The Others' playing at a theater nearby. Unfortunately, the theater was one of the absolute worst that I have ever been in, so it may have colored my judgement a little. Note to theater goers: It is absolutely the most inconsiderate thing in the world to bring a cell phone to a movie theater and take calls during the film. It is inconceivably inconsiderate to take calls on a cell phone that lights up, casting shadows and a laser light show throughout the small, darkened theater. If this happened once, I could understand the mistake, but three or four times? Turn your damn cell phones and pagers off. People can call you back after the movie!

Now, about the movie...

Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) live in an old mansion on Jersey, an island off the English coast, during World War II. Grace, a puritanical woman, devoutly quoting the bible, teaches her children at home and in fact won't let them go into a room in which the sun is shining. Each child has a rare condition which can kill them if they are exposed to sunlight. Grace closes the curtains of each room as they move through, to protect them. Naturally, both Grace and the children become a little sick of being confined to the house. The perpetual fog outside does little to alleviate anyone's spirits. Grace and the children are also concerned about the whereabouts of the man of the family, Charles (Christopher Eccleston). He went off to fight in the war, but has not been heard from since, and the war has been over for at least a year. One day, three people show up on the doorstep to answer Grace's ad for domestic help. The previous three servants simply disappeared a week before. They are: Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan), Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes). About the same time, Grace and the children begin hearing noises.

""The Others"", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, is a haunted house film like they used to make, more similar to the original ""The Haunting"" or any other good horror film. The filmmaker relies on acting and storytelling to create an atmosphere of fright and horror, eschewing all CGI and gross-out tricks. How refreshing!

Nicole Kidman has now created two films in a row that any actor would like to be remembered for. In my eyes, this is a huge achievement. Previously, I couldn't stand her. Every role made her seem like an ice princess. Only ""To Die For"" showed any acting ability and even this role did nothing for her personality. Now with ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Others"", Kidman is showing both range and warmth, shattering previous conceptions of her. Both films show an actress with amazing ability.

Fionnula Flanagan, Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes are all very effective as the competent, but at times, mysterious help who arrive mysteriously. Their characters are most effective when they aren't revealing things to the audience. This was a mistake on Amenabar's part, as it reveals too much of their characters. It is always better to keep the audience in the dark for as long as possible.

Alakina Mann and James Bentley are especially effective as Grace's children. Never able to run and play, they seem perfect as they try to remain in their mother's good graces. As they talk of `mother's episodes', we don't know if they are simply telling tall tales or revealing something that we should really pay attention to.

The cinematography and set design help to create an atmosphere of confusion and dread. The fog surrounding the house serves to confine them further. As Grace fanatically moves from one room to the next, closing curtains, to shield the children from light, she herself creates an atmosphere of dread that we as the audience never seem to be able to escape.

A lot has been said of the `big twist' at the end. The less said about this, the better. Most reviews of this film compare the big twist to another very memorable big twist in another very memorable film. If you know what this previous twists is, you can pretty much figure out the twist in ""The Others"", which is too bad.

A lot has also been said about the film being too slow. I didn't find it slow at all. The suspense and tension build as we learn more about the story and the characters. I don't think it is necessary or relevant for every film to have quick or MTV-like editing. It wouldn't be appropriate to this story and I am thankful that they didn't use it here.

She hires several people to assist in care of the children and household, but these servants share a certain secret, protecting both Grace and the children from the reality of what is happening. The pace of the film is slow but measured, the characters convey the intensity and sometimes terror of what they feel; Nicole Kidman particularly ratchets up the level of intensity and territorialism, acting as a mother in the most protective and frenzied manner. The reality of the situation finally comes to light at the end, one of the psychological twists one expects from a particularly well done film.

The story centres on the character of Kidman as a neurotic WW2 wife, awaiting the return from war of her husband, Eccleston (who is superbly aloof, damaged and distant, he appears with great celebration and cruely dissapears with out trace, like a feather on the wind).

 Kidman has to protect her delicate Children in her huge and crumbling Country home. She is assisted by a trio of loyal Irish servants, Flannigan shines in her role, being at once comforting with an edge of menance. Sykes is almost unrecognisable from his earlier comic outings.

 The children are played with incredible plausibilty.

 Kidman has a struggle with unknown occurances in the house, or is perhaps her conscious which torments her so? The film is her journey of discovery and you are with her every step of the way until the light finally shines and dawn breaks, the classic plot twist is incredible to the point of breathtaking.

 Kid man is at her absolute tense and neurotic best here.

Set in the isle of Jersey during WWII the fog never seems to leave the environs: could it be that this mist is more than meets the eye... In a lovely old manor house it is only two children and a Mother along with the caretakers.  And then the haunting begins. Well chances are by now you at least have an idea of what happens.  This actually is a surprisingly good film on several levels and the DVD offers a great amount of extras making it a great value.  With several plot twists good dialogue and well nice cinematography, The Others, while not scary after the first viewing, is certainly an enjoyable film.

The actors in this film quite well portray their roles and the children are especially good.  It is so often that a film centered around children suffers from poorly acted juvenile roles.  Luckily this is not one of those films.  Nicole Kidman, who often carries the baggage of celebrity and her earlier roles into her characters, is surprisingly fresh and she pulls off the role of an English lady beautifully and she looks good too.  Beyond this her emotions seem believable and if you watch the film for the first time you will find her surprise and rage to be quite convincing.

I rate the movie as a solid four stars because it is somewhat intelligent and doesn't use a lot of cheesy ""shock scenes"" or any ridiculous CGI to keep the audience's interest the film is edited well and though there are parts that might seem slow their isn't much in the way of extraneous footage.  If you haven't yet seen this one certainly do so and if you have I think you will enjoy the many extras offered to you on the DVD version.  It is rare that there is a horror movie that is really good multiple times and this is one of them.

Nicole Kidman stars as the neurotic and deeply religious mother of two children who suffer from severe light sensitivity. She struggles to cope alone while her husband is missing, presumed dead, during WW2. Her only company is the children and three servants who arrived after she advertised for staff.

The settings are all dim and atmospheric and even outdoors everything is mist shrouded and unsettling. Problems start when the children start complaining there is someone else in the house, the 'others'. All is not as it seems with the servants either and they lend an air of uncertainty and, toward the end of the film, almost menace.

Highly strung, fanatically religious war widow Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives in an isolated big old house on the Channel Islands with her two children who both have a rare medical condition that makes all but the faintest light extremely harmful for them. And with three servants who turn up rather bizarrely on her doorstep. And perhaps that isn't all. For the children, especially her little girl, are starting to encounter some others, a little boy called Victor, his parents, an old lady.

It would  be misleading to call this a horror film. It's a real proper ghost story right bang in the tradition of those great literary ghost stories from Victorian and Edwardian England. It's consistently and wonderfully atmospheric and extremely chilling with some of the most brilliantly scariest scenes to be found in any movie: the bedroom scene with Victor at the curtains, the communion dress scene - if you've seen it you'll know what I mean; if not, you'll find out. And it passes the test most scary movies fail of staying scary on repeated viewings. Absolutely first class hide-behind-the-sofa or watch-through-the gaps-between-your-fingers material. Everything is just right. The deliciously creepy atmosphere is perfectly sustained by Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography and Amenabar's direction. (The preposterously talented Amenabar also wrote both the script and the music.) And the acting is stunning. Kidman is on her very top form. Fionnula Flanagan is perfect as the knowing old nanny Mrs Mills. And, boy oh boy, where did they find those children: James Bentley as Nicholas and utterly superb Alakina Mann as Anne? It's a wonderful film (and, I'm sorry people, but let's be serious, it's a hundred times better the The silly old  Sixth Sense.) M. R.

And, ""The Others"" is one of the best ""ghost films"" ever made, easily, right up there with the ORIGINAL 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" (not that terrible 1999 remake)... Atmosphere, mood and melancholia, a pervading feeling of sadness, seems to be what's really required to make a spooky story work--- without it, you have nothing. And ""The Others"" is awash in a sense of loss from the first scene.

I'm at the age where being scared in a movie isn't really likely to happen, but the dark, shadowy ponderences of ""The Others"" make this as absorbing as any film of its genre.

There is so much tension in every step that Grace takes while searching for Victor in that spooky house, that you will be on the edge of your seat, and the icy-cold music increases the chills. Kidman, in her best role to date, gives a remarkable performance, painting a portrait of fear, then horror, and madness.

1310235,4,B00003CYLJ,"Don't be fooled at the start where it says that it's 'set' in Jersey. It looks more to be set in the Yorkshire moors, but in reality it was set in Spain! Of course.
I'm not sure what I was expecting of this movie. When it started, it reminded me very much of Sixth Sense, and very much of M. Night Shyamalan's camera work, rather than Alejandro Amenabar. (Try saying THAT when you've had a few) As it went on, the whole fog outside the house, and not being able to escape the house/gardens reminded me of Beetlejuice - and again, the Yorkshire moors.
Unfortunately (no thanks to a Scottish newspaper) I found out the twist at the end, so I was expecting it, although it wasn't quite what I expected! So at least that was something.
I actually wondered after this movie was finished - and after finishing the discussion about what I didn't understand - how much of it was based on real life. As it was set towards the end of World War II, there were many wives wondering if they would see their husbands again - presuming they hadn't already received a telegram saying they were missing. How many wives would subsequently go mad, upon being trapped alone with children, without family around, and the fear of not being able to remarry? (Amazon, I am NOT giving anything away, so do not even start with me!) How many children had to put up with an overbearing, overprotective mother, while wishing they could see their father, and not understanding why he had to go and maybe not come back? Or wishing they could go out in the sunshine?
I must say, Nicole Kidman came off very well as a 40s wife - right down to the hairstyle, clothes, and manner. (Although I did find the hairstyle was a little too harsh) She was terrific as Grace, and had great chemistry with the children - although the girl was a little witch at times!
What didn't I get about this movie? The servants - how they couldn't come through the door, even after it was explained what they really were, but I suppose that's just too cartoonish maybe? - and the father coming back from the war. What was the point in Christopher Eccleston appearing in the movie for no apparent reason? But you could dig deeper into his whole appearing/disappearing act - and I could, but Amazon would get their red pen out. And I know he's come back from the war and everything, and he's seen some horrific things which he didn't want to talk about, but he could have at least given his wife a kiss! (In this day and age, I probably would have pounced on him, but this is in the 40s) But what I want to know is: did he remove the curtains?! Or did the servants? I found the mute servant's reason for being mute very strange. Surely if it happened to her, it could have happened to the rest of them, after they ""found out"".
The finale is terrific, and in the scenes leading up to it, I was really, really scared, and looking for someone to hold on to! (A friendly cushion kept me comforted kind of) After the film has finished, you look back on the film in a different light. Although I'll have to re-watch it many times before I get all the clues.
As a final note: don't be surprised if the sound isn't that great. I had this turned right up, and I still could only just hear what Nicole was saying. I thought this was a problem with my hearing. But I've read in other reviews, that people have had problems with the sound. So at least it's not me!",1087257600,,3394,4.338050314465409
1310311,3,B00003CYLJ,"This movie reeks of atmosphere, from the constant fog outside to the spartan grey interiors.  Did I mention the fog?  The director likes fog and in a special feature he shows how he created the fog effects.  In segment after segment he shows us.  It was sorta neat the first couple of times, but really it's just fog.  Like others, I wondered why there are two DVDs.  The extras don't really merit a full DVD.  I also had some problems with the sound.
Bearing all this in mind, the movie is good.  The ending didn't suprise me.  I figured it out about halfway through.  My advice-don't think and you will be suprised.  Kidman and the children give good performances.  This movie is entertaining, but not very rewatchable.",1086307200,,721,4.590551181102362

Anyone who wants a good scare, and a jump around each corner now and then, then you'll love this movie. Once you see it, you could imagine what it was like on the big screen. Of course, things are always better when they're on the big screen. Whenever another movie like this comes out, you don't want to miss it. You'll be sitting at the edge of your seat every minute of the time.
Grace (Nicole Kidman) is looking for a few honest hard working people to do the chores for the house. When Mrs. Mills, Mr. Tuttle, and a young girl named Lydia come along, they seem like perfectly normal people, except for the fact that Lydia just stopped talking one day. When Grace introduces them to her children Anne, and Nicholas; it turns out that the two have a very strange allergy to light. As the three new workers grow accustomed to the house, it seems that someone else has also come along with them. Strange noises can be heard in empty rooms. Anne says she keep seeing 4 people of a family, and Grace takes a look for herself and sees nothing, but hears very much. Who is really there, and what do they want?
Two days after watching this again, I bought it right away. I couldn't resist passing up a great suspense thriller as that. You're sure to have nightmares for quite a while. It's the price for being entertained. Don't think twice about it. The Others will surely send a chill up your spine.",1086048000,3,1480,4.289285714285715

1310314,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Other's is one of my favorite films of all time and my absolute favorite ghost movie. Eerie, suspenseful, emotionally involving, gorgeous to behold, and some of the most memorable ghosts ever. It includes the great elements of any classic gothic thriller: a large isolated old manor enveloped by an ominous blanket of fog, suspicious servants, a rather peculiar owner of the house, strange noises and unexplainable events, and an atmosphere that just reeks of doom and gloom. But the story and the characters make this a cut way above the usual and a tremendously rewarding movie watching experience.
The film kicks off with a mystery and the tension subtly grows from there. Three people show-up on the doorstep for employment before the Missus of the household had a chance to place an advertisement. hmmm...... As the new servants, they must learn all the rules of the house which include always insuring that they shut and lock each door behind them and never ever allowing even a smidgen of sunlight to sneak in from behind the heavy drapes of each room.  The house is also occupied by two small children who are vigilantly watched over by their firm and no-nonsense mother. Seems the little ones suffer from some strange rare disorder. hmmm.... Tension mounts as doors are left open (it wasn't the help - they swear it wasn`t), noises echo from empty rooms, the kids talk to invisible people, those sneaky servants cover up some graves they discover on the property, and a former member of the household returns only to quickly disappear.
I was pleasantly surprised by Nicole Kidman as the uptight mom. She gives an exquisitely layered performance of a woman rigid on the outside but terrified and lonely within. Her character is the heart and soul of this movie and Miss Kidman is impeccable.
Don't expect any splashy special effects, objects hurling threw the air and attacking people, or gruesome beasties running amuck. The Other's starts off as a whisper that softly builds until it climaxes with a scream of such agony you'll feel you've been kicked in the gut. That is just how good it is!",1085356800,4,2106,4.85

I want to watch it many times simply because after you view this movie once, you will want to watch it again in order to see it from different perspectives.",1082851200,2,444,4.582278481012659
1310316,1,B00003CYLJ,"Regrettably, I found this movie to be the most agonizingly ponderous ghost story that I have ever had the misfortune to view. My feelings about ""The Others"" are in such stark contrast to the many ovationary reviews that this motion picture received, that if I didn't know better, I would entertain the possibility that I had mistakenly viewed a differant movie of the same name.
The most disconcerting aspect of ""The Others"", in my opinion, was the incredible length that writer/director Alejandro Amenabar went to in order to keep the audience not merely guessing, but totally confused and disoriented. Pile onto a script that was peppered with an almost unprecedented degree of misdirection (no pun intended) an ending that was absolutely unpredictable even to the most prescient viewer and it is not surprising that this movie will fail to satisfy some viewers when Amenabar delivers his too-little, too-late payoff.
I would suggest that viewers looking for the kind of incredibly clever plot twist so adeptly crafted and flawlessly executed (and which delivers an emotional whallop)in ""The Sixth Sense"" look elsewhere. ""The Others"" take a stab at pulling off an equally brilliant coup de theater but misses by a wide margin.
After all, there would seem to be something of importance missing in a ghost story when the movie's most suspenseful moment had me cringing because I feared that Nicole Kidman would walk into a tree while navigating through a heavy stay-off-the-moors fog.
That was the real nailbiter for me. Not surprisingly the spectral fog scene leads to yet another completely unexpected plot development which in turn adds nothing to the narrative of the film, but which added considerably to my burden of already-existing confusion.
Put simply, the mystery of ""The Others"" can be reduced to a simple question: someone has lost it in Kidman's Gothic manor.
Who?
Has Kidman gone around the bend? Or is her totally annoying daughter who, despite living in a really freaky place in the middle of nowhere, and who seemingly remains unruffled by cohabitating with the undead, a bad seed herself hellbent on making Mom look psychotic?
By the timeI walked the torturous path Amenabar had lead me on for two hours and I found out what exactly had been going on  my confusion had escalated into vertigo and I was ready for ""Seinfeld"".",1082592000,10,2342,5.020565552699229

The darkly mesmerizing ambience is carefully captured with elegant photography, and all the actors here are notable.  I love seeing a film with great child acting.  The universal child-like fear of the unknown is the central theme throughout, and the two child actors here convey authentic fear.  But the standout performance here is from Nicole Kidman.  This is one of my favorites in her catalog.  There are many films in which she is stoic or comes across as an Ice Queen, fairly reluctant to show her emotional range.  But here she had me interested in her character on an emotional level; and how her character is dealing with the unusual, supernatural circumstances.  Like ""The Sixth Sense"" this film will look completely different during the second viewing.  This is a well-acted film with tight direction and a good script.

1310438,4,B00003CYLJ,"For all its pretenses, ""The Others"" is a basic ""Haunted House"" story.  As a film, it's pretty much B-Grade, but it's still very good.
The acting, the cinematography, the film score in ""The Others""- all are great, and contribute to the overall effect of the film.  I'm not that much of a devotee of ghost stories, so yes, the ending came as a surprise to me.  At least in these ways, the film worked.
Unfortunately, the script seemed to plod along slowly for the first an hour or so, and the series of events that held the story together seemed rather weak.  Since I borrowed the dvd from someone and didn't feel obligated to watch it in total, there were two or three junctures during the film that I was tempted to stop it and do something else, like the laundry.
Despite that, I watched the film in its entirety.  Gradually, ""The Others"" became interesting, and eventually, the truth behind the plot was revealed for a surprise twist.
Viewers will probably contrast this film to ""The Sixth Sense"", which would be a fair comparison, since each has a peculiar point of view.  The only thing that I will say is that I thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was a much leaner film.  Even when I finished watching ""The Others"", it seemed to me that there were too many extra elements that didn't really contribute to the story's eventual resolution (i.e. the old woman in the child's first communion dress - What was that about?)
Is this a film that I would recommend?  Yes.

Eerie, unpredictable, creepy film that held my attention for the entire length.  It is a smart horror film that boasts a strong cast, which is not something I can say for most horror films.  Nicole Kidman does an amazing job portraying her well-meaning but cold and slightly mad mother living with her children way out in the countryside trying to figure out what is going on with her home.  I can understand how people who post negative things about this movie say ""it's boring"".  That's because the average person is an impatient ""give me the damn twist now now now!"" kind of viewer who needs instant gratification.

By the time THE OTHERS was over, I was bolt upright in bed and feeling the chills, not from my cold but from a perfectly crafted ghost movie. I hadn't felt so absorbed and horrified (in a good sense) since I'd read Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS or James' TURN OF THE SCREW. And I think it's for the same reason a previous reviewer had mentioned: this movie has the feel of a 19th century ghost story and not a 20th century horror story. Not a single drop of blood is spilled. No skeletal or decaying corpse-like spectre threatening violence prowling around here. These ""others""--from the other side of life--are an unknowable entity. Nicole Kidman's character is terrified by what the others don't tell her about themselves (once she believes they exist). She doesn't know what they want, and the perceived consequences of that are what fuel the second half of the film. This, combined with the fact that her children have been in touch with the others, yet they can only tell her mother so much, keeps her frustration and vigilance at fever pitch.
The gloomy setting, the inscrutible domestic staff, and the constant bickering of the children all add to the suspense.
This is an example of quality horror film making. It's the situation, the acting, the lighting, and of course a story with substance that keep it going. This is a profoundly moving ghost story with great performances.",1078531200,3,1585,4.664285714285715

She does well in this film as an overprotective mother who is obsessed with teaching her children Bible lessons and ironically, also keeping them from the light.  The light of the sun, that is, because oddly enough, these two children are allergic to sunlight and exposure is sure to have dire consequenses.  The film moved pretty slowly, but got really creepy in some parts (photos) and looked like it may be a nice horror flick.  Unofortnately, near the end, the director decides he needs to have a weird plot twist.  I don't want to give anything away, but for me, it was a disappointment.  In any case, the first half of the movie is quite good, and it is still worth a see.",1077926400,,717,4.476923076923077

All fine and well, but the story cannot support such large themes since it is trite, manipulative, and is so concerned with setting us up with its trick ending.  Children may be frightened at some of the faux horror, but if you let them watch it till the end, they'll fall asleep and wake up as liberals.  You been warned!

1310444,3,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a good movie that unfortunately can not hold out its 104 minute running time because of the confines of the twist - that we have seen before. Comparisons will be made to certain other horror twist vehicles that did the circuit around the same time as this movie.
The problem with these twist films is that the entire weight of the picture is balancing on that twist. This means that the film can not really extend past those boundaries of what that has to offer. In one scene Nichole Kidman leaves her home only to be enveloped in a fog and she must return back to where she came from. That pretty much sums up what is on display here.
Nichole Kidman plays a somewhat wealthy land owner whose husband has not returned from the war, her kids can not go near sunlight, her servants have left her and she is trying to keep everything together. When most of the film has played itself out to establish everything in the first twenty minutes it does not really go anywhere else until the climax. The film mostly repeats itself - Kidman acts desperately to keep control, the new servants act strange, the house is haunted. The material is recycled over and over again but this is what we usually expect from films that hang onto that twist as the final affirmation that will effectively blow out our candle.
Overall the twist does work but is nothing that you have not seen before if you have seen other types of these themes. The acting from Kidman is quite good but everyone else is a little under par including Christopher Eccleston's performance. It all looks very stage-like and has more television appeal than DVD or the cinema screen. In fact it works better as something you switch onto after seeing the news. This would be a more apt market niche for it than mainstream cinema and it plays better as a Television movie. It is more along that ""quality"" of film making than what the A-list leading lady suggests.
This is a good horror yarn and a nice Ghost story, but not spectacular cinema, powerhouse performing or the brilliant film as some may tout. It is just good but nothing new or original. It does boost a few scares but these can be handled by most teenagers or anyone above the 12 age group category.... maybe even some people below that age. It really depends on your kids but I know plenty that watched it and enjoyed it and still went to sleep that night. There is no blood or violence in this horror movie which is good.

Problem is, you have likely seen The Sixth Sense, and remember it, which makes the denouement of The Others so painlessly guessable that it's a bit of a gyp. You catch on fairly early that someone is not what they seem, but then you spend an hour restraining yourself from hitting the fast-forward to find out the answer.

Besides, her daughter keeps telling these creepy stories and playing heavy pranks on her little brother... but as the movie moves forward, it is clearer that they might not be just pranks and creepy stories.
Alejandro Amenbar achieves a great movie through a clever use of environmental elements. The fog, the art of the house, the furniture; but the most fundamental part of the fear comes from Nicole Kidman's perfect performance as a stressfull mother, whose beliefs come to ground as the world of the living gets mixed up with the dead's.

1310528,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a riveting and darkly menacing thriller, yet, during the course of the film, not a drop of blood is shed and no one dies.  It is a reflection on the talent of director Alejandro Amenabar that small things, like a door slamming shut in one's face or a ghostly hand upon one's cheek are far more frightening than any amount of special effects that films in this genre are increasingly becoming reliant upon.  A sense of claustrophobia is introduced from the outset by the thick fog surrounding the house in which most of the action takes place, and also by the permanently closed curtains and doors that prevent sunlight from brightening the rooms.
In this house the light must always be contained, because the two young children (who live there with their mother) are photosensitive, and exposure to daylight will make them very ill.  But it would seem that the family and their three somewhat mysterious servants are not the only inhabitants of the darkened house.  Footsteps are heard, doors are opened, curtains are removed, but search as they may, nobody can find the perpetrators of these actions.  And it would seem that whatever these beings are, they bear an ever-increasing amount of malevolent ill will towards the family.
The film's conclusion is unexpected, even for those viewers who have managed to second-guess an earlier plot twist prior to its revelation.  The surprise factor is at least partly due to the outstanding performances by the cast; special mention must be made of Alakina Mann, who is a young actress with a very bright future.  This film is an example of outstanding cinematic production, and to maximise its impact, it is best watched in a darkened room.",1069545600,4,1699,4.858131487889273

The story is about Grace (an amazing performance by Nicole Kidman) who hires three servants to help take care of her huge mansion and two children who live in darkness because they are diagnosed as photosensitive (they can not be in any strong light). Grace's husband has been gone for quite a while, presumed dead in the war. So, at first, she is glad to have the extra help around, although her character always stays on the cold side. But after a few days of the servants living in her house, strange things begin to happen and Grace finds herself fighting for the safety of her children and to keep her sanity!

1310532,5,B00003CYLJ,"I come to this ghost story from two perspectives; on one hand I am a movie lover, and a spooky movie lover in particular, and, from that perspective I have to say that this is a real nifty piece of work. It is so refreshing to see something so free of guts, gore, and barbarism. There are no ""Hellraisers"" here, no Freddy Krueger, no Jason Vorhees, and no Michael Myers. No FX sequences included simply to shock and revulse and ""push the envelope of edginess"" (buzzwords schlock producers use to rationalize their sick ""tastes"" as being ""artistic vision"". Go figure).  This movie has characters, relationships, situations,and a STORY to tell. And it does a stylishly grand job of doing so. There is tension, puzzlement, mystery, and unease throughout it...and it all works. And the solution to the mystery of the ""otherness"" of ""The Others"" is a stunner. A plot device that truly turns the viewers' perception of who is who and what is what on its head.
  Marvelous movie. Well mounted. Well acted. Well told.
  ...and a bit more than that. A very ACCURATE sort of movie. The screenwriters here have really done their ""homework"", so to speak. I said earlier that I came at this film from two perspectives, only one of them being as a film fan. The other perspective is as an off-and-on ghost hunter (yes, tri-field meters, laser thermographic guns, etc.,etc.). And from that perspective I must note that this movie runs VERY close to the truth re: my own observations on the ""thought processes"" of ""ghosts"": which is, that VERY few of the ""real things"" believe FOR A MINUTE that they ARE ghosts, or that they are even DEAD. And they regard YOU as a real nut case if you try to convince them OTHERWISE. They DON'T want to HEAR it. So, without trying to spill too much of the storyline of this movie to those who have never seen it, I will only say this; there is a lot more paranormal VALIDITY here than there is pure hokum dreamed up in the off-kilter mind of a paid screenwriter.
  Watch ""The Others"". Enjoy ""The Others"". There's a great deal more substance here than anything you'll find on Elm Street. In your nightmares or otherwise.",1068422400,,2137,4.62269129287599
1310533,4,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman is astonishing in this film. Honestly, I never thought of her as more than a pretty face, but this film demonstrates her talent. She plays a mother trying to shelter her children from light, because they have a rare condition that makes ordinary sunlight blistering. (There really is a condition like this, by the way.) Her husband is missing in action in WWII, so for help with the children, and her large house, she hires three servants who oddly dress as though they just stepped out of the turn of the last century.
Light functions almost as a character in this film. Light hurts the children, light fails to reveal the strangers who may or may not be hiding in the shadows. Light lurks outside each door, waiting for a chance to catch someone unaware, and pounce. The cinematography is excellent, following the mother from room to room, brilliantly capturing her frantic near-panic.
The child actors here are unprodigious and ingenuous. They hardly seem to be acting. It's a great relief from the latest vehicle for whatever child actor Hollywood is trying to impose on the viewing public.
At its heart, this is a ghost story. I initially feared the film might harbor didacticism, but it does not. It's here to entertain, and that is all. Jut don't try to second guess it, or you will cheat yourself out of some of the fun. There are a few jolts that you don't want to see coming.

1310534,4,B00003CYLJ,"This film has all the essential qualities of a classic ghost story. It really comes down to the fact that if a ghost story is told well, it will scare you. ~The Others~ is extremely well made, each scene is crafted to ensure it evokes a particular mood or feeling in the most subtle ways. Director Alejandro Amenaber, (Open your Eyes) is a Spanish craftsman who has a gift for telling a story with subtlety, nothing is ever apparent, but is hinted at through the visuals and clues in the dialogue. Personally, the in-your-face horror stories do nothing for me. I find Eddie Krugger, for example, hilarious. What is horrifying, for me, is subtle irrational behaviour. Grace (Nicole Kidman) at the opening of the film instructs the servants to ensure they close and lock every door in the house as they move through them. As she believes the sunlight is dangerous to her two children, she is absolutely adamant that the light must be contained. Suddenly our normal sensibilities are reversed, the light is the enemy and the darkness must be secured at any cost. I find this sort of thing more disturbing than 'Jason' rising from the depths and decapitating a few unlucky teenagers. Subtlety is the key for a good ghost story.
Nicole Kidman is a versatile actor who possesses a huge range. She has shown that she can play just about any character and play it with believability. In this film her neurotic behaviour is honest to the point of irritability. She is also an attractive and elegant woman and a pleasure to view on the big screen. Her performance in this film is quite good, but Fionnula Flanagan as the head housekeeper stole the show. Her expressions throughout the film would constantly put me off balance - the characters intentions are never clear until the end. She plays a veneer of kindness with a hint of evil bubbling just under the surface. Again, this was a subtle performance which created a huge impact. In fact, all the performances from the cast, particularly the children, were first rate.
This is a good film to have in your collection because it can be seen more than once, as there are subtle aspects in the story that will be missed on a single viewing. The mark of a good ghost story or any tale is its light touch and unexpected twist. This film has both.",1067040000,2,2285,4.630541871921182

1310648,5,B00003CYLJ,"With the onset of big special-effect production houses like ""Industrial Light & Magic,"" and ""Dreamworks"" there have been few movies in this genre of macabre horror that haven't capatilized on using visual imagery to achieve scares.  Monsters are more foul, more hideous than ever, and with the use of computers, almost anything can be created.  And yet, in a twist of irony, it is these very same effect houses that have diminished our ability to be scared by de-sensitizing us to the macabre by making it so readily available.
This is why some of the more inventive directors in Hollywood are again turning to more traditional means of filmmaking, focusing on camera effect, light and shadow, and most importantly, story-telling, to achieve bigger screams and better thrills.  ""The Others"" is a prime example of such a film.
Set in the long halls, and lofty rooms of an old English manor, the story tells of a woman and her ill children, living alone and abandoned on an island in the throws of a world war.  The woman, played brilliantly by Nicole Kidman, is met by a trio of housekeepers who arrive unexpectedly at her doorstep.  She invites them in and hires them immediately, explaining the house has been left in disarray since the last set of servants disappeared very unexpectedly.
It isn't long before the story really starts to build momentum.  The children, who suffer from an illness that makes sunlight lethal to them, move about the house in darkness, each room's windows carefully covered to avoid exposure.  Relationships begin to develop between the family and the servants, and as they do, so too does the house begin to fill with the sound of the ""others"" who seem to have taken residence.
The story is very simple, almost linear in its development, but its strong focus on developing its characters a layer at a time provide more scares, more edge-of-your-seat than any effect could.  Ironically, there are no obvious special-effects in this film.  It is the masterful use of light and shadow, odd camera angles, and a beautifully written soundtrack that make this film both frightening and genuinely interesting to watch, right up to the suprise ending in the final minutes of the film.",1063238400,3,2207,4.89544235924933

The sadness of Kidman's character's situation permeates throughout the film, giving a dream-like, nostalgic quality... and at the end of the movie, you'll see why you're in this mood. This is about as good as movies get.
PS - Don't watch it thinking it's a ""horror"" movie. It's not. It's more of a thriller, with a few clever suprises, but it's not made to make you scream your head off. It's a sophisticated film that explores loss, grief, and desperation.",1062720000,,630,4.633928571428571

Whatever, nothing can quite prepare you for the spectacular ending (which I won't give away). Let's just say that it had an impact on me.
Nicole Kidman is excellent as a housewife caring for her two children while her husband is away apparently fighting for the War. When everything starts to unfold, we learn that this is not the case.
THE OTHERS is an incredibly sad tale, and Kidman's performance is such that you really do feel sympathy for her character. The frustation, the heartache ....

1310652,4,B00003CYLJ,"I think it was after viewing The Others that I reached the conclusion that although there's something about Nicole Kidman that I don't like, she keeps appearing in interesting films. I had low expectations for this film after reading some of the early reviews. A year of so after its initial release, I finally rented it one evening when I  couldn't find anything else interesting at the video store. Early on in the story, I  began to find myself pleasantly surprised that this seemed to be exceeding my expectations - the characters, setting, atmosphere, cinematography, and script were weaving a well-crafted old-fashioned period supernatural/psychological drama. The film continued to hold my attention until the widely publicized ""surprise"" ending, which I found satisfying if not particularly surprising. No violence or gore, but a bit too creepy for some younger viewers; fun to watch by candlelight on a foggy night.",1059436800,2,924,5.236486486486487
1310767,3,B00003CYLJ,"My post-virginal viewing of this film was surprisingly entertaining. Usually, horror movies are never as scary as they are on first viewings. Okay, while this film isn't frightening enough to be considered a masterpiece of horror, the fact that it is effective at all, considering my familiarity with it, is really cool.
Nicole Kidman's portrayal of a housewife raising two kids, at first, feels over-done; over-the-top. But during my last viewing, I began to realize that maybe writer/director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar intentionally convinced Kidman to ham it up.
You see, Kidman's character, named Grace, has been raising her two kids all alone, ever since her husband, who has been ghost for a long time, went off to war. Grace is sexually-deprived, over-whelmed by the kids, and claustrophobic (she never leaves the house).. and maybe some other unhealthy adjectives. If THE OTHERS makes a statement about anything, it is that a woman, or single parent, should not have to carry the burden of raising children alone.
This is pretty similar to Jack Torrence's conflict in THE SHINING. Deprived of the ""finer"" things in life: sex, alcohol, friends, an exit out of the house, etc... Jack ultimately went cabin crazy. You know the story. If not, you should see it, along with this film. They're, like, the brother and sister of each other, giving male and female perspectives on the experience of deprivation.
THE OTHERS is also pretty similar to the Kubrick film in the way that it scares its audience. Many of the film's most chilling moments happen right before your eyes, or through suggestion. You hear sounds, and then you hear nothing.. and then the goosebumps arise. Then you get defensive, preparing yourself for the sudden entrance of a horrible being. Wickedly, the film toys with you. Sometimes you're shocked with images, and other times you're not. Without revealing anything, there's a scene involving a painting, hiding in the darkness. I swear, that image gets me every damn time that I watch this picture.
Also worthy of note is Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's daughter, Anne. She's totally convincing as the older sibling who gets a kick out of frightening her younger brother. Fortunately, she even sends chills up our spines, with her suggestions of eerie things behind the curtain, or right beside you, breathing on you, waiting for the right moment to scare the living daylights out of you.",1059004800,5,2414,5.052631578947368
1310768,4,B00003CYLJ,"THE OTHERS is a great, spooky film.  It does not try to be a slasher/scary film.  Instead, it is a classic (and classy) ""haunted house"" movie. THE OTHERS does more scaring with sound and implied camera angles than a slasher flick will ever do.  Its haunted house atmosphere (fog, creaky floors, old rooms) is spooky.  One effective scene involves a glowing, ghostly face that ends up being a painting.
The tone is set right away.  Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, shows the new servants around the house.  There are some weird house rules!  Every door must be closed and locked before the next one is opened.  The curtains must be drawn at all times.  Her children are photosensitive, you see, and could erupt in sores and smother to death if exposed to daylight.  Weird.  Kidman plays all her scenes with a wide-eyed neurotic energy - Grace is on the edge!  One wonders how Kidman the actress sustained this type of frenetic energy over the course of the shoot?  She's really good here.
THE OTHERS telegraphs its ending by dropping some clues along the way.  I had it figured out. The execution of the revealing scene is very good, though, and still manages to surprise you.
I jumped out of my couch several times.  The sound design is particularly good -- there's one scene where the thud-thud-thud of a ""ghost"" upstairs will shake you out of your chair!

1310769,5,B00003CYLJ,"Don't miss this jem of a movie if you are intelligent and want some food for thought!! You may think that this is a typical ghost-type story as you begin to watch, but think again. Don't expect to be terrorized, and don't expect blood and gore, or even slash and bash..but do expect to be challenged mentally. Nicole Kidman plays the mother of two children who are photo-sensitive and must be perpetually in the dark, and her character is very prone to migraines. They are supposedly waiting for the father to return from the war. You know as the movie progresses that things are not as they seem, but you WILL be surprised at the end of the movie. This movie is not at all predictable. Nicole's character is very committed to her religion, and if you listen carefully, a lot of beliefs are called into question. What is the truth about life and death? And do we really know much of anything? At the end of the movie, Nicole admits to her children that she doesn't know anything and says ""I'm no wiser than you are"". Each and every character is marvelous, especially the one who plays Ann, a sassy little girl with a mind of her own. The one who plays Mrs. Mills is just about as wonderful a character as you could imagine, such a kindly and honest woman with great strength. Nicholas is a boy in denial about what has happened to him because of his great love for his mother. And Nicole's character is played to perfection.

1310770,5,B00003CYLJ,"In my opinion ""The others"" is the apotheosis of thrillers. I don't understand why people say it's a bad, boring and predictable movie, when it's clearly not. I'll make a little list of what thriller movies supposedly should have, and then I'll contradict the major complaints about this movie. Let's see:
1) Haunted house - all good thrillers should have a closed environment, or induce a claustrophobic feeling in the viewers. ""The others"" have, and ""The others"" do. This movie's location is a mansion in a british island, always surrounded by a gray, wet, spooky mist. And the fact that all courtains have to be closed at all times gives the plot this dark and claustrophobic aura. Perfect.
2) Spooky characters - The servants and the husband who's back from the war display no emotion at all, and leave the viewer with a feeling that they know a lot more than what they disclose to the main characters.
3) Strange children - Two children who are fotosensitive and who cannot leave their house. On top of that, they start to ""receive"" the visite of another, invisible child.
4) A beautiful woman - Hitchock always cast a beautiful woman on his films. It grips the attention, at least of the masculine part of the audience. In fact, Nicole Kidman, as the mother of the children and lady of the house, looks so much like Grace Kelly that I can only see it as a homage to the great master of suspense. She's incredibly beautiful, and very talented as well, as the paranoid mom and harsh mistress of her servants.
5) Pianos, paintings and furniture - The classic scenes where the piano plays by itself, spooky paintings and manequins, furniture changing places and the dreary curtains.
There's more, but I think it's enough. Now on to the list of complaints.
A) ""The plot is dull and boring"". - If you wanted to get spooked every 30 seconds, then go to a Virginia forest alone without an electric light at one in the morning. ""The others"" provides few junp scenes, but when they come they are good. And if you can't enjoy the plot of a movie as a means to create an atmosphere, than go watch Freddy Kruger, Jason - Friday 13, etc.
B) ""The children and the mother are annoying"" - Of course they are. They're children. And the mom's a total paranoia freak. She lost her husband in the war. Her house is haunted. Her children are sick. She couldn't be smiling and picking flowers in the garden all the time.
C) ""I could see the final twist coming from a mile away"" - No you couldn't. If ten people say that, eight are lying. They just want to be cool. The final twist is very good and the whole movie builds greatly up to these final moments.
D) ""The sixth sense is much better"" - Why? What is so different about these two movies? Pay close attention. In ""The sixth sense"" there are very few jumps scenes also, and the whole movie is very slow too, not to mention other similarities.
So, ""The others"" has everything a good thriller should have, and add to that the competent direction of Alejandro Amenabar and the always imposing presence of Nicole Kidman. A very effective movie, that won't easily be away from your mind once you see it. In fact, just to raise all this discussion already is proof of a good production.

It is about a young mother named Grace, whose husband has gone off to war, and she is stuck in her huge, old mansion with her two light-sensitive children.

The 2 women and 1 man that show up are a little odd, and...well, you'll understand once you see it about 2 times.

1310775,5,B00003CYLJ,"On the mist-shrouded, half-abandoned island of Jersey, in an old but beautiful house, waits Grace and her two children for the husband that went off to war and never came home. For a woman living alone in the those days with two children to care for and a missing husband, the stress and fear would have been terrible. But for Grace, the situation is even more dire - her children Anne and Nicolas are photosensitive, and will die if exposed to any light much brighter than a lamp. Therefore the light must be contained - each door must be shut and locked before the next one is opened, and the curtains in each room are constantly drawn whenever the children move about. Usually they are confined to one room, and the restrictive claustrophobia is almost suffocating, for both them and Grace. But to make things even worse, the servents of the house have disappeared inexplictedly in the night, without even collecting their wages a few ago, leaving Grace literally stranded.
Why they left is unknown, but the viewer gets the sneaking suspicion that it was Grace herself, with her rules and regulations that border on obsessive complusion, and her devout Catholic upbringing. However, this problem is soon cleared up with the appearence of three new servents that come to the house - Bertha Mills, Edmund Tuttle and a young mute girl named Lydia. It soon becomes clear however, that there is more to these three that mets the eye - Grace's letter requesting new servents never reached the post office - so what are they doing there?
Mystery follows mystery as strange happenings begin to arise in the house. Grace's daughter Anne speaks of a young boy named Victor, much to the terror of the younger Nicolas, and though the footsteps and opened doors are first blamed on the servents and the children, soon Grace cannot deny that there are others in the house with them.
Nicole Kidman puts on an exquistite performance as the ridgid and strict Grace, gradually becoming unwound by the impossible occurances happening around her. Though many may dislike her strict and often harsh nature toward the children, the director compensates with several softer moments, and it is very clear throughout the plot that she desparately loves both of them. Her entire personality is ruled by circumstance. It is clear that like the servents, she too harbours a secret, as her children keep mysteriously alluding to ""that day"" when supposedly their mother went mad, and who wouldn't under such dreadful and stressful circumstances.
The director has struck gold with the casting of Anne and Nicolas. Rather than simply being the children, whose only role is to look scared, they are fundamental to the story and to Grace's state of mind. The eldest, Anne is a real joy - rebelling against her mother continually, first in her outright disbelief in what her Biblical mother preaches to her, and secondly in her stalwart insistence that she is *not* telling her brother scary stories, but there is in fact someone else in the house - warning her that they're threatening to take down the curtains... Mischievous and often malicious, she is closer to ""the others"" than anyone else in the house, much to the upsetting of little Nicolas. Devoted to his mother, yet needful of the presence of his sister, he is shy to his sister's confidence, and fearful to her bravery in regard to the ghosts.
""The Others"" was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, and he brilliantly brings the spooky atmosphere to life, showing us both the grandeur of the house and the suffocatingly restrictive way of living inside it. In many ways the house itself is a major character, and when it comes to the frightening moments...lets just say I have never been so terrified of the mere sound of footsteps on the second floor.
The ending is quite ambiguous, and as the credits role, you're not entirely sure if its a happy ending or not. Instead it is melancoly and hazy, which given the overall atmosphere of the movie is a perfect ending, but left me with more questions than answers. The two main questions raised are what the characters themselves ask. To not give away the story, I can't tell you who is speaking them, but they are ""Why do you remain in this house?"" and ""What does all this mean?"" It presents a new, and not entirely welcome slant on the nature of death, and it would seem by the end that the ghosts are trapped in the house via the fog for all time.
Although I adore this movie, and don't mind at all its slow but constant pace, I have to admit that it's not for everyone. My father watched it with me, and though he admitted that it was very clever, he found the only frighting thing about it was the sight of a mentally fragile woman running about the house with a shotgun! If you are a gore and blood person, this movie won't impress you, though if you're imagination is like mine, and you find that what you *don't* see is more terrifying than what you *do*, here is the movie for you.",1055980800,2,4975,4.686857142857143

The result is a family that lives a dark, dreary, yet highly-strung existence.  The father went away to WWII, and did not return when it ended.  One senses throughout that each character is waiting for something to happen--something to break the horrid state they find themselves in.  Into the picture come three domestic servants, responding to an advertisement to replace the three that left suddenly.  These new helpers are quiet, and mysterious.  They seem to know much, but are careful to let fate take its course.  The mother soon discovers that her new domestic servants had not responded to a published help wanted notice, because the postman never picked up the request.
Kidman plays her deeply conflicted character with a combination of force and poise that is amazing.  The children also do earily well--as do the servants.  Even the father, who plays an important, but small role, falls into place with sublety.
Bottom line:  The Others compares favorably with such movies as Sixth Sense and Vanilla Sky.  The brilliantly created atmosphere, along with the movie's ability to help me overcome my hatred of darkly lit movies earns this creation five stars!",1054425600,2,1279,5.190243902439025

However, with the backing of the Hollywood machine, he has gome step further and produced a ghost film of pure gold.

1310856,5,B00003CYLJ,"The movie has really scary moments, achieved in good taste without excessive gore and violence. I did not see it in the theaters, but watching in on a big screen tv is scary enough. All this is true, even given the fact that I knew what was really going on, because I inadvertently overheard the plot of this movie on ""Mad TV.""
Nicole Kidman, as usual, does an outstanding job of merging with her character and being totally believable. The British accents are unobtrusive enough to make the characters easy to listen to. The dark atmosphere and the suspense work flawlessly to achieve their desired effect.
An upper class, seemingly emotionally stable--even if a bit neurotic--and caring widow, is taking care of two children in a remote mansion, following the end of World War II. The children are intelligent, but subject to a mysterious illness--they break into sores when exposed to normal amounts of light. Apart from this strange ailment, everything looks proper, until domestic help arrives. These servants may seem creepy and suspicious, but they simply create the appropriate atmosphere and delay, for a while, the revelation about the emotional breakdown and murder that are the real ghostly (and ghastly) story of this movie.",1053820800,,1237,5.0390243902439025
1310857,5,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman got some fine notices when she first appeared in DEAD CALM and FLIRTING, but she pretty much disappeared into dull girlfriend roles during the years of her marriage to Tom Cruise. She did garner critical attention for her funny comic turn in TO DIE FOR, but the part closely approximated the press's conception of her (as scheming arm-candy) and it wasn't until this fine thriller by Alejandro Almenabar came out in 2001 that people began treating her seriously. (Although she was nominated for her first Best Actress Oscar for MOULIN ROUGE--which came out earlier that year--, it wasn't until the fine notices for her work in THE OTHERS that people started taking her role in MR more seriously.)
Even without Kidman's splendid turn as the neurotically brittle Grace, the mistress of the mysterious Isle of Jersey mansion where she lives during WWII with her small children, this Gothic chiller would be a real treat. The pace is purposefully slow, and the colors are all watery and muted: the gigantic house surrounded by fog and greenery seems like something out of a Willkie Collins sensation novel. Grace lives in the mansion bereft of her husband (who has left her to go to War) and servants (who recently left Grace and her children on a  traumatic day in the recent past we hear referred to again and again in the film ). Her eldest child, the willful Anne (Alakina Mann, in a memorable child's performance), is reporting encounters with a frightened and angry family of ghosts living in the house with them. It is into this that on one day a trio of strangers, led by Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan) approach Grace in the mansion looking for work... but it seems they know this house already from before...
Many who saw this film in 2001 were disappointed in that its ending reminded them too much of another popular ghost film. But this is unfair, especially given that THE OTHERS started filming before the other film had been released. It's a superbly scary Gothic, and offers three superlatives for the three women at its core: FLannagan, Mann, and the amazingly complex Kidman.",1053475200,3,2104,4.82825484764543
1310858,5,B00003CYLJ,"After his two most brilliant movies (""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes"", which ""Vanilla Sky"" was based off) Chilean-born Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar comes back with an eye-opener that will keep you at the edge of your seat. In a non-conventional script that reminds us of what a brilliant writer he is, he presents a family of three, a mother (Kidman in another impeccable performance) and her two kids, ""trapped"" inside a house, where the curtains must remain closed at all times to shut the light out, since the kids suffer from a critical condition that makes them fatally alergic to it. As three new servants knock on their door to offer their services, their lives take a weird twist that not even the savviest moviegoers can expect.
The brilliance of Amenabar as writer and director is complemented by the music (also composed by him), which helps to set the tone for the normally dark shots. In the end, the movie opens up (like Amenabar has us used to) a whole can of worms, where life and death are inextricably tied to each other, and viewers are struck with the realization that truly we as humans have not yet learned our lesson as to how to cope with the deaths of our loved ones, much less when they happen under tragic circumstances.

1310990,4,B00003CYLJ,"I was surprised at how much I liked this film.  The manic slightly claustrophobic anxiety to the whole thing.  Nicole Kidman is an actress I enjoy because of her versatility and the fact that she always seems to have something going on underneath her performances.  Like someone who is intelligent but may be too wrapped up in one focus.  Thats how several of her performances have struck me.  Which is a good thing.  Conveying both intelligence and life of character as well as a sub-mood is very skilled.  The twist here again is that her and her family are ghosts who haven't accepted death, much like the Sixth Sense but this movie goes a little further in the characters being disturbed.
I think that there tends to be a trend in consciousness or idea-streams in movies.  Lately it's been about consciousness---The Sixth Sense, the Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, big movies about the reality of existence, of what is alterable and what isn't.  I read somewhere that Hollywood/films are a projection of teh masses consciousness-------so when there are more violent movies and so on thats what we as a culture are experiencing on a level.  I think this can be seen with the proliferation of war movies and their ilk and at the same time these films about metaphysics, the ones that ask existentialism questions are fascinating as well.  I enjoy them because it does seem like there is challenge to them, a challenge to be more than just cookie cutter films.
Also what I will credit this film with is that it completely avoids being gorey, all of the violence is languaged/explained, not shown, which ratchetts up the tension even more.  We've all seen the horror pics of blood and gore, but psychological tension is much harder to create and maintain and pull off satisfyingly.",1048118400,,1787,4.803921568627451
1310991,5,B00003CYLJ,"I just finished watching The Others, a movie that had been sitting on my shelf, borrowed from my parents collection, since around the time of Thanksgiving.  The sky outside was overcast, the lights all off in the apartment, leaving enough grey illumination to see by.  The chill of the tail end of winter permeates the house, convincing me to pull myself under a blanket, and the cats have chosen to sleep.  This, I imagine, has to have been one of the perfect settings in which to watch The Others.
Without anyone else around, your breath matches to that of the characters on screen, and you get wrapped up in the tightly ritualized life in the house of Grace (Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicolas.  The entire family has been stricken by the bizarre allergy to sunlight, although it is only the children that are directly injured by the rays.
The movie develops at its own pace, a slow patterning as new layers are added to the mystery, and new inklings of terror are hinted at.  It is a movie to be watched when one in unconcerned about time in the real world, so that one can fall into the pendulum of the film's own cadence.

This movie-The Others-throws that quote into a wholly different light. Wrestling mentally with what this quote means to the movie as well as what the movie says to the quote is truly worthwhile.
The Others as a film is hard to review without spoiling the whole darn thing. So-some personal observations:
This movie has a tiny but excellent cast with Ms. Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, and Alikina Mann in particular being downright outstanding in their roles. The movie would not have worked without the awesome performances each of them gave. The production looks like what I have always imagined Henry James' Turn of the Screw to have looked like (creepiness personified).
Great ghost stories are one of the rarest finds in any kind of literature. Even fewer workable ghost stories find their way to film. The Others is one of them-I recommend it highly.",1047340800,,1018,4.7897727272727275

When I watched it for the first time, the suspense was baffling till the very end. Then over the months I have watched it many times and each time it has been a different experience.
This is not a movie with ""scary"" animations, chilling screams,or one of those cheap ones that comes out by dozens every halloween. This is in a different plane all together.

1310997,4,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" does what no suspense/thriller/horror/drama hybrid of the recent decades has been able to do, instill fear and a genuine sense of the unsettling without resorting to gore, guts and gruesomeness to get its shock value across.  The story concerns itself with a young mother of two children who is hold up in a grand English manor waiting for WWII to be over.  However, when she employs three peasants who used to work the same land some time before, the scares really start to add up.  There's noises in the attic, shadows on the wall and ""the others"" - a set of disturbing (?) that wreak terror on the entire family.  The ending will truly shock.
Miramax 2-disc edition has been handsomely attempted.  Colors are intentionally faded but well balanced.  There is some minor edge enhancement, some scenes that have extremely low contrast and a hint of fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will terribly distract.  Also, there are a few scenes in which the picture appears slightly out of focus.  This is a very dark visual presentation and watching it in a completely darkened room is recommended to get the most out of the experience.  The sound is 5.1 and quite effective.  Dialogue is presented at perhaps a listening level a few notches below what is considered normal so turn up your volume before you start to watch.  Extras on disc 2 include documentaries, featurettes, theatrical trailers, interviews and stills.  Overall a very nice job.",1047254400,,1460,4.866396761133603
1310998,4,B00003CYLJ,"The irony is I was ""more scared"" of viewing this movie than I was while watching it. The previews gave me more chills, but honestly there is nothing really scary in this movie. It just made me feel ""tense."" You wait in anticipation for something absolutely scary to happen and the most scary thing is the curtains being left open.

Reading the reviews here at Amazon makes this movie worth watching. I mean, watching and then reading. GLBT's review had me almost rolling on the floor. It was worth watching the movie to understand why he said what he did. Sweetmolly's review is probably more in line with how I felt about the movie. Lleu Christopher (Author of The Stone of Alexandria) mentioned it reminded him of ""Rebecca"" and I have to agree. Although I found ""Rebecca"" more creepy.

There is this one scene where Nicole gets walloped with a door that is quite hilarious in a slapstick type way. Finally there was some comic relief. Otherwise there is a ""certain tension"" throughout the movie. Nicole is perfect for the role of the obsessive compulsive mother.

You don't understand the implication until the creepy twist at the end. I want to start asking questions about the ""logic of the story,"" however that would completely give away the interesting aspects. You will also feel yourself becoming very skeptical about the characters as the movie progresses.

What you basically have is an obsessive mother living in a mansion in a misty woods where she keeps all the curtains closed. She believes her children to be photosensitive (acutely sensitive to all forms of Ultra Violet light) and keeps the light out of the rooms by locking one door and then opening the next. To get to her children, she has to lock and unlock doors. This adds a bit of fun when she has to get to them when she thinks they are screaming. Except her children are not the ones making the noise. It is a boy named Victor who she can't see, but her children can see.

The entire story occurs at one house with most of the activity occurring inside one room or the other.

They really don't develop the characters. We know they are religious, but we have no ideas what they actually enjoy doing. The children only study, the mother only locks doors and embroiders. There are a few religious discussions. The script writers make a  point of having the children question religion in a way that is beyond their understanding.

Not riveting, but interesting from an artistic perspective. If you are waiting for blood to drip through cracks in an old wood floor, you will be slightly disappointed. What is impressive is a movie with a lack of sex, swearing (can't remember any) and slaughter. It proves a movie can be entertaining without being excessive.

Honestly, this is a nice movie you can watch on a quiet evening and not feel afraid to walk down the hallway to bed. I'm pretty sure that was not the case if you saw it in the theatre.

1311067,4,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman is usually a hit or miss with me, but she did a great job in this tidy little gothic offering.  As an English wife and mother holding down the fort while her husband is away during WWII she is wonderfully neurotic and twitchy making her daily rounds and often wakes up screaming.  Into the fog bound large mansion and adjoining grounds comes a mysterious threesome, ostensibly answering her ad for gardener and housekeeper.  These three are introduced to her children who are suffering from acute sensitivity to light [shades of Roderick Usher in Poe's work?]  Thus the servants are admonished to always close the doors and lock them behind them and to take care that the drapes are always drawn prior to the children's movements, oh, and to keep it quiet so as not to activate Nicole's migraines.  The children start seeing and hearing things, and eventually Nicole must acknowledge that something is amiss in the house and that there are `others' lurking about.  How the three servants and her absent husband factor into the story makes for a nice turning point and twist in the tale as it progresses.  It was a nice diversion on a gray, rainy day here in western Washington.

1311068,3,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a PG-13 Ghost Story set in 1940's England.  Nicole Kidman stars as the a British mother who is raising 2 children who have a strange sensetivity to Sunlight.

Being head strong she at first doesn't believe some of the claims the children make.

However I do have complaints about this.  For one thing it's boring as hell.  Not a whole lot happens until towards the end.  In fact most of it consists of the mother and daughter arguing.  Then when the supernatural stuff does start to happen it's more like an attempt to restart the Poltergeist Franchise.  However I was pleased with the ending for 2 reasons.
A: the Movie was finally over
B: It actually made sense for a movie of this type.
So in my personal opinion this is a renter.  It's not typical horror (in that there is a lot of splatter) or any other GHost story.

1311069,5,B00003CYLJ,"To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns.  Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.
The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isloated mansion following World War II.  Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning.  The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur.  Is the woman going mad?  Are the servants involved?  Have intruders secretly entered the house?  Or could it be--something unearthly?
The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances.  But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character.  In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film.  It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.
The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right.  But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel.  If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.
The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other.  Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk.  The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.
It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance.  But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found ""Grace"" an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.  Torn between giving the film four stars and five, I err on the side of generosity; it is a classic-style ghost story, and I think most viewers will enjoy it.

1311072,5,B00003CYLJ,"What exactly are ""The Others""? That is the question haunting the audience through most of this elegant, sophisticated, and scary gothic thriller. The film, from Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar, takes the ""old dark house"" movie and reinvigorates it through intelligence and imagination. With its star, Nicole Kidman--at her enigmatic, beautiful best--the movie holds you in its clutches from the opening moment, when Kidman's troubled character awakens in bed with a terrifying scream, and doesn't let go until the final twist at the end.
The story takes place in the absolute seclusion of a stately, cavernous mansion on the fog-enshrouded Isle of Jersey, the southernmost of Britain's Channel Islands, in the days following the end of World War II. (the entire film was shot in Spain.) Grace (Kidman) lives here with her two young children. All are sadly aware that her husband and their father is not likely to return from the front. Three servants arrive to replace those who have inexplicably disappeared. Everyone tries to settle into a semblance of normalcy, but something is definitely not right. The children suffer from extreme photosensitivity whereby sunlight might kill them. So Grace darkens every room with heavy curtains, using only candles or fireplaces for light. Then, her daughter claims that she has seen and talked to ""intruders."" A deeply religious woman, Grace refuses to believe her ""ghost"" stories. Yet locked doors are discovered open, and a piano bursts into music without a player in sight. A strong sense of foreboding lodges in every shadow and mysterious noise. What caused the original servants to vanish so abruptly? What happened to Mom when she went ""crazy"" a few months ago? And why do the new servants, who claim to have worked at the house years before, exchange oblique references to impending ""changes?""
Kidman, coifed and groomed so as to remind you somewhat of Grace Kelly, rules this nightmare with a steely determination to ward off any evil that might threaten her children. But her nerves are quietly going to pieces. Equally as formidable is Fionnula Flanagan's nanny, a strong, no-nonsense presence who also wishes to shelter the children from these intruders.
The youngsters are marvelous. Alakina Mann possesses a combination of curiosity and stubborn pride that makes her a constant thorn in her mother's side. James Bentley has large, bewildered eyes that swim in a pasty-white face, a perfect mirror of the audience's increasing anxiety at the super-natural incidents.
Elaine Cassidy's (her perormance being one of the few aspects of FELICIA's JOURNEY I actually enjoyed) mute servant girl and Eric Sykes' stolid gardener give the staff a commonplace touch at odds with their often strange demeanor.
Directing his own meticulously crafted screenplay, Amenabar manages to craft an intelligent and suspenseful psychological thriller, a rarity these days...",1044230400,6,2912,5.305194805194805
1311073,3,B00003CYLJ,"You may figure out the plot twist long before the characters do.  But in a way it isn't the point.  This movie offers glimpses of troubled human souls.  It's almost more Chekhov than Hitchcock.
The suspense and thrills are Hitchcockian, but the desperate attempt by the main character to cling to Catholic catechism and the emphasis the movie places on religion seems something new-- Almedovarian?  Trapped on the foggy isle of Jersey, a mother tries to keep things under control-- which is not easy, since her two children are so allergic to light that any light stronger than a candle causes them to break out, and sunlight would kill them.  Her husband has not returned from the war, though the war's been over for a year and a half.  The servants have disappeared without a word, not even waiting for their wages, and to top it all off, Ann, her daughter, claims to hear noises and see a boy named ""Victor.""
Three new would-be servants arrive and are hired at once.  Lydia never speaks, but nobody is quite sure what happened to traumatize her.
What's of most interest I think in Almedovar's spooky film is the emphasis on religion.  There's a sorrow running throughout that approaches tragedy.  Whoever is haunting the house, nobody is going to Heaven.  The movie raises issues of madness, love, devotion and alternate realities that are broached delicately and with insight.
I found myself more interested in the movie after learning the surprise ending-- it made the characters' behavior early on, and the revelations of what they knew or tried not to know, more human and powerful.

One foggy morning, three new servants turn up and strange things begin to happen. Grace's husband, Charles, suddenly turns up at the door from the front...

1311075,5,B00003CYLJ,"Set in a vast, dark house which is located on the isle of Jersey, in the days just past WWII, THE OTHERS casts a bleak, somber mood the moment it begins. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the lady of the house, a fastidious woman of intense religious faith. Grace suffers from inconsolable grief over her husband's disappearance during the war. Grace welcomes a trio of servants to the house. She mentions that the previous ones just departed without warning one day. Her two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight: to protect them the windows must be covered at all times. Things get spooky when little Anne says she speaks to a boy nobody can see... I thought Kidman's performance was quite excellent: she's learned a thing or two as an actress. The suffocating atmosphere is flawlessly photographed by cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe - definitely a first-rate job. Is the story predictible? Rather. But it's done with great style and taste. Makes you feel like a kid again - when you were psychic all the time: when we grow up most of us lose this gift (I haven't) because its deemed childish or foolish. Okay. I'll admit that I like to get out of the thirties and forties sometimes! I was recommended this film by my Amazon friends, and, because I found it reminiscent of THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS & THE UNINVITED, naturally I ate it up. I find that good ghost stories in the movies are WAY too few and far between: in Scotland, they are practically an everyday reality. Thus my 5 star rating.",1043798400,8,1506,4.686792452830189

I love scary movies but this was to scary for me. I mean, it wasn't grousome you know ? or violent but it had something called morbid and this was sure a morbid movie.

1311185,3,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman's awful performance aside (she's terrible!), ""The Others"" is a decent addition to the growing number of modern horror flicks that eschew special effects for more subtle, psychological thrills and, of course, the ""plot twist."" Seriously, the most visually creepy thing in this movie is the woman with the ""funny eyes"" but how much did that halloween costume cost? For minimalistic chills, ""The Others"" is a decent addition to a growing genre of ""psychological"" thrillers with supernatural elements.
Now call me old fashioned but after ""The Sixth Sense"", the awful ""Stir of Echoes"" and the lacklustre ""Signs"", I'm starting to miss the old blood, puke and guts horror flicks. I miss that old pancake batter on Linda Blair's face in ""The Exorcist"" or the flying murderous appendages in ""The Evil Dead.""
I like the old plot twist as much as anybody but when you base the whole film around that (they're dead but don't know it yet), the film does not hold up to repeated viewings. I mean, once you know they're dead, there goes the neighborhood. While ""The Exorcist"" presents a terrifying subject matter in a spine-chilling way, that movie does hold up to repeated viewings because there's no ""twist"" to speak of. It just scares the ... out of you time and time again.
So my advice to the dozen or so people who haven't seen this one yet, or know about the ""plot twist"", RENT (don't buy) the DVD and watch it with the lights turned down low. Return to video store and forget.",1043539200,,1483,4.751937984496124

Highly recommended",1043107200,,445,5.095890410958904
1311190,4,B00003CYLJ,"The greatest strength in The Others is it's creepy gothic atmosphere which pervades every scene. This is definitely a mood film, all about creating an off-kilter texture of images on screen that feels like they take place in another world. But an all-to-similar ending to another recent ghost blockbuster weakens its overall strength.
The film jumps right into the story as a mother (Nicole Kidman) is showing new caretakers around her large mansion on a small island off England during World War II. Soon we're introduced to her two children, who have a rare skin condition that don't allow them to be in the sunlight, and learn her husband mostly likely died in battle. But things begin to get strange in the already creepy environment when the daughter is convinced there are ""invaders"" in the house, ghostly sounds and visions that soon begin to haunt the family.
Without a doubt, if it wasn't for the deliciously crafted mood created by the set, music, and lighting (expertly realized with candlelight), as well as the superb acting by Kidman and her two young co-stars, this film probably wouldn't be worth your time. The tried and true plot device of a haunted house works, but the ending feels like a let-down when you know you're supposed to be shocked. If The Others had come out prior to ... possible spoiler warning ... The Sixth Sense, its very similar ending would have had a much deeper impact. Yet it's also not as expertly crafted as The Sixth Sense, which never let on to its shocking revelation. Instead, The Others gives enough clues along the way that when the final twist is unraveled, typical reaction is only slight surprise. An additional small annoyance throughout the film is the overstating of particular ideas and observances. Whenever the film would offer enough clues to easily figure something out, the characters always have to state it, just to make sure the audience gets it. As long as you're an attentive audience member, you don't need to be told, and doing so just seems like an insult to your intelligence.
After all that, it may sound like this film isn't all that great, but honestly, as I said before, the ending nor the minor problems leading up to it really don't matter a whole lot when compared to how expertly this film conveys mood and it's unsettling gothic atmosphere. The Others is perfect on a foggy October evening when the moon is full and you just may believe in something supernatural out there.",1043020800,,2452,4.785377358490566

If you enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"" or similar movies then you should thoroughly enjoy this film, it scares even more with no gore, blood and violence.  The cinematography is absolutely brilliant, it keep me wanting to shut my eyes almost the entire movie it was so suspenseful.  In fact, I'll make a confession here, I started to watch this late one night by myself but decided to wait and see it another night when I wouldn't be alone after just a few minutes of viewing.  The director  did a wonderful job of starting with and keeping up the tension the whole film.
The only people I wouldn't recommend this film to are the viewers that want to see some guy in a face mask chop up screaming teenagers.  This is a thinking movie with great acting and lots of surprise and suspense, a strong recommendation.",1042848000,,1048,4.484210526315789

1311281,5,B00003CYLJ,"On the isle of Jersey in 1945, Grace and two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a large darkly-lit estate by themselves, the husband/father having gone out to fight the Germans.  Three servants appear at the door in response to an ad.  They are two elderly people, Ms. Mills and Mr. Tuttle, and a young mute named Lydia.  Grace, grateful for the help, accepts their services.  A severe young lady wearing dark clothes, she is very religious, demanding, and narrow in the view that she is always right.  For example, not only is she a stickler for her two children in learning their religious lessons, but she makes it clear in no uncertain terms that Ms. Mills must close every door that is immediately opened and to leave the curtains closed, as her children are photosensitive.
Of the children, the older Anne has begun to question the religious programming instilled by their mother.  As she points out, wouldn't it have been better for the Christian children in their lesson to deny Jesus before the Romans but still secretly believe in him so they wouldn't be executed?  She is also headstrong, insisting that there was a boy named Victor who was crying, and despite being punished by her mother for lying, refuses to acknowledge she's in the wrong.  She also tells Ms. Mills that when the old servants left, ""Mummy went mad"", something that Nicholas insistently refutes.
The one scene where it's clear something's going on is when Grace attributes a series of noisy thumps to Lydia.  She is annoyed when the chandelier above her rattles and is about to tell her off when she sees to her surprise, through the window, Ms. Mills talking to Lydia in the garden.  It then becomes clear that there are intruders in the house, intruders that cannot be seen, intruders who leave lights on, enter rooms, and even play the piano.  Ghosts?
Alejandro Amenabar, best known for the snuff-film thriller Tesis and the mystery thriller Abre Los Ojos, chalks up another winner his in his U.S. directorial debut, effectively creating an eerie haunted house thriller.  Like his other two movies, the tension grows and tightens bit by bit, to a frantic pace during the movie's last half hour, ratcheted by eyebrow raising scenes and discoveries.  The near-dark setting in the house adds to the gothic aura, as does the music he composed for the movie.
Nicole Kidman (Grace) should've been nominated for a Best Actress award for this movie, not Moulin Rouge.  She does an effective portrayal of a woman whose tried and true beliefs are slowly challenged until they fall crumbling to the ground, driving her sanity to the brink.  Fionnula Flannigan plays Ms. Mills as a kindly grandmother-type, an anchor of dignified strength and pillar of support, someone the children find easy to talk to.  And both children give credible performances, especially Alakina Mann (Anne).
The finale is one of those last-minute twists that will make one think back to certain points in the movie and think, ""OHO, so that's what that was about.""  Definitely one of the best movies of 2001",1042070400,,3056,4.846153846153846

I waited for this one to come out on DVD because I feared a ... pour acting job by Nicole Kidman. But I have come to the conclusion, after much debate, that her performance isn't what ruined this moive. It was probably terrible before the first bits of celluloid were warmed up. There are two general types of mystery plots 1) in which the author carefully constructs a set of clues that when followed lead to a logical conclusion 2)the author provides random clues and a metaphysical (or impossible to construct from the clues) conclusion is invented to make the story appear deep and well constructed. Under the hands of a great artist the second type of mystery can actually be entertaining. But ""The Others"" reminded me more of short story contest winners written by friends when I was in 6th grade. Forced symbolism is envouge and I will tell my friends from back in 6th grade the good news. But it is also painful to watch when there is no acting talent or interesting cinematography to back it up. Not all movies have to be logical to be entertaining. But in this case neither element was provided.",1041984000,,1201,4.564814814814815
1311283,4,B00003CYLJ,"Terrific thriller directed by Alejandro Amenabar and produced by Tom Cruise, who took on the project after he bought the rights to Amenabar's Open Your Eyes and remade it as Vanilla Sky. Nicole Kidman gives a brilliantly mannered performance as a woman waiting for her husband to come home from the Second World War in a large, gloomy manor on the British island of Jersey. Her two children, who are both allergic to natural light to a near-lethal degree, insist they're hearing things go bump in the night during their long hours of playing by candlelight. Nonsense, says their mother, and off you go before you give me another migraine. Soon come three new servants who may have more than their share of answers as to what's really going on in the spooky old house. Audiences will definately compare the ""I See Dead People"" thematics of this film to The Sixth Sense, and there are many similarities to compare, but this film takes more of its inspiration from British gothic horror movies of yesteryear (most notably Jack Clayton's 1961 The Innocents, adapted from Henry James' novel The Turn of The Screw). Fionnula Flanagan matches Kidman's brilliant performance with a real presence as the new housekeeper of the manor, and the two youngsters playing Kidman's children are unbelievably charismatic. Make no mistake, even for those smart enough to guess the outcome before it happens, this is one very scary and marvelously enjoyable movie. Watch it again after you've seen it once, it magically gets scarier with every viewing!",1041984000,3,1532,4.964980544747082

""The Others"" is a creepy, spine tingling film that gave me chills all over.  I watched it at night by myself and I was freaked out.

In an era when suspense/thrills typically involve multiple teens being hacked to pieces in various bizarre ways, ""The Others"" is a throwback to the way movies used to be made--it achieves suspense through music, timing, camera angles, atmosphere, and a wonderful story...and not a single drop of blood is spread throughout.
The ending is a delightful unexpected twist, a fitting explanation for the events preceding.
Suspense...ghostly chills...and no bizarre killers in hockey masks. An intelligent, well-made film that I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.",1041724800,,697,5.5233644859813085
1311286,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is a cinematic rarity these days, a good, old fashioned, ghost story! In fact it's so old fashioned that some of the things you won't find in it are killer cyborgs, acid spewing aliens, or genetically engineered puking dog-thing snot-monsters! But don't worry, because what you will find is a superb story, a clutch of breathtaking performances, and a palpable sense of dread that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat `til the very end.
The story is set during the last years of WWII on an island off the British coast. On this island is a secluded, fog-bound mansion, inhabited by a single mother, who's husband went off to the war, and their two children who suffer from a strange condition, ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum,"" which means they are hyper-sensitive to light. The mansion is permanently shrouded in fog outside, and permanently dark inside, as the heavy drapes in each window are kept permanently shut to protect the children. Any prolonged exposure to full sunlight will result in the children being subjected to blistering, 3rd degree burns, or even death.
The mother, Grace Stewart, a breathtaking performance by Nicole Kidman, is overly protective of the children, to say the very least. She frets and worries incessantly about their condition, and is compulsive in her checking of door-locks, and the security of the drapes over the windows. The children, Anne and Nicholas, luminously portrayed by Alakina Mann and James Bentley, live a stifling twilight existence within the walls of the mansion, dealing as best they can with their medical condition, and the suffocating love of their mother.
As we meet Grace for the first time, screaming herself awake from an unseen nightmare, we can see that she's under incredible pressure, and at the end of her rope. She's barely able to cope with the loss of her husband, the children's condition, and running the mansion single-handedly, the servants having deserted the family a week ago, without even collecting their last weeks pay! But help arrives in the nick-of-time, in the shape of 3 estate workers, a housekeeper, scullery maid, and gardener. Grace is initially suspicious of the 3 as she had yet to post a ""Help Wanted"" ad in the village shop. The housekeeper, Mrs Mills, wonderfully played by Fionnula Flanagan, explains that they used to work at the mansion in years gone by, and called on the off-chance of finding work, in doubtless trying times.
As if the initial set-up isn't bizarre enough, with the arrival of the new staff things start to get really strange; inexplicable noises, talk of ghosts, a photographic ""Book of the Dead,"" musical instruments playing unaccompanied... and Mrs Mills knows far more than she's letting on, as do the scullery maid and the gardener!
I'm not going to say anything else about the film; I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it already, I'll just say that I'm not ashamed to say I did NOT guess the final twist in the tale! In fact, I actually saw the film twice when it was first released, because the cinema was evacuated about half way through when there was a tornado warning in the area; I couldn't wait to go back and see it again the next day!!!
Much has been said about Nicole Kidman's performance, and I have to say she is amazing! Highly-strung, brittle, compulsive, fiercely protective of her children...and her accent is wonderful! She drives the film relentlessly, along with the performances of Fionnula Flanagan, and the children; James Bentley, as Nicholas, in particular, gives an incredible, jaw-dropping performance. But it's the writing and directing of Alejandro Amenabar that is the secret of ""The Others."" The story is wonderful, and the direction exemplary; Amenabar builds the tension and sense of dread relentlessly, `til you don't think you can stand it any longer!
This is a 2-disc set, and the ""extras"" disc contains a couple of interesting items. There's the ubiquitous ""making of"" feature, and a documentary on a family who's children actually suffer from ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum,"" the disease featured in ""The Others."" There's also an SFX feature... like I said, no killer cyborgs, snot monsters etc, what SFX?!?!?! I was certainly surprised by the explanation; this film just goes to show how subtle modern CGI effects can be.",1041552000,8,4305,4.955739972337483

Nicole Kidman gives a performance as Grace, the mother, that will stop people from saying, ""Oh yeah, Tom Cruise's ex wife,"" once and for all. Kidman shows that she's an A-list actress and not just a gorgeous face.
The character, Grace is a complicated woman. It's obvious from the first moment we see her that she's just barely hanging on. Her children have a life threatening condition and can not be exposed to sun light. Her daughter is angry with her. Her estate is lonely and no one ever comes to visit. Her husband is at war. Her nerves are shot and it's just a matter of time before she cracks. And then weird things start happening...Is someone trying to scare Grace or is she imagining all this?
The ending, which I won't give away completely shocked me. It's the last thing you'd expect and explains everything that's gone on in the film perfectly.

Relying on sight, sound and innuendo, the film doesn't need the hi-tech special effects of most films of its kind, and it's Nicole Kidman's understated emotional portrayal that carries ""The Others"" to their climatic detiny. Set in 1945 post-war Britain, Kidman and her two overly-protected children awaken from some unknown nightmare at film's start and inch in increasing fear toward their sacrificial end, that sacrifice being to madness. Kidman is magnificent as the controlling matriarch, and it's a tremendous compliment to her talent that she manages to keep the psychological pressure on through the entire film. Rest assured: there's no predicting the film's end, and its shock will remain. Now this is what a ghost story should be!",1040083200,2,931,5.213333333333333

Her well-performed obssessive complusive character comes face to face with an environment she cannot control. It is this tension that makes the suspense so palpably desperate and thrilling.
Alakina Mann steals the show with her portrayal of Kidman's precocious and strong-willed daughter Anne. She seems to embody the strength of the truth Nicole Kidman's character can't seem to come to terms with, and their adversarial relationship is entertaining and refreshing.

- Alejandro Amenabar's interactions with the actors

1311403,5,B00003CYLJ,"I just loved the ending to this film, I did suspect, but I could never be quite sure, I just have to say that of all the films I have seen, the finale to this one was peachy!  Actually, I am glad I never twigged 100%, I would have missed out on the thrill.
When this film starts off and Nicole Kidman is interviewing people for the servants' jobs, I thought ""what a nutter"", locking all doors, no light in rooms where the children were to be, the kids couldn't run about, not allowed outside etc etc etc, however, this just added to the superb storyline.
This film had never appealed to me, I only watched it because my own daughter had said how good she thought it was - I am glad I heeded her advice because I thoroughly enjoyed it too.  It does not make you jump, but it does keep you interested - creepy scene when her daughter is playing with the string puppet in the attic though.
Great film with a superb ending, I definitely recommend this one.",1039564800,,952,4.225274725274725
1311404,4,B00003CYLJ,"This movie is definitely very creepy.  It is one of few movies made recently that relies almost entirely on suspense to be scary.  That may be a downside to this movie, in that it is almost entirely suspenseful until the very end.  The ending was one of the most intense scenes I can remember in a mainstream Hollywood movie.  The other bad thing about this type of movie is that it is only good to watch twice, since it is fairly slow.  Once to watch it, and then once again to catch the foreshadowing.  After that, there really isn't that much else to watch it again to see.  I recommend this movie as one of the scariest I've seen lately, and well acted, but it is not worth seeing more than twice.  That's why I have to give the DVD four stars...it may not be worth the money to buy.",1039132800,,787,4.2

This movie relies on it's excellent plot and a twist that will give you chills.  This is not a typical horror movie but but appears at first sight as being more of a psychological mystery.  You can tell that there was a lot of thought put into the development of the story, and this is a rarity is movies of the present day.  The only complaint I have is the movie can kind of drag on and for those of us who are impatient or have short attention spans may find it difficult to sit through it.  The most advice I can give is to stick with it even if you feel like it is going nowhere; the twist is just around the corner.",1038787200,2,730,4.006896551724138
1311515,5,B00003CYLJ,"I thought that ""The Others"" was a very good horror movie.  I was kind of expecting one of those stupid special-effects focused horror movies that would be pretty retarded overall, but this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy movie.  There were virtually no amazing visual effects in it, because they weren't neccessary fot the movie.  Based on the old gothic horror story ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, the movie is about a mother of two children who hires some new servants at her mansion, and the children begin to see strange, eerie things that are made creepy not by what you see but by what you simply hear.  The simple sounds of footsteps thumping upstairs and the sillhouettes of small children at night make the film very genuinely freaky, and this movie is built more on psychological horror than anything else.  Overall, this movie is very good (especially if you watch it in the dark, like any horror movie), and I highly recommend it.",1038096000,,960,4.690476190476191

The biggest problem is that the ""shocker"" ending isn't shocking at all. I saw the ""twist"" coming from a mile off.. as would anyone who's seen ""Sixth Sense"" or ever heard a ghost story in their life.
Second problem... it's dull. We've got Nicole Kidman and her two kids in a dark mansion, being haunted. That's it. Oh, and the housekeeper and a mute. So, there's lots of scenes where someone hears screaming... thinks it's one of the kids... goes running to investigate.. the music gets all ""ooooh... spooky!"".. then they enter the room and... and...
It's empty.
And a door that was closed is now open. Or a door that was open is now closed.

1311517,4,B00003CYLJ,"After hearing all the hype surrounding The Others I finally decided to give it a look and found it better than what I had expected.  Nicole Kidman plays a religious mother living in her large home on the island of Jersey in 1945 with her two children, both of which suffer from a disorder where they blister and turn very sick from being exposed to too much sunlight.  When Kidman hires some new servants strange things start going on, and an otherworldly presence is felt.  Kidman is great in her role as an overbearing mother who really does love her children, but takes it to a new level.  Director/writer  Alejandro Amenabar (who wrote and directed Open Your Eyes which would be re-made as Vanilla Sky) effectively uses atmosphere over flashy special effects to achieve a chilling tale of mystery and suspense with a twist ending that seemingly comes from nowhere.  All in all, anyone looking for a good thriller should definitely check out The Others.",1037750400,,956,4.763636363636364

1311523,5,B00003CYLJ,"Having read several reviews of this movie it seems that the major criticism is that it's boring. If you are the kind of person who doesn't like to read, doesn't care for symbolism, and likes constant action you may not like this. However, if you like a great story, which takes time to build both the characters and the plot, you should like it.
At the beginning of the movie we learn that the servants of the house have suddenly and inexplicably left and new servants mysteriously show up. Nicole Kidman's character Grace has two children who will die if they are exposed to any sunlight (I was shocked to find that this is a real and incurable disease). Grace is a resentful woman who has lost her husband and is trapped in a large, dark house because of the children's illness. She is a sternly religious woman who dominates her children. She obviously loves them but shows them almost no affection (until the end of the movie). She has a rocky relationship with her daughter, and obviously doesn't believe the child when she tells her about the apparitions she sees. The movie slowly builds to a climax where we learn both who the servants are and who is actually haunting the house. This movie tells two stories. One is about a dysfunctional family, the other is the ghost story.
As a religious person I found the lack of God and the depiction of the afterlife depressing. The movie presents death as simply an eternal extension of life here. Some conservative religious people might find this offensive.
I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. The more you watch it the more you discover. I love 19th century literature and this is what this movie reminded me of. Again, probably not for people who are into action and adventure films. More for people who like a well-developed, intelligent story.",1035849600,2,1826,4.673913043478261
1311620,4,B00003CYLJ,"A young woman at the end of WW II, whose husband was killed in the war, raises two children in a huge house on a foggy island off of England. The children are photosensitive and cannot be in the prescence of light for long. The young woman, Grace, places an ad for domestic help and a trio of mismatched servants arrive on the scene to aid the woman. Strange happenings occur and Grace begins to lose her grip on reality.

THE OTHERS has a wonderful cast who perform superbly. The sets, scenery, sound, lighting, costumes, and effects all add to the eery mood and tone of the film. The film gives just enough information, while keeping enough information hidden to keep the audience guessing to what is going on.

The movie is in many ways like THE SIXTH SENSE. However, THE OTHERS is different from that movie in one major aspect. THE OTHERS makes a point to question the improbability of the Christian faith. This aspect of the film is overlooked by many, but it is there. The one thing that Grace has to comfort her after her husband and servants leave is her faith. She constantly refers to it throughout the film. The film's ending causes not just Grace, but everyone to question what they believe. There is nothing wrong with the questioning, but THE OTHERS does not present anything else as an alternative to what Grace believes. It leaves the viewer feeling as though there is no answers and that there is no God. It is this stealthy, anti-Christian message that prevented me from giving this film 5 stars. Bash a person's faith all you want, but be willing to present your alternative when you do.",1035676800,,1606,4.572916666666667
1311621,5,B00003CYLJ,"Alejandro Amenabar has done a wonderful job with the direction of The Others.  On top of this is a cast of actors who work seamlessly together.  Nicole Kidman brings to life her role.  What I loved most about The Others was the little use of special effects.  The unknown is much more fearful than a 50 million dollar FX budget.  Place this movie among the classics like Halloween.  This type of film will make you jump and cringe at what might be around the corner without losing your interest in the middle.  I loved The Others and think that any horror movie freak will also have a fond enjoyment of it.
Apart from the film the DVD transfer is excellent.  Most of the movie takes place in a dark house.  Colors are dark and deep.  I recommend to turn out the lights taking away the reflection which might occur.  In Digital 5.1 I heard an array of sounds perfectly placed to enhance the experience.

I went with my family to see it in the theater and I didn't like it a whole lot. It did have a couple of jump scenes and a very unpredictable ending, but the film took too long and I nearly fell asleep watching it. Rent this movie before you consider buying it. Some people liked this movie, others did not. Rent it, and if you like it and wish to buy it, then feel free to do so. As for me, I've seen a lot better than this.

The mother and children, the house, and the servants that arrive at the door unexpectedly all have an eerie edge. Nicole Kidman does a great job as an uptight mother raising her two children in a lonely environment. The children are home schooled, never go outside the house and the shades are always drawn because they are sensitive to light. After the servants arrive, the house is filled with mysterious sounds, voices and strange happenings. This movie is top notch because it is well written and the acting is so good. I was totally unprepared for the ending and thought it was very original.

1311625,4,B00003CYLJ,"The compelling supernatural thriller THE OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman is one of the most effectively-shocking films since THE SIXTH SENSE. The hook of the film is to not so much visual exposition, but cleverly implied with Kidman's brilliant performance and incredible tension-building suspense. Sharp editing a brooding score add to the film's visual panache, and with so much talent behind the project, it certinally delivers. The director, Alejandro Amenabar, assembles the film like a jigsaw puzzle by not giving too much away until the gripping climax, including several moments which made me jump in the cinema! Great stuff.

1311627,4,B00003CYLJ,"Already being an admirer of Alejandro Amenabar, The Others cements him in my mind as one of the classiest directors of today. His previous works, Thesis and Open Your Eyes, demonstrated Amenabar's ability to use images and sounds to unease an audience and keep you hooked until the last frame. Differing in feel and appearance to Thesis and Open Your Eyes, it is again the style of The Others that is the movie's strongest point. It is a return to the classic techniques of Hitchcock and Wise rather than the easy approach taken by today's directors of slasher and gore fests.
The cast is superb, with this being Nicole's finest hour to date. You can feel the tension in her performance and her obsession for her children oozes through every scene. Both Alakina Mann and James Bentley are believeable and convincing as the children with the house and scenery almost characters in their own right.
The DVD (2 discs)comes with some wonderful features including an overview of Amenabar's work today. We can only hope the Spaniard Amenabar stays true to his craft and continues to direct films such as The Others.

1311628,5,B00003CYLJ,"A few weeks ago, while browsing through DVDs, I overheard a store clerk dissuading a customer from purchasing The Others because it was just another Sixth Sense. What a pity!
I found The Others to be much more enjoyable than ""Sense"", much like an old tapestry with so many subtle colors and layers.
The performances are extraordinary, headed by Nicole Kidman as the mother. At first and unsympathetic character due to her stifling austerity and rigid religiousity, she gradually and subtley transforms into a poignant, lonely and vulnerable young mother awaiting her husband's return from the war.
The two children, Nicholas and Anne are wonderful. Alakina Mann as Anne is stubborn and somewhat rebellious, constantly tormenting her younger and terribly insecure little brother played by James Bentley.
The caretakers, especially Ms. Mills, played by  Fionnula Flanagan dispaly such subtelty that the slightest nuance can change seemingly begninity into cold calculaing malice. Only at that end do we learn who they are and what they want.
It IS somewhat of a demanding and somewhat sophistacated movie,
heavily atmospheric and claustrophobic, but a terrific denouement makes it all worth it, and make it more enjoyable over repeated viewings.",1033344000,,1243,5.341836734693878
1311629,1,B00003CYLJ,"How obvious can this twist be?  We had it figured out within the first 45 minutes, and then had endure the seemingly endless histrionics of the crazed Nicole Kidman, as she rushes from room to room to room in the big spooky house with all of the weird noises and voices etc etc etc...
After a point, all of the supposed buildup just gets tiresome.  The acting only serves to exhaust one's patience even further.  Kidman veers between brittleness and hysteria and simply wears the viewer out as a result.  As for the children, I was ready to tie rocks to them and drop down the well.  How irritating can they get?  That little boy has got to be one of the single most irritating actors to afflict the movie screen in decades.
If you want a truly creepy movie, watch ""The Innocents.""  You won't know what the hell is going on, even when you are done, and as many questions remain at the end as at the beginning.

It is not about ghosts waiting behind closed doors ready to terrorize the characters, as well as the audience. Because of the way it was presented in those previews, it is a little disappointing emotionally as well as slow paced. However, its new perspective, which you must wait for until the very end of the film, more than makes up for this. On many subjects we assume so much and know so little. Once in a while, in the written word, or on the screen, we are faced with a new perspective that probes the deepest part of our soul. The Others is such a motion picture, the type that you cannot leave behind in the theater. While the cast's performance is excellent, it is the storyline that carries the movie.

Grace (Kidman) is a mother of two young children living in a huge mansion on a small island village waiting for her husband to come home from the war. Her children are hypersensitive to light, and light could be fatel to them, so she has to make sure that every room they walk into is very dark. Soon, three new servents come to stay with them and help out around the house. That's when the trouble begins. Grace starts hearing strange noises coming from different rooms in the house! At first, she thinks it's her children, but soon she learns what's haunting the house might not be human at all! Now it's up to Grace to save her children from the ""intruders"".
The special effects were stunning. The film was creepy, and it reminds you of ""The Sixth Sense"". All of the performances were excellent. The directing was top-notch, and the music helped to create the chilling atmosphere. The film has a suprise ending that will knock you right out of your seat. The DVD extras are a big plus to the movie, too. There is an interview with a behind-the-scenes look at ""The Others"", there is a behind-the-scenes look at the special effects, there is a short featurette of a real-life family similar to the film's plot, there is a photo gallery, Spanish subtitles, French language track, and comes in a widescreen package.
I highly recommend ""The Others"".

The movie was out for five month's in the movie theatre and the first time I saw the commerical for it I did not want to see the movie untill those five months came and the movie got great reveiws and everybody really liked it. At that minute I knew that I had to see this movie. When I did see the movie a little while back I really enjoyed and did get scared more then one time. The suspense scenes made me feel in wonder and awe and when the film ended with it's twist of an ending I was in shock and with the feeling that I wanted more. For a suspenseful movie The Others is probally one of the best that I have ever seen. The reason the movie only got 4 stars was because of the beginnning of the movie. To me it felt as if it was taking a really long time to get into the plot and into the fun but scary scenes. But even though the beginning might be slow the scenes that are shown for the rest of the movie is worth the wait. The Others has a fun feel to it as you watch each minute waiting for more tense scenes. The Others give's you the feeling that you spent your money for a good reason. But what makes the movie so good?What is the plot to the film?
Nicole Kidman is the star of the movie and she plays Grace who is on an island during the war in which her husband was sent out to fight in. There she lives with her two children,Anne and Nicholas,who have an extremly rare diease where they cannot go into the light or they would gets hives and get very sick. Anne keeps complaining that the shades keep being opened and there is crying all caused by a little boy named Viktor. Grace is sick and tired of all of Anne's lying and always scaring her younger brother so she makes Anne say all of her prayers. But then doors start opening and there is banging coming from the upper floors and what about those three new servants that have just been hired to replace the last ones...who just disappeared!
The Others is basecally wonderful. The DVD has two discs which I think is totally useless. All of the special features that are on the second disc could all fit on the first disc so I think the double disc thing is totally useless.
So go see The Others right away. The two hours that you use in you day are worth it. The movie is fun and very suspenseful to give you the feeling in which that you want more.

I foolishly took a friend's advice and bought this movie thinking I was in for an audio/visual treat but all I came away with was the feeling of emptiness and that I had been cheated.
The Others tries to be a horror/thriller/mystery/suspense but grows boorish by the minute.  I was glad when the movie was finally over as it was as painstaking as watching water boil.  Don't get me wrong, there some parts of the movie which will surprise you but in retrospect they don't seem to really lead anywhere or even flow with a sense of purpose....it's as if they were thrown in randomly so that the movie could be classified as a suspense/thriller.
What is supposed to be a surprise ending leaves you with the feeling of, ""Haven't I seen this somewhere before?""  And yes, we have all seen it in movies such as 'The Sixth Sense'.
I have never really liked Nicole Kidman as an actress (I've tried to like her work and just can't) and this just confirms why I will probably never watch another movie of her's.

Perhaps I thought she was only riding on his coattails, but this movie and Kidman's performance in Moulin Rouge prove that she is a gifted actress in her own right. The Others is a stylish thriller taking place during WWII.  Kidman plays a nervous mother of two young children who have a genetic disorder that makes it impossible for them to be exposed to sunlight.  While Kidman's husband is away fighting in the war, she places an advertisment for a new nanny.  That's all I can say about the plot without giving it away.

The Others is a good film; not brilliant, not original, but good. The film itself is excellent on all levels except one: originality. I've read this same story (I won't ruin it for you!) in the works of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as have seen it on The Twilight Zone and other Twilight Zone-rip off shows. However, the condition the children are afflicted with in the story puts a different twist on the story altogether, and sets up some potentially eerie situations. This condition is actually confronted and explained in a featurette included on the DVD.
The Others isn't a horror film; it's more of a paranormal thriller. The viewer will experience plenty of eerie moments, as well as a few scary ones, but nothing really altogether out of the ordinary haunted house stories of old. There are, however, some twists that make this film engaging and worth watching to the very end (which may surprise), even if the viewer is burnt out on the whole routine haunted house premise.",1032134400,,1128,4.645

Once you finish watching this movie you'll star to notice untied noghts such as why was that father there.  That scene with the father did not add to the plot at all.

She completely deserves all the worldwide critical acclaim she's received for it and deserves her string of awards and nominations. Her performance in ""Moulin Rouge"" does not even come close to her performance in The Others. The film itself is simply a gut-wrenching, breathtaking, intense, psychologically satisfying and flawless piece of work, the kind that hasn't been seen in the cinema for a LONG time.

1311818,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is a brilliant film.  It is almost Hitchcockian in its use of music and light.  Watching it, I've felt the same stomach-clenching suspense and fear that I did the first time I saw ""Psycho.""
The story is brilliant, because by giving the children extreme allergy to light, the author creates an autmosphere of a trap for the family.  Extreme paleness of all the characters makes them feel eerie even before we know why, and the ending is too good to make any comparisons to other films.
However, the best weapon this film has is Nicole Kidman.  Over the years she's been miscast as a pretty thing that's fun to look at.  In this film, her acting talents are so overwhelming, she should have gotten the Oscar for them.  A lot of her acting comes not through the words she speaks (with an impeccable English accent), but through the inflections of her eyes, the intonations on her face, and the movements of her body.  It is one of the fines perforamnces I've ever seen.  This film will yet turn into the kind of classic that ""Psycho"" became.",1030838400,,1051,4.553191489361702

1311908,5,B00003CYLJ,"This film wildly illustrates what an incredible mastery of filmmaking a relatively new director like Alejandro Amenabar brings to bear on each of his productions.  Previously known as the director for the provocative and memorable Spanish precursor to Tom Cruise's recent film ""Vanilla Sky"", here Amenabar seams together a perfectly concocted blend of sight, sound and sensation to delight and chill us in ""The Others"".  He's aided and abetted in this marvelous cinematic effort by the superb acting of Nicole Kidmann in a no-holds-barred performance, as well as by a terrific supporting cast of relative unknowns. In addition, everything from the cinematography (that is, the way the director chooses to use the camera to further the mood and affect of the story) and the soundtrack music are all contributing elements in a  tour-de-force effort that drags us along breathlessly as the awe-striking plot winds toward its date with destiny.
The outlines of the basic story is seemingly simple and straight-forward, but in matter of fact is full of subtle aspects that subsequently serve to powerfully affect the direction and spin of the events that suddenly and mysteriously begin to malevolently transpire. All of it is believable, due in large part to the work of Kidmann as well as the way in which the director uses every aspect of his craft to set the dark, somber and threatening mood piece we need to work the story toward its conclusion.  His use of music to add to the suspense is unusually adroit, and when we realize he has also composed the score being used, we begin to understand the degree to which his range of talents extends.
This is a wonderful movie, one that employs all of the basics of terrific film making extremely well, and one which takes an ostensibly simple idea and then plays with it artfully to stretch our minds and the range of possibilities out before us in a tantalizing and yet horrifying way. It is a movie that is neither predictable nor conventional, yet it movies well within the boundaries of established traditions in such a smart and economical way that it continues to surprise and delight one long after the initial viewing. This one get two thumbs WAY UP! Enjoy!",1030492800,11,2210,4.901069518716578

Her acting as well as every member of the cast was exceptional (the kids and Fionnula Flannagan).  What a wonderful old-fashioned ghost story with a totally surprise ending only outdone by ""The Sixth Sense"" which preceeded it. The slow pace builds and builds brilliantly until the heart-stopping ending.  Clues are interspersed cleverly and you will find yourself looking back at key scenes just the way you did with ""Sixth Sense.""  I watched it one night and then had two friends over the next.  We had a great time.  A classic, cerebral ghost story that takes advantage of its sensational sound effects and well-developed atmosphere to project real goosebumps.

1311910,3,B00003CYLJ,"This movie was very well shot and very well acted.  The story is interesting enough, and the ending, at first, seems quite interesting; but once you think about it and deconstruct it a bit, it took too long to build up to it, is a bit predictable, and somehow just lacks some oomph to push it over the top.
Kidman and her children play out the scenario of their willing seclusion quite well; especially the children who are particularly eerie, only beaten on that front by the house's increasingly omniscient helpers.
Call it a setting piece, for the main character in the movie is not Nicole Kidman, but the architecture and the fog outside.  The mood is more important than the story.  This works for some movies certainly, but here, I feel it to be an overall failure.  Still, better than the majority of today's Hollywood films, but even so, see the 6th sense instead if you're looking for a good modern ghost story.",1030406400,,920,4.591463414634147

 I was also very pleased with Nicole Kidman. I had never seen her in this kind of role, and I had my doubts, but I was so wrong, she was GREAT! Kidman's character is very disturbing, she is seeing things in her house, that her very strict religious beliefs say cannot be! You will be wondering if they are real or all in her head. Her kids don't help her either, they are seeing things as well, but they are sure thier mother is having serious mental problems.

Once I saw this film, complete with the impressive scenes they showed on TV to hook potential watchers, that's when I discovered it to be ""typical"".
While Nicole Kidman and the two young children played their roles well, Bertha Mills made me suspicious. By WWII, they weren't even wearing the late 19th Century servant's clothing. Bertha refused to post Grace's letter, helped the gardener cover the ground with leaves, and encouraged Anne to talk about her suspicions. The mute woman was the only one that looked right in what she wore.
While Grace tried to fool her daughter into believing that all bad children spend eternity in limbo, Anne got wise to this, read the Bible, and found out differently. If Anne weren't baptised, how could she go to her first communion in the Catholic church? Better yet, how could her mother finish the last part of her head dress in good conciousness?
Anne kept telling her mother that there were ghosts in the house, but her mother and her brother refused to believe her but the thought still scared them both. Bertha didn't seem to discourage such talk, except in the presence of Grace, her employer.
It wasn't until the psychic lady found the children hiding in the wardrobe that things started to unravel. That was the only scene that made me jump. But the mystery disappeared when Grace found a few choice items in an unused portion of the house.
I don't mean to discourage others from renting this movie, but if you are expecting a lot, you will be disappointed.  I encorage you to rent this movie before buying it.",1030233600,,1698,4.736486486486487

You have to listen to every single word in order to grasp the concept [of what's going on].

1311916,5,B00003CYLJ,"It's her eyes.  It's rare for an actress to make such expressive and impressive use of their eyes.  Nicole Kidman does this in ""The Others.""  It reminded me of the underrated Lara Parker (Angelique on the old ""Dark Shadows"" soap).  Ms. Parker also was able to say a million words with those eyes.  Just as Nicole does in this eerily effective thriller.  Alejandro Amenabar's direction is right on target, with the slow, yet tense, pacing; the impeccable cinametography; the great score which Amenabar also wrote; and of course, casting Nicole Kidman in the title role.  We meet Grace as she is awakening from some kind of nightmare, screaming.  The house she lives in is spookier than one would imagine for a ""modern day"" movie.  However, being set in the 1940's, it becomes as integral character as the humans.  Along with Ms. Kidman, Fionnaula Flannagan is superb as the mysterious housekeeper Mrs. Mills.  Also effective is Alikena Mann in the role of Ann, the precocious daughter.  James Bentley as Nicholas is also perfect.  Amenabar manages to meld old-time spook scares with a religiously influenced plot.  Although the ending is telegraphed early on, it's resolution is quite a turn of events.
Kidman certainly has proven she can emerge from the shadow of ex-hubby Cruise, and stand on her own as a versatile and talented actress.  She will win an Oscar someday; particularly if she handles roles as magnificently as Grace.

1311917,5,B00003CYLJ,"Unlike many other ""cheap-thrills"" modern horror movies; this masterpiece of a film bases itself more on atmosphere than on fake scares and mindless gore. It's a story taking place around World War 2; about a secluded family living in a large mansion that think their house is inhabited by ghosts.
 Nicole Kidman does an excellent job in potraying the worrying, over-protective mother of two children infected with a rather rare disease. Kidman is undoubtedly one of the most talented actresses present in Hollywood today; and this movie is yet another proof of her remarkable talent. If she wasn't nominated for an academy award in ""Moulin Rouge""; I'm sure she would have been nominated for this movie instead.
Some would complain that this movie is too slow-paced for their taste; but that's just the beauty of this picture. The dark atmosphere present in the movie and the great performance of Kidman will somehow keep your interest till the end; even if the lead characters seem to spend nearly half the movie wandering about in the mansion and opening and closing doors. And for all those who taught the ending wasn't surprising at all; and that they figured everything out halfway through; blame the critics. It was them who felt the need to reveal to the readers that the ending was very much similar to ""The Sixth Sense"".

Grace's children, Anne and Nicholas, are deathly allergic to sunlight and as a result Grace rarely leaves her large, Victorian house and begins to feel confined if not trapped.
The creepiness begins when all the servants mysteriously disappear and Grace hires new ones, an older man and woman and a teenage girl who doesn't speak. Than, as in any horror movie, things start to happen. Voices belonging to unknown and unseen people are heard resounding through the big, dark rooms, doors which were closed and locked are found open, the beautiful piano in the living room plays in the middle of the night, Grace's children, particularly Anne, claim to have seen a family of four in the house claiming that it's theirs.
And of course there are secrets. Lydia, the teenage servant girl, has not always been mute but Mrs. Mills won't reveal what prompted her to stop talking. Anne and Nicholas speak of ""it"" an event that happened involving their mother loosing their mind.
The ending is breathtaking and unbelievable, leaving viewers saying: ""Oh my God..."" It's a wonderfully done, delightfully terrifying look inside a family, which has been struck by tragedy and a poignant observation of the frailty of the human condition.

1312022,5,B00003CYLJ,"Okay, someone PLEASE explain to me HOW Nicole Kidman did not win an Oscar for her superb performance in this film, ...
But The Others...now this is a good film.  It's one of those European horror films, which already makes it better than most American films (forget the production values or Tom Cruise as the producer, this is NOT a typical Hollywood film).  It probably helps that the director, most of the cast, and most of the production team are European.  Plus, filming was done in Europe.  The result is one of the best haunted house films in a long time.  In a nutshell, the plot is about a family (Kidman and her, uh, 2 kids; the husband is off at war) near the end of WWII who begin to believe their home (one of those great crumbly mansions with long halls and dark chambers) is haunted.  But is it truly haunted or is Kidman slowly going mad? ....  These are but a few possibilities in this genuinely spooky film.
What's more, the suspense is achieved almost entirely by direction, set design, sound, and acting.  The 2 kids are simply amazing.  The girl in particular is easily the equal of ""Sixth Sense"" Haley Joel Osment.  Kidman is a revelation, her controlled and mannered performance probably the best I've seen her do.  Special effects play almost no role in this film (to be honest, there are special effects but they are so well-disguised that you would never have known it unless the 2nd disc of this 2-DVD set revealed them.).  It is a bit like the film Castaway, which had a lot of special effects that were darn invisible.  I much prefer this sort of filming, where the special effects augment the storyline, rather than calling attention to themselves.  The strength of this film is that...even without any special effects at all, it would still be a powerful film.  Now that's good filmmaking!

The Others, unlike The Sixth Sense, always lets the audience know that there is something awry.
In spite of its dealings with the supernatural, The Sixth Sense sells to the audience that they are watching the narrative of a boy figuring out how to cope with his gift/curse, until the twist at the very end. With The Others, there is no such attempt. Something is amiss, but we just aren't sure what it is. Is it the servants? Is it the husband? Is it the house itself? I found myself trying to decipher the many clues it left, whereas in The Sixth Sense, I wasn't led to look for clues, and that is the fundamental difference in the way the ending is revealed.
It works well for the director, who seems to enjoy the fact that he knows something that the audience doesn't, and sort of toys with them by dropping little clues here and there.

1312109,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is a very well done supernatural thriller that gets your attention and keeps it for the entire film.  The setting for the story is a huge old manor house that's located on an island off the coast of England. The inhabitants are a young mother (Nicole Kidman) and her daughter and son. The house is already sinister enough, but the curtains are closed all day because both of the children have a condition that makes them sensitive to light. The time is the year 1945 and the father has gone to fight in the war and not returned. The film begins with Grace, the mother hiring three new servants because the old ones have disappeared. After a period of time strange things begin to happen, and the terror begins.
I watched this film with seven others.  One kept her eyes shut and jumped at every sound. We all thought that Nicole Kidman did a great job, and all of us thoroughly enjoyed this REALLY good scary story.llent movie. Scary? At parts, more thrilling, and intense, because of the way things creep along. The viewer might think they drag, but understand, it is intricately detailed and everything will be explained to the patiend viewer.
It was a rewarding experience in an otherwise dull cliched summer, and Nichole Kidman's performance was OUTSTANDING. I was  surprised about lack of commercials for the film, then I saw that Tom Cruise was the producer for the film, and I suspect the divorce meant he was not as interested in the financial outcome of the film, or helping his ex-wife's career (something to think about).",1027987200,3,1536,4.681481481481481

I agree with another reviewer, as I've always thought so myself-anyone who loved Sixth Sense would probably like this movie too...the ending is pretty similar, unbelievable and shocking. The movie is about two children who are allergic to light; they die if they are exposed for more than a minute or so. Their mother (Nicole Kidman) hires a small family to move in and help care for the children, but there is something so strange about them. Also, one of the children is convinced there are ""intruders"" in the house. At the end of the film, you learn why the children are harmed by light, why the servants seem so strange, and who the intruders are...it all links together.

It was well done, well written, and moved swiftly through the plot. The arrival of a certain relative in the middle of the film threw me off just slightly, but I understood well after the twist at the end, which, while not as impressive of a surprise as the Sixth Sense, was quite good.
Great Film!",1027641600,,450,4.433734939759036
1312209,5,B00003CYLJ,"This was a good performance from Nicole Kidman and the actors who played her children. The truth of the situation faced by them with regards to the ""others"" does become patently obvious and the storyline is relatively predictable. Nevertheless I recommend this movie and would rate it above average compared to a lot of others out there.
If you are into period pieces this is also a good one for you. The story transpires in 1945 as I recall shortly after the end of WWII from which Nicole's husband never returned. Her and the two children live in a spiffy English mansion on an isle in the British Channel that the Germans had occupied during the war. Nicole excellently depicts the haughty and aristocratic lady of the house who knows her social station and is accustomed to directing servants.
The tone of the movie is further set to the spooky end by the medical condition of her children being sensitive to light requiring that the house be kept dark. Since there is no electricity it's all candles and gas lamps and well you get the picture. There is also a fair amount of spooky English fog too...
What you won't see here is a lot of big splashy special effects the film relies on more traditional techniques.
These details give you a sense of the atmosphere but not the real storyline for that you have to watch the movie. I thought it an excellent performance and actually watched it twice (once with my mom too she like it as well).",1027555200,4,1443,4.553846153846154
1312210,5,B00003CYLJ,"Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with ""Abre Los Ojos"", a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as ""Vanilla Sky"", starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.
This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.
Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.
The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the sance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with ""Sixth Sense"" because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.
As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house.  Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.
This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future.  While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.  Don't miss it.",1027555200,4,2656,4.995454545454545
1312211,5,B00003CYLJ,"Speaking as someone who absolutely HATES horror films, I thought ""The Others"" is excellent.

 The movie is set in post-WWII England, in a dreary old house set in an equally dreary swamp/forest (it was never quite made clear). The film begins with three servants arriving at Grace's house, in response to her letter for help. We quickly learn that the previous servants (The ""others"") had disappeared mysteriously, leaving Grace and her two photosensitive children (whose father was apparently killed in the war) all alone in their huge (and perpetually dark) Victorian mansion. To make the setting even eerier, Grace explains that no door must be opened without the previous on being shut and locked. When strange things begin happening right after the servants arrive (whisperings, doors slamming, curtains opening, poundings, mysterious crying sounds), the story turns into sort of a supernatural whodunnit. Is it the malicious new servants, Grace's spiteful little girl, or a force beyond their reckoning? The story also provides psychological terror as Grace begins to reevaluate her devout Catholic beliefs.

 The movie is notably accentuated by a very excellent and bone chilling score, and one heck of a surprise ending (but mystery buffs might see it coming.) My advise is to not try to figure it out, but to sit back and enjoy the movie!!
 Kidman does an excellent job of portraying Grace and all her terrors, and the young actors who played the children also, in my opinion, did an excellent job of adding to the film's bone chilling effect. I highly reccomend seeing this movie!!",1027468800,3,1590,5.1
1312212,2,B00003CYLJ,"When ""The Others"" was playing in theaters, I never got to go see it, but all my friends were telling me how great it was and how I had to go see it. When it came out on DVD, I picked it up knowing I'd like it because I love a smart thriller. Sure thing, I loved the movie. Kidman's performance is as everyone states... amazing and beyond words. The reason my score is only 2 stars is not because the movie was bad... oh, no. The film is great! The DVD however, is not great at all. Dimension has never been able to make a DVD with presentable picture quality and ""The Others"" is no exeption. I was hopeing that with all the critical accliam that this film got that Dimension would pull out all the stops and make the movie on this disk look as good as the recent picture quality that Dreamworks DVD and Columbia/Tristar DVD have been producing for thier recent releases. Yet, the picute quality is still very poor and cheap. My second problem with this DVD is that it is two DVD's when all this material could have easily fit on one disc. There's not more than 1 hour of bonus material on the second disc and all of it is less than interesting. Even if, after viewing the show, I wanted to look at some of the supplemental material, I'd have to go put the second disk in the player. It's just an extra hassle that wouldn't be if all the material was on one disk. These are two really big problems that do not manage to distract from a really great movie. If you're a fan of this movie, you shouls still buy it just to have the amazing film to watch whenever you want. If you haven't seen ""The Others"" yet, then you might want to rent it first to see how put-off you are by the discs flaws. There are a lot of high-quality DVD's out there for some other really exceptional movies that you might want to spend your money on rather than this bottom-shelf, poor-quality DVD from Dimension DVD.",1027382400,6,1889,4.2354570637119116
1312213,4,B00003CYLJ,"Yes, I know it's the movies, and yes, it's only acting, and yes, I like her as an actress tremendously.  Yet after seeing movie after movie with Nicole Kidman playing a cold as ice man manipulator, my movie psyche needs some payback.  I got it with this movie.
So even though she introduces what may be her bitchiest character yet, it was nice to see she doesn't have nearly the power over people she would like you to think.  She plays a mother of two children, probably a widow, in post-war England.  She lives in a huge mansion, and has children who cannot be exposed to sunlight.  It is this condition that forces her to be tough and disciplined, especially to the new trio of servants she has just hired.
But it is not only toughness out of necessity.  If you see how she OVER-punishes her children, and assumes it is the servants who left some doors open (it couldn't be HER!) that she also has some inner meanness to her.  If you've seen her other movies, you KNOW it, but if this is your first Nicole Kidman movie, you have to watch to see the true nature of the character come out.
So when her fragile world starts crumbling around her, I for one was glad to see her unwind by finding that maybe she doesn't have all the power over her house she thinks she has.  We see all the beginning classic symptoms of the haunted house, with unexplained noises and physical things being mysteriously altered.  Of course, all around her deny everything, and after several instances of this, she has to make a decision to accept this, become stronger, or breakdown.
I will reveal to you that all three things happen, but not necessarily in that order.  She does valiantly make a stand to hold her title of Ice Queen. But eventually the supernatural gauntlet she is dragged through causes her to eventually break down.  This was a big moment of the movie for me.
However, I wouldn't be giving the movie four stars if it didn't have other things going for it.  There is a big secret plot twist that I imangine people will say was taken from another recent movie, but I will say it did get me hook, line, and sinker.  And just like that other movie, it honestly gives all the clues necessary to reach this conclusion upon a second viewing.
Which is another reason why I like this.  I did not like ""Vanilla Sky"" (by the way, not the movie this one ""borrows"" from), and even upon a second viewing of ""Sky"", when I knew the secret, I still though the movie did not play fair with the audience.  ""The Others"" does play fair, and was enjoyable upon the second viewing, where it becomes interesting all over again once you know the secret.",1027296000,,2627,4.4324324324324325

1312215,5,B00003CYLJ,"Those Sixth sense fans have waited about 2 years for a similar movie and they've got their wish. One of my favourite movies of 2001, the Others is very interesting. It's a must-see. You won't be yawning as you watch it. This is definitely Nicole Kidman's best work yet. I didn't know she could act like this. It's a tense and a surprising story. It's not a complete copy of the sixth sense. It gives you a lot of detail and it has a fascinating plot. It's not a movie where you can easily guess what's happening. It's a great mystery that almost everyone would love. The chills and thrills it gives you makes it more suspenseful. It's some of 2001's best directed movies. It's a complete story (no major mistakes).

  It revolves around Kidman whose husband is off at war and she has to live with her two kids who're allergic to sunlight. Three workers than come into the story as Kidman's daughter reveals that she's been talking to a somebody who's very different from them. Is that somebody alive or dead? As these thoughts are being concentrated around kidman's head she begins to explore the house to find things she never knew were in the house.

  It's a great story. It has something for all those Sixth sense-The haunting lovers. I highly recommend it. It's a creative piece of work that pulls you towards the edge of your seat!",1027123200,5,1337,4.526970954356846

1312315,4,B00003CYLJ,"When I am in a bragging mood, I like to mention that I usually get the plots of ghost stories and mysteries right away.  This story, a classically sketched not-too-obvious ghost story, is worth every minute you spend trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
Kidman plays the main character in a creepy, pale, pretty-sure-she's about to crack manner which shows she's a lot more than a pretty face.  Her kids are both scary and sad, and the three servants who come to work, and eventually prove the key to solving the whole mystery, (not really a spoiler) are funny at times and disturbing at others.
This is one of the best Victorian-style stories, read-around-the campfire movies I've seen in years.  It doesn't go in for the usual ""gore factor"" that a lot of movies dealing with the supernatural seem to think we all need.  It's suspenseful enough that when a friend of mine jumped at a scene, I too shared that moment of spine-tingle and goosebumps on the base of my skull.  And in the end, I did not feel cheated by the story.",1026691200,,1037,4.49468085106383
1312316,2,B00003CYLJ,"I agree with the other reviews concerning Ms. Kidman's performance. I really do love to watch her in action. I just didn't see much action. This movie was well done, however, I felt like I was being tortured very slowly over a luke warm fire.
I just knew that the story would drop the other shoe at any moment, but it never seemed to deliver. Performances were all very well done by the entire cast. The mansion was spooky, but horribly empty. No woman would live there with her two children, so immediately you are set up knowing the woman was not quite right. Plus, why in the heck would she lock every single door she went through since the kids never seemed to be overly active.
I kept trying to figure why she would need to hire servants when it looked like she needed the money to earn money herself, just to buy furniture. That stays in your mind for the first quarter of the movie. I kept waiting (and hoping) for a crazy cousin to be found in the atic.
Don't get me wrong, I love horror and/or suspense movies, but this one made me feel like the energy vampire had bit me for the third time.",1026432000,4,1100,4.267942583732057
1312317,4,B00003CYLJ,"I'm not talking about waiting for the DVD..but rather the ending!  Can't say much about it, but just know- I had goosebumps for hours after leaving the theater.  Kidman is a one-man show. She can pull of a rather long movie, with subtle dialog and it never seems to be annoying( for the most part). Yes, the movie slacked slightly in places that the editing scissors could have helped, but I put her on a pedestal with Tom Hanks.  Like him, in ""Cast Away"", Kidman has very long scenes and moments of awkward silence that most actors couldn't pull through. She does. It's her chemistry with her character Grace.  Her hair, her costumes, her accent. It's perfect and  very reminiscent of Hitchcock.  I rarely found myself noticing anything around me while watching this film. I think this movie will keep the beautiful redhead from being typecast throughout her career.
Just a tad about the plot. (You really don't want to know much at all)
As the audience we are fascinated by Grace, her huge, very sparse home, her children who have an allergy to light, and the claustraphobia from the curtains always being closed. Her children, she explains, must never see the light, or they will die. This aspect alone makes you cringe with fright because, well, everything goes bump in the night...or perhaps in the constant dark.
Grace hires some house/lawn keepers that appear on her doorstep looking for work..and so the plot begins to develop and unfold.
So is it scary? YUP!
Does it help to turn the volume down? NOPE!
I personally recommend a fabulous pillow to sink your face into while enjoying ""the Others""
My only reason for giving the movie four stars is because like the movie ""Memento""(a GREAT movie), I can not deny there are some scenes that seem to drag a bit to long . But, like, ""Memento"" even those annoying moments are all worthwhile. Figuring out the meaning of the title, ""The Others"" is much  like the deeper multi-conscious meaning of the name ""Memento"" The title is a prize at the end of the film.
On a footnote: this DVD has some of the best documentary footage I have ever enjoyed watching.  The cast/crew/director all let us spy behind the makings of ""the Others"" on a very personal level.  It was definitely worth watching.

I have seen this movie three times. It has replay value. I never seem to get enough of the story and secret plot twists. So, as a reviewer, I must say it's one to keep.  Besides, with all the heart-stomping moments, it's a good aerobic workout",1026259200,2,2485,4.6506849315068495

There's suspense, but you don't leave terrified because there's not frightening images or scenes to stick out in your mind.  Even the overly advertised ""I am your daughter"" scene isn't really that frightening.  It's just that the girl looks old and is blind w/ milky eyes.  Nothing else.  Still, it's interesting and the end will throw you for a loop.  Also, Nicole Kidman has a 5 star performance.  She is such a great actress in this movie.  She's totally believable that you forget it's just a movie.  The kids are cute, too, but aren't very convincing.  The servants are okay, but don't have the quality of performance that Kidman does.

True, it was predictable, & even if you haven't seen the 6th Sense, you would still have guessed what was really happening halfway of the film.

The Others is an absolute masterpiece in the horror/suspense genre.  Rather than relying on special effects to jolt the audience into the next adrenaline rush, this film dares to leave the acting to the actors and the directing to the director and the set design to ....well, you get the idea.  The overall effect to create a true Gothic ghost story, one that leaves the audience not quite sure of the ending until it happens.
Let's face it, if you are reading this review any time in the early part of the 00 decade, you saw The Sixth Sense and will probably have an early suspicion of at least three possible endings of The Others.  Thankfully, the film is so rich that it allows you to enjoy the story and the incredible (for once) work of Nicole Kidman and the ensemble cast for art's sake even after you may have tumbled to the storyline.  To the last three minutes, even if you suspect the ending, you cannot be sure.  And THAT is the mark of an excellent ghost story.  An even greater testament is the fact that I watched it a second time and enjoyed it even more.
This film is highly recommended.  Easily the best of its genre this century to date, and one of my top ten films in the last ten years.",1026000000,3,1212,4.336283185840708

Nicole Kidman delivers what I think is her best performance ever as a mother seeking to protect her children.  Apparently, they are extremely sensitive to light.  (The curtains must be drawn at all times.)  It is 1945 on a British isle, the husband is off to war, and Kidman is trying to hire three new housekeepers.  Three arrive, with an apparent knowledge of the house's past.  Then strange things begin to happen...
'The Others' is one of the best-looking films I have seen in a long time.  A lot of painstaking detail was put into the house itself.  It looks and feels authentic and creepy.  The acting is very, very good.  (The children are surprisingly good.)  The scares and chills of the film are not the same scares and chills you would experience from your average horror film.  This film is way above that.  With so many things going for it, though, you wonder why the ending is so weak.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that if you watch (and not even very carefully), you won't be surprised, but you WILL be disappointed.  The first 90 minutes sets up a wonderful promise, but the last 15 minutes refuses to deliver on that promise.  Why four stars if I didn't like the ending?  Because the first 90 minutes are so beautifully done, you can ALMOST forgive the ending.

1312404,4,B00003CYLJ,"With references to Hammer horror films and The Innocents (one of the best suspense thrillers of its type and a great ghost story as well based on Henry James' Turn of the Screw), The Others is the type of film America has forgotten how to make. It's intelligent, well acted with interesting twists and turns in its plot. I suspose The Others has as much to do with gothic thrillers as it does with more horror films.
Anyone expecting a jump out of your seat, blunt witless horror film should look elsewhere. Yes, the director does linger a bit too long on his mystery and it does take a bit too long to reach its climax but, on the whole, the film is a rewarding bit of entertainment. The performances are top notch and, again, the acting references the melodramatic style of Peter Cushing or  period dramas from the 40's and 50's. Kidman in fact is a perfect female counterpart to Cushing. Cushing's edgy, almost over the top performances were a highlight of even the weakest Hammer film. Here Kidman's acting choices seem inspired by both Cushing and the stable of Hammer actors from the 50's (including the underrated Michael Gough and Christopher Lee).
It's not The Matrix nor does it pretend to be. This fine film is a throw back to an older film tradition where a director actually expected intelligence from his audience. Approach The Others with an open mind. It's rather ironic, because I read a review posted at amazon that claimed Alien was a lame horror film. Remember, that horror is showing the audience but suspense is withholding until the very last minute. The later takes more skill. Hitchcock was a master of suspense (much like Ridley Scott is at his best). It's always scarrier not knowing what you're up against than having it all laid out for you.",1025740800,,1770,4.654952076677317
1312405,4,B00003CYLJ,"When I saw this movie, what struck me the most was that this was a good scary movie that didn't need gore or a demonic lunatic that can't die.  It wasn't a teenager slasher flick rather it was a dark, well-developed horror/suspense that raised the hair on my neck without grossing me out.",1025654400,,288,4.433962264150943
1312406,4,B00003CYLJ,"SPOILER ALERT: don't read this review unless you have seen the film.  As one earlier reviewer has observed, you can figure out one major plot twist about halfway through, but I think you're supposed to.  When the missing and presumed dead husband turns up walking and acting like a zombie, and says he's come to say goodbye, it becomes obvious when Kidman throws her arms around him that either he's still alive (unlikely) or that neither of them are.  But the question still remains to be resolved, who are these frightening ""others"" in the house that no one except the little girl can see, and what are they doing there?  The final twist was very effective, IMHO, and surprised me even though I had seen The Sixth Sense.  What really makes this movie work, however, isn't just the story, which would have fallen apart in lesser hands, but the excellent direction and performances by the entire cast, with special kudos to Kidman, who creates a wonderfully ambiguous character, and a couple of excellent child actors.  Like The Sixth Sense, this movie uses its slow pacing to build up a relentless mood of suspense, and the typical reaction at the end is ""Wow!""",1025654400,2,1162,4.727722772277228
1312407,2,B00003CYLJ,"Oh...I really wanted to like this movie! It's been drizzling & dreary all day, I made a huge pot of soup, and figured, rather than watch ""Rebecca"" for the 90th time, I'll give a new one a chance, as I'd heard this one in particular was ""It!"", ""The One"". ""An Instant Classic!"", ad infinitum... They fooled me again. I liken this movie to the making of a cake. You take the best ingredients, the freshest eggs, the purest flour, sugar, lovely vanilla, etc...then, when it comes time to slowly bake it in the oven, and anticipate the heavenly smells that will soon be filling your house, you decide to take a short cut, and MICROWAVE it! Nicole Kidman is milk maid pretty in her English wool, there's a wonderful English country manor viewed by moonlight , framed by gnarley, leafless trees. The furnishings are authentically period antique, suggesting just the right formal coldness. There's the obligatory spooky servants, fog, skeleton keys, slamming doors, headstones, EVERYTHING for what you think would make a great Gothic type horror/thriller. Well, this cake fell flat. (Okay, enough with the cake analogy). I don't know if it was the script, or lack of one, but this movie never caught fire for me. I guess the acting was adequate, especially the pasty little children, and everyone has lovely English accents. But I found what story there was boring and predictable, the progressive so-called spookiness of the servants laughable, and when they try to wrap everything up at the end with sweeping music and wistful last looks, I didn't care anymore. Definatley made for t.v. material. While I didn't figure out every detail of the ending, I was really close to it by the first half hour of viewing. If you saw the previews for this film in the theater, you've pretty much seen the film, or, at least the best of it. It tries hard to be ""the Sixth Sense"", or ""The Innocents"", but, in no way does it reach those levels of quality.  I don't mean to trash it, but it seems it's just another example of most of todays movie making, where it's about the Star, the publicity, everything but the movie itself. And I guess I'm just disappointed. Judging from most of the reviews, I'm definatley in the minority in my opinion of this film. Okay, maybe it's ME! ...",1025481600,5,2260,4.692695214105793
1312408,3,B00003CYLJ,"Its impossible to review this without blowing the end, so if you have not seen it, and do not want a major spoiler then it would be best to pass up this review.
I was on a group date when I went to see this movie, and was relatively excited for the film because it had looked quite good, and an acquaintance of mine had recommended it. Sadly, this plot was entirely predictable, and the movie in and of itself came off as being somewhat unlikable. Nicole Kidman and her child costars seemed quite whinny to me, and I didn't particularly care for them. I liked the servants though. There was quite a bit of cleaver cinematography, but those of us who learned the artistic clues from the Sixth Sense were able to pick up on what was going on very early into the movie. Some one was a ghost... and it wasn't the ""others"" living in the house. At first I knew that the servants were ghosts. That much was obvious, then, halfway into the film I figured out that Nicole Kidman's character and her kids were also dead. In a very Sixth Sense manner this twist ending that I predicted halfway into the movie came about. It is the sort of ending that only works on seasoned horror fans once. I would have liked the movie better had the ""others"" been the ghosts, and this had been a more traditional ghost film. The problem with twist endings is keeping them fresh and unique. An ending can make or break a film, and in this case its ""I want to be the sixth sense"" ""I saw that one coming"" ending ruined it for me. But I am pretty hard to please when it comes to horror films.
To its credits it did have a couple of good scares, but this was not enough to save it from its over all mediocre ""me too"" plot. The Others is a cheap attempt to mimic the dark magic and genius of M. Night Shayman's masterpiece ""the Sixth Sense."" Nothing more. What is really sad is that this movie could have been a brilliant spook show if it had lead you to believe that the mother and kids were dead, only to reveal that they were indeed alive and slipping into the precious of madness, like in Eternal darkness. Since no one in Hollywood has thought of it, and I just did, I hereby copyright that idea. Perhaps I can make a better movie with a few tin cans and a roll of toilet paper.",1025481600,3,2252,4.215277777777778
1312409,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is one of those one of those movies that I've had in my hand at the rental shop several times and inevitably put back in favor of renting something different. I never knew quite what to expect from this film. I can't believe it took me this long to see something so enjoyable and intelligent. I wish my friends had made me see this sooner.
The production of the movie is deceptively simple, and therefore both elegant and provocative. You never know exactly what the camera is going to find lurking in the shadows, around a corner, or behind a door. From the beginning, there is an air of the supernatural. A persistent fog cloaks a mansion on the Channel Island of Jersey, three people show up unsummoned to work as housekeeping staff after the previous staff has inexplicably abandoned the family living there, two young children that must live in darkness, a controlling mother, and a missing father - a great place to begin a Gothic yarn, isn't it?.
The escalating tension of this film is not reliant on special effects wizardy but good old-fashioned character interaction, brilliant acting (by all parties), outstanding cinematography, and a sparse musical score. If this attention to detail is indicative of what we'll see from Amenabar, then I'm going to be making a point of seeing all of his future films.
As a DVD package, this is a good one that offers a second disc of behind the scene featurettes. ""The Others"" is definitely a film I'll be looking to add to my burgeoning collection.",1025395200,5,1501,4.7110266159695815

The movie is true to the form of  of the haunted house tradition, and the atmosphere is dark, the focus foggy. Women may like this movie better than men, as it is talky and not an action movie, but the suspense slowly builds and the climax is truly surprising.  There are strong performances by the supporting cast of lesser known actors, and the children are portrayed skillfully and authenthically. Highly recommended!",1025308800,,577,4.927835051546392

1312562,5,B00003CYLJ,"This eerie, candlelit film mostly taking place in a large but claustrophobic manor house exerts a static pressure that is relentless.  So many doors and all must be locked, unlocked, and relocked.  Curtains must be closed at all times, then drawn tighter lest a ray of lights gets through.  The two children of the house have a rare genetic allergy to light (Polymorphic Light Reaction Syndrome) and can suffer blisters, boils, even 3rd degree burns if exposed to sunlight.  The time is 1945, the mother and children are alone in the house, the husband/father is missing in action, presumed dead
While the credits roll, the mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is reading to the children by candlelight.  All are seated around a table presenting a homey, if somewhat shadowy, scene.  The movie formally begins with a petrifying scream by Grace jolted awake from a nightmare in her pleasant sun-filled bedroom.  She quickly dresses and rushes to answer the doorbell.  Nicole Kidman convinces in a glance that her character is strung out taut as a bowstring, but striving to contain her many fears and anxieties.  She dresses in a dowdy manner---skirt a bit long, dowdy shoes, and sensible tweeds.  She has a remarkable resemblance to the late Grace Kelly in this film, which I think shows Kidman's forensic abilities.  Kidman is naturally graceful, which Kelly was not.  The mother's edgy movements and slight awkwardness heighten her fragility and rigid inflexibility.
A strange trio greets her at the door who inform her they have come in response to her need for servants.  (Grace has not yet advertised).  They are housekeeper Mrs. Mills (the marvelous Fionnula Flanagan, who is presently appearing in the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood in a completely different type of role), a Gardner, and a mute girl-of-all-work.  Grace, though flustered, immediately shows them around and explains their complicated duties.  They meet the two children who are quickly drawn to the kindly Ms. Mills.  The little girl Anne (Alakina Mann) is especially commendable for her perfect balance of sweetness, suspicions, and stubbornness that always seem just right for a very bright little girl.
Particularly grating on the mother is the ghostly goings on in the old house.  Music plays, doors open and shut, footsteps are heard, and the children refer to a boy named Victor who visits them.  These occurrences are almost too much for the mother who has an unbending, fundamental, religious outlook.  The servants obviously know a lot more than they are saying about what is going on in the house.
This somber, almost stately film has a jolting crash of a conclusion.  So startling was this finale, the moviegoer does not even have time to grasp the consequences---and it is over.  An excellent film.  Kudos to the director and his star!",1025308800,14,2829,5.036559139784946
1312563,2,B00003CYLJ,"The look, acting and directing was great! Some genuine scares.
NOW THE BAD NEWS, from the first 5 minutes you know how it's going to end up. (that's assuming you see the first five minutes and you have a filmatic viewing education past age 9). With all honesty, there were a few twists and turns, but overall, it's pretty bloody obvious.
Conclusion, director Amenabaris not a brilliant scriptwriter. He got away with the original ""Open Your Eyes"" and certainly made better choices than in Crowe's remake, but in this film, the whole use of the ""Skin disease"" throughout made it so blatantly obvious that there was something wrong with the children. Number one, the disease he chose is so rare (only 120 in the US) that one automatically assumes the mother is hiding something, that the children are perhaps ghosts or vampires who don't enjoy sunlight, plus the locking doors behind them adds to the suspicion that the mother actually knows something is up (Which we as the audience are NOT supposed to believe). This ruined the whole film for me due to these meaningless plot points which eventually had nothing to do with it's resolve.
Again, ""Sixth Sense"" formula makes it's appearance as the ""New American Horror Film"". If you really want to see a scary ghost story, try to find ""THE INNOCENTS"" made in 1961, so much better and scarier than any of Hollywood's feeble PG-13 formula films.",1025222400,3,1390,4.795833333333333
1312564,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" have chilled me to the very bone - I can still remember that. This movie is something that we don't usually see anymore. The world has become obsessed with bloddy violence, gory horror movies and unrealistic sex scenes and nudity. ""The Others"" has none of these, yet it is scarier than some of the typical horror movies - much scarier. It leaves us with a feeling of suspense.
The story is one of the most original ones I have seen. Neurotic mother of two (Nicole Kidman) is overly protected of her two beloved children who have a deadly allergy to light. They live in a musty dark mansion with doors and windows tightly shut. Their servants disappear and new servants come in their place and that's when the trouble really starts.
I can remember how I felt about this film - no disappointment or boredom. No, the only things I felt was sense of suspense and especially awe, as this is really one of those unique thrillers that don't come out today.",1025049600,,962,4.5344827586206895

It simply boggles my mind that so many reviewers gave it more than one star.

1312566,4,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman stars in a classic horror noir type film set in 1945, Post-World War Two England. Kidman's character, a devout Christian and housewife, has lost her husband to the war, and now raises her children alone in a massive house on the coast of England. Her children suffer from a rare ""light-disorder"" which seems to make them brake out into strange boils if exposed to the sunlight. The unexpected arrival of the house's previous servants set in motion an odd sequence of events that unfold to reveal an even more terrifying truth at the film's conclusion. This is a great classic retelling of the haunted house horror genre, unfortunatly one cannot help feeling that this film treads on too familiar ground. Despite that, it still manages to retain some of its originality through an atmosphere that it manages to achieve at its conclusion. A feeling of hope is left in the viewer, an emotion that is almost completly foreign to most horror films. A good film, somewhat predictable in the sense that one can pick out certain events, but no one can predict (Even if they get close) the amazing conclusion.",1024963200,,1114,4.807291666666667

I'm so glad to see that from all the slasher so called ""horror"" movies that are being made now, that this one had the courage to be different. All movies are now are special effects, which is good in movies but not in horror! This movie contains no blood and would be suitable for a child...but I'm not saying a child should see this. The acting is superb and the set makes you feel like you're really isolated. Somebody mentioned that it's ""low budget"" but they just don't get that the feeling of isolation here is critical.
Turning doorknobs, cold spots, footsteps upstairs where no one is. Nicole Kidman delivers beautifully in what may be her best performance yet! Also, the soundtrack adds a lot to the creepy dark feel of the film.
Someone also commented on how little actors there are. I think the biggest mistake in horror movies nowadays is that there are too many characters that you get to know very well. This film has only a few charcters, but there's always some suspicion about each of them. Yes, the movie's pace is quite slow, but it adds to the eeriness of everything.

So, being the naive film viewer that I am, I found this to be a spectacular movie that suprised me with it's ending. After the movie, you find yourself continually remembering moments in the film that now fit together. Just like The Sixth Sense, the movie's plot was seamless enough that you don't catch the plot twist-that is, it works and fits together without it. But when you know that small but vital piece of information, it is not just seamless-it's close to perfect. The Others uses virtually no detectable special effects, the way every other ghost story has. There are no moving walls, no monster makeup, no indications at all. The only thing that is more than just psychologically abnormal is the extreme presence of a fog, which can be created by a simple fog machine or graphic effect. That's another great thing about this movie. All the tricks and twists that we see, such as curtains being opened, doors being left ajar, and doors being unlocked when they were obviously shut before, are things that a normal person does. The psychological thrill is really how it all fits together to create a ghastly, macabre picture that leaves you amazed. I must add that there are three groups of people in the story-the family, the servants, and the others. This movie will keep bouncing you back and forth between which group is the ""bad guy"" in the film. Enjoy...",1024876800,,1585,4.664285714285715
1312748,4,B00003CYLJ,"2001 was a breakthrough year for Nicole Kidman.  Not only did she get many cover page stories about her heartbreaking divorce, but she finally proved that she was more than Tom Cruise's wife, and that she was a serious dramatic actress. First came the huge success of Moulin Rouge, which established Nicole as a tender beauty, a talented singer, and a symbol of glamour. Then came her finest dramatic role to date, in The Others. This film is not a horror film. It is a melodrama with supernatural overtones. It is about life after death, but it goes much deeper than that.  There is a central message to the story.. At the end, when Nicole says she loves her children, even though we have learned the shocking and gruesome truth about her, we feel sympathy for her.  This is Nicole Kidman's art, and her art alone, making us feel sympathy for her. she is a tremendous actress, and deserves even greater roles. She deserves to follow in the footsteps of the greats...Crawford, Garbo, Dietrich.. And I believe she will. She has the talent, beauty, and class to become a genuine superstar. The Others proves what we suspected all along.
  There are two scenes in The Others that stand out in my memory. One is when Kidman is lost in the fog and finds her long lost husband. The expression on her face is moving and defiantly sentimental..in a world of actresses that would rather not show such vivid and beautiful emotion. The very best scene, to me, is when Kidman is standing at the gate, after her husband has left her, looking very wistful and sad. It is masterful.
  The Others is the showcase that Kidman has deserved for a long time. With her performance in this film and Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman has covered all the dramatic bases. She is on her way now.",1024790400,2,1763,4.5777777777777775
1312749,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.

On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is  occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.

One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.

Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.

The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.

Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.

It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.

This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.",1024790400,4,3587,4.859247135842881

1312752,5,B00003CYLJ,"I think that there's been so much hype over the Kidman-Cruise love-hate relationship over the years, that I haven't really been willing to give the actress her due professionally.  I bought The Others because I enjoy a good ghost story, and this one sounded pretty good from the descriptions I'd read of it.  Surprisingly I not only got the great ghost story I wanted, I got a new definition for Ms Kidman:  superb performer.  Her portrayal of a slightly unbalanced woman with an obsessive concern over the health and well being of her children was a jewel.  The diligent closing of curtains, the compulsive locking of doors behind her created a natural tension that built gradually as an apparently normal mother grew more and more dysfunctional before the viewer's eyes.  The slightly suspect servants who appear at her door in search of employment, after the woman's previous domestics had left without notice, heightens the sense of ""something's not quite right"" which builds to the denouement.
Although not totally unpredictable, the movie is still a masterpiece of craftsmanship.  While The Sixth Sense, another film I liked, relied more substantially on CGI for its effect upon the viewer, The Others relies completely upon it's set, the progression of events, and the talent of its actors to create that sense of otherworldliness that makes a good story.
Since the action occurs almost totally in the various rooms of an old house and to some extent on it's immediate grounds, the movie might make a good stage play, if it isn't one already.  As such it would certainly give ample opportunity for the set designer and the lighting and sound managers to give vent to their creativity.  I'd certainly look forward to such a production.

1312755,5,B00003CYLJ,"oh yeah!
this was a tight flick yall... ""the sixth sense"" was predictable to me and i had pretty much figured that out from the beginning... but this movie!?!?! the others!?!?!? man...normally you sit back and try to super-sleuth durin the lulls in the movie, but they don't really offer you many opportunities to do that with in this one...
very suspenseful...BR>well acted...
and actually pretty scary!!! my 13 year old spent the night in her mama's bed after seein this one...(and she had jus seen '13 ghosts' two weeks ago and was braggin bout how good that movie was...but she loves this one even more! FROM A 13 YEAR OLD YALL!!!)
the ending was a complete surprise to me and had me completely perplexed up until the final few frames... this is a great date movie, but i gotta get this one for my collection as soon as possible...",1024272000,,835,4.573333333333333
1312756,4,B00003CYLJ,"Had ""The Others"" been released about ten years ago, it would have been hailed as a classic. However, because the movie has virtually exactly the same plot twist as another film of recent years, it instead comes off as a bit of a copy. (If I mention the film it draws parallels to, it will guarantee to spoil it for you, but you'll probably figure it out. The director even maintains the same limiting conventions.)
Nonetheless, this is a very good film. Nicole Kidman and Fionulla Flanagan both hit exactly the right timbre for their roles and the children artlessly combine a sense of dread, resignation, obedience and stubbornness.
Remarkably, there is not a single cuss word, nor to my memory, as much as a drop of blood shown. This screenplay could have been written 50 years ago and still have passed the censors. But that in no way makes it a Disneyesque family film. There are several definite heart-stoppers, and it is infinitely scarier than anything in the Friday the 13th/Jason line. My wife is no big fan of the horror genre, so I let her know that this was a gore-free, psychological horror film.
""Yeah"", she replied, ""those are the worst kind.""

I had no expectations going in (to The Others) and even watched it a second time to see if maybe I'd missed something good, and still nothing.  Kidman was wooden, the plot rambling and unbelievable.  I was hoping for some suspense -- there was none.  Hitchcock would roll over in his grave.  This film is pure drivel.  Kidman should be embarrassed -- she has the ability (see Dead Calm). I expected nothing and GOT nothing.",1024185600,7,549,4.608247422680412
1312875,5,B00003CYLJ,"Before this it had been quite a while since I had last seen a horror movie, but I have seen plenty in my time. The Others, although it stands terribly as a horror movie, makes an excellent movie on its own and within its own territory.
Firstly, there is little action throughout the beginning and middle of the story, just glimpses of the latter part of the film. A few basic horrific elements (children chanting prayers, a bad daughter-mother relationship, a big creaky old house) keep you on your toes as you wonder which road the story will go, and which horrific elements it will end up keeping. Clever use of techniques prey on the viewer's emotions and interest and keep him or her glued to the film until the end.
This is a great addition to any DVD collection, as long as you're not expecting a wet-your-pants experience. I'd normally give it four stars (for lack of a meaningful central theme and the use instead of a common surface one) but the fun goodies on the bonus disc are worth an extra star.",1024185600,,1009,4.489130434782608

1312877,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is an absolutely incredible movie.  Only too rarely does a movie come along that can absolutely stun you all at once with its implications.  The ending of this movie absolutely caught me unawares, and in one single instant, before the movie even told me what was happening, a blow of shocking revelation hit me right in the stomach.  Few movies deliver a personal epiphany to the viewer, but The Others does just that.  I cannot point to any part of the film that was not perfectly done.  Nicole Kidman gives her best performance ever, carrying the audience along with her character's pain and confusion.  The children plays their roles remarkably well, with all the subtlety and believability required to make this movie succeed as a psychological masterpiece.  The three servants were magnificent, although I did not appreciate the true greatness of their performance until the end.  The house itself is very much a character in the movie, and the darkness, gloominess, and vulnerability it projects into every scene is palpable.  There are surely great challenges to directing a movie with such an atmosphere and darkness and isolation, but not only did a twenty-eight year old Alejandro Amenabar direct a masterpiece, he also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score.  The music, without a doubt, greatly magnifies the effects of the increasingly tense, otherworldly atmosphere.
This movie was quite different from what I expected from the trailers I had seen.  It definitely has the power to frighten and unnerve its audience, but this is so much more than just some kind of psychological horror.  Anyone passing the movie by as just another haunted house story is robbing  himself/herself of a great experience.  The DVD package contains a number of extra features on a second disc, and the supporting material does add depth and meaning to the movie's themes.  Along with a look at the making of the movie, there is a feature on the rare disease the children in the film suffer from, an affliction so rare that there is very little awareness of it among the public.  The only thing missing is an audio commentary of the movie by the director and/or actors.
This is really one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen and truly deserving of the critical acclaim it has garnered.  The ending really hits you like a ton of bricks.  Calling The Others a movie is doing it a disservice; it is a profound, unparalleled  motion picture experience that you should not allow yourself to be deprived of.",1024099200,4,2526,4.873536299765808

When three strangers appear at Grace's door to respond to an AD she hasn't even posted up yet, strange ""things"" have started happening around the house, and a macabre secret is revealed.
Nicole Kidman gives a powerhouse performance (Heck, she was nominated for a ""Golden Globe for this performance!). The story line is very creative: it's always on track. Though this movie's a slow developer, it always leaves you with the ""chills"" and ""thrills."" The ending is so surprising... it's so cool! The actors' performances were also very good but it's Nicole Kidman that steals the show along with this movie's artistic and one of a kind storyline and awesome suspense and thrills.

1312880,4,B00003CYLJ,"Fine, atmospheric ghost story, almost on par with the 1963 version of The Haunting or the equally famous The Innocents, the latter of which it has a great deal in common with.
Religious neurotic control freak Nicole Kidman maintains an isolated house in the English countryside in perpetual darkness, to keep her severely light-sensitive young son and daughter protected.  Her husband is missing in action in WWII, and antisocial Kidman keeps herself and her children walled-off from the world at large.  The new housekeeper tries to liven things up a bit, but is stymied.
Into this environment come...Others.  Unseen parties opening the always-drawn curtains, moving the furniture, opening and closing doors, and whispering to the children at night.  Kidman and the children have occasional nightmarish visions.  Try though she does to deny the reality, Kidman is forced to acknowledge that these other unwelcome occupants are in her house, and she puts up a valiant struggle against their influence.
Contemporary audiences and jaded ghost story addicts will be a step ahead of this movie, but that is of little matter.  It's still a great film.  It's slow, stylish, and old-fashioned, employing suggestion and atmosphere to communicate its chills as opposed to more overt horror tactics.  The entire cast is terrific, especially Kidman and the two kids, who are adorable.  The cinematography is top-notch, the direction steady and sure.  It's thematically rich, the title having more than one application  -  which the viewer will appreciate, after having seen this magnificent film.",1023926400,2,1585,5.321285140562249

This is not merely meant to frighten in the ""Hellraiser"" or ""Evil Dead"" fashion. It is an old-fashioned, make you nervous and bite your fingernails type film. I for one was held in suspense. I really just enjoyed the whole darn thing. I don't think comparisons with other films are fair. It is much more atmospheric. And I did feel for the character, maybe I felt some kinship with her because I am a woman, I don't know. But you could tell she was trying so hard to be strong and she did a good job, but she just couldn't do it anymore after a while. I worried about her and her children and while I knew something was amiss, I couldn't quite put my finger on it.
I love movies like that. Plus, I am a sucker for English movies and misty isles. Hey, what can I say. Beautiful film, Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and yet you still feel empathy for her. I thought the children were excellent. You wanted to hug them, comfort them. The actors who played the servants' roles were excellent as well. I can't say anything bad about this movie. I wish I could find books and other movies that made me think like this one did.

I'm not one to be really scared by a movie and this one didn't terrify me,but it was spooky and I got the chills a couple of times. The film is moody and atmospheric with some beautiful cinematic shots. Writer/director/composer Alejandro Amenabar proves that you don't need a large all-star cast and a lot of expensive special effects to make a good movie.
I haven't seen a lot of Nicole Kidman's movies but I was very impressed by her performance as the protective and high-strung mother,Grace. Alakina Mann was also very good as her daughter and Christopher Eccleston gives a brief but noteworthy performance as Grace's long-lost husband.

Nicole Kidman is superb and completely oscar worthy,Halle Berry might have gotten lucky for whatever PC reasons,but Nicole Kidman truly deserved the oscar. Her acting was flawless,as that of a supporting cast,especially Fionulla Flanagan.

The bumps and the slamming doors, the constant lack of light, the perpetually heavy fog, and the spooky understatement of the servants, (yes, Fionnula Flannagan can be scary, remarkably) were far worse than a bunch of digital ghosts could have been.  And Nicole Kidman was great, wonderfully intense and completely loopy, and tottering around the house all day.  The children's photosensitivity was an inspired touch, since keeping everything in the dark only increased the claustrophobia of the creaky old mansion.

1312971,5,B00003CYLJ,"...I must say, I did not watch this movie when first possible. The previews for THE OTHERS made the movie seem like the scariest thing ever created, which is not uncommon these days with trailers. (The trailers ended up spoiling the real hair-raising scenes, such as when the little girl becomes possessed by the house's spirits...) Also, a friend of mine told me the ending of this movie. Nevertheless, I still watched it. And you know what? I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.
Nicole Kidman gives one of her best, if not her best, performances ever. I still am in shock that the Academy overlooked her role in this movie and the movie itself. (Fortunetly though, they were able to see her outstaning feats in MOULIN ROUGE!)
For those who don't know the storyline, the film is about a mother and her two photo-sensitive (A.K.A. The light is fatal for them) children who live in a secluded mansion on an island in England. The man of the family is off fighting in the war. Becuase of the light's danger's, no two doors are to be open at the same time. Meaning--if you open a door, you must close the one behind you. These little ""rules"" of the character's lives are what make this movie one of the most stylish examples of horror out there. Anyway, back to the plot: At the beginning of the film, three people come to help the mother take care of the house, the grounds and the children. (The mother had placed an ad.) But soon, creepy goings-on begin, and the mother's tightly bound world starts to become loose.
No special effects in this movie, which I think is a modern achievement considering what out culture calls ""horror"" and ""thrillers"". (Watch for the lovely twist of an ending too!) All in all, it's a great movie to sit down on a Saturday night to watch, and it's destined to become a masterpiece.",1023580800,6,1801,4.52760736196319

In other words, The Others has nothing to say, so you have to watch a group of fine actors go through their perfunctory duties in order that the plot, in all of its self-congratulatory cleverness, is fulfilled. But what a long wait for the movie viewer, who must languish through all the cliches and bathos and paper-thin characters! And for what? There's no thematic pay-off here, no real idea.

The pace is slow, but gripping, and when all is said and done, everything in the film comes together in a fantastic conclusion which gives a revoltuionary perspective to the paranormal world.
Set in 1945 at the end of the war, a women awaits the arrival of her husband while looking after her two children who are photosensetive to light.  After three strange servants arrive to tend to the house, some strange things start happening.  Although it would spoil the whole movie if I were to tell you what they are, what I can tell you is that you will encounter the suspense in this movie through the movement of lights and shadows and fog and the acting of Nicole Kidman's supportng cast.  And although you will never be confused by what is taking place, you will never be sure of what to expect to come next. This is a different kind of suspense thriller with its own thrills.  This movie definately demonstrates how naieve and oblivious people are and the pain of the truth.

Glad I saw this film on DVD: in a theater they would have had to keep the volume turned all the way up for you to hear important things whispered or said in a nearby room, thereby blasting your ears and body when something really really loud occurred.
The story line is intriguing and suspenseful. It nice to see a film that doesn't depend on gore to create a sense of horror; I thought the motion picture industry had almost completely forgotten that was possible. The actors did a wonderful job. Settings--indoor and out--added meaningfully to the storyline. The ending is kept well-hidden throughout most of the film. But is anybody employing soundmen anymore? There was a time when whispers were made audible but still were clearly whispers. There was a time when loud sounds seemed loud but didn't try to destroy your hearing.
I had to keep using my remote to turn the sound up and down, often rewinding to pick up something I couldn't hear because the sound was too soft, then finding myself blasted at times by sounds that were much too loud because I'd set my TV temporarily to a normal volume. That fact made it hard to enjoy the film.
The film would have earned a 4+ of a 5 if it hadn't been for the soundtrack. As it is, the 3 that I gave it is actually a 3-.",1023408000,,1272,4.3940677966101696

The movie starts off kind of slow, which got me thinking at first that this was going to be real sleeper. But being the patient person that I am and having an attention span longer than that of a fruit fly I kept watching.  I guess what perked my interest to continue watching was when Grace tells her three new servants that every door must be locked first before another is opened. My eyebrow went up that point. I mean how strange! It seemed like a superstitious thing at first, but then Grace explains that her children are photosensitive (thus, making it so that no light must be able to enter any part of the house). I have to say when Grace went inside the room to retrieve her sleeping children I expected her to bring back two little gremlins or something. They way she acted and talked to the servants about the house ( ""You will find there are many things about this house that are unusual"" or something to that effect) kind of helps to set the tone for the movie's creepy aire. That in addition to its dark cinematology and lighting.
The movie defintely gave me chills and caused me to pull up the covers of my blanket a couple of times. Nicole Kidman gave a pretty good performance as she slowly began to doubt her sanity -after a few strange happenings of slamming doors and stomping  of footsteps up above - mainly due to her rigid, stern personality. This keeps her from being able consider other possibilities and look for the answers that are right before her eyes. After seeing the ending I don't want to say to much about the movie, because it will only dull any of you newbies to the suspense. The ending's unveiling of the movie's mystique to all the strange supernatural occurances immediately made me think of a certain Bruce Willis movie. Oh, god i think i said to much.

1312977,4,B00003CYLJ,"I was deeply disappointed with this movie. I had read so much on how well Kidman did in this movie, and I agree she showed acting abilities that I had not often seen from her before. But the whole movie seemed way too familiar...like not only had I seen it before, but I also had read it before. Several family members sat together and watched this movie, and we were expecting a lot. But all of us knew what the ending was going to be before we got to it (and none of us had seen or read anything about the ending). So it was a bit of a disappointment. It was a more stylized version of the Sixth Sense, without the 'fear factor' involved.
Though Kidman and the other adults were well acted, the children left a bit to be desired. Whether this was the kids' fault or the fault of the directors, I have no idea. So many people came out and said that this movie was going to become a classic...is that just because the abilities of our directors/producers are not as good as in the past (with Hitchcock and others) that movies without obvious violence, gore, etc. cannot reach the previous level that those directors met in the past...that we are settling for 'classics' which are not as good?
If this movie had come out prior to The Sixth Sense, I think I would have liked it more...but it didn't...and I don't!

""The Others"" is a wonderfully old fashioned movie, literally the sort of movie they don't make any more. While it is indeed a chilling, even scary, movie, there's nothing in the film that would keep it from being shown on network television. No nudity, no violence, just atmosphere and suspense.
Nicole Kidman plays a mother on an island off the coast of England in 1945. She lives alone in an old house with her two children, both of whom have a severe allergy to light, while they wait for the man of the house to return from the war. The household staff vanishes into thin air one night, and the mother has to put up an ad for new servants for this eternally dark and secluded home. When some arrive, all sorts of strangeness begins ...
It's a remarkable movie that, in 2002, is still frightening when devoid of all the splashy (and easy) special effects-reliant ways horror films have come to rely on. Compare this to ""The Haunting,"" which was long on special effects, but mostly devoid of any chills. Instead, ""The Others"" has a chilling sequence with doors being open in a locked piano room, another with a voice in a child's bedroom and the sound of footsteps in an empty upstairs room.
Wonderfully acted, brilliantly directed, ""The Others"" is a must for fans of true horror films and those fans of modern gore-fests who, to paraphrase Dan Akyroyd in ""The Twilight Zone,"" want to see something REALLY scary.

If you plan on seeing it, PLEASE do not let someone ruin the ending for you, it is THE greatest twist ever in film.  Nicole Kidman was stunning in her portrayal of Grace, a mother dealing with two ill children, a husband gone to war, Nazi occupation, missing servants, and a ""strange, high house in the mist"" to borrow a quote from Lovecraft.  Through all of this she bravely soldiers on in the old way, a way that you'll not see again.  If you have a grandmother who lived through the war, and still shows a strength of character, love and resolve, you will see traces of her in Grace.  Her performance was moving even to me, a fellow that likes ""guy"" movies normally.  I was not a Nicole Kidman fan before seeing this, but her performance made me one.  Seroiusly folks, if I (again just a regular guy that normally likes action/ sci-fi films) could be moved by this film, it must be good.  It is scary, but not bloody.  The whole atmosphere of the film is one of suspense and waiting for the other shoe to drop.  If you don't like to ""get into"" the characters and really analyze them, you will enjoy this movie as a haunted house tale.  If you like to analyze and get into the characters and their motivation, you will enjoy it even more.  It really demonstrates the fact that bad things often happen to good people.

To sum up my rambling, great haunted house film with a ""who-done-it"" element thrown in.  The Others also has the best, most thought out and fully-fleshed characters in film.  Get this movie or I will haunt you!",1023321600,5,1685,4.422077922077922

...when you are unbiased and expecting of everything--and essentially nothing at all--you are nominally satisfied with whatever you get...
...Well that is what many of the reviewers of this movie have fell victim to. They expected something like they've never seen before, and were let down. Although this movie does appear to lack a plot, the plot becomes finding the plot...that is where the ""Suspense"" genre comes from. Finding out what exactly is going on. The better suspense dramas are done without providing confusion.
 Confusion usually comes by way of boredom and consequently, you are waiting for the end credits hoping that between then and now, the movie will have a meaning--much like what happened to me when I watched ""Monsters Bash"" (probably Halle's worst and best--for obvious reasons)
 But getting back, this is a well done movie. The movie is about ONE thing. The point of the movie is to find that out. I don't really want to ruin it for anybody--because I hate when people ruin movies for me--but it really messed up my realities of the movie. It instantly screwed them up...and that's what's provided by any good mystery/suspense drama...

1313077,4,B00003CYLJ,"I love suspense but most of the time I just don't get scared.  This is the first movie in a long time that has made me jump.  I think the only one that has made me jump more is the 1940's flick The Uninvited.
Overall The Others is well acted, although the characters can seem a bit flat at times.  The story has some lovely nuances that reminded me of classic black and white movies such as The Uninvited and Rebecca.  However, in my mind the best thing about this movie is that it avoids blood and gore and relies on leaving certain details to linger in your imagination before they are fully woven into the film.
Perhaps the best thing about this movie...it kept me guessing.
I highly reccomend The Others especially to classic film buffs.",1023148800,,741,4.386861313868613

The surprise ending left you feeling slightly uneasy and thinking about how life can be.  A very good movie.",1023148800,,593,4.462962962962963
1313080,4,B00003CYLJ,"If you're a fan of the old-time ghost story, where the suspense builds throughout the entire movie, then you'll really enjoy The Others.  It's very much like The Sixth Sense, with a very stunning ending, although the buildup isn't quite as dramatic and the ending isn't quite as stunning.
Nicole Kidman plays the lead, Grace, perfectly.  She starts out normal and very protective of her children.  Her children are allergic to light, so the house is normally completely dark.  As the movie progresses, Kidman begins to lose her grip on her sanity.  She plays it perfectly, slowly losing it.  It's an outstanding performance on her part.
The story starts out very slow, with three new servants arriving and basically having things explained to them.  It does take a while for things to get going, around a half an hour.  Up until then, be ready to sit through some rather tedious dialogue and exposition.
However, once things pick up, they really pick up.  The suspense builds through several riveting scenes.  Unfortunately, you probably know some of them from the previews, which gave away a couple cool scenes.  But there are some unexpected twists, right up until the last twenty minutes, when there are two huge shocks.
The lighting is very well done, keeping the mood perfectly dark.  There really is no humor in this movie, so be ready for a somber, if not downright depressing movie.  For you special effects junkies out there, this isn't the movie for you.  The only real special effects are some fades and some bad green screen work, which looks extremely fake.  But, despite the fact that there's a feature on the effects, there's really no need for them.
Overall, this was a very good film.  The beginning was slow, but if you can stand the wait, the rest of the movie more than makes up for things.",1023062400,,1810,4.753205128205129
1313081,5,B00003CYLJ,"Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being scary, as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  The Others, written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you cant swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, youll know youve arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go.  By the end of the film, its clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.
The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her childrens nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.
Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Graces immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, theres more:  Anne insists that she has seen others in the house, including a young boy she calls Victor.  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne.  And its about to take Grace to the very edge of whats left of her sanity.  If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.
More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of its sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with its own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with its perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandoras Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere hes so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds.
Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in Moulin Rouge this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.
Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one in service, and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  Its a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film.
The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, The Others is an inspired film that offers one of, if not the most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  Hes made the Super in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  Its an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and its the magic of the movies.",1023062400,3,5796,4.778557114228457

1313185,2,B00003CYLJ,"I wanted to like this horror flick. It started out well enough: a subtle, slow-burn build-up of the tension, low-key camera work, no intrusion of loud and melodramatic music. Nicole Kidman (looking remarkably like Grace Kelly) plays a very uptight, bible-obsessed mom of two kids who, vampire-like, can't be exposed to sunlight - hence the shadowy setting for the movie. The enigmatic servants arrive at her isolated English house, the place seems to be haunted, she neurotically locks the doors. So far so good.

But - and this is a really big but - the attempt at a scary socko finale falls flat enough that you could slide it under a door. Let's not mince words, if you've seen ""The Sixth Sense"", your reaction to this movie will be ""Seen it!"" What's more, that far superior horror film had its own, involving plot, and the surprise at the end came as a surprise; you probably didn't see it coming (at least, I didn't) even though subtle clues were dropped throughout. ""The Others"", by contrast, makes it abundantly clear that ""we're leading up to a big shocker ending!"" That lead-up IS the plot of the movie, and when it comes, it doesn't seem very original, or even all that scary.

Decent opening, bad payoff.",1022976000,3,1215,4.699530516431925

Isn't a script suppose to have a plot? (Not as a plot in the ground, as in  a story that is developed.)This ditty rambles on in a
predictable manner and meanwhile Kidman just gets more shrill. Oh please. Enough. Thank goodness even money couldn't buy her a best actress award.

 A mother and her two children are living in a secluded mansion that sooner or later becomes haunting right when a family of three move in, becoming the servants. Definitely don't want to go any further, that way the film will be suspenseful all the way. It moves a little slow, but without blood and slashes coming from here and there, Nicole Kidman's screams and scenes are still chilling to the bone.

1313190,5,B00003CYLJ,"Alejandro Amenabar is the creative genius behind the Cruise/Wagner sleeper hit, The Others starring Nicole Kidman. I hadn't seen this film in the theatres and fortunately, no one had spoiled the ending for me. Thank God, because part of this movies attraction is the way the plot unfolds little by little, setting up a mystery that's a lot of fun to guess at. It's a truly ""Hitchcockian"" storyline that teases the audience throughout the film. I had to watch this film twice to pick up on all the subtle clues.
Aside from the great story, the acting in this film is fantastic. I've heard people say that Nicole Kidman is the star of this movie, but the one who really shines is new comer Alkina Mann who plays Kidmans daughter. Her reactions are so real and geniune you forget she's an actor playing a character.
This movie is also scary. If the Blair Witch Project had you squirming and you liked The Sixth Sense, this movie will have you jumping out of your skin in some places.
It's amazing to think that this is Alejandro Amenabars first English speaking movie. Not only that but he wrote it, directed it AND did the music for it, which is nicely stark, baroque and very beautiful in some places. A true cinematic Masterpiece.

1313191,5,B00003CYLJ,"This movie has a number of levels, many of which are not immediately apparent because of the excellent acting, near perfect casting and exquisite cinematography.  On the artistic level the movie will appeal more to artists and writers, and to those who enjoy a well crafted plot and a surprise ending.
On another level, though, this movie will inspire a self examination of how one perceives realities. It does this by exposing the filters and assumptions that we all use when observing and mentally correlating those observations with our knowledge of fact into our realities.  It also has an obvious message about coexistence and acceptance.
Regardless of whether or not one believes in the supernatural, the story and the ending will be completely unexpected for most who watch this movie. The many clues wrapped in foreshadowing and other plot devices will not make sense until the end, but if you carefully examine them a day or so after watching this movie you'll have some keen insights into your own unique set of filters and assumptions that you use daily.
There are other levels and messages within this movie that will surface days or weeks after watching it, such as the way the female characters are portrayed as more proactive, central figures than the male characters.  The movie also challenges religious beliefs in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. I am not sure if this is yet another subtle layer of the plot or if it reflects the views and biases of the writers and director - but these elements are there.
If you enjoy great dialog and a masterful story with an interesting plot that is presented with beautiful visuals then you'll love this movie on an artistic level.

I'm not going to compare it to the Sixth Sense or to the old Hitchcock movies either.  What struck out at me the most ALL THROUGHOUT the film was the political and historical undertones that served as a subtext to the action and dialogue of the characters.  The film takes place right after World War II - in Ireland - during the period that the British Empire was beginning to see the restlessness of its colonies and the rumblings for independence.  It is unmistakable that Kidman's character can be likened to that of the imperial British Empire, which no matter how hard it tries, cannot shelter or protect Her colonies forever. For Grace, she is beginning to lose control of her life and the authority she holds over shielding her kids from the outside world. Her son and daughter play the roles of the long-suffering colonies under the British autocracy. Then along come 3 wise old 'veterans' who can see what's in store because they remember from the past.  They are akin to the revolutionaries and free-thinkers of the colonies that try to cry out for freedom and independence.  After World War II, Britian's empire (like Grace and her family) was dying or perhaps already dead.  With the independence of Her colonies, Britain was beginning to come to grips of their ""new"" role in an ""old"" world (Grace's vast mansion). .... DO NOT watch it in hopes of gory special effects or teen-slasher elements.  Watch it rather for some genuine suspense, sharp dialogue, brilliant cinematography, and a stunning score.

1313299,4,B00003CYLJ,"The Others effectively combines the qualities of many traditional haunted house genre movies with an original twist. The atmosphere of the film is more gothic --say, along the lines of Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel or even Wuthering Heights (minus the romance) than modern horror with the emphasis on blood, special effects and stacks of butchered teenagers. Nicole Kidman is brilliant as a high-strung woman living in an isolated, eerie old house with her two sheltered children. When three new servants arrive, spooky things begin to occur. There are also intimations of tragic events in the past which are not revealed until the end. This film is a welcome alternative to the Friday the 13th variety of horror movie. It allows us to use our imagination rather than overwhelming us with gore. A sense of dread persists, mainly revealed in small things like an old photo album or a foggy path in the woods. And The Others is not all atmosphere with no plot --the film is definitely headed somewhere and the conclusion will not disappoint you (unless you simply don't enjoy this type of film).",1022457600,2,1089,4.891891891891892

Comparisions with movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" is inevitable but this movie stands on its own.
Without a drop of blood being spilled, ""The Others"" manages to be one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. Even though I figured out what was going on around the time the two children jump out of their windows for a little night exploration, it was still a thrill to watch the whole thing unfold. And speaking of the two children, they were both incredible actors. I hope I see more of them in years to come.

Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) was quite similar, and far superior, as were the two ""English"" haunted house movies that come to mind (""The Innocents"", ""The Uninvited""). From a 2001 perspective, I'm so completely impressed that elements of my 3 favorite haunted-house films have resurfaced so intelligently today without resorting to smarmy fake CGI effects. Most of the credit must go to Alejandro Amenabar, director and visionary (he also ""wrote"" the score...with the help of a computer...to eerie and substantial effect). Amenabar controlled the slow descent into abject terror so perfectly that I was totally taken in. Other reviewers suggested that the ending was obvious..sorry, I kept my mind a little more open to the flow of events. Nicole Kidman was justly given kudos for this performance, and I was very impressed with Fionnula Flannigan as the housekeeper. But the real treats here are the performances of two absolutely superb kid actors, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Nothing annoys me more than bad kid actors; these two were brilliant: natural and genuinely convincing...a rarity! The 2-disc DVD has a great transfer of the film; the 2nd disc has some extra ""stuff"", though not enough to warrant an extra disc. One interesting ""extra"" is an explanation of XP (Xeroderma Pigmentosum), which I found interesting because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, and one of his best heroes suffered from this (""Fear Nothing"" and its sequel ""Seize the Night""). There's also a fine background regarding Amenabar and his methods in directing the film. I'm not going to explain those previous comments, because I don't want to blab-away any plot-points.

The story is in many ways rather absurdly ""set up"" (children unable to be exposed to light, strange servants arriving unannounced and so on) but this is the way of this kind of film. The acting is excellent and it is very spooky indeed. I particularly liked the Victorian ""book of the dead"" - very gothic and a splendid touch. The location of the house seems ridiculous to me - the island of Jersey is known largely for its good weather (in British terms anyway), so endless fog is unlikely - but this is a gothic type film, so I am being too picky perhaps. The end is nicely done and in a strange way a happy surprise. It could have been much worse. There is a propensity for films to stress the supernatural these days - I just hope that this is not too much of a trend. In my opinion we have one life and we have to make the best of this world - there is no other.

The problem was this movie was insulting to anyone with a mind. It lacked everything and I rate it up with the Spice World Movie.

It does not rely on blood and gore to scare the wits out of you, instead it ""messes with your mind"" (as a friend of mine said).  Quite frankly, Nicole Kidman should have been nominated for the Oscar for THIS performance--she pulled off the role of the ""troubled mother"" wonderfully.
For anyone wanting a smart, stylish, scary movie (and I hate to use the words ""scary"" because it conjures up images of the '80s slash flicks), I would highly recommend it.",1021766400,2,713,4.51937984496124
1313489,5,B00003CYLJ,"This is one of those movies that  needs a bit of restraint in the review because it would be a shame to spoil that final plot twist that brings all the mystery together into a first rate ending. I'm usually suspicious of people who say things like that about movies or books, but in this case, as in the case of The Sixth Sense, it's definitely the truth.
The Others reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's movies in the way that one scene builds upon another scene and on and on until you're hooked and couldn't stop watching even if you wanted to. There's suspense, mystery, clues that seem to make no sense, wonderfully complex characters, and the perfect spooky and disturbing, yet beautiful, mansion in which the story  all takes place.
Nicole Kidman is very convincing and perfectly cast in the lead role of The Others. She is surrounded by an equally excellent supporting cast, particularly the boy and girl who play her children. But I think the main star of this movie is the house. I found it fascinating to go from room to room and observe what each one revealed about the people who lived there and the plot that was unfolding.
I thought The Others was a unique movie that could certainly be compared to The Sixth Sense, but I think it stands alone as a creative and satisfying piece of work. I think the difference between these two films is that in The Others you can't be sure that anything is what it seems to be while in The Sixth Sense it is exactly what it appears to be. The trick is in how soon you figure out what that means. In my case, I had to wait for the ending.",1021766400,,1583,4.36271186440678

You got to respect that it doesnt use CGI! Anyways, this is a MUST buy 2 DISC DVD SET for all horror, and haunted house fans. This is Nicole Kidman's best performance, EVER! And, this movie doesnt have too much music, so its mainly performance-driven. I really think Hollywood is getting over the teenie-bopper faze it was going through. First, Jeepers Creepers brought back the 80s, Session 9, the 70s, and The Others, the 40s and 50s. Thats a good sign! Anyways, you MUST buy this movie! This film has plenty of scares ( imagine The Haunting (remake) with twice as many scares!) and suspenseful scenes, such as footsteps moving around, doors opening by themselves, etc. And, I must say the creepiest part of the movie was probably when Nicole was looking at the Book of the Dead, which showed  old pictures of dead people dressed in black and white (brrr! creepy!)

Nicole Kidman plays Grace, mother of two children Anne & Nicholas. Both of the children are photosensitive and can't have exposure to the sun. Grace's husband Charles went to war and hasn't come back, she's had no news from him.
Grace is a person with strict Catholic ideals, however near the end she is left not knowing what to believe.
Three people come to the house looking for work, Mrs. Mills, Lydia a mute (played by Elaine Cassidy from ""Felicia's Journey"" another good movie!) & Mr. Tuttle, Grace tells them all their servants left suddenly, not even taking their pay checks.
Anne, the little girl insists there's a boy named Victor in the house, Grace doesn't believe in ghosts and Nicholas thinks she's just trying to scare him. In one scene we hear Victor's voice and see his hand, but left with the impression that it is perhaps just Anne trying to frighten her brother.
Grace starts to hear voices, a child crying, doors opening, curtains opening, someone running back and forth over head, she first suspects it's the new servants, or perhaps some people have broken in, maybe she's just crazy...Anne told Mrs Mills that a while ago ""mummy went mad"".

1313494,4,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is a superb ghost story with the best twist ending since ""The Sixth Sense"". It has no dazzling special effects. Instead, it relies on atmosphere [darkness and shadows, fog, sounds, a malevolent old house], a literate script and great acting. Because it is somewhat old-fashioned and because its pace isn't lightening fast, it's at least as appealing to adults as it is to teens.
Grace Stewart lives in a vast, isolated mansion on an island off the coast of England with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband has yet to come home from the recently ended W.W.II. The children have a disease that makes them allergic to bright light. All the curtains must be drawn in any room they are in. Doors must be kept closed. The servants have recently vanished in the night, leaving the high-strung, fanatically religious Grace alone to care for the kids. It is a lonely and claustrophobic existence. Help arrives in the form of three servants who once worked in the house years before the Stewarts moved in. Before long, Anne claims that she's seeing strange people in the house. Grace refuses to believe her until even odder events occur. And the three servants, who at first seemed so kind and caring, become somehow threatening. What on earth is going on? Or is it of this earth?
Nicole Kidman is mesmerizing as Grace Stewart. She is in nearly every scene. Her character is a difficult one that vacillates between loving mother and screaming banshee. At the hands of a less accomplished actress, the role might have produced some unintentional laughter, but Ms. Kidman makes us feel empathy and compassion for sad, unhappy Grace. Also of note are Alakina Mann as Anne and Fionula Flanigan as Bertha Mills, one of the mysterious servants. Like Bette Davis and Meryl Streep, Kidman is an extremely versatile and powerful actress, but Mann and Flanigan manage to hold their own with her admirably.
""The Others"" was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, a young Spaniard whose 1997 film, ""Abre les ojos"" was recently remade by Cameron Crowe as ""Vanilla Sky"". He also wrote the music. His accomplished, sophisticated score adds a great deal to the film. He's a remarkable talent.",1021680000,,2203,4.8773333333333335

Voices are heard, pianos play on their own and stange sounds lead the family to believe they may not be ""alone"".

Set in a dark, gloomy English estate in the year 1945, The Other is a story about a woman named Grace Stewart (Kidman) who still waits for her husband to return from the war against Germany.  She guardedly protects her two children, Ann and Nicholas, who are ""photosensitive.""  One day, three strangers show up in answer to an ad for servants.  After the strangers arrive, odd things start happening, from voices being heard everywhere, to strange noises.
All along, Grace appears to become more and more paranoid, and the three strangers become more and more enigmatic and sinister (although they don't appear to do anything wrong).  The suspense continues to build, until the surprise ending.  I can't say anymore without blowing it for people who haven't seen this movie.
Nicole Kidman turns in  teriffic performance as Grace, the over-protective, paranoid, and borderline crazy mother.  The rest of the cast play their parts well, though I was hoping to see more of Chistopher Eccleston (Gone in 60 Seconds).  Great camera work, and a gloomy set combine to create a creepy and frantic atmosphere.
Don't rent this if you are looking for a Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St. type of movie.  However, if you like gothic-like suspense, and trying to stay a step ahead of the movie by predicting the outcome, you'll love this show.  The most recent movie that The Others resembles is The Sixth Sense.

1313497,5,B00003CYLJ,"...This is one of those thriller/horror movies that loves to play with the audiences' minds. And I loved how it twisted mine around and threw it back in my face.
The story revolves around a young lady (Nicole Kidman) and her two children who live in a home off the England coast.  Her husband is away fighting in WWII, leaving Nicole and her kids alone in a Gothic home with the ambience of Dracula's summer home.  Add to this the medical condition of Xeroderma Pigmentosum (allergy to light) that the children have, and it makes for some dark scenes that keep you gripping your seat or loved one's hand with excessive force.
Enter Fionnula Flanagan (a house maid/nanny)--- who brings along two other caretakers.  She has a dusky presence that sits uneasily with you the moment she's seen on screen.  As are her two 'assistants' (one of whom is a mute for unknown reasons... in the beginning).
The house begins to take on a personality of its own soon after the arrival of these new servants. The children begin seeing strange people, whom Nicole can't visualize for some reason.  Bumps, creaks, mysterious piano concertos, slamming doors and a curious constant fog all add to an eerie sense that all is rotten in Denmark (or Jersey?).
The last fifteen minutes of the film will make you breath a sigh of...what?  Relief?  Emotional exhaustion?  A gasping understanding?  Thankful that you can finally pee normally again?  Definitely all of the afore mentioned.
A+ performances from Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, and the two children in this incredible feature film.  One that I'm proud to say I now own...on DVD.",1021593600,,1616,4.84

As a result I bought this film sight unseen due to Ms. Kidman's talent, and because of the hype.  I was also aware that there was a shocking ending and I really didn't want that to be ruined for me as other films have been.  The film is set in the 1940's and I'll admit that when it started I felt the urge to snooze.  That urge quickly ended and I was knee deep in suspense.  Ms. Kidman plays Grace, a mother of two who appears to be very controlling and at the same time very vulnerable.  Grace is staying in a mansion waiting for her husband to return from war.  No big surprise here, the house is haunted.  Once the story begins to unravel, the viewer is desperately trying to figure out what is going on and what is real and what is not.

Amenabar really delivers the goods. The fantastic Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a rather cold, icey mother of two who lives in a large and spooky mansion circa 1945. She has hired three new servants to help in her home after her previous employees just vanished. Just left. Her children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and suffocate if they come in contact with light. Because of this, the house curtains are pulled and the place is usually in the dark. Spooky. The little girl believes the place is haunted when she keeps seeing people. Her mother and brother refuse to hear it. Strange things begin to happen and they only get more and more odd until Grace is forced to believe her daughter. The movie is great. Nicole Kidman gives the best performance of her career. She is no longer ""Mrs. Tom Cruise"" and this movie proves it. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is clearly wrong. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Moulin Rouge"", but she deserved it more for this performance. The acting and accent are dead on perfect. The kids are great. We don't see such great kid actors too often, but these two were very good. I could listen to their accents all day. The movie looks really good and is shot magnificently. A gorgeous looking movie. It's full of interesting plot turns that ends in a surprise climax that beats the hell out of the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"". The one star review below is ridiculous beyond belief. The house and fog are shot incredibly. The atmosphere of this film is just as important and thrilling as the actors and the action. The music is superb as well. This movie, along with Alejandro's superb direction and storytelling, tells you that you can have a truly epic, scary, mysterious, and overall satisfying movie experience with the things that you don't see, as much as the other movies filled with make-up, special effects, and CGI computer generated effects. The best kind of thriller are the ones about true fear that make you create it in your own mind. Not spoon fed to you by eye popping Hollywood tricks and camera trickery. All you need is a solid story and good actors. This movie has those things and then some. Superbly done folks. If you like a good haunted house movie, this one is the best in eons. As I've already said before, this is the best thriller I've seen in many a moon. The people who didn't get it are laughable. This movie is wasted on them. I suggest they go back to watching ""Temptation Island"". Make yourself a bowl of popcorn, get comfy on the couch, turn off the lights, and get ready for an immensley enjoyable thriller.

What I got was a first rate ghost story that scared the bejeezus out of me the whole way through.  One of the most memorable moments is the new take on the ""creepy attic scene.""  This one is just as scary, but in FULL daylight!

This movie keeps you guessing, and the surprise ending makes this one of the best I've seen.  Nicole Kidman is amazing in this, adding sympathy to a character who could be turned into a ""Mommy Dearest"" or cardboard cut-out in the wrong hands.

Unfortunately, the DVD is a bit of a waste of space.  The special features could easily be placed on one disc alongside the movie.  While the documentary on XP (not the OS) is good, there are surprisingly few features for an entire second disc.

I wasn't prepared for the ending, so that was a surprise as well.
  The basic premise of the movie? Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) is living in a house with her 2 children, awaiting the return of her husband who is lost at war. Her children can't be exposed to light and so the curtains must be kept closed - which only adds to the dark and foreboding atmosphere.  The children are hypersensitive to light and have lived in a musty manor with curtains and shutters perpetually drawn.
  Grace's daughter keeps speaking of a child she sees and of other ghosts as well, bringing about her mother's wrath - until slowly, slowly, it becomes clear that something strange is going on in the house. But what? I won't give away any of the important details but I WILL say that this one may not go in a totally expected direction so don't assume you know the ending until the last few minutes.

The main thing with this film is its unexpected ending, which is very reminiscent of The Sixth Sense.

I read reviews where people seemed to find this film boring. If you're seeing this film expecting Predator (an excellent film in its own genre, nonetheless) then yes, it is boring. If you're expecting a well-paced thriller that takes time to develop and explodes at its climax, watch The Others.

That said, I managed to work out at about the time that Christopher Eccleston (one of the best actors in Britain, by the way) arrived on the scene how the ending was gonna work out, and even though I was right about it I wasn't that boshed because as a whole the film was very stylish and moody and evocative and that was the main thing about it.",1021507200,,643,4.366666666666666

Set in the Edwardian era, great care was invested in presenting an authentic feel of the period. I just saw the film for the first time last night on DVD and am suitably impressed. What makes this a true gem is the creepy, sinister quality evoked. It is not dependent on gore, nor gruesome spectacle, but masterfully developes a growing dread. Where other spookfests delve into rather absurd territory, depending more on special effects and gross anatomy rendered truly gross, this movie weaves a tension that creates a psychological landscape for the fear that emerges.
The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating is the disappointing audio quality on the DVD. Folks look to DVD because both visual and audio quality tend to be excellent. Unfortunately, the audio on this DVD leaves much to be desired. Note to producers: Invest in a few good VU meters!
Most of the film is so quiet that I really had to crank my amplifier rather high just to hear what was being said. Then, along comes a fairly noisy scene, and I was nearly blasted out of my easy chair! Some consistency in volume levels would vastly improve the overall enjoyment of the DVD.

You know a moody, atmospheric picture that is paced in such a way that the horror and discomfort of the plot are underlined and the viewer is kept on edge. Boy was I wrong!
It was a total snoozefest for me but then maybe you like shoddy and confusing exposition set at a snail's pace. If you rent/buy this movie or some so called ""friend"" makes you watch it with them then just be familiar enough with your remote so you can find the fast-forward button in the dark. Or go buy one of those cool glowy remotes because trust me, You're. Going. To. Need. That. Button.
I lost count of all the ""thrilling"" scenes of Grace, the main character slowly, SLOWLY walking up the stairs following ghostly whispers only to caaaarefully open the door to find (SURPRISE) well to quote Bart Simpson the thing that would be scarier than what she finds (any of the 5 billion times this scene happens)is ANYTHING. Actually there may have just been one scene like that. It might still be going on! I might have fallen asleep watching this dumb movie waiting for something exciting to happen. Maybe I'm dreaming about writing this review when actually I'm passed out on my couch. Drool is probably streaming down my chin while Nicole Kidman looks fretful and takes another micrometer step up those damn stairs.
The writer/director was obviously trying to mimic the hold your breath suspense of The Shining. Where you didn't know everything about the plot at first, but it didn't matter. You knew something was WRONG in that hotel and you were scared of it! The difference is that movie remembered to give you glimpses of scary stuff to remind you it was a thriller/horror. In this case it's plain to see the writer got an idea for a great shocking ending and then tried to construct a story around it. But it doesn't work the only thrilling part of this movie (being confused by crypic mixed messages about character motives doesn't count as a thrill does it?) is when they finally reveal the plot twist. But that doesn't work either because you know it's coming. You go the whole movie not knowing anything that by the time they feel like giving you a clue you're too bored to care.
2 stars for the whole movie, 3 1/2 for the last 15 minutes and 4 stars for the fog, very haunting and symbolic.
Skip this movie and rent something else try Mulholland Drive, or Waking Life.",1021420800,5,2538,4.543668122270742
1313665,5,B00003CYLJ,Today is the day this movie came out on video. I rented it. I just watched it. This is sure to be a classic in our own time. Set in 1945 it might as well been filmed then. Coz it harks back the spirits of Hollywood scary movie past. Very gloriously so. It proves that don't need graphic violence to be scary. A little bit of advice to modern Hollywood. Not often anymore does a movie make you jump. This one does and on numerous occasions. It is very atmospheric. Many sight pranks is pulled on the viewer. I could tell you them but then that would ruin the exsperiance. Why it wasn't nominated for oscars i will never know. Nicole Kidmen is Brillant. The children are the best performances by children that i seen in a good long time. Mostly the little girl. Watch it in the dark if you dare. And have fun. Or cuddle up close to the one you love.

Nicole Kidman is fantastic as a mother who's  raising her 2 children by herself when her husband went off to war. She's stuck living in a huge mansion where her children start seeing and hearing other people. She refuses to believe it herself until she starts experienceing it herself. What makes The Others better than those other movise I mentioned is that it plays with your head and makes you think about who's really the ghosts and who's actually the ones being haunted.",1021334400,,730,4.658914728682171

The setting in the dark, dank castle with thick fog surrounding all day and night provided an appropriate backdrop to the ensuing horror thoughout.  The story itself was extremely creative and the fear that it instills in its viewers is done through tasteful ghostly theatrics, rather than blood, guts, and gore, which in my opinion is more realistic and evokes a real chill in one's bones.

1313671,4,B00003CYLJ," ""The Others"" is a thriller that takes place in the 1940's in a haunted house.  The story revolves around Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children Anne and Nicholas.  Grace and her children have been abandoned by her husband who left and has yet to return from fighting in the World War.  The family lives alone in a very large, old house, where the drapes are always closed, the rooms are always locked, and everything is very silent.  The reason for the drapes and the locks-- Grace's children are somehow allergic to light.  If exposed to light, the children would develop sores, have difficulty breathing, and possibly die.  To Grace, the house is like a ship and the light is like water...every adjoining door must be closed and locked to ensure no light will touch the children.  The house must also be very silent because Grace gets very bad migraines.

  Grace is very strict with the children and often makes them read from the Bible.  Grace is particularly strict about lying, which seems to be a problem with Anne.  Anne loves to frighten her younger brother by telling him ghost stories. She sometimes even pretends that there are ghosts in the room and she will have conversations with them.  Anne gets into trouble often because she always talks about ghosts.

  Living alone in a dark house with two children is a difficult job so Grace hires three servants, Lydia (a mysterious mute), Mrs. Mills, and Mr. Tuttle.  It is fortunate for Grace that these particular three servants answered her add in the paper because they worked at the house previously and are very familiar with the layout-- working in the dark less of a problem for them.  Once the servants arrive strange things start to occur-- doors are left open and unlocked, drapes are opened, and Grace hears loud noises.  At first, she blames the servants, but Anne is adamant that the disturbances are due to the ghosts.  Refusing to believe this, Grace and the servants search the entire house to find the intruder who must be hiding out.  They find nothing....and then more strange things occur and Grace starts to believe that the house is haunted.  To tell more would ruin the movie....

  ""The Others"" is a classic haunted house thriller.  The acting is well done, the scenery is appropriately spooky, and the story twists, turns, and becomes more and more mysterious.  The film may leave you with some questions but not really because of plot holes...mostly because the story is so interesting and different.  If you like a good ghost story see this film and you will not be disappointed.",1020902400,,2571,4.753393665158371

Enter three mysterious strangers, who get themselves hired on as the woman's cleaning staff. That's when the shenanigans begin.  Nicole Kidman turns in her best work since TO DIE FOR, far stronger and more subtle than that overbloated MOULIN ROUGE mess--this should have been the film to get her the Oscar nod.

I watched it at 3 in the morning on my own and I had to grab my cat for comfort. I'll watch it again.",1020124800,3,257,3.8679245283018866
1313762,5,B00003CYLJ,"Yesterday, on April 28, we have finally seen the theatrical release of this masterpiece in Japan, and the waiting time was very, very long.  But it was worth of our patience.  ""The Others"" is not only a chilling and scary movie; it is crafted with style and intelligence, and it is fantastic to watch the director (who is still below the age of 30!!) create this piece of art.
As you probably have known by now, beautiful Nicole Kidman  plays Grace, whose children are allergic to light (and this disaease really exists, you should know).  With ritual-like meticulous rules, she manages her household works, employing new servants in a huge, dreary countryhouse, which ever-hanging fogs mystriously surround.  But there is (or are), she comes to know, some intruder(s) here, of which existence her children are convinced.  And sooner or later, Grace comes to feel that, too.
It is a natural but unfair comparison if you point out that ""The Others"" resembles at some places a certain Oscar-nominated film, because the director Amenabar does it with completely different touch.  I cannot tell you much, but let me say, like Hitchcock's classic ""Rebecca,"" the heroine (and the audience) is lured inexplicably into the mystery of the old house and its past.  Also using the classic frameworks of ghost stories used in the original ""Haunting"" (Robert Wise version, NOT THAT remake), the film makes us jumping in the seats, sending lots of chill in spine, and, moreover, it treats a universal subject of love between mother and children in a subtle fashion.  On top of that, the film goes further, to make the mother Grace not exactly an ideal one for kids, and it succeeds eventually in depicting the fraility of humans -- in short, you really don't know what you think you know.
Anchored by strong and believable acting given from underrated Nicole Kidman (why did Oscar ignore her work here, preferring  that musical ... well, but all right, I understand), and aided effectively by other well-cast players whose uncanny presence unnerve us greatly, ""The Others"" will rivet your eyes on the screen, especially when you are a connoisseur of old-fashioned horror film.  Keep your eyes open when you see the details of the film: furniture, photoes, everything.  Something is wrong with this house, but how and what is not clear.  This bizzare sensation is another asset of the film, and you will find what you missed with repeated viewing.
For those who have enjoyed this (and I bet you did), the story is perhaps inspired by Henry James's novella ""Turn of the Screw,"" which deals with the similar situation.  You may as well read that equally well-crafted, creepy story.
Trivia: look closely at one of the old photoes of the dead: one of the three men on the bed is director Amenabar himself  (and one of the others is Mateo Gil, director of Spanish film ""Nadie conoce a nadie"" of which music Amenabar composed, and of which star Eduardo Noriega was featured in the two previous Amenabar film in Spain, ""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes.""  The former one is a must-see for anyone loving blood-curdling thriller.  But hey, appearing in a photo?  This is exactly what Hitchcock did in one of his earlier films about a life-boat, another masterpiece about the people in a confined place !!  Surely Amenabar loves his master.",1019952000,10,3310,4.8680926916221035
1313763,5,B00003CYLJ,"Often touted as a horror movie The Others is actually a gently creeping period piece.  Set in 1945 on the island of Jersey, Grace (Kidman) and her two children live by themselves in a lonely house surrounded by fog and bad weather.  After all the servants suddenly leave in the night Grace hires three new ones, informing them that the windows and doors must always be closed to protect the two children, both of whom are allergic to daylight.  Things begin to unravel as one of the children claims to see a little boy and his family and mysterious things start happening around the house.
What makes this movie particularly special is the fact that it sets its audience on edge rather than outright scares them.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is built up as the characters are all literally kept behind closed doors and the dingy photography depicts the monotonous life that the family lead.  However, it is Kidman that really holds it together.  Giving a blistering performance of a woman on the edge of insanity, desperate to retain her decorum whilst the absence of her husband gnaws at her.  Definitely very different to her role as a courtesan in Moulin Rouge, this shows what breadth the actress has, which anyone who has watched To Die For will know.  Thankfully the rest of the cast are very good indeed, especially the two children.
The feeling of mystery and locked-away feelings is evoked well as were given pieces of the puzzle gradually throughout the film.  Furthermore, The Others has created a whole new genre in its reliance of flesh-crawling creepiness rather than gratuitous gore.  It certainly makes a refreshing change and is all the better for having an actress of Kidmans calibre on board.",1019865600,,1711,4.828767123287672

Although it lacks fast paced sceens for most of the movie, the 3 or 4 sceens that are fast paced are very good and the suspense of the sceens really comes through the screen at you. What really makes the movie is the ending, its the kind of ending that your just like ""WOW"". You don't see it coming at all, and it really catches you off guard.

From the awesome visuals, to the amazing performance by Nicole Kidman, to the creepy score, the believable kids, the genuinely engaging story-line, to the goosebumps that I got during several key scenes, I loved every aspect of this film, and its final denouement only concretized all of that for me.
I love movies like this because there's a sense of reality behind them, a believability factor with an actual capacity to tap into some of our most unknown fears. The truth about ghosts, the afterworld, haunted houses...are notions that none of us could pretend to factually know much about, but movies as such always seem to crack open the greater possibilities in our minds.

on special effects much for its creepy feel{which i like too,sometimes!},but more on the acting,atmosphere and its
somewhat mature subject matter.
This isn't no run of the mill haunted house film like The
Haunting,House on Haunted Hill or Thirteen Ghosts{which i wasn't

Grace(Kidman) and her daughter and son live in a mansion during World War II and one day she hires 3 people to do some help around the house, ghost encounters and mishapes insues.  And that's all I'm going to say about the story because the lest you know about it, the better.

1313993,5,B00003CYLJ,"Unfortunately if I'm not going to give anything away, then it's hard to explain this movie to you. I think everyone knows it's a ghost story. The movie stars Nicole Kidman who's the mother of two children, a boy and a girl. They have a huge manor in the English country side. Now I stop. If I tell you anymore I'll give it away. The family has some visitors, and it gets very chilling. This is an excellent representation of a haunting. If you've ever heard any ghost stories or seen ghost movies, the hauntings get rather unbelievable. This one will have you checking under your bed at night. Both my boyfriend and I jumped and screamed aloud a couple of times. If you don't scream, you'll at least jump. It'll have your blood pumping and on edge the whole way. If you like suspense you'll love this movie. It's a great date movie, if you want your girl to cling to your arm, and it's all around fun.
For the children, I'd say it's a very clean movie. It's not gory at all, but it is scary. If your children get nightmares from movies I wouldn't take them, but if they like scary movies, by all means, bring them to this one. It's an adult kind of scary in that it makes you think and it's not just some ghost running around with a meat cleaver chopping heads off. If you want that there are plenty of cheap thrillers in the local video store. This one will have your spine crawling instead. This is for anyone who has sat up in bed at night to a thump and wondered what it was, or thought that just maybe they saw something move that shouldn't have. It's subtle, but that's why it's so good.
I'd be very careful about letting anyone tell you the plot of the movie, just go see it. I don't think you'll be disappointed, I certainly wasn't.

I went to the movie in theaters with high expectations, and expected to be dazzled, horrified, and come out of the theater feeling something.  Yet all I felt was utter disappointment.  For one, Kidman's performance is anything but Oscar-worthy.  The hype for her performance in this film does not even come close to the well-deserved hype she gained from her exquisitely beautiful performance in ""Moulin Rouge.""  And secondly, I found ""The Others"" to be nothing more than a rather cheap, dreary old-fashioned re-make of ""The Sixth Sense,"" a far superior film.  ""The Others"" revolves around a predictable storyline and a less than mediocre cast.  The rest of the cast members seem to all be hanging by a thread, hoping that Nicole Kidman's performance will keep this movie afloat.  Well, I'm sorry - no matter how good Kidman is (or, in this case, isn't) nothing can bring this movie out of the slump that it has created for itself.  It works off of a script which pretends to be ingenious, a cast that imagines itself as spectacular, and an ending that, quite frankly, I had figured out within the first half hour of the film.  So, while Kidman scores huge in ""Moulin Rouge,"" she fails miserably in ""The Others,"" which can simply be described as the ""other"" Sixth Sense - no pun intended, of course...",1016323200,8,1410,4.733606557377049

Nicole Kidman really proved she can act in this one. The twist at the end was great, too. I didn't expect it and didn't see it coming. I loved the movie!
I agree with the other reviewers. This movie is atmospheric, spooky, well-acted, well-produced and just plain fun to watch. The swirling mists and fog that surround the main characters provide a palpable feeling of claustrophobia that added to the eeriness.
I can't say much more than this because I don't want to reveal too much of the plot.

1313999,5,B00003CYLJ,"2001 was definitely Nicole Kidman's year at the cinema. Not only was she superbly magical and delightful in MOULIN ROUGE, but she turned up the chill factor in THE OTHERS. Even if you've heard it was like The Sixth Sense, it really stands on its own from it and other modern suspense films.
Not only is the acting from all the cast excellent, visually, THE OTHERS' set design and lighting heighten the atmosphere of foreboding. The exterior shots reminded me of the 70s horror classic Legend Of Hell House. The cinematographic style lets the story unfold moment by moment, keeping you enthralled in what is to come, all the way to the final few minutes.
What struck me as odd (in a good way) is how much Nicole Kidman resembles Grace Kelly from her 50s movies, in several of the movie's scenes. I think it was her wardrobe and hair styles that gave me that impression. In any case Nicole Kidman's look and performance really fit her character, both emotionally and psychologically.

Its pacing is agonizingly slow, it's derivative and, ultimately, tedious.  Thematically, it's a wannabe ""The Innocents""--the classic Jack Clayton version of The Turn of the Screw, with Deborah Kerr turning in an exquisitely neurasthenic performance. A third of the way into this film, it's fairly obvious what's going on. Yet it's dragged out relentlessly to its foregone conclusion.

The plot is quite simple, but extremely effective, very realistic, and genuinely scary. The climax, and final twist is stunning. I really should have seen it coming! (because it's the oldest ghost-story twist in the book!)
The story plays with your mind, as all good ghost stories / mysteries should. All the way through i find myself pondering what could possibly be going on and why. Everytime something happened i would think ""ah yes, that must be it"" but every single time i was wrong. And every single time i was wrong, i enjoyed the experience.

1314140,5,B00003CYLJ,I saw The Others back last summer in the theater. I came out of the theater creeped out. The movie takes place back during the war. Nicole Kidman and her family live in a huge old house that her daughter says is inhabited by ghosts. Nicole Kidman thinks it's he daughter playing a joke for attention. Well she think that until she notices the wierd things happening. This movie i for mature horror film fans. It's not for those who got scared during movies like The Haunting. This movie gets the thrills just right and the twist(which no one should reveal)is so unpredictable that when you see it you just won't even believe it. The performances in the movie are flawless.

1314142,4,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is one of those olds-school horror films that shines beyond the modern superficiality of the genre, and that is pretty much all critics have had to say for it.  It does indeed scare--exactly what it is intended to do--without glitzy special effects and over-the-top ghosts.  It is instead, so exceedingly simple, its focus is so intensely minimalist, that many consider the film to be rather slow developing, and comes across long and tedious.  I heartily disagree:  at an hour and forty-five minutes, nothing seems long; and rather than being anything like slow and tedious, it is COMPLETE, perhaps the greatest compliment I can bestow on a film.  The Others tells every story it wants to tell, and it tells it very well; for that reason it succeeds in its intention.
Indeed, when you are confined to a mansion with a small, select group of characters, there is not much exploration of outside areas and topics; but this film obviously doesn't need to do that.  Sure the film takes its time, but since it always knows where its going, and it always gets there, the film cannot be criticized for that reason.  And it is all bound together by good efforts on both sides of the camera.  If at the very least, the housekeepers come across as detrimentally eccentric, then at least Nicole Kidman portrays her character superbly.  Without superb actors in the children, the film would have been ruined; fortunately, both the boy and the girl steal every moment they appear on screen.  Moreover, director Amenabar manages to keep the shots diverse, despite the monotony of some of the locations; subtle motion and deliberate pans do a lot to keep the action moving.  Amenabar, playing triple duty on this film, also deserves much credit for his score to The Others, which is haunting to say the least, uncharacteristic for sure, and just memorable enough to follow you from the theatre.  (Note: when humming, the children are always singing the main theme from the film.)
And so the finished product to this movie may be too little for some to handle, but those with the patience will discover an elaborate, character-driven film that relies heavily on the feeling of fear rather than its visualization.  Indeed, this movie could have very easily become boring, had not every actor and filmmaker on bored been so completely competent in his or her tasks.  Moreover, it is exceedingly scary.  It's always a delight to hear a theatre audience scream simultaneously, then all share an embarrassed chuckle afterwards.  The Others does this and several times over.  In short, it succeeds effectively as the kind of horror movie that Hollywood likes to neglect;  I hope you won't neglect it too.",1013817600,3,2694,4.883516483516484
1314143,4,B00003CYLJ,"Just when we all thought we'd seen the back of the good old fashioned creepy ghost story along comes The Others, a good old fashioned creepy ghost story. Starring Nicole Kidman in her second great role and performance of the year (if you haven't already checked out Moulin Rouge you should).
The Others was the surprise sleeper hit of Fall 2001. Directed by Spaniard Alejandro Amenabar (who directed Spanish thriller 'Open Your Eyes' recently remade as Vanilla Sky) and produced by the now ex Mr and Mrs Cruise, The Others is a welcome return to the art of suspense, as opposed to the often very poor modern schlock horror bloodfests that seem to appear in our movie theatres on a weekly basis. Set in the English channel island of Jersey shortly after its occupation by German forces during World war II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a single mother, apparently widowed, struggling to bring up her children in an old mansion, lacking in basic amenities such as electricity, which was cut off during the war. This is complicated further by the fact that her children suffer from a rare but potentially life-threatening allergy to sunlight and her daughter's claims that the house is haunted. In need of new servants, three mysteriously appear out of the fog BUT did they respond to Grace's advertisement or does their arrival signal a more sinister turn of events?
Director, Alejandro Amenabar skilfully takes us on a tour of Grace's impossibly large and foreboding house, permanently in semi-darkness and surrounded by fog. From a slow start and be warned it is a slow start, he slowly but steadily cranks up the tension and suspense, posing more questions than he gives answers, slowly building a grip around your heart and squeezing gently. Nicole Kidman shines as the stern mother losing her mind in what is likely to be an Oscar nominated performance (although in my opinion she is better in Moulin Rouge) and she is ably supported by Eric Sykes as the gardener Mr Tuttle, the two children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), Christopher Eccleston and in particular, the excellent Fionnula Flannagan as the housekeeper. And although you might just guess the ending before all is revealed, this is still an excellent old fashioned ghost story that (in my opinion) surpasses the likes of 'What lies Beneath' and unless you strongly dislike slow paced films I would highly recommend this.",1013558400,11,2384,4.9181141439205955
1314144,5,B00003CYLJ,"If I had to summarize what I thought of the film with only two words, I'd choose 'incredible' and 'haunting'.  The crafting of this psychological thriller is excellent--the story, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the scoring, the sound engineering, and yes, even the timing.  Some people find it slow, because they totally miss the point.  The slowness and quietness is what builds up the oppressive atmosphere, and it is what makes it an edge-of-the-seat experience.
I had liked Sixth Sense very much, and had thought it very clever. But the storytelling and direction in The Others was so much more impressive and intelligent I think--it didn't have to resort to a flashback of scenes to explain the point of the story (a storytelling cop-out I felt, in Sixth Sense).  Everything from the beginning of the film flowed naturally to the climax, and then the satisfying denouement.

Nicole Kidman was at her finest. I recommend this to be a movie that you own - not rent or borrow - you will want to see it again, then you'll want to invite friends over to watch it with you so you can enjoy their reaction.

Their lives go into upheaval however when the youngest child complains that he is being harrassed by another boy whom only he can see.  The story then unfolds with the famly attempting to come to term with  these ""visitors"" until a climactic moment when the mother and her children are forced to come to terms with their reality.  The ending is unforseeable and heartbreaking but is a refreshing break from the typical Hollywood ending of All's well that end's well.

It is not about ghosts waiting behind closed doors ready to terrorize the characters, as well as the audience. Because of the way it was presented in those previews, it is a little disappointing emotionally as well as slow paced. However, its new perspective, which you must wait for until the very end of the film, more than makes up for this. On many subjects we assume so much and know so little. Once in a while, in the written word, or on the screen, we are faced with a new perspective that probes the deepest part of our soul. The Others is such a motion picture, the type that you cannot leave behind in the theater. While the cast's performance is excellent, it is the storyline that carries the movie.

I went to see this at the theater with my sister, knowing nothing about it except for having seen the trailer.  At one point in the movie, I screamed out loud.  I have never ever in life done that before at a movie.  And suprisingly... 85% of the other people in the theater did as well, including my sister, whose fingernails I had to then forcibly remove from my wrist/skin.  At another point, every hackle, every hair on the back of my neck and forearms, every fiber of my being came to attention and I was riveted to the screen.
That, my friends, is what I deem excellence in a movie.
Nicole Kidman delivers an oscar worthy performance.  Very Grace Kelly in her inherent classy, graceful demeanor.  The performance of a lifetime - I've never seen her better.
The children - oh the children were excellent.  They portrayed anger, fear, sullenness, intelligence...  They WERE those children.
The house played an important part as well, dark shadows... ambience... mystery...
This movie doesn't rely on blood, gore, facemasks, knives, profanity, or sex.  It speaks to you on a more cerebral level in a very intelligent manner and I predict you will get SO swept away that you will scream as well.  ;-)

She fully deserves all the best actress awards that come her way (I hope that the Academy is intelligent enough to acknowledge her stunning interpretation.). In appearance, she reminded me of a young Grace Kelly. The children are wonderful too.  They are perfectly natural.
 There are no cheap thrills in this film; no gimmicks; and, most important, no ""yuck factor"" (I refer to such ""special effects"" as the vomit in the ""Sixth Sense.""). The film is totally cerebral, and the terror stems from the possibilities that dwell in the unseen and unknown depths of the imagination.

Now, for a few words on the subject...

Rating: *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Director: Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar
""The Others"" sets its opening tone rather well, as we see a series of dimly lit lithographs from some forgotten Victorian's children's book. Many of these relate to the story to follow, and form an odd mix of the nostalgic & the disturbing.  After this leisurely but unnerving start, complete with a harpsichord playing softly insinuating notes in the background of the soundtrack, we see a mansion shrouded in fog and see the caption for ""[Isle of] Jersey, 1945.""
Nicole Kidman, as Grace, soon appears on the screen: she's a lovely,but somewhat birdlike creature: pale alabaster face, wide eyes, many nervous mannerisms.  She soon admits three of the other main characters who arrive at the front door, a trio of mysterious servants-for-hire, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan), Mr. Tuttle, and the mute Lydia.  They have come calling about the positions advertised.  Grace informs them that the other servants left suddenly,""for no reason.""  She then takes the new servants on an odd tour of the lower rooms of the mansion--as she locks each door in sequence after leaving every room.  Now, with some reserve, Grace informs them that she would like for them to meet her children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband, Charles, left to fight in the Second World War, and has yet to return to them. The children, Grace informs Mrs. Mills, suffer from a rare skin ailment that could make exposure to sunlight potentially fatal, so an elaborate ritual of drawing all curtains must take place.  At last, we meet the two children, who seem rather demure and cowed by their mother's domineering nature.
As the movie progresses, we learn that Grace has a deep,abiding Catholic faith that causes her to dislike ""fancies"" of her children--especially talk of seemingly imaginary friends. Anne insists that a young boy, named Victor, lives in the house along with his family, that he pulls the window curtains aside in her and Nicholas's room in the dead of night.  Such talk infuriates Grace: she finds such notions bordering on blasphemy, the idea that the dead should walk before the Day of Judgment.  The claustrophobia of her rigid reactions engulfs the mood of the increasingly tense family.
But, then more odd events occur: whispering voices,a genuinely startling sequence with a piano playing a sad tune to itself in the darkened conservatory, doors opening and slamming for no apparent reason.  In a disused room, Grace finds a hidden album, bound in black with gold clasps sealing it.  What a peculiar Victorian artifact! As Mrs. Mills explains, the custom 50 years past was to compile books of photographs of the newly dead, as a momento mori.  These belonged to a family that had lived there during the 1890's.  With a repulsed reaction, Grace instructs her to destroy it.
Before long, Grace finds herself consulting with young Anne as to who the ""intruders"" are, and the nervous girl sketches Victor, his mother, his father, and a rather sinister eyeless ""old woman,"" who has manifested herself to the young
girl some 14 times.
Grace decides to strike out to ""the village"" nearby to consult with the local parish priest, but a cloying fog seals her off in the forest nearby.  A figure approaches in the gloom, and, as it approaches, we find it revealed to be...
I won't spoil the final surprises (and they are myriad) that the remaining plot of this movie brings.  I refuse to be so boorish, as I hope that many of you reading my words will consider spending an afternoon or an evening visiting that isolated mansion that always seems to have a pall of fog about it, where doors slam of their own accord, and shrill cries echo in the night.  Although one may fairly invoke ""The Turn of the Screw"" when discussing the film, I found myself more reminded of Robert Aickman for some reason, perhaps the spare elegance of the film appeared to invoke his prose, but also of a certain celebrated tale by a famous American horror writer & cynic of the 19th century.  I fear I will allow a spectral cat out of its bag should I say more at this moment.
For this film possesses a marvelous ""twist ending,"" and, while, in the final analysis, it presents a type of shaggy-dog story, I think you'll enjoy a thrilling ride along the way.",1010707200,9,4467,4.838582677165355

  It was nice to see Nicole Kidman to play a different type of character for once and she was exceptional in her part. The children were amazing and the servents were just creepy. The set was interesting and made the viewer wonder why anyone would choose to live there. But, it added to the surrel feel of the film.
  This movie had several twists and turns and an ending I never guessed.

1314382,5,B00003CYLJ,"The moment I walked into the theatre to see Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"" I knew I was in for a treat.  The theatre was a horrible mess as popcorn, candy and half dried sticky soft drink littered the floor.  My overactive imagination envisioned a film so frightening that the cinema patrons scared out of their wits sent the snacks flying all over the theatre as they jumped and screamed in terror.  Then the lighting and sound system began to have complications.  The film refused to roll and we sat there in darkness for a minute or two.  Then suddenly the sound system gave a thunderous boom, which scared the heck out of everyone, and we all nearly jumped out of our seats.  O.K a haunted theatre, all right the mood was set, let the frightening begin, roll film.
The film takes place in 1945 after the finale of WWII.  Nicole Kidman's character Grace lives in a big spooky mansion on a remote and dreary island, no phones, no lights, no motorcars, not a single luxury.
The film opens as Grace wakes up screaming, which I thought was old hat as this has been done before, but the films ending makes perfect sense of this horrifying moment.  This haunted house tale is exceptionally well done and it has everything; spooky housekeepers, thick fog, dark rooms, a cemetery, slamming doors, ghostly whispers, chilling shadows, things that go bump in the night and eerie children.
The children played by Alakina Mann (Ann) and James Bentley (Nicolas) are excellent.  They try to tell they're mum that there are some strange goings on in the house, but mum will have none of it and thinks the children have over active imaginations or are just plain lying.  Also, the pasty faced children suffer from a rare disease in which they are allergic to light, thus they have to remain in darkened candlelit rooms.  Grace's daughter Ann gives one of the movies most memorable (and imitatable) lines.  Grace enters a room to investigate some strange happenings she unknowingly lets sunlight into the children's room.  Like a vampire the daughter flings her arms to cover her face and exclaims in that wonderful English accent ""Mummy please, you're letting in the light!"" the child then slinks into the dark shadows like a creature of the night. Oooooh it's so spooky.
If you are into blood, gore, monsters, and the ilk this film is not for you.  The Others is all atmosphere, sounds, darkness, light and excellent acting, a true psychological thriller.  There are some slow moments in this film but the finale makes up for it.  This is definitely an ""in retrospect"" film in that your mind will work overtime after the films finale trying to figure out what you've just witnessed as you begin to understand all that has just happened on the screen.  Your perception of what you think was happening during the film will be shattered at the film's end.
And that's about I can tell you about the film because I don't want to give anything away.  But I jumped; I gasped and shut my eyes once or twice.  The film is filled with chilling twist and turns and the films ending is just astoundingly spectacular.
I never cared for Nicole Kidman; I've always viewed her as Tom Cruise's beautiful but talentless wife (now ex-wife).  I now have a newfound respect for Kidman, I saw Moulin Rouge and she was excellent and in The Others she's even better, she really acts her butt off in this film, we're talking Oscar caliber acting.
You must see The Others, I took three friends to see it and they enjoyed it and even thanked me for taking them to see this wonderful fright film.

1314383,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is one of the best horror films I have ever seen, bar none. It harkens back to the creepy black and white ghost stories from years back, in particular, The Innocents, with Deborah Kerr. Nicole Kidman's character, as well as everyone elses, are so perfectly written that the movie draws you in very quickly. When we find out the children are sensitive to light and that Mommy (Nicole K) is overzealously religious and says the most bizzare things in regards to this, with a perfectly straight face, you are instanly hooked with no chance of getting away. It was a relief to actually watch a movie that is basically flawless all the way through. There have been so many  bad movies out there, no matter what the genre, that it was a luxury to sit back and actually have a movie evoke emotions. And that it is scary as hell makes it all the better. When is the last time a single scene in a movie made nearly everyone in the audience scream outloud? You'll have to think real hard. But The Others does this and mantains a gripping hold on you throughout.",1010016000,,1062,4.446153846153846

I had heard too many good things about it, but when I seen it I thought it was a disappointment. The ending is great, it really catches you off guard. I guess the ending is what made me leaving the theater ""satisfied"", but no more. The movie was said to be ""scary"", ""creepy"", ""edge of your seat entertainment"". When I left the theater all I felt was that numbness in my legs. Don't be fooled, ""The Others"" is good entertainment, but don't expect much else. The fact of all the OSCAR talk for Kidman's performance was stupid. She is okay in the movie, but nothing OSCAR worthy.
If you just want to see a fairly decent movie on a snowy or rainy Sunday night, I would recommend it. But as for buying it on video or DVD, I would say no. However, if the DVD has enough special features, I MIGHT rent it. I hope my review was helpful.",1009843200,2,916,4.2701149425287355

This film was a real treat to me because although I enjoy a good gruesome horror from time to time I appreciate psychological horror and ghost stories much more. My tastes lean toward the Omen, the Changeling, Exorcist, the Shining etc...where the real power of the evil is hidden to a degree. The Others, without offering up a spoiler, starts out necessarily slow and builds up to what I consider one of the best ghost stories to hit theaters in many many years. Just enough twists and turns. There was potential for this to be a bomb (just add Keanu Reeves to the cast...don't worry he's not in this one), but there was so much care and atmosphere added to the project (location, cast, crew,etc...) that suspension of disbelief was imminent for the viewer. You couldn't help but feel you were there in the house with the family seeing and feeling everything they saw and felt. Quite unnerving at times and very isolated.

I won't waffle on about the plot as you will have read about this on previous reviews.  However, this is a delightful, nicely-paced (slow but just right for the film) classical ghost story.  No mindless gore, just a spooky thriller.  It shouldn't be compared to The Sixth Sense just because both are ghost stories. There is no resemblence apart from both films being cleverly-written, well acted, thought-provoking and both having outstanding endings.

My friends told me it was a horror film but that doesn't even come close to the suspense it contains.  Not knowing what the film was about was great because I had no preconceived notions in my head and I couldn't compare it beforehand with other films.  The film gives a vague notion of time only mentioning ""the war"" and not even which one.  It could be WW1 or WW2.  The plight of the children is very real. Their fear of sunlight is fed back to the audience making it more terrifying and suddenly you find yourself concerned for their welfare.  That concern and the odd events that begin to occur heighten the imagination and the senses go wild.  The music pounds just a little faster that your heartbeat and the lighting in the film plays little tricks on the mind (was that a person running across the screen?).  Try to avoid using preconceived notions when sitting down to watch the film.  Gather round with friends or a loved one, a little popcorn and try to talk as little as possible.

1314389,4,B00003CYLJ,"While most of the movie-goers will focus on the inevitable irony of Nicole Kidman starring in a movie produced by her erstwhile husband Tom Cruise, THE OTHERS directed by Alejandro Amenabar of Open Your Eyes fame scores beautifully with its elegantly controlled suspense and horror. Just when you thought Ms. Kidman's career has taken a backseat after the divorce, she slams critics with an intensifying performance as Grace, the mother of two children, Annie and Nick (James Bentley) subjected to a mysterious disease that forbids them to come under strong light. With the misty landscape of a British coast and a cavernous mansion, where Grace practises locking one door before entering the next to prevent sunlight from filtering in - the mystery sets in - even more so after a housekeeper Mrs. Mills with her motley gang steps in.
THE OTHERS may lack the intrigue in the Sixth sense as a paramormal scarefest but it boasts an unexpected twist that justifies the slow pacing. The performance of Ms. Kidman as a forlorn wife waiting for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston) is sterlingly vulnerable and emotive. THE OTHERS after a slew of right-in-your-face horror gore offered by this summer's Jeepers Creepers and 13th ghost is almost acutely refreshing. With its seasoned acting and Amenabar's prudent directing, it more than compensates for the gloomy mood enshrouding the movie that tests the patience of the audience. However, when the ending is revealed, the melancholic tragedy of Grace comes out hauntingly poignant and judiciously rewards the audience for the wait.",1007164800,10,1590,5.166666666666667
1314476,5,B00003CYLJ,"I was blown away by ""The Others""!  It's one of the best made thrillers I've seen in awhile, right up there with ""The Sixth Sense""!  The suspense in this film is almost unbearable at times, and the thrills and surprises just keep coming out you.  ""The Others"" is a first-class thriller; it manages to be terrifying without a lot of blood and gore, which is what many horror movies now resort as a result of a poorly written script.
Nicole Kidman was dazzling and extremely convincing in one of her best performances yet.  I defintely think that she is one of the best actresses out there! I was very impressed with how she went from being a courtesan in ""Moulin Rouge"" to a religious mother in ""The Others"". She is truly a very talented actress; one of the best actresses out there in my opinion!

1314478,4,B00003CYLJ,"After reading a few other reviews of this film, it seems that too many people are comparing it with Sixth Sense. Sure, the ending is very similar, but is conducted in an entirely different way and the storyline up until this point is completely different. The setting and characters could hardly be accused as similar, and the idea behind it, I think, is actually quite original.
Once the film had ended, my thoughts did not immediately turn to Sixth Sense but made me think over the events and actually sent a shiver down my spine.
I thought that the setting was very atmosphetic and was scary without resorting to mass-killing sprees and psychotics.
I enjoyed the film because it kept me guessing until the end, and even after the conclusion had been brought to light I still had it rattling around in my head.
The key to enjoying this film however, is NOT going into the theatre with thoughts of other films in your head... you sit down and think about the film itself, not the ones it is slightly similar to!!!!",1006732800,2,1015,4.582417582417582

Over-shadowed by Harry Potter and slated by many in the papers, I thought this an excellent, atmospheric film without the needless blood-shed and violence found too often in such film. It is mainly built on suspense and aided by superb acting by Nicole Kidman who will surely get an award for her role as the secluded, helpless mother in a weird house with only the motley crew of servants (including Eric Sykes). There are parts in the film where the heart stops and, by the end, leaves you thinking which is a sure sign you've seen a good'en. It can be enjoyed by all (not sure why it is a 12).",1006041600,5,620,4.353448275862069
1314480,3,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is, in essence, a typical ghost story.  Swirling mist, eerie green light and mysterious piano playing all contribute to creating an effective ambience in which the characters experience strange going-ons.
Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, lives in a large isolated house on the island of Jersey in 1945.  Her two children suffer from an allergy to light, doors are kept locked and curtains drawn in Grace's attempt to protect Anne and Nicholas from the sun's rays. (As a result much of the film is in dim light and the suspense is built up with the fumbling of keys trying to get in and out of rooms.)  When three `visitors' turn up at the house Grace receives them in and is grateful that they can now take the place of the servants who ""mysteriously disappeared a few days ago"".  Unfortunately not all her problems are solved when she discovers there are `intruders' in the house.
The Others is not a bad film, on the contrary, the acting is faultless, the atmosphere suitably chilling and certain touches in particular are very effective; such as Grace's frantic search for the intruders to the backdrop of her daughter's bible reading, and the beautiful image of Grace as she stands against the wrought iron gates.  The story line does, however, lack the structure and definition which have made similar films (namely The Sixth Sense) so memorable.  The film seems to waver somewhere in the middle and as it nears the end the audience are almost craving a final momentous twist.  When delivered, though, it fails to give the `punch' that is expected and leaves the viewer less than satisfied.",1005868800,4,1607,4.800724637681159
1314481,4,B00003CYLJ,"I'm not going to repeat the praise of other 4/5 star reviews, although everything they say definitely stands. I'd just like to say that 'The Others' proves that the genre of the 'haunted house movie' can be replicated with real panache in the 21st century. The slow, suspenseful build up, sometime shocks, twists and turns follow the conventions of the genre very stylishly. Anyone who felt this film 'plodding' probably doesn't appreciate the slow build up of suspense required to be effectve with this kind of story. Go and see it, and the best advice I can give, is don't bother trying to guess the twists in the tale, just allow yourself to sit back and be entertained. Another piece of advice is: don't read any of the negative reviews here before you see the movie, because from what i've read on these pages, many of those who didn't enjoy it seem determined to selfishly reveal vital plot points to people without considering that this totally ruins a movie for most of us.",1005696000,4,981,4.676300578034682

1314483,4,B00003CYLJ,"'the Others' is the best Hollywood movie of the year, a genuinely spooky ghost story; that rare thing in this age of high concepts, preview audiences, market research and CGI effects, a film that is all about plot, that uses plot to reveal (and conceal) character, that uses the consoling properties of plot (explanation, resolution, reconciliation) to create further ambiguities and mysteries.
in its story of a woman who may or may not be seeing ghosts; of seemingly malevolent servants; of innocent children in danger of corruption; the film has been compared to Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw', the scariest book ever written.  it shares with that tale a slow-burning, nerve-fraying suspense narrative; a vividly atmospheric locale (in this case a remote manor on a remote English island further removed from Britain having been occupied by the Germans) and a mood of barely suppressed panic.  Working in a popular medium under a studio system, director Amenebar cannot follow James into completely terrifying irresolution, but there are sequences where the tension goes beyond the confines of narrative into the truly uncanny, such as the scene where Kidman leaves the house at the pitch of the action, walks down a cold and forlorn wooded lane, the first time we have been out of the estate's confines, and is soon lost in fog.
Amenebar is a Spaniard and has taken a predominantly Protestant genre - the haunted house story - with its pseudo-rationalist basis in psychological or allegorical crises, and infused it with a very scary Catholic mythology, such as Hell and Limbo, the idea of being dead but unrested forever; the idea of photosensitive children forced to live like moles in endless night.  The film is full of brilliantly low-key nuances rarely spoken about in British cinema or culture - the one German invasion in British soil (with Kidman's possible collusion resonating throughout); the destruction of the family by the patriotic need to go to war; the trauma of a single mother in a culture that demeans them.
There is a strange disjunction between the very Victorian atmosphere, with its lack of modern technology, its outmoded clothes, its formal way of speech, its obsessions with ghosts and cemetaries, its gruesome photo albums of the dead (which, it was hoped, would keep alive the deceased spirit) and the nominal setting, 1945, which, though an age away, seems so much more familiar and modern to us.",1005523200,2,2437,5.0272277227722775
1314484,4,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is a good old, traditional, stripped-bare, horror film. It works with a simple storyline, adds a fantastic score, great cutting and filming and a fine actress, ignores the perils of big, complicatd special effects, and shocks, and scares.
Kidman is superb in her role as a war housewife who's husband has gone to war, leaving his two children (both allergic to light) behind. After suddenly their servants leave mysteriously, a new set of servants turn up, wanting to work there.
Strange things start to happen, and they are associated with the servants. You can see a twist coming, and it does, but there is another twist, an amazing and mindblowing twist which truly explains everything.
The film generally is more chilling than outright scary, but some simple but excellent cuts can make the steadiest person jump once or twice. It is genuinely new, and turns the horror film on its head, managing to provoke thought and scare at once.",1005436800,,949,4.900621118012422

Pivotal plot points are delivered with granite-slab subtlety, removing any real sense of mystery. Other events like the heroine's husband's brief appearance are nonsense, even within the film's own odd reality, or pure McGuffin like the ""things buried under the leaves"".  The plot is slight to the point of non-existence and anyone who has read any review that mentions ""the twist"" will spend half the time trying to predict it.

1314578,5,B00003CYLJ,"Have you ever been offered the stale advice that one's view of the world depends on where that one is standing? Well, quite right, and THE OTHERS is an effective illustration of that truth.
Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, is the mistress of a gloomy old pile of a mansion on the British island of Jersey very soon after the end of World War II. Her husband, of His Majesty's Army, was, or maybe wasn't, killed during the conflict. Grace's children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), ostensibly have a fatal hypersensitivity to sunlight, which means that heavy drapes must always be drawn over the windows of the rooms they're occupying. To make matters worse, the electricity isn't working - the effects of the war and German occupation, you know - so lots of candle wax gets burned.
The movie opens as three former servants of the house, employed there before Grace's ownership, gain re-employment. They're led by the kind and imperturbable Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). The three are witness to the family's increasing awareness of mysterious household ""intruders"", which open curtains, play the piano, and rumble about in upstairs rooms. Ghosts, perhaps? They remain unseen to Grace and Nicholas, the epitome of a frightened young boy, but are regularly observed by the sassy older sibling, Anne. And there's more than just a little mother-daughter friction, not helped by the fact that Anne is not shy about telling the help that Mom recently went crazy.
The trepidation that builds in this very atmospheric film is not due to any overt horrors. There are no skeletons or mutilated bodies falling out of closets. No ghastly spirits go ""boo"" from around dim corners, and no razor-sharp knives flash from behind curtains to carve up unsuspecting flesh in the middle of the night. Rather, the suspense builds slowly in the flickering candlelight, in a house surrounded by an interminable mist, and in the mind of an increasingly agitated Grace. Both she and the audience know something is amiss, but what could it be? And what's with those old pictures of posed dead people lying about?
Kidman is superb as the edgy Grace, and Mann, a new face to this moviegoer, is great fun as the feisty Anne. Despite that, THE OTHERS is one of those movies about which I felt ambiguous up until the end, at which time I suddenly became a big fan and said ""Wow!"" I would pay to see it a second time just to revel again in the delight of watching the perspective suddenly flip. This is clever scriptwriting.",1002672000,9,2511,4.82830626450116

there's been no word since; the British government has
advised her to assume he's been killed in action. She
lives with her two photosensitive children (Alakina
Mann and James Bentley, both in their screen debuts)
in a mansion where the servants just up and left the
week before. One day, three new servant-types, led by
the indomitable Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan of
_Waking Ned Devine_ fame), show up and, after a bit of
interrogation, see to the domestic duties. Hot on
their heels start a number of ghostly appearances,
whispering, all that sort of thing.
Everything that is brilliant about The Others has to
do with cinematography. Composition of scene. Perfect
scene after perfect scene after perfect scene.
Amenabar has created a visually stunning piece of work
that just happens to have a workable plot and some
fine characters, thus the Tarkovsky ref
(cinematographically, there were more than a few times
during this movie I thought about the wondrous
landscapes in Andrei Rublev).
No one takes that much time and pays that much
attention to detail anymore, save arguably M. Night
Shyamalan. Wonderful, excellent, fantastic.
Predicatable, too, but who cares? The first film I've
seen this year that rivals Memento for the top spot on
the year's-best list. (...)",1001894400,,1795,4.927392739273928
1314659,4,B00003CYLJ,"Nicole Kidman is not my favorite actress. I was unsure if I would like this movie because she was the main character. However, I ended up liking it quite a bit. In my opinion there was some bad acting on her part, but the rest of the actors were very very good. I was impressed at the children in the movie - they were very convincing actors. The old woman also gave a superb performance.
I loved the direction of this movie. Its scenes and timing were haunting and eerie. The feeling of the living among the dead was absolutely creepy.
As for scariness, I think the previews built this movie up to be scarier than it really was. I hate when movies build up scary moments only to have them flop. For instance, there was a part with scary music where Kidman thinks she sees a creepy looking man standing in the room looking at her, but then it is revealed that it is only a painting on the wall.
This movie reminded me of the movie ""The Haunting"", which I liked, and the book ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, which I also liked. The mix of the living and dead characters reminded me of the theme of the book ""Juan Paramo"".
In the beginning I thought parts of the movie were cheesy. However, then it got very good and I was watching carefully for all the exciting plot twists. Several parts made me literally jump in my seat and scream out loud. Although I wish there would have been more of these parts, the parts that were there were very well done.
I would recommend this movie, especially if you are in the mood to be creeped out. It would make a great video to rent at a party, but you should also see it at the theatre because of the great special effects. The music, written by the director, is superb. The movie is definitely worth the admission fee, so don't hesitate to go see it!",1001808000,4,1795,4.251461988304094

The Cinematography was beautiful, how even the house would change with the scenes appearing, warm home, deserted house,  friendly one moment, menacing the next. Nicole Kidman was excellent in showing the two sides of every parent, the one that would give their lives for their children and the one that gets worn down by the immense strain of caring for them day after day.

I saw this opening night, not knowing or having seen anything about the movie, going solely for Nicole Kidman and the positive buzz over it. I was not at all disappointed. From beginning to end, this movie will thrill you. It is chilling because of the masterful cinematography and expert acting, not just of Nicole Kidman, but of the cast of Brits, as well, especially the two remarkable children. The only thing I regret is that seeing the movie a second time will not likely have the effect it had on me on that first experience.

1314663,2,B00003CYLJ,"Well. I didn't know anything about this movie when it was released, and now I wish that I had done before going to see it because otherwise I probably wouldn't have done. I feel that I am probably in the minority who liked ""The Sixth Sense"" but did not think it was sensational. This movie is basically the same, although nowhere near as intelligent or surprising. Shock, horror, I don't even have to say what happens at the end of the movie now that I have mentioned ""The Sixth Sense"" as you will probably be able to guess.
To be fair, it was not a bad idea for a plot. It had the potential to be intelligent and thrilling and perhaps even in a league far different from 6th Sense. However, it chooses not to be. Yet, this is not it's main failing. The main failing, I'm afraid, lies in the casting of Nicole Kidman. She is not the part at all, and barely even tries to act it. I'm sorry, but affecting a British accent and talking in a whisper for two and a half hours with occasional facial gestures (and I stress the word occasional) does not constitute acting. At least, not in my book. The gardeners were suspect from the beginning acting like you would expect a small child to act on Halloween while telling a ghost story. If you could not figure out what was going on with them from a fairly early stage then maybe you might be better suited to the latest Meg Ryan movie. Or maybe not. The only good thing about this movie was Christopher Eccleston, for the whole 15 MINUTES he's on screen. Even that makes no sense and seems to be entirely unrelated to the actual 'plot'. I don't know.
To conclude, this movie is entertaining, but to quote Steve Martin, ""I'm just here to make a movie, not a film..."" That pretty sums up ""The Others"". It is entertaining, but so not go see it under the misapprehension that you are going to see an intelligent or even scary movie. Heck, ""Scary Movie"" was more frightening.

It was a choice between American Pie 2 and The Others - and I'd rather have a scare than a laugh anyday! Nicole Kidman is superb in the film, she really takes on the role and deserves all the plaudits. The film is only set in one location - this spooky house - and there are not many characters in the film either, but this along with the great performances of the actors is what makes the film so intense and keeps you glued to the screen... so glued that you will jump up from your seat in certain scenes. The film runs through very well without getting boring, and the ending makes it even better. I won't say no more apart from watch it.. it's a must!",1001376000,3,743,4.027027027027027

In an old, dark house on an isolated fog-shrouded island, a young mother who is, well, shall we say, a bit too tightly wrapped awaits the return of her husband from World War II. Like HIll House in the original THE HAUNTING, things are just a bit off plumb from reality. The environment teeters on the edge of becoming surreal, but doesn't quite tip over although you feel that, at any moment, it just might. Mysterious servants appear. Things move with the patience and inevitabilty of a dark glacier towards the solution to the puzzle of this strange place. Excellent performances all around. Easily in the same class with the original TH and with THE INNOCENTS, the black-and-white -- and best -- version of Henry James's TURN OF THE SCREW.",1001289600,4,855,4.8231292517006805
1314751,5,B00003CYLJ,"Although some people may find this a Sixth Sense rip-off, which the protagonist is often involved in the ironic plot twist at the end, I find this movie, similar in this light, smarter and better made than its predecessor. However, both movies are great and have their own unique qualities and strengths. You simply can't judge these two movies by comparing them too closely.
In Sixth Sense, the concept of ghosts manifesting so realistically is terrifying, as though we couldn't be safe in our own homes because, down that dark hall, could be a girl sitting, with her guts spilled out on the floor, saying ""play with me,"" as she tosses her red ball restlessly against the wall--unaware that she's dead! Or, even scarier, imagine walking down the hall and, out from one of the distant rooms on the side, comes a ball that bounces against the wall and slowly rolls back into the room. Or, here's another one: imagine walking in your room and turning on the light, suddenly taken by a man with jaundice eyes shaking you by your upper arms, yelling, ""What are you doing in my house?!"" Or, imagine somebody bleeding with a bullet hole through the head, yelling something incomprehensible like, ""They came in at night. They killed my entire family!"" The possibilities are endless, when you consider ghosts can be that imposing and real. (Sometimes we find comfort in the idea that ghosts supposed to be obscure images or a presence you may feel in the corner of your eye but will disappear when you look--to save your sanity.) Also, the idea that someone is in your safe home, raving about something you have no idea what they're talking about is also downright terrifying--and oh yeah, as you observe their terrible wounds, you think how they should be dead! All in all, this movie could brilliantly frighten people. On the other hand, Sixth Sense is filled with dragging scenes as the story makers lay out the necessary information for the ironic plot twist at the end.
The Others had a classic feel to it. I love the house that the director has chosen as the setting. The style is similar to The Haunting, without the weak plot. I like the classic ghost story feel, namely the illustrations in the beginning, the mansion, and the fantastic rebellion from using blood as the prime tactic in evoking fear. I also like this movie's subtle humor which departs from the classic ghost tale, for example, how they play on the rattling chains clich.
The Others also scares you on a different level. It's scary but makes you wonder at the same time. It made me nervous throughout the movie, and at times, made me jump in my seat. However, it's not a movie that will keep me up late at night with my teeth chattering and my nails half-chewed away. This movie's strength in its ability to scare as well as to make the audience wonder in amazement at the same time lies in its wit; it's very thought-provoking and creative (I know I thought, ""Oh, so that's how ghosts live. Interesting!"").
Unlike the Sixth Sense, The Others actually keeps the audience tense throughout the movie. At times, the way the story prepared the audience for the irony at the end, while at the same time, keeping you off your seat with the-curtains-are-missing scene, the-return-of-the-father scene, the-tramping-footsteps scene, or the-room-with-the-bed sheets-covering-over-the-furniture scene. These scenes and many more sustain the tension throughout the film while also stimulating the audience intellectually (especially after the movie, when the story completely unfolds and the audience has been given time to absorb everything). Another aspect of this movie that kept me increasingly tense toward the end is its several ironic plot twists, instead of just one (The Sixth Sense).
Finally, the ending of The Others is stylish and brilliant, when the family of ghosts stands like statues at the window as their images fade away into the perspective of the ""real,"" flesh-and-bone child of that time. This creepy image leaves a lasting impression; most people will ponder over this last and departing look at the unique perspective of the ghosts themselves. Ghost stories will never be the same. In a typical ghost story, the vague figure standing at the window, which the protagonist almost swears to have seen from afar, now has a life and a story behind it.",1001289600,2,4326,4.871099050203528

1314753,5,B00003CYLJ,"This movie knocked the wind out of me. I was GLUED to the screen
and could not look away and that's a feat in itself. It seemed to zip by and felt like only 30 minutes. In fact, I didn't want it to end. I am a big movie critic and 98% of the movies made in the past few years are trash, dumb, and a waste of time. It's wonderful to see that there still are a few chair-gripping, CEREBRAL (to the dense, ""cerebral"" means ""boring""), good scripts out there. Another good thing is that ACTING involves facial expressions, eye expressions and (heaven forbid) emotions instead of blood, gore, and cursing, flying around amid shallow car chases set to bombastic and robotic ""music"" that is used to overwhelm and distract the viewer from the lack of script and acting abilities.
""The Others"" is a fantastic find. Nicole Kidman is excellent in this. I never gave her much of a chance before, but now see that she is very talented. Julia Roberts couldn't have pulled this off. Nicole's expressions and eyes screamed volumes as she made me feel what the character felt without having to say a word. The children's performances were some of the best I have seen by kids. The other three main characters were perfect as well! They kept me guessing!
I find most movies completely predictable and the soundtracks to be overblown and distracting. That is not the case with this one. I loved the quiet moments that were used to build up the suspense and to allow the viewer's mind to race with ideas--something that has been sorely missing from films for years. The music ENHANCED the movie!! What a nice change that is! It was perfect and added mystery, eeriness and helped solidify the aura and tone of the film, instead of banging you over the head and being annoying and obnoxious.
""The Others"" has terrific acting, a wonderful story line, an enhancing soundtrack, is full of feelings, emotion and fear. We all fear the unknown.

Grace (Nicole Kidman) is raising her two children who have a rare disease which prevents them from coming close to any light whatsoever.  One day, several strangers show up at her door claiming to be servants.  Grace accepts them into her home.  She lays the rules down for them.  No door must be opened before the previous one is closed.
Soon, weird and eerie occurrences begin happening in Grace's home.  At first, she's unwiling to believe that any supernatural being could be dwelling in her home because of her religious beliefs.  But it doesn't take her long to figure out that something isn't quite right.
The Others is a wonderful film.  The scenery and background is amazing. Nicole Kidman, who I usually don't like at all, is extradoinary in this role.
This movie is packed with many suspense and chilling moments.  The ending is unbeliveable, but I won't spoil it here.  I'm sure it won't dissapoint you.

I felt like I was watching a cheesy horror flick (like Scream). The movie had a very bad turn when the husband arrived. His arrival was utterly pointless and went on for a boring 30 mins.

Sure, that's a lot to ask from a movie, but from what I understood the critics reviewed it as being one of the scariest movies of the year. I was greatly dissapointed.
Nicole Kidman plays the mother of two small children who have a horrible problem; they're allergic to the sun. So, at all times she must keep the house as dark as she can to make sure she doesn't kill her young ones. But, with her husband gone off to war and her old servants' mysterious dissaperance, she is left all alone. Until, that is, she hires a new staff of servants. She suddenly discovers, though, that there is something quite odd about these servants, something she can't put her finger on. Now, her children are seeing ghosts in every corner of the darkened house and she is becoming more and more suspicious of the servants every day. What is she to do?
There are some great twists and turns in ""The Others"", not to mention the movie's great story, fabulous acting from everyone, and an ending that will knock you out of your socks. So if this movie is so fabulous, why am I giving it four instead of five stars? The answer is simple; it's not scary. Not once was I freaked out, or did I jump. It never gave me the creepy feeling that they were trying very hard to deliver. A sign of a good ghost movie is that they can creep you out without any amazing special effects or loud sound effects. It should make your flesh crawl. I'm afraid ""The Others"" just doesn't do that.
So, if your looking for a movie with a great story and some great acting, than by all means go see ""The Others"". But if your looking for something that's going to have you on the edge of your seat, go to the video store and pick up a copy of ""The Sixth Sense"".",999302400,,1863,4.235955056179775

The Other's is not unlike the original ""Haunting"" in tone so perhaps that is a clue that you might like this film.
Overall The Others is a good ghost story offering some fun jump scares and keeps you wondering what is hiding behind the next corner. On the downside it often drags and does not keep its secrets nearly as elegantly as the Sixth Sense. In one sequence Nicole Kidman has an interlude with a male visitor. The film tries but does not successfully make the encounter feel a sad and natural part of a normal story. What happens is too unnatural. It avoided showing things in a way it was obvious to me I was being manipulated to think something other than the truth. I was not hard to guess the rest after that.

1314955,5,B00003CYLJ,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. Nichole Kidman and the actress that plays ""Mrs. Mills"" should defeinitly get Oscar noms for this (best actress & best supporting actress). From the get-go this movie pulls you in and keeps your mind on edge the whole time. No weak scenes, dialog, acting, anything. You MUST see this flick. I've seen it twice now. I know everybody has (desrevedly) mentioned how great Nichole and the kids were, but the three ""helpers"" were also brilliant. This movie ranks right alongside ""The Changeling"" for GREAT horror / suspense. Make sure you're paying attention when you see this; it's a great ride.

1314956,4,B00003CYLJ,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Current horror films depend so much on effects that good story telling is sacraficed. To begin with, the setting and house evoke a creepy, calmness that stays throughout the film. The pale, yellowish lighting adds shadows which are both scary and beautiful. The images are almost like engravings. Kidman portrays a character that is not particularly sympathetic but is increasingly appealing as the movie plays out. The children are like figures from Charles Dickens in their innocence. The household staff often are witnesses to what appears to be a seriously dysfunctional family, however, even their smiles seem strangely weird. With a great twist at the end the viewer is given that rare treat by current standards-just a good old fashioned horror picture.",998956800,2,807,5.2153846153846155
1314957,5,B00003CYLJ,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! This is the best ghost movie since The Uninvited, made in 1944. It's taken almost 50 years to top it. Thank you Alejandro Amenabar for adding class, intelligence, and innovation to an otherwise lackluster movie summer. I have seen two great movies this year, both of which starred Nicole Kidman. She is as excellent in The Others as she was in Moulin Rouge. If this isn't Nicole's year to win an Oscar, I don't know when she will. The kids are also terrific and I liked how realistic their characters and relationship are portrayed. These are not your typical movie kids. I loved Nicholas! There has been a lot of comparisions made between the Others and the Sixth Sense. I can understand were they are coming from - I too thought of The Sixth Second while watching the Others - but any comparisons that can be made are merely superficial. The Others has everything the Sixth Sense lacked - a compelling story, well-drawn characters, good acting, and real scares instead of gore shocks - and is what the Sixth Sense wanted to be - an interesting, intellegent, atmospheric, complicated ghost story. The Others is far superior than the Sixth Sense. If you are looking for a thrill-a-minute, special effects-laden gorefest, this movie is not for you. However, if you understand that real terror comes not from what we see but what we don't see, not from the known but the unknown, and if your attention span is longer than a fruit fly's and you can appreciate a well-told, slowly unfolding story, then go see this movie!",998956800,10,1538,4.7

They have a rare condition and cannot be in the sunlight. The heavy curtains are drawn, and Nicole must lock all doors behind her so that the children will not go into the room with sunlight, by mistake. This is not a BOO, I scared you type movie, but, rather, a haunting, deeply personal film. The plot is very good and if the camera leaves you alone for a moment the musical score grabs you and you really don't have time to jump ahead and try and figure it out. You have to wait for the movie to unfold, it gives u nothing in advance.

(Neither hubby nor my brother-in-law like seeing scary movies with me after my freaking out on them in theaters. So I knew how bad I could be.) The amazing thing is that I figured out the big twist in this film within the first thirty minutes or so. Did this calm me down? Of course not! I was still scared! The plot line involves a woman waiting for her husband to return from World War II in its winding down aspect, circa 1945. She lives in a big house on the Channel Islands with her two children who must avoid daylight since they are allergic to it. Thus, the house is perpetually dark and gloomy, fitting the ghostly aspect of the story. Has this woman's house been invaded by ghosts or others and, if so, who are they? That is the crux of the thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat. Nicole Kidman is superb in the lead role. When the film is well written, she is showing again and again that she has what it takes as an actress.

1315066,4,B00003CYLJ,"Judging from the reviews I've read on here, folks either love this film or hate it. A few have even given it 1 or 2 stars because they didn't like the 'twist' at the end, and then go on to add descriptors like 'well made', 'startling', and the like. Go figure. Well, I come down on the 'loved it' end of the scale. A lot of folks are comparing it to 'The Sixth Sense'. I think much better comparisons are (for different reasons) the original (1963) 'The Haunting' (in my opinion, the best haunted house movie ever made) and 'Jacob's Ladder' (which is an absolutely classic updating of a classic Ambrose Bierce short story). But those comparisons are made repeatedly by the other reviewers on here. I think it comes down to: do you like psychological thrillers or 'in your face' slasher films? Both can be effective, but rely on completely different film making and story-telling conventions. This film is very much the former, hence the 'slow' pace (which I didn't find slow) and the emphasis on character development. Personally, the stuff that scares me the most are the unexplained bumps in the night, that strange feeling that something you can't see is in the room and looking at you, and the sense that the people around you aren't quite 'right'. This film gets that stuff perfect. Oh yes, the visuals and score are excellent and the acting is wonderful. Ms. Kidman, especially, gives a wonderful portrayal of a devoted and protective mother slowly coming to grips with the realization that she really doesn't know what's going on.",998697600,,1537,4.7388059701492535
1315067,4,B00003CYLJ,"UPDATE FEBRUARY 13, 2018: I no longer watch horror films and do not endorse this film, this is just an old review.

ORIGINAL AUG 25, 2001 REVIEW: ""The Others"", while following closely in the foot steps of films like ""The Six Sense"", and very heavily indebted to the 1960 ghost saga, ""The Innocents"" , or even ""A House on Haunted Hill"" or ""The Haunting"".  It is a much more old fashioned tale of the super natural than and would become a hallmark of great modern Gothic ghost stories.

This tale is not so much a horror movie as it is a gothic psychological thriller that will take you on many twist and turns before the end credits role.  Nicole Kidman is Nicole Kidman, she functions well in a movie like this, as a very religious mother(often telling them things such as ""If you're bad you'll go to limbo"" to keep them in line)  whom has to teach her children at home because of their unique condition.  The movie more relies less on special effects and more on atmosphere, a creative use of light and darkness(which is far more successful than the recent ""Lights Out"" was with it's usage of light and dark), and a sort of disconcerting feeling that we really do not know what is happening most of the time.  Back when I saw this in the theaters with my best friend at the time, we screamed our heads off at certain parts(I was 16yrs and she was 13yrs), we were provided more than a few good scares.  This film is more than cheap thrills, it has such a chilling atmosphere and a deep sense of dislocation, it just feels very unsafe almost, watching this film.

If you are a fan of classic Gothic thrillers and enjoy older ""horror"" movies, give ""The Others"" a shot, it is well-played and well-written, at this point, is a Classic of the genre, and though in the end it does almost feel like it could have been a bit more than it is, it is more than worth watching at least once if you are a fan of creepy and well-made films just to see what you missed the first go-around.

1315068,5,B00003CYLJ,"Simply put, this is a good old-fashioned ghost story. THE OTHERS is director Alejandro Amenabar's first english film. This film teaches a lesson on life, death, and religion. There are moments of genuine surprise for the characters who are willing to enter the Victorian house where ""the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living."" Nicole Kidman plays the controlling mother of a young boy and girl who must be sheltered at all times due to a rare skin condition.  Kidman portrays the nervous wreck role quite well, seeming sometimes heroic, and yet, sometimes openly hostile toward her troubled kids. She plays the part of a single mother with soul and conviction. Having to live with drawn curtains, the use of soft candlelight and shadowed corners presents a less sinister background in a seemingly creepy film. THE OTHERS is all about atmosphere and setting. The storyline slowly moves through a fog of uncertainty, passing though some thought-provoking, religious overtones. This spooky romp into the hauted house genre is loaded with thrills and chills, not to mention wonderful acting by Kidman, Christopher Eccleston, and Fionnula Flanagan.

1315069,5,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is an excellent ghost story set in an atmosphere of post WWII. The main characters are: a large country house, mother with two light-allergic children, mysterious housekeeper, mute girl, strange and allusive father, and old gardener. The suspense does build and does not fail to surprise. I had trouble concentrating on my popcorn. Hey, I am used to modern technology with all of the special effects, noise, blood, computerized actions, and semi-animated sequences. None of that for us. This was just a good old-fashioned scary story, right? Basically its a study in contrasts. Dark house vs non-electric lamps, gray tombstones covered with colorful autumn leaves, whispering vs screaming. At first I thought the management had forgotten to turn up the sound until I realized it was supposed to be that way. But we did NOTICE the screaming. Once I was so frightened I almost beat the characters to it. Tom Cruise produced it; but this film goes beyond being a vehicle for his ex-wife, Nicole Kidmon. It reminded me somewhat of ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muier, Portrait of Jenny, and the Haunting(Julie Harris one) and measures up to modern gems like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Ghost"" (without the comic relief). Kidman is stretched beyond her capacity in this finely directed film, but I think the director did the very best with what he had. The other performances shine, especially the stoic housekeeper, and the little boy. The girl's not bad either. I especially noticed a great moment when the housekeeper's mute daughter struggles to speak. Remember Dorothy McGuire in ""The Spiral Staircase""? Questions abound working there way to resolution. What is the mother really afraid of? What secrets do the staff keep hidden? Why doesn't everyone see the boy, Victor? What is that noise upstairs? Why does the father want to return to the front when the war(WWII) is over? Whose names are on those graves? What do we really believe about life hereafter? And really, who are the OTHERS? The OTHERS did not disappoint me. I found it well worth the price. It's a must-see in its cinematic excellence. You too will be frightened and amazed at the surprising ending which even I, though a buff of the genre for 45 years who figured out the ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" early on didn't get until the very last.

1315142,4,B00003CYLJ,"What an amazing actress Nicole Kidman is. I was a skeptic at first, thinking her celebrity was undeserved and only borrowed from her husband's name, but wow, film after film she has proved not only a marvelous actress but to be about as good a judge of projects worth being involved with as Mr. Cruise is, which, to me, is saying quite a bit. This film is no exception, her performance is riveting and propels the film the entire way. Her face alone is captivatingly expressive, emotional and intense. She is not alone either, the children and the servants are also played to perfection. They all contribute to the amazingly creepy atmosphere that Amenabar creates with his visuals and even with his self-written score. This film is about atmosphere and it is criticized for having little more. It is also about what is revealed in the end and for that being too little too late. To these protestations I want to respond. I must admit that I did feel a bit of a letdown in the end myself and despite a series of perfectly scary sequences leading up to it, the end makes the film feel on one level like scary build ups for the sake of scary build ups. The end can be (and has been) accused of being a twist for the sake of a twist or merely an exercise in unfairly withholding information from the audience. The movie can also be accused of being all atmosphere but with no substance. I disagree with all these charges but not because I don't see where they come from. This movie rests on its twist because unlike the Sixth Sense this movie makes you wait for the twist to feel like you know anything about what is going on. In the Sixth Sense you think you've understood the movie alright and that you've had plot development and resolution and that the sense of oddity to the whole thing can be chalked up just to tone of direction when suddenly you are shocked with a revelation into the real source of the strange mood and the true insight into what all of what you have seen and thought you understood was. This film does not temporarily appease you and so it leaves you dying to finally get the key to the film. With that level of anticipation the movie has trouble living up to the Sixth Sense's ambush surprise satisfaction rate. What is even worse for The Others is that it comes after The Sixth Sense and Fight Club and What Lies Beneath, and The Usual Suspects have prepared us for the mislead-the-audience brand of thriller that is not a mystery but a rather an audience participation demonstration in the relativities of perception. Since we've seen such a thing before, this film shocks us less and gives little meantime satisfaction so all we can concentrate on is the big shock coming. With those expectations, even if it is still surprising, it is in a way too predictable. So, I get the critique and think I see why it comes into play. I stand by the movie though because I think that this film is actually in the end, sharper than the Sixth Sense for its way of sticking to a very classic haunted house premise and working so successfully to put a new spin on such an old genre, its ability to stay extremely spooky in such a well known context, to invert our expectations right where we have the most expectations rather than creating a new realm of circumstances for the characters so that the audience is scared just from the confusion of trying to acclamate to its new world (as was the case in the Sixth Sense.) This movie puts us in a very predictable setting and yet scares us. I think that the film is really about watching it the second time. The Sixth Sense was disappointing the second time, once the joke was gotten going through the motions of watching it was unnecessary. The film was not ABOUT what it is like to live in a certain perception, primarily. Whereas I think this film is really about what it is like to be in that haunted house from the perspective of Kidman and her children and experiencing it knowing what they are really going through seems to me to be a fascinating twist worth watching reenacted repeatedly. It is like a visual work of art that way more than it is a narrative. The Sixth Sense was about the art of narrative more. This is about the portrait, the art of getting there, the every moment more than the grand finale. The better films sometimes are like that, they are not about big payoffs, and this film despite the obvious importance of the ending twists is not really one long set up to a twist. The twist is an element, a section of a larger work of beauty. It is rewatchable just for the visual picture of a way of being. Truman Show is much the same way, yet even better, for the care and beauty that goes into every moment, in which the end is only a glorious part of something sublime throughout. This is no Truman Show, some of the film does drag, and there are a handful of nice set ups that get wasted and a little bit of being creepy just for the sake of being creepy, but overall this is a movie that works even though it fails to be as climactic as a film usually needs to be. Occasionally at least, a film can be judged by criteria more similar to applied to static visual art and I think this one fairs proudly by such a standard.",998438400,,5210,4.394409937888199
1315143,5,B00003CYLJ,"Highly atmospheric and foreboding, ""The Others"" is unlike any ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" in 1963. Director Alejandro Amenabar brings to the screen a uniquely chilling tale that slowly makes its way under our skin until it's almost unbearable. I don't know which aspect of the film I liked better: the ominous setting where the eerie story takes place, or the magnificent performance from Nicole Kidman.
Kidman plays Grace, a mother of two children living in an expansive New England mansion surrounded by a ceaseless fog and dry vegetation. When three house servants show up at her door, they are bewildered by the manner in which Grace runs the household, closing each door before opening another, and closing any and all curtains to prevent all sunlight from invading the rooms.
We learn the sunlight is harmful to her young children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). From the beginning, Anne speaks of a past event that occurred between her and her mother, and of apparitions throughout the house. Grace dismisses her comments as rubbish, but becomes increasingly uneasy once she begins hearing voices in the upstairs rooms, and finds that doors in the house open and close by themselves without a key.
As the movie progresses, Amenabar creates a distinctly uneasy atmosphere in which even the audience knows better than to look at this house as little more than an expensive home. From a continuous fog to the whisperings of voices and things that go bump in the night, the scares come not from what we see, but what we don't see, which is even scarier than you may think. Amenabar proves that one needn't be subjected to a special effect in order to be frightened.
What helps the movie is the fact that it has a solid story to back its scares. What starts out as a slow-moving introduction to the characters and settings evolves into a first-class mystery on par with such mysteries as ""The Sixth Sense,"" though this film's clues are much more apparent. You may have found the pieces to the puzzle involving the three housekeepers, but that doesn't mean you've solved the film's resolution, which is an unexpected gem.
The real delight comes from the involving performance from Nicole Kidman, who evokes much of the fear throughout the film. There are times when she slowly makes her way into rooms to investigate suspicious noises, her eyes growing wider with psychological fear, and times when she becomes frantic, such as when she searches desperately for the curtains taken from the windows.
""The Others"" may very well be one of the best scare films we've ever seen. Amenabar gives his unique story a sense of fear that comes from the mind. In a decade of born-again slasher pics and gory bloodshed and mayhem, it's nice to be able to embrace something entirely different from the rest.",998352000,58,2842,4.87396694214876

With no blood or gore, the scares of ""The Others"" occur totally in the mind, a figment of the imagination, atmospheric music (by director Alejandro Amenabar), and one very creepy setting.
The film takes place on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands.  WWII has ended not long ago, and Grace (Nicole Kidman, in a pitch-perfect performance) and her two children Anne and Nicholas (the child actors are wonderful!) and living in a gigantic mansion that is in a perpetual state of darkness due to the children's unusual skin conditions (light will cause them to break into hives and, eventually, die).  Along come three servants, including Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who tells Grace that she used to work at the mansion.  But the fact that all is not right with these servants quickly becomes apparent.
To tell too much about this film would be a mistake.  The performances are terrific, and while some have called this film slow-moving, my interest was not lost for a second of the 2-hour running time.  For fans of Hitchcock, this movie is a relief and a revelation--its old-fashioned storytelling is unlike anything the other horror/thriller films have to offer today.  There are several twists, some of which are foreseeable in advance and others of which hit you just as they're being revealed.

The acting in this movie is great, especially the always excellent Nicole Kidman. This is her best thriller since ""Dead Calm"". The direction is great and very stylistic.

1315148,4,B00003CYLJ,"""The Others"" is full to the brim of wondrous and surprising things -- First and foremost, a script that opens like a Venus Flytrap -- exotic, seductive, deadly -- It dares us to look away, tantalizes, takes its time, invites us in, then closes like a vise on a simple, terrifying conceit:  Do the dead haunt the living, or do the living haunt the dead?  Amenabar's graceful, powerful writing and directing deserve our praise.  The cinematography of The Others is breathtaking --every shot seems composed from a nightmare, but one just out of the reach of true memory.  Fans of Christopher Eccleston (I am) will be delighted with his astonishing, almost wordless appearance.  Fionnula Flanagan (Mrs. Mills), and the two children give performances that can only be described as delicious.  NICOLE KIDMAN accomplishes something very rare here.  Not only does she serve the story, fitting the character like a glove, she conjures forth the bewitching image of GRACE KELLY in her prime.  This coincidence is not lost on Mr. Amenabar, whose camera captures Kidman in that rapturous, Hitchcockian way:  swirling down staircases, hovering at waist level, gliding like a predator, circling upward to the precise moment of profile.  Indeed, Ms. Kidman's embodiment of the late Grace Kelly is so startling, so uncanny, I was convinced there were two ghost stories unfolding simultaneously:  one in a haunted house; the other being a legendary actress reaching across decades to possess the soul of another.",998179200,,1495,5.136363636363637
1315149,5,B00003CYLJ,"Earlier this year Nicole Kidman added sparkle to a movie- Moulin Rouge- which revolutionized the musical and added some new life and vigor into a withering standard. Here, she does the same for the horror/suspense movie- pitch-perfect as a starchy but resolute stickler for faith, order, and discipline who is forced to understand the more complex nature of life and death and their unique relationship.  If you're going to see garrish ghosts or spells or coffins being raised from the earth, then skip this.  But if you're looking for a truly bone-chilling, terrifying, and immensely effective horror movie then The Others may well be your best chance in many years.  Amenabar shows a genuine knack for eeriness in this tale, directing a perfectly-paced movie that is short on gadgetry and stock setups and very generous when it comes to suspense and thrills.  This movie is as much cerebral as it is visual- alot of the scariest stuff is what happens in your head.  By the time you get to the end, you can actually feel Kidman's desperation in trying to protect her children from forces she cannot see and which she does not understand.  All the performances are accomplished, but it's Kidman's that is stellar. Some actresses have to flash alot of their flesh to get the audience's attention; a stare, and those icy green eyes, are all Kidman needs.  A brilliant performance; a masterpiece.",998092800,6,1393,4.902127659574468
1315150,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is one of the most brilliantly paced horror films I've ever seen.  It has a delightful eerieness the entire way through and the casting is amazing.  The character of Bertha really creates fear and distrust in your heart along with Mr. Tuttle and Lydia.  The children were magnificently chosen and Nicole Kidman hasn't been this good since Dead Calm, if not better.  Turns out she is a very talented actress.  The dialogue in this is also cunning and brilliant.  One of the most interesting and amusing lines to me was when Kidman is looking through the ""dead photos"" and says to Ms. Mills...""group portraits?"".  The ending is so very clever, very eerie and it really does surprise you.  Not to mention, all throughout the movie, there are little heart in your throat moments.  Everyone keeps comparing it, but this is so much better than Sixth Sense. I think the mood and tone are much more like Village of the Damned with those spooky children.  Definitely recommend checking it out for yourself.  Don't take the kids.",998092800,12,1030,4.762711864406779

An excellent supernatural suspense thriller, on a par with (and with elements of) the original ""Haunting"", the forgotten classic ""The Uninvited"" (read the books on these two, they are even better than the movies), and even ""The Sixth Sense"".  Shot with nice steady camera shots reminiscent of Hitchcock (no MTV editing here), backed with a hauntingly beautiful classical score written by the director himself.  Beautifully eerie lighting adds to the atmosphere and Kidman gives an incredibly moving, convincing performance as the wife of a missing English soldier protecting her children to the point of obsession that will bring you to tears at the end.  Clever, well crafted story with all the gothic elements used well: the dark brooding, desolate mansion; the woman not sure if she's slowly going mad or not; the two cherubic children who swear they see ""intruders"" wandering the rambling house; and the three mysterious servants who show up apparently out of thin air at just the right time.  Set on a desolate British isle at the end of WWII, shot through with hints of an unknown tragedy, this is a beautiful eerie film.

This is the first movie, I've EVER watched, that actually had me gripping my seat in suspense, not knowing what was going to happen next. There were times the pace was a bit slow, but it was only to give more shape to the plot, and I found all of those scenes interesting. Nicole Kidman gave a stunning performance as a religious, over protective mother of two young children who are resistant to any kind of light other than candle light. The 2 children in this movie are wonderful, and truly did very well. The remaining cast were also great. A movie with a completely great cast? Yep! The Others is a movie you can't give too much plot detail of, for it would ruin the entire thing. Therefore, this is going to be a pretty short review. But I must say, the ending is one to make you gasp or have to rethink the whole movie over. I wish I could talk more and more about The Others, but I would end up giving the whole thing away. It's a wonderful, thrilling movie with true scares that didn't require blood or a knife. I'm very much anticipating the DVD release.",998006400,,1163,4.266968325791855

1315254,4,B00003CYLJ,"Terrific! In the tradition of classic ghost story films such as The Haunting (the original 1963 version) and The Innocents, here director Allejandro Amenabar crafts a superb old-school-style additon to those worthy predecessors.
Eschewing ludicrous digital monsters and MTV-style editing, Amenabars film builds slowly and gradually, slyly creating a dense and rich atmosphere, a quality so utterly lacking in many so-called horror films of the last twenty years. (Silence of the Lambs and Jacobs Ladder being the exceptions). Here is a wonderfully old-fashioned, truly scary ghost story that brings to mind Henry James  The Taming of the Shrew as well as the aformentioned classic films.
Though the entire (small) cast is outstanding, Nicole Kidman gives, in my opinion, the finest performance of her career; her chilly demeanor has never been put to better use. She maintains a tight-fisted grip on a performance that could have, in the hands of a less talented actor, spilled over into irritatingly shrill histrionics, and perhaps even outright camp. Instead, her multi-layered and tense depiction of her character, Grace, allows us to experience the gradual horror along with her, and makes the journey into this weird, creepy universe credible. (If there is any justice in the world, she'll not only be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but recieve it.)
To describe the plot would give even the small shocks away; indeed, there are two scenes scary enough that you may actually forget to breathe. Prepare yourself for maximum chills: there is a scene (and this gives nothing away) in which Grace finds something; what she uncovers is unbelievably eerie. And then there is the scene in the fog....
Highly recommended for intelligent viewers who love a well told, classically presented, and seriously goose-bump inducing tale...",997747200,4,1840,5.301369863013699

I would label it more of a drama/thriller.
The movie is a little drawn out but tolerable and a nice movie to catch!!",997747200,2,435,4.253012048192771
1315256,5,B00003CYLJ,"'The Others' is one of those rare thriller/horror movies that goes for understating rather than overstating the suspense, and in my opinion, the end result is very effective.  An enjoyable movie with great old-fashioned conventions (which avoid playing as tired clichs), Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely astonishing performance as a repressed mother, Grace, on the end of her rope.  'The Others' is set immediately after World War II on the secluded (and recently occupied) Isle of Jersey.  The setting is very important in the movie; the monstrous house that Grace and her children occupy is their entire world, trapping them in a claustrophobic (despite the size) and dark place.
The premise of the movie is relatively simple: Grace's two children suffer from severe photosensitivity (ie anything beyond the dimmest light can be fatal), and her husband is missing from the war.  Because of this, no door can be open without the previous one first being closed.  Instead of trying to see what's lurking in the corner, Grace tries to hide it.  I won't say anything else, but the movie is full of fun twists and turns that are characteristic of Amenbar's movies.
Speaking of Alejandro Amenbar, the writer, director, *and* composer for the film's score, keep your eye on this guy.  He's only 29, and his previous two films ('Thesis' and 'Open Your Eyes', both in Spanish, which makes his English debut all that much more impressive) are very intelligent and memorable.  His directing in 'The Others' is not flashy, but it's perfect for the gloomy, creeping, gothic feel of the movie.  Any director who can direct a horror movie nowadays without succumbing to the temptations of cheap special effects or PSYCH! scare tactics gets my support, anyway!
So, go see 'The Others'.  There's a lot of familiar references in plot and style to other movies, but it's distinct, original, and well worth it in its own right.",997660800,15,1910,4.977987421383648

The director did an excellent job setting up the spooky atmosphere.  The plot begins when Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) wakes up screaming.  That was a good beginning, but then the movie mellowed out after that.  Grace answers the door to three people--a mute girl and an elderly couple--inquiring about servants' positions.  She hires them, introducing the two women to her children, who are allergic to the sun.  It is up to Bertha and Lydia to keep the curtains closed and the all the doors locked.  Why isn't totally clear until Grace hears a little boy sobbing, then someone running in the upstairs hallway.  The movie takes an eerie turn after the sobbing.  The children start talking about the day their mother ""went mad"", but they don't say exactly what happened to her.  We are left to assume that her mental decline occurred when her husband never returned from WWII.  Grace grows more hysterical, thinking that intruders are in her house.  The servants start conspiring with each other, to do what isn't clear until the end.  Whether Grace is going mad isn't clear until the end. This movie has all the twists and turns of The Sixth Sense, including the neat tie at the end.  But if you're looking for heart-pounding suspense, you'll leave the theater feeling disappointed.  If you're a fan of quiet horror and/or mystery, you'll enjoy it.",997574400,12,1478,4.71484375

1315345,4,B00003CYLJ,"'The Others' is set in 1945, toward the end of World War II, on the island in England known as Jersey. There is a massive mansion surrounded by fog. Living in the menacing abode are a mother, Grace, and her son and daughter. The husband/father is away fighting in the war, and is overdue for his return home. The regular servants have disappeared overnight, and in their wake have arrived three new servants, an old man and woman, and a young mute girl. They are creepy in their passive, haunting manner. Strange things soon begin to happen inside the mansion. Voices are heard, things start going ""bump"" in the night, and disturbing discoveries are made. To disclose much more would be to take away from the ""fun"" of watching this old-fashioned horror movie unfold, but suffice it to say, the plot takes many twists and turns, and the movie is never for a moment dull - though it *is* slow - be prepared for that.
  Nicole Kidman does a superb job as Grace. She is at the same time beautiful and malevolent, drawing sympathy as well as dis-like. She does a great job of helping to build the tension. The actors who portray the children are solid little performers. Their characters are allergic to light, so they are kept indoors, mostly in the shadows, and so this helps make the mood of the piece even more eerie. Fionnula Flanagan, a relatively unknown (here in the States) Irish actress makes good as Mrs. Mills, one of the new servants.
  The director also wrote the screenplay, and composed the music. He does a nice job bringing chills to the audience through the simple use of suspense and fear of the unknown. This is not a bloody horror flick, nor is it fast-paced. But it *is* good - very effective.",997488000,6,1711,4.563517915309446
1315346,2,B00003CYLJ,"The plot of this movie was very interesting (although it seemed I was watching The Sixth Sense again).  I was not impressed by Nicole Kidman's acting, although the other actors were convincing.
But, the thing that ruined my whole movie experience was a scene in which Nicole Kidman is talking to the new servants (towards the beginning).  As she is explaining about the house, the appearance of a microphone can be seen peeking from above.  I saw that (according to the audiences' snickerings, it was appearant that they did too), and I thought that maybe it was just one mistake.  However, that microphone made a cameo through that whole scene.  I hate to sound so critical; however, I feel that this caused me to think poorly upon the movie.",997488000,3,743,4.728682170542636
1315442,4,B00003CYLJ,"Admittedly, The Others is a gimmick movie from the beginning. Without giving too much of the movie away, the plot revolves around a family living in a ""haunted house."" Kidman plays the matriarch of the family, who denies the death of her husband to the War. Suffice it to say that the movie has enough twists to make heads turn. However, it's in these twists that make the payoff feel a bit too gimicky (i.e. more of a plot contrievance rather than a genuine ""a-ha!"" ending).
With that said, the movie is still engrossing and wonderfully moody. The pacing is just right, although some have said it to be a bit too slow. It isn't your typical horror movie. The movie doesn't concern itself with the gross out chills or even with ghosts or ghouls running amok. Instead, the movie is thoughtfully paced, well acted, and unrelentingly creepy. It's more of a suspense movie rather than of the horror genre.
It's better than your average horror movie...I liked it better than the 6th Sense. Worth at least a matinee.",997488000,,1010,4.648044692737431
1315443,5,B00003CYLJ,"The Others is one of the most atmospheric and chilling pictures to be released in a long time.

Before long, three servants show up at the doorstep to help with the upkeep of the house.  Who are these people and why did they just appear?
Amenabar, who wrote and directed the film, has his subject well in hand.  He is adept at revealing just enough to keep the viewer guessing without sacrificing any of the tension that is prevalent throughout the picture. His use of low lighting helps increase the scariness of the film without crossing the line into absurdity.

It has a chilling ending and leaves you hoping shes forgiven.  I thought the movie was tragic ghost story that has the dramtic depth and character that THE SIXTH SENSE had, this ending much more sad and the movie is much more elegant and wonderfully directed and stylized film- which ranks it over THE SIXTH SENSE(8/10), which I loved too.

Go watch this symbolicly textured film  (which can be taken in many different ways), or watch it for the beautiful Nicole Kidman, or to watch a classic ghost story thats SCARY!  Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job portraying a character who needs such a wide range of emotions.  The children are believable and the supporting cast is solid.  Nicole Kidman is let to show her acting talent with a tormented character who gets your sympathy and then throws at you her secret that you hope shes forgiven for.  The drama depth and symbolism is used wonderfully here.  She truly loves her children- but the loss of her husband, her isolation, and her childrens sickness drives her to the edge.  She is a deeply religious woman- where does she think she is?  She truly loves her children and it is a tragedy to see everything shes gone through with the loss of her husband.  Its scary as well and has the classic fog-ladden house and creepy bumps in the night.  It is stylishly directed and every action scene is directed with such intensity (I loved the scene in which the the children wake up in the morning to discover- well, if you watched it, you should know).  It reaches back into the classic horror stories of THE INNOCENTS and THE HAUNTING, who share a great deal with this film: the power and haunting and emotional depth as this film.  I loved this movie and it is one of my favorites.  It ranks with some of the best horror films and, besides all the script and deepness stuff, its a great thriller with some delightfully jump out of your seat moments and freaky scenes.  The little kids are adorable and it is delightfully creepy.  Watch, enjoy, and even tear up in this tragic story with character for the quality people, horror for the thrills.

In reality ""The Others"" is as Amenabar is quoted as saying...""leaving something to the imagination is the essence of real horror."" The year is 1945 and Grace, Nicole Kidman has a lot to be terrified about.  Her children are allergic to the sun and have to be kept in almost complete darkness and her employees have recently departed en masse without an explanation and have left her to run an old, giant, creepy mansion to herself.  Magically 3 former employees of the mansion arrive at her doorstep seeking employment.  But there is still the problem of strange voices and movement in the mansion to be explained.  Along for the ride are the powerful and sturdy Christopher Eccleston as Kidman's husband (excellent in ""Jude"" and ""Elizabeth"") Akima Mann and James Bently as her children and notably Fionnula Flanagan as her new housekeeper and confidant, Mrs. Mills.  Kidman is vulnerable,  high strung and intense as Grace, more like Lady Macbeth than Desdemona.  This is a big departure from her role in ""Moulin Rouge.""  Don't expect a ""Scream""-like film as this is more in the psychological vein of ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo.""  ""The Others"" is a slow moving adult movie and demands the experience and attitude of an adult to appreciate it.  Amenabar directed ""Abre Los Ojos"" previously, a highly regarded Spanish film starring Penelope Cruz now being remade in English by Cameron Crowe with Ms. Cruz and Tom Cruise.  ""Abre Los Ojos"" was an eclectic, unusual film while ""The Others"" is steeped in the 40's and 50's style popularized by Billy Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock.

The children, Anne and Nicholas, are afflicted with a rare skin disease that make the sensitive to light, prolonged exposure will cause rashes and even death.

In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.
The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled.

7918054,4,B00003CYLJ,"RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenbar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.

While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and theres a one-dimensional pale look to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.

Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid.

Dark manor, haunting music,  slamming doors, cracking floors effects that might sound corny, but its the way those effects are presented which makes the difference with other horror movies.
Not a drop of blood there but you will get goosebumps believe me.
The plot is very good and the acting is superb.
Nicole Kidman was the best choice the director could chose.
Like a pale and nervous Grace Kelly, she carries and delivers from beginning to very end with a flawless performance.
I would recommend to watch the movie a couple of times to fully enjoy it.",1525046400,,646,4.6173913043478265
