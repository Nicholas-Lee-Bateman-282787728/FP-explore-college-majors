8406721,3,B003VE9WQ0,It was good. Some of the episodes were a rendition of twilight zone.,1408579200,,68,4.3076923076923075
8406722,1,B003VE9WQ0,"First of all having Flava Flav as the host tells you not to take this POS seriously.  Second, the stories are so bad that a senile Rod Serling high on drugs could write stories a thousand times better.  The stories are so bad they're not even campy, and the twists are so dumb they make no logical sense. Let's not mention they shamelessly ripped off a great Twilight Zone episode yet managed to even screw that up. Third, the acting is just as bad as the stories, then again it is expected when the stories are ridiculously bad.
In conclusion this is something to be avoided at all costs.",1325635200,4,589,4.394495412844036
8406723,4,B003VE9WQ0,"It says this is not rated, but it is definitely not kid appropriate due to violence, cussing, and sexuality. With that in mind, it should entertain the grown ups. Nite Tales is a feature of episodes that each have their own storyline and are hosted by Flava Flav. If you don't like his music, not to worry. He makes a pretty silly Dracula, ""The Time Keeper"" (Like the Crypt Keeper, only Flava Flava always wears a big a** clock). As for the episodes, they are entertaining and creepy. The actors do a good job to keep you on the edge of your seat and sympathize (or fear for them) when needed (instead of laughing at bad acting). No spoilers, but it's fun to try and guess the plot and some of the episodes have refreshing plot twists.",1296518400,5,735,4.372262773722627
