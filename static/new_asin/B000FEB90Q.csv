8174920,2,B000FEB90Q,"its great that it comes with 3 dvds, however, the footage is irrelevant for todays youth. It is very boring, and not very entertaining at all. it is set in the 50's and just out of date. It would be better to see more dvds on this topic that are modern and that teens can relate and understand better.",1289692800,,301,4.11864406779661
8174921,5,B000FEB90Q,"I bought this for my girlfriend's bachelorette party and it left us in stiches.

We played it in the background while having cocktails and getting ready to go out.

We ended up getting sucked in and we could not stop laughing at these movies and ended up going out much later than we expected.

All I can say is that after watching these movies, my friend is more than ready for her wedding  night!",1146873600,4,398,4.337837837837838
8174922,5,B000FEB90Q,"I originally bought one of these DVDs as a single item but then bought the full package because it was a better deal than buying the other two as individual purchases. I should have bougtht the bundle pack at first because I would have saved money.

These are nice informational films that I will show to my grandchildren when they are old enough because they have the right set of values and will help teach them right from wrong.

I wish that there was more sexual education information like this out there because the children today have so many temptations.",1146787200,4,561,4.6
