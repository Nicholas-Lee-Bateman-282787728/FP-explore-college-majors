8129915,5,B000GAKSMY,"For those familiar with CHARLIE ROSE interviews, you know how in-depth they can be.  This particular conversation with SYRIANA director Stephen Gaghan leaves you breathless.  He shares some amazing stories about people he met and experiences he had while researching some of the places events like those in SYRIANA might actually take place.  Not to mention having ex-CIA agent Robert Baer introduce you to people.  Slightly frightening, but totally engrossing.  This is a highly recommended companion piece to the film SYRIANA.",1150761600,3,528,5.469135802469136
