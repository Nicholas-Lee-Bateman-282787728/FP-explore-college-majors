1232241,5,B00000JDIL,"I am happy that the 3 Sailor Moon movies are finally coming out and will be uncut.  Unfortunatley DiC practically ruined the first 2 Sailor Moon series and given it a bad name, so if you think uncut Sailor Moon is the  same way, it's not!  I have most of all the series subtitled and its a lot  better then the dubbed version.  Anyways this movie is cool, even though  it's not my favorite out of the three, but I recommend it for anyone who  has seen the Japanese Sailor Moon or Americanized version and likes it!",928800000,,514,4.237113402061856

I'm glad DIC is finally giving subs a chance, and I admire that they're letting an anime company deal with the dubbing and subbing (three cheers for Pioneer!).

1232258,5,B00000JDIL,"Im not even remotely ashamed of my love for this series. It had a big impact on me as a kid and my affection stayed strong into adulthood, be it nostalgia or otherwise.

Up until this point, I was ambivalent about Vizs redub if this series. Ive long since watched and preferred the original Japanese cast, but the highly-edited dub from the 90s had one thing going for it- the cast. As a result of that nostalgic preference, I felt the new cast lacked a lot of depth to the characters (with a few notable exceptions).

Pair that with the fact that the Blu-Ray releases have been just okay (I acknowledge the source material is old, so I cut some slack there), I was obviously skeptical of how this movie would turn out.

I was totally unfair. The cast shines here on a level I haven't seen yet- they put a ton of emotion into the script and even though Ive seen this movie dozens of times, I actually felt more invested in it that ever before- thats how strongly I felt the voice actors delivered here.

And the other criticism I held about the video quality? Proven wrong again. The color and animation detail were incredible- texture was on point and the colors vivid.

If this is the cast finally acclimating to their characters and each other, I cant wait to see what they do with the Sailor Moon S movie, which is arguably the best of all three in my opinion.

Five stars. Viz, ya did good.",1506211200,4,1395,4.366795366795367

1232260,4,B00000JDIL,"Movie looks great on blu ray. Its such a shame the series blu ray quality isn't anywhere near as nice.

This wouldve gotten 5 stars but the dub is dreadful and the artwork is so bizarre looking. It has a very cheap look to it and theres no reverse image or at least a pattern used. For whatever weird reason Viz didn't put much effort into the design of the movie.

I'm assuming the next two film blu ray releases will lool equally as jarring.",1502582400,,443,4.2

1232279,5,B00000JDIL,"OK, I want discuss a topic many have taken into consideration. This anime means more to a lot fans in regards to what they grew up with vs what they're are looking for today. It's evidently clear to create a new re-dubbed because some fans consider the Sailormoon's 90s version bad. Now for the fans of 90s anime as I am, I totally understand the disappointment in change. Not only with the voices, but  the strength put into each character at that time, stunning music soundtrack, and personality development has also changed. Know the new Sailor-moon or the re-dubbing is not for the NOSTALGIC fans of the 90s; neither do each episode give you that strong powerful anime as it did in your childhood years. So for those seeking the dubbing uncut with the English voices and names of the 90s, you'll find you can still buy that version complete series excluding the movies on amazon for a limited time (expensive) and leave the new version to people who may like it.

Now there are some good things about the newer versions of Sailor-moon that the 90s version didn't pertain. For instance, the story-line. In the 90s version, the Sailor-moon Princes known as Zoisite is female while in Japan still remaining a male. And yet this isn't the jest of it. The storyline of Zoisite and Malachite as lovers never happened. Instead each prince is destined for one of the sailor girls like Usagi (Serena) and Mamoru (Darien) are destined. So when this anime came over to america, it changed and I do mean A LOT. Know that the Sailor-moon Crystal version is working on changing that so people who are fans of Sailor-moon can get the authentic story. However, its very plain and cannot stand on it's own due to its predecessor. The re-dubbed version of Sailor-moon isn't horrible but neither is it great except correcting the problem with Zoisite's voice.

This movie in my opinion is the best Sailor-moon movie out of them all and even though its re-dubbed, try to give it a chance. A lot clearer than the original if you care a lot about anime graphics. I couldn't bring myself to give it a bad score because I've loved it since my childhood. It won't have that strong and powerful music or the voice casting vibes, but it's still a pretty good movie. If you haven't seen the 90s version, you won't care either way and will still give it a good review.

For my end note, it seems all the versions of sailor-moon should have been combined in the 90s so that way it can satisfy all but this won't happen. There are clearly just too many different versions. So be careful in what you pick and take a look at anime TV shows while making sure to purchase the one you want.",1494979200,,2658,4.542797494780793
1232280,5,B00000JDIL,"I first watched this film on VHS from Pioneer Entertainment which was entitled ""Sailor Moon R: the Promise of the Rose, the movie.""  Pioneer butchered it horribly. It is now just titled ""Sailor Moon R: the movie"" - thank God!! I cannot give a review on the dubbed version, as I do NOT watch anything, especially anime, ""dubbed;"" this version of the movie, however, I received as a gift for Easter from my mum. Perfect. I don't think there is another word for it. I've watched the subtitled Japanese anime (yes, ALL 200 episodes), the specials, the live action version, Sailor Moon Crystal, and all three of the movies, as well as Ami's special, too!

1232283,5,B00000JDIL,"like so many I was scared that the transfer of this long time classic anime would get ruined like all the current redub releases but this floored me as how nice transfer from the original cut into this HD remaster, this is what the fans have been begging for since they announced that they would be giving us a release into Blu-ray and all 200 episodes with a full English redub vs the dic-pioneers dubs, this was a fantastic English redub and a much more accurate dub to boot, was floored when the girls thought that mamou (darien in the original dub) might be bi or even gay which for the time this movie actually came out was unheard of at the time, no real spoilers but I have to say if your curious or intrigued this is the edition to get.",1494288000,,744,4.246478873239437

1232285,3,B00000JDIL,"While I understand that this is a reboot of the series, I was pretty disappointed by how different this was from the VHS version.  Promise of the Rose was by far my favorite of the movies and this was kind of anticlimactic for me especially because they changed the song at the end which was perfect in the other version. I still love Sailor Moon but definitely wish I could relive my childhood version.",1493510400,2,403,4.445945945945946
1232286,5,B00000JDIL,"As someone who posted before me, I completely agree with their review. I will not add any more to it. However, I noticed that during the movie, (and the Make-Up short) you cannot toggle on/off subtitles nor can you switch between the English and Japanese versions of either. Also, the songs are not subtitled even when the option to do so is in the main menu. I do not know if it will be an issue that would be resolved later on. Other than that, the movie is top notch and a definite must-buy for any avid Sailor Moon fan. Thank you ViZ for bringing this to us the way it was meant to be seen.",1493424000,,594,4.129310344827586
1232287,5,B00000JDIL,This release was amazing. The voice acting and script for the viz version was outstanding. The only negative thing about this release is that the songs are not subtitled.,1493251200,2,170,4.896551724137931

As soon as I got it in the mail, I watched it and I think it is better than the original version. I like the new dub, better than the 90's dub, but I still prefer the Japanese with English subtitles. I still have the 90's DVD and VHS version, but I am really happy to see this looking better than ever on Blu-ray.",1493078400,5,445,4.126436781609195
1232289,3,B00000JDIL,Disappointed in this version it's not the original one released in the US :(,1492992000,2,76,4.5
1232290,5,B00000JDIL,"Lol, yes 90s children, this is not a re-release of the earlier DIC version of this film. This is part of Viz Media's restoration campaign of the Sailor Moon animated 90s series and films along with the Crystal reboot. So if you're buying this expecting to relive the adventures of Serena, Darien, and friends then prepare to be disappointed.

Or maybe not. I, too, grew up watching the US version of Sailor Moon back in the 90s and while I also miss the English cast from that edition it has been awesome to watch that series again in its original Japanese format. For me it's been like watching the Director's Cut of the series. I applaud Viz Media and the fervent devotion of Sailor fans everywhere for this Sailor Moon revival.

Anyway, I watched the blu-ray of the movie and it looks great. Visuals are crisp and bright, sound is good, the English dub is okay but I preferred the Japanese track with subtitles. I honestly don't fully recall the original VHS version but something tells me the gay subtext between Mamoru and Fiore was downplayed because, well, it was the 90s. Welcome to 2017 where that aspect of the story is on full display. No beating around the bush here.

Only hiccup I saw was the first reveal of Fiore's asteroid. Hey, it was the dawn of CGI so, yeah, compared to today's standards it is on the rough side. Then again, it's a big rock. It's not supposed to be pretty, lol. Also took a minute to get back in the original Moon mode. After immersing myself in the more serious minded tone of the Crystal series I had to readjust for the slightly lighter version of the 90s series.

The story is like a condensed version of a Sailor Moon season. They go from everything's fine to battle action to valiant self-sacrifice within a 90 minute time frame. Complete with all the heightened melodrama, friendly hijinks and heated monster fights that Sailor Moon-heads have come to love. Hoping Viz Media will release the other movies sooner than later. I'll definitely be buying.",1492905600,,1995,4.6112676056338024
1232291,5,B00000JDIL,"There is little to be said about Sailor Moon that is not already general knowledge by anyone even vaguely familiar with anime, Japan, or girls who fight evil wearing mini-skirts. One of the most popular and well-known icons worldwide to come out of Japan, Sailor Moon continues to experience popularity with all manner of people, not the least due to VIZ Media's revival of the franchise in North America.

After years of beginning this revival (and in fact, finishing the series on Hulu in Japanese with subtitles), VIZ has finally released Sailor Moon R The Movie. Known with the subtitle ""The Promise of the Rose"" to American audiences, the film has been given a new and much more proper translation. The voice actors are the same as both Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon Crystal (Stephanie Sheh as Usagi/Sailor Moon, etc.). The end result is leagues better than the trite nonsense done by the original North American release, and the movie stands on equal footing with its Japanese counterpart. Of course, the Japanese audio with subtitles is also available, if that's what one prefers.

The movie is basically just an hour long episode of Sailor Moon. The plot involved Mamoru's childhood friend, Fiore, who disappeared but makes a sudden return now, with some less than savory intentions. The always popular stock footage transformations and attacks are still used to pad the run-time, but there are some original displays of force in the film. All the girls get a good amount of screentime and chances to shine individually and as a group of friends. While the movie does mainly revolve around Usagi and Mamoru's relationship, her friendship with the rest of the Senshi is still given great importance to her character and strength.

The Blu-Ray, to me, looked great. Colors were crisp, vibrant, and it's the best the movie has looked ever. The voice acting is wonderful, from the laughs to the yelling of attack names (""MOON PRINCESS HALATION!"" What even is a halation in this context?) Stephanie Sheh, as Usagi/Sailor Moon, is particularly noteworthy for her performance, and I'm also a big fan of Amanda C. Miller as Makoto Kino/Sailor Jupiter.

Finally, the new translation is faithful to the original text. Most notably, the new translation does not shy away from implying that Mamoru and Fiore's relationship could easily be more than friendship. Usagi and the rest of the girls comment on the fact that Mamoru could like men. Another notable fact is that their dialogue is also very accepting, which I believe is actually a bit different and more progressive from their dialogue, regarding the aforementioned relationship, in the original Japanese version.

As I stated, there's not much to say about Sailor Moon that is not known. This is a great movie to watch if you are a fan, were a fan, or think you might become a fan. Highly recommended, and thank you to VIZ for their revival of one of my favorite childhood franchises.",1492732800,8,2937,4.913306451612903

(Seriously though, I'm just writing this review to be the 700th reviewer...) BUT! There's still no reason why fans of anime old and new shouldn't watch this classic. To me, its a great door opener to the world of anime! The animation is spectacular for its time, it has a great plot and the drama is so great! Even as a 7 year old, this movie made me kinda sad cause it swept me off my feet!

As for the movie itself, id say its the best out of the three because of its plot and the intense battles. This is the toonami edited version...which is the version I prefer! The uncut movie's japanese music is kinda too orchestrated and the DiC music is just cool and catchy! Children 7 and up can watch this because some of the action scenes involve impailing and intense violence (though the edited version removes the moments of impact). There's brief nudity and a brief conversation of gay couples (which is airbrushed out and completely omitted in the edit) and the story might be too dramatic for a kid to understand.

A great one hour movie that should be re released by funimation, whenever they decide to relicense sailor moon! The 2012 remake anime is something that's still gonna be something to look forward to as well! Buy the edited VHS version and record it to a DVD while they still exist!

1232325,5,B00000JDIL,"Having fallen in love with the Sailor Moon series since I was a little kid, I would never have missed out on any of their 3 spectacular movies. Sailor Moon R the movie (Promise of the Rose) takes the viewers further into the prior stories of Serena (Usagi) and Darien's (Mamoru's) pasts since being reincarnated on Earth.

Despite the fact that most anime lovers are far more interested in SUBS than DUBS, however, this dub has it's ups and it's downs. One of the many ups of this Uncut DVD is that it maintains all of the original Japanese background music (with the exception of the opening theme performed by Nicole & Brynne Price) composed by the late Takanori Arisawa. As a dub viewer, I don't mind the DiC cues, however, on the VHS/TV versions of this movie, I feel that the DiC cues didn't belong. Another up I will point out are the voices. As a Sailor Moon fan, what really drew in viewers like me to the dub were the voice actresses, including Terri Hawkes, who is picked very favoribly among fans. The character voices, overall, were above par for the most part, although some fans dislike Luna's ""British"" accent voice. Something else that seemed rather dark to me was the point where Serena was utilizing the Silver Crystal while being shown semi-naked. Although the edited VHS/TV altered some scenes to an extent, the keeping of the scene completely intact represented an element of Serena's purity and innoscence (and NOT fanservice, as what some people like to view).

There were not a whole lot of downs to point out in this film, but one thing that can be improved were some of the corny lines. Although I grew up listening to lines such as, ""I will triumph over evil, and that means you!"", and others, I feel those lines didn't belong in the film either.

Nonetheless, this is an anime dub done right. Despite Sailor Moon's global hibernation since 2004 (though today, that hibernation is weakening because of her 20th anniversary in Japan), Sailor Moon R the movie, both dub and sub, is a stellar anime movie deserving far more attention for today's age.",1308787200,,2074,4.66120218579235

Sailor Moon and her friends meet a strange young man who seems infatuated with Mamoru (Tuxedo Mask)named Fiore (Sp). It is revealed that he is possessed by an evil flower who is trying to turn earth into her nesting ground. Although it has nothing to do with the ""R"" series, it is beautifully drawn and written.

When you see that opening logo with the beach and the japanise marks, you would think your about to watch a Godzilla movie. This movie is good for the average anime fan even if they don't care about Sailor Moon, it also apeals to fans who grew up watching the show.

To make matters worse, Fiore kidnaps Darien. He is also responsible for the massive meteor/flower-planet that's on a collision course for Earth.

Testing the bonds of friendship and reaching deep inside to find their inner strengths, the Sailor Scouts must come together to thwart the threat before it's too late.

The story's straight forward, basically a bad guy coming to get his friend back but causes trouble because he's under the influence of an evil flower so Sailor Moon and the gang need to stop him. But the simplicity works for the film.

This was a fun anime--light, cute, even, um, flowery. It's loaded with sparkles and glitters and shiny objects, very ""happy"" compared to most anime this reviewer's seen.

There's an air of wonder to this film, most notably when the Sailor Scouts activate their powers and Sailor Moon calls out, ""Mooon Crystaaalll Poweeeerrr!""

I finally did when I got this DVD.  Everyone was right.  Although the dub is still pretty good, the original is even more better.  The dialogue is more accurate and doesn't include major cheesy lines like ""MOON MAMA"" *cringes*.  The original music is also 100 times better.

Usagi and her friends are enjoying a day at the local greenhouse when all of a sudden a strange man appears and seems to know Mamoru. Usagi seems very freaked out by their encounter and keeps thinking about it. The next day, Usagi and her fellow senshi find dozens of people laying on the streets--their energy sucked dry. The cause of the energy drain? A monsterous flower of course. After fighting and defeating it Fiore (the strange man) appears and he's not alone! The Kisenian blossom is what is behind it all. After attacking her fellow senshi and eventually accidentally wounding Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Moon and her friends must travel to the base of the enemy to save Mamoru and the earth!

I loved this movie and can watch it over and over again (and quote from it). We see great love and a true friend in Usagi as she has to fight her battles.

I first saw the movie in the edited English dubbed version and then saw it subbed many years later. This DVD however contains the UNCUT dubbed and subbed versions. The dubbing however is the same as the edited version but the uncut dub includes several scenes that were not in the edited version. I reccommend watching it in the subbed version of course (like all anime is suppose to be watched! :-D) I love the original voices and feel that the original voice-actor/actress gives real emotion to his/her part which the English-dubb fails to do.

 As the Moon Princess's reincarnation, Tsukino Usagi has a beautiful transformation that makes her become the Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon (Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon). With the help of her friends, Mizuno Ami/Sailor Mercury, Hino Rei/Sailor Mars, Kino Makoto/Sailor Jupiter, and Aino Minako/Sailorvenus (each the reincarnation of the princess of their respective planet), and her true love Chiba Mamoru/Tuxedo Kamen, she has succeeding in saving Japan---and the world---many times. This movie has her facing a new alien threat: Fiore and the Kisenian Flower. It appears that Fiore is Mamoru's childhood friend, and the Kisenian has taken control of Fiore's feelings toward Mamoru, twisting them into a possesive jealousy. Fiore even goes so far as to take an injured Tuxedo Kamen with him to his headquarters, an asteroid covered in flowers which hold a dark power. Of course, Sailor Moon and her senshi go to the rescue,  but with Fiore and Kisenian testing their love for each other to an ultimate extreme, can they save Tuxedo Kamen---and themselves?

 -PROS-

-Each Sailormoon movie is a stand-alone adventure (they were released theatrically in Japan), so you don't have to worry about not knowing any of the characters or plot.

-This movie has an awesome climax, which in my opinion is the best ""final battle"" scene of all three movies.

-Usagi and Mamoru's love shines in this movie (the R in the title stands for Romance, after all)

-Fiore was probably the best villain in all of the movies.

-The dialouge is funny, sharp, and witty (at least in the Japanese version).

-This is my favorite movie of the 3 Sailormoon movies. Awesome music + awesome characters + awesome plot = one a$$ kickin' flick.

-CONS-

-Well, in the Japanese version, there aren't any to speak of, but the English version is GODAWFUL. If you have any taste you will watch this movie with Japanese audio and English subtitles.

-This is the uncut version. That means (very brief) nudity. Of course, the nudity is feauture-less (check out the screen shots from SMuncensored.com to see what I mean), but nonetheless you should be warned. The nudity is not implied sexually at all, but more to suggest purity, so it's not hentai. I would suggest the uncut version over the dubbed version anyday, because the dubbing company (Optimum/Cloverway in the movies' case) butchered this beautiful anime to bloody bits and pieces.

Any Sailor Moon fan should have this movie, and even if you're not, you should give it a try nonetheless. Ja ne!",1114992000,,2522,5.028846153846154

My rating is for the Japanese version of the anime, not the English version.  I would've rated a ""-2"" for the English version.  Never have I seen such extra dialogue in the first 15 minutes than in any other anime.  There were so many filler lines in the movie that the majority of the lines have been changed (and most sadly, dumbed down), altering the plot as well.  If you're interested in hearing outdated slang quotations and somewhat pompous attitudes from each of the Sailor Scouts, go and get this DVD.  Enjoy such phrases such as ""Go get 'em, Moon Mama."" and ""Yep, it's me.  Don't wear it out."" when you hear it in English.

Get this DVD for the Japanese version.  Where else can you hear ""Moon Revenge"" with all of its emotional impact emphasized within the moment in the song.",1101427200,,991,4.579545454545454

Now that I'm a little older, I still enjoy it, but notice some cheesiness every here and there that, nautrally, I didn't notice when I was younger.  I personally like how this movie focuses a lot on Serena and Darien's relationship, which was one of my favorite parts of the Sailor Moon series.  It just goes to show that even cartoons can be romantic!  The Sailor Scouts are cool, and easy to relate to.  There is, of course, the brainy one, the hot-headed one, the tomboy one, the glamorous one, and the clutzy but courageous Sailor Moon.  Then there is Tuxedo Mask, not a Sailor Scout, but a companion in crime-fighting. And how could they make a Sailor Moon movie without the Sailor Scouts' cute kitty companions, Artemis and Luna?  Also included in this movie is Sailor Moon's daughter from the future, Rini, who is followed everywhere she goes by a floating toy called the Luna Ball, if I remember correctly.

This movie DOES alter how Serena and Darien originally met in the TV series, but it doesn't really bother me that much, because it makes a cuter movie.  There is, of course, a happy ending that leaves you feeling good and accomplished, though waiting for more.

I would recommend this movie to any Sailor Moon fan, or Japanese animation lover.  But I would recommend Sailor Moon S - The Movie over this one.  I believe that it is the best Sailor Moon movie, but that is just my opinion.

What I hated about it is that Luna's (the black cat) voice didn't match her at all. I've seen some Sailor Moon episodes in Japanese and her voice sounded much better. But overall... the movie was good, so I suggest that you buy both movies ( dubbed and Japanese) and decide for yourself.

The only problem is if you're watching the english version the Japanese movie songs are playing not the english songs for some reason. What's really good about these tapes are you get to see both versions of the show. I must say the Japanese version is much better than the english version....,1066089600,,455,4.428571428571429

I've watched one subtitled version and I hated it.  All I did was read the subtitles and I didn't watch much of the beautiful anime.  I did not care for the Japanese subtitled versions at all.  The dubbed versions are perfect...everyone should stop saying mean stuff about those cool episodes!!  Dubbed is the best!!  hehe  That is all I have to say.,1052697600,,522,4.457446808510638

1232352,4,B00000JDIL,"Yet another great addition of Naoko Tachuchi's Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon. This story takes place after the second season of Sailor Moon, or more commenly known as Sailor Moon R.
Usagi, Chibiusa, Ami, Rei, Makoto, Minako, and Marmoru are all taking a day off of fighting the forces of evil, and decieded to travel to a green house. Then a mysterious man appears calling Marmouru his best friend. But how can he be Marmouru's friend, if he dosen't know the idenity of this stranger?
The following day, when the girls are heading home from a day at school, Rei senses a great evil, and soon the girls are hot on the trail of a sinister plot. When they find an entire street full of unconcious people, it is then when the senshi realize that they are needed to save the world once again. The demon who was responsible approced the Sailor Senshi, but as always, the demon was killed. But then the same mysterious stranger that called Marmouru his best friend, appeared, revealing his true nature. His name is Fiore, and his has an unknown orgin from the great abyys of space.
When Fiore was young, he drifted aimlessly around space untill he landed on Earth. Upon landing his meet a young Marmoru. In the lonelyness and pain that Marmoru suffered from his being orphaned, Fiore suffered for not knowing just who is ture orgin was. Soon the two became inseprable friends, always joined at the hip. Yet all this joy would soon have to end. Because of Fiore's unknown and alien heritage, he had to leave his best friend behind, or else he would die. Just prior to leaving, Marmoru gave Fiore the only gift he received, a red rose. After saying his good byes to his best friend, Fiore vowed that they would meet again, and that Fiore would find the perfect flower to give to Mamoru upon his return.
For many, many years, Fiore searched the heavens for the perfect gift to bring back to his best friend. Then he found it in the form of a small pink flower, with the small torso of a demonic woman growing out of the center of the petals. This flower is called the Kissinian bloosom, was actualy the last element that Fiore needed to turn his pure heart into a heart of dispair and hate.
The Kissinian Bloosom was really a demon in an innocent form, who's only goal was the gather the engergy from every star and planet in every known universe. Alone, Kissinian is just anthoter ordinary flower, but once she has a pawn to do her bidding, she spreds her pods on unsuspecting planets. Soon the pods bloosom, and drain the energy from the planet, and the pawn is killed. She has been doing that very same process for millions of years. And the process would start all over again with her newest pawn, Fiore. By using Fiore's loyalty towards his friend Marmoru, she minipulates Fiore into thinking that Marmoru has been living a life of Hell on Earth. Out of his friendship for Marmoru, Fiore returns to Earth, in hopes of being reunited with the friend that he had once known, and to take is revenge upon the Earth by planting Kissinian's energy sucking pods on Earth, and turning the beautiful planet into a world of emptyness.
Soon, the Sailor Senshi embarke on the perilous task of entering space, and putting a stop to Kissinian's bitter plan. And to rescue Marmoru from the cluthes of Fiore. But has Fiore really lost all of his former purity? Can he be saved? Or will the Earth and the senshi fall into the hands of despair.
The dubb has a number of problems, and that is what keeps this DVD from getting five stars. But you can choose to watch the original, and get the qaulity of five shiny stars. In the dubb, why do most of the senshi have voices that sound like thirty year old women? Also, why dose Luna sound like a freaking old englsih granny? What the heck is a moon mama? Why is the theme song so freaking annoying, all it dose is says 'she is the one named Sailor Moon' over and over and over. It just gets annoying after a while. The wonderful Japanese song called Moonlight Revenge is replaced with Power of Love. But the song Power of Love was already entered in the next to the last episode of the R season. Like I said, the dub has problems, but you can always overlook that, and enjoy the splendor the the Japanese original",1045353600,,4234,4.471576227390181
1232353,5,B00000JDIL,"With great trepidation, your loyal reviewer has dared to make is way into one of the most sacred icons of Japanese popular culture.  Beautiful Young Girl Warrior Sailor Moon (Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon), with over 200 episodes to its credit in addition to this film almost single handedly created the 'magical girl' genre.  'Sailor Moon' has had so much influence that one has to delve into it, even if its lighthearted (and slightly empty-headed) thematic structure is not quite ones cup of tea.  This film, with the help of a bit of research, is a perfect introduction.  In a short hour, the viewer gains a very good idea of the series' values.
Without getting too bogged down in mythic references, suffice it to say that young, slightly klutzy, Usaki Tsukino (Serena) discovers that she is a reincarnation of the Moon Princess.  She can transform, has a set of formidable magical powers, but regardless of the gestures, incantations and fancy costumes, still remains the same affectionate, caring woman she is in real life. Here friends (Sailors Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury) as well as Tuxedo Mask (Mamoro), her romantic interest, are all cut from the same mold.
Set against the in this film is Fiore, who, as a young alien boy, had become close friends with Mamoro.  Fiore had to leave earth, but promised to return with a gift as precious as the single red rose Mamoro gave him as a parting present.  Unfortunately, Fiore's quest becomes distorted when he falls under the power of the Kesenian Flower, which poisons his love for Mamoro in its own schemes to destroy the earth.  The ensuing struggles are full of the contrasts between the tender affections all feel and the bitter vengefulness that the Kesenian engenders.
To get a picture of how good this film manages to be, on has to keep in mint that a story this full of sentiment an magical poses could easily have been a cloying, silly extravaganza - killing the viewers sympathies with an excess of sweetness.  Instead, by keeping the humanity of the characters as a subtext, and emphasizing the familial friendship they feel for each other, the film transcends both cloying romanticism and excess moralizing.  Graphics and animation are a bit oversimplified - but the results are enjoyable.  If I have a criticism it is the amount of time spend transforming and readying the special attacks.  With all that posing and telegraphing of moves, it is a wonder they do not miss more often than they do.  All of this can be forgiven though in the enjoyment of a truly warm and upbeat film.",1043971200,7,2552,4.799086757990867

This isn't an anime just for kids. People here have the concept that Sailor Moon is a kid's show. Far from it. Some of the images in the uncut version from Japan are quite intense, and is laced with some adult humor as well.

At first when I saw this movie, I was confused, since I had never seen the R season, but I caught up with the story pretty quickly.
The plot is very organized and consistent, and it was very explanatory if you were confused about a particular element.
I think that the whole movie was entertaining and I liked it even through the end of the credits.

It shows how much she means to each of the other scouts.  She is so loving, caring and TOUGH when it really counts.  The last scene in which Raye is destraught over a dead Sailor Moon is so great.

Its not just soppy either, for people who don't like that stuff, there are some very cool battle scenes (did anybody else cringe when Jupiter hit that phone booth?) and a very cool song ^^

Definately use the Japanese with English subtitles, as the American voice actors get VERY irritating very quickly.  This DVD is a culmination point of the Sailor Moon Series R, so it has everything a good Anime should.
Sailor Moon is my favourite anime because it was one of the first anime to show that females are each different, and those differences are a positive and valuable characterestic of someone.

1232371,5,B00000JDIL,"The best of all 3 Sailor Moon Movies. Although I absolutely prefer the sub, the dub was not so bad. Sure they edited stuff, but that's common already. In the original, there's a bit of controversy about the relationship between Mamoru (Darien) and Fiore (Fiore). By that I mean homosexuality. Of course, Mamoru is straight and in love with Usagi (Serena) so that thought is nixed. But I found it funny, the way Usagi got all worried, thinking her Mamo-chan could...no way! He's not like that! LOL Very funny. But in the dub, they just make them seem like friends, and just make it seem like Usagi is worried because he's keeping secrets. Not too bad. What I thought was unecessary was to cut alot of the fighting scenes. Some portrayed the Senshi (scouts) crashing agains telephone booths or windows. These were cut and only show you the end result, while in the sub they show you how they crash and got hurt. Another thing, when Sailor Moon is caught by Fiore and is being drained. I loved this scene in the sub, it was very eerie. The music gave you chills (think something out of Dracula, a woman chanting, very freaky). The music along with the visuals just gave you goosebumps and made you worry about our gal. But in the dub the put incredibly cheesy music and does nothing to you. You just look at it like: Whatever... And the part that hurt the most. Moon Revenge is not there :( sniff sniff. Probably one of the most popular SM Japaneese songs, Moon Revenge was the song that played while Sailor Moon fought to save her friends. The music went perfectly with the movie. But, they changed it to The Power of Love. But, again, it was not so bad. The music is catchy, and goes with the scene also. Many moonies fret and overreact:""They changed the music, cursed be them all!!!"" But, remember, this is a dub. Obviously the music's gonna change. The songs'll be in English, not Japaneese. Over all, I give the movie 5. It's my fave Anime Movie and fave Sailor Moon Movie. Both sub and dub are good (tho subs better).  ...",1001635200,,2025,4.487804878048781

1232380,5,B00000JDIL,"If you're already a fan of Sailor Moon and you're reading this review, well, why haven't you bought this yet? :D The format I recommend most is the DVD, but the subtitled VHS is fine if you can't play DVDs. Steer clear of the edited dub VHS though. But in any case, buy! Now! But to be honest, any Sailor Moon fan is guaranteed to like this, so this review's mostly for people who don't know much about Sailor Moon and are deciding whether or not they should take a chance and buy some, and if so where they should start.
So, what does Sailor Moon (or, to give it its full title, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon) have in it that might appeal to you? Well, there's romance, action, and... teenage girls who are true friends but seem to argue an awful lot. This movie doesn't focus as much on that third part as the series does (which is actually a shame since most of those kinds of scenes are really funny), but the romance and action are out in full force. This movie's about friendship, loneliness and flowers, strange as it may seem. And it deals with these themes pretty well - you get quite an insight into the childhood of Mamoru and Fiore, and also Usagi's ability to unite people and end their loneliness. Plus there are some funny little scenes between Usagi and her long-suffering boyfriend Mamoru. As for the action, there's a typical Sailor Moon-style battle scene made up of stock footage of attacks combined with cheesy disco music (which anyone with a sense of humour will like better than the boring music played in the edited dub), plus a great insert song scene at the end (""It's moon revenge, oooh...""), if you'd count that as action.
While Sailor Moon isn't for everyone, it has things that would appeal to a wide range of people. And don't let anyone fool you into thinking it's for little kids or girls only - the box recommends it for ages 13 and up (an unreasonably high age limit, but proof that it would appeal to that age group), and I actually know more boys who like it than girls (I'm a boy, by the way, and a HUGE Sailor Moon fan :)
Anyway, if you've decided you want to buy some Sailor Moon but you're not sure where to start, this is the perfect place. It works many of the most memorable scenes from the first series around a new storyline that doesn't spoil too much for you, and unlike the series it doesn't take 20+ episodes to get into the actual storyline. Plus the only current legal way of getting the first two series is in edited dub form, which takes away a lot of the enjoyment.
Although I said in my review of ""Sailor Moon S: Heart Collection I"" that I didn't object to people watching the dub instead of the sub, in this case I feel differently. The dub is *mutilated*. The script and line delivery are just awful. While I wouldn't call it the worst movie I've ever seen by any means, the power and emotion of the original are just lost. The uncut dub's only real merits are that it has nothing actually cut and that it uses the original music. The edited dub doesn't have either of those, and the cuts are pointless and the music's just not as good (I know I'd take a widely-varied original orchestral score over boring reused synthesizer music that all sounds the same). That's why you should steer clear of the edited dub VHS and buy the sub VHS or DVD instead.
So basically, if you're a Sailor Moon fan you're safe buying any form of this (except perhaps the edited dub, although if you're really desperate or a young child there's no reason why you couldn't enjoy that), and if you're new to Sailor Moon this is the perfect place to start. Have fun ^^",990835200,3,3598,4.3796711509716

1232394,4,B00000JDIL,"This is the first movie of the most well-known anime series ever, Sailor Moon!! This is my favorite anime series ever!!  Okay, enough with that, this movie, Sailor Moon R, is supposed to take place during the R season (doom tree, negamoon series) when Chibi-Usa (Rini) was still in the past *she hadn't gone home to the future, which is at the end of the R season, she comes back in the S season*. This movie is mostly based on Mamoru's (Darien's) past when he was in the orphanage; he was all alone when he befriended a young alien named Fiore. They became really good friends until Fiore had to leave earth. Mamoru, saddened by Fiore having to leave, gave him a flower *a rose* to say goodbye. Fiore, touched by the gift, searched all his life for flowers to bring back to Mamoru. In this movie is when he returns, and doesn't want Usagi (Serena) or any of the other soldiers to get in his way!! I won't spoil anything else for you :)
I really recommend this to Sailor Moon fans, but if you're a ""moonie"" and you've only seen the Cartoon Network Sailor Moon, here's some facts about the original *and much much better* Sailor Moon.
Names
Serena-Usagi or Usako as Mamoru calls her
Amy-Ami *that's hard, ne?*
Raye-Rei
Lita-Makoto, or Mako
Mina-Minako
Darien-Mamoru or Mamo-chan as Usagi calls him
Rini-Chibi-Usa
Luna and Artemis have the same names
Other stuff
the girls in the japanese version use -chan after each other's names. In Japan, this is used by people to express friendship with each other. The only exception is Rei, who just calls Usagi ""Usagi"", which means she has a closer frienship with Usagi than the other girls.
if -san is used after a name, it means that the person who said it is showing respect to that person, for instance, the girls *except for Usagi, of course* call Mamoru ""Mamoru-san""
Usagi calls Mamoru ""Mamo-chan"" *a affectionate nickname* while Mamoru calls Usagi ""Usa-ko"" *an affectionate female nickname*
Okay, i'll end it here
Bottom Line: pretty good, if you're gonna get it, learn some facts if you don't know the japanese!!",979516800,4,2060,4.674931129476584
1232395,5,B00000JDIL,"I absolutely love this DVD.  Whether you are a fan of the dub or the sub with this DVD you can get your fill of both.  The story is excellent, the best of all of the movies.  It has alot of drama and action and it really reveals some of the relationship between Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask.
Parents may think to not let their children view this DVD because of what many people see as the gay relationship between Fiore and Tuxedo Mask but that was not my impression from watching this DVD. In watching the DVD you get the feeling that Fiore is acting like a child who had his best friend taken away by another child and is now striking out at the one who took his friend away.
The DVD itself is very well done with the ability to see the movie in english, in japanese with english subtitles, and you can even see it in just japanese if you want.  Although they kept the japanese song Moon Revenge in even the dubbed version of this DVD you can choose to go and look at just the ending of the movie with the song The Power of Love.  There is also the ability to see the english opening for the movie and you can look at character profiles for many of the characters and see some of their attacks and transformations.
The only problem I have with this DVD is the voice acting and scripts for the dub of the movie.  As is usual for Sailor Moon dubs the voice acting is not very good and the script does not follow the original very well. But leaving all that aside if you are a Sailor Moon fan or even just an anime fan this is the first movie you should go buy.",978652800,,1559,4.078431372549019

This DVD is a must have because it has not only the UNCUT dub but also the Japanese version and Japanese Subtitle version.  It also has a nice little photo gallery, quick bios on all of the Sailors and the song ""Power of Love"" from the cut dub version.  The animation is great and so is the story.  Plus there is an apperance of Princess Serenity, which is always a plus.

The story is basically about 'giving and returning'. There is quite  a lot of meaningful themes to this story. Themes like friendship, forgivingness etc. It might sound a bit sloppy but I think it means a lot to me.  What really happens is that Tuxedo Mask gets captured by this alien who he once rescued when he was a child. He gave a rose to the alien when the alien had to leave the planet Earth promising him a bunch of beautiful flowers on his return. When this alien sucessfully finds a flower from outer space he was mesmorised by the spirit living in the flower!

First of all, the action sequenses are top notch, the animation is good, (nowhere near the quality of SS though) and it is humerous enough for a few good laughs, such as their transformation calls in English, (Sailor Juptah!). The plot of ""R"" concerns a childhood friend of Momoru's (Darien in the dub) who comes back from space to fulfill a promise they made when they were kids, hence the name ""Promise of the Rose"" in the dub. Not only does he (fiore) come back with a rose but a Kasemien Blossom who wants to take over the world by crashing a giant meteor into Earth filled with her life-sucking flowers. Fiore captures Momoru and takes him up to the meteor with him, away from Usagi (Serena in the dub) who Fiore considers a ""rival"" for Momoru. After that Sailor Moon and the scouts proceed to teleport up to the meteor to try to save Momoru, the world, and Fiore from the evil control of the Kas. Bloss. This, unlike the dub, is definatey not intended for kids. There's mild language by Mikato (Lita) and Fiore, a few scenes of violence, a little sexual references to Fiore being gay and, as Ami put it, ""Momoru seems to be popular with the boys as well."" Finally, as in all the subs, the barbie doll like nudity that comes with their transformation phases. All of the above is edited out in the dub and not so subtle I should add. All in all this is a great movie. The flashbacks on the meteor are wonderful . The scouts remembering when they met Usagi and why they have such a deep freindship with her was a nice touch. The dub didn't hold up very well though. The voice actors, translations, diologue, and editing of the movie was too much for me. If you saw the dub and thought, ""this would be good if it wasn't so,"" what I like to call ""kiddy-fied,"" then watch this one, the way Sailor Moon and all anime is supposed to be watched; unedited, subtitled, and not  butchered by companies like Dic and Cloverway who sell these shows to 3-10 year olds.",973814400,3,2056,4.354166666666667

I  must admit that I liked the dubbed version that was on TV but when watching  this DVD, I didn't care for the dub...because Sailor Moon is much enjoyable  watching it in Japanese with the subtitles (if you don't understand  Japanese that is).
So, that out of the way, let's talk about the movie.  The movie is actually pretty good.  Touching in some areas and it'll maybe  make you want to cry.  When people buy this, they may think they can just  buy this for their kids but if you want to explain to your children about  homosexuality references and so forth, then go ahead and buy it.
The  only disappointing thing for me is the sound.  Why is the movie done in  mono?  Oh well...
The special features features the image gallery and  character information which is something that should be on most if not all  anime DVD's with a large character cast.  I am glad they included both  languages for the purists and the dub fans.

Power of Love replaces Moon revenge but it fits somehow. However, I will  say the one thing that really irritated me is that they altered the ending  quotes. In the subtitled Sailor Moon says: ""I told you I would protect  you all."" and in the dub she says: ""So from now on when i say  it'll be alright, you'll believe me?"" But like the s, if you're a big  fan, worth it. I'm not a die hard fan yet but I'm getting there.

1232420,5,B00000JDIL,"This is the best Sailor Moon movie out there. A long time ago, Mamoru (a.k.a. Darien) meets a boy by the name of Fiore. They become good friends. But Fiore must leave. Mamoru gives him a present, a rose. Many years later,  Mamoru and Usagi (a.k.a. Serena) are at a garden together, and Fiore  reappears. It turns out he wants to repay Mamoru for being his friend and  giving him the rose, and he wants to destroy everyone else on earth for  leaving Mamoru alone. It's up to Sailor Moon and the Sailor Senshi (Scouts)  to save the day! There is very little material which parents will complain  about - Makoto (a.k.a. Lita) Does say ""Damn"" twice, there is a  mild homosexual joke about the relationship of Mamoru and Fiore  between  the senshi in a scene, and there is a nudity scene involving Sailor Moon at  the end of the film. But nothing is shown - Everything is covered up with  ribbons. The Daimons (Monsters) are also a little exposed, but not  eye-popping. I was more interested in the fighting then in looking at the  exposed scene. There is also a little violence, like the senshi getting  rammed through glass, and into a wall. But you can't have Sailor Moon  without a little violence.  This version was better than the dub in my  opinion, but for newbies to Sailor Moon (A new watcher), go see the dubbed  version. They say stupid things (a.k.a. Go get 'em Moon Mama!), and stuff  is etited, but it is easier to understand if you are a newbie to Sailor  Moon.  Why did I like this movie? First off, the plot was interesting.  It just wasn't ""Bad guy takes hostage, gets chased, good wins"". It  was more like ""Bad guy takes injured friend and saves him, is chased  by good guys, and ultimtly becomes good"". Second of all, this movie is  not very confusing, compared to the S and SuperS movie. However, some parts  of the movie are boring and you might just fast foward over. Other than  that, it's a great movie.  Well, I gave it 5 stars. Sailor Moon R is a  good movie that includes comedy, drama, and lots and lots of flowers.",963705600,,2040,4.423180592991914

The story tells a good portion of Darien's past, while interesting...if you don't like Darien it  can get a little annoying. However there is some good music and the  storyline is fine. I bought the movie a while back the minute I saw it, and  was only very slightly disapointed by the fact it mostly starred Darien.  Fiore looks very much like Allan and Kasenien blossom is up there on my  list of best villains along with Princess Snow Kaguya. Even if you DON'T  like Darien get this movie anyway!

I must say that they did a better job editing the  R movie than the first 2 series shown on CN. I'll give you a little  background of the movie without spoiling. The three MAIN characters are  Mamoru (darien), fiore, and Usagi (serena) The movie really starts to tell  the story about 20 minutes into it. And fiore basically kidnaps his  childhood friend , Darien. I don't want to give much away so if you have  questions mail me @  jupiter-4@sailormoon.com",962582400,,628,4.504424778761062
1232426,5,B00000JDIL,This movie is the best of the three. I think that this movie has a much better storyline than the S movie. I believe that this is the one to choose because people can relate to what is going on because they have seen the R  series on television.,962323200,,245,4.0
1232427,3,B00000JDIL,"I have not yet seen the Japanese version, but I believe people when they  rave about that one, because by most everyone the Japanese versions are  considered much better.  This movie in the dubbed version is rather boring,  more for the people who love the action in SM, and don't really care about  the story.  (Half-Plant Half-Human creatures that live off other living  beings energy are sent to earth as a gift from some boy who's name I can't  remember to Darien, because when they were in an orphanage together, Darien  gave the boy the only gift ever given to him:  a single rose, which  originally was a gift from Serena.)  The boy has intents to kill Serena  with the plants, (and take over the world), because he believes that Darien  must choose a friend:  him, or Serena.  For my taste, this movie isn't the  greatest.  I personally recommend even the dubbed version of Sailor Moon S,  which is also good for the younger moonies and Luna fans.  Also, I don't  really recommend watching any of the movies before you've seen some  episodes of the show.  (That's what I did and I got REALLY confused.  Is  Alan that kid????  And who's Friolle????)  Over all, this is more an action  movie than anything else, but if you're one of those people who live to see  any of the Sailors attack, get this movie.

1232428,5,B00000JDIL,"First of all, this has to be my favorite video so far!  I'm waiting on the Subtitled version of Super S but I definetly LOVED this movie!  There is really nothing that should be censored from the youth. The nudity is barely  visible and concealed in an interesting fashion that I consider artful and  modest.  There are few anime out to date that deal with things more than  sex and violence.  This is a must buy considering the fact that this movie  actually has a plot (and quite a good one)
I've heard that the ending  song ""Moon Revenge"" on the subtitled version is much better than  the ""Power of Love"" on the dubbed version.  However, ""The  Power of Love"" is an awesome song!  Unfortunatley the dubbed version  can be...can we say..a tad cheesy at times?  For instense, Sailor Moon  calls to Tuxedo Mask, ""Be careful..my masked man!""

It has a differenrt opening sequence and music, etc. etc. but theBIG reasoni like the uncut is because before Sailor Moon beomces QueenSerenity,  shes covered only by ribbons. In the cut, theres a mess of them (although  they're see-tyhrough)but the uncut has less ribbons and they're practically  clear! ^_^ and also the skirts are shorter.. actually thats not the real  reason my freind kinda pointed that out.

Ooooooooooohhh! It's payback time! So he gives these scouts heck  for not surrendering their love for Darien and Sailor Moon will do whatever  it takes to make this creep understand that he can be friends with them,  but it takes a lot to get him to  understand, but I'm not going to tell you  how it ends. I knocked off a star in my four star rating in this movie  because about once or twice it began to slow down, although it did pick up  again quickly. I also got rid of the star because they hardly showed Chibi  Usa! She's one of my totally wicked cool favorite characters! But all in  all, it was a really cool movie. Hey! It's Sailor Moon!

The dubbers didn't hack it to pieces as expected and the voice acters brought real emotion to their characters and the movie in general.  The reason I didn't  give it 4 stars is because I like the song ""Power of Love"" but  let's face it, it's plaguerism to use it twice(it was used in the end  episode of Sailor Moon R series), plus ""Moon Revenge"" was an  awesome song!  The other reason is that at the end scene when Sailor Moon  is revived it doesn't have the same emotional angst that the Japanese  version has.

I feel that this movie is good for anyone of all ages.  I don't  believe in shielding your child from sexual and violente things, this movie  does have some kinda violent scenes, and an almost naked Sailor Moon,  nothing real graphic though.  So if your like me and feel that children  should be exposed to the more pleasent and unpleasent things in life, this  is a good move to show them because is it very tame when it come to what I  talked about before.

The  dialoge is somewhat changed like when Sailor Mercury is suppose to say that  Tuxedo Mask is popular with boys too...instead she says that everyone is in  love with him.  The only thing that's was really corny for me was when the  scouts are transforming, their names are being sung in the background.

This is the first anime dubbed movie I've seen with no  script butchers.  But I really don't think that it should have been rated  ""Ages 3+"".  If anything, it should be ""Ages 10+"".  I  was really surprised that DiC didn't cut as much as I had expected, and the  cuts are just the opening theme, when the Sailor Senshi were riding on a  bus to the greenhouse, that was replaced with screen shots from seasons S  and SuperS, and a cut which involves bloodshed that's about a second long,  so you aren't missing much.  Also, I really liked the music that DiC  composed.  DiC composes some excellent music, which makes this movie  worthwhile to see.  They had some music which I've never heard in the  series that really impressed me.
Coming to a conclusion, this movie has a  very good plot, keeping true to the original, and when I give this movie  five stars, I'm really serious about it!  DiC is slowly pulling themselves  together, and they're not as paranoid as they once were.  So my suggestion  is to get the movie.  It's a must buy.",959472000,2,1203,4.556603773584905

You can't figure out what's  going on, and so I say that the subtitled version is better because you can  actually follow along without getting confused by the storyline. And what  is with the music to the movie! They first have smooth jazz, then  classical, then some sort of cha-cha music, and this goes on through the  entire movie!

The original opening was left out and replaced with the stupid She is the one thing. In my opinion the  original opening was a important part of the movie because it explains how  every one got to the gardens! Also the Moonmama thing was just pathetic.  WAY to much corny dialog changes ! I recommend taking your hard earned $  and go by the subed version. Oh ok their is one good thing about this  movie, The changed Mars Fireballs Charge to Evil Spirits Disperse. A MUCH  better translation of the origanal.",958262400,,621,4.4035087719298245

Naoko Takeuchi really made this one a classic...Personally, I'd like anything Sailor Moon but this one really is the best one..Like they say first is the best. Now,  I hear some people say that this movie has nudity in it. Well, technically,  its brief nudity..So the movie should be at least rated PG-13. Now another  thing, is because fo the cursing, or cussing may I say it as, Sailor  Jupiter may have said a word 3 times in the movie, but it should be too  hard to notice it. So kids under 13 could watch to if you are not affended  by brief nudity or brief language.",958089600,,630,4.2521008403361344

I then ended up buying the subtitled version, and surprisingly there weren't many cuts made  at all.  The story was just as grand, just as emotional in both versions.  Serena and her friends (Sailor Moon & The Scouts) must battle the Demon  Seed, which gives host to a flower that has taken over Darien's (Serena's  boyfiend) friend from long ago, and in the process Serena nearly dies.  It  really is a beautiful story, suitable for all ages from 5 to 55.  Just  amazing.  For the younger ones I recommend just the dub, but for older  children and older anime fans, I recommend watching the dub AND the sub.  It's worth it.  Believe me.",958003200,,764,4.5

Anyway, in the dub, Luna sounds around 50, but in this version,  she sounds eighteen. Moon Revenge, the fight and end song, is FANTASTIC,  and Moonlight Densutsu is extremely awesome. I loved the comedy in it, and  the heart. Firoe is *ahem* somewhat blatant with his feelings towards  Mamoru (This is not for little kids, mind you.), and he annoyed me  immensely. ^_^ Ah, young love.  I've barely taken it out of my VCR. It's a  good buy, and so are the other movies. Usagi, Mamoru, Makoto, Rei, Ami,  ChibiUsa, Artimus, and Luna: The majority of the Senshi, and the sum of the  ""R"" season.

Fianally  Luna doesn't sound like an old lady! Ami sounds better, well, they all do!  They don't sound like freaks anymore! Their attacks sound better.  ""Fire soul"" sounds a lot better than ""Mars fire  ignite!"" I saw what I was missing! I ordered the other two subbed and  they were cool too! The R movie was the best!

That  part is hilarious!  I also like the part when Chibiusa gives Usagi the  little pep talk in the tunnel.

Minna doesnt call anyone a pervert,and Jupiter does not curse.of course they added lines,and Darien gets the worst. He goes  on and on about how flowers make him feel happy.

I've never seen the original but the document  is proof enough. I would've loved Toby Proctor's voice for Tux but that's  the way things go sometimes...

Oh well. I like the comedy  parts of the movie,also. The subtitled edition is definitely geared toward  a more mature audience whereas the dubbed version is for the younger.

Overall, i can't really complain though, the majority of the  original plot was there and i do like the English version, just not as much  as the japanese.  I think its a great way to keep Sailor Moon going though,  and for that i am happy.  Oh, and just for the record, yes they meesed up  Sailor Mars' attack...they combined ""Mars Fire Ignite"" with  ""Mars Firestorm Flash"" (the attack she used against Katzi while  defending Chad in season 2).

1232483,4,B00000JDIL,"First off, I want to say that SMR is a good show regardless of your age.  I bought the sub VHS and loved it.  I was curious, however, as to how the dub would turn out.  I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the VHS  dub.
From the very beginning, I was annoyed w/ how the dub was done.  The  dialogue between the dub & the sub are completely inconsistent.  They  basically rewrote the entire story for the dub.  By doing so, a great deal  of the plot was lost.  The dub lacks emotion but is full of all sorts of  tired cliches and pap.  It is a shame too because so many SM fans have  waited (impatiently) for the SM movies to be brought to the US only to be  disappointed in the end.
I do, however, highly recommend the sub version.  The story flows well, the characters become more developed, basically its  a true pleasure to watch.  I promise you that once you watch the sub and  see the movie in it's original form (short of the subtitles), you'll never  watch another SM dub.  If you HAVE to have the dub, get the DVD and make  sure you have the english subtitles on.  Only then will you see just how  insipid the dub is.
I hope that they do not ruin SMS or SMSuperS the way  they ruined SMR.  Much as anyone would hate to admit it, not all teenage  girls sound like... how did Fiore put it (in the dub)... a dingbat?  Nor do  they use words that end in ""oid"" (geekoid - ugh, that makes my  skin crawl).  Get with the program folks - teenagers (for that matter, kids  in general) are a bit more educated and mature than how they are portrayed  in the dub.  I only hope that when the time comes to dub SMS &  SMSuperS, the storyline remains untouched.",954115200,3,1653,4.091194968553459
1232484,1,B00000JDIL,"I'll start off by saying I love Sailormoon R.  This movie, however, is not Sailormoon R.  It is a horribly destoyed dub that ranks up there with the work of Dic and Funimation.

Songs repeating because they aren't long enough to  fit in the original's place, Dialogue dumbed down to a three year old's  level with such things as ""moon mama"" and ""wicked weed  indeed"", gotta LOVE that bad voice acting, too. God, I hate to think  what the S movie will be like... If your a fan of the Japanese version  (like me) STAY AWAY! this movie is scary. Terri Hawkes has the most  ANNOYING voice on the planet. All she can do is scream like a wounded  animal and say ""wicked cool"". Suprisingly, they didn't actually  cut much. Only one or two scenes. Please, don't pay for this movie.

If your child is old enough to follow  subtitles, you have nothing to worry about in buying them this wonderful  video. Even my three year old could tell what was going on just from the  pure emotion the Japanese voice actresses (and actors :) put into their  lines. You can't help but feel what they feel whether it be joy, sadness,  or pure mischief. ^_~* Something I find lacking in English dubs.

Hardly any of the scenes were cut out, except Tuxedo mask getting impaled. But I was surprised at  all the stuff they kept in. INCLUDING RINI'S GUN!  The thing that irritated  me was all the stuff they dubbed over. Almost none of the dialogue was the  same. And they cut out Jupiter's ""dammits,"" and of course Ami's  comment about Mamoru being..uhh.. not straight was changed. And some of the  stuff they said was just so stupid. The typical dippy stuff that DIC had. I  hated especailly Artemis' ""a most wicked weed  indeed."" I shudder  when I hear it. The lines just aren't as dramatic as the sub either. They  never actually say that Usagi will 'die' if she uses the crystal.  Apparently little kids aren't supposed to know about that stuff. She just  'gets her energy drained' as usual. Not the same, I tell you!  Most of  the voices are the same, including Terri Hawkes as Sailor Moon. Sigh. She's  an excellent voice actress and everything, but does anybody remember the  old Sailor Moon voice that was only in the first ten episodes or so? I  thought she was awesome, and I'd give just about anything to have her back.  Also, the cats got on my nerves. Their voices are just annoying in the  dub. I don't know about the S movie, guys. If they keep Luna's original dub  voice for that one, it'll be a long movie. She just sounds too old to fall  in love in the english version.  Wanna know what really ticked me off  about the dub? They took away the opening ""moonlight densetsu""  and Moon Revenge, and plugged in the English theme song with scenes from  all three movies and ""the power of love."" ""The Power of love  is a great song, and really worked for this movie, but wouldn't you rather  hear English versions of ""moon revenge"" and ""densetsu?""  The best voice in there hands-down was Fiore. I'm not sure, but I think  he's the same person who voiced Keichi in ""Oh my Goddess.""  Fiore's voice was perfect. He really shined in this movie, even thoug the  dub makes him seem more evil than he really is. He's not a complete evil  jerk, really. He was just lonely. -sniff-poor baby!  I don't know whose  bright idea it was to make the dub into a kid's version. What I'd like to  see is a COMPLETELY unedited version with the same voices, but all the  original dialogue everything.  It sounds like I've totally trashed this  movie, but really it's worth getting, just to hear it in English. It wasn't  edited as bad as DIC would have done it, and it still got me and my little  sister teary-eyed. The sub is much better so you should definently see that  before you see the dub. But both versions are worth seeing.  btw, DIC lost  the rights to Sailormoon, but I heard that Cartoon netwrok is planning to  air the R movie this spring, after they view it first and EDIT IT MORE!

What is it about Sailor Moon? Perhaps  the innocent approach to the wisdom of the heart? This open romanticism is  something we need more of these days; too many children learn early to  scorn the idea of courtly love between the sexes, and  to embrace  meaningless sexual symbolism instead, and Sailor Moon is one series that  defies that trend.

Yah, yah, I know there were a few messed up places, but over all I have to say that it was a lot better than the ones DiC had done. (Thanks Pioneer! ) Although they could  have done better by *not* using phrases the character never uses, like Moon  Mama, Tuxedo, masked man, Moon Princess Elimination, etc. Also some of the  attacks were messed up. I absolutely *loved* the ending where Tuxedo Mask  sees Princess Serena and says ""My love"" then stands up and turns  into Prince Darien. It gave me chills all the way down my spine! Also the  way he held his arm around her and helped her hold the crystal. It was so  romantic. The ending song fit it perfectly. The Power of Love gave you the  idea that the Sailor Scouts were giving Princess Serena their power and  love, which was exactly what they were doing! I also loved the part where  Fiore gave Darien his life flower to save Serena, and you can see Darien  kiss Serena. Absolutely perfect!  Although the ending could be more stonger  than just ending with everyone talking. Call me crazy, but I thought that  it was very well done, and the ending was *the* best part in the whole  movie.

The great features  includes: The vhs opening scenes w/ the american sailor moon opening song,  the cut Power of Love Ending, pictures from the movie, clips from the movie  with little bios, AND AND the option to revert to japanese w/ subtitles for  you purists. In the subbed version, not only do you get the translation to  Moon Revenge but when the credits role, you'll get both translation and  japanese romaji. ^_^ The image quality on the DVD is 1000x better than the  vhs(or my fansubbed one) A must for any sailor moon fan.",952473600,5,877,4.43125

In the tv show, sure the sailors have said some corny things  but moon mama surpasses them all.  3)Some parts of the movie weren't  faithful to what happened in the series. 4)The battle scenes weren't  anything special. they were basically a copy of previous battle scenes. It  was like 'been there done that' for the viewer. 5)the plot was overly  maudlin and corny. they could have came up with something better or at  least executed it better.

I must have seen the Japanese version a thousand times before I purchased this  video, and it ruined me.  Rini's overabundant use of the word  ""Mama"" was absolutely annoying.  Not only did the makers change  most of the content from a Japanese to an English oriented format, but they  weren't consistent with uses of the attacks, nicknames for people, etc.  For instance, what was ""Moon Princess Halation"" in Japanese and  ""Moon Sceptor Activation"" in English (during the series) now has  become ""Moon Princess Elimination.""

Gripes: Darien's and Raye's  voices sucked, and so did Fiore's. The children voices of Fiore, Darien,  and Serena weren't very good. But DiC didn't cut out much.

Occasionally  they did go overboard.  ""Do your thing moon mama!""  Gag me.  The  options for subtitles and japanese dialogue is nice too.  Though I did miss  the transformation and battle music.

Granted, it's the same voice acting that everyone else is complaining about, however considering the amount of  time between the last release of ANY Sailor Moon Dubs (i.e. last 17  episodes) and now, I think they did a pretty decent job.  I didn't like the  extra verbiage, like Moon Mama from Chibi, which just made me want to  cringe, but the kids seemed to like it just fine.  My hope, however is that  some of this feedback will go back to Pioneer to make the Sailor Moon S  Movie a better Dub, and make it hold true to the form of the original,  which a lot of us seem to have, or have viewed through various  sources.
My children have watched the Sailor Moon series since they were  2 and 3 (currently they're 6 & 7), so I'm not quite sure why Pioneer  has listed the release as 13UP (the transformation sequences maybe?), when  in Japan, it was clearly for the younger set of kids (4 to 7 or 8 I think  it was)... By the time the kids are 13 and up, they really won't be into  this type of series anymore, but I could be wrong.
All in all, if you  want to be able to compare the subbed, dubbed and original, the DVD version  is for you... It has all original voice acting with out the mandatory  annoying subtitles that the VHS version gives you, plus it has the extras  like the official Bios of the scouts, the English and Japanese  transformation sequences and powers... The extras alone make the DVD worth  getting... Now if you could only find the DVD version in stores for the  people that do not have computers...

It's a good movie overall, but a bit more story would have  been nice.  Still, it's got moments of greatness - Chibiusa's method of  ""reviving"" Usagi will have you wondering whether or not your DVD  player is stuck on pause. ;-)  As for DVD quality, it's top notch.

It is bad enough that DiC had to RUIN Sailormoon by dubbing the first two seasons(which they did very poorly, in my honest opinion), but did Pioneer have to ruin the Sailormoon R movie,  too?

Both of those were first rate.  It was those terrible voice  actors!  Gracious, but when I first heard the intro, Terri Hawkes (as the  voice of Sailor Moon/Serena) practically deafened me.  Also, all of the  voices sounded particularly strained as though they were trying really hard  not to screw up since they obviously haven't worked in a while.  Of course,  many of the lines were corny and unnecessary.  One scene had Rini calling  Serena ""Moon Momma"".  If that doesn't induce nausea, nothing  will!  Another scene replaces Usagi's ""Tuxedo Kamen-sama!"" with  ""The man can wear a cape!  Woo!""  The movie also put too much  emphasis on friendship and not enough on love.  My advice is to buy the  subtitled version if you really want to see it done right.  If you're a  person who prefers dubbed, still buy it.

I REALLY liked her voice after that. Well, and  now for the downsides. The many downsides. First thing I noictied  was...Serena's voice. Urm...I didn't think you could overact a voice.  UUGH!  Serena's voice was sooo annoying! It took away from her dialog!  Speaking of dialog, EVERYTHING they say in the original is CHANGED. I  thought this was the UNEDITED version. Rini's lil line ""Don't worry,  Sailormoon is protected by moon power!"" should be ""Don't worry.  Sailormoon is everyone's mother. She'll protect us."" And they still  say stupid stuff like Luna: ""The planet is covered with mega plant  engery!"" And they changed the attacks. GOD!  Supreme Thunder Crash  wasn't to bad, but..Mars Fireballs Flash!

This movie shows Sailor Moon as it was meant to be  seen.  All the characters are true to thier real selves, instead of what  DIC made them into.  This movie is a must for all ture fans and even for  those who just like the show.. In its original form there is no way for you  to be confused by uncomfortably dubbed scenes that try to block out what we  consider inapropriate.  This movie is suitable for American children no  matter what anyone says. We just have to accept some parts of life that  Japan already has.

1232541,5,B00000JDIL,"I actually saw this video over a year ago by buying a pirated subtitled version from Canada. I'm pleased to say the subtitled version sold here at Amazon.com is just the same (save a few differences in the subtitling) as  the one I bought a year ago.
There is a meteor filled with thousands of  energy consuming seeds of a pink flower called, as my verion names it, the  Kinesan flower. It preys on lonely, depressed, weak willed beings and uses  them as a vehicle to consume whole planets of all their energy until,  finally, the subjected planets die. Here, the lonely Fiore becomes victim  to the flower. You see, he once had the then recently orphaned child  Mamoru, but this alien found that Earth's conditions were too much of a  strain on his body, so he was forced to leave Earth, and Mamoru. Years  later, Fiore stumbled into the flower, and it promised him he would have  Mamoru again if he polluted Earth with her seeds, and so Fiore set towards  Earth on a meteor carrying thousands of them. In the process of the film,  each character realizes how much one's friendship means to the other,  especially in relation to Sailor Moon: ""We would all be alone if we  had never met Sailor Moon; please don't kill her!"" If I tell you  anymore, I will destroy the story!
The animation is very well done. I  could rave about the color, and the fluid motions, but one scene in  particular sticks out in my mind. In the end, Sailor Moon seems as though  she has died. The camera catches all the faces of the sailor scouts crying  and screaming at her to wake up, but if you don't blink, and watch Mamoru  closely, you will see him literally become human as the artists catch the  diffucult to duplicate expression of shock, denial, and extreme sadness --  all in one expression. That scene alone makes me cry everytime I watch the  movie.
WARNING: As for which verion to buy -- subtitled or dubbed -- I  was worried that certian scenes would have been edited out in both Pioneer  versions. For example, there is a scene where all the scouts, and Mamoru,  are on the meteor fighting Fiore, trying to save Sailor Moon from him. He  had her held tightly to him with several hands and tentacles -- whatever  you call them -- and was draining all of her energy. The problem was it  looked as though Sailor Moon were being crucified. She was tied up to Fiore  exactly as Jesus was to the cross -- with arms extented and bound outward,  legs tied together, and Fiore's fingernails pressed into her forehead like  Jesus's crown of thorns. This was the main scene I was sure would have been  censored; however, in this SUBTITLED version, it is still there. I CANNOT  speak for the dubbed one, though. So, beware, for there may be this big of  a difference between the dubbed and the subtitled verions.",950918400,3,2792,4.49402390438247
1232542,1,B00000JDIL,"This is the worst incarnation of Sailor Moon I have ever seen. They took a lot out of it, mostly really great music. There was a lot of dead silence in some scenes. Also, some scenes are shortened and the voices sound  different from the TV versions. The dialogue they added is insipid. When  Rini said, ""Do your thing, Moon Mama!""

But if you're like me, and have already seen the three movies in Japanese or the series to that matter this movie will suck eggs. There  is dialogue that should not be there, unnecessary dialogue (one of the most  stupid is when Mamoru stops Fiore with his cane, Usagi or dubbed Serena  says ""Be careful my masked man"" in this horrible sugar-sweet  voice).It's expected that the homo-sexual references would be edited, it is  dubbed for a 4-12 audience, but well, it wasn't as good as it could have  been, which could have been much, much better. The only good thing about  this is that the USA has made Sailormoon more available to Americans that  are not able to see the original series, which might open up for future  dubbing for other anime.",950918400,,832,4.530201342281879
1232545,4,B00000JDIL,"This is the best of the 3 Sailor Moon movies based on the hit series. However, the translators of this Pioneer production seem to have forgotten to upgrade the dialogue to match the more adult, unedited DVD version. For  example, Tuxedo Mask is called Sailor Moon's ""best"" or  ""special"" friend - not her boyfriend, as is clearly the case.  There are also some errors, such as the film's villain, Fiori, referring to  the Moon Scepter as the Moon  Wand, and some awkward changes in dialogue,  with Rini calling Serena ""Moon Mama."" That bit of dialogue sounds  more like a pick-up line than something a child would call her mother.  However, the balance of the dialogue is well done, and the voices of the  characters are reprised by most of the original cast.",950918400,,758,4.681818181818182

In the  Japanese version they have good voices.  If your a true sailor moon fan  you'll get the subtitled. You'll never get to experience the japanese  version if you don't get subtitles. You'll go on thinking DiC did a good  job. If you get dubbed you won't get to here how Usagi really sounds. So  much is edited it makes no sence. Don't get this movie dubbed!

1232547,4,B00000JDIL,"I love SM, but I was a little disappointed by Pioneer's (the producing company) DVD. The English subtitled / Japanese audio version is wonderful, but I don't like what was done with the English audio. My main complaint,  is that the audio doesn't follow the subtitled (most accurate) translation,  and the point of the movie was changed. The second thing, is that they left  the Japanese music (which I love) along with the english words. The result  is funny at best and makes me wince in pain at other times. I've seen SMR  on VHS subtitled where DiC's music cues were used. Although parts were cut  out, the English audio/music is better than the E.audio/J.music, although  Tuxedo Mask sounds like Allan!  It's WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! In conclusion, I  love the DVD for the English subtitled/Japanese audio version and some of  the extra stuff on the DVD like character info and clips of  attacks&transformations. Too bad the English version didn't have the  English music, and too bad they didn't stick to the subtitled words. They  changed a lot.

I hated it i sat there  trying to figure out what was up with ami's voice and whats up with fiore  he sounds like bill gates. Pioneer also adds needless talk we can see  they're flowers, we can see fiore is disappearing. and the seedlings talk  when in the japanese they don't. plus they put power of love for the  endding song didn't they already use that? Compose a new song!  Can you  tell I don't like the dubbing job, there are a lot of other things i  disliked but I leave that to you to find because I may excede my 1000  words. If you are getting this for your little 4 year old child then i  would recommend it but as i have found many Sailormoon fans are above the  age of 12.

Moon Revenge and Moonlight Desentu were on there. But the English had the  DiC song and the Power of Love in there instead. I may be 12 but it's a  great movie. And Darien/Mamoru's flashbacks were great! We fianally know  more about Darien's past. But I can't stand Rini and Serena fighting  anymore! This movie dub and sub is NOT for little kids. It may say 3 and up  on the dub but it should really be 13 and up. There were too many lines cut  out and changed.

The english version has additional  monologs/narative and and some good plays on words.  When you do a word for  word translation like the subtitles seem to be you loose a lot of the 'word  play' that is in the orginal japanese.

Which is only helped  by my monthly Manga of the orginal series.. Any way Sailor Moon R:The  Promise of the Rose  Is great for Children and the Hard Core Sailor Moon  fans who miss the series.

I will definetely be buying the S  and SS dubs (and I hope Pioneer makes them!) because R was good and S and  SS were just as enjoyable as R in subtitles, so it should only get better!

1232573,4,B00000JDIL,"By now you've probably ascertained the Sailor Moon R movie is, by general consensus, the favorite of the three. But how does the dub hold up? Well, it's not Princess Mononoke, but it is a Silver Millenium ahead of the  butchering done to the battle with Beryl. Yes, the dramatic tension is  toned down, and yes, there are a few censoring edits, but they're minor.  And quite understandable considering the age level the video is geared  towards. (Pioneer certainly isn't about to tell three year olds that the  best way to revive someone is to suffocate them until they wake up.)  Children who love Sailor Moon will adore this dubbed version. As for the  older crowd (and I presume we all already own the subtitled version) the  dub grows on you quickly. I've always been willing to forgive poor Terri  Hawkes's cheesy dialogue in favor of the sheer energy she gives to her  character. Stephanie Morganstern in particular screams a very passionate  ""Don't!"" as Venus rushes to her Moon Princess's defense. We mourn  the loss of ""Moon Revenge"" but ""The Power of Love""  works surprisingly well in it's place. At first I thought Fiore's voice  sounded too adolescent, but in retrospect it gave the character a snese of  warmth that the Demando style aloofness of the sub never really achieved.  My advice: buy the sub and give it all of your otaku honor. Then buy the  dub, cringe through the less-than-inspired plant puns, throw your best MST  commentary at the television, then calmly admit to yourself that down  inside, you really do love these girls deeply and are already searching  Amazon for the S Movie's dub.",950227200,32,1615,4.782608695652174

They cut out soooo much of the original  in this movie, and I will admit that while i love the vioce acters, alot of  the dialouge is down right cheesey.  But, despite the hacking of the scenes  (and moving dialouge), its still the Sailor Moon we all first fell in love  with from TV.  Great for die hard fans that need everything Sailor Moon.

Finally I gave  up hope on getting one with Chinese subtitles (even though I can barely  read Chinese, but I had ""Sailormoon SuperS the movie"" with  chinese subtitles and that was pretty good) and bought this one. Turns out,  the subtitles were nothing like the dubs.  I am soooo glad I got this one!  This movie was my favorite even before I saw it, because I knew the plot.  I was soooooooooo happy when it arrived!  I watched it 4 times that day and  2 times the next day!  It's pretty short (1hr) but has a great plot and  great music! ""Moon Revenge"" sounds even better in the movie than  in the cd!  My brother hates Sailormoon, both him and my sister prefer  Pokemon, and they both thought it was great too!

It's a work of art actually.  They changed some of  the diaolog to make Mamo-chan a nicer guy.  Ami's smart now! (Instead of  just restating the obvious like she normally does)  And yeah I bet some of  you were missing the ""I'm sorry, Mamoru's MY boyfriend."" line,  but I thought the way Pioneer changed it was really funny and creative.  Oh  yeah, and all of the DiC voices GOT ACTING LESSONS.  Whooo hoo!  And the  battle/ transformation music used (created?) for the movie dub, was ultra  cool and gave a very nice effect.  Except the exclusion of Moon Revenge.  :*(  I missed that . . .  They replaced it with ""The Power of  Love"", used in ep. 88.  Which I gusess is ok if they had to replace it  with anything . . . (Couldn't they have kept/subbed the song?  I know they  kept the Fushigi Yuuigi theme subbed.)  Speaking of which, they changed  Moonlight Densetsu to the DiC song.  Not as though it mattters to much -  they chaged the scenes that went with it!  Now it has scenes from all 3  movies, and the way they did it now even the stupid DiC lyrics, ACTUALLY  MAKE SENSE WITH THE SERIES.  And oh yeah, ""With her other sailors to  help fight...""  YAAAAYY! The Outers are in them, the Outers are in  them!  I NEVER thought I'd see them in the DiC song!  Yippee!  Do you know  what a victory this is?  And DiC never got their grubby hands on them.  ::smile::  And they'll be speaking english.  I hope they change Setsuna's  VA.  The one DiC gave her doesn't fit her at all.  Even less then Ami.  Oh  speaking of which, all rejoice, the english accent is dead!  At first I  thought it was a different VA.  But then I saw the ending credits and saw  it wasn't.  She sounds radically different.  It takes as bit of getting  used it, but I suppose the change is good.  (Of those of you want an idea  of what she sounds like, think Yui, from the american Fushigi Yuugi.)

Even if you don't like Sailor Moon, you will still love this movie. It starts out pretty simple, but then it gets alot of action and drama.  Darien's childhood friend comes back, but he is not alone. He, brainwashed  by the Kisenean Blosson, steals Darien, tries to kill the Sailor Scouts,  and tries to take over the Earth. It is a great movie for anyone to watch  (althought I would not recomend it to younger kids, its more of a mature  anime). I bought it the first day it came out, and so far I have watched it  at least 1 time a day (more like 2 times, actually). You have got to get  this awesome movie. It has alot of emotion, unlike some other anime today.  It will drive you to tears of sadness, then tears of joy, and then back  again. If you have not yet purchased this movie, I don't know what you're  thinking. Rush to the store near you which sells this movie, or buy it here  at Amazon.com.

Maybe its because I am so used  hearing Usagi's ""real"" high pitch voice, that Terri Hawkes voice  just doesn't get my excitement going for the movie.  It was also no suprise  that Pioneer used the song ""The Power of Love"", I had an instinct  they would because that song fitted the scene well, but still...Moon  Revenge rules.

Most anime fans will be more pleased with subtitles than with a dub, but I have to give some credit to Pioneer.  They kept the original Japanese music  cues and left most of the dialogue very similar, if a bit cheesy.  The only  scene that was drastically altered was the scene when Ami is speculating  about wby Fiore and Mamoru have such a strong connection, and while that is  disappointing it was to be expected.
This version was much better than a  DiC version, and since it is on DVD, it is unedited and has both the  subtitled and dubbed versions--viewers can choose for themselves.  It also  has some great added features, like two versions of the end (with different  music) and two versions of the opening (the edited and the unedited  versions).

The English version is tailored  for the younger crowd but surprisingly stays true to the Japanese version.  The story is much more in depth than a typical TV episode and deals with a  lot of serious issues like friendship and loyalty in a powerful and still  entertaining way.  Yes there's some violence and a little nudity (nothing  blantant, a few lines here and there but the important stuff is ALWAYS  covered up).

The first time that I watched it I had spent around 3 hours downloading it from a site that I had found on the internet.  I feel  that the time spent was well worth it.  When I got the chance to buy it on  VHS I snapped it up and bought it as quickly as I could.  The villian is  one of the best that I have ever seen ((and he looks like Ali/Alan to  boot)).  I'm not sure that the dubbed version is gonna be as good because  it'll be cut and you need to see some of the homosexual themes in the movie  to really understand the feelings of jelousy that Fiore has towards Usagi  and Usagi has towards Fiore.  Of course Mamoru just has to be in the middle  of it.  Personally I think that Usagi could do a lot better but that's just  my opinion.  The battle with Fiore on the asteroid is awesome.  And how at  the end he gives up his life and energy to save Usagi because of his love  for Mamoru.  The soundtrack is one of the best that I have heard.

It would be even better if there was a soundtrack to  this...(i.e. the scene when the asteroid is toted away by Princess Serenity  and the gang, put ""The Rockafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim...)",946339200,,354,4.515625

The only nudity is Barbie doll style, the D word  slips a couple of times,and there's a short conversation about gays. Other  than that ,no Problem! (those of you who don't like subtitles, it sounds a  lot better to hear the japanese voices, and after about watching it 5 times  you don't really have to read them.)

It takes place in the R series but it's not perfectly clear as to when in the series this event  takes place.  However it has a fully developed story, plot line and  outcome.  Be warned though this movie's villian is not a being from the  evil universe that the series normally follows.  Its a new villian that  lasts only in this movie.  Trust me if you like Sailor Moon because of its  storyline you'll love this.  I was skeptical of it at first being only an  hour long but I was wrong it was quite impressive.  I believe anyone who  enjoys the Sailor story lines of the series will like this movie.",945907200,,730,4.343283582089552
1232619,5,B00000JDIL,"The Sailor Moon R Movie is by far the best of the movies. It has an intriguing plot, something that American viewers don't get to see much in Sailor Moon, and great art as usual. The best part, however, is that it's  translated word for word from the Japanese. Which means DiC didn't hack it  apart and edit it for younger children.
Take note, this is definitely not  for younger children. First of all, the main villain is gay. To quote  Mercury: ""It appears Mamoru is popular even with the boys.""  There's also cursing, but it's very minor. Mostly by Jupiter and the  villain. The last thing is that there's some nudity. The villain yanks  Sailor Moon's brooch, which detransforms her... however, ribbons still fly  about to cover key areas, so don't worry.
You'll absolutely love this  video. The somewhat more adult aspect of it makes it even more enjoyable.  The laughs are endles... and not all are intentional. Many people find the  scouts' chanting of their names during their transformations very amusing  (Serrraaa Juptah!) and the cheesy British music during Moon Scepter  Elimination is to die for!

Har har! Take that Martha Stewart! Ha ha ha! It is funny! There is a certain part though, when it seems that the VCR just paused. It's just Usagi and her amazing talant for holding her breath for 18 seconds. It's just a wonderful movie, Love, Action, Comedy... What more could anyone ask for. There is a nifty introduction to all the characters and we get to see Mamoru's past. Yay! Just forget about not knowing Japanese, it sounds nifty and theres subtitles.

I recommend highly buying in japanese before someone like DiC dubs it in English and ruins some aspects of the story by changing how someone says something  (especially when Ami-chan suggests that Mamoru is popular with men!)

1232637,5,B00000JDIL,"Like the Disney films, the creators of Sailor Moon aim elements of their stories at both juvenile and adult audiences. But the extraordinary thing about Sailor Moon is that the characters and their relationships are so  well-drawn that meaningful exchanges can occur completely without words.  This movie (Sailor Moon R) has one of my favorite examples: Mamoru has been  kidnapped by a villain who threatens the world, and the other Sailor  Senshei are trying to persuade a reluctant Usagi (Sailor Moon) to lead them  into battle. Rei (Sailor Mars) simply puts her hand on Usagi's shoulder and  says, ""For Mamoru's sake, too."" And a little smile passes between  them. Why? Perhaps because, as fans of the series know, both girls have  been romantically involved with Mamoru. Disney was never this subtle.  Still, you don't HAVE to be a fan of the series to appreciate the love that  passes between the characters, or the spectacular finale (beautifully  animated) that are at the heart of Sailor Moon R. Sailor Moon and her  cohorts somehow manage to be both tough AND sensitive- a highly unusual  combination! I sent this video as a Christmas present to a fellow fan.  Personally, I think it would be a wonderful present for even an open-minded  non-fan.",943488000,5,1255,4.937799043062201

To those two lovely people out there who gave it two stars because they hate subtitles, I'd like to see  you watch that unbutchered- RAW!!!  As in Japanese seiyuu only!! This movie  rocks, go read some subtitles because Usagi's english voice is a disgrace  to the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.",933552000,,409,4.52054794520548

This movie, the Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon R Movie, was the first thing that brought me to the fact that the dub voices were horrifying. Since it is in subtitles,  there isn't much that Pioneer can do to wreck it. One small rant about the  movie itself, though. It's only about an hour long, and that's certainly  not enough! We want more Usagi and Mamoru!!!  :D",931478400,,414,4.554054054054054

If you like the SM videos (A star is born, scouts unite, etc...),  you have absolutely no idea of how good Sailor Moon series will get in the  next episodes!!! Even when the english versions (with the ""sailor  says"" crap) can't be compared to the original ones, you should buy  this movie and all the SM videos available.",930960000,,476,4.314606741573034

Sailor Moon R is a great example of these ideas, combined with its beautiful artwork, stunning computer  genereated/hand-drawn mix of animation, and poignant storyline, this movie  will please all who watch it, whether young or old.  Never preachy, or  boring, Sailor Moon is brought to a new level in this movie, a cinematic  delight. Children will be engaged by the energetic and non-violent action,  while adults will be amused and touched by the well-developed characters.

I have seen all the Sailor Moon movies in their uncut/Japanese non-subtitled  versions, and I think it is great that Pioneer is finally going to release  this movie to the USA and not DiC.  Although this isn't my absolute  favorite Sailor Moon movie out of the 3 that are available, it is very  cool.  I've watched it many many times over, and each time it just gets  better and better. :)  If you've only seen the DiC dubs that are available  in the US, wait until you see this movie, and then you'll REALLY see what  Sailor Moon is like.  Hearing it in its pure Japanese language form makes  it even better than any dub you'll get in the USA. :)",929664000,,790,4.18

Moon Revenge, the closing song, is surly the best song in the Sailor Moon series along with Power of Love. Sure it  has brief, very brief nudity, but hey! It's a cartoon!

7912147,4,B00000JDIL,"Note to Viz: Please, just a little less sharpness next time. You guys went a little too far in a good direction. Some of the scenes actually hurt to watch.
I'm very grateful to see the HD upgrade here, most of it looks great, but you overcompensated a bit in the process. I haven't watched the DVD yet to see if that is easier on my eyes.

This is my first time watching the series all the way through in order, and this is my first time watching this movie. Now, it's part of season R, but the original script wrote the characters very poorly in the beginning of the film. They didn't react where they normally would have, Usagi and Mamoru are very much a ""couple"", but Chibi Usa knows of their identities as Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask??? So it doesn't seem to have a direct tie-in at any particular part of the R series. It was still a very good and enjoyable movie overall, but it really should have been introduced more like it was an episode, and have everyone planning to go on this trip, or what even led up to the idea of going to this big garden, rather than just hey, they're all here on vacation randomly. But I digress. Once the story got started (which was pretty early on in the film), it stayed a great pace all the way until the end.

I can't imagine how the original English script might have censored the gay romance between Mamoru and Fiore. It was a big part of the movie, and the reason Usagi was so justifiably jealous over Fiore's showing up. It's the reason Fiore is driven to find Mamoru the most beautiful flower. I love that they gave Mamoru a gay love interest, I feel that it helps expand his character.

It comes with the DVD and Blu-Ray, and the case includes a slipcover with small holographic details. Mine came in excellent shape, and looks beautiful with my growing collection. I hope the next two movies include a theatrical release when they come out. I'm disappointed that I missed this one.",1526342400,,1930,4.370473537604457
7912148,5,B00000JDIL,"I have to say, with the re-release of the VIZ dub, I was skeptical about the animation quality.
