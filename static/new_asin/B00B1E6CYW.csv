8560703,4,B00B1E6CYW,This film documents Rhees effective yet shortlived leadership in the DC school system. I recommend it to those who are concerned with modern public education and the means by which we seek to meet those goals.,1452124800,,209,4.833333333333333
8560704,4,B00B1E6CYW,"The DVD begins with the background of unrealistic expectations set by NCLB - that every child will be proficient in English and math. Ms. Rhee becomes leader of the D.C. school system by virtue of her having some success as an inner-city Baltimore 2nd-grade teacher; however, the documentary waffled on just how much success she had and implied that it had been overstated. Ms. Rhee went on to additional accomplishments, primarily recruiting teachers for large school districts and advising Mr. Klein in N.Y.C. - however, none of that was included in the DVD.

D.C. schools could be summarized as weird - 8% of pupils were performing at grade level, while 95% of staff were rated as good or better. Early on Ms. Rhee found herself saddled with a dysfunctional and overstaffed central office - eg. the warehouse had boxes and boxes of supplies that hadn't made it to the classrooms, forcing teachers to buy out of their own pocket. Ms. Rhee pushed for authority to fire inept and unneeded personnel, and about 15% in the central office went. She also closed 20 schools due to low enrollment - over the loud objections of those in the community. Two-dozen principals were replaced - primarily for failing to maintain an orderly environment and boost pupil achievement. Some scenes showed the disorderly environment at Anacostia High - that interim principal was also replaced despite achieving promised academic gains; I have no idea how anyone could have achieved a proper environment there, and it certainly was far more demanding than the 2nd-grade environment Ms. Rhee came from.

First year results were impressive; questions about and a directive to investigate cheating, however, were not responded to. The same challenges occurred the second year - this time Rhee hired a firm to 'investigate,' though the DVD indicated that investigation was cursory.

Ms. Rhee was directed to reduce expenditures for summer-school between her 2nd and 3rd years, and blatantly refused to do so. This, along with the various controversies she caused, probably led to the City Council's president running for mayor, defeating the incumbent, and the end of Rhee's tenure. The DVD also reported that she hired too many new teachers (replacing those fired) and had to lay off additional staff to make up for this.

Third year test results continued to climb at problem schools. Noyes Elementary went from 44% at grade level in 2007 to 84% in 2009; a new principal saw and heard evidence of cheating (teachers changing test answers), but the subsequent investigation again was superficial and did not interview her. Other schools reported similar 'gains.' Principals at schools with sizable gains received $10,000 bonuses, vice-principals $9,000, and teachers $8,000. National tests (eg. the NAEP), however, showed little improvement. Finally, I would like to see another separate program investigating the purported gains from other so-called inner-city 'miracles' - eg. New York City (Joel Klein), Houston's 1.5% dropout rate (Rod Paige), as well as charter schools overall. My suspicion is that neither the liberal prescription (more money) nor the conservative (school choice, merit pay, etc.) work - what is needed is greater parental and community commitment to education, as well as more pupil effort (eg. the Asian approach).

Overall, the DVD presented the issues well, but failed to pursue the cheating issue far enough - such as done by USA Today; nor did it provide post-Rhee score data. The DVD also failed to detail the outlandish financial rewards handed out to wean teachers off tenure.",1366070400,3,3587,5.166953528399311
