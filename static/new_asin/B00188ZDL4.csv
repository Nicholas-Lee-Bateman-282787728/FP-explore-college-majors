An unexpected ending enhances the dramatic effect of the plot. A must see if you are into sexy, romantic, drama.",1326499200,,249,4.434782608695652
8268897,4,B00188ZDL4,"This is a good film as any would be with Natasha Henstridge in a starring role.  She is under-rated as an actress because men cannot see past her body.  However I thought she was very good in the romantic comedy, ""It Had To Be You"", in which she never takes her clothes off.",1305504000,2,274,4.150943396226415
8268898,1,B00188ZDL4,"I DECIDED TO BUY THIS BASED ON REVIEW IN IMDB.  I WAS WRONG.  WHAT YOU GET IS A ""PG"" VERSION AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS DVD TO MAKE IT ANY DIFFERENT THAN A PRIME TIME SHOW WE WATCH ON TV.  IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY TRYING TO GET THIS DVD.  I GOT RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON AND THE SELLER.",1284854400,6,314,3.626865671641791
