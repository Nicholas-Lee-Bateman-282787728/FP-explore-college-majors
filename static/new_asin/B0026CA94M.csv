8352503,4,B0026CA94M,"""Cheesecake"" is an unusual but fascinating film made in
Russia in 2008.

It stars Pavel Melenchuk as Alyosha, the troubled 13 year
old offspring of a dysfunctional and fragmented family.
Alyosha longs for a better life and when he is selected
to appear in a cheesecake commercial on TV with total
strangers acting as his mum and dad, he believes that his
life is about to change for the best. He developes a desire
to live with his cheesecake mum and dad as a real family
and his desire to do so becomes an obsession, so much so
that he loses his grip on reality.

Alyosha seeks out his cheesecake dad who is a doctor and a
single man and who comes home one evening to find the boy
sleeping outside his door.  He reluctantly allows the boy to
stay the night which eventually turns into a permanent
arrangement.

Alyosha is elated with his new friendship and living
arrangements and is determined to be accepted by keeping
the apartment clean and tidy, cooking the meals, doing the
shopping and being useful.

Alyosha wants his cheesecake mum and dad to be his real
parents but there are two people in the way. His cheesecake
mum has been married for years with a husband and his
cheesecake dad has a girlfriend who eventually shows up
again and creates problems for Alyosha. She insists that the
boy has to go.

Alyosha is cute, likeable and intelligent but very deadly
and he is prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve his
dream, even kill those in his way if he has to.

If you like foreign films then this is a good one to add
to your collection.",1305331200,4,1553,4.428070175438597
8352504,4,B0026CA94M,"I am not a film snob but why is it the best stories come from Europe? In the US, ""Frailty"" dealt with the issues of what is evil but the children themselves did not participate in true evil until adulthood. Cheesecake shows that, just as in ""Lord of the Flies"", evil is within all of us. The viewers follow our ""hero"" as he evolves from needy child, guilt ridden murderer, to full blown psychopath.

It was wonderful to watch.

It would be easy to say that the boy had emotional needs that were not being met by his family but that would be a cop out. Sure, the home life was the pits but what happens. . .

Get this movie. Despite the evil, you sort of cheer for the kid as he gets his way with the adults. At the end, as the adults come to the realization of what a monster the boy really is, the viewer will wonder if they will devise their own way of ridding themselves of an unwanted son?",1242345600,6,893,4.091428571428572
8352505,5,B0026CA94M,"This brilliant, chilling tale features no Hollywood ending and a strange plot that can only be made outside of the mainstream circle of indie producers.  This complex storyline begins with a cheesy look at a commercial about cheesecake.  As the camera pans across a brightly lit, cheery set we see three smiling faces eating cheesecake - apparently a family, who really like cheesecake!  Russian born Pavel Melenchuk stars as Alyosha, a boy from a 'questionable' family who was one of the stars in the commercial.  It seems as if Alyosha took the commercial a little too seriously and now that it is over, wants to relive it - for real this time.  How seriously can you take a commercial about cheesecake?  Well, Alyosha gets a little too close to his male co-star, Mikhail, a man who's real job is as a doctor.  Alyosha, who has no father and whose mother is an alcoholic, appears on Mikhail's doorstep one evening looking for a place to sleep.  Alyosha, who looks a little 'different' than when he was in the commercial, is rudely turned away by Mikhail, but it doesn't take Mikhail too long to have a change of heart and take the boy in - just for one night.

Mikhail awakens the next morning to find Alyosha gone, his bedding neatly folded, the dishes washed and the kitchen spotless.  Soon enough Alyosha finds his way back into Mikhail's life and the man begins to come out of his shell, taking in the boy and treating him like a son.  That is when everyone's life begins to change, one by one - whether they like it or not.  Creepy is certainly a way to describe this movie.  Think of the evil in The Good Son meets the obsession in Misery and you have the plotline of Cheesecake.",1239408000,7,1687,4.509868421052632
