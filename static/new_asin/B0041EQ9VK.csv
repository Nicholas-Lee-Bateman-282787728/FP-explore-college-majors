8412629,3,B0041EQ9VK,"This is a fairly decent Penthouse Video with nice style for the most part and somewhat explicit at least with the female nudity.  However this is a 1998 release, so there's definitely the characteristic frustrating editing, always lurking and ready to screw up any footage that shows the girl getting a little too wild.  Example: there's a fiery scene about 40 minutes in where even with the rather dark reddish lighting, you see some brief but close-up pulled open pink in several cuts.  However some of it has been cut and cross-cut to make sure the fingers stay in the way rather than just showing how it played out in a linear fashion (don't know why they have to constantly interfere like that).  Lots of slow motion combined with frequent cutting back and forth to different shots (that don't always keep a linear continuity, so items of clothing come off then back on then off again), absurdly long cross-fades where seconds tick by as two different cuts overlap so you can't really make out the detail of either one... it's the bizarre style we've become accustomed to with Penthouse releases - but never quite accept as a suitable example of true passionate yet teasing footage.  It comes off a bit contrived and therefore breaks the eroticism rather frequently.

This release has lots of different types of scenes - solo, girl-girl (with some touching but pretty tame overall and some ridiculous ""action"" that even a teenager would find silly and lacking in any meaningful contact), and even some boy-girl although you know that doesn't show anything explicit.  It runs about 50 minutes.  I'd say if you are collecting PH video when it still had some style to it, you can certainly do worse than this title but I'd recommend shopping for a reasonable price.",1426118400,,1767,4.808580858085809
8412630,2,B0041EQ9VK,"I was looking forward to this particular feature, especially being a huge fan of Julie Strain.  From the year 2000 onwards, Penthouse's video features have been starting to come a little closer to their magazine content, without trading sensuality, eroticism, and beauty for complete trash.  They usually feature some of the most beautiful girls in the business, and show you more than any Playboy feature would.  The same year to produce such winners as Dear Diary and Internet Babes also gave us Amazing Amazon Beauties. -great concept, beautiful women, but disappointing feature.  First off the picture quality of the DVD was substandard in comparison to most of Penthouse's features -not as bad as the terrible 1997 Paige Summers & Friends transfer-but bad enough.  Second, and most important, is the poor content.  Listed in 2000, this feature shows about as much skin as Fast Cars, Fantasy Women, or Ready to Ride -the only difference being that Julie Strain showed more in those features, which are close to ten years old.  Despite the occasional girl-girl kissing and nipple licking, this feature could have almost been a Playboy video.  Hell, Julie Strain has more exposure in any of her erotic thriller B-movies than in this.  Good concept, poor execution.  Go for Dear Diary, Internet Babes, or either of the Pets in Paradise features to experience Penthouse's best.",1041897600,8,1377,5.107142857142857
