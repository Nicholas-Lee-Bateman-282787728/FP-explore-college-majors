464984,1,6302450187,"Why would a couple with a baby and a small child hire a ""nanny"" to live with them without checking her out?

Peyton could not have had any references or anything at all to check
because she was never a nanny and she even used a fake name.
This couple obviously never even asked her for ID.

At their first meeting, Peyton said that she would leave a letter of reference on the table - - what happened with that?
Peyton said that she only worked with one family - -
maybe she was a nanny before she married Dr. Mott - -
but that still could not have been recent.

The couple were listed with an agency.
When Peyton admitted that she was not from the agency, that should have been the end of the conversation.

Why would this couple take this woman into their house?

However.....
I actually was on Peyton's side.
Peyton lived in a gorgeous house with a successful husband and was expecting her first baby.
Then, because of accusations which Peyton probably did not believe,
her husband committed suicide and then she lost her baby and had an emergency hysterectomy.
She was thrown out of her house and all of her money was frozen.
She said that she didn't have anyone to go to after the deaths of her husband and baby.
So, she was all alone, grieving, with no money and nowhere to live - -
she probably had no skills because she was a housewife so she couldn't get a job.
I felt for Peyton.",1502409600,,1389,4.286259541984733

465251,5,6302450187,"This is an excellent movie.  Watching it as a teenager I was riveted, and almost two decades later I still think it is a great movie with plenty of twists and turns.  I personally like the dated look of the clothing and dcor in the film and think it is a fun look at the early 90s.  All of the acting is top notch including the little girl in the movie.  It's a little weird seeing Julianne Moore in her smallish role, too.  I am glad I bought this DVD and have shared it with a bunch of my friends who also remember watching it when it was current.  It has held up much better than a lot of ""thriller"" flicks from that era.",1472428800,3,624,3.9919354838709675

465300,5,6302450187,"It is an interesting film with the theme of not everything is as it seems or never judge a book by its cover. Peyton, seemingly looking like a nice lady, is devious, dangerous, and downright frightening and Solomon, though slow due to learning disabilities, is immediately judged as a threat on not one but TWO occasions when he only has the best of intentions for the family. If anything, its much more than a thriller, its an examination on how we all should revisit our opinions of people well past first impressions.

465465,3,6302450187,"The idea was okay for a thriller. I wish there would've been some backstory about the nanny's personal life, I felt like I didn't know a thing about her. Her upbringing, hobbies, cares, there was nothing there which made for an odd transition to the plot.  Demorney did a fine job though as did Ernie Hudson. The nanny and husband relationship/flirting could've been amped up to really build the tension more. There needed to be a stronger actor for the hubby, he was pretty weak. Some of the pranks on the family were just mild surface stuff that never hit a homerun for me.",1448668800,,575,4.528846153846154

465772,4,6302450187,"I always have mixed feelings when it comes to a horrible nanny movie. I'm a nanny myself and have a hard time dealing with the fall out of movies like this. A common question I'm asked (though people seem to truly not understand that it's horribly rude) is if I'm sleeping with the husband. Most nannies aren't out to ""steal"" the husband. I consider the couple good friends, and while yes the husband is attractive, the mere thought never crossed my mind until the first time someone asked me. Still, I understand the appeal of these movies. I thoroughly enjoy this movie and did even before I became a nanny. I find all the characters sympathetic, even Peyton's, and I like that despite everything she does to pull them apart they band together and defeat her in the end. It's a pretty unrealistic movie, not that it's something I care too much about since it is after all just a movie. I just wish people didn't take it so seriously.",1428019200,,935,4.5058823529411764

However, I must agree with others who have discussed the implausible aspects of the film. One of the most obvious questions, for me, is why would a woman who doesn't have a job need a full time live-in nanny? Just so she could build a greenhouse in her back yard? Yeah, okay! Why would she hire a woman that looks younger and a million times better than she does? I guess one can only make assumptions. Nevertheless, it was an awesome movie that paved the way for the ""crazy babysitter/nanny"" movies. It is also arguable that Ernie Hudson was not believable as Solomon. I disagree!

466024,5,6302450187,"This movie is a psychological thriller that has you on the edge of your seat. It may be a bit predictable, but it keeps you guessing as to what act of terrifying revenge comes next. One family is very happy as their financial status does well, living in their beautiful home. The husband has a good professional job, his wife is expecting their second child, and their little girl is adorable. A perfect setting that delivers a loving family, who basically have what many people can only dream of.

As the wife goes to her regular GYN prenatal visit, she has a horrifying experience with her doctor, and discusses it with her husband. Her husband encourages her to report the incident, and after she does, several other women came forward as they told their stories. The GYN doctor committed suicide, and his pregnant wife losses everything financially, and her baby. She goes into a deep depression, then seeks revenge on the first woman, who reported the incident.

The woman who first reported the GYN incident delivers her newborn baby son, and she doesn't know it at the time, but she hires a live-in house-keeper, who is the GYN doctor's wife. The new house-keeper has big plans on her revenge mission as she terrifies one family. Her plans included killing one woman, stealing her husband, and raising two children that are not hers. However, nothing will stop her, from killing anyone who crosses her path, or attempts to destroy her evil mission.

This chilling, haunting movie grabs your attention immediately, and keeps it as each scene becomes more intense. The entire cast give an excellent acting performance as you enter a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. Entertaining from start to finish.

At the end, Claire flips because she found out Peyton was Dr. Mott's widow. So what? That could have been a coincidence. They only thought she was an evil person because she was Dr. Mott's widow.

466223,3,6302450187,"Okay, everyone has pretty much seen this movie. I saw it a long time ago, and wanted to see it again, but the library doesn't have it.

Some parts were so slow (the actor just standing there, or walking very slowly) that I had to fast-forward.

Now that I've seen it again, I have a few questions.

Did they have to make the handyman act SO retarded? It looked overdone.

Since when do they show the picture of and name the victim of sexual molestation on the tv news? Unless the victim is allowing it, which I don't think she would have. Of course, Peyton probably could have found out the name from her husband's attorneys, but she conveniently happened to see it on tv while she was in the hospital after her emergency hysterectomy.

Why did Marlene just have to rush immediately to the house with the info on Peyton? It couldn't have waited even a couple of hours?

Did the little girl Emma have to talk in SUCH a whiny voice?

Did Peyton never take any time off? Was she with them 24/7? She had no car? How did they pay her? How did she cash the checks if they were made out in her fake name? Why did Emma ride the bus to school when it was so easy for Peyton to just walk there?

Why was Peyton so crazy? What happened in her childhood and why did she say her husband ""took care of her?"" Why did she think it was okay for him to molest his patients, as long as it didn't affect her?

I think they made Rebecca DeMornay look pasty and unappealing, so why were all the guys so nuts about her looks?

But overall, it's a good thriller - although I think it would have been better if Peyton had suffered more.",1371427200,4,1611,4.167741935483871

Annabella Sciorra's character Claire Bartel reminded me of all the mistakes I wouldn't make just to get extra help around the house. Her longing for assistance killed her best friend, almost destroyed her marriage and nearly took her out. Let's shift to De Mornay's performance as the manipulative nanny. She set a trap for Claire and she fell straight into it. The only character I sympathized with was Marlene Craven. She was stupid for confronting Peyton after finding out the truth about the bitch.

The Bartels already have a daughter Emma (Madeline Zima) and Claire's husband Michael (Matt McCoy) persuades Claire to make a formal complaint. When she complains to the local Medical Board, four more women come forward with the same accusation. As a result, Mott commits suicide. Mott's wife (Rebecca de Mornay) is also pregnant but as a result of the stress loses her baby. As there are damages claims against Mott's estate, she also loses her luxury home. She then assumes the name Peyton Flanders and goes to work for the Bartels as a nanny, looking after Claire's baby. From here on the story is rather predictable. Peyton does everything she can to make Claire's life unpleasant - feeding her baby with her own breast milk so that it rejects Claire's; trying to seduce Michael and claiming he is having an affair with one of their close friends, Marlene Craven (Julianne Moore).

466287,3,6302450187,"The same year that `Single White Female' was released, this variant of the genre featuring Rebecca De Mornay in a `Fatal Attraction' type role came bursting into theaters.  It is very dated, feels more 80's than 90's and flatlines with a completely phoned in lead performance, and yet it is all so very entertaining.

The film tells the story of two young women affected tremendously by the malpractice of a gynecologist.  Claire Bartel is pregnant with her second child when her doctor molests her.  Her complaint against him causes him to commit suicide and the stress causes his pregnant wife to have a miscarriage.  So, the scorned widow dons a new name (Peyton Flanders) and squeezes herself into Claire's life when she applies to be their nanny.  She sets her plan into motion in order to take over Claire's life, which means breastfeeding her son and gaining her daughter's love and devotion and even trying to advance on her husband by forming cracks in their marriage.  She is nearly effective, but her plans are soured by the strength of Claire's devotion to her family.

It is scary in scenes and works as a whole to produce an entertaining scenario.  That said, the finale is a tad over-reaching and De Mornay's performance is so skeletal (seriously, why is she acting like a teenager?) that it takes away from the impact of the film.  Matt McCoy turns in a TERRIBLE performance and Sciorra just feels disheveled the whole time (and her asthmatic episodes feel very put on) but Julianne Moore is fantastic in her small role and Madeline Zima turns out a fantastic child performance.  I found the film very predictable, right down to the insightful mentally handicapped man who was predestined to become the family's savior the moment he appeared onscreen.

I find the thriller The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) a great movie.  I saw it in the theater back in 1992 and was surprised by how good it was.  It stars Rebecca DeMornay, Annabella Sciorra, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson, Madeline Zima, and Julianne Moore.  When I think of Rebecca DeMornay, I think her playing the role of Mrs. Mott in this movie.  She did a fantastic job as the nut case nanny.

My favorite character in the movie is the aggressive, busy body Marlene, played by Julianne Moore.  My favorite line of the movie is when Marlene says, ""Figure it out.  You've got a Harvard education"".  Some of the scenes are flat out unbelievable and laugh-out-loud funny, such as when Claire and Michael take back the bike they gave to Solomon (played by Ernie Hudson) as a gift.

Overall, this is a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend it.",1345766400,,991,4.444444444444445

466371,5,6302450187,"I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers.  This film is one that I've just encountered.  The story is riveting from start to finish.  Exploring the universal theme of revenge, this movie depicts the harrowing quest of a family struggling to survive against an insidious yet ruthless evil.

Clare is embroilled in a dilemma.  She believes that she has suffered molestation during a routine exam given by her gynocologist.  After Clare reports the doctor to the police, several other women come forward to report simelar allegations.  Dr. Mott cannot withstand the devastation to his practice and commits suicide.  The doctor's mentally unhinged wife systematically plots her revenge against Clare and her family.  Posing as a nanny named Payton Flanders, Mrs. Mott gains ascendancy over the family through her kind facade.  Gradually, Clare begins to suspect that things are not what they seem.

I found this story to be very compelling.  My favorite aspect was the psychological mind games instigated by the character of Mrs. Mott.  We see that evil systematically erodes trust of others before it pursues the outright disstruction of its prey.  I love the heroic actions of Clare, and the other individuals in the family are very endearing.

The acting in this film is superb.  Rebecca Da Mornay is chilling as the psychotic caregiver.  She brings a malevolence yet oddly empathetic portrayal to a role that could have easily degenerated into campy material.  The woman portraying Clare is excellent, and the little girl who plays the young daughter is great.  I also love the man who portrays Solomon, a mentally challenged yet wise gardener and fix-it man.  This movie is one that should be watched for entertainment and for a stunning portrait of the universal struggle of good and evil.  God bless you all.",1337212800,5,1813,5.0574324324324325

466414,4,6302450187,"It's interesting to revisit ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" after all these years.  It was a surprise blockbuster when it was released almost 12 years ago.  It represented one of the first films of the ""fill-in-the-blank from Hell"" movies, an ouevre which included ""Unlawful Entry"" (the cop from hell), ""Pacific Heights"" (the tenant from hell), and ""Consenting Adults"" (the next door neighbor from hell).  Out of that context all these years later, the film still resonates as a tale of suburban terror...as we still raise an eyebrow at those who watch over our children...who they are, where did they come from, etc.  It tells the story of a young mother, Claire Bartell (a sympathetic Annabella Sciorra) who is molested by her OB-GYN during a pregnancy exam(the film's most stomach-turning moment).  She comes forward and reports him, prompting others to do the same, and the good doctor kills himself.  His wife, Peyton Mott (Rebecca DeMornay) discovers all of her husband's assets and funds are frozen due to the pending lawsuits, and she loses it all, including having a miscarraige and having complications which lead to a hysterectomy.  Consumed by rage and vengeance, she learns Claire was the first to come forward (thus compelling many other women too as well) and she answers her ad for a nanny to her young daughter and her newborn son.  Peyton manipulates things such that she appears the ideal, kindly, and warm candidate.  Many have criticized the movie that the Bartells should have checked her out more, although this is never addressed.  Peyton offers references, whom I assume are people she has paid to sing her praises (that's just my theory).  In the meantime, Peyton earns their trust and seeks to rip the family apart from the inside by doing everything from trying to seduce Claire's husband, played by a frsutrating Matta McCoy.  I understand he is supposed to be a ""sensitive"" husband, but what a wuss!  Turning her friends against her, Julianne Moore in one of her first major roles (she is terrific, of course).  She frames the MR handyman, Solomon (played by a brilliant Ernie Hudson) for possibly molesting Claire's daughter.  All of this escalates into murder and carnage, as the film has one of the more memorable and chilling finales in this genre.

The film is the directing debut of Curtis Hanson, who went on to direct hits such as ""The River Wild"", ""Wonder Boys"", and the brilliant ""L.A. Confidential.""  Hanson brings more class and excitement to the film than it probably deserves.  The film is well cast with Sciorra, McCoy, Moore, and Hudson, but the film belongs to DeMornay, who breaks away from her type cast as the sexpot angenue.  She deftly moves from Peyton being warm and soft-spoken to menace oozing from overy pore.  Look at the scene where she flips out privately in the bathroom...DeMornay shows us the extent of Peyton's rage and the effirt it takes for her to contain it.  DeMornay terrified audiences  as she convincingly plays Peyton's psychosis of wanting to assume the matriarchal helm of the Bartell home.  She terrified women especially, and the film become a pop phenomenon and families began doing much more extensive background checks on their nannies and their babysitters...a trend which was reported in the news at the time by agencies that provide these background checks.

In the end, ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" is a skillful suspense thriller.  While many of the twists are easily anticipated, it's DeMornays tour-de-force performance (which deserved some awards season attention) that takes the film the rest of the way and helped create a film which will remain a pop phenomenon for years to come.  I still hear the film referenced when people discuss their childcare providers.  For a film of this age, that's quite an achievement, and proves that it will remain a timeless story of domestic fear and paranoia.",1319760000,2,3890,4.962962962962963

466422,4,6302450187,"The acting, directing, and writing are superb, especially De Mornay's performance of vengeful malevolence as the character Payton . I've never seen her act this well. The story becomes scarrier by the moment, and you keep wondering what she will do next to destroy Claire (Annabella Sciorra), the person she turns her revenge on for causing her husband to commit suicide and herself to miscarriage from the shock. The suspense keeps escalating. The writer has deftly planted the clues that will enable annabelle to finally figure out that her nanny (De Mornay)is the personification of pure evil.

I would have given this film five stars if the writer had established a believable background for Peyton so that Claire and her husband Michael would have had a solid basis for hiring her as a nanny for their young daughter and the coming baby. No matter how charming a nanny is, anyone who reads and watches the news, or views some of the Dateline and CBS news mysteries, knows that first impressions can often be misleading. 99.9% of  persons would have asked Peyton for some checkable references--people who could vouch for her character and ability to care for children--and then checked them. But this was not done, setting the rest of the story on an unbelievable foundation. The writer should have had Peyton establish some kind of a reputation--even if done with a false resume and false letters of reccomendation and a few sympathetic friends to back her up.

Notwithstanding, I highly reccommend this thriller.",1244937600,,1518,4.992094861660079
466443,5,6302450187,"""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" first hit theatres in January, 1992 and was immediately a boxoffice hit, staying at #1 for over two weeks. It was one of those Hollywood films that made people talk about how important it was for people to do a thorough investigation of nanny's when it came time to hire those to care for one's child.
 The movie is about a young couple living in Seattle who hire a woman to be the caregiver for their little girl Emma and their new-born son Joe. Rebecca DeMornay, best known for playing a prostitute in the Tom Cruise flick ""Risky Business"", became a movie star in ""The Hand That Rocks That Cradle"". DeMornay plays a crazed woman seeking revenge on the mother who she works for, as she blames her for the death of her husband who committed suicide. Peyton, the DeMornay character, is one of the most vicious villins in movie history, as she makes life a living hell for the family that entrusts her with their lives and their home.
 This is s first-rate thriller and the ending is one of the best. The DVD is pretty much barebones, but it does come with the trailer. Look for Ernie Hudson who plays a small role in the movie as a mentally challenged handy man. Hudson would gain fame as the prison warden in HBO's ""Oz"" in 1997.",1241395200,,1261,4.407725321888412

466445,5,6302450187,"In this classic psycho-thriller, an impossibly beautiful Rebecca De Mornay pursues an ingenious plan of revenge.  After her doctor husband commits suicide after being accused of sexually abusing a patient, his gorgeous wife (De Mornay) plots revenge.  Without revealing her true identity, she obtains the job of live-in nanny to the family the mother of which was the primary accuser.  More would be telling.  This is a great thriller.

The tension in this film never lets up, and there are tensions of all kinds.  There is sexual tension, because the live-in nanny (De Mornay) is incredibly gorgeous, and you just have to wonder about a wife who would allow another woman this beautiful to live in her home, and hang around her husband that way.  (Quite a thought, actually.)  Plus, the viewer never has any doubt about De Mornay's evil intentions, although there is doubt about whether she is coolly plotting revenge, whether she is truly psycho, or both.  I won't tell.

This is a disturbing and tense film that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout.  Rebecca De Mornay is absolutely awesome in this film, and the supporting cast is superb as well.  Highly recommended.",1229126400,,1174,4.964102564102564

466449,5,6302450187,"This was the best pyschotic movie ever! Rebecca DeMornay is so secretly evil and mentally disturbed yet all throughout the movie she sure does a great job of hiding it and putting on a sweet,innocent facade until the truth is finally revealed about who she really is from the help of Claire Bartel's best friend, Marlene Craving, who, unfortunately dies at hands of Peyton's dirtywork which was originally intended for Claire to face. As the movie goes on it gets creepier and more terrifying, especially towards the end of the movie, when Peyton pretends she has left yet is devilishly hiding in the house ready to kill both Michael and Claire after now feeling betrayed by both of them. The most chilling and cruel scene is the part where Peyton realizes that Clair has an ""Achilles Heal""...ASTHMA...and she tries tries to kill Claire by stealing her asthma inhalers and pumping the medicine out of all of them, nearly killing Claire when she suffers an asthma attack seeing Marlene lying dead in the greenhouse and can't find an inhaler that works until it is too late and she collapses on the porch from lack of oxygen nearly dying until luckily help arrives and Claire is finally revived and ok. That scene to me was the cruelest playing on a person's weak point like that. But I guess that a crazy person will by any means do whatever it takes to get rid of someone they really resent and seek revenge upon without feeling any remorse about it as Peyton clearly showed. The other scene that was the cruelest was the scene where Peyton and Claire are fighting and Claire suddenly has an asthma attack while they are fighting and Peyton just looks down at the wheezing Claire,smiling, and saracastically asks,""Something the matter,Claire?"" And then as Claire is wheezing to death Peyton bends down and whispers to Claire that she now has total control of the family. But,fortunately, to our surprise, Claire somehow becomes strong and in a rage pushes Peyton out the window ending her and dirtywork for good. What is sweet is how then Claire is ok and realizes that she can trust Solomon with her family and let's him carry baby Joey downstairs as she goes to get help for poor Michael whom was left paralyzed by Peyton in the basement because he had betrayed her by being faithful to wife Claire and admitting this to her. Wow, did Peyton take Michael by surprise in that scene hitting him with the shovel sending him flying over the steps back down on the basement floor paralyzed and smashing the lightbulb leaving him in the dark. I give this movie 5 stars because the Peyton Flanders character is one of the most evil and psychotic characters to ever chill a movie screen and its audience.

466451,4,6302450187,"A tale of revenge and madness in white picket-fence America, exquisitely crafted and paced with excellent acting by Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay, and especially Ernie Hudson as 'Solomon.' With its getting-closer-to-the-edge-of-your-seat escalation of menace, this film is not for the squeamish but is refreshing for its constraint from using too much graphic violence (despite the 'R' rating for intensity and adult themes). Well-integrated, unique situations you don't see every day in this genre, plus genuinely scary surprises keep it from slipping into stock mode or mean spiritedness...Veteran soundtrack composer Graeme Revell's musical score compliments the mood and action extremely well but visual DVD transfer appears less than perfect; too bad, because it's an otherwise good-looking film with rich colors and appealing locations.

466514,4,6302450187,"THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE was one of the most popular edge-of-your-seat thrillers of the 1990s.  It taps into the suburban nightmare of a deranged nanny who tries to 'steal' a family.

Young housewife Claire Bartel (played by Annabella Sciorra) is thrust into a nightmare situation when her new doctor's medical procedures border on indecent assault.  She files a complaint, and opens the way for other women to speak up about his malpractice.  Shortly before he's due in court to explain his actions, he commits suicide, and Claire resumes her life.

Enter Peyton Flanders (played with chilling conviction by Rebecca DeMornay).  She's a young nanny with no job, and Claire's busy raising two small children whilst building a new greenhouse.  The situation couldn't be more perfect...or more sinister.  While Peyton worms her way into the Bartel household, she hides a secret plan of revenge to bump Claire out of the family portrait for good!

Sciorra and DeMornay duke it out in grand style in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, which features enough sickening suspense and fabulous thrills to hook even the most remote audience.  Co-starring Matt McCoy, Madeline Zima (TV's ""The Nanny""), Ernie Hudson (TV's ""Oz""), and Julianne Moore (""The Hours"", ""Far from Heaven"").

I think there could have been done a lot more with this film, but it ended up becoming as flat as a Lifetime movie.

So it has all right cast and an interesting enough storyline- but the way it is played out leaves a stale impression that doesn't make me desire to see it ever again. I wouldn't recommend it honestly. There are much better suspense films out there.

3/5",1169683200,3,537,4.254901960784314
466518,3,6302450187,"There were many facets of the film which made me ask ""Would that happen today?"" Peyton showed up and was I guess more or less hired on the spot. Most folks would presumably say ""Well, we'll discuss your resume and prior experience and get back to you with our final decision.."" yet we see Peyton Flanders (Mrs Mott) hired right away. I think most Americans would have just hired a Mexican gal, probably at half the salary paid to Peyton. Perhaps Peyton's character today could have been a Hispanic woman (the gorgeous Eva Longoria comes to mind) who merely pretended to be illegal.

 Not ever having hired a nanny I assume that a full-blown criminal background check would be done just as it is for day care staff or school bus drivers/cafeteria workers/custodians.

When Peyton (Mrs Mott) is in the hospital after her miscarriage and total hysterectomy she looks up to see the woman who initiated the complaint against her late husband. I don't think today accusers have their image in the news (think of the Kobe Bryant rape case) so Peyton would not have seen the woman she blamed for the suicide of Dr Mott. The story line doesnt reveal much about how much Peyton loved her late husband. It might have made the character more interesting to have this miscarriage not be her first. Late in the film--as Claire sees the nursery room of Peyton's now repossessed home-- we learn that even after her miscarriage and hysterectomy Peyton evidently continued pumping her breasts to ""keep her milk up"". It might have made for more realism if there could have been a scene with Peyton showing up with a leak on her blouse, or perhaps Claire could have found a breast pad among Peyton's personal affects.

A gynecologist or endocrinologist would have to confirm whether a woman who underwent complete hysterectomy would even be able to lactate that many months post operatively.

 The scene wherein we see Peyton wake up at 3am and quietly sneak into baby Joel's nursery room was perhaps the most emotional. When Peyton first picks up the pillow from the rocker you envision her suffocating the infant (and perhaps letting the grieving family believe it was from SIDS) instead she does what seems to be an outwardly loving act, straight out of a La Leche League PSA! Its only as the film progresses and we see Peyton's manipulation of Emma that the breast-feeding is seen as a way to subvert the infant's bond with his real mother. A backseat breast feed is inferred from the scene where Claire is franticly searching the contents of her purse for Michael's grant proposal. Claire is of course later concerned when her baby isn't nursing as often or as long as previously.

Ernie Hudson's innocent handyman is the only one capable of seeing the evil behind Peyton's charade. The tension between Peyton and Solomon could have easily been mined for more intrigue, and we aren't clear as to why Solomon didn't reveal Peyton's nursing Claire's son. Or why for that matter didn't Peyton drape herself during the daytime. A better script could have had Solomon bring the matter to the Bartell's attention only to have Peyton's false version of events discredit Solomon in the eyes of his friends.

It does strain credulity to see Claire so clueless up until the end of the film when suddenly she has enlightenment and she correctly identifies the threat posed by Peyton.",1168041600,3,3357,4.785837651122625
466519,5,6302450187,I liked this movie.  It has plenty of suspense and a pretty good plot.  DeMornay plays a wicked villian.  Annabella Sciorra does a half decent job of simulating an asthma attack.  I recommend for anyone looking for an entertaining drama/thriller.,1151971200,,246,5.075
466520,4,6302450187,"In 1992, when the movie was released to theaters, I was pleasantly surprised by a thriller that was filmed nearly entirely in the daytime with very little happening during darkness or rain. There were no tricks here, as there have been in so many similar films. This was the real thing, and you know that the directors and producers had that in mind. If they didn't, well, they were just lucky - but that's not likely.

Watching it again tonight, fourteen years later, I did find some flaws in a film that I recall adoring. They were slight flaws, however. The biggest of these was the elaborate trap that De Mornay's character set for Claire in the greenhouse. Seriously - any incompetent police officer (well before any detective would have arrived) would have seen the delicate apparatus that caused the glass to fall, or at least put one and one together upon finding bits and pieces of the apparatus. When I first saw the film, I thought that was a remarkable scene. Fourteen years later, and fourteen years older, I found it unrealistic. And realism in art (movies, books, etc.) is essential. If it's not realistic, it's impossible to believe.

Even the setup for the ""greenhouse attack"" was a bit off. It encompassed Claire's husband Mike having a first love, Marlene, and he spent an evening with her having cocktails and smoking a few cigarettes. Perhaps actors/producers/directors all smoke and so don't quite get the dichotomy here. You smoke, you stink. You're in a bar with smoke, you stink. If you're not, you don't. That's the dichotomy. If Michael returned from the bar he was at, Marlene would have known it three seconds after he entered their bedroom (where she was reading). The cig smoke, from him, Marlene, and other patrons of the bar, would have caused his clothing to absolutely REEK, which is all the more noticeable to a person that's been in a smoke-free bedroom for several hours. Claire would have realized it. If by some remarkable coincidence she did not, then the second he kissed her - bingo. Somehow that was overlooked. To some it may be a small oversight. To me, it was significant. Not significant enough to take away from the pleasure of the film, but enough so that I shook my head thinking, ""Stupid, stupid, stupid.""

There were too many coincidences in this film to make it great. But there was one terrific thing that will forever endear me to it: no black cats, no typical nonsense thriller crud (until the end, but it was minimal), filmed almost entirely in daylight (a terrific feat) and no...well, I can't say this, or it would be a spoiler.",1150934400,4,2588,4.721238938053097
466521,5,6302450187,"Startlingly effective and bewildering, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE uses a variety of Seattle and Tacoma locations to great effect.  Though isn't that the arboretum from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park standing in for Claire's workplace?  We saw this when it first came out, and viewing it again you get sucked right back in, due to a potent combination of fine writing, horrid yet efficient writing, and a handful of strong performances.  Little Madeline Zima puts our present day diva, Dakota Fanning to shame, with some quiet, subtle work worthy of the juvenile Oscar--if only the Academy still issued them!  Whatever happened to Madeline Zima?  She must be 21 by now, I wonder if she's still working or did the trauma of working with Rebecca de Mornay drive her away from acting?  With her big eyes and timid smile, Zima is outstanding as a child trapped in a manipulative relationship with a psychopathic nanny (Rebecca de Mornay).  We see how easily Peyton, the nanny, is able to deflect the little girl's love away from her real mother, just by pushing the right buttons.

What to make of the Ernie Hudson character?  Hudson is absolutely terrific, and has never again been used so well, but the whole ""black retarded friend who adores the white family"" thing leaves a bad taste in the viewers' mouth.  I don't really care for being politically correct, but the scene where the Bartel family gives him a new bicycle might well have been considered old hat even in the heyday of DW Griffith.  At the end of the movie I wanted him to stand back and let Peyton destroy Annabella Sciorra, that would have served her right.

The music scoring I found very beautiful.  The composer managed to find exactly the right aria, Arthur Sullivan's ""Poor Wand'ring One"" (from THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE) to express something of Peyton's fragile mental state--and to let us discover that, beneath the malice, trembles a frightened and abandoned soul.  Claire keeps playing this track over and over as though unaware that a real-life ""wandring one"" was under her roof.  Later, at the very end, this music is used to underscore Ernie Hudson's last scene.  You almost feel that the music knows more about the solitary and the traumatic than the director ever dreamed of.

Julianne Moore looks like an anorexic in her exquisite, chic and expensive outfits.  I wonder why the screenwriters didn't think of a plot in which she and Matt McCoy ARE actually having an affair, which Peyton finds out about and uses against them?  As it stands the story rests on a mass of unconvincing coincidences.  How on earth could Peyton arrange it so that Claire and Julianne Moore would go out on a girl date together on the very afternoon of the evening in which Moore and McCoy are planning a surprise birthday party?  But without that, there's no way her plot could have worked.  Oh well!  And as another reviewer has noted, Annabella Sciorrs, dimwitted throughout the whole first part of the movie, has a brilliant flash of deduction at the end which makes hash out of her characterization.  Visiting Dr. Mott's house, she does more than put two and two together--she puts one together.  Then she races home and slaps Rebecca De Mornay across the floor.

Annabella Sciorra, meanwhile, a lady with a knockout smile if I ever saw one,  also is good to watch and plays a good woman who is married to a good man (Matt McCoy) - wow, there's an oddity in modern films: a happy and faithful husband and wife!

This is an involving film. Once you are into it, you're hooked and the 100-plus minutes go by pretty fast. DeMornay is so effective in her role you just can't wait to see her exposed for who she is and justice done to her.

This causes DeMornay to lose her unborn baby. DeMornay gets herself hired as the nanny of a new baby her husband provided prenatal care for (the first woman to come forward). Her intentions are to take over Sciorra's (the mother of the new baby) children and husband. An excellent movie that I enjoy each time I watch. I always secretly wish that the movie had ended differently.

466605,4,6302450187,"The ethereal, beautiful, and always just a little too frightening Rebecca DeMornay does a star turn in this overly predictable potboiler about a psychotic Nanny run amok.

In THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, DeMornay plays Peyton, the widow of a Seattle-area gynecologist who commits suicide after he is accused by a patient (Annabella Sciorra) of sexual impropriety during an examination.

After losing her own pregnancy as a result of the shock of her husband's death, DeMornay manages to get hired by Sciorra to be the live-in Nanny for Sciorra's newly-arrived baby. As soon as Peyton settles in, she begins the slow and deliberate seduction and destruction of Sciorra's family, with the ultimate goal of stealing both husband and children away from the woman she considers responsible for the destruction of her own life.

Peyton is, ironically, a somewhat sympathetic character, who seems more dynamic than Sciorra's mousy Claire, at least until she starts to spit venom as her carefully constructed fantasy world begins to collapse.

The best thing about THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE is DeMornay herself, who moves from shyness and gentleness to brazenness and cruelty with an ease that is really disturbing. DeMornay is not a great actress, but she always projects an underlying predatory sexuality that THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE exploits magnificently.

When DeMornay's Peyton finally takes leave of her senses she is absolutely, convincingly, terrifying.

In 1976, Billie Whitelaw once again gave live-in caretakers a bad name as Ms. Baylock in ""The Omen.""

The story, although repeatedly criticized for it's predictability (so what?!) follow the maternity of Claire Bartel (Sciorra) who files a lawsuit--followed by four other clients--against her malpracticing obstertrician Dr. Mott(de Lancie), after some proding from husband McCoy. Sensing the end of his profession, the breast-happy doctor kills himself with a pistol. Unbeknownst to Claire, Dr. Mott has a pregnant and emotionally insecure (understatment?) wife (an ever empathetic De Mornay) who, following her husband's suicide loses the child due to complications during birth and undergoes a hysterectomy.

Six months later, Claire has had her child and is in need of a nanny for her newborn and daughter (Madeline Zima) while she tinkers with her new greenhouse. Enter placid-faced De Mornay as Peyton Flanders, the answer to Claire's prayers, and let the bloody payback begin.

De Mornay delivers a earth-shattering performance as the nanny from Hell, Sciorra in an inferior role portrays the asthmatic mother who's losing her family to the help, and McCoy is a nice extra as the father who hasn't got a clue until it's too late. Julianne Moore, in one of her first big breaks plays Scoirra's ill-fated (yes, it's gory) sister-in-law AND old flame of her own hubby. Hudson plays the mentally-challenged African-American handyman and hero, Solomon, who falls victim to the nanny's dirtywork. A well-rounded cast makes ""Cradle"" a treat for stalker/killer flick fans as well as those with a taste for substancial Hollywood thrillers.

Graeme Revell's score punctuates an occasionally slow-paced plot and accentuates on the thematic elements, while still giving the leads--particularly the nanny--good prescence and feeling. Special effects and stunts aren't the main emphasis, but the demise of Julianne Moore's nosy sister-in-law in the greenhouse is an unforgettable bloodbath that'll make you think twice about the way you position skylights.

Crowd-pleasing ending could've been better, but one supposes is the justified (and ultra-typical) way to end the Hollywood horror film. Good-guys win, bad-girl loses, cue the light-hearted music and roll credits. Deja vu? You betcha!

Her previous film credits include THE HARD WAY and CADILLAC MAN. She had a great role in the latter film. In this film,Sciorra is Claire Bartel who is searching for a nanny for her toddler daughter and her(Claire's) infant son. The hired nanny is Peyton Flanders(Rebecca DeMornay) who ends up trying to kill the baby. Peyton is the widow of Claire's physician Dr. Victor Mott. Peyton told Claire when they first met,that Peyton was once pregnant and miscarried around the time Dr. Mott was murdered. That scared her from having more children of her own. Before working for Claire and her engineer husband Michael(Matt McCoy),Peyton worked with one family who will be moving away and she didn't know where she'd go from there. Peyton overheard a conversation amongst a group of mommies,with one of them saying Claire needed a nanny. Ernie Hudson is Solomon,a black maintenance man who is good handling the baby also. Claire accused Dr. Mott of molesting her shortly before his murder. That's another reason why Peyton came along,seeking revenge. Peyton even releases the contents of Claire's breath machine(Claire suffers from asthma). The not-yet-famous Julianne Moore is Marlene Craven,a friend of the Bartels and an ex-girlfriend of Michael's.  Marlene goes out of her way to convince Claire that Peyton is ""poison"". Marlene ends up killed also,by falling window pane glass from the Bartels' greenhouse. There were points sharp enough to fatally stab. There was a scene in the 1990 film GHOST just like that.

466609,3,6302450187,"I seem to be watching a lot of my mum's movies at the moment (first Disclosure, now this), as to be honest, I'm getting a little bored with my DVDs. I need some fresh blood. Which isn't easy when you're limiting yourself to one DVD a week. So instead, I'll just dig around in my mum's DVD case.

I've seen this movie a million and one times now, and I never get fed up of it. There aren't many well known actors, apart from Rebecca De Mornay, Ernie Hudson and Julianne Moore in a truly bitchy role. Madeline Zima also appears in a very annoying role - when her mother tells her to stay put, does she? Does she hell! She just has to get involved! I didn't recognise many of the actors in this, although they all did a fantastic job, especially Annabella Sciorra, who plays the part of an asthmatic mother (although, she doesn't catch on to the fact that all her inhalers stop working at the same time)

Rebecca De Mornay & Ernie Hudson do brilliantly in this, as the psychotic nanny, and the mentally ill handyman respectively. Rebecca works the icy cold stare to the maximum, and almost looks evil towards the end of the movie, although she does sometimes have a certain childlike quality to her. Ernie is the only one to catch onto what she's really trying to do, although I do find her breastfeeding another woman's baby a little freaky. The movie shows a sensitivity to those with mental disabilities and doesn't exploit the mental illness simply for entertainment.

Julianne Moore, in one of her first roles, looking surprisingly young, is a true saracastic little bitch in this, and I wish she'd had more screen time, as she was terrific. She also cottons on to the fact that Peyton the psychotic nanny isn't quite right.

The whole film is brilliantly, although I can imagine some people not watching it, due to there being no ""big name stars"" in it. Well, no A-list celebrities in it. But if you see it cheaply, it's well worth watching, so go and abuse your credit card.",1092960000,3,1978,4.5013927576601676
466610,5,6302450187,"""The hand that rocks the cradle"" from 1992 and by Hollywood pictures was a great movie. i remembered it did create a buzz when it came out. the performances were good, but what really got it attention was this vile and almost mesmerizing character of peyton flanders (rebecca mornay). an over the edge psycho who wants to get revenge on one family because of a miscarriage she suffered over the fact that her husband , dr. mott (john de lancie) has been found guilty of sexually foundling his own patients.
Of course dr. mott has dr. mott has had a long history of doing this and his wife knows about it. however his dark secret is exposed by claire bartel (annabella sciorra) who while pregnant gets some unwanted sexually advances by the good old dr.
Bartel then is pointed as the first woman to come out as one of the dr. victim's and this causes a domino effect where other victims come of the closet to talk about the dr. the dr's games are over , however he can't deal with the fact that he has been exposed and going to prison, so he commits suicide (via a gunshot).
Peyton (mornay) loses their baby in the process and when she finds out miss bartel was the first victim to speak out she does what any typical psycho would do, she targets her for her revenge. the expression ""hell on wheels"" definitely applies here.  Peyton's character is quite a sight for sore eyes, i haven't seen a psychotic character like this since glenn close's alex character in fatal attraction.
However, peyton doesn't launch an obvious assault on claire. no she's schemes to get into the family and then killing clare by posing as a nanny for hire in the family.
She then sets up the situation to get hired by making it look like the baby of the Bartel's is choking and thus saving her life. Pathetic. However the Bartels, Clare and Michael (Matt Mccoy) laughingly fall for the lies of Peyton despite the fact that she isn't whom she claims to be but then again the Bartel family is such a naive family that they are easily pluckings for Peyton's revenge.
For instance, Peyton is hired to be the ""nanny"" even though, she admits she wasn't sent by a nanny agency , she doesn't have clear cut references, and Marlena Craven (Clare's friend) doesn't like her one bit.
That about sums the movie itself in a way. It seems several characters are either too dumb or too naive to see what's going and this in turn leads to the disastrous things that happen at the hands of Peyton.
For example it seems that Clare has a sort of asthma problem and she must take her pills. Well one day, Michael (Matt Mccoy) must turn in an important proposal to his company. Clare volunteers to do it, but when her back is turned, Peyton hides the proposal thus ensuring some problems in the marriage of the Bartels. The stress caused on Clare causes her to have several asthma attacks yet she doesn't see that Peyton is responsible despite the warnings from Marlena or the obvious advances Peyton is making toward Michael. Yes that's right Peyton ever the home-wrecker tries to make sexual advances toward this gullible guy to break up the family.
Add further insult the other person who doesn't believe Peyton's nanny character is who she claims is Solomon (Ernie Hudson from Ghostbusters and Oz). Solomon is a black man who is mentally challenged, yet despite this Solomon has the intelligence to realize Peyton is a psycho. However, Peyton before Solomon has a chance to discuss his suspicions of her, gets rid of Solomon, thus leaving the Bartel family once again an easy target for her.
LOL I made it sound like a soap opera. But all kidding aside ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" is a very intense psychological thriller. Probably the best that came after Fatal Attraction and was then followed by another thriller about a psycho woman in ""Single White Female"" with Bridget Fonda.",1088985600,,3846,4.598253275109171
466611,5,6302450187,"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, released in 1992, seems to have opened up people's eyes to the real evil in some people who masquerade as babysitters or people of friendly nature you can confide in but who only wish to do harm. Although this is downright drama and sensational, the stuff thrillers are made of, some of its content can in fact occur in real life and there have been many a case that has proven true. It was a thriller in the early 90's, although it may appear rather tame by comparison to our present thriller movies. On DVD, the experience is fresh and the sound quality is incredibly good. The DVD features the original trailer and commentary. It stars Rebecca De Mornay as the scheming and murderous baby-sitter Peyton, Annabella Sciorra as Claire, the hapless wife. The story moves slowly, building up tension to a climatic finale.
Peyton's husband, an obstratrician, sexually molests Claire who files a complaint and seeks to get him in jail. The obstratrician commits suicide and triggers a miscarriage in Peyton, who was about to have his child. So, there it is. The set-up. Peyton really does have valid reasons to be angry. She has lost everything -her husband, her baby and her home. But she is so consumed with bitterness and by her desire for revenge that she is stripped of her humanity and becomes an authentic villain so perfect for this type of film. Rebecca De Mornay's non-threatening, beautiful and innocent Caucasian features are a perfect disguise. She takes a job as babysitter to Claire's daughter Emma. Now safe in the family's trust, she conducts scheme after scheme to destroy Claire and to exact revenge. She is breastfeeding Claire's infant to mark the child as hers(Peyton proves that women can be just as territorial as men and just as ruthless, perhaps more so) she wins Emma's trust and affection by forging a false friendship, she frames the black help, who is a bit weak and slow but proves heroic in the finale, by making Claire believe he is sexually molesting Emma -she hides Emma's panties in a drawer in the storage room. She even tries to break up Claire and her husband by making Claire believe that he is having an affair with his old friend and sweetheart (played by Julian Moore who ends up killed in the greenhouse by Peyton) and Peyton even attempts to seduce Claire's husband for herself! There is no stopping her until her come-uppance comes just in time for the ending.
The dangerous ""outsider"" coming into the safety of a perfectly happy family really works as a thriller in cinema. We cannot sympathize with Peyton, because she is a very corrupt and vicious woman. Although we would like to see Claire, Sciorra's character, be more defensive and try to protect her family and even eliminate the villain herself, we cannot help but worry how it will turn out for her since she is not a very strong woman and is in fact a victim of asthma. The real star of the show is Rebecca De Mornay anyways and so it was fitting that Claire is a weak contrast by comparison to Rebecca's powerfully evil performance. The location was shot in Southern California somewhere near the Hollywood Hills or perhaps a suburban community, is tailor-made for the ambiance of a dark film such as this one. Who'd ever guess that such intense crime could happen in a small town that looks blameless ? The music is effectively chilling, although the composer or music editor seems to have delighted in playing with the theme of innocence mingled with evil- the soprano aria ""Poor Wondering One"" from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Pirates Of Penzance"" is played repeatedly as it seems to be an album that Claire has in her house. At one point, the orchestral score twists the cheerful melody by using darker and menacing instrumental themes
so that ""Poor Wondering One"" sounds more serious and visceral.
The rest of the music is appropriately detached, shocking and like most other thiller movie scores.",1079395200,3,3946,4.753644314868804
466612,4,6302450187,"The plot is a bit predictable.  You'll probably guess most of the plot twists before they come. The demented nanny.  The saintly, stuttering black handyman whom she has fired.  The mousy, asthmatic wife.  The clueless husband.  There are sadly, few surprises in this movie.

So why four stars instead of zero or one?  Well, Rebecca DeMornay is superbly chilling in the role.  She's absolutely believable as the nanny who has her very real reasons for going off the deep end.  (In fact one of the few surprises in the film is that she is given a solid reason for flipping out.  I sort of hate to say this, but I was kind of rooting for her over the very mousy Annabella Sciorra.)

The scene with DeMornay in the woman's bathroom at the arboretum was great.  Her character, Payton, was quite soulless, and she made you feel her chill.  She never plays a false note.  The stares she gave could stop people in their tracks.  You really do think this woman could kill.

Recommended.  Worth watching if you want a good, entertaining.  And DeMornay's character will stick with you for quite some time.  She's that good (and beautiful, to boot.)  Because of her story, you actually start rooting for her, except that she's gone around the bend a bit.",1076716800,18,1242,4.610091743119266

466664,3,6302450187,"Here's a movie whose premise is often unsettling, but the execution, when it takes off, keeps one's attention through thrills and chills. A doctor commits suicide after malpractice charges. His widow, who has apparently led a ""normal"" life before that, suddenly turns into a vengeful demon (just why is left unexplained). She targets the woman who first brought abuse charges against her deceased husband, posing as a nanny and moving in with a hidden motive of stealing her baby. The doctor's widow turned vengeful nanny is played by seldom-seen actress Rebecca de Mornay, in a generally commanding performance that could well make us wish to see her act in more movies. She's chilling as the grisly villain but a few of her actions are as unexplained as why she turns vengeful in the first place. At one point, as part of her plot, she destroys an important business letter to her target's husband (and father of the baby she plans to steal). She does so in a ""toilet stall"", preparing to flush the fragments of the letter. But for mysterious reasons she goes ballistic and seems to try to destroy the ""stall"" by beating it with a plunger. The mother she targets is played by Annabella Sciorra, who, in typical fashion for her, is part riveting, part exasperating. Her husband, played by Matt McCoy, is a longsuffering doter, exasperatingly longsuffering at times through his wife's travails. Julianne Moore has a supporting role in this movie, made before she had (at least to my knowledge) become anywhere nearly the major actress she is today. Her performance herein is a mixed bag, showing considerable acting potential but not clearly foreshadowing the significant actress she would become. But perhaps the show-stealing role herein is that of a mentally-challenged gardener, played by Ernie Hudson. Too bad movie makers apparently didn't take more note of his performance and recognize him as an actor who should have gone places. Given the right roles, I thought he should be one to eagerly wish to see again and again in the movies. But sadly, everywhere else I've seen him, he's far and away wasted compared to this role. Too bad some riveting performances seem to go so unnoticed.",1034467200,30,2192,4.927027027027027
466665,2,6302450187,"It's hard to believe the director of this faltering addition to Hollywood's yuppies-in-peril cycle of the early 1990s went on to make such outstanding films as ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys.""  To be fair, the fault lies mainly with the screenplay - a textbook working of an elaborate revenge plot which tries to exploit a whole range of middle-class anxieties: molesting doctors, black burglars, lurking pedophiles, old friends who want to steal your husband and, of course, nannies who want to take over your life. The plot is predictable and the ending deplorably contrived. Ultimately, though, it's Rebecca De Mornay who makes this thing endurable. She's so chillingly good as the vengeful Peyton that you're cheering when Annabella Sciorra finally gets to punch her in the face. Other performances are merely adequate, with the notable exception of Julianne Moore: she steals the few scenes she's given and shows why she, like director Hanson, has gone on to much bigger and better things.",1023235200,13,1000,5.172839506172839

The most sympathetic character in the film, the giant handyman Soloman, is a modern-day Lennie from Of Mice And Men. It was he who captured my interest and it was his fate, more so than the husband and wife who employed him, that I followed with the greatest interest.

Well, it all goes wrong after the picture is filmed.  It goes to the  editing department.  A musical score is plugged in that makes you wince  with pain--it takes the beautiful ""Poor Wandering One"" by Gilbert  & Sullivan and plays it lugubriously over the opening credits, getting  one of the notes wrong and one of the important chords wrong.  Thus,  instead of a bittersweet tune (which the adapter may have wanted), it turns  into a sophomoric howler.  But that's just for starters.  What really goes  wrong in the editing process is that the editor was out to lunch.  No  sensitivity for pacing.  The movie plods along.  The editor killed it,  stuffing it with scenes that take too long and characterizations that were  obvious minutes ago--as if the stupid audience needs more time to let it  all ""sink in.""  What a waste of Hollywood creativity!  Maybe the  editor fought with the director, and maybe it was really the director's  fault, though I personally believe that the person who has final cut is the  most important person in most movies, and here the final cut was an  abomination.  This might be one of those rare films that work better on TV  with commercial breaks.  The commercials would dull your sensibilities, and  you can pick up with the film afterwards, and settle into it at the languid  pace the editor chose.  But on DVD, which is how I just viewed it, it's a  movie that shoots itself in the foot.  Every element that was necessary for  an outstanding movie was there, but it was ruined after the actors and  directors and camerapersons went home.
