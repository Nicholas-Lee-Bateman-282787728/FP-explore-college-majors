7968123,3,B00006FXDG,Nice DVDs but they are getting a bit outdated for my high school kids,1468022400,,69,4.0
7968124,3,B00006FXDG,"This is a nice introductory series on A&P.  I would have liked it to be a bit more indepth educationally but then, maybe it was intended for a different audience.  It make a great series for high school level classes and non science majors.  I found some (but not all) of the sections useful as an introduction to various body systems in a college level class.  My main complaint about this series is the price.  Considering how long it has been on the market it should be considerably less expensive.",1299801600,,501,4.522222222222222
7968125,1,B00006FXDG,"First of all, let me say, that I recieved the product very quickly. As for the condition of it, marvelous! The actual series itself, the quality of photography/cinematogrophy, almost in the novice league. It also seemed like something from the 80's. I personnaly like more up-to-date products. I returned it, for a National Geographic, and Nova series.",1201392000,9,352,5.192982456140351
7968126,1,B00006FXDG,"It's unfortunate that this DVD series of the human body did not meet my expectations. Indeed, I would have to say that it was a great disappointment.

What need to be brought to the attention of the consumer is that these series are very old and are not in any way a very detailed program. It's unfortunate that these series are still on the market, especially for a whooping $150.00. These DVD's are very poor in digital quality and sound. The narrators are boring and learning the human body is a bore, using this collection.

It's a 1994 production with a price tag of 2006. Rip off? I think so.

If this collection of DVD's were sold for $40 I would have to rate it 5 stars. The human body is very interesting indeed, but on these DVD's it makes the body a body boring organism to learn about.

Save your money.. I'm so upset that I wasted my money on this.",1160611200,36,861,4.296296296296297
7968127,5,B00006FXDG,"This DVD set is one of the best documentaries I've seen up to date. Spectacular animations combined with easy to understand information. A hard to understand subject which we would assume was for medical doctors only, became a subject which we all could enjoy, understand and possibly use in our daily lives. An outstanding collection!!",1063238400,17,336,5.127272727272727
