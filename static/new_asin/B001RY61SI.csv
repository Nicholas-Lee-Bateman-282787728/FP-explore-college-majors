8339253,5,B001RY61SI,"I got this movie as I was trying to find out where the term ""Pura Vida"" used by so many Costa Ricans comes from. Wikipedia suggested it comes from this movie and what a pleasant surprise I stumbled upon.

This movie is super funny and made me laugh throughout the entire movie. I have never laughed so hard. The story is simple and you can foresee what will happen, but every single time the worst case scenario happens.

I can just recommend this movie, and if you really need a good laugh, this is the movie to watch!",1353110400,2,519,4.285714285714286
