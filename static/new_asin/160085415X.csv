7800121,4,160085415X,I picked up many great pointers on doing crown molding such as setting up and using jigs to mark exactly where the crown molding should be positioned and in making mockups to decide which molding looks best. The baseboard and window molding was straight forward. I would give this video 5 stars but my biggest question in doing crown molding was left out. How do you figure out the angle of cut on a  compound miter if an outside angle is not exactly 90 or 270 degrees? Was it there but I missed it? I think I have it figured out through reading other sources but this video should have pulled it all together and it didn't. Still I'm grateful for the information it did convey and I am glad I made the purchase.,1475971200,,712,4.313432835820896
