6308695,5,B00J0ZVJMY,"I saw this movie when it came out in the 1970's and it made an impression on me.  It was hard to find here in the US, so I was happy I was able to find it internationally.  The description stated that it works on all DVD players.  It did not, which is common with DVD's purchased overseas.  We were able to play it on the lap top and connected it to the TV, so it worked out in the end. The seller did offer to reimburse us since it would not play on the DVD player as stated but with a little work connecting the laptop to the TV, we were satisfied with the purchase and did not accept reimbursement.  The movie is as sweet, as I remembered it.",1423094400,6,645,3.9307692307692306

6308698,5,B00J0ZVJMY,"This is truly a beautiful love story, with a wonderful soundtrack by Sir Elton John. However this version is in the PAL format and will not play on American dvd/bluray players. The packaging and the dvd says it is in the NTSC format, but this is incorrect. Beware, if you get it and have to return it, you will have to pay the shipping costs back to Thailand.",1405641600,11,359,4.294117647058823

8647173,5,B00J0ZVJMY,"This is a classic film with wonderful scenes, music and romance. The Elton John sound track is wonderful. The film would be a very popular classic if it weren't for the fact that it depicts love, elopement and the living together of two teenagers. This film is no longer politically correct, but taken as a work of art from the seventies, it is very enjoyable.",1458259200,,360,4.553846153846154
8647174,4,B00J0ZVJMY,There's probably a lot of hay that critics can make of what's wrong with this film. I'm not an objective reviewer. With me it's nostalgia and a sweet fantasy story that's more imaginative than anything I've seen in years. What's wrong with that?,1455926400,,245,4.72093023255814
