7166781,5,B00X99RMLE,"This is a great DVD. However, I expected to hear some interviews or details about the band. I'm a huge fan of Black Veil Brides so just the live show was worth the purchase for me. If you want more than that it may not be a good buy for you.

7166793,3,B00X99RMLE,"As a big BVB's fan, this is a tough review for me to write.  This DVD is a mixed bag.  Visually it is very well done, just fine from a video standpoint.  It's the audio that has serious issues.  1st, and the biggest problem is the audio is horribly mixed.  It's is way overdone in the mixing, bassy, boomy and distorted.  You will have to completely re-EQ your stereo system to listen to this DVD.  It was completely unlistenable to when I first put the DVD into my DVD player.  You will have to back your bass way down and tweak your mids/highs to make this listenable.

As a guitar player who has played in live bands for 30 years, I see other big problems with this DVD as far as it being ""live"".  There is nothing ""live"" about Andy's vocals on this DVD.  They were all completely overdubbed in the studio.  Many, many times in this video you can see Andy's mouth movement does not match up to the vocals.  The guitarwork was also overdubbed in the studio to some extent, possibly the entire thing.  One particularly funny moment is when Jake is soloing, Jinxx is playing rhythm and then holds both arms/hands over his head and the rhythm guitar just keeps playing.

If you can tweak the audio to fix the horrible mix and not get caught up in the fact that there really isn't much ""live"" about this DVD, it is entertaining to watch.  I just can't get over how bad the audio is, really terrible boomy mix.",1443916800,5,1407,4.333333333333333

8715461,5,B00X99RMLE,"My daughter introduced me to this group. While they are very young, they are a highly polished band who models themselves after some of the old school bands that I grew up with, like Kiss, Motley Crue, G 'N R, etc... I do not like a lot of the newer bands because quite frankly, they simply can't hold a candle to the old school bands. This group is an exception. I enjoyed just about all of the songs that they played, and I also enjoyed the fact that they had a very charismatic stage presence, and put on an exciting show. The audio, and video were out of this world, especially if you have a very high quality home theater system to enjoy it on. This group is going places!!",1471132800,5,678,4.223076923076923
