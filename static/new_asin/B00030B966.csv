8433760,5,B00030B966,The copy I had wasn't good so I needed another copy.  I bought this and it came quick and worked great.  I have a DVD player that will copy movies to a DVD. I was able to do this with this video.  So now the video won't go bad because it's on a DVD where VHS tapes only last so long.,1398816000,,283,3.6065573770491803
