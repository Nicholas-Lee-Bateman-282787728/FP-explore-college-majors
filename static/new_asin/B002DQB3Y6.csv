8365751,3,B002DQB3Y6,"Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler were teamed for the sixth and the last time in this film, incidentally this was also her penultimate work for the WB Studio. The story is an impoverished musical with Hugh Herbert as an eccentric millionaire who against his family wishes entrusts a gold-digging floozy (Joan Blondell) with his dress shop. His nephew Dick Powell hires Ruby Keeler. It is a mindless brew directed by Alfred Green and performed by Keeler in less than acceptable portrayal. Louise Fazenda, Paul Draper, Marie Wilson and Hobart Cavanaugh were in the supporting cast. The dance numbers were due to Bobby Connolly. Songs included; I don't have to dream again, youve got to know how to dance, an evening with you and boulevardier.",1446595200,,734,4.92741935483871

8365754,4,B002DQB3Y6,"Colleen is a rather good little film; it's also the last film to pair Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler. The plot moves along well; I wasn't ever bored. True, there were one or two more plot twists than I thought was truly necessary but it's all so good this becomes a minor quibble; I doubt you'll have any trouble following along. The sets are terrific especially in the scenes for the musical numbers and the acting is very convincing. Some have said that the script was not as good as in other films of this genre but I liked the numerous one-liners and sight gags. The musical score enhances the film even when it is merely background music and the misunderstandings between the characters spice up the plot. Moreover, the cinematography and the choreography both reflect careful forethought. The print could use a restoration.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Donald Ames, III (Dick Powell) who runs the family business although they let Uncle Cedric Ames (Hugh Herbert) think he's the top banana; Cedric is a nut who couldn't manage a pet rock even if his life depended on it! Cedric's wife Alicia (Louise Fazenda) isn't really any more stable; she's quite the nervous, strident type who doesn't always realize Cedric is fooling around with other women behind her back!

We also meet Joe Cork (Jack Oakie) who is kinda-sorta engaged to Colleen Reilly (Ruby Keeler) who lives with her father ""pop"" (J.M. Kerrigan). Joe dreams up terrible schemes to get rich quick while Colleen thinks he should get ""a real job"" and make some money so she and Joe can get married. But Joe has got his sights on Cedric and it isn't long before Cedric hires Joe to be his personal assistant along with Joe's gold digging pal Minnie Hawkins (Joan Blondell). And soon after that Cedric essentially gets conned into buying the dress shop where Colleen is the manager! This leads to Donald looking over the books at the dress shop where he meets Colleen; sparks quickly begin to fly...

Cedric is also being pursued by Minnie without his wife Alicia knowing anything about it; and big trouble starts when Cedric wants to adopt Minnie! Of course there's much more to the story but I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy this movie as much as I did. Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out.

Look also for solid performances by Paul Draper as Paul Gordon, a magnificent professional dancer; Luis Alberni as Carlo; Hobart Cavanaugh as Noggin; Berton Churchill as Logan; Charles Coleman as a butler and if you look closely you'll see Ward Bond as Sweeney, a police officer.

Colleen is an excellent film for fans of the actors in it. In addition, people who enjoy movie musicals from the golden years of Hollywood with romance, drama and some comedy thrown in will not be disappointed.",1367193600,,2810,4.668686868686868
8365755,3,B002DQB3Y6,"""Colleen"" is the last musical which paired the singing Dick Powell with the dancing Ruby Keeler, big stars at Warner Brothers in the thirties.  The film is unusual for Warners.  If you're thinking Busby Berkeley, then forget it because by 1936, when the film was released, the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers films were dominant and their influence is obvious here. Keeler plays a dress shop manager and Powell the nephew of an excentric millionaire, Hugh Herbert.  Powell turns up to close the loss making business and romance obviously arises.  The outcome is as predictable as it is genial.  Along the way, we have Joan Blondell as a dumb blonde chocolate dipper, a toned down gold digger of course, paired with Jack Oakie as a brainless Bronx con-man and Louise Fazenda, shrill and unfunny as Herbert's long suffering and hypocondriac wife.  Blondell and Oakie steal the film with their amusing number ""A Boulevardier from the Bronx"".

Keeler's charm, her greatest asset, is in abundance in this film and Powell sings some delightful Harry Warren hits. Broadway dancer, Paul Draper, was imported to dance with Keeler and puts her through 2 extensive and entertaining dance routines, probably the most complex dancing she recorded on film. She also sings 2 songs in her weak voice so the film is quite a showcase for her. The finale is a spectacular dance number with chorus of the catchy ""Gotta Know how to dance"" and the distinctive Warner's sound directed by Ray Heindorf is terrific.

The print of the film is poor. Since the DVD is one of the Warner's Archive Collection, it is also expensive.  The original theatrical trailer is the only extra included.",1261440000,11,1657,4.931654676258993
