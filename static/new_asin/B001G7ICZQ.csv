3597576,5,B001G7ICZQ,"Naruto's original storyline went up to episode 135 which was around 25 volumes of manga. When compared to DBZ which took 291 episodes (including filler ) with a similar amount of manga. Heres where filler comes in to play for naruto  . episodes 136-220 are all filler! The reason was to avoid going ahead of the manga. Onto the review. This is a 6 part review as boxsets 11-16 make up the filler arc . This set includes 3 arcs. one involving a misson to collect info on orochimaru, One involving a leaf village prison break. And the final one involving a search for a bug. This is spoiler free by the way. Each boxset includes 2 or 3 mini arcs (2-5 episodes long) and some additional single episode stories. in these arcs naruto will go on missions with the other leaf genin. The best arc in boxset 11 is the prison break.",1349308800,,822,4.372549019607843
3597577,5,B001G7ICZQ,Bought as a gift for a fan of the show. They loved it! So if you are a fan I recommend it!,1341446400,,90,3.1363636363636362
3597578,5,B001G7ICZQ,"I know many people absolutely despise filler episodes, but some of them are well-written and have interesting plots. In this box set, we have Naruto, Sakura and Jiraiya traveling to locate Orochimaru's hideout in search of Sasuke, Mizuki's return, and the pre-Bikochu arc.
Although it may not be canon, Mizuki's backstory is given a bit of depth.

There are some really funny moments in this set, (Mostly involving Sasame Fuuma), and if you consider yourself a Naruto fan, or even just a collector of anime boxed sets, you wouldn't be wrong in going for this one.",1326153600,,563,4.864583333333333

3597580,3,B001G7ICZQ,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 11 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and thirty-six through one hundred and forty-nine of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  There are three story arcs included on this set.  The first is Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya's mission to the Land of Rice Paddies.  The second is the Mizuki Strikes Back arc.  The third is the start of the search for the Bikochu bug arc.

The first extra included in this DVD set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto Uncut Box Set 12, which runs for roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and thirty-seven.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, the Naruto manga, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for: Bleach The Movie: Memories of Nobody, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, and Buso Renkin.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Bleach: Shattered Blade.

Once again, these extras are what I've come to expect from the Naruto Uncut box sets.  Even so, I still find myself wishing that Viz Media had gone to more effort to provide a better variety of extras on the sets, instead of being so ""cookie cutter"" with them.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 11 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1276560000,,2236,4.598484848484849
3597581,5,B001G7ICZQ,"This is a great set just like all of Naruto's box sets. Don't listen to any one when they say this is a bad set. I have all of the sets and they are all great. The anime on this set is great, to me it is no diffterent then on the other sets. So what these are fillers they are still great. They are well worth the money.",1237852800,,320,3.652173913043478
3597582,3,B001G7ICZQ,"What more can be said that hasn't been said already?  This is the first of six boxes that will contain the 85 ""filler"" episodes of Naruto.  For those who don't know what defines an episode as filler it is the fact that the episode(s) in question are not based on the manga in which the series Naruto is derived.  (Manga are Japanese comic books).

(The following review will contain minimal spoilers)

Now are these episodes actually worth the purchase?  In my opinion yes they are worth the $30-35 you can find these sets for.  The first story arc is six episodes long and follows Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya as they attempt to infiltrate Orochimaru's lair in pursuit of Sasuke.  I thought the first half of this story was decent for what it was but quickly turned, for lack of a better word, weird.  I also noticed that the premise of this series has been changing little by little since the very beginning of the show-less focus on Jutsu and more on just 'power,' which reminds me of Dragon Ball Z a bit.  Now the second story arc brings back and old foe from the first season.  Like the previous arc: started off great but seemed drug out a bit, but definitely watchable.  Additionally there is a noticeable dip in animation quality as other reviewers have pointed out; not that Naruto was ever known for it's stellar animation.  As of now we have covered the first twelve episodes of this fourteen episode set.  Wrapping things up we have the beginning of a third story arc involving Naruto, Hinata, Shino, and Kiba searching for a special kind of insect they hope can assist them in their search for Sasuke.

Overall this set was definitely the worst of the eleven thus far, but as I stated earlier, definitely worth the thirty or so dollars if you are already a fan of the series.  I was fortunate to dive into this set with the prior knowledge that this box contained sub-par filler episodes and such did not have high expectations.

I will be reviewing the remaining Naruto filler sets as they are released if you are interested in reading more of my reviews.",1236643200,,2068,4.560975609756097
3597583,5,B001G7ICZQ,This is a series that you must have.  Lots of action and great graphics.,1232409600,,72,4.142857142857143
3597584,5,B001G7ICZQ,Purchased this for my Grandson he has everyone in the series. He couldn't believe I had been able to get the latest one. He had his before any of his friends. Amazon was great getting it out in time for Christmas.,1232323200,,213,4.219512195121951
3597585,3,B001G7ICZQ,"With this box set we see the start of a long string of filler episodes in Naruto.

Personally I have mixed feelings about these episodes. While none of the filler arcs have much depth and aren't nearly as engrossing as the main story, they can still be fun to watch. In fact, some of them are fairly interesting. We get to see a more obscure character like Mizuki get fleshed out a bit more, and, canonical or not, it actually gives him a motive for his actions in the first episode.

In conclusion if you want some extra Naruto and don't mind filler, then you won't be wasting your money on this set. However, if you want to see the story actually progress, save up and wait for Shippuden to come out.",1230249600,,702,4.3106060606060606
3597586,1,B001G7ICZQ,"Up until this point, Naruto has been an amazing and well-thought up series, and has kept me watching it simply because it never ceased to amaze me.  But I realize that at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, the anime studio that brought the series to life from its comic book source hit a brick wall; they feared that they may catch up to it and may not give its creator enough time to put the storyline into fruition and thus may ruin the consistent flow and pacing that the series had (I believe it was at least two chapters per episode).

But instead of taking a break or even taking an entirely different path with the storyline altogether, the anime company decide to throw in what may be considered the worst filler to ever grace television.  This wouldn't have really mattered, but it stretched for over 100+ episodes.  This serves nothing to its fans other than to cash in on its immense popularity.  As a fan of Naruto, I feel insulted because this particular anime company seems to believe that fans wouldn't care about the quality of the series, as long as there's a consistent quantity available.

Now I don't have a problem with some filler.  I've seen anime that have had filler episodes and they were considerably good.  But episode after episode of Naruto filler and you start to wonder why they even bothered.  It's like they flocked to the internet and read subpar fanfiction as their source of inspiration.  Simply put, each ""arc"" consists of Naruto and his friends looking for Sasuke, running to a village, meeting a key character that doesn't like him and Naruto doesn't like key character; they discover some plot element that puts people in danger or may be significant to finding Sasuke, they fight and win, then at the end of it all, Naruto and key character become best pals even though any leads they have to finding Sasuke are a dud.

Do not waste your time with this box set or the future ones.  Even if you are a big fan of the show, they are not worth the effort. I understand it is not Viz Media's fault that Naruto has an endless desert of filler episodes, but there are other ways to support the series without buying these box sets.  Go out and buy the comic books, or buy the franchise video games that are available on the 360 or PS3.  Or best yet, buy the Naruto Shippuden box sets as soon as they come out (or you can even watch the latest Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website for free). But do not waste your time with this one.",1227484800,,2471,4.474387527839643
3597587,3,B001G7ICZQ,"As the other reviews posted have stated the episodes that begin here right to the end of the series are filler  The $34.99 pre-order price on box set 10 seems to validate this as 11 drops to $29.99.

Filler isn't the only problem, however.  Another major let down with these episodes is animation quality.  Shippuuden was released directly after this series ends without missing a beat.  Sadly this must have required the top artists working on the project because they definitely didn't do any of these episodes.  The consistently beautiful animation was one of the major factors that first drew me to Naruto.  It's not found here and actually seems to get progressively worse.

I'd give every box set up to this point a 5 star rating.  They are packaged well and pretty fairly priced compared to a lot of other anime series' I've bought in the past ($29.99 a dvd for DragonBall Z with  just 3 episodes comes to mind.)  A lot of work has to go into the dubbing of a Japanese series to English, and you can play these dvds with direct translation subtitles and it's nearly word for word.  This is one of my favorite parts of the box sets because I have watched some translated anime (again DBZ comes to mind) that left me wondering what the hell they were doing when they started making up their own dialogue.  In addition each box set has had a major development or introduction of characters and plot twists that leaves you anxiously waiting for the next set.  These episodes actually do quite the opposite too often making you cringe at how bad they get.

I still plan to buy the sets for my collection as I recommend other fans do to support the series and anime in general.  Just take the reviews here into consideration before you start to watch them to help ease the pain.  You can also take solace in the fact that Shippuuden comes after these do and makes up for it.",1224806400,,1875,4.5
3597588,4,B001G7ICZQ,"If any of you happen to be purchasing this box set, you may or may not know that this where the filler arc begins.  These episodes were not originally in the manga, but instead show events that happen before the Shippuden the next installment of the Naruto series.

While they weren't in the original story, the fillers aren't really that bad at all.  They're just not as action packed, plus some of the episodes really don't make much sense at all.  And don't go any near as in depth when it comes to plot.  While some of the arcs are semi-long, most are not.  The plot of the arcs instead resembles more of a Saturday morning cartoon as many of the filler episodes are stand-alone and don't require knowledge of the previous episode to understand what's happening.  And so some people who watch Naruto don't enjoy them, others do.  If you're a big Naruto fan and want to complete your collection than go for it.  If you don't like the fillers than don't waste your time, it's a personally choice.  I'd say it's worth a few laughs and I plan on picking it up.",1224374400,,1060,4.417525773195877
3597589,2,B001G7ICZQ,"IF you are a super dooper Naruto Fan, this is the beginning of the SUPER FILLERS of the series which DOES NOT Follow the Manga at all. For those who want something to FILL their time until SHIPPUDEN Box Sets Arrive this would be what you want.

For those who want true to the books STOP HERE your collection is done. Go buy other sets.",1224288000,,335,4.153846153846154
