7801515,5,1932131086,"Every Christian should see this series. This series  covers two basic subjects:  (1) who is going to the ""heaven"" that's described in the Bible, the same ""heaven"" Jesus Christ of Nazereth talked about in The New Testament and; (2)  everything you wanted  to know about ""rewards and repayments"" in this heaven.  The Author, Bruce Wilkinson is as credentialed as anyone else you might think has a better ""Truth"" concerning these subjects. If you are a NEW Christian or one who has served for many long and hard years you will be encouraged by these scriptural presentations.  It's never too late to send treasure to heaven - YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU.  Subject (1) and (2) are both in 4, 30 minute programs.  These can be used as great seminars or Sunday school teachings. there are teaching aids available for students and teachers. Excellent!",1398729600,,843,4.805555555555555
