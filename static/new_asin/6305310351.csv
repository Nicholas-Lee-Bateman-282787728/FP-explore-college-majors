1007094,3,6305310351,I saw this movie on TBS during Dinner and a Movie and they pointed out one hilarious part of the movie and that was that the sounds that girl made in the movie.  They sounded incredibly fake.  The movie had a predictable premise but I liked the snake lady she was cool to look at.  This movie doesn't seem to be a favorite among people and I don't know why.  The DVD is okay but still has no good extra features.,1027296000,,412,4.049382716049383
1007095,4,6305310351,"Murphy was so popular before this flick came out, somebody wrote at the time, that he could survive if it flopped.  ""Golden Child"" was a commercial disappointment and it did hurt him.  To this day, I don't know why.
Murphy is Chandler Jerroll - an LA-based PI with a flip attitude on anything.  He's a hero of the city of angels, but he's no angel himself.  In short, he is the ""chosen one"", the foretold hero destined to save the ""golden child"" from evil.  While Jerroll searches LA for lost children, the enchanted golden child rises in spiritual purity in a snowy monastery in the Himalayas.  The wicked forces of Sardo Numspar (Charles Dance) invade the monastery and, after overrunning the monks, spirit the boy away in a cage.  The boy, it turns out, is one of a line of divine lamas upon whom the world rests, and whom evil must destroy.  Dark Forces had already claimed other golden children.  With the loss of the ""bringer of justice"", the death of another golden child will plunge the world into hell.  Why Murphy is the ""Chosen One"" (and who's doing the choosing here?) are subjects the script keeps wisely away from.  Instead, what we get is a deft mix of high adventure and comedy.  It shouldn't work at all, but Murphy mugs on cue and can handle the preposterousness of the situation - a modern LA guy having to battle the forces of evil.  The joke of the flick is that Eddie Murphy is the Chosen One - only a comically refined mind could effectively mix the fun and action like he does.  Crude special effects aside, the fantasy mixes well with the comedy, and Murphy's light touch plays well off of the evil Numspar and Charlotte Lewis as Jerrol's love interest.  This is simply an underappreciated classic.",1020902400,30,1723,4.5667752442996745
1007096,4,6305310351,"Raymond Charrell(Murphy) must rescue the Golden Child in order to save the world from the Devil(Dance).
He is helped by a girl(Lewis) who told him that he is the chosen one.
So he goes to Nepal to find the sacred Adjanti dagger the only can destroy the devil  and save the child.
As always Murphy fast speech and comic gestures are well welcome as he says Gimme the knife,please! the best in all the movie.
A worth view of an expensive Dvd with no extras only the trailer.
Enjoy!",1017792000,,479,4.382022471910112
1007097,3,6305310351,"Eddie Murphy is funny here but the story is so bogus that all it has is Murphy`s name to carry it through. Murphy plays a social worker who specializes in finding lost children, is hired by an tibertian woman to locate an anjelliac child who was kidnapped by demoic forces. I give Eddie Murphy credit he did his best in trying to make something out of a mediocre script with his humor but he should of stayed away from the person(s) who talked him into making this film. After seeing this film i see why Eddie Murphy was anxious to do BEVERLY HILLS COP II a year later and try to regain his box office bankabillty.",972432000,,614,4.301724137931035

1007099,4,6305310351,"I think it odd that the movie critics trashed this ""megahit""  If it sucked so bad, why did everyone go to see it.

Unfortunately, the movie critics above perpetuate the general prejudice against comedies (esp. in such institutions as the Academy), and claim it to be ""Top  candidate for the worst megahit of all time."" Obviously they are  saying that it was a huge hit, ie. that everyone went to it, and told  others to go to it, yet it has no merit whatsover. Don't listen to them.  It's a fantastic movie, filled with the type of humor that Murphy has  become famous for. - A definate buy if you have ever liked an Murphy  comedy.",947808000,6,575,4.533980582524272

This is Eddies best film (followed closely by coming  to America and Beverly hills cop) and I beleive it will stay in that  position for many years to come.,942624000,10,389,4.6911764705882355

Eddie Murphy does his hyper, casually sexist, over confident  improvised schtick for EVERY line, but DAMN if the man doesn't have legendary delivery.  The Asian mysticism as seen from a skeptical Westerner perspective is distinctly dated, and could register as offensive by today's standards.

Golden Child is just such an artifact of 80's flicks.  A Chosen One, demons, cultists, martial arts, hair metal, stop-motion animation, biker gangs, Charles Dance as an evil wizard-pimp.  It's like the freak twin film of Big Trouble in Little China.  It even has Victor Wong and James Hong.

It is a more subdued comedy than Eddie's earlier stuff but it works quite well.  Eddie is a detective that specialises in searching for missing children, and there seem to be more of them every day.  When a woman come to him to help finding a special child (the Golden Child) he treats it like any other missing child case, until the weird stuff starts happening.

1008356,4,6305310351,"The Golden Child was a box office success, the eighth biggest film of the year (1986).  It is a comedy, or so they would have you believe.  But the only member of the cast to approach it that way was Eddie Murphy as Chandler Jarrell (finder of lost children).  Charles Dance, as the allegedly evil villain Sardo Numspa, simply looks bewildered throughout (as does much of the rest of the cast).  It is an odd movie, a fantasy of sorts.  Murphy's character is supposed to rescue a boy (played by a girl).  The kid is mystical; he can turn pop cans into tap dancing creations, when he's not resurrecting dead butterflies and the odd corpse.  The jokes are pounded into the ground without much enthusiasm.  (Apparently, the role of Chandler Jarrell was first offered to Mel Gibson!!!)  The special effects are a bit slapdash, when there are any.  There was actually a bidding war for this script.  Frank (Scooby-Doo) Welker did the voice of The Thing.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life (I've lost track of the number of times I've watched it).  It isn't high art but it is fun in a train-wreck sort of way.",1396828800,2,1131,4.53960396039604

While the special effects are somewhat cheesy in spots, the overall visuals here are pretty good.  The acting is adequate for this type of film and the writing mostly is up to par if you are willing to suspend reality for awhile!  Overall a fun romp if you don't nit pick the details.  Ms. Lewis is not hard to look at either as Eddies female lead!  What's it about?  See the hundred other reviews!

Our children enjoy this movie and have lots of fun and laughs watching this movie. It is nice for them to see the Eddie Murphy back in the day and then see his current movies. It is nice to be able to show our children what T.V. used to be like and why we don't like what is on T.V. now.

We don't have cable any more due to all the trash on T.V. we use Netflix and stream Netflix on our Roku and Logi Revue (Google T.V.) We have a more quality life and more time on our hands since we don't channel surf. We can watch T.V. when we want to at an affordable price thanks to Netflix and our streaming devices. This is the way T.V. should be. No need for the inflation that happens every month/year. This is another reason it is nice to see this movie, you can see (and also show your children) what the price of things used to be when you see some of the background in this movie.

This movie will not disappoint you. This is a great movie and will make a great addition to your collection.  If you listen to the critics you will miss out on a great movie!

Stop, sit back and relax and enjoy this movie and pay attention to how times have changed. This is a great comedy and yes we are Eddie Murphy fans! We do own most of his movies. Check this movie out for your self and see for your self.

What ever happen to those days when T.V. was watchable? T.V. with values and morals, where did it go. Well at least we have some movies to look back on.

Bring the clean movies and clean T.V. back.. No need for what we are seeing on T.V. and in Hollywood these days. What a lack of creativity in Hollywood now days.

Enjoy we sure are!",1361664000,,1914,4.015789473684211

I was able to change the regional code on my laptop and get the movie to play (in English). Unfortunately, I'm limited to only being able to watch this DVD on my laptop. Also I did have to change the subtitles which defaulted to another language to ""no subtitles"". That was probably the easiest part of this whole transaction.

Like the official critic reviews above, I beg to differ. I love low brow, I'll just get that off my chest, the only criteria a movie needs to meet in my opinion is did it do its job of entertaining me, even if production value is low and the acting was wooden but it provided hilarity then it did its job. ""The Golden Child"" isn't a second ""Citizen Kane"" nor does it try to be, if your looking for Oscar worthy script or performance, look elsewhere. This movie however is a funny, action filled, slam bam thank you mam, typical 80's fantasy where a child is born the new Dali Lama, the reincarnation of the Buddhist's equivalent of Jesus. He has come to save and heal the world, there are dark forces out to destroy him and Eddie Murphy plays the social worker who seeks to protect and deliver him to safety. I know not a original plot and yes it is kind of stupid (demon skeleton is outdated and  the director seemed to have a fascination with oatmeal and blood yuck!), but stupid can be entertaining. Especially 80's stupid which is the best.

It is a bit of an oddball cross between an oriental story of mysticism and a US big city detective story with a little Murphy goofyness thrown in to boot. I will say the music sucks.

The music is terrible to say the least. It seems to me like they went way cheap on selecting the person to write the soundtrack and many other tracks sounds like cheap 80's music produced in someone's basement.

1008731,3,6305310351,"Boy, this flick was a lot better when I saw it as a kid in the 1980s. Now, the material seems horribly dated and the movie, compared to today's CG technology, suffers from decidedly less than spectacular special effects (though the animated dancing Pepsi can is still cute). Also grating on the nerves now is the strident electronic chords and horns heard in the soundtrack. Not as good and diverting as BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, THE GOLDEN CHILD, which came out in the same year (1986), shares the same Eastern mysticism, horror/fantasy elements, and tongue-in-cheek tone.

Plot SPOILERS begin:

In Los Angeles, fez-wearing Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy), finder of lost children, is pestered by exotically beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) into searching for the Golden Child, a magical Buddhist boy kidnapped from Tibet who is prophesied to save the world. When a connection seemingly links the missing Golden Boy to a murdered girl Jarrell had been looking for, he reluctantly takes on Kee Nang's case. Jarrell is told that he's the Chosen One, the one destined to find the Golden Child. Over the course of the film, as inexplicable supernatural events persist in surfacing, Jarrell's initial mocking incredulity transforms into gradual belief. Witnessing freaky dreams, demons, reptilian women, and enigmatic men materializing and dematerializing into thin air will do that. Everything hinges on his unearthing the Ajanti Dagger, an otherworldy artifact capable of killing the Golden Child but capable of also turning the tide in Jarrell's favor.

Given, Eddie Murphy isn't at his best here, for some reason, though his trademark bray of a laugh is ever present. Maybe because of the action-heavy, horror-oriented plot, less emphasis is placed on comedy, although this feature still offers vestiges of the funny (I know this is unPC but my favorite line in the film is Murphy's aside to the Golden Child: ""Did you have Star Search in Tibet? Probably not...you probably have Food Search.""). I recall only two instances where Eddie seriously cuts loose with his patented Axel Foley jive (in the unconvincing Kathmandu airport scene and later in the ""Brother Numsy"" routine, also in an airport). His character of Jarrell does present the familiar smirky, wisecracking persona we've all come to know and love, but he's definitely not as effectively funny here as in, say, 48 HOURS, TRADING PLACES, or BEVERLY HILLS COP. Another detriment is that the romance seems somewhat forced to me as Eddie and Charlotte Lewis display little chemistry. Too, that insipid dream segment annoyed the living crap out of me.

End SPOILERS.

It's hard to criticize a gorgeous woman like Charlotte Lewis but, sadly, she proves to be tepid in her performance. Fortunately, I didn't care all that much because the eye candy she embodies more than made up for her lackluster acting (Gawd, that sexy face, those enticing gams, that shot of her on the bed in that blue shirt and panties!) and her character does gain bonus points for her somersaults and her use of martial arts. Charles Dance (the contact lens-happy villain of THE LAST ACTION HERO) carries off his dastardly role of Sardo Numspa with sinister British aplomb, while young J.L. Reate is fine as the close-mouthed but cute bald child of prophecy. Ex-boxer Randall ""Tex"" Cobb has a minor role as a childlike baddie while James Hong and the terrific Victor Wong (both are in BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA) also appear.

While not the most horrible movie he ever made, THE GOLDEN CHILD is still a lesser light in the Eddie Murphy oeuvre. Simply put, it just isn't as good as his more prominent films (the three mentioned above, as well as his later, more family-oriented features). Having said that, I did enjoy it as a child and it does have its merits. If you have a hankering for fantasy/horror, a touch of kung fu, a whiff of irreverent comedy, and the hot Charlottle Lewis to slobber over, well, THE GOLDEN CHILD is the dvd to pop in. Three stars for this one, for nostalgia's sake.",1172361600,3,4031,4.955621301775148
1008772,2,6305310351,"This is a bland action adventure typical of the 1980s.

Eddie Murphy is a detective specializing in finding missing children.  He likes kids, so we know he's a good guy.  Then he's hired to find the ""Golden Child,"" a child mystic who was kidnapped from a Tibetan monestary.  If the child dies, evil shall rule the world.

The script just meanders.  Murphy goes here and there on his misadventures, making wisecracks that just lay there.  As does the script.  He fights a biker gang and Chinese gangsters, meets demons, Tibetan monks, and always shows his trademark irreverance.

But Murphy's character is bland (unlike his more fully realized character in COMING TO AMERICA).  And his wisecracks are old and predictable.  He enters a room to kill a bad guy, then the bad guy turns into a demon.  So Murphy thinks better of it and leaves, wisecracking, ""Okay, I can see you're busy.  I'll talk to you later.""

It's not a horrible film.  Charlotte Lewis is attractive, and there's some decent action sequences.  But characters, storyline, dialogue are full of cliches and tired old wisecraks.  Utterly predictiable as it meaders from start to finish.",1161475200,3,1148,4.895833333333333

1008776,5,6305310351,"""The Golden Child"" is an interesting, fun and action packed comic/adventure with a touch of horror where Jarrel (Eddie Murphy) stars as the Chosen One. In this role, he has the ""onerous"" responsibility of finding the ""Golden Child"". The Golden Child is a Buddhist child with supernatural powers who was kidnapped by some evil villains and sorcerers. I first saw this film in the late 1980s and I loved it. I still enjoy watching it to this day, particularly the sarcastic humour typical of Eddie Murphy.

Eddie Murphy plays the reluctant hero, having been thrust into an unnatural and supernatural world of sorcery and mysticism. The Golden child, who is one in a line of divine Lamas and upon his compassion and grace the fate of the world rests, is a delightful and charming kid. The lady who identifies Eddie Murphy as the Chosen One is cute. Charles Dance, who plays as the wicked ""Sardun Numspa"", performs his role with expertise.

In this film, Eddie Murphy looks more serious than usual and the swearing and four letter words are much less. Eddie Murphy fans will enjoy his usual cute jokes. Viewers will also enjoy many visual appealing scenes.

This is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies. This amusing and mysterious movie is well worth watching. This is recommended viewing for those who love comedy and adventure and do not mind the weird and supernatural.",1143072000,19,1366,4.829059829059829

First, Murphy does his very best with a somewhat weak script and poor special effects.  His dialogue interfaces with Victor Wong (the Old Man) are very funny.  And the dream sequence with the splendid Charles Dance (as a very good Sardo Numspa) and Tex Cobb was well done.

Second, Charlotte Lewis looks great.  I don't need acting, I need a hotty in the film.  Check!

Third, ""I, I, I, I got the knife...""  Classic!

Fourth, it's simply fun camp.  Sit back, don't take it seriously, and enjoy.  The ending may be stupid as heck, but by then you won't care.",1135987200,4,804,4.374149659863946

Murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case. His assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled ""Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom"" since parts of this movie plays like a Spielbergian adventure, kinda like an Indiana Jones comedy. It's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun.

It has a certain quirkiness to it that reminded me of some Carpenter classics as Big Touble in Little China. Well, I recently bought a John Carpenter book and it said that he was actually going to direct the film at first but backed out. Well no wonder I like this picture.

Maybe it was the low low grade action. Maybe it was just the Forces of Evil surrounding me, but the truth is, i just couldn't bring myself to be able to like this film.
It is however not all bad, This is Eddie Murphy on vintage ""Trading Places"" style form, which is always worth the laugh, and there is one dream sequence which is so surreal its...well, surreal.
Despite this however, my suggestion would be to watch it on TV rather than buy it. it just aint worth the nuggets.",1082419200,,873,4.4625
1008805,3,6305310351,"There's something to be said about a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and for me, that's what makes this film work. The romance that almost works, the sometimes Indiana Jones characterization, the dry humor more reminiscent of Bill Murray -- all of these things push this film into mediocrity. It might be better, but it could be a whole lot worse. It has the ""feel"" of a 1930s/40s setting, more because of the alien settings (even in modern Los Angeles) and I have to wonder if some of this film didn't steal from Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China...
While others (especially the critics) panned this one, I suspect they were looking for another fast-talking, wise-cracking performance and that just isn't to be found in this interesting film. What we have is a more subdued and serious Eddy Murphy, but not taking himself too seriously, who is caught up in a very strange situation. Murphy plays the part with about the right mix of ""what's going on here"" and ""I think I'm still in control."" Give this one a chance and if you don't like it, well, it isn't for everyone.
But it is for me and comes in just above average...",1075075200,,1140,4.5931372549019605

1008809,2,6305310351,"Surreal. Action. Super-natural stuff. Comedy. Perhaps it is the eccentric mix that has confused and disappointed people. This movie strays extremely far from the ""realism"" of Beverly Hills Cop, 48 hours, Trading Places. The Golden Child reminds me very much of Big Trouble in Little China, in the way it mixes myth with action and humor. Altough to be honest there really is very litte action in The Golden Child. Eddie plays average guy thrust into a world he doesn't understand or really believe, and being that it is Eddie Murphy, there is humor to be found. This isn't his best movie or a ""great"" movie, perhaps the mix of so many elements leaves each one a bit too weak. Yes it is funny, but it is a far cry from a gut busting laugh fest. If you can appreaciate the ecentric mix of genres and are looking for a hidden gem that not all can ""get"", i highly recommend watching this movie. I only say watching since, after all, it is a Paramount release, ie, extremely high price for a bare bones, back cataloge, middle of the road movie. Shame on them.",1043971200,4,1054,4.466321243523316
1008810,3,6305310351,"Both funny and ridiculous.  Anyone who likes Eddie Murphy will not be disappointed, he is as funny as usual.  The silliest part in the film is when the chick is fighting and she happens to get wet, so the rest of the scene is basically a wet T-shirt show because she (of course) is not wearing a bra.  I mostly liked the movie because parts of it were actually filmed in Nepal, where I have spent some time, and it was nostalgic to see it again.  Some very visually appealing scenes and an interesting plot dispite being a bit nonsensical.  The actual golden child is cute and captivating.",1043625600,,589,4.416666666666667

7887256,3,6305310351,"The Golden Child(1986) is a guilty pleasure. It was emulated in Jackie Chan's The Medallion(2003)!!! There's some cheesy visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic!!! Eddie Murphy is funny in the film. We get to hear his 1980's slang from the time such as ""bad"" and ""kickin' figure"".
Eddie Murphy plays Chandler, a social worker who searches for missing children. The ""oatmeal scene"" did gross some people out. The drop dead gorgeous Charlotte Lewis is the female lead. Lewis is from the United Kingdom, yet she's been cast as a lot of ""Asian women"".  Lewis posed for Playboy Magazine in 1993. She played a ""Polynesian woman"" in Bare Essentials(1991). Charles Dance plays the movie's villain. Dance played  a doctor in Alien 3(1992). The ""golden child"" in the film is a boy played by a girl! John Barry was hired to write music for the film, but it was considered ""too lush"". The music in the theatrical version is mostly 1980's synthpop. The Golden Child feels like an Indiana Jones style supernatural adventure with Raymond Chandler style detective noir. Murphy was in Beverly Hills Cop 2 a year later. The Golden Child is a guilty pleasure from the mid 1980's.",1522886400,,1163,4.839195979899498
