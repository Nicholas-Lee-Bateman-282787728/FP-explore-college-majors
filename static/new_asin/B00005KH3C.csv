7943557,2,B00005KH3C,"I only got this because of Peter Cushing and Patrick Macnee two of my favorite actors but Blood Suckers is just one of those movies they put
known stars in a few scenes and the rest of movie has actors who can't act and a horrible script. Cushing is really not even in the movie! He has
one small scene not worth even a cameo mention! Macnee is in most of picture but doesn't help the movie as it's so boring and nothing to the story.
The second movie same just another cheap foreign badly written acted movie. save your money.",1476144000,,527,4.227722772277228

 Incense for the Damned (1970) or Blood Suckers (USA), is one of those odd English horror films you find at some rare store. Judging from the extremely bad reviews, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.

After a dreadful acid orgy with unpleasant ""Zoom ins"", I began to think that this film was not going to be typical. It's truly not very good but I found it unique in some ways and it rises above average barely. There were some really wonderful topless women complete with beautiful aureoles, including the main seductress, Imogen Hassall as Chriseis, who is pretty hot. The acting is passable, but the editing and fight scenes are hilarious since they are the old type, 4 on 1 guys who never get pounded or killed off. Patrick Macnee as Derek Longbow adds some class along with Peter Cushing, Edward Woodward.

Basically the lack of information regarding the vague seductress makes the film interesting and ambiguous. We are never sure as to what is going on. There's plenty of anti-establishment sentiments that make it seem like the elite academia (led by Peter Cushing as Dr. Walter Goodrich) are actually the ""Blood Suckers"".",1389571200,2,1191,4.881188118811881
7943559,3,B00005KH3C,"This is one of SWV's earlier releases and comes in that flimsy paper DVD box. The first title is 'Blood Suckers'[80mins/1972]. The story is about an Oxford student who disappears in Greece, get's a ""missing persons"" search party for him, and then weird things happen during the search. The title 'Blood Suckers' and the freaky cover art make this movie seem a lot more interesting than it is. The pace of the movie is slow with a ton of that archaic British acting.

Blood Thirst[72mins/1971] is a story about a series of grisly crimes occurring to young women in the Philippines. Then an American 'sex-crime' expert comes to Manila to lend his expertise. This movie is in b&w and features many Filipino actors of the day. Despite the title, there is not much gore or blood and the movie has the look and feel of something from the early 60's instead of 1971.

As always with SWV DVD's, there is a nice amount of extra material. First you get six Double Bill trailers(Blood Thirst/Blood Suckers[2:21],The Crawling Thing/Creature of Evil[1:45],Devil Woman/Dragons Never Die[3:23],The Embalmer/The She Beast[1:00],Night of the Witches/Dr. Frankenstein on Campus[1:00],Orgy of the Living Dead[2:04]).

Then you get three different sets of old Drive-in Intermission clips. These include ads for those wacky snack bars with the radio-active looking food and drinks along with announcements for upcoming shows/movies and reminders to return the drive-in speakers. There is also a Gallery of Drive-in Exploitation Art with Intermission Announcements.

This gallery features posters of exploitation movies along with ads for upcoming live shows including some spook shows of the day. The audio portion is from the Skyline Theater and features a ""cowboy"" sounding guy making announcements about contests, snack bar items to eat, new restrooms for customers, and upcoming shows/movies to enjoy.

Lastly there are two movie shorts. The first is 'The Horny Vampire'[12:52]. A pervy Vamp is stalking a young woman in a mini-skirt and somehow ends up in Downtown Las Vegas. She faints and he brings her back to his living room. Then suddenly she shows him a shlong sticking out and he bails. 'Midsummer Nightmare'[5:19] is a silent short with a spooky witch who turns into an attractive stripper. She does a striptease then vanishes.",1320019200,3,2319,5.173333333333333
7943560,2,B00005KH3C,"Something wierd can be counted on to find obscure horror  features and stick them out on dvd.  That's a good thing for sure.  In this case the prints are in not to great of shape.  These movies were a double bill back in the seventies and they were not as entertaining as many better 'bad horror"" flims of the day.  Still I welcome any old horror movie on dvd if the company releasing them will clean up the pictures.
When dealing with these type of films you always expect them to be low budget affairs and take what you get.  There is some fine actors in the first movie like Patrick Mcnee and others but the movie isn't really a vampire movie.  It's about a cult of blood sucking people and a weak minded drug using guy who falls under their influence.  The other movie is like alot of crazy Phillipine horror movies of that era, some fun and
alot of wierdness.  If you like low budget horror films and these are truly bad horror films then you may be amused by these movies.  But unlike some other low budget horror movies like 'Raw meat"" from the same era these aren't the most entertaining of bad horror movies to chose from.  Still I love bad horror so it was not too bad  a experience for me.",1225497600,2,1200,4.261061946902655
7943561,2,B00005KH3C,"This may be the most uninteresting DVD so far in the ever-growing Something Weird catalog.  Once again, a nice package and an authentic recreation of an actual double-bill...but these two movies [are bad]...(...)
First up is ""Blood Suckers"" which is about a young man, Patrick Mower,  who has become part of a satanic vampiric cult.  His friends and family are on a mission to rescue him.  Eventually they do.  But once back home, the man has turned a bit weird and now likes to suck blood.  Patrick McNee stars and Peter Cushing is in there too.  I remember renting this on VHS many years ago and it didn't leave much of an impression then.  It hasn't really gotten any better, but it is watchable and has it's moments.  The print used here has the pre-release title of ""Freedom Seeker"" on it --- now that's somthing weird.
Well, after one mediocre flick, I was looking forward to feature #2 which I had never seen (although I remember seeing photos of the monster(?) in old issues of Famous Monsters magazine....or maybe it just looks like a creature from the Outer Limits...I don't know).  Well, all I got to say is I now know why the 1965 filipino horror flick BLOOD THIRST took 6 years to find a release in the US on the bottom of this double bill.  Absolutely mind-numbingly dull from start to finish, this 73 minute b/w melodrama left this viewer in a comatose state.  Talk talk talk, blah blah blah.... and nothing happens.  And that monster mask is pretty damn fake (in the whole 1 minute of screen time you see it).  This one is just plain bad....not even good for laughs.
Something Weird DVD's are usually still a good buy because of the extras included, but here's a case where even those are mediocre.  We have several combo-trailers for other double features, none of them that interesting and one is incomplete.  There are 2 short subjects, both somewhat banal --- one about a ""horny vampire"" and the other an old witch nudie short.  There's the usual drive-in exploitation art gallery and it's the exact same line-up as another of a recent SW dvd release.  The audio spots on it are the best thing on this disc, though, as they are hilarious ""country-twang"" spots from ""Skyline Drive-In"" in Greenville back in the 70's.  This announcer is a hoot as he tries to peddle Zagnut Bars, Fanta Orange drinks and even Tab over the drive-in speaker system...  He also touts their concession stand as having the best food ANYWHERE and that their concession stand is ""World Famous"".  HAhahahahahhahaha!  Also remember to get your weight and age guessed at by two beautiful women...one of them wearing a turban!  Great stuff!  There were some more different audio spots from this particular drive-in on another recent SW disc... they are priceless.  I would rather have paid (...) for a disc just full of that stuff than these 2 mediocre movies.  So a disappointing disc overall, but if you gotta see 'em all......",1007251200,9,2918,4.68369351669941
7943562,5,B00005KH3C,"Blood Suckers is a truly insane film that will make you explode with mirth at wondering 'how can something so stupid possibly exist.' Just when you think viewing this will injure you, you're rescued by gratuitous vampirism and psychedelic party depictions. Some of the shots, for example Patrick Macnee riding a donkey and an uptight Peter Cushing representing the academic elite, will bring gut laughter. As a lover of pschotronic cinema and degenerate film, I recommend this as an example of meta cinema worth checking out every so often. To some, this outing may be too much of a bad thing, but to the converted, its well worthwhile.",1002067200,9,636,4.898148148148148
