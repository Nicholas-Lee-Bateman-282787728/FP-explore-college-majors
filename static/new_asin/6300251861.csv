7808096,3,6300251861,"STING OF THE DRAGON MASTERS (1973, aka WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES) stands out from the more formulaic martial arts movies of its time for a variety of reasons. It was shot in Korea and is set in the 1930s at a time when Japan occupied the country. Its emphasis is on Taekwondo and the cast includes Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Caucasian martial artists. The chief attraction for kung fu fans is the starring presence of 1970s kung fu queen Angela Mao who is featured in enough hard-hitting fight scenes to keep her many fans fully satisfied.
The plot has to do with the efforts of a Korean resistance group to get a list of its members to their contacts in Manchuria without the Japanese authorities intercepting it. The action culminates in a big battle with the Japanese at their headquarters in Manchuria. The cast includes future kung fu star Carter Wong (SHAOLIN TRAITOROUS, 18 BRONZEMEN) as a Korean Taekwondo student; Korean martial artist Jhoon Rhee as the leader of the resistance; and future kung fu star-director Sammo Hung as a Japanese villain.
The version currently available in the U.S. suffers from extremely poor English voice dubbing and a soundtrack of patched-together music cues that don't match the action and are slathered on indiscriminately, often drowning out the dialogue. Also, the full-frame transfer crops off much of the widescreen action.",1006646400,3,1368,5.004385964912281
