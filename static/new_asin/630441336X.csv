866680,3,630441336X,"I was mostly disappointed with this film, although I can't say it wasn't at least a bit entertaining.  Unlike most of Murray's films, this one does offer some family entertainment (most of his films are above the heads of kids, or rated R) and all in all it is after all Bill Murray and he is among the very best comedians to hit the big screen.  His brand of sarcastic and playing it straight comedy is always entertaining to watch, even if the film itself isn't the greatest.  A mild recommendation.",1005955200,5,501,4.483516483516484
866681,5,630441336X,"This was a funtastic movie. I just loved it. I have seen it several times and enjoy every bit of it. I even laugh just thinking about it. Bill Murray is such a funny actor, but it was great to see him in a good clean movie. The movie is wonderful for both kids and adults. Mathew McConaughey was hilarious as the high strung truck driver. Leonard Maltin doesn't know what he is talking about. I actually did not even know that it was McConaughey until I read the Maltin review. The scene with Bill Murray trying to drive the semi-truck brought tears to my eyes, I laughed so hard. I also really enjoyed the scenery in Colorado and New Mexico. If you are tired of the rubbish that Hollywood normally puts out and you want to see a great, clean, and fun movie, you must see larger than life. It is wonderful.",971568000,14,806,4.2745098039215685
866682,5,630441336X,"Bill Murray has the perfect sarcastic resignment at the beginning of the movie when he is suddenly surprised with an elephant that he has to care for! As the story goes on, he tries to find a way to get rid of the  unwanted burden, but the elephant starts to win him over and his goals  change to finding a way to give the elephant a happy life.  The bonus is,  that along the way, he finds himself, and discovers the spirit of the  father he never knew.  The most hilarious part was the crazy trucker, and  Bill Murray is funny the whole way through.  The sweetest part was Vera the  elephant and her thoughtful caring ways for the son of her beloved master.  I get so irritated when I see critics disparaging movies that I enjoy. I  never let their snobbish remarks stop me from trying a movie that sounds  good to me.  I recommend that you don't let Leonard Maltlin stop you from  trying this charming movie.",964483200,6,911,4.313609467455621

866843,5,630441336X,"Bill Murray is so hysterical with how he deals with Vera, the elephant he inherited.  It was heartwarming to see the bond that Bill and Vera developed as they dealt with challenges they encountered.
Some of the parts were a little too slap stick for my taste but not enough that I didn't want to stop watching.
It's an enjoyable movie that at least for me out me.",1515801600,,363,4.338235294117647

866851,4,630441336X,"This was a funny movie -- good to watch with kids. Only problem is one scene where a truck driver talk about how ""elephants do it"". This was inappropriate for little children. I don't understand why movies that would be perfect to watch with children have the occasional scene or dialogue that is not age appropriate. My little ones ignored that conversation. Otherwise it was an enjoyable movie with some uplifting messages. The scenes with the Southwestern Hispanic populations and the Native Americans, though brief, were particularly poignant.",1514073600,2,547,5.2272727272727275
866942,5,630441336X,"If you didn't like this movie, then you probably are not able to appreciate one of the world's most amazing animals - elephants. Everyone should experience a day with an elephant, and not necessarily in zoos where animals are confined, but in nature's preserves that are being created in greater number as we use our instinctive wisdom to care for the world. These creatures will delight and mystify you with their intelligence and ability to mesh with people. They are so smart and terribly abused by those who use them as entertainment venues. They love it when you ride on their shoulders which is the correct way and they will protect you with their lives.

Therefore with that said, I loved this movie - it opens the heart in every way. So cute, funny, sweet, and genuine to the character of the royal elephant - the movie, most of them, are lovable. Bill Murray is at his very best, warm, compassionate, earthy; you could tell he really loved working with this elephant - it was no act. This is a wonderful family movie that will warm the heart and give people faith in humanity. Highly recommend it.",1514073600,,1106,4.614213197969543

866944,3,630441336X,"Amazon has this movie listed as appropriate for kids.  I showed this to a middle school class, and there are a couple of conversations with sexual references that are inappropriate for this age group.  They laughed and enjoyed the movie and understood how the main character developed through the film.  Overall, it was okay, but I would not have selected it for them if I knew there about the dodgy references.",1513641600,,411,4.76056338028169

866950,3,630441336X,"Released in late 1996 and directed by Howard Franklin, ""Larger than Life"" is road movie/comedy/animal flick starring Bill Murray as a motivational speaker who receives a huge inheritance from his father whom he never met. It's not a fortune, however, but rather a female elephant named Vera. He decides to sell the pachyderm, but he must choose between selling Vera to a zookeeper in San Diego (Janeane Garofalo), who's offering $30,000, or to an attractive circus owner for $40,000 (Linda Fiorentino). As they trek across the country, Jack meets circus friends of his dad, a zany truck driver (Matthew McConaughey) and a village of Hispanics in need of a miracle. Keith David is on hand as a train conductor.

I love elephants, circuses and road movies; I also appreciate Murray's subdued brand of humor now and then. So I enjoy ""Larger than Life"" to some degree, but it's generally a missed opportunity because it could've been so much better. The plot's great, but the script needed a serious rewrite to realize its potential. That takes time and money, of course, which the producers unfortunately didn't want to spend.

The movie contains scene after scene that hold the promise of great entertainment, one way or another, but they're never milked for their potential. Take the Hispanic village segment, it comes and goes to little dramatic or comedic effect. Or take Fiorentino and her high wire babes: What we see of them is fine but they're never flushed out for their potential (and I'm not talking about raunch or nudity). Also consider the wacky truck driver with the mullet: He has the promise of being a great comedic side character, but he ends up just being over-the-top weird and inscrutable.

Still, there are several laughs & amusing moments and the road trip is entertaining to a point, which makes ""Larger than Life"" worthwhile for some.

The film runs 93 minutes and was in St. Louis, Missouri; Denver, Colorado; Moab, Utah; Wrightwood & San Jose Airport, California.

868016,4,630441336X,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

  I wonder what or who persuaded Bill Murray to sign onto ""Larger Than Life"" (hereafter ""LTL""). Perhaps the prospect of playing the cynically manipulative motivational speaker Jack Corcoran and satirizing all those ""How to Improve Your Life"" hucksters was a strong temptation.  But aside from the human pyramid Jack asks a group of participants to construct in order to prove trust in your fellow man, LTL certainly does not go that route.  Instead, the movie is a family-friendly, low-key comic misadventure Jack shares with a huge, unexpected inheritance from his late father - a 4-ton, female Indian elephant named Vera (Tai in real life) after his mother.  To his mild chagrin, Jack learns that his father was a circus clown who had a popular act with the highly talented Vera, who could do headstands, walk on her hind feet, and push a calliope among other stunts.  To his more shocked chagrin, Vera has caused roughly $35,000 worth of damage that Jack, as her new owner, cannot evade.

Therefore, Jack is of course desperate to unload Vera to the highest bidder as soon as possible, not only to pay the debt but also to get to a new speaking engagement on time.  He has two prospects: 1) Animal trainer Mo (Jaenane Garofalo) needs an extra elephant to complete an air transport of pachyderms to Sri Lanka for a wildlife preserve, and 2) Circus animal trainer Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino) needs an extra elephant for her act.  Both prospects are in California.  Jack is short on money.  Jack, at least at first, doesn't know how to command Vera to go, to stop, turn, etc. (he learns those whistled commands from his father's fellow circus performer ""Blockhead"" Vernon (Pat Hingle)).  This necessitates all of Jack's wiseguy wrangling and persuasive skills to find transportation a la ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" to get him and Vera to California (Actually, replace ""Automobiles"" with ""Trucks"" because, well, Vera of course won't fit in a regular car).

Thus, we get a reasonably amusing elephant/motivational speaker road trip that Walt Disney might have produced for his ""Wonderful World..."" program.  This means that although the beloved Bill Murray persona is present and he has some funny fast-talking lines, it's somewhat muted.  On top of that, Vera's mere presence steals the show.  Murray should have heeded W.C.'s warning against acting with children and animals.

For hard-core Murray fans, ""LTL"" will probably be an innocuous, fluffy disappointment unless they are willing to switch gears and accept it as an animal cross-country adventure.  If you ARE willing, or you like animals anyway, Vera will certainly not disappoint.  She might begin as a liability, but her size and her training become an asset as she and Murray confront junkyard dogs, highway cops, surly roadside diners, and whacked-out hillbilly trucker Tip Tucker (a highly animated Matthew McConaughey) who vengefully pursues the duo after Jack tricks him into giving him a lift.  Vera even comes to the aid of a flooded Hispanic village whose church is about to crumble.

Will Vera and Jack make it to California?  Is Vera destined for the circus or the game preserve?  Well, let's say that Vera is an entertaining creature who wins over even the harried, snarky Jack (and reveals a surprising rapport with Bill Murray, who seems to have been a good sport about interacting with this giant creature).  LTL also tells us a lot about elephants in general and respects and admires them.  Therefore, you'll probably figure out where LTL is going, and, like Jack, may even hate saying goodbye to ""large but jolly"" Vera.",1396828800,,3647,5.016611295681063

""Larger Than Life""
(MGM, 1996)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: mild spoilers below
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Murray stars (along with a very talented elephant) in this mostly kid-friendly comedy about an average guy who inherits a circus elephant from his long-lost dad. Working with the elephant as straight-man, Murray has some funny riffs, doing his uninhibited stream-of-consciousness schtick. The movie is okay and mostly okay for kids -- there's some mild profanity, topped off by a prolonged, unpleasant sequence where Murray and the pachyderm hitch a ride from an irritating, foul-mouthed redneck truckdriver (frantically played by an under-used Matthew McConaughey... I wound up fast-forwarding through this scene, to relieve my kid from the burden of remembering it later in life... Just not worth the brain space.)

There are two things that I thought were problematic with this script. The first was the unfortunate, lame stereotype of McConaughey's character -- ""dumb hicks"" being one of the last acceptable stereotypes in American culture -- and the other was the flatness and vagueness of the characters in general. Murray plays a motivational speaker who is vaguely dissatisfied with his life (the elephant helps bring his soul back to life) a caricature that might not resonate with many kids (or adults). Likewise, his nagging mom, his venal manager (Jeremy Piven, of course!) and the two animal trainers trying to get him to give them the elephant (Janeane Garofalo, saintly, and Linda Fiorentino, sexy and apparently evil) are all lacking in depth. I realize this is just a silly comedy, but the script still feels overly lax. It's a nice vehicle for Murray to do his thing, but the rest of the cast have very little to do, and give very little to the audience as a result.  My kid liked it, though: it was an okay movie -- there are lots better, and plenty that are worse. (Axton)",1355270400,3,2058,5.614147909967846

868183,4,630441336X,"Unless you are Bill Murray!  Clearly one of the most adaptable actors of his generation, this lovely film offers up a character at odds with himself, and you soon believe that he is the only one capable of pulling off the role. It's easy to see his predicaments, and the main one is large indeed.  Vera should have gotten a ""best supporting animal"" award, and Murray has freely admitted that their on-screen relationship was wonderful.  It shows.
Without going into all the encounters that Murray's character has to deal with, it is best to say that the most unforgettable person in this film is an uncredited Matthew McConaughey.  That he appears to be on the wrong side of nervous paranoia is an understatement, and that the target of his rage is just one simple step ahead of him...  One GIANT step!  Fun for the whole family, it deserved more of an audience than it got.

Which is too bad. For LARGER THAN LIFE is clearly an update and paraphrase of the period British novel ROSIE IS MY RELATIVE, written by the late naturalist Gerald Durrell. Though the episodes in the film are quite different from those in the book, the over-arcing story follows a similar trajectory and retains the air of eccentric sweetness. In England, where Durrell was the famous author of several bestsellers (most prominently his autobiographies, which were dramatised for TV), ROSIE IS MY RELATIVE is something of a cult classic.

To Murray's credit he does not phone his performance in but his droll sarcastic style that he does so effortlessly would make it appear so.  Interesting supporting cast here includes Lois Smith, Keith David, and Pat Hingle.  To the film's detriment Linda Fiorentino, an immensely talented actress, is wasted in a small role.

868250,5,630441336X,"If you ever felt like dancing in the street with an elephant this would be the movie to do it to. Although there is no dancing in this movie, the music fits within each scene perfectly. Larger Than Life is a movie for the entire family to watch more than once.

The title is the first line to two songs in the movie and I liked them both and they seem to tell the whole story to the movie.

Larger Than Life starts off at the 34th Annual Upholstery Convention with the introduction of the key note speaker, Jack Corcoran, the author of Get Over It. While Jack is pacing back and forth planning his speech, he receives a phone call from his mother. This becomes a pattern in the movie.

Bill Murray gives an outstanding performance as Jack. The speech begins with a story about how Jack's father saved a child and died in the process. His book Get Over It is his way of sharing things he found out about himself. There is a funny bit in the room where the members at the convention are involved in climbing on top of each other in a pyramid.

Jack arrives at the lawyer's office ready to claim his fortune. What happens next is he receives a trunk and is told of his fathers heart attack while performing. Turns out Dad was a circus clown and the elephant appears in the office. Jack then learns of the amount due to the lawyer for damages incurred by the elephant, $35,000. Jack leaves and tells them they will be hearing from his Mother.

The scenes are of Jack and the elephant walking through the town and all the citizens staring at them. A young boy on a bicycle tells Jack of how he looks just like his Father. He tells Jack about whistling to communicate with the elephant. They continue walking until they end up in the cemetery and there is the grave of his Father. The elephant seems to know this as well. Then the police car arrives and the lawyer is sitting there telling Jack he has 14 days to come up with the money or go to jail.

The music in the movie is by Los Lobos, Curtis Wright and The Staple Singers. The credits mentioned working with the American Humane Association and USDA Forest Service.

There are parts to this movie that my children are not interested in, they watch for the elephant scenes. I thoroughly enjoy Larger Than Life and spend most of the time laughing at the comedic scenes that Bill Murray seems to enjoy playing. The way the elephant responds to him is a nice touch and you can tell they became friends in the movie.

This is a great family movie for a Sunday afternoon, or a nighttime flick for the whole gang after dinner. The music lifts my spirits and I felt sad and happy at the end of the movie when Vera went on the jet.",1099612800,5,2672,4.287698412698413
868251,4,630441336X,"Larger Than Life is a fun (and sadly forgotten) little family flick that everyone can enjoy. Im 16 and I was chuckling all throughout by the likes of Bill Murray and Matthew McConaughey who are essentially the heart and soul of this kiddie adventure. The plot is a bit more advanced than most youthful ventures, and revolves around the escapades of sarcastic motivational speaker Jack Corcoran (Bill Murray), who receives a rather large inheritance from his estranged father and unknowingly gets a suitcase full of clown supplies and a large elephant named Vera. Deep in debt and eager to lose the new burden placed on his hands, Jack goes cross-country hoping to strike up a deal in which he can get Vera off his hands and make a little cash on the side. This, of course, goes awry and moral dilemmas lie in wait as Jack comes across floods, a paranoid hitchhiker played superbly by Matthew McConaughey going by the name Tip Tucker babbling about corrupt cops and conspiracies in motion by Big Brother, hijacking semi trucks, and half a dozen other little slapstick moments that should have the kids giggling. Larger Than Life is a simpleminded comedy aimed for the adolescent audience and though a few crude jokes are disguised by adult talk and should be over most of their heads, should be one that will provide the young ones with 93 minutes of fun and constant laughs from Murrays comical antics while still remaining family friendly and appropriate.
As for the disc, for one, you can expect Larger Than Life to be next to bare bones since its another nail in MGMs budget title catalog and the demanding MSRP is reasonable, and secondly, its a kiddie flick and therefore features are not a top priority, and three, the films next to pitiful $8 Million box office haul doesnt help either. That said, there is the obligatory Trailer presented in a widescreen format. Nothing special there. No booklet as usual. And since this is still an adolescent adventure, MGM gave us a bland full-frame presentation that is a tad bit above VHS quality. The picture quality is simple, faded, and bland. Nothing really stands out as a nice transfer would have and things remain in a neutral setting whether bright or dark, never adjusting quality with a change of atmosphere. And since there is really no sound effects and dramatic explosions to show off, the Stereo Surround mix is rather bland. Oh, and in addition to the less than par picture and sound quality we get a bland little promo for a dozen or so other MGM family budget titles.
The reason I give Larger Than Life a four star rating is because as a film I enjoyed it, Murray was flawless and his sarcastic humor never let me down, plus the fabulous cameo by McConaughey didn't hurt. But as a DVD, its a toss up. MGM put no effort into the release and starved the flick of anything other than a Trailer. Yet on the other hand, the film is meant for the kids and there is not a demand for deleted scenes or commentaries among the target audience plus the low MSRP keeps Larger Than Life in reason. If you are looking for an affordable family fun title that the kids will get a kick out of then by all means go for Larger Than Life, and for those who are fans of Murrays relentless sarcastic antics, but those who are looking for a full fledged feature filled disc (which I doubt there are more than a dozen or so including myself) should steer clear. Larger Than Life is a fun kids flick that the whole family can sit back and enjoy, and for the budget its a full fledged value. Thanks for reading my rather lengthy review of Larger Than Life; I hope it helps in your decision.",1054771200,17,3628,4.565950920245399

The people were trying to keep the church, and I'm presuming Idol Worship. This bothered my Conscious. I know the truth about Idols. I just need entertainment without Idol Worship, Religion, etc. It's so hard finding movies that are just clean. Clean spiritually in Jehovah eyes.

Also, it's just darling to see him interacting with this elephant - who is a goodhearted goof, herself. Pretty cheesy film, but it's a decent laugh and feel-good classic.",1516406400,,352,5.086206896551724
