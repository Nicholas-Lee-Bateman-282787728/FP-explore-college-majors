809869,4,6304209584,"With the exception for the abrupt and somehow rushed and unsatisfying ending, ""Magician"" is a typical (in a good sense of the word) Bergman's film that I liked a lot. I would call it ""The Tortured Soul of an Artist or Smiles of a Summer Night meets Hour of the Wolf."" I did not know what to expect from the film and was pleasantly surprised by an interesting story; impressive (especially in the earlier scenes in the woods) black and white cinematography; perfect blend of humor, intense drama, and mystery. Acting was perfect - not a big surprise with the cast like that: Max von Sydow, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Bjrnstrand, Bibi Andersson, and Erland Josephson. I'd like to mention Naima Wifstrand as Granny Vogler - what a great actress and what a character - she stepped out from the pages of the fairy tales, the old witch, wise and powerful; she also provides many comical scenes.",1156896000,10,883,4.666666666666667
809870,5,6304209584,"The correct title of this film is The Face. Since it partly deals with the way that artistic truth has to be packaged and promoted by hucksters it is not surprising that whoever distributed it in the US monkeyed around with Bergman's original title. More surprising is that an exceptionally stimulating, well-directed, well-written and finely acted work like this has only collected 3 Amazon reviews in the last 5 years. The actor's trade is here presented as closely akin to religion. Does the miraculous actually happen? Has it ever happened, even if only just once? Pleasure in art requires a suspension of disbelief: anyone, therefore, who has enjoyed a story, a picture, a film, has replaced reason with faith --- if only for an hour or so. There are certainly some people, entire sects of the puritanically minded (including groups of scientists, rationalists, and so on) who hate art, presumably seeing it as inherently fraudulent. At the same time, as Holly Hunter has remarked, actors are only beggars and gypsies; beyond the bounds of respectable society. When this theatrical tale ends the god appears from the machine, nevertheless, and the suggestion is that miracles do occasionally happen. Anyone at all interested in this subject owes it to him/herself to see this subtle film, by an acknowledged master of the medium, and one of the greatest of the C20th.",1125187200,26,1372,5.021929824561403
809871,3,6304209584,"Ingmar Bergman's film ""Ansiktet"" (translated as ""The Magician"") is about a group of travelling magicians in nineteenth-century Sweden. They go from town to town and put on a show involving various magic tricks; they also sell quack medicines to gullible people, thus incurring the wrath of authorities in Denmark as well as Sweden. When the film begins, they're trying to get to their next performance when they're apprehended in some town. It appears that the local prefect and his wife made a bet with their friend Dr. Vergerus on the subject of whether or not magic really exists, and they agreed to decide this issue by having the magicians perform for them. Because the local police inspector is also their friend, they get to force the magicians to stay in the town overnight, against their will.

This innocuous little plot quickly turns dramatic, thanks to Dr. Vergerus, who exhibits such grotesque extremes of malice toward the magicians that he enters comic-book villain territory. During the first scene he appears in, he threatens the magician Vogler with prison time (he knows that the magicians are in trouble with the law), accuses him of lying, literally pries his mouth open to look at his vocal cords, and proclaims that he would like to dissect Vogler in an anatomical theatre. What a guy! Later, we see him putting the moves on Vogler's wife, so we know that he's a dirty old man in addition to being a cruel sadist, and later still, he loudly ridicules the magicians while they're forced to go through their act. Then, an unemployed actor who met the magicians on their way to town dies of alcohol poisoning, and the magicians dress him in Vogler's clothes; Vergerus takes him for Vogler, and proceeds to dissect his body, as he threatened to do. Just in case we hadn't been assured of his total repulsiveness by that point, when he finds out that he had been tricked, he first orders the magicians to leave without compensation for their time, forcing them to beg for money, then throws one coin of low value on the floor in front of Vogler, forcing the magician to get on his knees to pick it up.

Now, I can see how a highly educated man of reason, a man who lives by the scientific method, might view the travelling magicians with some disdain, on the grounds that they make their living by taking advantage of ignorant people's superstitions. But Dr. Vergerus has no problem with this; on the contrary, his greatest fear is that the magicians really do have supernatural powers. When he sees that their act is a fraud, he is clearly relieved. He constantly tells the officials about how he doesn't believe in magic, and repeats this so often and so insistently that it's pretty clear that he's lying. What are we to make of this?

Well, Vergerus seems to be Bergman's symbol for atheism. When the doctor flaunts his disbelief before his rich friends, he states that he refuses to believe in magic because society would perish if magic were to exist (I'm not sure why), and then equates the existence of magic with the existence of god. The connection to religion is not even implied, but stated outright by the director. Bergman also seems to be equating science with atheism, by playing up Vergerus' scientific background, and having the doctor glorify ""reason"" and conduct dissections ""in the name of science."" So, Bergman's message seems to be that science and atheism, which are one and the same, are arrogant, because they deny the existence of god, and dishonest, because they are secretly afraid that god does exist, and malicious, because they seek to stamp out all those who call their authority into question. Unfortunately, Bergman makes Vergerus so hateful, and piles so many vices onto his character, that the film is manipulative, and thus unconvincing, in making this argument. More than that, the magicians themselves are hardly blameless: in their retaliation against Vergerus, they drive a hired hand to suicide, even though he hadn't really done anything bad, whereas even Vergerus doesn't succeed in killing anybody.

But overall, the film is not as grim as all that. After receiving the initial ultimatum from Vergerus and the officials, the magicians settle down for the night in the officials' household. In several ensuing scenes, the different members of the troupe meet the servants of the household, who are more superstitious and less cynical than their masters, and thus more susceptible to the magicians' illusions. First, Tubal the magician cons a young servant into buying a fraudulent, and apparently very bad-tasting, love potion. With this potential rival out of the way, Simson, the youngest member of the troupe, macks on a pretty servant girl and ends up having quite a fun time with her in a laundry basket. Meanwhile, the old woman, claiming to be a powerful witch, assures another servant girl of a happy future. These scenes are all very entertaining and cleverly written; anyone who's seen ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" knows how funny Bergman can be, when he wants to. The scene with Simson, when he brags to the girl about his romantic conquests, then gets weak in the knees when the time comes to prove his prowess, is absolutely hilarious.

So, the film isn't all bad by any means. All the actors are good, especially the one playing the charming con man Tubal. Even Vergerus is played just about as well as possible (by Gunnar Bjornstrand, a recurring face in Bergman films). The second half of the film, where Bergman's message is contained, seems disjoint from the first, which is much lighter and far more enjoyable. Nonetheless, the ultimate effect is not a good one.",1111017600,3,5642,4.854620976116303
809872,5,6304209584,"Ingmar Bergman's best films give the viewer the feeling of participating in a rite.  Its rhythms are less those of conventional narrative, than of theatre or a religious procession, say.  As with rites, the appeal is not to the viewer's intellect; their effect is both sensual and spiritual, troubling precisely because we can't put our finger on that appeal.
Of course, this requires a kind of faith, and is open to charges of manipulation, precisely the theme of 'The Magician', a splendid slice of unnerving Grand Guignol horror, where a rather academic argument between the Enlightenment values of sceince, reason and empiricism confront those of superstition, magic and the inexplicable.  These latter values might be called medieval, pre-Renaissance, and we are reminded that the modern theatre developed in this period from the Church, from rites and passion plays.  this is the kind of effect 'The Magician' has, visually and tonally.
The argument is not between the doctor and the mesmerist, but between the film's surface narrative (which, as an argument, promotes the predominance of reason) and the film's form (which destroys every attempt at argument).  Everything within the film that seems to derive from supernatural forces can all be ascribed, more or less, to rational causes, for example psychological weakness; even if it is this very weakness, that border between what we know and what we can't know, in which the mesmerist exists.  Although we might say 'Ah, it's only a delusion', the very fact that these self-generated delusions can convincingly take the place of safe, everyday reality, can become that reality, suggests the limits of rationality, without any recourse to the supernatural.
The shams of actors, con-men, misanthropes pretending to be mute, women pretending to be men might all be illusions which, once exposed, can restore the status quo; but once the idea has been suggested that a boundary can be crossed, that an illusion can be real, than a system based on those boundaries is undermined.
In a film where actors pretend to be what they're not, whose narrative proceeds like theatre and climaxes with a theatrical spectacle, Bergman's technique can be called a charade - e.g. the haunting trip through an eerie forest, the fog streaming in the sunlight like a magical gateway; the terrifying attack on the doctor in a surrealist attic, are all an illusion to give us a sensation, but they also undeniably reveal a world for us that lives with us and which we never acknowledge.  As ever with Bergman, it is only with acting, deception and illusion, not ational argument and empirical evidence, that we can even begin to approach the truth.",1002240000,38,2685,5.088636363636364
809873,5,6304209584,"I enjoyed this film immensely.  I discovered this film by accident, yet I was surprised by Bergman's visual intensity and sly metaphor.  Where one filmmaker might tell a simple tale of a magician maligned by suspicious  citizens, Bergman takes this idea further.  His is the story of a  visionary, who having first gained the favor of a town, is later reviled  for awakening their self-awareness. And, when the man is cast from town,  seemingly as a penniless drifter, he creates his best illusion of all.  Bergman is well-known for his use of relgious metaphor, and this film  attests to his genius.  I won't offer my conclusions, but leave this  discovery to the pleasure of the viewer.",947030400,9,688,4.844827586206897
809930,5,6304209584,Incredible cinema by Bergman.  Much cleaner presentation than old VHS tape version.  Plastic case was damaged however.,1453852800,,118,5.882352941176471
809931,4,6304209584,"This is a comedy, but it isn't difficult to see that it could have been a much more light-hearted movie than it turns out to be.  What makes it dark is the brooding presence of Vogler, the magician (Max von Sydow), who seems unusually threatened by the awareness that his audiences are becoming less responsive to the tricks of his trade -- seeing them, in effect, as trickery rather than magic -- and who will face an antagonist in the rational royal medical man Dr. Vergerus (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who seems to want it understood that Vogler's magic is mere trickery and who is willing to hold him up to public humiliation if necessary.  In this Criterion issue, the critic Peter Cowie -- and Bergman himself, in an extract from his autobiography included in the accompanying booklet -- make it clear that Vogler's anxieties reflected Bergman's own in the 1950s, when he felt that his efforts as a theater director in Malmo (1952-59) were not appreciated.  The larger issue, surely, however, is Bergman's consciousness that ANY art, looked at in a certain way, can be seen to be just a matter of trickery or technique.  Even poetry, with a cold eye cast upon it, can be dismissed as, or reduced (in an unsympathetic critical view) to mere rhetoric.  But if one takes the effect of art -- to awaken a sense of wonder, let's say -- rather than its means as what's important, then one can see how destructive a ""rationally"" reductive analysis can be, for it suggests to the audience that it's all ""just a trick.""  Vogler IS a faker, but he knows that his fakery has a value, so Vergerus's challenge is a matter of great importance to him, for reasons that go beyond ego-satisfaction or the making of a living.

I see Vogler as a true believer in wonder, and most of the other characters in the film are at least open to it, except for Vergerus, and he has to be taught that illusions have power.  The lesson is duly given -- I won't give away the details of how this is managed -- but by the end there's still a question of whether or not the lesson has ""taken"" . . .  But at least (I don't think it's going too far to say) Vogler is still in business at the end.

It's an enjoyable movie, but maybe a little too obviously schematic and allegorical.  For all that, it's effectively filmed, in good-looking, and appropriate black-and-white, with appropriately creepy effects.  Von Sydow and Bjornstrand are just fine as the central figures, but Naimi Wifstrand as Vogler's grandmother almost steals the show, and Bengt Ekerot (as the dying actor Spegel) and the lovely Bibi Andersson make impressions too.  It's hard to take Vogler as seriously as he takes himself with all the other shenanigans going on, and that, as much as anything, contributes to the sense that the movie is, after all, a comedy.",1448582400,2,2797,4.603621730382294

809980,4,6304209584,"After much consideration i purchased a copy of Bergman's The Magician. The plot as well as the cover art and stills had me highly intrigued. While this film did not disappoint in terms of pure entertainment I'm not so certain I would classify it as a masterpiece. Not quite as good as the Seventh Seal yet far better than Hour of the Wolf, the Magician has a charm and allure of it's own. The pacing was excellent for the subject matter and the mood of the piece was truly enhanced by the handsome cinematography seen throughout. As expected the characters were well developed and the dialogue was both engaging and amusing, simultaneously serious and lighthearted. Bergman covers themes which have become staples of his work and asks the viewer not to take sides but to consider the possibilities of the extra ordinary. All in all a blu-ray well worth owning or at the least worth seeing.",1374192000,3,889,4.705128205128205
809981,5,6304209584,"Made after the successes of Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"", ""The Seventh Seal"", and ""Wild Strawberries"", this film often gets overlooked. On the foreground, it looks like a simple little picture about deceit and misdirection; though with a closer look, this curious entry in the director's canon is ultimately a metaphor on Bergman's own artistic struggles. Because of its darker themes, the comedic elements of the film usually get overlooked. Featuring cast of Bergman regulars, including Max von Sydow, and some truly gorgeous cinematography, ""The Magician"" is a film that deserves a second look.

The DVD itself is a wonderful package, featuring a few Bergman interviews (one of which is in English), a visual essay by Bergman scholar Peter Cowie, an improved digital transfer for the film, beautiful English subtitle translation, and a booklet featuring an essay by Geoff Andrew.

I love a movie when I really have no idea how the plot will unfold.

809986,4,6304209584,"Original title: The Face.  It actually makes more sense than 'The Magician', but we get the point.  In this film with several Bergman regular actors, we are treated to quite a jest.  The jest here is that Bergman made this film as a slap in the face to his critics.  Bergman was always seriously affected when critics would negatively review his films, and most of the time he wouldn't even re-watch his films once they were cut (all of these statements confirmed according to his film autobiography - Images: A Life in Film.)  There was actually one critic in particular who was married to one of his regular actresses that this was intended to parody.

Knowing this, the film actually takes on an extra little element of complexity.  Rather than be struck by the obvious message of 'who am I?' it adds the 'who do you think I am? - You don't know!'.  In this story, a traveling troupe of actors go from place to place putting on a 'magic' show.  A skeptical group of prominent townspeople invite their troupe for a performance to 'screen' them before allowing them to put on public shows.  Enter the three critics.

Max Von Sydow is very good as the grim and silent Vogler.  Ingrid Thulin is also wonderful as the androgynous 'Manda' Vogler.  One of my favorite recurring Bergman actors, Gunnar Bjrnstrand plays Dr. Vergerus, Minister of Health, and the main antagonist to Vogler.  He wants to investigate Vogler, but in doing so wants to ridicule and humiliate him.  He challenges Vogler to incite any emotion from him in exchange for acceptance of his act and monetary recompense.  The groundwork is laid for a pretty memorable, yet slightly hokey scene in the attic involving Vergerus and Vogler.

The ending was somewhat surprising, and events along the way were also interesting and unexpected.  The line between reality and the spiritual is often blurred, but things seem to be explained through real life actions.  We see a couple of odd twists, such as the dying actor who wants to be Vogler's double.  His name translates to 'mirror', and though he doesn't resemble Vogler that much, it adds to the theme that people don't really pay attention to others.  In one scene Vergerus mistakes the deceased for Vogler despite the obviousness to the audience.  In another scene, Vogler removes his false hair and beard and tells Vergerus and the others that he is Vogler only to have them retort ""You're not Vogler, you don't even look like him.""  We also see another person in this film who dies mysteriously but is forgotten quickly by the others.  There is also a nice little side story with the other members of the troupe and the servants in the estate.  These scenes add a nice little bit of lightheartedness and comedy.  I especially enjoyed the 'love potion' scene as well as the scenes with the young braggart and the lusty maid.

In the end Bergman was able to throw the negative reviews from the critics back in their faces, much as Vogler is able to do to his critics in this film.  As a parallel to Bergman's early career, this film is wonderful.  The cinematography is very good, though Sven Nyquist was to take over that role in the next film.  I often preferred Gunnar Fischer's cinematography to Nyquist, especially in films such as 7th Seal and Wild Strawberries. This film being sandwiched between Wild Strawberries and The Virgin Spring does it no service.  Despite the film being wonderful in its own ways, the other two films tower as icons of classic film and rate among Bergman's best works (with Bergman himself preferring Wild Strawberries to most of his other films, except possibly Persona).  And fan favorite cinematographer Sven Nyquist was soon to make waves in Virgin Springs (which would win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film - Bergman's first).

In conclusion, this is a film overlooked often due to the more famous works preceding and succeeding it.  It may not rate with Bergman's best films in most people's opinions, but it is an important film in his catalog.  I would certainly say it is a must watch for any true Bergman fan.  For those not quite familiar with Bergman's films, I would definitely recommend starting with Smiles of a Summer Night, 7th Seal, or Summer with Monika.  This would be a decent place to start if the others are unavailable.  A nice Bergman film to watch in the middle of a Bergman marathon for sure.",1348876800,2,4366,4.718626155878468
809987,4,6304209584,"Occasionally, I've wondered what film-maker Ingmar Bergman
and I might talk about, were we to have dinner together.
It wouldn't be about film theory, or the silence of God;
it might, perhaps, be about our waiter being slow on the uptake
regarding our need for black, black coffee, or about those northern
icebound forests haunted by...what?

I know I would be tongue-tied; for, of all the films Mr. Bergman
has directed, only four come to mind which made a definite impact
on me: WILD STRAWBERRIES (about age and memory); THE VIRGIN SPRING
(about the persistence of faith); THE SEVENTH SEAL (about life and
death); and THE MAGICIAN.

I've never forgotten THE MAGICIAN.  In its own way, it is an
exploration of mysticism battling crushing cynicism.  Max Von
Sydow plays voiceless down-at-the-heels hypnotist-charlatan who
brings his starving troupe to a nobleman's mansion.  There he is forced
to put on a show which discomfits some and angers many.  Bergman
patiently explores illusion, and whether this defeated
charlatan may indeed have a ""power.""

At the climax, Bergman sets up a genuinely spooky attic
sequence in which von Sydow's main tormentor comes face to face
with his own fears, and the horror of the prisoning darkness around him.
It is disturbing, unsettling.

So how does THE MAGICIAN end?  Obliquely, in typical Bergman fashion,
providing no answers.
Like Bergman, it is a gothic entity each one of us - seduced by a master -
must approach with trepidation.

Criterion's print is gorgeous, a mosaic of lush darkness and light.
That attic brims with silence and unseen movement; one is so absorbed with
what is going to happen, life beyond the screen almost ceases.

film, and (of course) Bergman's metaphysical musings.

A band of traveling magicians, wanted by the law as charlatans, are
pulled in for questioning and forced to perform for some upper class
non-believers. The 'nothing-in-life is-what-it- seems' theme is strong,
but does get repetitive, and at times you can see it coming.

Also, on first viewing the elements didn't really feel like they fit
together, and I found it a bit of a bumpy ride. The comedy made the
dark side hard to take seriously, and the serious, creepy elements made
the comedy feel all the more wedged in.

810039,4,6304209584,"I picked up the Magician along with the Seventh Seal so I could have a Bergman double feature a while back. I was quite engaged by what in Swedish translates to ""the Face'. The Magician is indeed funny and while not scary did have a few moments where I couldn't wait to see what happened next.

Max Von Sydow is the title character and he is in disguise throughout the picture so this is not seminal Von Sydow. Gunnar Bjonrstrand, as the antagonistic Dr. Vegerus, really dominates the screen here. It is his performance that really provides the films skeptical perspective. I'd even go so far to say that whatever title you choose to call this film, The Magician or The Face, they are probably the derisive descriptions Bjornstrand is using in his inner-dialogue to size-up the Von Sydow character. The Vergerus character would continue to pop in Bergaman's films in different guises and I have to imagine because it is so successfully done here.

The Criterion extras are not up to par with the Seventh Seal. There is a brief video essay from Peter Cowie who is always execellent and his take on the film isn't congruent with mine (I think he sees Von Sydow as the main character). There is not much else in the way of extras but the transfer is great even on DVD.",1323043200,4,1265,4.543859649122807
810040,4,6304209584,"A travelling magic show is detained by local authorities who seek to verify whether the mysteries they perform, and the healing they offer, are genuine or merely the tricks of charlatans.  Max von Sydow plays the magician, at once fiercely proud and conflicted.  He knows the power he wields over weak minds, and is yet deeply troubled that he lacks the wisdom he professes.  Still, his pride wins out when he employs his wits to wipe the smug grin off of the face of the doctor who believes there is a scientific explanation for everything.

The themes of the film should be familiar to those who've seen any of Bergman's early films - the pain and joy of love, the tension between art and artifice, and between art and entertainment, the possibility of knowledge and the question whether there can be knowledge beyond the mundane (such as the fact, as Tubal points out here, that wherever you go your face is in front and your rump behind you), the significance of death and the meaning of life.  It is equally an examination of the fear of the unknown, and the comedy of the all-too-familiar games people play, and Bergman here achieves an ideal blend of the serious and the comic.

Here, though, the questions are posed more directly than elsewhere on the question how an artist who explores such themes in his work is received and whether that reception is just.  The magician Vogler is here a fairly obvious stand in for the director Ingmar Bergman, and his self-imposed silence suggests a desire at least that he would not be expected to explain or defend his work.  Peter Cowie's very lucid and engaging video essay, included in this set, develops in some detail an interpretation of this film as a response on the part of Bergman to his critical reception in Sweden.

I remember seeing this on a bad print in the theater several years ago, and again on a grainy VHS tape, but neither experience prepared me for the crisp black and white imagery on this disc that looks as if it has not aged a bit.

810041,4,6304209584,"I bought this film never having seen a Bergman film before... I don't think, and wondered if I'd appreciate it on its own merits rather than for being a ""BERGMAN"" film.  The opening is depressing enough and I almost turned it off but was soon drawn in by the quality of story telling, acting and film making. I wasn't struck or impressed by the genius behind the curtain but by the newness of the film. It also has common sense woven in with tragedy, comedy and vindication. I also enjoyed the extra interviews with Bergman. His story of an oriental pedestal maker struck a truth for me that I needed at the moment. I couldn't believe how appropriate it was for me and Bergman looking right into the camera (at the viewer) while telling it.  I realized then how he loved story telling and film making of course far beyond being 'Bergman' whom I prejudged as being out of reach and out of touch with his audience only because of his persona.  Now I have to get my hands on all of his films but where to start (?).

  The movie is set in what feels like nineteenth century Eastern Europe.  The film opens with the band of entertainers taking a break on a hill beside their horse drawn carriage. They still wear makeup and period clothing as if not having time to remove them since their last performance or are they on the run? Is the make up so bad in this movie? This type of question runs to deeper and deeper levels but all at a digestible pace. Truth seems to be in question much of the time but doesn't seem to suffer never surfacing especially at the end. Some parts remain unresolved but this also seems of little consequence as in real life. Who can answer such questions - what is 'truth'?
There's more integrity in not attempting it and a reality is restored.  What does seem of consequence is the survival of integrity which has, as a finale, been evenly given to all the characters - or there would have been trouble. (Happy ending).",1308268800,3,1944,4.410614525139665

This is one I had never really seen before, and I'm kicking myself for not doing so earlier!  Bergman's motif in a lot of his films is the struggle between faith and reason (his father was a minister, and the director struggled with his belief throughout his lifetime).  You'll have to check IMDB to get a sterling film review, but as for the quality of the transfer, it looks sublime!",1295395200,,491,4.49438202247191
810044,5,6304209584,"Hemmed in by a dazzling series of successful movies (Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Winter Light), the Magician came and went in 1958 without much acclaim from moviegoers or critics.  Now remastered and rereleased by Criterion, and viewed from the longer perspective of Bergman's entire career, this rich broth of a film deserves a more prominent position in the Bergman canon.

According to Bergman, he made the Magician in reaction to critics who were negative towards his film and theater work of the late 50s.  He set the story in the 1840s and used a magician, Vogler, along with  his travelling troupe to stand in for the artist and artistic illusion.  This is in contrast to cold, scientific rationality, represented by Dr.  Vergerus,  and mindless bureaucratic power in the form of  Starbeck, the Chief of Police.  All of the major themes that informed Bergman's work are here: a preoccupation with dying, severe doubts about the efficacy of art and the artist, the silence of God and the vast abyss of ignorance and misunderstanding that humans must cross to connect with one another.  He uses a technique he employed frequently in his films, which is to center the action in a confined, even claustrophobic space, then rachet up the tension until the characters explode.

Vogler and his troupe have played to both acclaim and abuse across Europe.  They come to a small town  where the police drag them to the house of Consul Egerman, who claims to be a sympathetic fan of Vogler's magic.  His colleagues Vergerus and Starbeck  are much more skeptical.  Vogler and his tawdry troupe are a grab bag of stale tricks and tacky dissembling.  Vogler wears a wig and false beard.  His young male assistant turns out to be something else altogether.  His stage manager is a not very skilled con man.  Besides the big themes, there is a bawdy, comic  aspect to the film: Vogler's troupe, banished downstairs to the household kitchen,  try to con the female staff, who prove more than willing to be tricked.  The climax of the film occurs at the other end of the house, in the attic,  where Vogler and Vergerus battle for supremacy.

As was the case throughout his career, a story line that would otherwise be simply schematic is brought to life through Bergman's world class production skills: set design, costumes, lighting, props, camera work all contribute to that vivid dream Bergman was so brilliant at creating, even as he was skeptical of his own motives in doing so.  The terrific cast features Bergman stalwarts Max Von Sydow, Ehrland Josephson, Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin.  Naima Wifstrand, a regular in Bergman's theater troupe, milks the juicy role of Vogler's grandmother, a 200 year old witch who sells bogus magic potions to the Egerman household.  Gunnar Fischer's camera work is lush and fluent, creating layers of light and shadow that accentuate the creepy tone of the story, and then just as quickly pop us out of it, as though Bergman, slave to his own ambivalence, can't decide whether to spook us, provoke our intellect or make us laugh.  So he does all three.

 Criterion deserves credit for bringing this wonderful film back to our attention.  The disc also contains critical commentary by Bergman expert Peter Cowie and two brief interviews with the master himself.",1295049600,2,3300,4.9113924050632916
810045,5,6304209584,"The cinematic excellance of The Magician (1958) is appreciable if you put it into the context of Bergman's other earlier (relatively) films- The Virgin Spring, 1960, and Through a Glass Darkly, 1961, both of which won best foreign lanquage film academy awards (and both of which starred Max von Sydow and both of which were shot in black-and-white).  Bergman was beginning to understand that his films were enjoyed by more than just swedes, that he had some sort of universal appeal.  I think the reason for this is that Bergman was (is, to me,) one of those rare individuals who can remember his own dreams.  ""Well,"" you might say, ""that explains some of those slow moving sequences such as the opening scenes of the magician's troupe rolling into the misty swamp.""  But now think a minute.  What would it be like to have a magical act in one of your dreams? The answer is one of the most terrifying encounters ever filmed, yet it is always on the edge of black magic, always just a little bit short of pure evil.  The whole movie, all the little subplots, climax in this astonishing dream-magic.
  So buy it, my friend, (now that it's finally available on DVD in the U.S.) It's one of those films that you watch, and then every few weeks after you watch it again, and again.  Quality horror, with a seemingly impossible happy, even funny, ending.",1290556800,2,1348,4.630252100840337
810046,4,6304209584,"Ingmar Bergman's lesser-known 1958 film is on the surface a cleverly conceived battle of wits between a mid-nineteenth century traveling magician and a small hamlet's minister of health.  There's more than a mere contest of faith and reason within the larger tale of deception and manipulation.  For Bergman, there's a parallel sub-text that was close to his heart: the battle between critics and artists.

Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions who comes up against the rational minister of health Dr. Vergerus (Gunnar Bjornstrand).

Beautifully photographed in rich, velvety black and white, this fable is both funny and frightening from one of the masters of world cinema.

I finally saw it in the mid 1960's, and it became one of my favorites. I was overjoyed when Criterion Collection issued the DVD. Some critics have called ""The Magician"" lesser Bergman -- as in the case of ""The Devil's Eye"", I venture to disagree. It is a ""lighter"" film in some ways than a number of his others, but is beautifully acted, directed and photographed.

810069,4,6304209584,"An underrated film by the master Ingmar Bergman.  Part horror, part comedy, part erotic, part
symbolic...it is a movie that should generate a lot of thinking when it is over.

Ostensibly it is a movie about the continuing conflict between faith and science...or reason and art but there are no quick answers. The character of Dr. Vogler may have been influenced by the myth and fact of Rasputin. Even the look is similar;  Max Von Sydow is the ""perfect choice of actor"" in portraying this hypnotist, con-artist, or real magician.

I never had the sense that the ""magic"" was real, but persons behave as if the illusions were true.  After a cynical medical officer humiliates Dr. Vogler, attempts to prove Vogler is nothing but a charlatan, the magician challenges him for a private performance.  And in that performance Dr. Vogler dies and comes back to life again...the metaphor of Christ.

The nature of God requires us to keep on questioning.  This was a theme in ""The Seventh Seal' and it reappears in this film.  Recommended...not as a masterpiece but as an important work of the director.",1281139200,58,1093,4.833333333333333
810070,5,6304209584,"The Magician is a magical early 50's film from Bergman. He opposes, to the magic of Vogler's Magnetic Health Theatre, the cold rationalism of Dr. Vergerus and the other government officials, the chief of police and the consul. In 1846, the travelling troupe are on the run, and are heavily disguised. Ingrid Thulin acts as a male assistant to her husband, Dr. Vogler, who is himself, disguised behind a false hair and beard. They have a director of the Co. who sells their act to new customers. The old woman with them, a witch, sells love potions. Is Vogler a charlatan, or a man with supernatural powers? Vogler's face, in disguise, as a mute, is messianic. He represents to Vergerus ""what cannot be explained"". However science can penetrate all mysteries. Vogler and his troupe are submitted to questions in such a humiliating manner to unmask their fraud.

They have been invited to stay at the inn, where they are to perform. There are elements of fairy tale and horror show,ghosts, dying and dead actors. In one of the acts,the chief of police's wife, reveals he's a fraud. Another man, a driver, attempts to kill Vogler, to escape his power. Vogler enacts a terrible revenge on Dr. Vergerus. In this little allegory, Bergman was drawing on his theatrical experiences: the duality of artists in a closed world of illusions and the ambiguous relationship with the world outside. He had to beguile the audience. Film represented the longing for pure artistry(the dying actor expresses this). Bergman's true target was a film critic, married at the time to Thulin. This film is a perfect example of the best of his early work. Von Sydow's illusionist is related to the wordless actress Vogler (L.Ullman ) in Persona. A true gem.",1272326400,,1731,4.847972972972973

810072,3,6304209584,"The three films that Ingmar Bergman produced at the close of the 1950s -- DET SJUNDE INSEGLET, SMULTRONSTAELLET and JUNGFRUKAELLAN -- tower so high in his output that one might forget that these were not his only productions of the era. ANSIKTET (""The Face"", released in English-speaking markets as THE MAGICIAN) from 1958 is one of his lesser-known films.

In mid-19th century Sweden the magician Albert Emanuel Vogler (Max van Sydow) goes from town to town promising people cures for their ailments and performing magic tricks, including what was the sensation of the time, hypnosis. He is joined by his tout (Aake Fridell), his ""ward"" Mr. Aman (Ingrid Thulin) and his ""grandmother"" and the troupe's maker of patent medicine (Naima Wifstrand). After fleeing the law after a performance in one town, they pass through the forest and enter another community. Here they are detained by the authorities, so that the physician Vergerus (Gunnar Bjornstrand), the consul Egerman (Erland Josephson) can decide a wager on whether Vogler's tricks are real spiritual powers or scientifically explainable illusions.

While ANSIKTET should not be overlooked for fans of Bergman, I think it's fair that the film is not ranked among Bergman's greatest achievements. Characterization is pretty slim -- we get no idea of why Vogler and his companion chose this life, and Vergerus is so shallow that Gunnar Bjornstrand seems wasted. And had the film ended three minutes earlier it would have been one of Bergman's more powerful conclusions, but instead we get a completely unexpected happy ending that just seems lame. Much of the middle part of the film depends on sex jokes that are funny at times, but I suspect anyone who knows Bergman's great output will continuously be thinking that he's capable of so much more than this.

Still, ANSIKTET does have a generally thought-provoking dramatic arc, and some moments will prove memorable. I especially admired the battle between Vergerus and Vogler and the magician's breakdown (funny how his temperment appropriately changes with his clothes in this scene). It's a pity that Criterion hasn't released the film for the US market as Bergman's major films, but if you can view the UK import, it's worthwhile.",1271980800,6,2241,5.1510989010989015
810073,4,6304209584,"***1/2 1958. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Special Jury Prize in Venice. Albert Emanuel Vogler's company has just arrived in town. Before being allowed to give public performances, Vogler, an hypnotizer and a magician, must give a performance in front of the local authorities. THE MAGICIAN is a film about the artist's condition and, as a consequence, about Bergman himself. Vogler is, like a movie director, a manipulative person who plays with his public, a mute cog in the process of film making who only recovers his voice in order to convince producers to finance his project. In this perspective, THE MAGICIAN handles all the literary themes about illusions: the make-up, the dead man who's not dead after all, magic, love, transvestite characters and so on. While, in my opinion, the first scenes in the forest and the final duel between Dr. Vergerus and Vogler are little jewels of cinema, the scenes at the Egerman's are rather long and theatrical. At this moment, the mise en scene doesn't do justice to the high quality of the screenplay.

I saw one in which it was called (with no irony) ""semi-comic"".  That means, to me, ""not very funny.""  And it isn't.  The jokes are very poor indeed and revolve around busty serving wenches and conjuring tricks gone wrong: imagine Tommy Cooper in a bad Carry On film.

Well, unless Amazon are posting out heavily-edited versions, then I can only conclude that the reviewer should get out more.  Or maybe a rubber hand being animated by an assistant out-of-frame really IS gruesome, and I'm the twisted one...

810078,4,6304209584,"Ingmar Begman's The Magician (Ansiktet) is perhaps Bergman's most telling and autobiographical film deals with the subject of humiliation. It also gives Bergman's view on the place for magic and superstition in an increasingly modern world ruled by logic and science.

Max von Sydow gives a terrific performance as Volger a 19th century magician whose world is crumbling with the onset of modern logic. Volger and his wandering magic troupe have been chased out of Denmark and arrive in Sweden where they are the forced guests of Consul Egerman (Erland Josephson). Egerman has made a bet with the local health minister, Vergerus (Gunner Bjornstrand) and Chief of Police Starbeck that all things can be proven by science, that there is no longer a place in the world for magic and superstition. Over the course of a night and a startling performance the next day, Bergman proves that there may be a place yet for magic.

Winner of the Special Jury Prize at the 1959 Venice Film Festival the film features outstanding performances by von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin as the magicians cross dressing wife, Manda Volger. The film creates its own creepy feeling of suspense and the surprise ending leaves you thinking long into the night after seeing this ""thinking man's horror film.""
