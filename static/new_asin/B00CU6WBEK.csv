5741728,5,B00CU6WBEK,"Stalker girlfriend, evil cult, a serial killer, an insane vigilante, boy genius detective, international terrorist, kidnapping, murder, a mischievous imp, and the god of space and time are all key elements of this anime. This is probably the most insane anime since Code Geass. Plot twists are lurking around every corner, full of suspense. You can never expect the events in this anime, and when you think you have seen the craziest twist, another one will present itself to you later in that episode.

Deus ex Machina, the god of space and time, declares to abdicate his prestigious throne to one human, but he must find a worthy candidate. He gives twelve individuals a future diary, a device that predicts the holder's future. Whosoever survives this game of murder will ascend Deus ex Machina's lead as the god of space and time. The game is sort of like the theme of anime like Fate Stay Night or Eden of the East. Also note that if the diary holder's personal journal should be destroyed, the user will die as well. The specifics are all explained in the first episode, and the rules of this game are not really difficult to follow.

The main character of this anime is a middle school boy named Yukiteru Amano. He originally believed that he was the only one who can read the future, but is quickly proven wrong. As interesting as the plot is, the truly fascinating aspect is Yuki's stalker girlfriend, Yuno Gasai. She is a very unstable pink haired girl, who will do anything for Yuki. Her diary tells her about the future of Yuki in ten minute increments. It becomes disturbing when she knows exactly what he is doing at all times. She is also very skilled with knives, swords, axes, and anything else she happens to get her hands on. Her presence in this series is so frightening and unpredictable, that she becomes the true driving force of the anime. If she is not in the show for about 5 minutes, you start to miss her, even though she may be the most frightening and mentally unstable anime character ever.

Notably Funimation had a good time with this anime because the show is so insane, that they could write anything for the script that they wanted to, and that is fine. However, the English dub takes a lot of liberties, and the dub seems quite ""Americanized."" Just be careful if you are used to the original version, and then go to the English because the lingo is different.

Keep in mind that this DVD set is only for the first 13 episodes out of 26. Episode 13 does end on a cliffhanger, so it forces you to watch the second half immediately. The DVD does not have too many special features to speak of, but the limited edition set does come with 2 Valentine cards that are quite fitting for this show.

Overall, this is probably the most exciting anime I have seen in awhile. Death Note and Code Geass are probably the only other anime that can attempt the craziness and the tension that this series exhibits.",1381190400,6,2934,4.55977229601518
5741729,5,B00CU6WBEK,"The story is amazing and will keep you guessing until the end. I have seen over 250 different animes and this worked its way into my top 20 with ease. I you don't like blood, and strong language, then this my not be for you. However if you want something fresh and exciting, hands down go for this.",1379894400,5,298,4.155172413793103
5741730,3,B00CU6WBEK,"the anime future diary is one of my favorite, i watched it in English subbed, no this isn't an bashing on the dubbing. my problem with this show is the script. in the Japanese version yuno calls yukki, yuki, not my love, sugar, sweaty, or any other annoying nicknames. that is my biggest problem, also the meaning are gone, like when yuki says he want to see the stars with yuno, it has a big meaning in character development and they change it to ""i want to to go an a date with you"" the actual voiced acting in the show isn't that bad, the only problem really is that yuno sounds sane, which is ok. i subject watching it in Japanese with subs, which you can do with this.
 the DVD came with about 4 trailers, and some other boring extras.
 it also came with 2 Valentine cards
 all in all the show is awesome, just the director or writer for the english version are complete idiots.
 i suggest watching it, if your new for the show the script won't be a problem for you, in many ways it more 'american' like then the Japanese version, if you watched it subbed i still suggest buying this and trying it in English, you never know you might like it better, if not just watch it in Japanese.",1379808000,4,1189,4.224669603524229
5741731,5,B00CU6WBEK,"I was super excited when I heard this was coming to the US, and preordered it immediately. However, once I got it and began to watch, I was extremely embarrassed at how horrible the English voice acting is. Funimation really should have tried a little harder with finding the right actors. Anyone who has watched this with the Japanese dubbing may feel the same. The show itself is fantastic, filled with lots of suspense and a bunch of WTF's around every corner. But with the English acting, it really takes away from the seriousness and thrills. I highly recommend turning the Japanese audio on for a better experience.",1379721600,,621,4.7592592592592595
5741732,4,B00CU6WBEK,"Don't get me wrong, this anime had me interested the whole way, but there's so many questions that get unanswered (especially during the ending) and plot holes that make no sense that I couldn't give it a 5 star.
If you just want to know the synopsis and why the anime is good, read the other reviews, I'm just here to explain why it got a 4 star.
*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*

My first question is the concept of the future diaries isn't really explained. Some crazy guy proposed it and for some reason Deus accepted it - that's really all the anime says about it. No explanation of why Deus chose this as the medium to chose his successor or why he chose the people he did to join the game. I feel like this would be an important thing to include in the anime.

My next question is Yuki's sudden character change in the 18th, 19th episode, you'll see it when it comes. It's so sudden I thought the site I was using had forgotten to upload an episode. Yuki turns from a shy innocent boy to a killing machine that adores Yuno just like that with no explanations.

The whole ending is just a mess. It throws so many ideas out there, it ends up being a blob of confusion. I don't really get the whole dimension thing. At first it explained it as Yuno going back into the past to play the game again, and then later on it says those worlds are different dimensions. Is it the past she went into or a whole different dimension? You'll understand what I mean when you get to the end; you're just like ""what just happened?"". It's just so abrupt I couldn't like the ending.",1379635200,3,1558,4.274576271186441
5741733,5,B00CU6WBEK,"Bored of your love life? Tired of meek submissive girlfriends who always want to discuss their feelings? Then let me introduce you to Yuno Gasai! The girl whom cupid won't approach without wearing body armour; the girl whose love you absolutely cannot refuse. No commitment issues for this girl. She'll make your friends jealous and then deceased. She'll win over your parents and then slit their throats. She'll treat you like a king and then imprison you in her dungeon. She'll steal your heart and stuff it in a jar. She's crazy in bed and even crazier everywhere else. She can do things in the kitchen that'll pop your eyes out (literally). Her hobbies include stalking, texting, texting while stalking and hiding corpses. She likes amusement parks and homicide. She's got killer looks, deadlier instincts and the brains to match (which will come in handy when evading authorities). No act is too unethical or taboo for the sake of her man. She may be psycho but only for the sake of love. So if that's the kind of girl you're looking for then call now and get professional help!

Bravo anim! What a way to smash clichs! Girlfriends have been mostly shy mo doting creatures or tsunder types or aggressive combat experts. However, you could always tell whether they were the good guys or bad guys, whether to root for them or not. This show however defies that trend by giving the protagonist a heroine from whom he has as much to fear as to love. She is ""crazy about him"" quite literally. Only rarely is she a doting girlfriend. At other times a liability and at other times she is in ""full-on psycho mode"" and those are the times when she shines. Should Yuki stay with her or ditch her? That's what Yuki and the viewer will keep asking himself.

This show combines elements of Steins;Gate and Death Note but retains a distinct identity all of its own. Anim prominently features cell phones but this show takes their usage to a whole new level. Even the episode titles are references to cell phone features or functions. The Japanese sure do love their cell phones.

Unexpected plot twists and turns around every corner, crazy characters galore and awesome battles is what makes this show worthy of a five star rating.",1379548800,27,2222,4.6923076923076925
5741734,5,B00CU6WBEK,"Mirai Nikki, known in English as Future Diary, is one of my favorite stories of all time. You don't know me, so you don't know how big of a deal that truly is, but Future Diary is one of the most masterful expositions that I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying, and all the pieces fall perfectly in place to make it feel like a perfect present crafted just for me.

The plot synopsis by itself should be more than enough to get you interested if you are into survival game stories as it is undeniably one of the most original, and has the most potential. The rules are simple. There are 12 people who were manic diary keepers all competing in a game of last-man-standing with the prize being the throne of god. To make things interesting, god has given these people's diaries the ability to tell them the future as if their diary entries were already written. This makes for some truly nail biting battles as people are constantly trying to avoid death as they use whatever information their diaries can give them about the future to escape death, and exploit any lack of information of other people's diaries to pin them down and finish them off.

That is just the beginning however. Yuki, the first person to receive one of these future diaries, is rather timid and introverted. Most definitely not suited to playing a survival game, even though as an introvert he would fill his diary with whatever things he saw happen around him, making his diary the most broad and useful. So, he must team up with his psychotic stalker Yuno Gasai, who is the most enchantingly insane character that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Unlike Yuki, Yuno's killer instincts are razor sharp, and she has the brutality to follow through on it. However, Yuno's diary also leaves her incredibly vulnerable. As a crazy infatuated stalker, Yuno would only fill her diary with entries about Yuki, so her future diary will only give her updates as to what happens to him. This leads to a co-dependence to survive the game, and how their relationship develops is extremely unique and engaging.

The series thrives on mystery, action, and horror as the two teenagers struggle to make it out of each encounter still alive, and it kept me thoroughly engaged all the way to the very end, where some of the biggest plot twists this side of 999: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors.

If you are at all a fan of survival games, romance born out of darkness, or looking for an intense character study of a true ""yandere"" trope, Mirai Nikki is more than worth the pick-up. One of the best anime to come out in the last decade, this is most definitely not something you will want to miss.",1378857600,36,2658,4.542797494780793
5741735,5,B00CU6WBEK,"This is a great series. The fact that it's going to be dubbed, means more people will watch it. Also, if that were to happen, maybe there wll be another OVA :D <3",1373414400,4,162,3.9393939393939394
5741736,5,B00CU6WBEK,"I am only coming here to warn some people about this show.

When I heard the premise for this show, I immediately thought Death Note, but an even cooler concept! And, since I'm such a fan of Death Note, I knew I would love it!

Now, I know I will probably get a lot of backlash for some of these comments, but, I think that if you enter this series thinking its going to be as well thought out and dramatically engaging as Death Note, you will be disappointed. The magic of Death Note is in the chase. The guessing who is going to catch Light? and when?? With the Future Diaries being anonymous and the users hiding their identities, I figured Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) would follow that same premise... which was my downfall in the early stages of this show, and almost ruined the whole show for me. There is no chase. People just instinctively know the main character is an owner, which annoys me. They do explain how the first couple know, but past that it seems everyone just knows... and its just a wasted opportunity for some REALLY good suspense! I mean, I came into this thinking it would be 12 Lights and Ls mindf***ing each other!

But anyway, once I was able to push that dream aside, I was able to realize all the GOOD points of Mirai Nikki. There are some AWESOME characters in this. The main protagonist, while many would toss him aside as the usual weak boy character, has some very interesting qualities! Namely, his willingness to do anything to survive... and I mean, anything! And of course, there's the reason anyone watches this show. A girl named Yuno. An unreadable girl who you are never sure you can truly trust! It is worth watching this series just for her.

I hope you all give Future Diary a shot. I certainly will be picking up this title. I just wanted to make sure people don't go into watching this expecting that suspense that you expect with Death Note and end up not enjoying what is actually there. There is plenty of suspense, and dramatic happenings, but if you are caught up comparing it to Death Notes, you will probably miss the good points of this show!

Hope this review is helpful and not offensive to anyone!",1371772800,12,2155,4.459390862944162
5741737,5,B00CU6WBEK,"This review is for now about the anime itself. Those wanting to see a review of the box set itself should come back once it's released and I have a chance to get a hold of it ;)

Those who are coming into this expecting a series about a cute little girl with pink hair that does silly things, are going to find themselves disappointed. A true successor to Death Note, minus the disappointing second act, Future Diary, aka Mirai Nikki, is a darker, more emotional, and more thought provoking story than one would think at first glance.

The anime centers around two characters, Amano Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno, who are caught up in a high stakes game of life or death. Deus ex Machina, the God of the Future Diary universe, is dying, and he's set up a game to determine who will take his place. Each of the 12 contestants is given a 'future diary' that, as the name implies, predicts future events and records them as diary entries, each in a slightly different way. The goal of the game is for each contestant to kill the other 11, and the last man (or woman) standing is the winner.

The great thing about Future Diary is that it gives you a little bit of everything, and holds it together well. The show has a great mix of romance, suspense, comedy, drama, and even horror. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it even has a straight up shonen, super saiyan beat down towards the end.

The characters as well, are one of the places that the series excels at. Even the villains or characters that you hate, will absolutely make you fall in love with them by the end. One in particular comes to mind, one of the first villains you see shows up doing some of the most terrible things in the series, and by the end still manages to come off as not only sympathetic, but one of my personal favorite characters in the series. One of the main characters as well, Yuno, is absolutely exquisitely written. She's adorable, and terrifying, and hilarious, and psychotic all at the same time.

Don't make the mistake of thinking you know what's going to happen either. With a Hunger Games-ish story like this, you can fall into the trap of identifying the main character, and assuming that he's going to win the game and that everybody else is dead. This story has an ending that you will never see coming, although all the clues are there (hint, watch the opening credits closely).

The Japanese voice acting is great, and the animation and soundtrack are both superb. Each perfectly compliments the tone of whatever you're watching, being silly and bubbly one moment, and creepy or suspenseful the next.

If you enjoy series like Gantz and Death Note, then Future Diary is for you, and even if you don't I can't imagine anybody really not liking it. I'll be editing this review once the DVD itself actually comes out to give my thoughts on the box set and the dub.

UPDATE 8/27/2013:

Still waiting for the special edition of the box set to be released, but here are my thoughts on the dub. The editing is very well done, no awkward lip flaps or anything like that (so far). Same with the subtitles, no mistranslations or misleading phrases that I've been able to pick up on.

The voices themselves however, I'm not a huge fan of. Most of the actors are okay, but I have to take issue with the choice of Brina Palencia as Yuno. This isn't to say it's a bad actress, because I very much liked her role as Natsuki in Summer Wars, but she is wrong for this part. Part of Yuno's charm is that she is a complete psychopath, but she sounds and looks like some cute little non-threatening schoolgirl. I'm not saying that the actress has to be as high pitched and cutesy as the original in order to be effective, but miss Palencia really cannot do cute and bubbling very well at all. Yuki and Deus are decent enough, although I still prefer the Japanese versions. Murmuru is barely audible at times. Minene's is great, I instantly fell in love with her English character. In the end I think that this is fairly typical for a dub. Those who prefer subs will hate it and those who prefer dubs will like it.

The good news is that Funimation has given us the uncensored version. A big complaint about what we've seen so far on Hulu and some of the Japanese releases is that the gore and nudity is blanked out, which kind of ruins the immersion factor. Many people have feared that Funimation would be following this trend (ala Deadman Wonderland). However, I'm pleased to report that you will get to enjoy all the blood and gore (not to mention Minene's boobs) in the way that they were originally intended.",1370476800,45,4594,4.463647199046484
5741738,5,B00CU6WBEK,What I liked best about this show (besides the love story between Yuki and Yuno) was the unpredictability of the story. Yuno keeps you guessing and the story ends in such a crazy way. I never saw it coming. Loved it. Now my 2nd favorite anime.,1431561600,,243,4.304347826086956

The opening theme for the first season is great, but the second season, not so much.  But that is a minor nitpick, overall it has a very good soundtrack.

5741751,5,B00CU6WBEK,"I was recommended this series as a way of waiting for the new season Attack On Titan and I figured the product of such an outlandish premise would turn out disastrous and boy was I wrong.

The story is about a young middle schooler named Yuki who is suddenly given a gift of a cell phone that tells him the future in text messages. Soon after, he discovers he is not the only one with this gift and this gift comes with a dangerous game that involves a few other players in a race against time to be the last man standing to become the God of Space and Time. Fortunately for his shy, timid demeanor and cowardice, there's Yuno Gasai; a fellow classmate that's hell-bent on making sure Yuki is the new God, as well as a borderline stalker. Ok I'll be honest, she's a stalker.

I've bought Part One and Part Two and this anime honestly sits really high on my list of favorite anime. The anime was nowhere near predictable nor boring since the anime combines multiple genres such as comedy and drama but primarily graphic, bloody horror. Not for kids in any sense due to strong language and graphic violence as well as nudity and strong thematic/sexually suggestive imagery.

If you're even THINKING about giving it a try, watch the first episode out on YouTube if it's available and see if it's your type of anime. If not, you're gonna miss out.

5741763,5,B00CU6WBEK,"I love this series so much!! Heres my reasons why!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) The story beings with a 14 year old boy named Yukiteru Amano aka Yuki. Yuiki is a loner who writes in his cell phone diary about his day and what goes on around him. His parents are mostly never around so hes alone most of the time. When hes alone at home he goes into his own little world in his head to talk to his imaginary friend Deus (full name Deus Ex Machina). The next day when he wakes up he finds his phone already having been written in it about the future, as he does his normal stuff he finds out that everything written in his diary comes true. When he is leaving school he is followed by a girl named Yuno Gasai  whos phone also tells the future. After an insident with Yuki and Yuno, they both get transported into Deus's world where Yuki finds out that his Imaginary friend isn't really imaginary at all, that is because Deus is really god/the creator/the bender of time, space and reality/the one who can do anything and no one can oppose him. Along with Yuki and Yuno, 10 other people appear in Deus's world and are all told that they are in a last man standing death match where 12 people go in and 1 comes out alive, the winner takes over Deus's spot as god and can do anything their heart desires.

Pros: The story is so amazing!! I was sucked into it at minuet 1 because it keeps you guessing what happens next and never ever ever gets boring. All the characters are very well made up, the voice actors are amazing and they put their souls into making it amazing! The comedy hits at the right moments to really make you LOL.

Pros part 2: What I love about the Limted Edition here is that it comes with a hardcase box to put the dvds in. It comes with 2 valentines day cards to send to your lover.

Cons: The only thing I do NOT like about the limited edition here is that theres only 2 cards that takes up half the box.

Side note: I'm just warning you that this series is quite bloody, people are dieing in many ways and blood gets spilt everywhere, if you are NOT a blood fan than this series may not be for you.

Overall: I LOVE THIS SERIES!! Out of all the anime I watched this year I would give this show Anime of the year award because its so amazing!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!! Get this series and say ""shut up and take my money!""",1405296000,,2359,4.160087719298246
5741764,5,B00CU6WBEK,"On its own and without any context, this anime is enjoyable: It is engaging; the characters are dark, yet likeable; and the entire situation is well-plotted, if a bit depraved and, eventually, a bit complex.

Still, what makes this anime five-star enjoyable for me is its interpretation of a very anime (and difficult to translate) trope: The Yandere. Yuno Gasai -- the true protagonist of this series -- has been dubbed the ""Yandere Queen"" by otaku culture. This is a compliment to the writer of this story and the director of this series: The Yandere is a very limiting character, almost by definition. What I mean by that is that the Yandere is, in fact, a very strictly defined character type: An obsessive character willing to go to any (usually violent, brutal, and sadistic) means for the object of his or her obsession. Consequently, the Yandere, when used, tends to be a supporting character, or a character who suddenly takes on the yandere violence-cum-obsession behavior (think ""Shuffle!"" or ""School Days""). The point is, it is very difficult to create an entire story with the Yandere character being the star.

And sure enough, Future Diary is just such a story. Yuno Gasai is so well-written and so well-acted (both in Japanese and in English), that one can't help being utterly fascinated with this ""Yandere Queen"" all the way to the end of the series. Further, the plot of this anime makes this limiting Yandere character type believable. Granted, if one can suspend disbelief that it is, in fact, ""nurture"" that overwhelmingly shapes behavior, then all of the characters are believable and (to varying degrees) likeable.

Future Diary is a classic to me: It is novel; it is engrossing; it is good storytelling.

One final caveat (and spoiler?), however: If you can find the OVA for this series (""Redial""), do so. It makes the original ending to this anime better, in my opinion.",1403913600,,1896,4.897196261682243
5741765,5,B00CU6WBEK,"This series will blow your mind.  The storyline is continuously great, with no flat spots (where you go... yea, OK... ho-hum).  Each episode advances the story in a meaningful way.  Also, as the story advances the characters are explained, and their motivations make sense.  There is a lot of violence, which is not the kind of thing I normally watch - but the storyline and characters pulled me past that.  I wish there was more of this series (beyond Parts One & Two.)",1402012800,,470,4.614457831325301

5741771,5,B00CU6WBEK,"Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) will give you one of the best anime experiences of your life, but that's only if you know which episodes to watch. I honestly found that the best way to watch it is to skip episodes 3 through 21. Even if you are a die-hard anime fan, before you cast my review aside because of that statement, hear me out.
I discovered Mirai Nikki while watching anime parodies (abridges) on YouTube. After watching an abridged about it, I was only a little interested in the series itself; however, the intro song was pretty awesome. It's called Kuusou Mesorogiwi (Fantasy Mythology) by  Yousei Teikoku. There are a few different english dubs out on YouTube, but my favorite is done by DaelynD  [...]. You'll also find a link to a free download of her rendition in the video's description. Anyway, I figured that with a song that awesome, it couldn't be that bad. I am not really a fan of anime though, so I watched the last several episodes just to see if it had enough action and plot to keep me interested, and I was blown away by what I saw. Mirai Nikki most definitely captured my interest, so I watched through the whole thing on Hulu. However, I found that a majority of the series actually manages to take away from the experience, rather than enhance it.
Now, the reason I'm not a fan of most animes is because of the perverted 'sex-sells' moments, lots of episodes that have nothing to do with the story (filler), little action, bad fight scenes, ridiculous characters and scenarios, and just a lackluster story. If you watch the episodes that I tell you to watch, Mirai Nikki's main plot, main characters, and EVERYTHING is pretty amazing. However, episodes 3 through 21 focus a lot more on the sub plot and side characters. The side characters never seem to even question their actions, which prevents you from caring about them too much. And even worse, in those same episodes, the main characters keep doing things that deviate from their true selves; so, instead of empathizing and caring about the main characters, you'll actually keep yourself distant from them...which, you know, is the complete opposite of what you would want to do. As a whole, the series is still better than most, since there are no real filler episodes, and they manage to keep trickling out plot and some facts throughout. But it does suffer from the other things I hate about most animes, especially when it comes to the appearance of Eight (Ueshita Kamado). Why is her head 10 times bigger than anyone elses? She looks ridiculous, her appearance doesn't fit with the rest, and it really should have been changed.
I do realize that a lot of people like all those things that I hate about animes and you'll want to watch the whole thing. Or maybe you'll watch the episodes I told you to, and be curious about the rest of the show. Well, go ahead and watch it. If you do get discouraged throughout it by how the main characters keep flip-flopping and the side characters don't seem to have much of a conscience, just keep in mind that it gets better...much, much better. At first, you might find the first few episodes to be fine, but by the time you get into the late-teen episodes, I think that you'll agree that the main plot has been watered down quite a bit.
Episodes 1 and 2 inform you of the plot, and pretty much demonstrate how things are going to play out. Now when you skip to episode 22, you might be confused by what's going on, but honestly, a lot of what you're seeing was just introduced in that episode, and goes on to be explained. That's the thing about Mirai Nikki  the last several episodes do a really good job of explaining, making references, and wrapping up plot holes (all in a timely fashion), that you won't need prior knowledge of the whole series. And just so you know, episode 26 is not the final episode. There's a 2-part episode called Redial that was released separate from the rest of the series. Just look it up on YouTube and you can find it. Part 1 isn't very important; it pretty much just does a recap of the ending on episode 26, and then goes on to boring and sexual filler. You can just watch Part 2 and get all the information that you need.

COME BACK TO READ THIS PART AFTER YOU'VE WATCHED THE SHOW! I'M GOING TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW. SPOILER! LAST CHANCE TO STOP READING! SPOILER!

If you're like me, you might have wondered what happened to the third incarnation Yuki. Episode 26 and Redial cover what it's like for all the other characters in the third incarnation world, but I had watched the last several episodes twice, and I don't recall ever seeing or hearing much about the third incarnation Yuki. So I did some looking around and watched some parts again, and I found that I didn't pay close enough attention. In episode 26, when the third incarnation Yuno is sitting with her friends and looks out the window; it shows Yuki with his parents and a girl. In one of the episodes, Yuki had asked this girl out and was refused, but in this world not only did his parents stay together, but the girl accepted Yuki (weird how the girl looks so much like his mother). I guess I kept missing out on this since I was too busy listening to and reading what Yuno was saying. If you caught it, good for you...I somehow missed it twice :/
Lastly  I hate how Masumi Nishijima just blindly loved Minene Uryu right from the start. When they first meet (which it flashbacks to in episode 10), she's a wanted terrorist, but he treats her like a normal girl. She ends up shooting him and escaping. She then goes on to blow up children at the school in an attempt to kill Yuki. They then meet again in a hostage situation at a hospital, but he still treats her just fine. As things progress, it never comes up and he just loves her for being so damn...purple-haired or whatever it is that he likes. This is what I'm talking about when I said that the side characters don't seem to question anything. Right from the start, he loved her, and that was just how it's going to be. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that there was a happy ending where she ended up changing and they had a mutual love and children, but their relationship should have started out with much more hate.

P.S. - As I write this, Attack On Titan has only 1 season out, and it's the best anime I have ever seen. You need to watch it. It's not perfect, but it is the best :)",1392508800,,6411,4.441801189464741

5741773,5,B00CU6WBEK,"I have to start off by saying that this is one of my all-time favorite animes! With that said the part one and part two sets are nicely presented, with each one containing an omake and a select episode commentary.  There were the standard, text less credits, promotional videos and trailers as well. My one complaint with this entire set is that it does not contain the redial ova, leaving you begging for more.  As for the anime itself I absolutely loved it: a mixture of disturbed, tragic, heartwarming and just plain funny moments befalls the entire cast throughout an emotional story that pulls you in and keeps you on your toes. I couldn't help but feel for a character even as I rooted for my favorite to kill them at that same moment. It should go without saying that this may not be a show for all audiences, wearing its TV-MA rating well from time to time. This show contains a fair amount of blood, violence, sex and fan service, though it wasn't to me in any way over the top and fits the shows feel well. A few other good marks I must say are that the animation is great. The soundtrack is filled with emotion and always fits the moment. All of this is paired with spot-on voice acting.

5741777,4,B00CU6WBEK,"Future Diary follows behind a staggering wall of anime that promote the idea of a ""real life game"" where death awaits the loser.  However, it hacks its way to the top of this genre with an axe.  It succeeds on almost every level, even as a Harem (which I am not a particular fan of).  Unoriginal ideas coated and executed with original twists make this an anime not to overlook.  Let's get down to what makes this work.

The animation is top notch.  Battles are fully animated with no short cuts or gimmicks used.  CG is integrated very well and is not jarring.  Animes are played out champions of violence yet the carnage in this show is fresh and personal enough to emerge as unique.  The story line is derived from the same pool of video game obsessed shows like Gantz, Btooom!, Accel World, Sword Art Online, Angel Beats, etc, but the fact that each player has a way to see their future adds a much needed element and boost to separate it from the crowd.

The second piece of originality that propels this show far from boredom is the twist on the Harem genre.  The guy gets the girl right away.  There's no endless breast jiggling resulting in scarlet streamers spraying from the boys' nose.  She's a stalker.  Shes adorable, madly in love with the main character, and completely insane.  There's a hint of Elfen Lied where the girl is cute and friendly one minute and a complete monster the next.  Our main character is also not totally won over by her school-girl-skirt and pink hair.  He clings to her out of necessity and survival for she is willing to kill anything in front of him (friend or foe).

All in all, Future Diary is told intelligently and is reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock story.  The characters are solid and rise above anime stereotypes (not a lot, but enough).  The action is ruthless and mind bending and the best areas of fan service are executed to perfection instead of being out of place and forced in your face.  Im heading on to part 2 with anticipation.  If this show can stay solid and finish itself without a dues ex machina ending makes no sense and removes the creators from complication, than I will return to up the stars to 5.

Theyve created an awesome platform so far and have an opportunity to deliver astonishing revelations about altering the future and exploring the dramatic questions faced when loving insanity.  Whether they reach their full potential or not, this is a solid 4 stars.  Enjoy the wicked ride.",1388361600,2,2461,4.576659038901602

Great yandera romance, some violence, and a pretty original idea that will keep you begging for more.

On a side note - be a little more clearer with your advertising, Amazon. This is ONLY part one in a box that will hold part two. Not a complaint, because I figured this, but it's nice to not have to stop and hover over something to figure out what it truly entails.",1384128000,2,661,4.330645161290323

5741783,3,B00CU6WBEK,"The biggest hook to draw you into watching Future Diary is the insanity of the female lead, Yuno Gasai.  She is what is known as a yandere, a girl who is outwardly sweet and innocent, but in reality something of a murdering psychopath.  In fact, when discussing yandere, she is one of the two characters usually mentioned these days.  She is delightfully, deliciously, totally and completely insane.  She is also completely devoted to the male lead, Yukitero Amano.

The other big strength of the series is plot twists.  There are moments which will just have your jaw dropping as a twist you never saw coming arrives.  It uses almost every trick in the book to make some of the twists surprising, and at times does this very well.  While I saw some coming, enough where a complete surprise that it made it very enjoyable.  It kinda reminded me of riding a roller coaster, but while blindfolded.  Sometimes you know a curve is coming, but alot come out of nowhere.  And the roller coaster analogy really works well for the series, twists and turns and a fast paced ride.

However, it is those same plot twists that start to bring the show down.  Some are just stupid, some are there just because it was time for a new twist, and the one setting up the finale felt like one too many.  In the end, that is more than anything what brings Future Diary(Mirai Nikki us the Japanese name and what many refer to the series as) down from great, to merely decent.  A tightly plotted 13 episode anime would have been so much more effective.  The emotional impact would still be there for the plot twists, the end would have been more impactful.

Another weakness is the complete lack of characters you can really like.  Every one is pretty vile, or becomes so as the madness gets to them.  Another flaw is the pure excess.  Not the gore, which does not bother me, and not really the fan service(though I tend to dislike fan servicy shots of middle school girls), but the constant more and more and more of everything.  It almost literally throws everything including the sink at you.  More is not always better.

Despite that, it is very much a fun, fast paced thrill ride.  It looks great, it works more often than not and I was never bored, never checking to see how long to go.  If not for the final storyline being SO bad, this would be an easy 4 stars and highly recommended.  I still recommend it, but there is alot better out there.",1381968000,3,2428,4.486301369863014
