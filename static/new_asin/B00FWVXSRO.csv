6034996,4,B00FWVXSRO,"The matches on this set are great, no doubt.  Some odd choices, but very good across the board.  My only gripe is why does Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio from Halloween Havoc 1997 have to be on ANOTHER dvd set?  I believe this is at least the 4th dvd set I have that match on, the others being Eddie Guerrero's 3-disc set, possibly both of Rey Mysterio's sets, and the Rise and Fall of WCW set.  The match is incredible but I'd rather not have repeats.  Other than that, I have to take off points for the lack of an insert for content listing.  Very annoying and it seems to be a trend with recent WWE dvd sets.  What's the deal?",1297728000,4,630,4.1570247933884295
6034997,4,B00FWVXSRO,"I won't go into detail about the matches due to other reviews that do that quite well already. I will say that the match selection is generally very good and includes a number of matches which are not only high-flying, but technically sound as well (i.e. Guerrero v. Malenko). As usual WWE does a good job of avoiding matches on other DVD sets and includes a number of forgotten classics from RAW, SMACKDOWN, and Super Stars. The one drawback for me personally was the lack of more WCW matches. WCW's cruiser weight division kept that company going for as long as it did and there were a plethora of matches that could have been put on this DVD and there should have been much more than there was. Other than that, the DVD set was excellent. A definite must for either the casual or die-hard wrestling fan.",1294099200,2,806,4.489795918367347
6034998,4,B00FWVXSRO,"Regardless if you call them light-heavyweights, crusierweights, or ""X"" style wrestlers in TNA...these are wrestlers who have a style that's not ""traditional"" in the sense that they go the extra length by sacrificing their bodies & going the extra length with high risk aerial moves resulting in them getting the nickname of ""high flyers.""  Josh Matthews host this DVD featuring matches from wrestlers who have been labeled as some of the greatest ""high flyers"" in wrestling history.  Along with the matches are different special features with a ""sky-cam"" which is a camera attached to the wrestler's chest as you see their view whenever a wrestler (Evan Bourne, Jamie Noble, John Morrison, Kofi Kingston) executes one of their signature high risk moves.

Ricky Steamboat vs. Brian Pillman - This match happened only a short time after Pillman did his first heel turn & what little people would know but this match would eventually evolve into a feud that would give put the the Hollywood Blondes tag team with Steve Austin on the map. Steamboat started working over Pillman's arm early with armbars & dropping knees. While Brian also performed his ""Air Pillman"" moves such as a countering an irish whip into a headsissors & dropkicking Steamboat in mid-air, he also resorted to dirty tactics by rubbing Steamboat's face in the mat & choking him with the ringropes. Good match that was more of a preview for their later tag team encounters.
WCW Halloween Havoc '92

Evan Bourne vs. Zack Ryder - Bourne worked on Ryder's arm with an armbar & doing his Steamboat inspired armdrag with Ryder tried grounding him by pounding Ryder down & even executing a running leaping legdrop at one point. This was a nice match but not a match I would pick to highlight Evan Bourne (one of his matches against Jericho would have been a better pick).
""Superstars"" June '09

Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Samu - Just a quick note but this is the same Samu who would have more success in WWE around a decade later as a member of the Headshrinkers tag team. Samu attacked Snuka from behind early which only got Snuka fired up & unleashed a heavy attack from him in return. Samu worked over Snuka with grounded nerve holds before Snuka was able to recover for a victory. Just an average match here but again, not one I would pick to showcase Snuka.
""MSG"" Feb. '84

Juventud Guerrera, Hector Garza, Lizmark Jr. vs. La Parka, Psychosis, Villano IV - This match was held under ""lucha libre"" rules meaning that whenever a wrestler leaves the ring, his one of his partners can come in & replace him as if it was a legal tag & it should also be noted that Sonny Onoo had the managerial services of Psychosis & La Parka at this time. This was exactly the quality you got during WCW's hot period of crusierweight action as you had tons of heavy multiman & high flyin action such as a triple suicide dive from the ring to the floor, the ""star"" in the middle of the ring, Psychosis delievering an impactful flip powerbomb on Juvi, and back to back series of top rope moves that didn't connect. Again, action packed match.
WCW Bash At The Beach '97

Shelton Benjamin vs. Shawn Michaels - This was definately a classic match in the history of RAW as two of the most athletic performers went at each other here to the point where J.R. had to say it was one of the best matches on RAW in a while. Shelton took it HBK in the beginning with some amature wrestling & kept getting the upperhand on Shawn including countering HBK's superplex into a crossbody & later countering HBK's superkick into his own side kick. HBK turned it up as the match went on & went toe to toe with Shelton including delivering a Sweet Chin Music that was so impactful...they used it during the opening video of RAW for a long time after this match.
""RAW"" May '05
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary]

J-Crown Cruiserweight Champion Ultimate Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Before I get started, the J-Crown Crusierweight Championship was a championship from Japan that was created after the unification of 8 different crusierweight titles (including the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship that the company didn't acknowledge at that time). Ultimate worked a ground game here that domianted Mysterio for most of the match using various moves like a headlock, dragon suplex, a version of the torture rack backbreaker that current TNA star Abyss refers to as the ""Shock Treatment"", various powerbombs including a combination of a powerbomb into a top rope stun gun, brainbuster, leaping tombstone piledriver, frankensteiner from the top rope, and a big splash from the top rope onto Mysterio on the floor. Rey was able to get some offense in himself like a springboard dropkick from the top rope & later a springboard flip dive to the outside along with a headsissors that drilled Dragon's head into the mat. Eventhough Dragon dominated most of this match, the story behind the match was how Mysterio just wouldn't give up no matter how much punishment he took. This was a great showcase for Ultimate (later referred to as Ultimo) Dragon.
WCW World War 3 Nov. '96

ECW Television Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - This was a match in the series between Malenko & Guerrero in ECW that was dubbed ""The Guerrero/Malenko Classic"" & in this case, this happened in Dean Malenko's hometown of Tampa, FL with Joey Styles pointing out that this was Dean's last title match because if he felt like he couldn't win the title in his hometown then he shouldn't be champion. Eddie attempted to ground Malenko early with a hammerlock before both went into a series of counters resulting in stalemates. Eddie was heavily relied on submission holds like a STF & Gory Special while also using his high flying offense such a a dropkick to the back of the head of Malenko. Dean as usual stuck to his ""shooter"" reputation with various submissions & impactful offense like the tiger bomb along with doing some flying of his own with a crossbody block. They didn't call their series ""a classic"" for no reason as this was a pure quality wrestling match.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" July '95

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Ultimate Dragon - It was noted by the commentators in the early stages of this match that both men knew each other so well from facing each other numerious times not only in WCW but Japan & Mexico as well. That fact was showcased early as both men were exchanging & countering the same holds against each other that either one was able to get the advantage leading to a stalemate & a moment later on when Jericho attempted a cradle only for Dragon to counter it & do the move right back to Jericho. They get more aggressive such as Dragon hitting Jericho with loud stiff kicks & even catching Jericho in midair during the Lionsault with a dropkick while Jericho delievered back to back powerbombs. This was a highly intense & competitive match that showcased what Jericho has said himself numerious times, ""crusierweight action was one of the forgotten reasons WCW was able to dominate during the Monday Night Wars.""
WCW Bash At The Beach '97

1-2-3 Kid vs. Hakushi - For those who don't remember Hakushi, he was in WWE for a short time in 1995 & one of the rare wrestlers at that time who used the japanese style of wrestling combining wrestling with high flying. Both men showcased their ability to fly with Kid at one point doing the corkscrew dive onto the outside while Hakushi executed his signature flip over the top onto the outside while also delievering a top rope clothesline. Eventhough this match was to showcase the 1-2-3 Kid, this was really a showcase for the underrated Hakushi as his performance here gained some cheers from the fans despite being the heel at the time.
SummerSlam '95

John Morrison vs. Tyson Kidd - Morrison started off trying to gain momentum but Kidd kept trying to slow the pace down by going to the ropes. Kidd eventually worked on Morrison's neck with a neckbreaker using the ringropes & a wrenching headlock with the Hart Dynasty getting involved before being sent to the back. Morrison's delievered his own set of offense with a unique variation of the pele kick along with the corkscrew dive over the top rope. This was a great match that built up over time.
""Superstars"" July '09

Ladder Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - Eventhough these three teams are more famous with being the innovators of the T.L.C. match, this was actually the precursor to that match in this being the first triple threat ladder match. This match topped the previous ladder match between the Hardys/Edge & Christian months earlier at No Mercy & was a non-stop highlight reel with tables getting involved along with so many memorable moments like Jeff Hardy's swanton off the biggest ladder in the match & Matt Hardy going through a table that look like it exploded on impact.
WrestleMania 2000
[""Edge: Decade Of Decadance"" & ""Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules""]

Tajiri vs. Super Crazy vs. Little Guido - With this being from the ECW reunion show, we saw Little Guido (mostly known in WWE as Nunzio) come to the ring with various members of his former F.B.I. faction (Tracy Smothers, Big Guido, Tony Mamaluke, J.T. Smith) while Tajiri came to ringside with his former partner Mikey Whipwreck & manager Sinister Minister. The action started off so fast paced that Mick Foley admitted that he would just have to just take a backseat when doing commentary because he knew he couldn't keep up with the action. This was full of various highlights like Crazy's dropkicks to the face on both men, Guido delievering a legdrop off the top rope onto both men, Crazy's own highlight reel of doing a backflip off a balcony onto eveyone in the crowd below, all the partners getting involved along with Whipwreck delievering a stunner from the top rope, and the final showdown between Tajiri & Crazy. No pun intended but total non-stop action.
ECW One Night Stand '05

Brian Pillman vs. Alex Wright - I believe this was Pillman's return match after being out with an injury. This started off with both men showing mutual respect to each other & exchanged a mix of grounded & arial moves with Wright even going for a boston crab submission. Pillman began to get more aggressive as time went on with hard chops to the chest that saw Wright return the favor with forearms & even suplexing Pillman over the top rope to the floor. Pillman at one point tried to dive onto Wright on the outside but ""crash & burned"" on the ringside railing. This was a highly competitive match that got lost amongst everything else going on in WCW at that time but I'm glad WWE found this gem for this set.
WCW Great American Bash '95

Great Muta vs. Sting - Eventhough their more famous series of matches happened in 1989, we got a rare gem here in a match from the WCW/New Japan Supershows both companies would do in the early 1990's. Muta took the fight right to Sting early before Sting used his strength advantage to get it back with moves such as press slamming Muta out of the ring before delievering a flying body press. Back in the ring, Sting grounded Muta before both men went back & forth and missing high risk moves such as the Stinger Splash & Muta's moonsault. In the end, Muta had to resort to his dirty tactics of using the mist but it would be Sting would leave the lasting impression.
WCW New/Japan Supershow '91

WWE Hardcore Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - With both men's history of each other, they were able to each stay one step ahead of each other early before they took the match to the outside & briefly into the crowd. Lynn brought a chair into play on the outside while RVD attempted a rolling thunder in the ring but ended up hitting the chair while Lynn blocked the split legged moonsault with the chair as well. They had very close back to back near falls with RVD hitting an impactful 5 star frog splash with Jerry Lynn on top of the chair. It's no big secret that Lynn's WWE run was very forgettable but this was definately the best match he had in his short career there eventhough they were limited to what they could do because of time & the WWE environment which stops this match from coming close to the quality of their ECW classics.
""Sunday Night Heat"" Aug. '01

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Vader - This was the biggest (literally) challenge Shawn had during his first WWE Championship title reign as Vader was just a monster going through everything in his path leading up to this match. Shawn came out aggressive by taking Vader down with kicks & punches before Vader rebounded by working over Shawn's back with his power & even doing a powerbomb on the floor at one point. This match had various restarts due to Jim Cornette refusing to accept Vader not leaving without the championship before it came back to bite him in the end.
SummerSlam '96
[""Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

ECW Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu - Weapons were used more as objects to set up moves & make them more impactful (as usual with Sabu's offense) while doing both a mix of high flyin' & ground wrestling with some high impact moves like a powerbomb and even the very first move of the match being a stiff kick Scorpio gave Sabu that everyone in the building heard. I can't really describe this match past it being a lost classic in ECW history between two wrestlers who have been heavily underrated for their actual wrestling skills throughout their careers.
ECW CyberSlam '96
[""The Rise & Fall Of ECW""]

Kofi Kingston vs. Christian - This was the finals of the short tournament to crowd a new Intercontinental Champion after Drew McIntyre was stripped of the championship a week earlier. This started off hot with both men exchanging top rope & grounded moves as just kept getting physical as time went on with Kofi even using Christian's own signature kick from the corner before he returned the favor later. This was just a match full of non-stop action from start to finish with the crowd being into it from start to finish.
""SmackDown"" May '10

WWE Light Heavyweight Champion Taka Michinoku vs. Pantera - Various times during the ""Attitude Era"", WWE attempted to compete with WCW's crusierweight division with their own Light Heavyweight division but it just never really came together as it was suppost to but this was a lost gem here with Brian Christopher (Taka's adversary at the time) at ringside doing commentary. Both men delievered what you would expect with high flying action such as both doing dives over the top rope to the floor, Pantera doing a top rope headsissors on Taka who was on the apron to the floor, and a frankensteiner from the top rope. Pantera also worked on Taka's back throughout the match moves such as the various backbreakers including the tilt-a-wirl, camel clutch & surfboard submissions, and even a suicide dive out of the ring onto Taka's back on the floor. This was a good match between both men with the only downfall being the commentary between Christopher & Jerry Lawler (Brian's real life father) at times being a bit over the top & annoying.
""In Your House: No Way Out"" Feb. '98

WWE Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Lita - This was a rare occurance in the divas division where this feud between both women was built up for months on end with Trish constantly hurassing & teasing Lita to the point where she couldn't take it anymore & even broke Trish's nose during their match at Survivor Series causing her to wear a protective mask. It was no big secret that Lita was a little tentative towards using her old luchador style in her matches since her return from the neck injury a little over a year earlier but she was back to her old self here as we saw her do a suicide dive onto Trish on the outside that had her land on her previously injured neck. Trish from there tried to work on her neck with a full nelson & even use her facemask as a weapon as this match just got more intense with close near falls & a very hot crowd before Lita delievered the moonsault to finally gain her revenge against Trish. One of the best ""diva"" matches from WWE.
""RAW"" Dec. '04

Sabu vs. ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam - It was during this time that both Sabu & RVD not only had a on again/off again relationship as tag team partners but also had the same manager in Bill Alfonzo who would always ""call it right down the middle DADDY!"" Before the match, Sabu made the statement that if he didn't win the championship that he would ""walk out."" RVD had control early before Sabu pushed him off the top rope onto the railing before launching off a chair in the ring to do a suicide dive onto RVD in the crowd. RVD returned the favor later by doing a sommersault dive onto Sabu on the outside with Sabu later upping him by doing a top rope splash onto the outside on RVD through a table that was setup on the corner of two guardrails that ended up hurting Sabu's own stomach. Sabu also hurt his knee during the match with him just taping it up so he could continue. Bill Alfonzo came into play by handing both men chairs to do a dueling chairs battle which saw RVD nailed right in the head with Sabu capitalising with back to back triple jump moonsaults followed by a legdrop before he attempted a top rope frankensteiner that RVD blocked to deliever his own split legged moonsault. Alfonzo again got involved in trying to prevent both men from going too far because he ended up getting taken out himself before RVD blocked another triple jump moonsault moonsault with a chair before delievering a five star frog splash to victory. I've said it before that I can never recall a Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu match that wasn't quality & this is no exception.
ECW Guilty As Charged '00

Steel Cage Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Umaga - WWE Champion Randy Orton was at ringside during this match as he was set to face Jeff at the upcoming Royal Rumble PPV. Hardy tried using a hit & move offense against Umaga which worked for a short time until Umaga got his hands on him & used his power advantage like throwing Hardy into the cage multiple times, using nerve holds, and executing the big splash. Orton tried to be help Umaga punish Hardy out by throwing chairs into the cage which eventually backfired as Hardy was able to use it as a weapon himself like a DDT. Hardy tried to escape multiple times only for Orton to cut him off such as slamming the cage door in his face & waiting for Hardy incase he decided to climb down resulting in Hardy being the daredevil that he is & executing the Wisper In The Wind off the top of the cage onto Umaga for a victory.
""RAW"" Jan. '08
[""Twist Of Fate: The Matt & Jeff Hardy Story""]

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Most people concider this the best match in WCW crusierweight history. The storytelling here was right on point with Eddie going after Rey's mask from time to time while showcasing the high flyin' & ground based lucha libre style. Classic match that words wouldn't do justice, no questions asked.
WCW Halloween Havoc '97
[""Rey Mysterio: 619"", ""Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man"", ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story]

Bonus Matches:
Psychosis vs. Ultimate Dragon - Both men grounded each other early with Dragon working over Psychosis' legs while Psychosis was working over Dragon himself with moves like a chinlock submission. At one point, Dragon was whipped into the corner only to do a headstand on the top rope that psyched out Phychosis for a few seconds. Psychosis was the first one to take to the air with moves like a legdrop & elbow drop off the top rope along with a suicide dive over the top to the floor while Dragon later gave a reciept in the form of his asai moonsault from the apron to the floor along with a tornado DDT from the top rope followed by a tiger suplex for a victory.
WCW Uncensored Mar. '97

Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble - This was nothing special past an average match that saw both men work a heavy ground game more than anything.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '08

Hardy Boyz vs. Kai-En-Tai - This was another match that was nothing special past showcasing the Hardy's very early in their careers.
""Sunday Night Heat"" Sept. '98

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman - Eventhough they didn't show it here, it was revealed before this match that Juventud Guerrera joined Eddie Guerrero's ""Latino World Order"" faction which angered Rey Mysterio who was forced into the group against his will (similar to the current John Cena/Nexus storyline). Kidman was out for revenge & to regain the Crusierweight Championship that he lost a week earlier & got real aggressive hitting his impactful moves early like a clothesline, driving Juvi chest first into the turnbuckle, and dropkicking Juventud in midair. Juvi tried working on Kidman's neck with headlocks & even a brainbuster while at one moment jumping from one ring into the other to catch Kidman with a dropkick but mistimed it & ended up kicking Kidman right in the stomach. They went back & forth heavily here before Mysterio made an appearence in the end helping Kidman regain his championship.
WCW World War 3 '98

In the end, the positive here was that we got a bunch of quality matches from WCW with most of them coming from their crusierweight division, a few gems from the ECW library, and some nice rare matches from WWE as well. There were a few repeats but not a heavy overload of them which is acceptable in my book. The only negatives I can say is that I would have really liked some better matches for people like Jimmy Snuka & Evan Bourne while the two bonus matches with Chavo/Noble & the Hardys wouldn't have been missed if they were replaced with something better (maybe a WWE Crusierweight Title match since that title is absent from this collection?). The biggest mistake with this collection is the one name absent from this collection & that's Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger as I know WWE has matches featuring him in their vault...heck, the footage they use showing Ultimo Dragon in the opening credits is from a match in Japan where he wrestled against Liger, I think that's one name you can never leave out when talking about ""wrestling's highest flyers."" Besides those minor issues, this overall is a good collection for those fans of the ""smaller"" wrestlers so this is definately one I would recommend overall.",1288137600,10,22367,4.629536290322581

Along with the matches are different special features with a ""sky-cam"" which is a camera attached to the wrestler's chest as you see their view whenever a wrestler (Evan Bourne, Jamie Noble, John Morrison, Kofi Kingston) executes one of their signature high risk moves.

Ricky Steamboat vs. Brian Pillman - This match happened only a short time after Pillman did his first heel turn & what little people would know but this match would eventually evolve into a feud that would give put the the Hollywood Blondes tag team with Steve Austin on the map. Steamboat started working over Pillman's arm early with armbars & dropping knees. While Brian also performed his ""Air Pillman"" moves such as a countering an irish whip into a headsissors & dropkicking Steamboat in mid-air, he also resorted to dirty tactics by rubbing Steamboat's face in the mat & choking him with the ringropes. Good match that was more of a preview for their later tag team encounters.
WCW Halloween Havoc '92

Evan Bourne vs. Zack Ryder - Bourne worked on Ryder's arm with an armbar & doing his Steamboat inspired armdrag with Ryder tried grounding him by pounding Ryder down & even executing a running leaping legdrop at one point. This was a nice match but not a match I would pick to highlight Evan Bourne (one of his matches against Jericho would have been a better pick).
""Superstars"" June '09

Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Samu - Just a quick note but this is the same Samu who would have more success in WWE around a decade later as a member of the Headshrinkers tag team. Samu attacked Snuka from behind early which only got Snuka fired up & unleashed a heavy attack from him in return. Samu worked over Snuka with grounded nerve holds before Snuka was able to recover for a victory. Just an average match here but again, not one I would pick to showcase Snuka.
""MSG"" Feb. '84

Juventud Guerrera, Hector Garza, Lizmark Jr. vs. La Parka, Psychosis, Villano IV - This match was held under ""lucha libre"" rules meaning that whenever a wrestler leaves the ring, his one of his partners can come in & replace him as if it was a legal tag & it should also be noted that Sonny Onoo had the managerial services of Psychosis & La Parka at this time. This was exactly the quality you got during WCW's hot period of crusierweight action as you had tons of heavy multiman & high flyin action such as a triple suicide dive from the ring to the floor, the ""star"" in the middle of the ring, Psychosis delievering an impactful flip powerbomb on Juvi, and back to back series of top rope moves that didn't connect. Again, action packed match.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Shawn Michaels - This was definately a classic match in the history of RAW as two of the most athletic performers went at each other here to the point where J.R. had to say it was one of the best matches on RAW in a while. Shelton took it HBK in the beginning with some amature wrestling & kept getting the upperhand on Shawn including countering HBK's superplex into a crossbody & later countering HBK's superkick into his own side kick. HBK turned it up as the match went on & went toe to toe with Shelton including delivering a Sweet Chin Music that was so impactful...they used it during the opening video of RAW for a long time after this match.

J-Crown Cruiserweight Champion Ultimate Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Before I get started, the J-Crown Crusierweight Championship was a championship from Japan that was created after the unification of 8 different crusierweight titles (including the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship that the company didn't acknowledge at that time). Ultimate worked a ground game here that domianted Mysterio for most of the match using various moves like a headlock, dragon suplex, a version of the torture rack backbreaker that current TNA star Abyss refers to as the ""Shock Treatment"", various powerbombs including a combination of a powerbomb into a top rope stun gun, brainbuster, leaping tombstone piledriver, frankensteiner from the top rope, and a big splash from the top rope onto Mysterio on the floor. Rey was able to get some offense in himself like a springboard dropkick from the top rope & later a springboard flip dive to the outside along with a headsissors that drilled Dragon's head into the mat. Eventhough Dragon dominated most of this match, the story behind the match was how Mysterio just wouldn't give up no matter how much punishment he took. This was a great showcase for Ultimate (later referred to as Ultimo) Dragon.
WCW World War 3 Nov. '96

ECW Television Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - This was a match in the series between Malenko & Guerrero in ECW that was dubbed ""The Guerrero/Malenko Classic"" & in this case, this happened in Dean Malenko's hometown of Tampa, FL with Joey Styles pointing out that this was Dean's last title match because if he felt like he couldn't win the title in his hometown then he shouldn't be champion. Eddie attempted to ground Malenko early with a hammerlock before both went into a series of counters resulting in stalemates. Eddie was heavily relied on submission holds like a STF & Gory Special while also using his high flying offense such a a dropkick to the back of the head of Malenko. Dean as usual stuck to his ""shooter"" reputation with various submissions & impactful offense like the tiger bomb along with doing some flying of his own with a crossbody block. They didn't call their series ""a classic"" for no reason as this was a pure quality wrestling match.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" July '95

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Ultimate Dragon - It was noted by the commentators in the early stages of this match that both men knew each other so well from facing each other numerious times not only in WCW but Japan & Mexico as well. That fact was showcased early as both men were exchanging & countering the same holds against each other that either one was able to get the advantage leading to a stalemate & a moment later on when Jericho attempted a cradle only for Dragon to counter it & do the move right back to Jericho. They get more aggressive such as Dragon hitting Jericho with loud stiff kicks & even catching Jericho in midair during the Lionsault with a dropkick while Jericho delievered back to back powerbombs. This was a highly intense & competitive match that showcased what Jericho has said himself numerious times, ""crusierweight action was one of the forgotten reasons WCW was able to dominate during the Monday Night Wars.""
WCW Bash At The Beach '97

1-2-3 Kid vs. Hakushi - For those who don't remember Hakushi, he was in WWE for a short time in 1995 & one of the rare wrestlers at that time who used the japanese style of wrestling combining wrestling with high flying. Both men showcased their ability to fly with Kid at one point doing the corkscrew dive onto the outside while Hakushi executed his signature flip over the top onto the outside while also delievering a top rope clothesline. Eventhough this match was to showcase the 1-2-3 Kid, this was really a showcase for the underrated Hakushi as his performance here gained some cheers from the fans despite being the heel at the time.
SummerSlam '95

John Morrison vs. Tyson Kidd - Morrison started off trying to gain momentum but Kidd kept trying to slow the pace down by going to the ropes. Kidd eventually worked on Morrison's neck with a neckbreaker using the ringropes & a wrenching headlock with the Hart Dynasty getting involved before being sent to the back. Morrison's delievered his own set of offense with a unique variation of the pele kick along with the corkscrew dive over the top rope. This was a great match that built up over time.
""Superstars"" July '09

Ladder Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - Eventhough these three teams are more famous with being the innovators of the T.L.C. match, this was actually the precursor to that match in this being the first triple threat ladder match. This match topped the previous ladder match between the Hardys/Edge & Christian months earlier at No Mercy & was a non-stop highlight reel with tables getting involved along with so many memorable moments like Jeff Hardy's swanton off the biggest ladder in the match & Matt Hardy going through a table that look like it exploded on impact.
WrestleMania 2000
[""Edge: Decade Of Decadance"" & ""Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules""]

Tajiri vs. Super Crazy vs. Little Guido - With this being from the ECW reunion show, we saw Little Guido (mostly known in WWE as Nunzio) come to the ring with various members of his former F.B.I. faction (Tracy Smothers, Big Guido, Tony Mamaluke, J.T. Smith) while Tajiri came to ringside with his former partner Mikey Whipwreck & manager Sinister Minister. The action started off so fast paced that Mick Foley admitted that he would just have to just take a backseat when doing commentary because he knew he couldn't keep up with the action. This was full of various highlights like Crazy's dropkicks to the face on both men, Guido delievering a legdrop off the top rope onto both men, Crazy's own highlight reel of doing a backflip off a balcony onto eveyone in the crowd below, all the partners getting involved along with Whipwreck delievering a stunner from the top rope, and the final showdown between Tajiri & Crazy. No pun intended but total non-stop action.
ECW One Night Stand '05

Brian Pillman vs. Alex Wright - I believe this was Pillman's return match after being out with an injury. This started off with both men showing mutual respect to each other & exchanged a mix of grounded & arial moves with Wright even going for a boston crab submission. Pillman began to get more aggressive as time went on with hard chops to the chest that saw Wright return the favor with forearms & even suplexing Pillman over the top rope to the floor. Pillman at one point tried to dive onto Wright on the outside but ""crash & burned"" on the ringside railing. This was a highly competitive match that got lost amongst everything else going on in WCW at that time but I'm glad WWE found this gem for this set.
WCW Great American Bash '95

Great Muta vs. Sting - Eventhough their more famous series of matches happened in 1989, we got a rare gem here in a match from the WCW/New Japan Supershows both companies would do in the early 1990's. Muta took the fight right to Sting early before Sting used his strength advantage to get it back with moves such as press slamming Muta out of the ring before delievering a flying body press. Back in the ring, Sting grounded Muta before both men went back & forth and missing high risk moves such as the Stinger Splash & Muta's moonsault. In the end, Muta had to resort to his dirty tactics of using the mist but it would be Sting would leave the lasting impression.
WCW New/Japan Supershow '91

WWE Hardcore Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - With both men's history of each other, they were able to each stay one step ahead of each other early before they took the match to the outside & briefly into the crowd. Lynn brought a chair into play on the outside while RVD attempted a rolling thunder in the ring but ended up hitting the chair while Lynn blocked the split legged moonsault with the chair as well. They had very close back to back near falls with RVD hitting an impactful 5 star frog splash with Jerry Lynn on top of the chair. It's no big secret that Lynn's WWE run was very forgettable but this was definately the best match he had in his short career there eventhough they were limited to what they could do because of time & the WWE environment which stops this match from coming close to the quality of their ECW classics.
""Sunday Night Heat"" Aug. '01

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Vader - This was the biggest (literally) challenge Shawn had during his first WWE Championship title reign as Vader was just a monster going through everything in his path leading up to this match. Shawn came out aggressive by taking Vader down with kicks & punches before Vader rebounded by working over Shawn's back with his power & even doing a powerbomb on the floor at one point. This match had various restarts due to Jim Cornette refusing to accept Vader not leaving without the championship before it came back to bite him in the end.
SummerSlam '96
[""Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

ECW Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu - Weapons were used more as objects to set up moves & make them more impactful (as usual with Sabu's offense) while doing both a mix of high flyin' & ground wrestling with some high impact moves like a powerbomb and even the very first move of the match being a stiff kick Scorpio gave Sabu that everyone in the building heard. I can't really describe this match past it being a lost classic in ECW history between two wrestlers who have been heavily underrated for their actual wrestling skills throughout their careers.
ECW CyberSlam '96
[""The Rise & Fall Of ECW""]

Kofi Kingston vs. Christian - This was the finals of the short tournament to crowd a new Intercontinental Champion after Drew McIntyre was stripped of the championship a week earlier. This started off hot with both men exchanging top rope & grounded moves as just kept getting physical as time went on with Kofi even using Christian's own signature kick from the corner before he returned the favor later. This was just a match full of non-stop action from start to finish with the crowd being into it from start to finish.
""SmackDown"" May '10

WWE Light Heavyweight Champion Taka Michinoku vs. Pantera - Various times during the ""Attitude Era"", WWE attempted to compete with WCW's crusierweight division with their own Light Heavyweight division but it just never really came together as it was suppost to but this was a lost gem here with Brian Christopher (Taka's adversary at the time) at ringside doing commentary. Both men delievered what you would expect with high flying action such as both doing dives over the top rope to the floor, Pantera doing a top rope headsissors on Taka who was on the apron to the floor, and a frankensteiner from the top rope. Pantera also worked on Taka's back throughout the match moves such as the various backbreakers including the tilt-a-wirl, camel clutch & surfboard submissions, and even a suicide dive out of the ring onto Taka's back on the floor. This was a good match between both men with the only downfall being the commentary between Christopher & Jerry Lawler (Brian's real life father) at times being a bit over the top & annoying.
""In Your House: No Way Out"" Feb. '98

WWE Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Lita - This was a rare occurance in the divas division where this feud between both women was built up for months on end with Trish constantly hurassing & teasing Lita to the point where she couldn't take it anymore & even broke Trish's nose during their match at Survivor Series causing her to wear a protective mask. It was no big secret that Lita was a little tentative towards using her old luchador style in her matches since her return from the neck injury a little over a year earlier but she was back to her old self here as we saw her do a suicide dive onto Trish on the outside that had her land on her previously injured neck. Trish from there tried to work on her neck with a full nelson & even use her facemask as a weapon as this match just got more intense with close near falls & a very hot crowd before Lita delievered the moonsault to finally gain her revenge against Trish. One of the best ""diva"" matches from WWE.
""RAW"" Dec. '04

Sabu vs. ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam - It was during this time that both Sabu & RVD not only had a on again/off again relationship as tag team partners but also had the same manager in Bill Alfonzo who would always ""call it right down the middle DADDY!"" Before the match, Sabu made the statement that if he didn't win the championship that he would ""walk out."" RVD had control early before Sabu pushed him off the top rope onto the railing before launching off a chair in the ring to do a suicide dive onto RVD in the crowd. RVD returned the favor later by doing a sommersault dive onto Sabu on the outside with Sabu later upping him by doing a top rope splash onto the outside on RVD through a table that was setup on the corner of two guardrails that ended up hurting Sabu's own stomach. Sabu also hurt his knee during the match with him just taping it up so he could continue. Bill Alfonzo came into play by handing both men chairs to do a dueling chairs battle which saw RVD nailed right in the head with Sabu capitalising with back to back triple jump moonsaults followed by a legdrop before he attempted a top rope frankensteiner that RVD blocked to deliever his own split legged moonsault. Alfonzo again got involved in trying to prevent both men from going too far because he ended up getting taken out himself before RVD blocked another triple jump moonsault moonsault with a chair before delievering a five star frog splash to victory. I've said it before that I can never recall a Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu match that wasn't quality & this is no exception.
ECW Guilty As Charged '00

Steel Cage Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Umaga - WWE Champion Randy Orton was at ringside during this match as he was set to face Jeff at the upcoming Royal Rumble PPV. Hardy tried using a hit & move offense against Umaga which worked for a short time until Umaga got his hands on him & used his power advantage like throwing Hardy into the cage multiple times, using nerve holds, and executing the big splash. Orton tried to be help Umaga punish Hardy out by throwing chairs into the cage which eventually backfired as Hardy was able to use it as a weapon himself like a DDT. Hardy tried to escape multiple times only for Orton to cut him off such as slamming the cage door in his face & waiting for Hardy incase he decided to climb down resulting in Hardy being the daredevil that he is & executing the Wisper In The Wind off the top of the cage onto Umaga for a victory.

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Most people concider this the best match in WCW crusierweight history. The storytelling here was right on point with Eddie going after Rey's mask from time to time while showcasing the high flyin' & ground based lucha libre style. Classic match that words wouldn't do justice, no questions asked.

Bonus Matches:
Psychosis vs. Ultimate Dragon - Both men grounded each other early with Dragon working over Psychosis' legs while Psychosis was working over Dragon himself with moves like a chinlock submission. At one point, Dragon was whipped into the corner only to do a headstand on the top rope that psyched out Phychosis for a few seconds. Psychosis was the first one to take to the air with moves like a legdrop & elbow drop off the top rope along with a suicide dive over the top to the floor while Dragon later gave a reciept in the form of his asai moonsault from the apron to the floor along with a tornado DDT from the top rope followed by a tiger suplex for a victory.

Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble - This was nothing special past an average match that saw both men work a heavy ground game more than anything.

Hardy Boyz vs. Kai-En-Tai - This was another match that was nothing special past showcasing the Hardy's very early in their careers.
""Sunday Night Heat"" Sept. '98

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman - Eventhough they didn't show it here, it was revealed before this match that Juventud Guerrera joined Eddie Guerrero's ""Latino World Order"" faction which angered Rey Mysterio who was forced into the group against his will (similar to the current John Cena/Nexus storyline). Kidman was out for revenge & to regain the Crusierweight Championship that he lost a week earlier & got real aggressive hitting his impactful moves early like a clothesline, driving Juvi chest first into the turnbuckle, and dropkicking Juventud in midair. Juvi tried working on Kidman's neck with headlocks & even a brainbuster while at one moment jumping from one ring into the other to catch Kidman with a dropkick but mistimed it & ended up kicking Kidman right in the stomach. They went back & forth heavily here before Mysterio made an appearence in the end helping Kidman regain his championship.
WCW World War 3 '98

In the end, the positive here was that we got a bunch of quality matches from WCW with most of them coming from their crusierweight division, a few gems from the ECW library, and some nice rare matches from WWE as well. There were a few repeats but not a heavy overload of them which is acceptable in my book. The only negatives I can say is that I would have really liked some better matches for people like Jimmy Snuka & Evan Bourne while the two bonus matches with Chavo/Noble & the Hardys wouldn't have been missed if they were replaced with something better (maybe a WWE Crusierweight Title match since that title is absent from this collection?). The biggest mistake with this collection is the one name absent from this collection & that's Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger as I know WWE has matches featuring him in their vault...heck, the footage they use showing Ultimo Dragon in the opening credits is from a match in Japan where he wrestled against Liger, I think that's one name you can never leave out when talking about ""wrestling's highest flyers."" Besides those minor issues, this overall is a good collection for those fans of the ""smaller"" wrestlers so this is definately one I would recommend overall.",1403568000,2,22365,4.629536290322581

Any way you slice it the wrestlers featured in this 3-disc collection are truly the highest flyers in pro wrestling. Hosted by Josh Matthews, we have some short video packages on each superstar then a match that showcases them, along with demonstrations of some key moves off the top rope by a few superstars.

Disc 1

-10/25/92, WCW Halloween Havoc, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat vs. Brian Pillman: Lost classic here as Steamboat works on Brian's arm with his trademark arm drags, arm ringers and chops to the shoulder. Pillman displayed some dirty tactics too, grinding Ricky's face into the canvas and choking him against the ring rope. The action stays at a good pace and the momentum shifts enough for the flow of the match to stay about even. Ricky reverses a roll-up and pins Pillman to win this good, solid match. 8/10.

-6/11/09, WWE Superstars, Evan Bourne vs. Zack Ryder: I've been a fan of Bourne's since I saw him as Matt Sydal on TNA's Victory Road '04 PPV and this match is good and does showcase some of Evan's best moves, including Ricky Steamboat like arm drags but there's more mat wrestling from these two. Ryder works on Evan's ribs with suplexes, bearhugs and leg locks and a nice dragon sleeper, Bourne comes back with his unique set of kicks then eventually hits Air Bourne and makes the cover to win. 7/10.

-2/20/84, MSG, ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka vs. Samu: Its a short one here, Jimmy hits some chops and fists to the head and a nice crossbody for 2. Samu comes back slamming Snuka into the corner then works on Jimmy's throat and his trap with a nerve hold. Snuka comes back hitting big moves including a flying headbutt then hits a crossbody from the top and makes the cover to win. 6/10.

-7/13/97, WCW Bash At The Beach, Juventud Guerrera, Hector Garza & Lizmark Jr. vs. La Parka, Psychosis & Villano IV: Loved this one here as I've always been a fan of La Parka, just thought he had a cool look and style. There's a little bit of mat wrestling to start out but the wrestlers quickly start taking to the air in some dazzling fashion, including triple dives by Garza's team and a series where all the men hit moves to the outside, the best being Juvi hitting a huge dive. There's just too many cool spots to list any more, Villano V comes down, behind the refs back but Garza hits a standing moonsault on V and covers him to win. 9/10.

-5/2/05, Raw, Gold Rush Tournament Match, Shelton Benjamin vs. Shawn Michaels: In all the 20+ years I've watched wrestling I've never seen a more naturally gifted wrestler than Shelton Benjamin and you see why in this match. Great, great match here, both show some good mat based wrestling, Shelton seemed to have Michaels' number throughout this whole match and almost had him beat on a few occasions. This match was crisp, both were on their game and Shelton only made one mistake as he jumped from the top rope but got hit with one of the biggest Sweet Chin Music's in history as Shawn covers to win. 10/10.

-11/24/96, WCW World War 3, J-Crown Cruiserweight Championship Match, Ultimo Dragon (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio Jr.: Always been a fan of Ultimo's work and style and this is quite a good match between two great high flyers. The 8 belts Dragon came to the ring with were from him winning a match that gave him those titles from 3 different countries and Rey had a chance to win them all. Both their styles mixed well, Rey hit his usual hgh impact, quick moves while Dragon used some straight wrestling, stiff kicks and good high flying moves of his own. This is another one thats better to be watched and enjoyed, Dragon wins after hitting a snap powerbomb for 3 to retain his titles. 9/10.

-7/21/95, ECW Hardcore TV, ECW World Television Championship Match, Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko: Its a classic as most of their matches were usually, plenty of good mat wrestling, back and forth exchanges of submission holds and high flying moves. The momentum changes quite often and the pace rarely if ever slows down for the 15 minutes of this match. Dean reverses a roll-up and pins Eddie for the 3 to win the TV title in his hometown of Tampa, Florida. 9/10.

Special Features on Disc 1:

-3/16/97, WCW Uncensored, Ultimo Dragon vs. Psychosis: Good one here as both trade arm drags and mat wrestle for the first few minutes, nice headstand in the corner by Dragon then both trade the camel clutch submission move. Psychosis hits a nice dive to the outside onto Ultimo, then a slingshot leg drop to the outside, Dragon comes back with the Asai moonsault off the second rope. More high flying action as both hit high risk moves but can't keep the other down, Ultimo hits a Tiger suplex and makes the cover to win. 8/10.

-4/18/08, Smackdown, Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble: Both these guys are good workers and can put on a good match, but this isn't one of them. There is some good submission wrestling and exchanges from both men, but that spark just isn't there so its kinda blah. Chavo wears down Noble, who makes a come back with a nice Northern Lights Suplex, Chavo hits a hotshot on Jamie then hits the frogsplash for the win. 5/10.

-Flight Turbulence: A video package of high flying moves that didn't end well, like Brock's Shooting Star Press at Wrestlemania, Kurt Angle's moonsault off the top of a cage, Shane's 50 foot fall at Summerslam and others.

Disc 2

-7/13/97, WCW Bash At The Beach, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Ultimo Dragon: Its such a fun match to watch as both know each other so well from wrestling in Mexico and Japan, they worked quite well together, whether it was on the mat or in the air. Early on they trade arm drags, flips and even back kicks and the pace keeps the crowd energized, then Dragon hits some stiff kicks and locks on a nerve hold, but Jericho comes back hitting a double snap powerbomb. There's plenty more action as both can't keep the advantage for long, Jericho ends up hitting a victory roll for the win to retain his title. 9/10.

-8/27/95, Summerslam, 1-2-3 Kid vs. Hakushi: This was a very enjoyable one as Kid hit some great kicks and high flying moves while Hakushi got in some good moves of his own which got quite a reaction from the crowd. There's good wrestling by both, along with some stiff kicks by both men especially Hakushi, who hit a handspring into a flip over the top onto the Kid. After a splash from the top rope only gets two, the Kid attempts a spin kick, but gets caught and slammed into the mat and Hakushi pins him for 3. 7/10.

-7/30/09, Superstars, John Morrison vs. Tyson Kidd: Pretty good wrestling here by both guys, John hits some good arm drags, while Tyson relied on dirty tactics and using a sleeper hold to wear him down. Morrison comes back hitting his unique array of kicks and a clothesline over the top rope, then a twisting splash to the outside. John ends up hitting Starship Pain and covers to win. 6/10.

-4/2/00, Wrestlemania 2000, Triangle Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian: The prelude to the TLC series of matches and quite a good one as all three teams get some good spots in. Christian hits a dive to the outside onto Matt and Bubba Ray, later Bubba hits a cutter on Christian off the ladder, the best spot was when Jeff Hardy hits a big swanton onto Bubba off of a ladder through a table. Matt is up trying to get the belts when Edge knocks him off and he falls through a table in the ring, Edge & Christian grab the titles to become the new champions. Great match, 9/10.

-6/12/05, ECW One Night Stand, 3-Way Dance, Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Tajiri: Good three-way that has lots of high flying, some double teaming early on and a huge moonsault by Crazy from the balcony to the floor onto both guys. Guido gets misted by Tajiri then a Whipper Snapper from Mikey Whipwreck and Guido is gone. Crazy and Tajiri trade moves, including a swinging DDT from Tajiri, but he misses the Buzzsaw Kick and Crazy hits a moonsault and makes the cover for 3. 7/10.

-6/18/95, WCW Great American Bash, Brian Pillman vs. Alex Wright: Really good one here despite a couple of botched moves by Wright (who was 20 at this time and a rookie, mind you). Pillman did show some early signs of his famous Loose Cannon character as he tried to be nice early one but after the botched moves he got more angry and aggressive, which brought a big reaction from the crowd. There's plenty of good wrestling and high flying here and neither can keep the other down for 3, until Wright reverses a sunset flip and pins the veteran Pillman for 3 much to the crowds dismay. 8/10.

-3/21/91, WCW/Japan Supershow, Great Muta vs. Sting: Very rare and good one here featuring two of my favorites and its a classic. The Japanese setting added a cool feel as the fans really wanted the action to stay in the ring and booed any dirty tactics mainly by Muta. The action starts off fast as Muta hits the handspring elbow and hits a dive to the outside, Sting takes over using his power and press slams Muta to the floor, then dives over the rope onto Muta. The pace stays very quick, with some wrestling mixed in, each counters the others trademark moves, then Muta sprays Sting with the green mist and hits a crossbody from the top and covers for 3. 9/10. Afterwards Sting is furious, attacks Muta and locks on the Scorpion Death Lock.

-8/5/01, Sunday Night Heat, WWE Hardcore Championship Match, Rob Van Dam (Champion) vs. Jerry Lynn: Forgot all about Lynn being part of the WWE, but that being said this was a good match albeit short. Given how they both knew each other from the storied rivalry in ECW, they were able to counter each others moves and each guy hit some good high spots. There's not much weapon use, just a chair but they make it count and RVD hits the frog splash on Lynn who was laying on the chair and covers for 3. 6/10.

Special Feature on Disc 2

-9/27/98, Sunday Night Heat, The Hardy Boyz vs. Kai En Tai: Its a quick one here where Kai En Tai wear down the younger Hardy's, Matt hits a dive over the top and Jeff crashes and burns on the outside when he misses a splash over the top. After Funaki gets hit with a flag, the Hardy's hit a tandem splash and leg drop move from the top rope and cover to win. 4/10.

Disc 3

-8/18/96, Summerslam, WWE Title Match: Vader vs. Shawn Michaels (Champion): This was probably Vader's best match in WWE as he almost had Shawn beat on a few occasions, Vader hits all kinds of fists, clotheslines, even a powerbomb on the outside. Shawn out quicks Vader, hitting a nice dive over the ropes to the outside. Shawn wins the match via count out, Jim Cornette demands the match be restarted and it is, Michaels uses Cornette's racket for a DQ finish, Cornette  again demands the match restart and it does, Vader even kicks out of Sweet Chin Music, the referree gets knocked out, here comes a Vader bomb that Michaels kicks out of. Vader goes for the moonsault but misses, Shawn hits a moonsault of his own and pins Vader to retain his title. 9/10.

-2/17/96, ECW Cyberslam, ECW World Television Championship Match, 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu: Good one here with the underrated Scorpio taking on ECW's daredevil Sabu, its a great mix of high flying, wrestling and hardcore action. It goes on for quite a while, 30 minutes in fact and rarely slows down, Sabu hits a dive over the top rope into the crowd on Scorpio but only a 2 count, 2 Cold comes back with a huge powerbomb then a top rope leg drop. The 30 minute time limit expires and 2 Cold Scorpio retains his title. 8/10.

-5/14/10, Smackdown, Intercontinental Championship Tournament Finals, Kofi Kingston vs. Christian: Pretty good one here that mixed wrestling early on but picked up once it was taken to the air. Kofi misses a dive on the outside, Christian counters with a dive of his own nailing Kofi. After Christian tries wearing down Kingston, Kofi comes back with a big crossbody then hits the Boom Drop but only a 2 count. More near falls occur then Kofi rolls out of a sunset flip attempt and hits Trouble In Paradise and covers to win the I.C. title. 8/10.

-2/15/98, In Your House: No Way Out, WWE Light Heavyweight Championship Match, Taka Michinoku (Champion) vs. Pantera: This was an enjoyable one, Taka hit some high moves and Pantera also had a good showing, like when he hit a dive over the top rope onto Taka. There's some good quick exchanges, then Taka hits a very impressive springboard dive to the outside. Later Taka hits the Michinoku Driver and covers to retain his title. 8/10. Side Note: The commentary from Jerry Lawler and Brian Christopher was fairly annoying as they ripped apart both guys mainly Taka.

-12/6/04, Raw, WWE Women's Championship Match, Trish Stratus (Champion) vs. Lita: After coming back from her neck injury and dealing with the loss of her child (a horrifying storyline to say the least), we have this great main event of Raw. These two always had good matches and the back and forth hard hitting action in this contest was just magic, Lita dived to the outside and looked like she snapped her neck. Trish used her protective mask to gain an advantage and just beat Lita down and targeted her neck. Lita counters the Stratusfaction, hits the Twist of Fate then hits the moonsault and covers to win the title. 8/10.

-1/9/00, ECW Guilty As Charged, ECW World Television Championship Match, Rob Van Dam (Champion) vs. Sabu: Given how they were both trained by Sabu's uncle the Original Sheik, these two always did well when they faced off. The action had the expected high spots and hardcore action, Sabu hit his trademark dive from the top into the crowd onto RVD, who comes back with his own dive over the top to the floor. Great spot where Sabu dives off the top and drives RVD through a table on the outside, later RVD hits the frog splash and covers Sabu to retain his title. 8/10.

-1/7/08, Raw, Steel Cage Match, Jeff Hardy vs. Umaga: WWE Champion Randy Orton wanted Hardy softened up before their match at the Royal Rumble so enter the Samoan Bulldozer Umaga. This isn't a bad cage match, Umaga dominates with his strength, Jeff came back with his unique offense but got yanked off the ropes when he tried to escape. Later Jeff attempts to escape again, gets to the top but Randy is waiting on the floor with a chair, so Jeff hits a massive Whisper in the Wind off the cage to Umaga and covers him to win. 7/10.

-10/26/97, WCW Halloween Havoc, Mask vs. Title Match: Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Eddie Guerrero (Champion): What a fast paced, great match. The timing of these two couldn't have been better. Rey pulls off a sick flip off of the top rope into a DDT on Eddie, great move. Eddie also works over Rey's back with some great wrestling moves and I can't really say much more about it, just watch and enjoy. Rey wins in about 14 mins. to become the Crusierweight title. 11/10.

Special Feature on Disc 3

-11/22/98, WCW World War 3, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman: This had the 3 ring set up for the main event battle royal. Good match here as both display some great wrestling and the usual high flying moves, Juvi lets his cockiness get in the way of beating Kidman on a couple of occasions. Billy seemed more aggressive than normal hitting a stiff clothesline, hitting a dropkick as Juvi was jumping from the top rope, then stomping him into the mat. Juvi hits a great series of moves including a dive to the floor, then a springboard dropkick from one ring to the other but only for two. Later Juvi hits the Juvi-Driver but can't follow up. While both are on the ropes, Rey Mysterio comes down holds Kidman's tights, Juvi falls to the ring and Billy ends up hitting the Shooting Star Press to win the title. 8/10.

This was an enjoyable collection, not too many repeats though the Halloween Havoc '97 match could've been replaced. Its an amazing match but its been on enough DVD sets all ready, I also would've replaced the Chavo/Noble & Hardy Boyz/Kai En Tai with something better as both were just average. But its more than worth having in your DVD library especially if you like cruiserweight action.",1318204800,3,16293,4.5186693822131705
