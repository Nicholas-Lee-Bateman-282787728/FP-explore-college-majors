8003331,5,B0000UX52A,"This is one of Bill Zebub's older films, made in I think 2002. For those who do not know, Bill Zebub is an independent Writer/Director who makes horrors and comedies that generally like to push the limits of political correctness.

Metalheads isn't quite as outrageous as some of Bill's more recent work, but it is still filled with good humor and good plotlines. The basic premise for this movie is explained in the title. It is supposed to depict a group of metalheads. For anybody who consider's themself a metalhead or hangs around with metalhead-type people, this film is filled with great subtlties. This movie is filled with the cliched characters from the metal world. People who are broke. People who live in their mom's house. People who are the 2 previously said, yet still have an elitist attitude.

The movie stars Bill Zebub himself. He is the main character with a girlfriend, Jean, who is getting fed up of his lack of money and piggishness. More twists in the plot emerge as Jean grows a fancy for Bill's friend. This is only the main plotline, because Bill Zebub is a great writer who is excellenmt at intertwining multiple plotlines.

The movie has some great humor, and the soundtrack is filled with  some really good yet unknown metal artists. This is a good film to watch with some friends or even to watch alone. If you are a fan of comedy films that aren;t afraid to come over to the dark side, than this film is for you. Also check out Dirtbags.",1148688000,2,1470,4.599236641221374

My bad movie detector(henceforth known as BMD)went off immediately when the opening credits started off with a digital skeleton jogging through a graveyard for what seemed like 20 minutes. We are then thrown headlong into some nonsensical story about some lottery ticket and metal-head hijinx.  To get a good feel for this movie, think ""Jackass"" but low brow.  The acting, editing, and dialogue were equally horrible setting my BMD off the charts.  The only time I laughed while watching this is to laugh at the sheer ineptitude of it all...I loved this film!
Save your money, buy ""Gigli"" instead.",1074643200,3,775,4.81203007518797
