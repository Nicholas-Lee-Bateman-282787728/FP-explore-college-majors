3152472,4,B00166FBSS,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The first half of the film and the last 15 minutes were absolutely excellent. In between those two times, the movie got lost in itself and its attempt to make an action sequence.

The movie is about Angela and her life after...well...dying. Angela is killed at the hands of her abusive boyfriend and must deal with the fact that she is ""mortally challenged"" (aka a zombie). She attends support groups (kinda AA but ZA) to try to comprehend her new life and deal with the new discriminations she is facing.

Reminiscent of an era where lynching was the norm, this movie manages to confront social issues and intolerance perfectly. Bypassers seem to ignore what is happening and continue with their daily lives. Angela also has to deal with the temptation for human flesh, her stalker ex-boyfriend and intolerance groups (very KKK) that have banded together to torture and kill zombies. Now, the zombies in this movie are still conscious, have feelings, thoughts, etc and work just about the same as any other living person, except for the fact that they are supposed to be dead. So, it is pretty hard to watch what the living ""humans"" do to the zombies. Indeed, the film beautifully juxtaposes the dead with the living and then back again. There is no black and white, no good and evil, in the end, this morality play is refreshing and interesting. Having watched this type of treatment during the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", the action took on a new dimension because you could see that these functioning human zombies had feelings and were in pain. This movie proves to be both intelligent and thoughtfully critical of society.

The cinematography is pretty good for a B movie and the storyline is excellent. The only problem with this movie lies in the part where it attempts to make an action sequence near the end. Said action sequence fails miserably.

The DVD includes several deleted scenes.",1210723200,12,1949,4.808955223880597

3152474,3,B00166FBSS,"After seeing Insane-O-Rama's earlier vampire movie, Strange Things Happen At Sundown, I had high hopes for this entry in the world of Zombie flicks.

In Strange Things, Marc Fratto and crew gave a new take on what life would be like if you were a vampire in 21st century America.  You would still need rent money, gas money, a car, and rather than buying food at a grocery store, you have to hide your socipathic, homicidal tendencies for your craving for human blood.  In short, it's not easy being dead.

And there's a tendency that this sort of life would drive you insane.  Not exactly a romantic notion of vampires, is it?

In addition Fratto, on a B-movie budget, was able to produce a well written, original movie, and get surprisingly good performances out of amateur and semi-professional actors in Strange Things.  So, I was understandably excited about Zombies Anonymous coming out.

Past Zombie movies from the likes of George Romero were little more than monster movies, and had become very formulaic.  Zombies Anonymous is an original take on the Zombie genre, telling the story from the Zombie's point of view.  If you are a fan of the genre, stop reading now and get this movie!

Like in Strange Things, being dead doesn't mean you don't need rent money.  So, the heroine in this story still goes to work and tries to live her life as normally as a murdered person can.  But blending in with the living isn't easy, as the living have a natural aversion to the dead; so there are interesting themes on discrimination and living a double life.  Zombies Anonymous follows our heroine's attempts to get along in a world that treats her as a second-class citizen, and her inner struggle to accept what she has become.

There are so many subtleties and possibilities with the concept of the movie that one can't help but be disappointed when those possibilities aren't fully realized.  Maybe it's a victim of its own high aspirations, or a victim of its budget, but while Zombies Anonymous entertains, it falls short on many levels.

And that's a shame.  Fratto had a great vision, but somehow he just didn't get it to gel on this one.  In summary, it's worth watching, but it's not as great as it should be.",1249430400,2,2218,4.670103092783505
3152475,3,B00166FBSS,"I can only give the movie 3 stars due to the Commandant & the X-Boyfriend.  The ""C"" by any other name would still be a ""C"".  Very stereotypical of a lesbian hate-monger, trying to prove that her balls are bigger than everyone else's.  I've seen too many of the X in real life.  Idiots like that need to die.
Onto the movie...
Outside of the above mentioned, I enjoyed it.  The support group was great.  Every emotion was brought out in there.  The donuts & coffee were an unexpected treat.  I don't understand why every movie that has racism (dead-ism?), hatred & bigotry needs an American flag in those scenes.  Because I have one on the front of my house make me a racist?
If you're looking for nudity, you'll have to go to the deleted scenes for that.  Otherwise, good movie that had the potential to be great.",1240790400,,813,4.395973154362416
3152476,3,B00166FBSS,"Like the terrific Canadian zombie film FIDO, Marc Fratto's film ZOMBIES ANONYMOUS tries to offer us a refreshing new twist on the tired old zombie story. In Fratto's world the zombies are only the recently dead, they possess all their mental faculties although both their minds and bodies do deteriorate with time, and most importantly they are NOT flesh eating monsters intent on gobbling your grey matter. All these poor souls want is to continue ""living their lives"" as they had been before they had been so rudely interrupted by undeath; go to work, pay the mortgage, walk the dog, etc. Society however, has major problems accepting them. Most folks just pretend not to see tham at all, while others engage in more overt acts of discrimination such as firing them from their jobs simply because they are ""mortally challenged"", and still others react as do ZA's chief antagonists by forming hate groups resembling the KKK and the American Nazi Party. As you can see ZA is VERY similar to FIDO in the respect that both deal with the concept of zombies representing a lower caste of humanity that was used as slave labor and/or forbidden entry vis a vis a huge fence in the case of FIDO and in the case of ZOMBIES ANONYMOUS we've got young punks banding together under the leadership of woman known as The Commandant for the sole purpose of making the undead a little less ""un"".

Sounds like a great premise doesn't it? Well, it is. And the fact that it was supposed to be a black comedy made it all the more enticing to me, but the sad truth is that these film makers simply bit off more than they could chew, pun intended. Not only do they take on the issue of racial and/or ethnic prejudice they also tackle domestice violence in one of the stongest opening scenes I've ever seen in a zombie flick (especially one that promised it was going to be a comedy), a scene that is echoed in the finale. Normally I'd say Bravo, nice take on a difficult subject! But now we have two major story lines going, prejudice AND domestic violence and its going to take one heck of a film maker to pull all this off. Especially since Fratto decides to link the domestic violence to an thread of female impowerment.(Trust me, here its a bit odd) Three out four of the most important characters in the film are women; there's our protagonist Angela (Gina Ramsden) who is murdered by her rat of a husband Josh (Joshua Nelson) in that first scene I mentioned, then there's the evil Commandant Christa McNamee who's one nasty piece of work, and of course the big zombie leader known as Mother Solstice, plus this other zombie chick who's hanging with Josh for some reason we're not privy to. I hate to criticize a film maker for attempting too much but that's exactly what happened here. They started with a comedy that really isn't very funny, added several messages, and for good measure they tacked on an orgy of zombie mayhem with everyone trying to kill everyone else. There were a lot of ideas for some great flix in this movie, but sadly there were just too many ideas for one movie.",1235347200,3,3072,4.565217391304348
3152477,4,B00166FBSS,"Feeling a little cold?  Slow?  Lifeless?
There is hope for the walking dead.
Zombies Anonymous.

This low budget chomp-a-thon is totally genius.  I had super-low expectations, but this is just great stuff for the zombie fan.

The setup reminds me of the TV series TRUE BLOOD.  Instead of vampires, it's zombies trying to coexist in the land of the living.  This reaffirms just how much most real people suck.

It starts off with a pretty intense domestic disturbance.  A controlling psycho boyfriend shoots his woman in the head when she tries to breakup with him.  But, she doesn't completely die.

She becomes a confused member of the undead.  I know, this makes no sense in the realm of Zombiedom, but get over it.  Allow the rules to be bent a little, K?

This gal goes to a zombie support group to talk with some other flesh eaters.  Too freakin' funny!  They try to eat doughnuts(because thats what people do at these meetings) but quickly barf 'em back up.  Oh well, they're not good for anybody anyway.

There are some other ways these dead folk try to fit in and avoid being crucified by the living.  There is a popular skin cream called ""Look Alive!"" that helps cover up hanging flesh wounds and hideous scars.
Each one of the zombs do their best to look ""normal"" and integrate themselves back into society.

But unfortunately, this is no easy task.  Jobs are hard to come by.  Imagine getting served at the local diner by a waiter that shambles and coughs up blood into your food.  Not too appetizing.

Plus, there are plenty of angry people that make it impossible for the dead to make a living.  How would you like to be the employee that gets replaced by a corpse that will work for half the wages?  Tempers flare, and a spectacularly gory war ensues.

Besides the great twist on the genre, Zombies Anonymous has nice doses of humor mixed in but not overdone.  Plus it has the mandatory sick gory human devourage.  No CGI, just plenty of real looking blood and guts.  Excellent.

But there are some slight issues too though.  It is very low budget, the camera work is below average and the acting is perfunctory, at best.  Nudity really has no place in making a nice cohesive zombie story, but for some reason I'm always disappointed when it's not squeezed in.  These zombies sometimes shamble, other times they walk normally or even run.  Plus, they talk, think, and can function adequately?  Yeah, it's a stretch.  Finally, the reason people become zombies after a car wreck or whatever fatal incident is never explained.  That might turn off some viewers.

Still, I'll take this over DIARY OF THE DEAD anyday.  A surprisingly solid film to bite into.",1233964800,,2667,4.639484978540772

Even going so far as to have the people speaking out against the zombies quote the Hitler.  Most of the things they tried to make humorous failed to be funny. I would suggest saving your money if you are looking for a fun b movie. If you are looking for a zombie social commentary, than this is for you.",1228435200,3,593,4.247787610619469

Interesting...

1) ACTING: The acting here is very well done. Aside from the actors portraying The Commandant and Solstice, everyone was excellent. The two mentioned really made it difficult for me to stay in the scene, as they really caught my focus of attention when onscreen. I don't know if they needed more rehearsals or what, but the last thing a director wants is something that distracts the viewer.

2) PRODUCTION: Again, a job well done. I had no lighting or continuity issues, and the only real sound issue was that the occasional background music was overpowering and louder than the actors. Everything is kept very tight. The blood and gore was plentiful and well handled. The character development is nicely done. The ""big finale,"" to me, was kind of a let down, as I thought it didn't really fit into the tone of the movie.

3) ZOMBIES: Here is the big difference. The zombies in this movie are the risen dead, but continue to go on about their daily lives. Whatever caused then to die, (murder, illness, etc.) they then have a ""re-birth."" But only the recent dead return. Those already dead and buried stay that way. Reminiscent of the movie 'Fido,' but with the zombies having complete control of their mental capacities.

4) THE CAUSE: Unknown.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: Overall, I found this to be a very interesting, thought provoking movie. Sadly, it deals with a serious subject that we are all too familiar with; our own intolerance of others. Whether it be gender, race, sexual preference, or now, undead, this movie's message hits the nail right on the head. I think Romero would be proud of this ""message movie.""

8261078,4,B00166FBSS,"ZA: Zombies Anonymous (2006)

 Released in theaters, very briefly, as Last Rites of the Dead, ZA represents the kind of high concept Zombie flick that we want to see.  This one has flickers of social commentary hidden amongst the guts and gore.  Now in his mid 40s Director, writer and producer Marc Fratto also made Strange Things Happen at Sundown and the 2012 film Hell Fire.  The talented Mr. Fratto also composed the score for all three films as well as the 2004 Satan's Schoolgirls.  For ZA he also did voice acting, film editing and recorded the music as well as composed the music.  We can fairly call this film his work.
 Star Gina Ramsden also worked with Fratto on the video Strange Things Happen at Sundown.  Even though her last movie was ZA and she hasn't worked since she certainly has enough acting competence to have further roles as an actress.  Most of the other actors on the other hand might have been offered roles in their off time as ice cream dippers at Cold Stone.  The level of acting reaches only the lowest end of what we can accept in a Zombie flick.
 But the idea is super.  In a post Zombie world, the Zombies are neither particularly numerous nor dangerous.  They exist along side the rest of us.  Many of them are fully functioning and hold jobs and so on.  We would only notice that they are dead because of the inevitable deterioration of the flesh, oozing blood and gaping wounds.  In the evolving society several differing and contending social groups co-exist, to an extent.  The ZA group are earnest strivers.  They want to hang on to as much of life as they possibly can.  They hold down jobs and try to get along.  They go to Zombies Anonymous meetings to give one another support in their hopeless struggle.  An innovation is a range of cosmetic products that are designed to help Zombies cover the rotten spots on their skin and so help them to continue in the world of the living.
 A sociopathic gang of humans preys upon the Zombie community.  They are after all dead, so beating them into a new death or beheading them or any other horrible thing the brutes inflict upon the Zombies counts for nothing in the eyes of the greater society.  The dead are after all, dead.
 A third group are the loud and proud Zombies.  They gladly kidnap regular folk from the streets and gobble up.  In an odd take on things, they inject pureed human flesh directly into their own brains in some kind of direct to the nervous system ecstasy.
 When Anglia-Gina Ramsden- is murdered by her boyfriend, she turns to ZA for help.  An oddly human relationship exists between Anglia and her killer boyfriend Josh (played by Joshua Nelson who is a real actor and a good one, at least good enough for this).  They are passionate about one another, that's for sure.  In one scene she cuts off one of Josh's testicles and then stabs him in the head with the same knife-with the testicle still on the blade.  I found that image disturbing.
 All this makes for an interesting film, an excursion into an un-looked at version of Zombie life.  Be warned however.  The last 40 minutes of the film are extremely bloody and graphic.  It seems that the only way to really, finally kill a Zombie is to decapitate him.  The culmination of the film is a three way battle to beyond the death by the gang of Zombie haters, the ZA victims and the Zombie activists that goes on and on and on.  No matter how many times a character is shot or stabbed or other wise harmed, he keeps on keeping on.  Until the head is severed or blown off.
 Although I found the blood and so on to be very disturbing, rather than silly or stupid as in other films, I still give ZA three brains.  It should be rated with an R for lots of violence, gore, bad language but also for an intimated Zombie lesbian seduction of the confused Anglia.  The usual low budget criticisms of bad sound and lack luster acting (excepting Ramsden and Nelson) apply.
 One hour and 58 minutes in the version that I reviewed.  There are other, shorter versions out there.",1419206400,,4032,4.485557083906465

8261080,3,B00166FBSS,"With a name like ""Zombies Anonymous,"" it's easy to overlook this curious movie as yet another schlocky zombie film.  And in many ways it is: there's plenty of neck biting, eyeball-popping, intestine-tearing, and even groin stabbing to keep any zombie fan entertained.  But ""Zombies Anonymous"" has higher fare in mind: domestic abuse.

Zombies are a known quantity in ""Zombies Anonymous.""  They are a new race, a new social class, a new oppressed group to be spat on, abused, and randomly killed in the street.  The zombies still feel -- they are not mindless killers -- but they're hardly human either, as their growing taste for raw meat slowly consumes them.  These contrary states of mind -- a civilized people thrust into a lower order -- are embodied by Angela (attractive Gina Ramsden) who is shot dead by her psychopathic boyfriend Josh (Joshua Nelson).  Months later, Angela must deal with a world in which she knows her murderer; and Josh must find his way where the past can physically come back to haunt him.

They both take different paths: Angela tries hard to fit in with ""Look-Alive"" makeup at her day job and visits a support group called ""Hugs for the Mortally Challenged"" at night. Josh joins a radical hate group with his friends, Richie (J. Scott Green), Peter ""Gooch"" Guccione (Gaetano Iacono) and Malcolm (Constantine Josiah Taylor). The group is led by a woman, The Commandant (Christa McNamee), who leads terrorist attacks on zombies.

But the zombies aren't innocent either.  Angela is introduced to a fringe group who believes in eating raw flesh, led by The Good Mother Mary Solstice (Mary Jo Verruto).  It's inevitable that these two groups will clash, with Angela and Josh caught in the middle.

Josh grapples with hating and loving his girlfriend, continuing the abusive spiral that led to her death.  He covets her and is disgusted by her -- and it's easy to see he felt this way before she was turned into a zombie.  Angela alternately tries to find her voice in a world where she no longer has to fear death.

The movie culminates in a face-off between the two belief systems, the two genders, and the two lovers.  Nobody, ""Zombies Anonymous"" tells us, really wins a war of ethos.  It's only at the end of the film that Angela learns being true to yourself is all that really matters, however imperfect (or dead) that might be.",1367193600,,2360,4.787654320987654
8261081,5,B00166FBSS,"I only bought this movie because Gina Ramsden is in it and I love her she is soo hott, I have bought all of her movies. Overall if your into Zombie movies this was a good movie in my opinion.",1351123200,,191,3.8
8261082,5,B00166FBSS,"Some really great effects and memorable characters.  True it is not an action-packed thrill ride with squealing guitars and tires, but with a title such as Zombies Anonymous what did you expect?  It is refreshing to finally get some zombie movies that aren't ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" with zombies... if i wanted military action movies i'd buy one... just so happens i wanted a simple zombie movie with no military in it - I FOUND ONE!!!  If you really like zombies this is at least worth seeing.  It still has some good action, gut munching and fights, and really good practical effects and makeup.",1345075200,,613,4.754716981132075
8261083,4,B00166FBSS,"I was pleasantly surprised at this movie, being in recovery myself.  So I was able to understand its humor.  Unfortunately the one thing that I thought was a bit overboard was the excessive swearing. My GF is not a prude but when I got it to show her (it had been sometime since i had seen it, & being blessed w/ADHD i sometimes miss out on certain elements of a movie), we maybe watched about 15 mins or so & she finally said enough. It was almost like being in a regular AA mtg at times. If you could remove every other word you can make out something close to what a person is trying to share. I am not judging them. Pls don't get me wrong. I used to swear as much as anyone. When I'd come home from the Marines on leave my mom would always be saying ""What did you just say?!"" & then it would hit me that I needed to watch my mouth (as an adult she could no longer use the ivory soap on me...i can still taste that stuff & my stomach starts to turn when i near the soap area...i have vivid flashbacks...much like the teargas chambers in bootcamp... :-  b/c it was like a 2nd language to me. But now that I don't, I find I am able to say much more in a shorter span (which is always a challenge for us ADH'ers) & people can understand...somewhat...what I am trying to say.
Anyways I thought the heroine Angela (Gina Ramsden, who I thought was Holly Hunter at 1st until i took time to put my glasses on & see more clearly, plus once I heard her voice knew it wasn't her, did an excellent job. I thought, for what they had for budget, actors/actresses, etc, I think it is a movie that was good. And maybe I am too idealistic about cutting the swearing, but it is just too prevalent. And for that matter, I am tired of hearing little kids swearing on the screen. They have enough challenge just being allowed to grow up as a child w/o being made to sound like adults. There are countless movies, excellent, where nudity & swearing were not needed to try & sell it as they were great on their own accord.
Alas I digress. The boyfriend just never got it, until he finally got it. Bravo for Angela walking away from him in the end. There are a lot of little things that make this a great little movie. The mix of prejudice on both sides of the coin, along w/the extremes of how sides are taken within each side (ie pacifism vs force, within each camp-the living & the...mortally challenged).
Pls know that even tho I wish the film did not have all the swearing, I do not hold it against anyone who doesnt hold the same ideals.  I do think it is a great little movie w/a very original theme. Have a great day.",1317600000,,2604,4.150495049504951
8261084,1,B00166FBSS,"This movie is just plain bad.

Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie, which also sucked, I was hoping for some needed zombie respite. Not happening here.

What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered. Frankly most lines and acting seemed like they belonged in a bad porno rather than a good zombie movie (neither of which is this movie).

It seems like whenever there was a lack of dialogue for a scene, it was simply replaced with profanity of all sorts.

I ended up turning this movie off half way through it, which I very rarely do. I felt the movie bored me, offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money.

If you want a ""good"" zombie movie, I don't think this is it.
