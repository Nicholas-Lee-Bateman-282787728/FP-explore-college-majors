5469409,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,This is a great movie and I have been looking for it for many years.  I can't wait to see it again.,1356220800,8,99,3.5
5469410,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,"This movie is called a Christmas movie, but execpt for the fact that the story takes place during the Christmas season, it's not really all that much of a Christmas story.  Neither Santa Claus nor Jesus are ever mentioned, there's only one present given and it's given in secret, and most of the forced ""we are given this holiday to remember what's really important"" is left out, though you do get that message anyway.  I used to see this movie on television every year and then suddenly it disappeared.  I had it on VHS and didn't care whether it showed on tv or not, until VHS started to go out of style and I couldn't find it on DVD.  But now it is available here and there and it's well worth watching.  The story is about a woman with two kids, one teen and the other two or three years younger.  Her husband runs a big department store, owned by his family for generations.  Suddenly, the economy is bad, they're about to lose the store AND the house, the kids are getting in fights (the boy, who's younger, starts them and the teen girl fights his battles for him), her mother has heart trouble and the romance has gone out of her marriage.  She longs for the past when everything was simpler, she still had dreams, her parents were still in the old home place and so she goes back there.  I won't spoil the story by telling you what happens, but it's a charming story.  If you like action, profanity, sex, fashionistas and all that, you probably won't like this movie, but if you too remember a better time, and sometimes long for it, you'll understand this woman perfectly.  Polly Holliday and Angela Lansbury turn in great performances, but then nearly everyone in the movie does and you may not want it to end!",1355961600,78,1721,4.431746031746032
5469411,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,"This is a fabulous holiday movie that focuses on the really true and important things that the holidays bring.  I watched this movie every year for three years when I was in high school and fell in love with it.  Then it dropped out of sight and I did not see it again for almost 20 years when I sought it out on the internet.

This movie has very special meaning to me.  I watch it ever year without fail.  Think how you would feel to be in Janet's shoes.  Failing business due to a struggling economy (not so different today huh?) the sudden loss of her mother and sinking into a deep depression.  The only place she wanted to go was home.  Home where she was embraced by her family and had time to reflect on where she had been and where she was going.  Time to realize that life is short and we only have a certain amount of time to focus on what is truly important.  Love and family.

Get this movie and watch it with your children.  Keep it on the shelf next to ""It's a Wonderful Life""  share it with the people who mean the most and understand what is important in this life.  You never know when you won't be able to tell someone that you love them, so do it right now!",1355875200,91,1177,4.08296943231441
5469415,3,B00AQ8IUJ4,"I'm not saying its not a good movie, but it is a drama and there is some sadness in it.  I think Angela Lansbury  is incredible in it and it's one of the reasons I watched the whole thing. The hidden message is to find your secret place. I hope I am not giving to much away by saying there is a dream sequence in it.",1512086400,,316,3.772727272727273

This Christmas movie, which he wrote the teleplay for, is somewhat like a combination of those two shows.  It's very heavy on family drama and love, yet has a bit of a Twilight Zone tone to it.  After her mother dies, the family business goes under, and her marital problems become too heavy to hide, Janet (Lee Remick) gets overwhelmed and depressed.  One day, though, her recently deceased mother suddenly appears in the house and tells her she has come to take her home. Outside is a sleigh waiting to take away Janet and her two children, and the man driving it is Janet's father.  Only, he's dead, too!  When they get to Janet's childhood home, who do they find waiting for them?  Why, it's Aunt Min, who is also dead!

Everyone looks quite healthy and alive, though, and the viewer does find out early on that Janet is only dreaming about returning home, but there still is a fantasy flavor to the movie.  Angela Lansbury is wonderful as Janet's mother, and pulls off lines that would seem downright mawkish if spoken by a less talented actress.  Yes, the movie is very much classic Hamner, with the rural setting and all the family drama and talk.  Polly Holiday is also superb as the aunt who never married, but who awaits a Christmas ""ghost"" with one red rose every year.  Lee Remick and the two children in the movie are okay, too; but the children don't look like they fit with their parents; and there are party and fireworks storylines involving them which seem totally out of place in this Christmas film. In addition, why the big unnecessary drama at the end, and why not a better final scene between Janet and her elders?  Was it supposed to be like Janet was looking at a live Christmas card or an old photograph?  Whatever, this is still a wonderful Christmas movie, well worth watching, mostly thanks to Angela Lansbury,",1511740800,,2372,5.571030640668524

Happy to say it is finally here on Amazon Video! Such a heartwarming, old-fashioned movie. And Lee Remick and Angela Landsbury are excellent. But my favorite character is the aunt, portrayed by Polly Holliday.

WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT
HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY
FILMS & SPECIALS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.

Janet (Lee Remick) feels she is losing so much...her beloved mother
(Angela Lansbury), the family business, maybe even her husband. Janet
dreams of Christmas in idyllic Vermont where her parents and spinster
aunt (Polly Holliday) may wait in holiday warmth. When more seems lost,
with her children in jeopardy, Janet searches for that 'secret place'
where we find what really matters.

Now Don't get me wrong this is not a bad film. Lee Remick is a great
actress and she was taken far too young. This film here however is not
the bast part she has ever played. Her character however she plays is
kind of distant and not really engaging in life. She seems to be an
observer of it.

As for television films go this one is good but it also ""Too
Predictable""! Family safe but most children will bored. Females will
like this more then men!",1505347200,,1151,4.524038461538462

5469510,4,B00AQ8IUJ4,"There is something so comforting about these types of movies from the 1980s. Although the script may be a bit slow-paced, and the message subtle, there is a sense of cozy, homey warmth and old-fashioned values that is not so easy to find anymore in many current films. I enjoyed it, and found it sweetly endearing.

I also found it to be a bit reminiscent, in a very far-stretched sort of way, to the old ""Scrooge"" tale.

Although the heroine of the story here is not an old, mean miser, she and her husband (both business folk, like good old Ebenezer) have rather lost their way over the years, and while they have been able to put on a decent front, the death of her mother and the loss of their business bring out the truth.

Something is not quite right anymore, and it shows.

But what is not right?

As many such tales go, it is something within THEM that needs changed, and so the story sets out to do just that.

While Scrooge was visited by three ghosts who helped set him straight again, the heroine has her deceased mother, father, aunt... and at the end, even a living, but somehow fictional, individual to fill the roles. In one way or another, they all help to guide her along to find the ""secret place"" her mother has told her about for many years, where her and her real husband can find happiness once more.

To be sure, I am not saying that this film is a spin-off of ""A Christmas Carol"" in the traditional sense. It stands far too much on its own to have such a direct comparison, and so please don't expect fantastical flights through time or old business partners in chains to show up, rattling as they go. No, the comparison that I draw here is highly subtle, and not everyone may see it.

But watch closely, and behind the variances in script and story line, you may see that at the end, it has a certain spirit in common with that old Dicken's tale. A belief that things can happen in life which are a bit beyond us to understand...but if we listen, we may hear something that matters, and can change our hearts.",1482796800,2,2036,4.339473684210526

5469576,3,B00AQ8IUJ4,"It's always a pleasure seeing Lee Remick. How ironic that Angela Lansbury, who plays her mother in this movie is, at 91, still very much alive, while Lee has been gone for 25 years! This movie will certainly pluck your heartstrings. But there is something about the script, with its stories within stories, that made me unable to come too close to the family and its problems. (The father and son's mediocre acting did not help.) By the end of the movie, a big dark cloud still hangs over their heads. 3 1/2 stars",1480982400,,513,4.468085106382978

5469674,3,B00AQ8IUJ4,"Was happy to see that this old TV special was available on DVD; I remembered it fondly largely for its New England setting.  Good acting by Angela Lansbury and Polly Holliday, but Remick is kind of wooden.  Picture quality is sorely lacking, but then this dates from the mid-80's.  They do at least look like real people without today's ultra-whitened teeth.  Earl Hamner wrote it, so if you liked The Waltons, you will like this.  It's a cut above today's Hallmark TV productions.",1420502400,,481,4.746987951807229

5469678,2,B00AQ8IUJ4,"Having actually lived in Chelsea, VT, the town where this film was made, I thought it would be fun to watch it during the Christmas holidays with our now grown up children. I recall that at the time it was made it caused quite a stir among the locals and was the big topic of conversation. My family recalled that two of the major stars in the film supposedly did not see eye to eye and that the owner at that time of one of the homes on the green that was prominently featured (the one that was always dark) refused to have his home's exterior upgraded by the movie company. We thought it'd be fun to see a good Christmas movie and maybe even see a few people and places that we knew years ago.
Aside from the fact that the reissued movie was slightly out of focus and the sound sort of blurred as well, we were all pretty disappointed with the story itself, although it was through no fault of the actors themselves who struggled valiantly with a rather thin storyline. I guess some films capture the period they are made or the era the story takes place, but ""The Gift of Love: ACS"" just seemed sadly outdated and the women seemed like caricatures of what women were expected to be then. I wonder about that though since the women I knew during those years did not seem to be so subservient.
Too bad that a beautiful setting and good actors were not put to better use. I'm sure though that some people would enjoy this rather romanticized tale and say it is ""Christmasy.""",1419811200,,1474,4.324909747292419

I watched it last night and still enjoyed it but found some of the acting style to be a little over dramatic.  I think maybe it is just a little outdated.  It would be so wonderful if this was remade with more modern techniques.  Such a nice storyline and little side plots make this capable of being something that could adapt up into a motion picture.

5469738,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,"Hi, I produced ""The Gift of Love: A Christmas Story"" and just made the DVD available, so I wanted to thank all the wonderful folks who've been looking for the movie & those who've bought it here. And I see there's been the occasional comment about picture quality, from those who might have expected the HD quality that we're used to these days, and I want to tell you why that wasn't possible. I only realized recently how much interest there still was after all these years among loyal fans of the movie such as you (which I greatly appreciate). And because of the situation involved in making the movie back then, it was never released officially on DVD or VHS. So I wanted to make the best version available to people that I could. Alas the original film negative is long lost to the years, and without it an HD conversion wasn't possible. But this does come from the best production tape still existing (which is quite a bit better than VHS recordings), though when original elements are lost, it's hard to appear as beautiful as we might like on our great new HD TV's. I am continuing to see if I can improve that a bit with new technologies. I hope the movie will continue to bring you & your families much enjoyment.

5469744,4,B00AQ8IUJ4,"Maybe it's because I'm a native New Englander myself, that I caught a little (conscious or not) acting move that Massachusetts born Lee Remick employed in this made-for-television film from the early '80s.  Her character,  Janet Broderick, is a Vermonter transplanted, after marriage, to Elyria, Ohio, where her husband owns a department store.  After a series of personal setbacks (including the death of her mother and the closing of said store due to changing consumer habits),  she falls into deep depression AND an equally deep sleep,  wherein she has an elaborate dream in which she returns 'home' to the Vermont of her youth.  In the process, she gets her New England accent back, to the point where the woman she initially addresses as ""Ant Min"" becomes ""Ahnt Min,"" authentic New England style.  It's a deft touch--and given Lee's own heritage--MIGHT have been completely unconscious, but demonstrates keen intuition on her part.  It's a subtle sign that the character herself is ""going home"" on a psychological or perhaps even spiritual level.

And speaking of the actress's own personal background--and how it may have informed her performance in this film--I wonder if she was, at least in part, drawn to this role given that her own real-life dad owned a department store, Remick's, in Quincy, Mass.

Miss Remick's capable performance is matched by that of Angela Lansbury, as Janet's mother, Amanda, and Polly Holliday as her maiden aunt Minerva.  Each actress has her moment to shine, although Polly Holliday has been justly singled out for her touching performance of ""Aunt Min"" who had known real love (and treasures it still), although circumstances (and her family) prevented her from marrying the only man she would ever give her heart to.  It could have been one hoary old cliche, but Polly Holliday's understated performance and Delbert Mann's sympathetic direction moves it beyond all that.

Reportedly,  Polly Holliday sought out roles that would let audiences see that there was more to her artistry than her break out role of ""Flo"" on TV's ALICE (and the spinoff, FLO) would have suggested.  Mostly, that meant a return to the stage where she had initially found acclaim, but a role such as the dyed-in-the-wool Yankee, Min, certainly must have helped serve as something of a corrective against such typecasting as well.

The star quality of the female leads is pretty darn impressive, but their male counterparts--whom many viewers will recognize if not be able to identify--acquit themselves well too.  Joseph Warren who plays Remick's father was a native of Massachusetts had the accent down.  He also managed to embody the characteristically laconic, pragmatic, but loving New England patriarch about as well as any actor could.  As Janet husband,  veteran television actor Mart Hulswit has many good moments,  although too much of his dialog is underwritten.  And character actor Michael Higgins makes the best of his limited screen time as Aunt Min's one-time beau,  who pays a visit each Christmas Eve to deliver his former love a single rose.

Given the rushed pace of most TV projects, it's not too surprising that the child actors are a little on the awkward side.  Aside from a few natural born actors,  most kids need fairly extensive coaching to act naturally onscreen.  I imagine that the Academy Award winning director (for MARTY) Delbert Mann could have coaxed better performances from the children had he had the time to work with them.  Luckily, one child is at that awkward age of 13 anyway--and the other is a bit of a nerd.  You could say their awkwardness is dramatically justified.

If you read some of the reviews of this film on various online sites, you know that it's been a sentimental favorite among many viewers for many years--and that there was considerable demand for a DVD release.  It actually was run as a somewhat regular seasonal broadcast for several years after its first run in 1983 before it disappeared.  The current DVD is not exactly HD quality, since--as seems to be the case with most television films--no master film or negative was preserved.  That's a shame, since much of the camera work looks to be quite good, but I doubt that fans of this film will mind too much.  I suspect for them,  its availability is Chrismas miracle enough.",1387670400,5,4309,4.979020979020979
5469745,4,B00AQ8IUJ4,"This is a wonderful story about valuing family, and getting a second chance to make family a priority.  The DVD is poor quality, as it has not been digitally remastered from the VHS version. I have watched it for years on a VHS tape that I recorded when it was on tv years ago, and was excited to get it on DVD.  However, the only improvement was that it doesn't jump and flicker on the screen like the tape did.  If it's ever remastered, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",1387670400,,465,4.144444444444445

Snowy Vermont village square welcomes home Janet (Lee Remick) a woman who has lost her sense of self. Her marriage to Neil (Mark Hulswit) is floundering, her 13 year old tomboy daughter Dorothy (Samantha Atkins) is constantly coming home with black eyes, her gifted 8 year old son Michael (Michael Pearlman) provokes local bullies with taunts of ""dummy"" with predictable results, and suddenly her mother dies. Slipping into a deep depression, she falls into a dream of returning home to her parents Amanda (Angela Lansbury) and Spence ""my Old Citizen"" (Joseph Warren) long married farmers who raise their own geese for Christmas and who have created a Secret Place sanctuary for their marriage when the world seems too much to handle. Unmarried Aunt Minerva (Polly Holliday) resides at the farm with Janet's parents. Hanibal (Michael Higgins) runs the local one room general store, his grandson Russell (Alexander Harrington) is residing with him and his wife Abigail (Janet Peterson) since his parents divorced and neither wants him.

5469766,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,"A wonderful Christmas story in a fable format.  At one time or another in our lives many of us pause to reflect on our decisions made or not made.  These especially seem to surface in the wake of tragedy or difficult circumstances beyond our control.  In a nostalgic look back, Lee Remick's character travels back ""home"" during a long sleep brought on by a severe depression.  Here she is safe to look over her life and revisit with her loved ones who have passed on.  The scenes with Polly Holliday as her Aunt ""Min"" are especially touching (i.e. the visit from the ""Christmas Ghost"")... This is a wonderfully acted and extremely lovely presentation that is just the right length in viewing time as well as gets you right in the heart and though it is not specifically a ""Christian"" movie, it does give the message that ""All things are possible with God...""  My favorite scene is the one where Lee Remick's character Janet is listening to her Father Spence give a talk when she is just about to walk down the aisle---the words he says about a married couple and how he felt are just beautiful without being ""schmaltzy""... All in all, I enjoy seeing this movie every year and am so glad it is legally available now from Amazon, since they seemed to have stopped showing it on tv anymore.... and it seemed to take quite a long time for them to come out with it!  I am very glad with my purchase of this semisweet movie.",1384128000,3,1418,4.4728682170542635

8556256,5,B00AQ8IUJ4,"It seems that i recent decades Christmas films are usually very light fare. If not out and out comedies like Elf, they're one of the numerous Rom-com Christmas films. So this film from the early 80's stood out immediately to me for its serious issues despite a fair amount of comic moments thrown in. The Broderick family is suddenly hit with a storm of crises from financial woes and a couple who have grown distant to a death in the family. All of this is presented not as a soap opera or tearjerker but in a more matter-of fact way as life events that can happen to any family. The story is announced in the beginning as a fable, which is defined as something we know in our hearts to be true. It also means that much of it might not exactly correspond with everyday reality, that times and places may jump back and forth and that there may be dreamlike elements as well.

The cast obviously is excellent. Lee Remick as Janet Broderick is totally believable as the caring but overwhelmed mother who is the central character of the film. I was concerned at first that Angela Lansbury's role would be brief and that she was only there as window-dressing but in fact she's almost as important a character as Amanda Fenwick as Remick is as her daughter. Polly Holiday is the spinster aunt and is as good in the role as Sara Haden had been as Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy films. Both played these roles not as a caricature but in a sensitive way that reveals them as full human beings. Holiday and Lansbury both received Emmy nominations for their performances. The supporting cast is up to their roles, even the two children.

The film was made in 1983 and was set in that time period but there's nothing of the 80's in it: no MTV, no Michael Jackson or Eurythmics. In fact the way it unfolds it seems to be in its own world of a vaguely contemporary time any time that could be virtually any period in the last fifty or sixty years. In fact when Aunt Min and the kids are sent to the local store for ingredients for Amanda's burnt orange cake, the store is right out of the 1940's, the kind of store where you tell the clerks at the counter what you want and they go and get it. In the 1980's I'm sure even small Vermont towns had their supermarkets but that's part of the mystery here, how eras seem to be blended. The primary Vermont  setting is perfect for a Christmas movie with its picture perfect village green covered with snow and centered with a New England white -spired church (Chelsea, Vermont, which I think i've seen used in other films).

As the film progresses, Janet has to reach deep within herself to find the faith and strength to carry on and begin to put things back together again. Hers is a deeper truth than the usual Christmas film's urging to be nicer and more giving.
