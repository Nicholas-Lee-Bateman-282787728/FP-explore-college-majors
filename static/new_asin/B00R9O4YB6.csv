6925220,4,B00R9O4YB6,"This was an easy four stars. And if someone gave it 5 stars, I would understand. For the budget they likely spent, it is superb! I'd like to know what this cost. It shows how you can still make a great movie for not a lot of money. Filmed in Saskatchewan Canada. And most every actor is Canadian or from Minnesota (same thing).

Great story of your past coming back on you....just when you don't need it to. I don't ever recall a movie where all the characters keep referring to the past, but the story never completely fills it in for the viewer. And yet it's quite OK. Writer-director Jefferson Moneo pulls it off perfectly.

One of my favorite aspects is that there might have only been nine speaking parts, and three of those roles had only a few lines (girlfriend, enforcer, and cop).

Better yet, the roles were not over-directed or over-acted (I hate that). The 'old, cranky dad' is often an over acted role. Not here. Sometimes when you are *really* angry, you don't yell an f-bomb, but say it quietly. And many times directors over-do the small-town feel. Not here. And when female leads get scared, they sometimes over-do it. Not here. Even the ex-con doesn't over-do the 'angry ex-con' role.

Nadia Litz plays a perfect balance of mom, fear, bad girl, and bad daughter. And too many female leads these days have perfect, super-model features. They did a good job of having Nadia look the part; sometimes a bit skanky and sometimes sexy.

Some people say it's like 'No County for Old Men.' That movie was gratuitously violent. This one is not. The violence is when things just go horribly wrong, and never planned.

Characters surprise you. And the ending is not what I expected. And they leave out just the right amount info to make your imagination work.",1433548800,4,1766,4.60828025477707

6925222,4,B00R9O4YB6,"Intriguing story, not sure where it is going. The story was rich, characters full. All played their parts well. I give 5 stars to documentary mostly, could almost do it here.",1430265600,,174,4.645161290322581
6925223,5,B00R9O4YB6,"As more than one critic has mentioned, ""Big Muddy"" is a combination of ""No Country for Old Men"" and just enough ""Fargo"" to make you laugh where you really shouldn't. There's nothing like a terrible past to keep creating problems for one family's present and future. Highly recommended!",1424304000,4,285,4.958333333333333

6925225,2,B00R9O4YB6,"Don't know why this movie was made. It was not worthy of a 1-star, but I feel I wasted my time...hoping it would get better. The acting was good enough, but the story wasn't that interesting. Seemed like a bunch of individual scenes melded together without much of a flow. Three men in the main character's life, but you don't know much about them. Just that they are bad characters from her past. I felt the few action scenes were hokey.",1448150400,,438,4.419753086419753

6925233,4,B00R9O4YB6,Good acting and plot with a trippy Quentin Tarantino vibe that is delightfully country western retrohip/grifter/gangster. This is a slow burn that has twists and turns and intermingled plot lines that keep you guessing until they come together in the end. Underrated gem. Recommended.,1439510400,,284,5.4772727272727275

Martha had to over-come certain situations to protect her family position. This is a great book for anyone ages 15-100.
Once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down. I would recommend this book to all of my family and friends. I'm sure they will all enjoy it as much as I did.",1463616000,,379,4.277777777777778
