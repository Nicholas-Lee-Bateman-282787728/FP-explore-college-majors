8602483,5,B00E8G5I0Y,"How great is it to see some of these old games, or at least a portion of them (as they only have highlights for the oldest of the games and nothing from the 1930's)
Definitely recommended for any fan of old time baseball and/or a Cardinal fan.
Just wished that had a closed caption option, I'd love to show these to my Grandparents, who are in their mid 90's and actually saw some of these games, but they can't hear the TV.",1413331200,5,424,4.182926829268292
