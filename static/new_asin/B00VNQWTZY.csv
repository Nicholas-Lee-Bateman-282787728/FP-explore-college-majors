It covers more than two-thirds of the Earth.  Its power is tremendous.  Its importance to life, unquestioned.  But now, something is changing in the sea, threatening some of our planets most spectacular treasures.  And attacking the oceans fundamental web of life.

Scientists are in a race against time to discover the real risks and come up with solutions.  Off a remote island, an amazing discovery: a spot that could hold the key to our future.

Can we crack the code of a rapidly changing ocean to understand what it means for life before its too late?

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this extremely informative documentary.

The narrator tells us that something is changing in the sea.  That something thats changing is the waters chemistry.  Whats causing this change?  Answer: the extra carbon dioxide that were dumbing into the Earths atmosphere.  This extra carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans.

What does this mean for ocean life?  Its being negatively affected.  And this in turn negatively affects humans.

This film explains (quite well) whats happening to the oceans water chemistry. (Ive just given a very brief summary).  Then we get to follow scientists as they seek solutions to this seemingly unsolvable problem.

Finally, throughout this documentary, brief but important comments are given by experts.  Besides the excellent scientific information imparted to the viewer, there is also impressive photography and film footage.

In conclusion, this is the documentary to get if you want to know whats happening to our oceans and what scientists are doing to understand and perhaps solve this perplexing problem!!

8710692,5,B00VNQWTZY,"Another well done, honest documentary from the Nova series... ""Nova: Lethal Seas""  delves into modern challenges and dangers placed on the worlds oceans and its marine life. Especially the decline hazards faced by shellfish and the coral reef. It goes in-depth into a little known but serious threat that deserves awareness and more recognition... and interviews scientists who are at the forefront of analyzing and tackling the problem. SPOILER ALERT!! (If you read on further, some exact plot and details will be revealed)... Lethal Seas starts out by covering the environmental impact we humans have on the modern world. Then it goes into the obvious ecologically damaging side-effects created by fossil fuels on the ozone layer. This is the platform for the surprising revelations to the rest of the documentary! The depletion of ozone is not just occurring in the air, but also in the ocean water!! (Or, to be more accurate... it affects the chemistry of the ocean water). This, it turns out, affects shellfish's ability to use calcium to form their shells after they're born and in their early development. Significant numbers die in their infancy. This documentary goes on to reveal how this phenomenon directly impacts the coral reefs, and indirectly impacts all the world's marine life. There are a host of scientists who shed deeper light on the dilemma throughout the program. And, the viewer is helped to appreciate that unless this problem is slowed down, halted, and/or reversed... the extinction of dreadfully significant number of oceanic species will greatly hasten. In fact, the process is already somewhat underway! And... although it never directly addresses it, it looms another deadly byproduct of the Oil industry's blind and callous greed! Compounded by their efforts to oppose, stifle or stall the development of conversion to alternative fuels... and hold the world's transportation industries hostage. All to the ever increasing detriment of the environment (and as this documentary helps reveal), the deceptive decay of environmental conditions. There is plenty more knowledge and entertainment to be found in this DVD beyond what's said in this review. So, by all means, see it for yourself.",1448668800,,2220,5.271186440677966
8710693,5,B00VNQWTZY,"The PBS Documentary, Lethal Seas, warns of the oceans inexorable path toward an ecological disaster.  When we burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the air.  Everyday, about 1/4th of this gas, 30 million metric tons, is absorbed into the oceans, which changes the chemistry and raises the acidity.  For 40 years, scientists have been measuring this acidity and it has been rising about 5% every decade.  This Documentary follows scientists as they unearth the changes this acidity makes to coral reefs and the marine animals that live there.  According to the Documentary, Coral reefs are home to 1/4th of all marine species and  a billion people live from this food source.  Tiny creatures live in and around coral reefs and they are at the bottom of the food chain, so if they die off, then presumably this would threaten all the animals up the food chain.  Scientists have already discovered that the changing chemistry of the oceans is impacting the lives of these tiny animals.  This does not bode well for marine animals, but also, ultimately, for the human race.

8710694,5,B00VNQWTZY,"CARBON DIOXIDE absorbed by the ocean gets dissolved by the water in the ocean and forms a week acid called CARBONIC ACID which immediately breaks apart releasing hydrogen ions that are hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons and that is what increases water acidity with devastating effect on marine life especially with shell fish. Baby oysters build their shells by pulling calcium and carbonate from the surrounding waters and combining them into a tough matrix called calcium carbonate. Too much carbon dioxide in the mix alters that carbonate. There is plenty of calcium in the ocean but limited amount of carbonate. When acidity rises and there are lots more hydrogen ions floating around, it reacts with carbonate by taking away that essential ingredient carbonate needed by the coral reefs.

Shell killed any shell fish there was in the Gulf of Mexico with their oil spill although paid out some 50 plus billion dollars which will not remove the oil from the bottom of ocean that leaked for straight three months into the Gulf of Mexico and then there is hardly any oysters coming out of East Coast like it used either although there is no oil leak there. In California, they will not allow a ban on the grocery plastic bags since they claim such ban will cost jobs in CA meanwhile they claim that they have the highest standards so they have almost closed any energy producing plant regardless if it is nuclear or fossil but yet they all join in and pollute by dumping sewer, trash and chemicals in Oceans. If you could hold California residents accountable for their actions so their energy had to be produced right there in their own valley, preferably in Beverly Hills, not outside California as well as stop polluting Pacific Ocean, then probably we Americans could go around and tell the world to control their carbon dioxide. While trashing their own environment but telling others to behave is the real reasoning why there will be drilling in the Arctic, not anything else.",1431648000,3,1992,4.858823529411764
