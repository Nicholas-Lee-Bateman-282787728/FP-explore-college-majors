8156746,1,B000KGH02A,"Complete garbage. No menu or special features, just starts movie as soon as you put the disk in dvd player. Then the beginning seems to be missing as it starts with robbing a store. Then it turns off when its over without credits rolling. The description is wrong because there is no sex just some brief nudity. Waste of money. Just threw it in the trash.",1455235200,,355,4.393939393939394
8156747,1,B000KGH02A,"The one star is NOT for audio, the band's performance, or the way the shows were filmed. The one star is for poor video quality and false description. This DVD, based on the description, is supposed to contain footage from two shows that Megadeth played: One concert that was filmed in Italy around 1992 and another concert that was filmed in Brazil around 2011, and keep in mind, you're not getting the complete shows. Several songs are missing. What sucks more about this DVD is that you get the show from Brazil but not the show from Italy. Instead, what you get is footage taken from Hammersith, London in 1992; the same footage taken from the Warchest box set DVD, except the songs are switched around, two songs are missing, and the video quality is poor compared to the Warchest DVD. It looks like someone downloaded the show from youtube and burned on them onto a DVD. The show from Brazil has the same poor video quality. I understand this is an unauthorized DVD, and you can't expect unauthorized concert DVDs to be top quality, but I've bought other unauthorized concert DVDs that are 15 times better than this. This is a poor excuse for a Megadeth DVD.",1363996800,2,1164,4.600961538461538
