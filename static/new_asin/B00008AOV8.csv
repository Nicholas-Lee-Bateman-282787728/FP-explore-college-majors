Shotgun questions Anderson about the shipping records. Keeler and Slade plan to get rid of Shotgun as he seems friendly to Granny Carson. Gabby meets his daughter!

Brett explains how he figured it out. The stagecoach is attacked but its guards shoot at the robbers. Men fall. The robbers return to town and hide for an ambush. But Brett and Gabby know their plans and surprise them! Martinez arrives to free Cassidy and Crowley, who will try to shoot Brett and Gabby, who arrest Slade and Keeler.

This combines a story of an undercover operation, an attempt to swindle a family out of their valuable property, and a case of mistaken identity into an interesting budget movie with a complicated story. It seems to have some scenes edited out.",1510185600,,2377,4.665871121718377

Runtime is close to original so not a lot of cutting. Video quality is blurry, certainly not crisp but watchable (just).  If you are a Rob Roy fan and can pick this up for a buck or 2 then probably worth it.",1489622400,,336,4.25

7981338,4,B00008AOV8,"First off, it's a typical Alpha reproduction - the only down side to this DVD that I care to look for since there are so many pluses to the movie. Hey, at least they're putting this stuff out there.
  ""Ridin' On a Rocky Road"" is a good western song and fits in the movie more than most songs in singing cowboy westerns. Gabby plays Gabby Whitaker again and Sally Payne, who is delightful in her natural-gal way as she always is, plays his daughter. Her stage name is Queeny LaTour. Harry Woods does a bang-up job as the bad guy. You can tell this is one of Roy's earlier pictures since he has only one gun and no huge flowers on his shirt. I love those shirts, actually, and would love to have one - fashion be damned.
  The plot revolves  around the bad guys trying to steal Granny Carson's fledgling mine,  and Tombstone has to learn respect for the law. As in all of Roy's movies, the story is better than average. The acting is better than average. Roy always did his best - no simple reading of lines like you get with a lot of these guys. Gabby steals every scene he's in, as always. You just gotta love Gabby, there's no one better.
  A 6-horse stage! One way to tell it's a B-western is that it has a 4-horse stage. Proof Roy's B-westerns were better than most B-westerns. And hey, there's the rock formation where Captain Kirk fought the lizard guy! And guess what - Roy loses his hat and it stays lost. Talk about realism.
  Happy trails, partners.

Overall for the price you can't expect too much, but the film is worth buying and watching. Hopefully more titles will be released.
From what I have in my collection so far, this budget series are unlike more expensive labels, uncut versions
and you do a decent DVD cover.",1049068800,2,452,4.267441860465116
