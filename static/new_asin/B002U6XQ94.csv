3988359,1,B002U6XQ94,"I love CREED!I saw them five times! They really know how to rock! But whomever put this DVD together did a horrible job, the Music sounds so bad and very unclear due to the sound recording in my opinion. And there is no bass whatsoever..even after I crank it up on my Onkyo stereo system and anyone who knows Creed, knows they play with tons of bass! Also in my opinion they never properly filmed the entire stage and the back drop of the stage..which was a record breaking stage presence with numerous lights and effects ect.. Creed got shanked! They claim to have 239 video cameras filming but the whole DVD is nothing but upclose shots of Scott Stapp. Which of course he did a great job! In my opinion the people who filmed this DVD did such a horrible job of not capturing the entire stage presence..and all the special effects. Just Terrible! Creed should demand their money back!!!",1260576000,4,887,4.515527950310559
3988360,5,B002U6XQ94,Watching the DVD makes me feel as if I was in Houston for the show.  The camera work is amazing and the sound really good.,1260489600,,122,3.88
3988361,5,B002U6XQ94,"Honestly, Creed will never be the same band as they were in their prime in the early 2000's, nor should they be expected to be.  I saw them twice in that time frame for the Human Clay tour and the Weathered tour.  They were indoubtedly the two best concerts I've seen - and I've seen a ton. I also saw them in August of this year, and they haven't lost much. Their new music shows their growth and maturing as a band.  This DVD is well produced and is well recorded, both visually and from an audio perspective. Scott Stapp will never sound quite as good as he did in his glory days, but he does give an honest and soulfull performance.  The band still sounds excellent, and this DVD does capture the power, energy, and spiritual performance of Creed.  If you are a longtime Creed fan, and have seen them in concert, this DVD will give you a chance to relive some of the awesome moments of their concerts. What's This Life For alone is worth the price of this DVD. I picked this DVD up yesterday, along with some cold ones on the way home from work/turned up the bass and played it as loud as my system would allow, and it truly captured alot of what a Creed concert is. Yes it would have been nice to have a DVD of their Human Clay or Weathered tour, but this production is well done and effective. For Creed fans, it is definitely a must have.",1260489600,,1345,4.217898832684825
3988362,2,B002U6XQ94,I purchase music DVD all the time of my favorite bands. There are some that are put together right and then there are one like this one that someone did not do a good job editing the sound.  There is just way too much bass sound which makes it hard to hear the lyrics that Scott is singing.,1260489600,,290,4.0
3988363,4,B002U6XQ94,"This show was filmed right here in my hometown of Houston just a little over 2 months ago. I very much wanted to go to this show, but I was trying to save money and talked myself out of it since I had already seen Creed 4 times (many years before). As my luck would have it, the show was forever captured and released here on DVD. Anyway, I was impressed at the quality of the DVD, it looks sharp, has tasteful editing, and a respectable amount of bonus features. Still, if Creed were to put out a live DVD, I wish they had chosen a performance from their Human Clay tour or Weathered tour. Creed was a well-oiled machine back then and consistantly delivered some of the best concerts I'd ever seen, and while they are still good (the band in particular), this isn't their best.

The musicianship of the band seems as good as ever. Mark Tremonti is an especially gifted guitar player who delivers some sweet yet modest solos. However, singer Scott Stapp seems a bit rough. In the past he always sounded as good as the albums, and on the band's newest album (Full Circle) he belted it out as well, but he sounds like he's struggling ever so slightly at this show. He seems to have trouble hitting some of the higher notes on just a couple occasions, and his deep voice often sounds exaggerated. Still, it's an overall solid performance and I enjoyed watching it, especially with the excellent song selection. My only complaint is that ""Ode"" and ""Rain"" didn't make the setlist, but it was worth it to hear a lot of old favorites that I wasn't expecting. While this may not be as good as a Creed show from 10 years ago, it's still a lot of fun and I'd recommend it.",1260403200,9,1662,4.361290322580645

3988367,5,B002U6XQ94,"I was at this concert, and it was AMAZING! The performance was beautiful, and it was obvious that Stapp and the boys (Scott 'Flip' Phillips, Brian Marshall, Mark Tremonti, Eric 'EROCK' Friedman) gave it their all! The touring guitarist, Eric 'EROCK' Friedman, was full of energy! The pyro was flippin' off the chain! The level of energy at that concert was through the roof, and the whole time I was wishing that it would NEVER end! Scott Stapp (lead singer) was all over the stage, singing his heart out! Mark Tremonti (lead guitarist) was headbanging throughout the whole show, while shredding his tush off at the same time. Brian Marshall (bassist), Well, I swear, that boy was BORN to play bass! Scott 'Flip' Phillips (drummer) was grinning like an idiot most of the time, lettin' loose and playin' those drums like there was no tomorrow! The rhythm of the whole thing was amazing, of course. Eric 'EROCK' Friedman (touring rhythm guitarist, acoustic guitar, and mandolin player)added multiple little things to the songs and experience that made a HUGE difference. They played the classics, the hits, and some new stuff, too. They've still got their AMAZING song writing talents!! Mark Tremonti has gotten A LOT better (he was already INSANELY talented!) at guitar playing. The new songs made it seem like they had never left us. They never missed a beat, and Stapp never missed a lyric! (Well, unless you count changing 'he' to 'they' in With Arms Wide Open, due to the fact that he now has two beautiful children. :D) I could go on and on about how mind bogglingly amazing the show was, but then I'd be here all day! So, I'll leave you with this, if you are considering buying this, BUY IT! If you aren't, you're crazy! BUY IT! CREED is back, and BETTER THAN EVER!!!",1259452800,16,1772,4.719354838709678

3988455,3,B002U6XQ94,"Three stars for great picture, smooth editing, solid (if a bit treble-heavy) sound, and 3/4ths of Creed in fine form (their extra guitarist adds a lot as well). Scott Stapp's performance, however, borders on awful. I realize the man was never a powerhouse singer, but here he sounds abnormally bad, as if his voice was shot that particular night. In addition to dodging any high notes, he's frequently off-key and even off-beat a couple of times, and shouts through most of the songs as if trying to just power through it. I guess the expansive production made postponing the show or the filming impossible, but it seems they didn't even try to fix his vocals in post-production (normally I'd be against that sorta thing, but believe me, this DVD could have used it). A shame really since Creed is usually a better band than their many critics would have you believe, but this DVD won't do them any favors.",1352678400,,906,4.70440251572327
3988456,5,B002U6XQ94,"I have LOVED this band since I first heard the song ""Higher"".  I can't get enough of this DVD.  I saw reviews that said Scott's voice was terrible.  I beg to differ!  The first song was not his best, but the rest of the video was AWESOME!!!  I also highly recommend his book, ""Sinner's Creed"".",1352505600,,293,4.254545454545455
3988457,4,B002U6XQ94,"Creed put on an Awesome Show, but I just wish it was Alter Bridge!

3988494,5,B002U6XQ94,First of all let me say that I completely agree with the issues with the audio especially at the beginning but this seems to be a problem with most concert videos recorded in this format. I run 5.1 surround ( DTS ) and because of that you are going to get the lead vocals coming mainly through the center channel just as you would a movie but in this case the first song the vocals are way up so it sounds strange ( sort of like if he was in a vocal booth in a studio ). The rest of the concert is right on vocally and especially musically in my opinion. I am not going to sit here and say he can not sing and vocals are horrible as in my many years of seeing live bands you will definitely get a different quality of show each night some good some not so good. Live shows are fueled by emotion and atmospheric vibe so they are definitely not gong to sound exactly like the record. If you want to hears songs performed exactly like the recorded version pop in a CD and listen to it instead. I feel you will not be disappointed in this purchase especially if you have been a creed fan from the beginning ( yeah 14 years ago... ). The visuals and music are excellent in my opinion!! You tube has some of the concert footage on their site in case you are still on the fence about this guy still being able to sing....Enjoy,1324512000,,1319,4.076923076923077
3988495,5,B002U6XQ94,Believe me Scott Stapp is awesome live. There was probably something wrong with the audio or something on the recording.,1312416000,,120,5.05
3988496,3,B002U6XQ94,"We purchased this Blu-ray 3 days ago.  Me and my husband loves Creed since our college days and we are disappointed when we knew that they disbanded. So when they were reunited we are all excited.  During the time when Creed was broken into two (Alterbridge and Scott Stapp), I have seen Alterbridge as Creed except for the sleepy voice of their vocals and on the other hand Scott hired a very lousy band to play for him.  On that time I already noticed Scott's voice is already damaged.  He cannot sing a song without transposing 1/2 or 1 note chords in all his songs.  When we were out and saw this Blu-ray I really wished it was a compilation of their old Live concerts but when we see some songs from the new album we knew this will not be a good concert to watch because I know Scott's voice capacity. Anyways we bought it and played it and yes, it is very disappointing.  The vocals were so so so bad.  I hate the beat because they played all songs one beat faster than the recorded one.  Keys of lower.  Scott Philips also lost his passion in drumming and I still love his spills.  Only Tremonti and Marshall are still good but in general.

It's a shame that they decided to record this and sell even though they knew Scott's performance is bad.  I wish they made a compilation of old creed's concert instead of this one.",1303084800,,1328,4.310483870967742
3988497,4,B002U6XQ94,"The last time I saw Creed was many years ago at the Continental Arena in East Rutherford, NJ. Their live performance at that time was top notch and definitely raised the bar for this current blu ray video. I have always loved Scott Stapp's powerful vocals but something was off with this concert. When Creed kicked off the concert with ""Bullet"", Scott was off tune with the vocals. This seemed to continue throughout the show where instead of sounding natural, he sounded strained. Nonetheless, I would kill to have this vocal power and talent.

The quality of this video is top notch and the camera work is spectacular. The DTS Master sound puts you right in the middle of all the music. You need to crank this one up and make sure your sub is at its max.

Despite my earlier comments, Creed is spectacular and a must see for anyone who loves rock with great vocals and instrumentation. I will always love Scott's voice because it is awesome and makes me feel overwhelmed with emotion. The lyrics are inspiring for anyone who is looking for redemption and wanting to learn about life and all its lessons.

If you are a fan of Creed, check out Scott's solo work and the split off group, Alter Bridge. Together or apart, this is rock at its very best.",1300665600,,1250,4.522123893805309
3988498,1,B002U6XQ94,"The concert looks great.  But the sound is terrible.  I've seen the reviews that put it on the lead singer.  Maybe he was off, but the biggest problem is that they have his vocals turned way up, while at the same time having the guitar turned down.  The bass is nice and hard, but way out of balance with the guitar, and the vocals have a nasally quality to them.  I believe they were having mix problems at the concert itself because in the 5.1 mix you can actually here during some of the songs them turning the mike off when Strapp isn't singing.  You can actually here the audio cut off, like they were trying to correct this.  Also if you watch Strapps body language he seems frustrated by something at various times, and I'd bet it was the audio.  But I don't believe its his voice that is the problem.  He is not Steve Perry, or Michael Bolton or someone like that, where you would want his vocals at a higher level versus the rest of the band.  He is an adequate singer who should be mixed in at a lower level.  I played it in 2.0 mix which is just dreadful as well.  Everything just runs together like it is a very old recording.  So whoever mixed the audio on this thing ought to have been fired.  It is such a same because anybody buying bluray concerts right now are seeing countless disapointments with either the sound, or picture quality, or both.  Only about half the concerts being released are getting it right.  I hope they re-mix the audio on this thing, and then tell everybody.",1299628800,2,1499,4.318996415770609
3988499,1,B002U6XQ94,"I was excited to get this blu ray as I love concerts in blu ray.  I watched/listened to 3 songs and was actually embarrassed.  Embarrassed that I bought it and they should be for putting this crap out.  I could barely make out a word he was screaming in his off key out of tune ""voice"".  I will just remember them the way they were and melt this plastic in my fire pit.

I will add that the Amazon reviews of the Creed blu ray originally led me to Airborne Toxic Event so I bought that blu ray also.  I had never heard of them before and my one word review of that blue ray is:  Brilliant.",1299369600,,589,3.982905982905983
3988500,3,B002U6XQ94,"Well, I am a big Creed and Alterbridge fan. As you can tell by that statement, I love the band members no matter who fronts lead vocals for them. Mark Tremonte is one of the most brilliant lead-rock guitarists ever to grace the stage. However, I don't know what happened to Scott Stapp's voice but, in my opinion, he is treading on dangerous ground. He's obviously trying to create more of a mature-powerful voice. Maybe his goal is to sound more like Alterbridge but he's trying too hard. Besides, they're Creed not Alterbridge. As a result, he comes into his songs a clear octive too low and bottoms out on virtually every song performed. He was completely off key. I was embarrassed for the band. They need to convince him to stick with his natural voice which is what worked for them in the first place. As an audio buff, I love powerful bass presence but the sound mixing on this disc left a lot to be desired. All you heard was bass and LFE effect with very weak vocal volume as well as guitar. Would I recommend this DVD? Of course; if you're a Creed or Alterbridge fan. However, they need to get back to basics on Scott's vocals if they want to be welcomed back with open arms.

3988540,5,B002U6XQ94,"I've been a Creed fan since the release of their debut album ""My Own Prison"".  The knockout combination of Stapp's voice along with Tremonti's passion and soul on guitar, as well as his own amazing voice on backup vocals was enough to have me hooked. (Okay, really it was Tremonti but Stapp grew on me!)  I was fearful of their new CD as well as this DVD because I had seen nothing but shady comments about Stapp's ""new"" voice.  What's the problem folks?  Stapp had a cyst removed from his vocal cords and of course that's going to change things but I can honestly say I really love the way his voice is now.  It's a little grittier, more edgy - just as passionate as before.  The addition of Eric Friedman on guitar is pretty awesome - adds his own flair on vocals.  I like that they've gone a little bit ""harder"" in the rock direction - Full Circle is an excellent purchase and addition to my collection.  I absolutely love the DVD - since I've seen them in concert and it ranks up in the top three favorites of mine.  It's not going to disappoint - appreciate who they've turned into!",1281571200,2,1087,4.341584158415841
3988541,4,B002U6XQ94,"First off, I just got through watching/listening to the DVD again for the 7th time. I have spent a couple more extra viewings trying to hear what the Stapp bashing is all about. Folks, not sure what you hear, but what is coming out of my speakers is a guy singing aggressively and sounding in command of the audience. He has more than enough range and power to handle all the songs. He has fantastic presence on stage and as I said, has command of the audience. Noone seemed to notice the guest guitarist butchering the back vocals on (he was way late most of the time during ""What If""), or Tremonti's less than smooth playing of ""Higher"". Nitpicks could be thrown across the whole band if we all really wanted to. Me, I enjoyed the DVD thoroughly. The setlist is full of hits and album favorites a long with new songs off their latest. The quality of the production is fantastic, the sound, both in mix and clarity is also fantastic. I say to those who have a question as to whether or not to purchase this DVD, give it a rental if you are nervous by the Stapp bashing done on some of these reviews. As far as my personal opinion, it is a definite purchase for Creed fans, no question about it. In fact, I will be upgrading to Blu-ray.

From the first song I was bummed. Stapp's vocals are horrible. Not only does he sing off key but he is too dramatic in between songs. Obviously, vocal quality will suffer at a live show. But man...this disc gets unbearable. The visual quality is perfect. The audio is  a problem. The first disc purchased froze in various spots, then my replacement disc has audio cut outs on each and every song. Stapp does not sound good on the new songs and it's too bad.
The rest of the band is tight throughout. 17 songs on the disc is a bargain.

UNFORTUNATELY, I watched this dvd and during the first song I knew it was gonna be awful.  Stapp was just yelling with a completely flat voice and unable to hold any notes. He was just yelling/talking to a tune.  There was absolutely no range in his voice WHATSOEVER. I honestly  would have rather he just lip-synced.  His stage presence was great. The rest of the band was good, the production was great, lots of fireworks... but Stapp's voice was horrible.  I honestly couldn't appreciate any of the songs.  During ""with arms wide open"" he actually forgot some words and stumbled to recover the beginning of the second verse. Stapp's voice was nothing like it sounds in his albums.

I watched it with some friends and we all just kept looking at each other and being like ""what the f*""?

Stay away from this dvd and just listen to the greatest hits.",1268438400,,990,4.5423728813559325

The band plays fantastic, and their sound is impeccable, but if your singer is off/sucks, then your singer sucks!  It is too bad because the new Creed album, Full Circle, as well as their other stuff is great in studio.  I guess Stapp just can't do it live, which is really too bad.  I was disappointed in the DVD due to his lackluster performance.

This concert dvd is a total waste of my time and money! The sound is terrible and Scott Stapps voice is totally messed up! He sounds like some bad audition off of american idol! He sounds nothing like he does on the creed cd's plus he is sweating like a pig at meat market! What a waste of time and money! I ejected the dvd not even half way through the concert. The crowd at the show seems like they would rather be at a new kids on the block concert rather than set through the entire torture of this show. How sad. I am going to be selling my copy on ebay for a really really cheap price,Hell I might just pay someone to take this crapy dvd off of my hands!

First I'll start off with a positive.  The picture quality is great.  That's where anything positive ends.  The Dolby 3/2.1 mix sounds like it's going through a filter.  The DTS mix is clear and had so much potential, but the vocals are absolutely horrible.  As some other reviewers have stated, Scott Stapp's voice is awful and out of tune most of the time.

I guess since they set a new record of the most HD cameras filming the concert they felt compelled to release this DVD.  They probably should have done something with the vocals before releasing this.  Maybe they did, but if that's the case I doubt there would have been anyone left in the crowd because the vocals can't get much worse than this!

this is the worst creed live performance DVD ever recorded (mostly thanks to Stapp's lousy performance), and I really hope it is the last one in the row.

actually, the band performs fantastic, but it doesn't save Scott's awful vocals, totally f@cked up mixing and cheap video editing (239 hd-cameras - so where the h@ll they where?).

save your money for the next one - it should be better.

I have seen the reuion tour in Camden, New Jersey early in their touring schedule and they were incredable. However this dvd was shot later in their tour and Scott Stapp's voice was shot. He was out of tune and simply yelling the lyics, you could whithout a doubt tell his voice was strained and could not come close to replicating what you are used to hearing from him. Furthermore, the mixing of this concert was horrific! The mucic is barely audible, it is drowned out by Scott's out of tune screaming. I also have ""Alterbridge Live from Amsterdam"" to make a just comparison and that dvd is perfect. This is an extremely disappointing end product. I can't believe they would release this without doctoring it up. So, if you were lucky enough to see a good performance from their latest abbreviated tour, don't waste your money on this, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.",1262822400,,991,4.511111111111111

I went to see them live on this tour and they were absolutely amazing.  This DVD not only captures an unforgettable concert experience, but gives you a lot of ""behind the scenes"" footage of the bands reunion, tour, and life off the stage.

As for the music on the DVD, you can see from the track listing that they really did a brilliant job compiling a set list that included a bunch of songs from all of their albums!  They really played some of their most impressive stuff from My Own Prison, Human Clay, Weathered and also added in a few tracks from their newest album Full Circle! They played every song to absolute perfection and this DVD really displays the incredible talents of guitarist Mark Tremonti (one of the best guitarist ever), dummer Scott Phillips, bassist Brian Marshall, touring guitarist Eric Friedman and of course, lead vocalist Scott Stapp who is back and better than ever!

3988599,4,B002U6XQ94,"Let me start with the Cons first.

I don't know if anyone thought about this, but obviously when you read ""World Record"" , ""239 HD Cameras"" & ""Creed Live"" in one sentence, I don't know about you, but I'm thinking BLURAY!! Sadly, the Hype of the 200 plus HD Cameras used to film this concert IMO is a very misleading selling point, at least for the DVD. Mainly because it looks like any other Live concert, Sure its shot using HD Cameras, all extra crispy Picture.. But Isn't everything shot in HD Now ?!?! & just FYI, I saw this on a 60 inch HD flat screen so I know what I'm Talking about. I don't want it to sound like I'm Pissed off or anything, I'm just Blaming the misleading Product Marketing. Anyways, So I put in the DVD, and I'm on the Menu Screen, I see a ""Box Set Promo""
This is the real deal I suppose, since its A limited 3-disc deluxe edition and Its got the History of Creed Documentary, Backstage footage, Deleted Scenes, tour documentary, a T Shirt and they keep talking about ""Big Freeze Technology"" (I believe so, this is where the 239 HD Cameras were put to real use. or at least half of them) Oh Well, I doubt anyone was aware about this, because it clearly said ""out 2010"". Though I did notice a certain big freeze moment during the performance of their last song ""Higher"" But I'm assuming there will be more on the Deluxe Box Set Edition. Or probably a future Blu Ray Release.. If not, then well, No complaints, I'm a Creed fan, and I would have bought this even if it was available only on video ;o) I guess its only human nature, to sometimes overlook these things and just let them pass, because you know you love this band and will be happy just to see them live.. All the above is just to let the Buyer know and decide for himself if he wants to buy it..  or wait till another edition comes out. And last, There are some issues with the way the audio has been mixed on this DVD, I agree with a couple of other reviewers, and I'd like to add, at some high points in certain songs, I felt the audio level suddenly dropped, and then went high & all bassy.

As for pros... All Musicians were at their best, and their touring 5th member Eric Friedman gives the concert its much needed ambient nature.. for those who don't know, he had played guitar for the now disbanded, Submersed. The pyro & fire works were all amazing.. Great stage Set Up.. My only issue would be with Stapp's performance, probably because I was expecting to see the Stapp I knew from ""Human Clay""

Either ways, He does pull this one off well, just adding a little of his own Rockstar gimmics, totally unnecessary... and besides messing up the highs n lows on certain songs... he carried the show pretty well. My only personal suggestion to him at this point would be...  ""Grow ur hair again man ;o)""

In closing I'd like to say, that I'm not Creed bashing here, they are hands down, the better of, if not the best bands, from the post grunge era, my personal favorite too.

Its just that appearances nowadays are almost always deceiving, for the better or for worse is for you to decide, so do your homework before you spend your cash.

Scott has delivered GREAT past studio and live performances. Maybe it's just this tour, maybe it's his age. Maybe the band needs to start tuning down 1/2 step to make the vocal melodies more accesible to older vocals.  The instrumentation on this is very good but i hate to say i think Scott's vocal's limit what the band is able to do. Interesting enough, there is an additional guitarist on stage whose primary job seems to be to assist Scott in high harmonies and other vocal endevours-he does however, add rhythm guitar tracks and acoustic guitar, mandolin.
