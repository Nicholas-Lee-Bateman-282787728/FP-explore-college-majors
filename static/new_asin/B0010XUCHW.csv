8239282,4,B0010XUCHW,"I wanted to know more about the Cooperstown area, and this video seemed like it would be perfect for that.  The first 20 minutes or so is kind of boring but necessary since it covers Cooperstown history.  The rest of it covers what Cooperstown and the surrounding area has to offer.  I loved the video for that.

However, the production values were pretty bad.  The video has black bars on both the top and bottom, but even worse was the fact that the audio was way out of sync with the video.  Luckily, you don't see people talking that often, so it is not a problem for most of the video.  The whole production seems like it was made by a small town company.  I know Cooperstown is small, but since it is Cooperstown you would think that it would be better.

My only other complaint is that it seemed like they went too far out when talking about surrounding areas.  I believe they said that one of the attractions was an hour from Cooperstown.

All in all, I am glad I purchased this video.",1395532800,,993,4.313513513513514
8239283,1,B0010XUCHW,"Opening info about James Fennimore Cooper made this look like a promising travel overview, but then it was all downhill. Technically this looks like an elementary school project with dead audio space and repeated visual images. Some local businesses must have fronted funds for the production as their services have a more prominent focus. Finally, if you are looking for a good overview of baseball in this ""Home of Baseball"" video you are better off reading an encyclopedia article.",1335052800,2,484,5.139240506329114
