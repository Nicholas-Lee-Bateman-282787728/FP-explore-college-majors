2141310,5,B0002Y4TOM,"The first season of this wonderfully rich and vibrant show on The WB was a fine and solid debut. It set things in place that the show will take higher and with even better results. Such is season two for an example. With the addition of a new character, the junior year scored. Opening with ""Sadie, Sadie"" and ""Hammers And Veils"", the two part opener resolves the Lorelei/Max cliffhanger from season one. This was originally aired as a two hour premiere. A great opener. Rory's future educational life and Lorelei's empty nest syndrome is given a foreshadowing in ""The Road Trip To Harvard"". Luke's nephew, the broody and troublesome Jess, debuts in ""Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy"", after he is sent to live with Luke. He doesn't like anyone...except Rory. He causes some minor mayhem in the delightful ""The Inns And Outs Of Inns"", before turning the town on it's ear when Rory gets hurt in ""Teach Me Tonight"". An ongoing story arc here also concerns Richard and Emily(Edward Herrmann, Kelly Bishop), when Richard goes through a career crisis that we first really learn about in ""Presenting Lorelei Gilmore"", and is further expanded on in ""Help Wanted"", and ""Back In The Saddle Again"". One of the best episodes here is the wintery delight of ""The Bracebridge Dinner"", where Lorelei and Sookie invite friends and family to the inn. ""Lost And Found"" is another highlight, as the season ends with a wedding and a broken heart in ""I Can't Get Started"". There are many more good things here, but too many to write. Like any TV show, every season is filled with some duds. The duds here are ""Red Light On The Wedding Night"", ""There's The Rub"", which has Lorelei and Emily going to a spa for a weekend, and ""Secrets And Loans"", among a few others. The show continues to be one of the most incredibly brilliant and sharpest shows on TV. The dialogue and banter continue to be second to none, and continues to make people wonder where the closet full of Emmy's this show should have won by now are at. The cast is one of the finest ensembles on TV. Lauren Graham continues to be one of the best leading ladies on TV. Her Lorelei is fleshed out and she carries the show with a magnetic presence that cannot be denied. She is a vision of beauty, and an actress of high caliber talent. The same can be said for Alexis Bledel, who continues to be one of the best representations of a young woman on TV. Same goes for Kelly Bishop, who is a fine and elegant actress in her portrayal. Much praise to the rest of the cast and the town's oddball collection of quirky citizens, which includes the likes of Luke, Lane, Miss Patty, Kirk, Taylor, Babbette, and Paris. A fine collection of supporting characters. The show continues to show a truly strong and healthy relationship between mother and daughter, and the nature of their relationship is a lot more common than some people think. Lorelei has proven herself to be a great mother and the proof is in all the good she has done for Rory, and what she has done herself and their lives and done so mostly on her own. Take a trip to Stars Hollow soon. You won't soon regret it.",1093737600,26,3103,4.532976827094474

2141466,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Amy Sherman Palladino is a true genius. My best friend introduced me to Gilmore Girls Freshman year of college and I was hooked. Lorelai is the epitome of a cool mum, but without the irresponsibility. She's her daughter's best friend but also remembers to take on the authority role when necessary. Rory is sweet, smart, relatable and has the most angelic face. Lane is the perfect complement to Rory. Sookie is hilarious. Luke is the best. The dialogue is just amazing - so witty, so fast-paced, and peppered with pop culture and literary references. This is my kind of show!",1464307200,,576,4.77

2141480,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Ah Gilmore Girls... I cannot say enough good things about this show. This show follows the lives of small town girls (and mother and daughter) Lorelei and Rory Gilmore who live in the town of Stars Hollow. The two have the type of relationship a mother can only dream of. They share laughs, tears, heartache, the whole nine years. This show will have you laughing, crying, frustrated, and a whole mess of emotions I can only begin to describe. You become invested in the characters and their stories. You'll find yourself sitting at your desk at home wondering what the Gilmore Girls are up to, forgetting that they are merely television characters. Also did you hear the rumors that years after the show ending, the Gilmore Girls may soon be making another appearance, but now in a movie? I CANNOT WAIT.

I'd say jump right into Stars Hallow and fall in love with the show just like I did. If you go on a crazy Gilmore Girls binge and happen to find yourself done with the series in a weeks time, have no fear, the girls will be coming back soon.",1447718400,4,1047,4.481675392670157

The dialogue and chemistry between Lorelei and Rory is great. You really get the feeling they are mother and daughter. I also really enjoy their interactions with Emily and Richard. You can really feel the emotional turmoil between Lore and Emily. Now add into the mix the supporting characters from the small town they live in and it is an AMZING show. I love Luke, Sookie, Patty, Kurt, and even Taylor at times. I also love that this is a family show your entire family can enjoy.

2141648,5,B0002Y4TOM,"My daughter and I watched all 7 seasons of the Gilmore Girls during her teenage years and loved it! Not only was it another way for us to bond, but it covered so many of the challenges that teenagers go through, from friends, to boyfriends, to preparing for and choosing a college. By the time my daughter was applying to colleges, we knew what to expect (and we were looking for that large envelope in the mail, which we got, and unfortunately which they no longer doit's all my email now). It's a great, wholesome series that I highly recommend every mom watch with her daughters. It offers plenty of opportunities for discussion of situations they may encounter in their own lives.  My daughter even puts it on when she comes home for college breaks because it's very comforting to watch.",1393718400,,791,4.609929078014185
2141649,3,B0002Y4TOM,"I am not the target audience for this show because I am a man but it is fairly well done and there are aspects of it that I like.  The main protagonists are a single mother named Lorelai Gilmore and her 16 year old daughter Rory.  The show chronicles their lives in a small town called Star's Hollow that is full of strange and off-beat characters.  It also deals with their relationship with Lorelai's parents and with some of Rory's classmates and friends at school.

Loerlai is portrayed by Loren Graham and she is a complex character.  Lorelai is a relatively young (32) and very attractive single mom who is best friends with her daughter.  She is very much a snarky smart-ass and at times can be very funny.  She is the manager of a local inn and several of the supporting cast members are her employees.  She and Rory are well know and well liked in the town.  But as a man watching the show I had a hard time rooting for Lorelai as a protagonist because she has a very deep character flaw.  She treats all of the men in her life like crap.  It's not that she does not like men.  She likes having them around as long as they are doing things for her and not being in any way inconvenient, but she has no real respect for them and she often treats them very badly.  And with her it is completely a one-way street.  When she treats a man badly she expects him to completely understand her needs and emotions but she feels no obligation to understand, or in some cases even acknowledge, his needs and emotions.  I am giving the show's writers the benefit of the doubt here, by assuming that this character is meant to be seen as flawed in this way, rather than meant to be seen as a ""strong woman"".  Even though it was difficult for me to root for Lorelai, I do acknowledge that the show's writers wrote her very consistently and Loren Graham portrayed her consistently true to the way the character was written.

I had no such trouble rooting for Lorelai's daughter Rory, portrayed very well by Alexis Bledel.  Despite her mother's poor example, Rory cares very deeply about the needs and emotions of all of her friends and family members, regardless of their sex.  In fact, she agonizes over her boyfriend's feelings.  And she even cares to some degree about the hurt feelings her worst enemies!  If anything this girl is too nice and too empathetic.  Your heart just goes out to her and you can't help but root for her to succeed and find happiness, or at least that was my reaction to her.  It is for this reason that I am willing to give the show's writers the benefit of the doubt on the Lorelai character, because with Rory they clearly demonstrate that they can write an intelligent female who does not treat the males in her life badly.

The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  There are those that I despise and think the show would be better off without.  (Babette, Taylor, Sookie, & Jackson).  And those that I think are good and contribute well to the show (Luke, Lane, Michel, Paris, Dean, Tristan, Madeline, Louise, Miss Patty, Kirk, & Rachel).  And those that are themselves a mixed bag and bring both good and bad things to the show (Jess, Lorelai's parents, Christopher, & Max).  Michel, Lane, and Paris, portrayed respectively by Yanic Truesdale, Keiko Agena, and Liza Weil are particularly good and, each in their own way, very unique characters.

Overall I thought this was a fairly well done chic show.  I can't give it 4 stars because there were just too many things about it that I did not like but I would give it 3.5 stars if I could because there are some characters in the show that I did like quite a bit.",1393545600,,3635,4.437405731523379
2141650,5,B0002Y4TOM,"We have watched all the episodes up to season 5 so far, and they are all good. This show probably has to be seen more than once to catch all of the clever lines the writers have put in there. You find yourself missing some great one-liners because you were still laughing at a previous one-liner. If you like season one you will like them all, the show just keeps getting better.",1393545600,,379,4.277777777777778

The mother/daughter relationship is a beautiful one.  I'm sure all mothers wish they could handle their daughter like she handles Rory.  The problems they deal with are very real, but can be quite troublesome as well.  Not everything ends well, but they will bounce back.  I'm thinking the story is quite predictable, but maybe not.

2141731,3,B0002Y4TOM,"Wife loves the series and I find myself enjoying them, as well. A valuable lesson I learned in comparing these first two seasons is that the show is best as a warm, comfortable cup of hot cocoa ... with a dash of screwball comedy. This second season starts to lean more on the drama, which I find to be not one of the show's best attributes and, thus, this season is not as much of a favorite. However, since the earliest parts of the show are easily the best, I'd rate this as third place, still, behind one and three. Rory visits the Harvard campus and finds the new mysterious boy to be a little interesting, her grandfather feels he's being phased out of his career, Lane falls in love with the drums, Lorelai graduates from business school and gets mixed up over men, and throughout all of this are preparations for Sookie and Jackson's big day. Some fun moments include Bid-a-Basket, Lorelai and Emily's spa trip, and the Bracebridge dinner.",1358208000,,947,4.543859649122807

The show is really well-written in my opinion, and I think this season keeps all the awesomeness of the first season. Lots of pop culture references that are nicely placed in the quick wit and conversation. And, for your convenience, this DVD boxset of season 2 has an insert called ""Gilmore-isms"" which lists all the pop culture references within the show (not sure if a complete list, but had all the ones I didn't recognize and looked up in this booklet insert). All in all, very satisfied with this DVD boxset of Season 2 of the Gilmore Girls.",1341014400,,637,4.452991452991453

2141775,5,B0002Y4TOM,"After becoming addictive to watching reruns on ABC Family and Soap.net, I stumbled upon the Gilmore Girls season one and two bundled together for under twenty dollars at a Target Store. After quickly going through the first season, a few days later I started watching the second season. A week went by and I had finished watching it. I realized that the series was aimed for a female audience, but for some reason it clicked with me, mostly because I caught Lorelai and Rory constantly drinking coffee, and I have always liked Lauren Graham ever since I saw her in Bad Santa.

Season 2 picks up where the first season finale ended, with Lorelai finally saying ""yes"" to Max's marriage proposal and Rory starts up her relationship with Dean again. I found it odd that the first few episodes are set during the summer, as in most TV series the start of season takes place three months later, where the kids are going back to school. The first three episodes involve planning for the upcoming wedding, which never really happens as Lorelai calls it off. The following episode has Rory and her on a road trip to visit Harvard; well it was more like crashing and is my favorite episode now. Lorelai's love life is ignored through most of the season besides from a few scenes with Rory's father who ends up going nowhere. Rory's love life is the man focus as she is torn between her sweetheart Dean and Luke's troubled nephew Jess.

Between the smart dialogue, quirky characters, and the coffee drinking, I absolutely love this show, and I regret never watching it during its original run. Luke (the owner of Luke's Diner) is the most relatable character for me. From his casual style, ruddiness/crankiness, and attitude, all in which reminds me of myself, except for his dislike of coffee. Or course I like Lorelai for her smart-ass attitude and Rory's love of books. What I didn't care for was the character Jess, who is just an annoying troublemaker. I was laughing out loud when Luke shoved Jess into the lake.",1337731200,2,2007,4.682719546742209

2141781,5,B0002Y4TOM,"From the time I viewed the first episode of Gilmore Girls, I was hooked, and the attachment to this beloved show has only grown from strength to strength [yes, even till the less than satisfying final season 7].

Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval. And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.

There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. All of which, coupled with rapidfire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show make Gilmore Girls a rare gem amongst TV series - great casting, excellent scripts and beautiful, scenic sets. A must-watch indeed!",1320019200,,1489,5.148760330578512

2141783,4,B0002Y4TOM,"This is really just a review about Gilmore Girls Season 2, because the product is just a bunch of DVDs displaying some of the best moments of the series. But, uh, they're great DVDs too, no doubt. But seriously, Season 2? It's filled with all of those amazing Rory/ Jess moments, and with the exception of a few episodes in the beginning of Season 3, these are really the only happy moments we get. So get this season and enjoy while it lasts, because the farther along we go the more Dean comes back... The only downside to these DVDs that makes me give it 4/5 stars is the fact that the bonus material is not so great. It includes maybe 2 unaired scenes, one fact-pop-up episode, a short segment on how other countries received Gilmore Girls, and a short collage of the seasons best shouting matches. Personally, I'm more of an ""interview with the cast"" or ""backstage"" kind of girl, but if these bonus materials excite you, hit purchase because this is a great price for a great season!",1312156800,,988,4.4944444444444445

What a pleasant surprise, to the point I can listen/ watch it over and over and still find things to discuss after I get thru the initial funny lines and fast talk.  It is smart, different and touches on so many levels of family  and friend dynamics .

At first it appears this is a story about a young girl growing up with a single mom, but you soon learn it is about the relationships of her mother, grandmother and all the slightly off kilter world of Stars Hollow.

The snappy dialogue and quirky characters continue to amuse and surprise as we watch Lorelai and Chris almost get back together.  Rory becomes more of a friend to Paris but less of a girlfriend to poor Dean in favor of tough guy Jess, Sookie and Jackson finally hook up, Luke remains Lor's best pal, and Taylor Doose still drives everybody crazy while Kirk is...well, oddball Kirk.  And then there's that minstrel.  And Rory's funny friend Lane, whom I feel sorry for because of her too-strict mother.

2141854,3,B0002Y4TOM,"The first season of Gilmore Girls promised to be one of the best sitcoms since The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The dialog was witty and consistently good. The characters were quirky, but real. Each of the characters is a flawed, but decent human being (except for Rory who is the perfect young teenager, a serious flaw in reality). The story unfolds showing the strengths and weaknesses of each character in a series of warm, amusing episodes.

The quality of the series, however, descended dramatically in Season Two and essentially became a soap opera with dark overtones. Lorelai's mother changes from a manipulative but caring mother who is concerned for the welfare of her grandchild (from her cloistered perspective) to an extremely, self-centered woman whose primary concern is her control over her granddaughter and in the process sabotages her granddaughter's inheritance. Our hero, Lorelai, also develops an unusually cruel streak. She is so thrilled with her mother's discomfort with her mother-in-law (her mother's mother-in-law) that she brings a camera to photograph the event. A key episode is the one in which Lorelai breaks off her engagement at the last minute without the decency to explain why to her fiance, but rather lets the town gossip break the news to all and sundry. Are men simply objects without feelings in women's soap operas, whose sole purpose is to adore the heroine and disappear when not needed? Escapism is one thing, but escapism that breeds gross insensitivity to others is not something to expect of the heroes with whom we identify.

In the first season, when Lorelei was a decent person despite her flaws, her father lectured her on the pain she had caused others by having a child out of wedlock. Lorelai, however, values her independence so much that she opts out of marriage with the father of her child although she loves him (in her self-centered sort of way) and sleeps with him in a later episode. It is interesting to note that of the many characters in the story there is no happily married couple with children. Is this because it might expose the fans of the Gilmore Girls to the happiness that Lorelai and Rory might have experienced growing up with a decent father figure (believe it or not, a key component of the majority of families). It is also interesting to note that in the first season, Rory's boyfriend breaks up with her because of her lack of spontaneous warmth to his declaration of love and she is then bereft and much saddened until they make up several episodes later. Episodes such as these have the element of truth in them. In contrast, in the second season, she puts off a date with her boyfriend because she is busy and promises to meet with him that evening. She later fluffs him off for a very self-centered reason. This time, however, reality gives way to escapism and the boyfriend crawls back with an apology. It doesn't happen that way in reality, at least with young men having some backbone. I gave the soap opera a rating of three stars, this being the average of five stars for the first season and one star for the second season.

The sad part of all of this is that Rory and Lorelai have a huge fan base. There are thousands of young women who identify with our two self-centered heroes regardless of their insensitivity (if not downright cruelty) to others and their lack of responsibility regarding their actions. Witty banter does make up for irresponsible behavior.",1243036800,3,3452,4.808080808080808

That being said, I have no problem with the show itself in this season.

However, the discs have a tendency to pause for a second or two at least three times during each episode.  I find this to be irritating, but not bad enough to return the product.

Much of the angst comes with the introduction of a new character, Luke's nephew Jess (Milo Ventimiglia).  He sets his sights on Rory early on, and his bad boy vibe coupled with his appreciation of fine literature catches her attention as well, which does not bode well for her relationship with Dean (Jared Padalecki).  Lorelai's love life remains as complicated as ever, as does her relationships with her parents.

2141902,5,B0002Y4TOM,"From the time I viewed the first episode of Gilmore Girls, I was hooked, and the attachment to this beloved show has only grown from strength to strength [yes, even till the less than satisfying final season 7].

Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval. And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.

There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. All of which, coupled with rapidfire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show make Gilmore Girls a rare gem amongst TV series - great casting, excellent scripts and beautiful, scenic sets. A must-watch indeed!",1196208000,,1489,5.148760330578512

2141929,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Having literally grown up together, 17-year-old Rory Gilmore and her 33-year-old mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.

In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.

Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.

Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.

In this season, Rory continues dating Dean, her first serious boyfriend, while fighting an attraction to Luke's bad-boy nephew Jess. Lorelai becomes engaged to Max, a teacher at Chilton. Emily wants Rory to participate in a debutante ball, and Lorelai and Sookie want to realize their dream of opening their own inn.

Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)",1175299200,,2471,5.15211970074813
2141930,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I wasn't one who watched Gilmore Girls when it started airing on TV. I didn't even KNOW about the show. I was told about the show by a friend of mine, and she told me I had to check it out. Well, I was over at her house one night and watched one episode in the 5th season DVD set, and I was hooked!  I bought the first season DVD set to try it, and I wound up loving every single episode! I was so sad to know I had watched them all so far, so I ordered the second DVD set.  I've watched half of the episodes so far, and I must say it's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. It's a wholesome show about a mother and daughter that might live in a ""utopia-type town"", but they deal with real issues. My favorite thing about the show is all of the literary references they throw in. I believe they're called ""Gilmorisms"".  They're hilarious...AND it keeps you constantly interested in what they're going to say next! (Where did THAT come from?? What literary writer was that??) I suggest that any mother or teenage daughter needs to see this show.  Of course, I'm 29 and I love it too! :)",1173312000,,1088,4.093896713615023

2141953,5,B0002Y4TOM,I love the Gilmore Girl series! I own Season 1 and am slowly but surely starting to collect them all! I just started to collect all of my favorite TV shows that I couldn't completely follow. Gilmore Girls is a great starter! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SERIES TO WOMEN/MEN WHO LOVE A GOOD LAUGH AND THE OCCASIONAL DRAMA!,1171929600,,315,4.448275862068965
2141954,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Okay, techinically this is ""second season"", but in reality, this is the first TRUE season. First season is cute and all, but it's only prepping us for the heart, humor, and brilliance of those amazing Gilmore Girls. First season was the warm up, and here's the marathon. The incredible second season. First season got us prepared. It got us hooked on the show. Now we've got this spectacular season sitting before us. If you want to start watching, start watching here. Nothing of true meaning happens in first season. This is where all the good stuff happens.

Second season starts with something that obviously has to end. Obviously, the main ""single mom"" character of a show can't get married a week into its second season! Don't fool yourselves, though. This season is big on love, crushes, and heartbreaks, if that's what you're looking for. And even if it's not, you'll still find it and plenty more.

One of the monumental things about second season is how things start to change. The moment the concept of marriage is out, a new character enters the show. And boy, does he enter. Whether you like Jess or not, you can't deny that he is a fascinating character in that he really spices things up. Jess, Luke's nephew. It doesn't matter that a lot of people don't like him (foolishly, if you ask me, as he's my favorite boy-character throughout the entire show... none can replace him), or that nobody wanted things to change, he's here, and he's good. Jess marks the beginning of change in the show. He's the cause of pain, anger, love, and guilt. With his arrival come the problems that center around jealousy, crushes, friendships, and in general, relationships.

So besides our new character, we've also got a whole new set of issues. Lorelai decided not to get married... so where do we go? We see her in what we have to suppose is her typical, love-less world. She's just as funny, just as witty, and just as exciting as ever. Lorelai is still our fun-loving, quick-tongued, amazing woman, and just because she doesn't have a boyfriend doesn't mean she's not interesting. We get more of her relationships with her parents in this season, too. We see Lorelai alone with her father, and alone with her mother. Lorelai deals with a lot this season, and ends it with something that seems too much like a broken heart.

Rory, too. Our little heroine is growing up, but she's still the book-reading, obsessive studier she ever was. In this season things also change for her. The arrival of Jess causes her lots of issues with her boyfriend Dean, and these issues are not so easily resolved. More often than not, Rory and Dean are in an uncomfortable spot because of Jess. This season also shows that they rarely talk, and that their relationship is a bit strained. Besides Rory's awkward love-life, we get a sense of her other relationships too. Rory and her best friend Lane even have some issues, but those are easily resolved. Rory is even forced to try to make friends by a concerned school. Ultimately, Rory ends the year in just as much romantic turmoil as her mother, but this time she's gained a friend instead of making an enemy. Paris, with whom Rory has a ""friends-ish"" relationship, becomes more and more main throughout this season. Rory's suddenly got friends, boys fawning over her, and more drama than ever before.

As was hinted last season, ""Gilmore Girls"" is about relationships and life. It's not just about love, and it's not just about drama. It's about the connections people make. We see the times that Lorelai and Luke are yelling at each other, both hurt more than the other can imagine. We see Rory and Lorelai fighting about the truth about the night that Rory's arm broke (watch this to find out HOW!). We watch as Lorelai fights both mother and father. We watch as Rory tries to stand up for herself, and realizes that she's doing fine. We see all of our beloved characters dealing with life in a funny and wonderful way.

If you haven't seen first season and you want to watch the show, let me put it this way. My first episodes were from this season. It's fantastic. Even after having seen all of the show up until now, I can say that I absolutely love this season. Whether it's because of Jess, because of Rory, because of Lorelai, or because of the incredible Disc 4, I can't say. All I can say is that this is a must buy, and that anybody who can appreciate witty comments and quick humor will love this show. If you liked first season, then you'll LOVE second. If you're just starting, you can start here! It's a superb season. You can't help but fall in love with all of the characters and with everything.

The special features are pretty cool too, and where else will you be able to watch this incredible season of this amazing show? Buy it now! You won't be disappointed in the least.",1171411200,3,4830,4.6158323632130385
2141955,4,B0002Y4TOM,"Gilmore Girls returns, this time with a more seasoned cast, and the addition of a few more characters such as: ""Jess,"" Luke's delinquent uncle and more appearences from Cristopher, Lorelai's ex.

I particularly liked the relationship between Dean and Rory, and I was pleasantly suprised to see the eldest Lorelai a trifle less of a motormouth this season. As usual, the Gilmore's parents, the French concierge, Luke and some of the other townsfolk were excellent.

I admit I'm not a huge fan of Christopher (Lorelai's ex), and I just don't see any chemistry between him and Lorelai. I also don't like the character of Jess as I find him rather irritating. He does stir things up, however.

Characters keep growing and developing, coming together in unexpected combinations and going to places they came nowhere near in the first series (Paris in Stars Hollow, for instance). Things get a little rocky at times, relationships are tested. Plus, there's a lot more of the awkward all-rounder Kirk (who's probably my favorite character). He even makes a short film in this series, which appears as a special feature, along with deleted scenes and a couple of other goodies.

2141974,5,B0002Y4TOM,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,7,1946,4.807807807807808

2142011,5,B0002Y4TOM,"One of the inside jokes in SEINFELD was that it was a series in which nothing happened, but in comparison to THE GILMORE GIRLS, SEINFELD can seem like an action series.  Things do happen in THE GILMORE GIRLS, but for the most part what happens is the characters talk.  And it isn't for the most part filled with pathos or venom or invective.  Even when characters are in conflict, it is intelligent, witty, restrained talk.  And even when characters are being mean to one another, the focus on the talk is not the way another character is cut down to size (something that rarely occurs on the show), but in the smartness and the intelligence of the talk.  If SEINFELD (and Larry David's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) is the premiere show for exploring the neuroses of human beings living in society with one another, THE GILMORE GIRLS is the series that most explores the joys to be found in people talking to one another.

Season Two features some plot developments, but the events in the show are always tame compared with other shows.  Ironically, the rapidity of the talk and the energy in the dialogue always leaves me with the impression of each episode as being filled with a lot of content, though upon reflection the plots can be incredibly simple.  For instance, in the episode ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket,"" Dean and Jess have a fight because Jess outbids Dean for Rory's lunch basket (and the right to eat it with her).  Really, that is just about all that happens on the episode.  The action on nearly every episode is just slightly above the action in MY DINNER WITH ANDRE (hey, cultural references abound in the show, so why can't they in a review?).  The plot highlights of the year include such big events as Lorelai breaking off her engagement to Max, Lorelai discovering that her house has termites, Rory almost getting inducted into a secret society after the principal encourages her to get more involved in the social life of the school, Lane arranging to play on the drums a couple of days each week in the new music store, Sookie and Jackson get married, Lorelai and Chris almost get back together, and so on and so forth.  Now, the same kinds of things happen in soap operas, but there is nothing at all sudsy about THE GILMORE GIRLS.  There is zero pathos, and if given the opportunity to milk the viewer's emotions, the temptation is always resisted.  I read an interview with Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator and creative force, in which she says that she was wanting to emulate the conversation that one can find in such thirties films as THE THIN MAN, in which Nick and Nora Charles (homage is even made to the pair in the title of the episode ""Nick and Nora/Sid and Nancy"") would casually knock about enormously witty, but somewhat detached, banter.

The other thing that is notable in the show is the lack of anything seedy or scandalous in the town or the show, which is amazing given the fact that Lorelai's being a mother was the result of having gotten pregnant at age 16.  Jess is a bit of a juvenile delinquent, but most of the controversy in the town is generated by Taylor's endless crusades against one absurdly innocuous thing or another.  In one episode Paris decides to rip open the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow, but the results are exceedingly meager.  All in all, the show contains less angst, less trauma, less conflict, and less drama than any other show on TV.  There is a lot of crankiness-Lorelai's mother being upset at one thing or another, Luke griping about one thing or another, or Lane's mother complaining about one thing or another-but little actual grief.  Even one of the big events of the season, Rory's breaking her arm in a car accident, is treated in a surprisingly subdued manner.

Yet, the show really is brilliant.  Why?  First, the talk and conversation really is that good.  Second, the entire cast of characters form a marvelous ensemble cast.  If the writing was so consistently brilliant, and if the actors weren't so excellent at embracing their characters, the show would be awful.  As it is, it is one of the most entertaining shows currently on TV.",1123113600,4,4121,4.673130193905817
2142012,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Gilmore Girls Season 2 skipped the almost unavoidable sophomore slump and produced a strong and engaging second season. In its first airing the ratings increased substantially not to mention that the show was constantly kicking Buffy's butt in the ratings. Some of  my favorite storylines in the show are those involving the relationship of Lorelei and Emily, and this season provided lots of great Lorelei-Emily moments. Kelly Bishop was just perfect for the part.

Some of the best episodes of second season are:

-Sadie, Sadie and Hemmers and Veils (Season 2 premiere)

-The Road Trip to Harvard (Graham was quietly moving anticipating the inevitable college years of Rory)

-Like Mother, Like Daughter (Emily and Lorelie in a matching outfit!!!)

-The Bracebridge Dinner

-Secrets and Loans

-A-Tisket A-Tasket (the Dean-Jess-Rory triangle took the centerstage)

-There's the Rub (A great Lorelei-Emily episode)

-Lorelei's Graduation Day (It was heartbreaking when Emily and Richard were visibly  moved by Lorelei's graduation)

-I Can't Get Started (finale)

2142014,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...

Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...

The Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Sadie, Sadie"" in which Lorelai accepts Max's marriage proposal and tells everyone except her parents the good news. In the meantime, Rory brings Dean to her grandparent's house to celebrate Rory's academic success at Chilton, only to have Richard castigate Dean for his lack of ambition. Meanwhile, Emily is heartbroken when she learns of her daughter's wedding from Sookie instead of Lorelai... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Ins and Outs of Inns"" in which Lorelai and Sookie decide to follow their dream to buy and run an inn (but encounter complications in finding the right property), and ""There's the Rub"" in which Emily and Lorelai bond while taking a weekend spa...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD:

Episode 22 (Sadie, Sadie)

Episode 23 (Hammers and Veils)

The same witty banter, pop culture references, conflicting circumtances between the characters. nothing can beat the tandem of mother and daughter. as the season progress so does the characters but the same dynamic and i cant get enough of them.",1118016000,4,265,5.045454545454546
2142016,2,B0002Y4TOM,"Well, I am a 38 French guy, just for you to know. I had been charmed by season 1. But season 2 gets old pretty fast I think. Overall nothing much happens in season 2. It is mostly a lot of talking to fill out the gaps. The last episode is more exciting to watch but it is no surprise as they just want you to buy season 3 so they make you want more at the end of the last episode. they should have done that with each episode in the season, which they didn't. I was disappointed in not being addicted to it as I had been with THE O.C or ONE TREE HILL.

The other problem I have with this show is the unrealistic way the characters express themselves, you know you can tell someone wrote  every single thing they say. I found it original in season 1 and got tired of it. Buy ONE TREE HILL instead if you haven't done already.",1117929600,5,824,3.9578313253012047

They're there for each other through tough times, and they tell each other everything.  Christopher came back often to spend time with Rory (which was special.)  Then there's Luke and Kirk, who can be pretty funny sometimes.  Jess acts like an idiot who doesn't do much, but he's so gentle and nice around Rory.  Dean and Rory are a good couple, too.  My favorite episodes are The Road Trip To Harvard, Presenting Lorelai Gilmore, The Inns & Outs Of Inns, Run Away, Little Boy, Lorelai's Graduation Day, and I Can't Get Started.

2142033,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I got hooked on Gilmore Girls around season three, if I recall, so naturally bought both seasons 1 and 2 on DVD in order to catch up. This show couldn't be more perfect.  The cast is tremendous and they all work together with machine-like precision.  Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop (daughter and mother) are particularly noteworthy because it seems there are many mothers and daughters who have this sort of love-hate relationship, filled with issues that never quite get resolved over the course of years.  Bishop as the rich, pretentiously formal mother is so convincing that I'd probably be visibly shaken were I to see her in jeans in a coffee shop eating bacon and eggs. And Lauren Graham?  What's not to like?  She has given life to one of the truly unique characters in TV history as the daughter who just won't buy into her parents' lifestyle and controlling ways.  She delivers her lines with such rapid-fire perfection that one wonders how she can ever ""come down"" from playing this role for over 100 episodes at this point. (Her character is always drinking strong coffee, which, if it's the real thing, may help explain a few things.) And those cross-references! Strange, exotic trivia comes out of the mouths of some of the characters as fluidly as if they were simply saying, ""Have a nice day.""  That adds an element of fun to the show, in my opinion.  Having just aired their 100th episode in early February 2005, some wonder how long this show can sustain itself.  In my opinion, the creators are smart enough to know when it's time to say goodbye, but, meanwhile, a ""weak"" Gilmore Girls episode towers above most of the predictable junk on most TV channels.",1108425600,3,1674,4.725085910652921
2142034,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Yeah, I signed up when I bought Season One, and reaffirmed my commitments and membership to The Gilmore Girls Craze when I bought season 2...

So, where did we leave off?  Rory finally told Dean that she loves him (I love you, you idiot... funny), and Lorelai had just gotten proposed to through 1,000 yellow lillies, or whatever the flower was...  It looks like a year of love for the Gilmore girls...  But that would be boring...

Returning this season are:  Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore), Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore), Scott Patterson (Luke Danes), Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Jared Padalecki (Dean), Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Edward Hermann (Richard Gilmore), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie St. James) and, Yanic Truesdale as Michel...  And let's welcome newcomer Milo Ventimiglia as the new bad boy nephew of Luke from New York, Jess...

Upon watching the first season, I didn't honestly believe that any season could trump it.  The dialogue in this wonderful drama is absolutely magnificent, and delivered perfectly by its incredible cast.  We are rarely left with any dull moments, because as things begin to get happier, something else happens to bring the crew down...  Here's what we get to look forward to:

1.  Rory's relationship with Dean...  It seemed like it would be a match made in heaven after Rory declared her love for Dean, until Jess came into town.  While Dean is caring, compassionate, considerate, and a little annoying at times, Jess seems like a breath of fresh air, as despite his attitudinal deficiencies, they seem to be more on the same plane...  The more important question is, will Rory and Dean be able to keep their flamed akindled, or will Jess steal her heart away...

2.  Lorelai...  Upon a self-revelation, she decides to break of the wedding with Max Medina last minute, as the girls take an impulsive trip to Harvard.  Boy trauma for Lorelai seems to keep to the down low, until Christopher booms in with news of a new girlfriend...  They seem serious too...  Then again, you never can tell, and on the heels of something magical blooming between Christopher and Lorelai, yet more obstacles get in the way...

3.  Richard and Emily.  We all knew that they fought quite a bit, after all, old people set in their ways, not to mention being kind of one-sided, including their absolute adoration of their granddaughter.  But Richard is a little on edge, as things occur between them that may cause problems later on...

Let's not also forget to mention Luke's relationship with Jess, which makes for great fun a lot of times, Rory's ascent to her change in character, Sookie & Jackson, adventures in modeling, a huge village sized dinner party complete with horses and boyfriend controversy, newspaper extravaganzas, a luxurious spa visit, Richard in Stars Hollow, and talk of Lorelai and Sookies starting their own inn...

This season is full of humor, joy, and tragedy.  It has its plethora of sad moments, and happy moments, and altogether times where you might feel tears beginning to shed from your eyes, not mention yet another cliffhanger ending as we dont' really know what to feel, or what will happen.

IMO you can't go wrong with this show, the dialogue alone is enough to keep you watching.

2142059,5,B0002Y4TOM,"The second season of ""Gilmore Girls"" is when a lot of things did not happen to Lorelai Gilmore.  It started with Lorelai not marrying Max (""Red Light on the Wedding Night"") and ended with her not marrying Christopher (""I Can't Get Started""), but Sookie got married so at least there was some progress in that area, although the duo's plan to open an inn together hits a major roadblock (""The Ins and Outs of Inns"").  Of course, the most important thing that did not happen to Lorelai was that she manages to really notice Luke despite the fact he is pretty much there in front of her every morning at the diner.  Clearly the creators of ""Gilmore Girls"" remember what happened to ""Moonlighting"" once Dave and Maddie stopped bantering and started kissing and other things, so the agenda is to put off the inevitable for as long as possible.  So even if it is obvious to everyone else in Stars Hollow (to wit, Emily), does not mean that Lorelai has a clue.

As for Rory, her junior year at Chilton has its ups and downs. and not just because of Paris.  The ups would be ""The Road Trip to Harvard"" and making her society debut (""Presenting Lorelai Gilmore""), while the downside would be the rift between her and her grandfather because of Dean (""Sadie, Sadie"") and the problems with Dean because of Jess (""There's the Rub"" and ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"").  If anything, the common denominator is to make sure that none of the Gilmore women are happy, which means Rory is mad at Lorelai for blaming Jess for the accident (""Help Wanted,"" Lorelai is mad at Emily for arranging their going to a spa together (""There's the Rub"") and Emily is mad at Richard for quitting his job without consulting here (""The Bracebridge Dinner"").  What?  You thought Emily was going to be mad at Rory?  Are you kidding?  Have you not been watching this show?

For me the fascinating part is watching the yang of Lorelai and Emily's relationship compared to the yin of the Lorelai and Rory dynamic.  For me some of the most memorable moments from season two are when Emily orders Richard to make up with Rory because if their granddaughter ever gets married she to know about it (Lorelai did not tell her parents about her engagement to Max) and the look on her parent's face with Lorelai gets her business school diploma (""Lorelai's Graduation Day"").  But then a good rule of thumb is anytime we see a chink in Emily's armor it is a moment that will be hard to forget.  I am still trying to make up my mind as to whether or not Lorelai has an even more strained relationship with her father than her mother, given his visit to her place of work (""Richard in Stars Hollow"") and her visit to his new office (""Help Wanted"").  I am certainly leaning in that direction, but it is still open to debate.

But overall the two emotional highpoints of the second season finding Lorelai giving and then receiving as good as she gets.  The giving happens in ""Teach Me Tonight"" when a totally distraught Lorelai goes after Luke because of the car accident where Rory gets hurt (slightly hurt, but hurt is hurt, and there is a cast on her arm, mister), creating a serious rift in their relationship.  The receiving is two episodes later in ""Lorelai's Graduation Day"" when Rory misses the big event and offers the most high speed combined heartfelt apology and verbal self-flagellation in television history (I agree with her, I think she had a stroke or something).

My strong affection for high-speed dialogue can be traced from ""Gilmore Girls"" back to ""Moonlight"" and beyond to ""The Thing From Another World"" and any movie starring Groucho Marx.  Equally as strong is my enjoyment of gratuitous pop culture references, especially as manifested in ""The Simpsons"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  So to have a series that combines both of these elements and provides deleted scenes on the DVD is one of those absolute joys you hear so much about (although my wife is tired of me explaining all of the references, allusions, and impromptu name dropping).  Then again, while I knew from the start that Carole King was singing the show's theme song ""Where You Lead"" with her daughter Louis Goffin, I only recently figure out they had re-recorded the song with some of the lines changed to better fit the show (No, I do not fast forward through the title sequence; I always listen to the song).

I am also pleased to see that the ""Gilmore Girls"" is being seen around the world, although I have to wonder how the pop culture references translate into out cultures (I have no doubt people can speak real fast in any language).  But you can see ""Gilmore Girls"" now from Argentina (the current season is on the Warner Channel Thursdays at 21:00 with past seasons shown weekdays at 11:30 and 16:30) to the United Kingdom (Sundays at 18:00 on Nickeloden U.K.).  It is nice to think that Stars Hollow's madonna and child have gone international.",1102550400,72,4888,4.648083623693379
2142060,5,B0002Y4TOM,"What can I say: I'm obsessed with The Gilmore Girls. I simply can't get enough. Too bad Stars Hollow is fictional; otherwise I'd probably move there next week (and try to steal Luke away from Lorelai....but I digress). Simply put: this is good, quality TV. It is unique and fresh. And that's because it's got great writing and great casting/acting and that's something that is hard to find these days. And by the way it's about time those Emmy/Golden Globe people give Lauren Graham her much overdue awards -- there are comedic actresses...and then there is Lauren. She's phenomenal.

This second season has some fun bonus features and my personal fave is the guide to Gilmore-isms handbook to help the less-informed decipher those quick asides they regulary toss the viewers' way. Half of the challenge is to catch them since the dialog moves so fast, but even the most informed person will be stumped time to time since the ""isms"" are so random/diverse.

This DVD set is worth the small investment because I guarantee you will watch it time and time again, just like the first season. And speaking of seasons...when is season three making its appearance? I'm greedy for more!",1102377600,5,1177,4.850746268656716
2142061,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Like many of you I approached ""Gilmore Girls"" with caution at first.  It's a family-oriented WB borderline-soap with a decidedly girly reputation.  That has not however stopped me from becoming addicted to one of the most falling-down funny, literate and psychologically complex shows on.  It's appointment TV for me along with ""The Sopranos"", the late, lamented ""Oz"" and ""Buffy"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""  Lauren Graham is a tough-minded, brilliantly comic marvel as Lorelai Gilmore, the renegade scion of a blue-blood Connecticut family who got pregnant at 16 and by sheer force of will created a great life for her daughter.  That daughter, also named Lorelai by her mother ""in a frenzy of pain medication,"" is nicknamed Rory and is played by the angelic Alexis Bledel.  Rory in public high school has aspirations to Harvard, so Lorelai approaches her starchy, proud parents after years of estrangement. (They are played with marvelous humanity by old-pros Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop.)  They gingerly begin to rebuild their relationship in order to realize Rory's possibly spectacular future.

They say that executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino sounds exactly like the verbally agile Lorelai when she speaks.  She has created an enchanted village for the Gilmores to live in called Stars Hollow.  This is where the genius of the show kicks in.  Instead of being sticky-sweet like a hundred other small town dwellers you've seen on TV, these people are benign but uncontrollably insane eccentrics who have created a little Utopia for individualists. (Just how does Kirk hold every job in town?)  The point of ""Gilmore Girls"" is that rigid social conventionality does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with ""family values.""  You can be a super-mon like Lorelai and still be a non-conformist.  Lorelai is currently looking for the ""whole stupid Dan Quayle, two dogs and a cat, matching running suits package"" in a family, but she's not putting off living her life and raising her daughter in the meantime.  (She will probably eventually get the whole package with the gruff but good-hearted Luke, the backwards-baseball cap-wearing diner owner who everyday feeds the cooking-challenged girls.)

In the second season, we meet Jess, Luke's troubled nephew from the big city who has been sent to Stars Hollow to clean up his act.  Like a lot of fans, I am not that thrilled by the James-Dean-aping Jess, but he provokes an interesting reaction in Rory.  Normally she is the sweetest and most level-headed of girls but when she lays eyes on Jess she reveals an unsuspected streak of attraction towards the irresponsible little punk.  (Who resembles in character more than a little Rory's long-absent father.)  It appears that Rory has her own rebellion issues to work out; like mother, like daughter in more ways than one.  This is what I mean when I say this show is one of the most psychologically acute shows on TV.  Lorelai is Wonder Woman but also shows a inability to commit to a relationship with a man.  Rory is a preternaturally ""good girl"" with a  hidden but similar independent side that both delights and alarms her mother.  Richard and Emily, the grandparents, are hopelessly blinded by their own social class issues, but they desperately love their granddaughter (and reluctantly, her mother.)  It's a family that's as realistically screwed up as yours is.  If you get the ""Gilmore Girls' DVD's you will have many, many hours of great viewing pleasure you can look forward to.",1102291200,22,3496,5.087719298245614

I'm a German girl, 35 years old and I was so glad that the Gilmore Girls started to show in April over here in Germany. They broadcasted the first three seasons and I just thought ""WOW"". This show is so much fun, wit, charm and love - you have to watch it! Because I am a fan of the English language and like more the original voices than the synchronized dialogues, I bought the first season on DVD and I was so happy to be able to watch and understand it that I pre-ordered the second season as soon as it was possible.

I love how the actors play their roles. They seem to be so deep in their roles that you sometimes don't know if they are playing or if they really ARE the persons. It is so real, so wonderfully played, and I love Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson and the young Alexis Bledel, because they do their job with heart and soul. Of course every other actor on this show is great as well.

2142064,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I have been an avid fan of the Gilmore Girls show since it's first episode, mainly for its general excellence. In my opinion, I feel there's far too much sex and violence in our world and on television, and the networks have the nerve to insult our intelligence by calling it entertainment. The Gilmore Girls is pure entertainment. It deals with relationships and subject matters in a somewhat realistic manner. Not all of their episodes are tied up into neat little packages, nor do they end on a high note. It is also my way of escaping from the sadness and pain I see around me, even if it's just for an hour. I get a generally great feeling after watching this show because it also shows me that humanity, love, kindness and respect is not completely lost.

I read a certain one star review of this show, so I took the time to view other reviews by this 'critic' whom I understand is entitled to his opinion, however, most of his reviews are given one star. I'm sorry to say his review was not helpful at all, and if I were to make a decision based solely on his reviews, I would never purchase anything. He doesn't seem to like anything.

I'm happy to say that the majority of the reviews for this show are very positive and helpful, and the majority rules this time. If you want to view quality television, I highly recommend The Gilmore Girls, and when this box set is released, you will definitely not regret making this purchase.",1100044800,24,1438,4.443181818181818

2142066,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I am absolutely obsessed with Gilmore girls. I watch every new episode religiously (whilst taping it, so I can immediately watch the highlights again once it's over.) There is a sign posted on my bedroom door saying ""Do not disturb between hours of 9-10 Wednesday nights (I have Global, not the WB) on pain of death."" Yeah. So anyways, I think you get the extent of how much I love this show.

I have seen all of season two before, and let me tell you, it is definetly a great season. I am counting down the days till this release. I don't know the quality of this particular set, but I'm going to expect it to be the same as season one. The picture is good, clarity is good, and the packaging is SUPERB. There are six discs in total, with four episodes on each disc. The last disc contains two episodes and special features. I haven't watched the special features yet, but it looks to be much better than season one - a ""Film by Kirk"" is reason enough to buy the DVDs!

I have watched these episodes twice each at least, and I'm still eagerly awaiting the arrival of this DVD.",1098748800,35,1077,4.300492610837439
2142077,5,B0002Y4TOM,"This show is amazing. No, it is not a reality series (Thank God). It also does not contain special effects, vulgarities, or explicit sexual content. However, it still manages to be one of the smartest, funniest, most sarcastic, and yet, ironically, the warmest shows on television. It has the quick banter of the 30s, but it still mangages to reference what's going on in pop culture right now. You must buy this DVD!",1098576000,28,417,4.726027397260274
2142078,5,B0002Y4TOM,i will admit that i have only seen the show 4 times but all 4 times have been great. gilmore girls is a very well put together show and it is alright for teens to watch. im a teenager and i love it. im right there with rory with all the feelings and confusion that teens go through. so all you teens out there youll love it.,1098489600,12,324,3.8507462686567164
2142079,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I have been expounding the merits of Gilmore Girls since its' very first season, and continue to do so today - five years later. Like most shows, it has had its' ups and downs over time. However, I can assure you that the first and second seasons of the show are particularly fabulous and highly recommended.

This show is for individuals who want to see Intelligent, Vibrant, Hilarious, and Heart-Wrenching television - all in one amazing package. The best place to start with this show is definitely Season One. Where you are first introduced to the characters and will fall in love with them.

The Second Season is a continuation of the trials, tribulations, love stories, and heartaches of mother and daughter, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. The ""Girls"" are surrounded by the crazy town of Stars Hollow, the 'elder' Gilmores, and potential love interests. And, while the premise may sound saccharine or mundane, believe me, it is anything but! The writing infuses the show with the kind of wit, sarcasm, and emotion that other shows would kill for. And, often the plethora of emotions are captured in a single *scene*, let alone a single episode!

Lauren Graham is the rock of this show. She is absolutely astounding. I have never had a ""favorite television actress"" before her. Her dialogue delivery is bar-none the best on television, because she doesn't just get the words out at break-neck speed. She also infuses the words with the exact emotion they call for. This season shows the continuation of her engagment to Max (Scott Cohen), and the re-appearance of Christopher (David Sutcliffe), the father of her child.

Alexis Bledel is also great as Rory. In the second season she deals with confusion in her love life, as Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) comes to Stars Hollow and makes her doubt her feelings for sweet boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki). You also see her continuing struggles at the haughty Chilton Prep School.

The supporting cast is equally fantastic. Special mention goes to Kelly Bishop as Emily Gilmore - who in my mind is really the third ""Gilmore Girl"". Viewers familiar only with the first season will also get a more in-depth view of Luke (Scott Patterson), as he struggles to raise his nephew Jess. Other standouts include Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), and Keiko Agena (Lane).

This show has always been about the smaller moments in life. If you're waiting for car explosions, graphic sex, or foul language, then you're watching the wrong show. But, if you want to watch a show that will engage you, take you inside its' world, and make you care about the characters, then this is the show for you. And, let me also state that this is not just a show for women! There are guys out there who will find this show just as amusing.

So, if you were on the fence before, and wondered whether checking out this show was worth your time. Get off the fence, and jump right in. Trust me... this is definitely television worth watching.",1098316800,32,2944,4.794871794871795
2142080,5,B0002Y4TOM,"i so love this series.i have never been so devoted in watching a show in years!

I am just as thrilled if not more so with the release of the second season.  The show just keeps getting better.  The season two DVD will be amazing, like the fiirst and hopefully the rest to come.

2142082,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I been watching the show the gilmore girls from season 1. i saw that there was a new show on after my other show and i thought ""heck why not."" I watched the show and i loved it. You should give this show a try if you have never watched it. Believe me, if you don't like it the first time, watch it again i promise that it will be the best show you've ever seen. The season 2 is filled with a lot of new problems for the gilmore girls. So if you've never seen the whole 2 season of the gilmore girls and seen the first season and liked it. you should get the second seaason.

  If you don't know what it's about. Lorelai gilmore got pregnant when she was 16. when she was 17 she ran away with her child to become a maid. She is now 32 and her daughter is 16. She runs an inn and Rory (her daughter) is going to one of the highest classed schools around. The story is filled with conflicts on romance, school, mother-daughter relationships.",1096934400,9,938,4.059459459459459
2142083,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I have watched almost every single episode of ""the gilmore girls"".  And I have to say that it is one of the smartest and most pleasant show to watch.  The dialogues are sharp and the characters will keep you coming back for more.  I am not going to write a lengthy praise but to say that you won't regret watching this show.",1096848000,8,324,4.193548387096774
2142084,5,B0002Y4TOM,"Ah, what to say about Gilmore Girls. Well I could gloat that this is ""LIKE THE BEST SHOW EVER"", but that would be childish. I could say it's changed my world, but then I'd be obsessive. I could, however, mention the way it puts a smile on my face whenever I watch it and luckily for me, that only sounds borderline crazy. Gilmore Girls is truly a magnificent show. It is smart, sophisticated, sweet, wholesome, crazy, and wildly entertaining. If you're not up to date with the Gilmore craze, it goes a little something like this. The show follows Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory in their very small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. The two are virtually insepearable and have an incredibly strong bond. Because Lorelai gave birth to Rory when she was only 16, they share a connection that leans more towards best friends than mother and daughter. They are both extremely witty, intelligent women who must survive the world one step at a time, all in the midst of their crazy town, where everyone knows each other- which makes keeping things private almost impossible. Season 2 introuduces bad-boy Jess, the nephew of Lorelai's secret love interest Luke, who takes a liking to Rory. Througout the season, Lorelai struggles between being with Max and Rory's father Christopher and the strained relationship with her parents. Meanwhile, Rory confronts her usual challenges at her private school, Chilton while facing the fear of life after high school. The season culminates in a lost love, a gained love and a few important relationships that could be changed forever. If you want something the whole family or just you can enjoy, laugh at, and love than Gilmore Girls Season 2 is perfect for you! The life of Rory and her mother are what will hook you, and their relationship with each other and their community of Stars Hollow is what will continuously pull you back. Leave it to Lorelai's introduction to show you the way to this wonderful DVD: ""There are many paths in life. There's the 'Hey, you're cute- sure, I'll marry you after graduation and med school' and the 'Can you drive Susie to soccer today, 'cause I've got a pediure?' path. And then there's my path, where I found myself 16 and pregnant and I realized 'I have to get a job, I have to raise a kid and being me, I have to do it all by myself.' Not easy. But the thing with my path was, when I reached the end, I turned around and realized I'd ended up someplace really good.""",1094256000,58,2448,4.642857142857143
2142085,5,B0002Y4TOM,"The delightful thing about Gilmore Girls is that it relies on nothing but its own merits to be positively the best show on television.  With incredibly loveable characters whose relationships make you long to live in a small town, Gilmore Girls takes you to a realistic world that could only exist in your fondest dreams.  It's plots and characterization rival any of the ""best"" on television, and its charming wit brings to mind the word play and subtlety of a Jane Austen novel.  There is never a dull moment when you are watching the diaglogue-driven lives of two of the most interesting and eccentric women on TV.  The mother-daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory may not be typical, but every mother and daughter certainly wishes it were.  The dynamic of the town is at the same time frantic and refreshing, all of the unique characters blending to make an incredible ensemble.  The acting is superb, never missing a beat and is the backbone of what makes this show amazing.  If you delight in dialogue and characters that make you think, feel, and laugh yourself silly--then this is the dvd collection for you.",1093910400,20,1125,4.828125
2142086,5,B0002Y4TOM,"I'm so happy Gilmore Girls are out on dvd! It's funny, and cute and heartfelt. It's interesting looking back on the earlier seasons and seeing just how much the show has evolved since. In my opinion every season gets better and better. Although it takes place in this town which seems a little unlikely, the show still has this great sense of realness to it. I know, no one could possible talk as fast and witty as these characters do, and you might think that this could possibly become annoying, but it doesn't it just gets better and how much credit is that to the writers!!!!! This show is a serious work of art, that never gets old. For those of you who are already GG fans, I really enjoyed viewing the Season 1 episodes again, it was neat to flashback to the beginning. For those of you who have never watched the show, I urge you to check it out, you might find some great deals on used Season 1's you never know! One of my biggest motivations for buying this tv show is not only because it's my favorite still airing tv show, but because it something I hope to share with my kids one day. With the wave of reality tv, and a whole lot of other garbage, who knows where tv will be by then. I will treasure this dvd set and someday in my older-age rediscover Stars Hollow.",1093824000,17,1278,4.2633744855967075

Contrived situations, silly love triangles, fickle girls, and characters too lazy to make their own coffee or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, they go to a place called Luke's to be waited on. I don't know what happened to the main protagonists in this series, the slutty mom and her daughter, and I don't care. There's too much good stuff out there to waste time with silly series like this puff piece.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,1913,5.563573883161512
