1345769,5,B00004S2Y7,"The Armchair Trainer video has helped me solve many of the problems I was having with my 80 pd. golden retreiver ""Rowdy"". I found this video to be not only helpful but unique in the fact that most of the basic  commands can be taught while sitting in a chair. Thanks to The Armchair  Trainer video, Rowdy now sits and lies down nicely at my side while I work  at the computer instead of jumping and grabbing at my hands all the time.",952905600,10,433,4.192771084337349
7921675,1,B00004S2Y7,"Please do not support the cruel and outdated methods of training used in this video and by the her training center in Atlanta. I spent a few weeks there and was appalled by the abuse under the guise of ""training"".  Her solution for barking dogs is to muzzle them! Dogs have to pant to control their temperature! She has no business training people to train dogs!",1167091200,,362,4.484848484848484
7921676,1,B00004S2Y7,"This video is awful. Why would anyone choke their dog like the sadist pretending to be a dog trainer in this video?
I understood a little better reading the more realistic reviews - apparently, the video trainer is a fraud, which would sure explain the cruel punishments that she puts animals through. I shudder to think that people pay her in real life to train a dog - they must be crazy!",1087689600,4,390,4.430555555555555
7921677,1,B00004S2Y7,"Cruel, outdated training methods used by a no talent dog trainer ( sorry, ask around in the Greater Atlanta Area if anyone has heard of this woman as a trainer, they just laugh and use the word ""self-promoting"" alot )
Bad advice given in a cheesy, poorly shot tape that fails to explain vital training concepts - this tape would not be worth viewing, even if it was free. Sad for the poor suckers that actually bought this piece of junk tape.
I notice that the people that are happy with the tape are all glad that they can sit while training. Maybe they need to consider getting a cat instead.",1087516800,4,594,4.36036036036036
7921678,5,B00004S2Y7,"My father has been in a wheelchair for over twelve years.  After seeing a film on T.V. about goldens being great wheelchair companions, I decided to  give my father a golden retreiver puppy for his 62nd birthday. My father  named her puppy Mary.  When I brought Mary home, my father and I quickly  realized this puppy  needed training. After purchasing several videos off  of the internet, we realized that none of the videos had any information on  wheelchair training. Finally I found a video called The Armchair Trainer on  Amazon.com.  To our surprise, The Armchair Trainer was the only video that  offered wheelchair training.  After purchasing the video, my father and I  started Mary's  training. We have been working with Mary for over four  months and can see a great improvement in my father's ability to control  Mary.  My family and I highly recommend this training video regardless of  whether there is a need for a wheelchair or not. It was definitly the most  informative and helpful video that we bought.",969408000,14,1020,4.859649122807017
7921679,5,B00004S2Y7,"I purchased this video for my son so he would learn how to train his new  dog. He followed the instructions, and now he has a well trained and  behaved pet.
I read one review that was not very flattering. I think the  reviewer forgot the video was made to teach beginners how to train their  pets. Its not a video for AKC finishing.",969235200,8,332,4.140625
7921680,5,B00004S2Y7,"Finally, a dog training video that I have not layed to rest on my dusty shelf!  After working a 10 hour day, the last thing I want to do is to have to take my boxer Tyson out for a walk and train him. I never thought poeple  could train their dog while sitting in a chair. With this video I have  tought Tyson to lie down at my side while I watch T.V. (for 20 minutes)and  sit at my side when I have friends over.",968889600,3,413,3.7674418604651163
7921681,5,B00004S2Y7,"Good video!  Saved me a lot of time and money by showing me how to do  everything myself.  My Pomeranian, Lab, and Cockapoo were following  commands after just a few days!  Also, some of the training aids from the  video are such a relief!  My lab learned to ring the little bells when he  needs to go out, and with one squirt of the sour spray has learned not to  bark at strangers- I would recommend this video to anyone!  Terrific, fast  and helpful!",968716800,8,453,4.273809523809524
7921682,5,B00004S2Y7,"The author, Mrs. Joan Lask has had many years experience teaching and training people how to work with dogs of all breeds and sizes.  She is very lively yet has the patience of Job.  The trick to training is getting the  owners actively involved.  Joan shows how to become a happy dog owner in an  entertaining, interesting manner.  Anyone who has watched her training  classes in person can appreciate this film more.  I am one of those so  fortunate.
Joan also teaches people to become dog trainers. So, part of  her thrust in the film also includes topics helpful to those who may view  dog training as a vocation.  The director helped Joan show various aspects  of her ""armchair method,"" in the video such as training a dog how  to sit while working on the WWW.
Joan does not have the name recognition  of Barbara Woodhouse yet but her techniques and skills are comparable.  I  highly recommend this video for the potential dog owner, those who have  just acquired a pet and people encountering behavioral difficulties with  their beloved dogs. This is one video that will be viewed again and again  as well as kept for reference.

7921683,5,B00004S2Y7,I don't know if it gets any easier to train a dog. The Armchair Trainer video took me step-by-step through the process of training my American Bulldog. I have tried taking him through obedience classes before but it  never quite worked out. The Armchair Trainer method really works!,959126400,5,282,4.875
7921684,5,B00004S2Y7,"I thought my dog was perfect since I have trained it to sit, lay-down and come. However, since I trained my dog with food it only obeys me when I have food. After using this video, and training my dog the correct way, my  dog obeys my commands in any situation. Thanks U-Train!",954115200,9,277,4.226415094339623
