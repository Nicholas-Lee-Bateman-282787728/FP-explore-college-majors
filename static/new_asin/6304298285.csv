840351,2,6304298285,"I was not expecting to be dissapointed by a film featuring BOTH Robin Williams and Bill Cosby.  Two of the funniest men on the planet, you think they could have managed to squeak a few laughs out of me.  To be perfectly honest, though, this movie, while it has that Coppela-esque ambition, never even achieves the depth of a made-for-Disney channel movie.  It ends up feeling pretentious.  I only wanted it to be funny.  Instead it wasn't really . . . anything.  Forgetable is the only word for it.",974246400,3,498,4.53932584269663
840352,5,6304298285,"This is an awsome movie! it's one of my top favorites! It's about a boy who as he grows up, he grows up, and I mean grows up! like he ages, lets say when he was 12 he would look like hes 30, and when he graduated he looked like he was 80. It's a very good movie, and Mario Yedidia is in it, and hes hott!",970272000,,304,3.5522388059701493
840353,5,6304298285,I thought Jack was a great movie. I think it is neat how the neighborhood kids love when Jack comes out and plays. I think this is one of Robins best films of all time. But I love all his films. I give him and his movies 5  stars.,956361600,,230,3.693877551020408
840354,4,6304298285,"The characters where great and fun,as the story. Very charming,emotive and completly funny. A Hollywood style great movie. A new concept of Coppola's films. It's cliched but enjoyful.",922665600,,183,5.571428571428571
840355,1,6304298285,"Unbelieveably bad fare from the maker of such masterpieces as Apocolypse Now and the Godfather trilogy.  Williams is well suited for the role, but the story really goes nowhere.  It's a fairly offensive film when you think  about the actual children afflicted with this hyper aging condition, they  certainly have nowhere near the fun Williams has in this movie.",912729600,8,362,5.084745762711864

841038,1,6304298285,"The one 'star' review is not based on the movie. The movie itself is pretty great. However, it took us a couple of days to watch it because the movie kept 'freezing', and it would take a while before it came back on. This has only happened to me once before with a movie download from Amazon, but it gets frustrating. I do not think it was a fault on our end since I reset it everything, and when we gave up the first night, we rented something else, and had no problem with that. All the stoping, waiting, then going made it hard to keep interest in the movie.",1477526400,,561,4.109090909090909

841139,2,6304298285,"Robin Williams is great but the movie itself is a misfire. Weak script, bad jokes, and the personality of the kids and Williams himself is a little off. There's one scene in particular that is a good example of what I mean. Jack is supposed to be 10 years old and he walks into his parents bedroom, wakes them up, and asks them if he can sleep with them because he's scared. What ten year old wants to sleep in their parents bed? Maybe a 4 or 5 year old but not a ten year old, it's just laughable the way the kids are portrayed in this movie. Very cartoonish. The plot is predictable, the acting isn't the best, it's just forgettable. Harmless, but very forgettable.",1474070400,,667,4.301587301587301

I am an educator, and the inevitable end of the school year is always fraught with bad behavior on the part of students who are ready to cut loose for the summer. Viewing ""Jack"" was a breath of fresh air. Williams was spot on as Jack, and his speech at the end of the film was more than a little bittersweet in that he has now passed on.

842785,5,6304298285,"I love Robin Williams. I was so sad when he passed away in such a tragic way.  I ordered all of his movies that I had not seen yet. Jack, was one of those movies. I don't usually like just straight comedic films, but I want all of his movies. So, after reading a short paragraph about the movie, I decided to try it, as the main actor was Williams.
I was very pleasantly surprised with this film! At first it seemed like it was going to be just another ZANY comedy. But, as the movie progresses, you become more engaged with Jack as he grows up from a child to manhood, all in a man's body. He knows he is different from the other kids, but he still wishes to play and learn like any other child. You live through his dreams, his excitement, his joys, his struggles and his sorrows.
The movie is rated PG-13, but having 6 grandchildren I feel that  an 8 to 10 year old would benefit from this film. It will teach that many people are different from the norm. It will teach that it is OK to be different. It will teach that all of us, no matter what we look like, no matter where we were born, want to be loved and accepted by others. Most importantly, it will teach that we can live a fun fulfilling life, that we can be loved that we can be triumphant.",1411344000,8,1253,4.0894308943089435

842903,3,6304298285,"JACK is directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Robin Williams in the title role of a boy who ages at four times the natural rate. While somewhat of an oddball choice for Coppola, known especially for the Godfather trilogy, this material is rather characteristic for Williams in this period of his career.

 Basically, it's a sentimental dramedy that elicits laughter and tugs at the heartstrings. However, this is clearly one of Williams' lesser films. The situation felt contrived and silly, merely an excuse for Williams to engage in puerile antics. What was more astonishing is that this entire film was played straight by everyone. I did laugh some, particularly at a couple scenes involving the physical comedy of Robin Williams playing a 10-year-old in a 40-year-old man's body, but I didn't laugh as much as I would have liked. The moments where they go for poignancy also fell flat a lot of the time, again mostly because of the contrived situation.

 However, the film is generally well-acted. Of course Robin Williams does a fine job, but Diane Lane and Bill Cosby in particular turn in good performances as well. Jennifer Lopez and Fran Drescher also show up, but more as eye candy for horny boys than anything. Looking at recent cases involving teachers sleeping with their students, the implications of the scenes involving Jack and those two characters might come off as irresponsible, the subject matter is handled as tastefully as possible (as opposed to something like THAT'S MY BOY, in which Adam Sandler plays a man-child of sorts). I did find one scene between Fran Drescher and Robin Williams as tender, but nothing more.

 Given the circumstances surrounding Jack's life, you might think that the film goes for a tearjerker of an ending, but it doesn't. Still, I do feel like the closing speech, which sums up the message of the movie, was tacked on and unnecessary to a degree. It was a sentiment better expressed in Williams' earlier movies, such as DEAD POETS SOCIETY. Overall, while still funny and touching in mostly equal measure, the direction was flat and story was about as inspiring as a Lifetime movie. For die-hard Robin Williams fans (or of Francis Ford Coppola) only. Everyone else would do well to skip it.",1410566400,,2247,4.9

I have loved him ever since Mork & Mindy, in everything, from his serious works to the hilarious ones.  Perhaps this movie improved over time, but I couldn't wait that long!  I was expecting Tom Hanks' genius in ""Big"" magnified ten-fold.  One of the first scenes we see Williams portraying 10-year old Jack is played opposite the great Bill Cosby, so we all had tissues ready, expecting to laugh so hard we cried.  Nothing.  Almost painful to watch.  And there was more painful where that came from, in more ways than one.  Jack's plight was so awfully sad (again, at least in the beginning of the movie), but it was intellectually sad instead of emotionally moving given that Williams did not deliver a believable character.  Basically, we wanted to feel something.  No genuine emotion.  No cuteness.  No slapstick.  A story with potential, maybe viewers who stick it out til the end will be rewarded in ways that we weren't.",1408320000,3,1017,4.677966101694915

843373,5,6304298285,"Have you ever seen a movie that you felt was underrated, yet understood why it was underrated, at the same exact time?

Trust me; I know it sounds weird. While Jack is one of my all-time favorite films, I do not condemn those who did not enjoy it. Some of the humor is very immature, and with the PG-13 rating, it may divert young children dealing with peer pressure from learning the message it offers to all ages: especially to those children who succumb to peer pressure and those whowith a mental disability, handicap, etc.are targeted by cruel children who bully others with these same problems and, in addition, their friends as well.

What if I told you, however, that Jack goes by the book: and, in presenting immaturity, presents it in a rebound of joy, for the films central character?

I concur with my point below:

Jack stars Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy with Werners syndrome. If youve never heard of WS, its a form of Progeria, the same illness of Rabbi Harold S. Kushners son that inspired the bestselling book When Bad Things Happen to Good People (see my review): rapid aging which causes a young boy to look like an old man. Jack, born premature at the very beginning of his (fictional) picture, is revealed to have been shaving since he was four years old: and, at the age of ten, lived in a forty-year-old mans body! Robin Williams was 44 years old when he signed onto play Jack, and with his physical appearance and knack for comedic and serious acting alike, he nails the role to perfection.

With Francis Ford Coppola as our director, Coppola guides Williams/Jack as they enjoy a very childlike life: watching butterflies in a garden, playing pranks against their bullies, and hiding in a box: sometimes out of an attempt to have fun, sometimes out of an attempt to conceal themselves from this cruel world. Very early on, we see Williams/Jack take on a childlike leap of faith: enrolling in a local public school at the advice of his tutor Mr. Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a very sentimental, meaningful role), and facing off against the world as it really is, warts and all.

And it is through this that we see young Jack Powell conquer the world not by hiding from it, but by confronting it. His leap of faith proves itself valid when Jack joins a group of his fellow fifth graders in playing basketball against not necessarily their bullies, but intermediate-school archenemies, and helping them win the victory: more times than just one! Pretty soon, Jack will win the love of not only his fellow classmates, but also a divorced mother of one (Adam Zolotin) who has no clue shes flirting with a ten-year old (Fran Drescher)! But he will be up against quite a lot as well, when his body starts to progress past the age of forty, and when he experiences his first romantic heartbreak: his teacher, Miss Marquez (Jennifer Lopez), turning him down for a date at the school dance, understanding that she is the only female at the school who appears to be Jacks age at least in height (not in facial appearance, etc.), but realizingunlike Jackthat because she is his teacher and a grown woman, they could both be prosecuted for dating each other, when Jack, in spite of his physical appearance, is only ten years old.

I know, I know: already, this sounds a bit like heavy material for a movie that delivers a message about peer pressure to those who are victims of it and those who are targeted for being different (both categories apply to me). Some of the humor even seems like its more directed solely towards men than men and women alike, a negative aspect to a film with a message for all ages: and, along with them, all sexes as well. However, if you think back to when you were in the fifth grade, and you remember the people it was considered uncool to hang out with, its very easy to overlook Jacks immaturity. The immaturity is not here for the sake of tooting its own horn; rather; its here to bring joy to the faces in the audience, in seeing Robin Williams/Jack Powell finally finding a place to call home among other boys his age. (Note: Williams himself was frequently outcast in school while growing up.) In all of this, Francis Ford Coppola reminds us that its on the inside that counts; with the adventures he puts Robin Williams/Jack Powell and their friends through, and teaches us to cherish life and look for large and small miracles alike, wherever we go. Youll laugh, youll cry, youll learn and, at the very same time, youll have fun!

I wish there were bonus features on this DVD, but regardless, JACK is one movie you want to be sure not to miss.",1394841600,,4612,4.588592233009709

Jack realizes at the age of 10 that he's tired of being home-schooled and wants to go to school so he can interact with other kids his age and make friends. Only problem is that he looks like a 40 year old man. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and I loved it back then and I still think it's a great movie. It's shows how precious your time on this earth can be. Jack never had the chance to experience the full life he was meant to have. By the time he graduated he was almost 70 years old.

843936,4,6304298285,"Robin Williams, although an immensely funny and energetic comedian, has the raw acting talent to make you truly believe in his characters. He can emotionally engage you and allows for his supporting cast to remain prominent in his films without being overshadowed by the big characters that he plays. Patch Adams & Mrs. Doubtfire are two very fine examples of how Robin Williams can present an immensely funny character, yet retains a level of depth and reality that allow for the hysterical laughter without sacrificing the emotional importance of what his films are ultimately about. He achieves this just as well in Jack.

The film is based around the main character, Jack. He is a child born with a rapid aging disability like that of the real condition known as Progeria. The parents are naturally shocked and upset by this news, but make a pledge to allow him as good a life as possible. Fast forward a few years and we see a child in the body of a grown man (Robin Williams) who has been secluded from the outside world by his parents to protect him from the cruelties and judgments of the real world. His home school tutor Lawrence (Bill Cosby) recommends to Jacks parents that he should be put into a public school so he can socialise and make friends.

Anybodies first day of school is a terrifying one, but for Jack it's even more so thanks to him being in the body of a fully grown man entering an elementary school. Naturally his fellow classmates are a bit wary of this stranger in their classroom and keep well away whilst inventing stories. Mrs. Marquez (Jennifer Lopez), his teacher, warms quickly to Jack and strongly wants him to make friends and be accepted by his classmates. After being asked to join a team in a basketball game because of his height, he quickly becomes part of a group of friends who start to look past his appearance and recognise the kid within him.

This is an immensely sweet and heart warming film and is personally one of my favourites starring the comic legend that is Robin Williams. It's largely unrecognised on the mainstream film stage and I would love it to get more recognition than it did then and does now. It's up there with the likes of Mrs. Doubtfire and Patch Adams. Although it's not as blatantly funny, it's more so an emotional piece with a strong message to deliver to us all about acceptance of the personality within everybody. Looking past the appearance and accepting people, warts and all.

Directed by the legend of Francis Ford Coppola, there's no denying that this would have been an immensely enjoyable movie going piece. The inclusion of comedy legend Bill Cosby is also a delight and although he doesn't have a largely comic prominence, it's still a great thing to see him in the film. This is one of Jennifer Lopez' first movies and although I'm not crazy over her acting, she doesn't do a bad job overall. Williams is the true gem though and truly creates a believable and sweet character that we're all hoping will succeed in making friends.

I would highly recommend this to any fans of Robin Williams as it's truly one of his greatest.",1241222400,29,3114,4.6442831215970966

843941,2,6304298285,"One gloomy night in August, Brain Powell and Karen Powell (Brain Kerwin and Diane Lane) decided they would like to be parents.  Two months later at a Halloween party Karen realized that the baby was ready to get out after only two months.  Had the baby ripped out Aliens-style, this movie would have no doubt been better; however, it wasn't meant to be.  Nonetheless, the Halloween-spawn came forth as Karen delivered what essentially turned out to be the Wolfman.

It turns out that Karen delivered her baby, Jack (Robin Williams), seven months early because he's aging at four-times the rate of a normal human.  What was left out of the explanation, however, was that along with the quadrupled growth rate, Jack had hair growth at roughly 25 times the normal rate.  That's the only explanation for Jack ending up looking like a 40 year old wearing a fur coat or an extra for Planet of the Apes.  Given Williams' resemblance to the guy one step from the right on the evolutionary chart, I suppose the premise is not all that unbelievable.  Williams playing an innocent, character who diddles and fidgets like a child, on the other hand, is just awkward.

Anyway, by the time Jack is ready for school he looks like a middle-aged adult.  He eventually ends up going to public school where he's horribly out of place, and it's much worse than you would expect for a movie in which Robin Williams plays a grade-schooler.  In all the appropriate places, where a child interacts with parents, a heartwarming pause is felt by all.  Except anyone with a pulse.  Essentially he's the proverbial turd in a punchbowl.  It's just Robin Williams hamming it up for the camera for 2 hours, basically the same thing he did in the ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" video - a grown man willing to flush his dignity down the toilet in order to do ridiculous things that only he finds amusing.

Thank goodness for the combined efforts of the talented and gorgeous Diane Lane, and the sexy, nubile school teacher played by Jennifer Lopez.  If not for those two, this atrocity of a movie may have caused riots.  I only recommend this movie for severely deranged masochists.",1221955200,2,2142,4.6997319034852545

well this one, it seems that robin williams holds back a little, where i thought he would be more pressing with the character, as some of his comedy has revolved around doing impressions of a ten year old or something along those lines..

he seems more careful in this movie than sponaneous-wild like he will usually do ! ~

its about two hours long, so it tends to be slow at time, but there *are* a few gem scenes based on robin williams spontaneous humour..

there are some really funny scenes where he is playing off of the motiff of being a 10 year old child..

i want to edit those into my own robin williams funniness video ~  ha ha

it seems to restrain itself a little, the movie, to try to be a family-oriented work..  i think robin williams would have been more unleashed if it were say rated r or something..

i don't know about you, but i am becoming a fan of robin williams movies, i started with his serious ones (1 hour photo) then started watching the comedies when i got all of those..

so when i saw 'jack' that night at my local Kmart store.. i was like... 'yeeEeEeEahHhhsss!' ha ha..

i don't even know half the r. williams movies out there, there seem to be a lot, and i didn't know this one existed, but.. 'robin williams..  as a 10-year-old child??...  this has got to be either godawful or great or both!'  ha ha

 ok i think it is a little of both...  but thats what i love about r. williams movies  : D

  also i like re-playing it a lot just for the sake of watching it again when im bored.",1133568000,,1621,4.144694533762058

Well, it's this very real, rare disease that causes children to age 10 years for every year they live.

  Robin Williams gives an outstanding performance in ""Jack"", a movie about a boy with an extreme growing disorder.
  We first see Mrs. Powell dressed as a witch at a costume party from which she is rushed to a hospital where she gives birth to Jack Powell after being pregnant for only ten weeks.  We learn that Jack has a disorder that causes him to grow four times the normal human rate.
  We then see Jack spending his days lonely and holed up in his home, a ten year-old boy that has the physical body of a forty year-old man.  Bill Cosby plays Jack's private instructor, who homeschools him.
  Finally, after prodding from his instructor, Jack's parents allow him to go to school.
  Jack is at first shunned and ridiculed by his fellow fifth-graders, but slowly earns their friendship by proving that you can't judge a book by its cover.
  The movie ends at Jack's high school graduation.  Jack was valedictorian and gives a powerful speech.  By this time Jack appears to be an elderly man, but is really 18.
  Jack is a heart warming and laughter provoking movie about enjoying life while you have it, and I highly recommend it.
J: 4/5 Stars
  ""When a shooting star streaks through the blackness turning night into day, make a wish and think of me and make your life spectacular.  I know I did.""  -Robin Willliams as Jack
  Jack is a bittersweet tale about a boy who, despite certain setbacks, is determined to live and enjoy his childhood.
  The movie begins after an odd premature birth, where we learn that Jack ages at four times the average rate.  Because of this he is kept out of society for ten years.  Jack is visited by a tutor (Bill Cosby) every day.  Although the tutor likes teaching Jack, he realizes that he is lonely and convinces Jack's parents to insert him into the public education system.  At first he isn't too popular, but finally he wins over the class by using his condition to his advantage.  The ways he gets them to accept him are refreshingly true: he can buy porno magazines  and dominate the basketball courts.  However, Jack has several confrontations with the adult world.  His attempts of getting together with his school teacher fails and ends up getting in a brawl at at the local bar.  It doesn't help when he recieves a ""what I want to be when I grow up"" assignment that truly affects him.  When his friends are twenty he will probably be dead.  The movie ends with a speech of triumph that is both tear jerking and heart warming.
  Robin Williams definitely wins the best perfomance award.  Here, he is able to bring a poignancy to the role while capturing the youthfulness of being a kid.  Francois Ford Coppolay who is usually the director of hard, serious dramas, (see the Godfather) has taken a different route by making a human drama enclosed by comedy.  Because of this, he has made one of the most honest movies in recent years.  Jack is a joy to watch and a movie to treasure.",1057536000,3,2942,4.534351145038168

Robin Williams is the all-time greatest comedian, and I especially love how they put Bill Cosby in it! This movie is funny, sad, and very touching, especially twoards the end.

844140,1,6304298285,"""Jack"" is an atrocious little chunk of excrement that is about as funny as a toothache!
In ""Jack"" we find Robin Williams as a boy who just happens to grow four times the normal rate physically (when he is five he has the body of a 20 year old, when he is ten he has the body of a 40 year old, etc). However, his mental growth matches his actual age, leading to obvious problems.
The concept is truly an original and fascinating one with the potential for many laughs. Unfortunately, ""Jack"" is poorly executed, relying heavily on tasteless crudity devoid of wit.
Robin Williams would seem to be the perfect pick for this boy stuck in an adult's body. However, Robin is a major disappointment; Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head in his review in which he points out that this is Robin Williams being Robin Williams, not Robin Williams playing a ten year old with a 40 year old's body. Robin is silly, but he never exhibits the honest emotions and reactions of an actual child.
Perhaps the most disappointing and shocking aspect of ""Jack"" is that it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola! I had to do a triple take when looking at the credits! I would have expected so much more from one of the best directors of all time! If I were Coppola, I would have had ""Allen Smithee"" direct this boondoggle, if you know what I mean.",1014854400,11,1321,4.395918367346939
