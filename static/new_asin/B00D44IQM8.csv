5773396,5,B00D44IQM8,"First off I'm not very impartial because I've been reading Golgo 13 since I was 12-13 years old. I'm now 46. So as a fan I can whole heartily recommend this entire series. Despite the other releases of ""The Professional"" the first animated movie, or ""Queen Bee"" the 2nd or the 2 live action films....this series of 50 cartoons each episode based off of one of Golgo 13 Manga (Japanese comic book) adventures is without a doubt the most faithful adaptation of the character. It's wonderfully animated and brilliantly voice acted/dubbed.  You will not be disappointed.",1377129600,,566,4.895833333333333
5773397,5,B00D44IQM8,"Since I already got them all when they were selling them separately year ago, Collection 1, 2, 3, and 4.  But this time they're selling the whole set for $98.00 Dollar just the DVD (non-blueray disc), but if you want Blue-ray Disc it'll be $115.00 dollar.  The entire set won't come out till Sept 17th 2013 I believe.

If Money isn't the issue, than I would get Blue-ray Disc.  I noticed someone complains about the price on Blue-ray disc, he'll want to get DVD one the $98.00 dollar one instead.  I think its reasonable price.. Because back than it cost me nearly $45.00 dollar just for each Collection.. so 4 Collection times $45.00 = $180.00.

See the huge difference on the price before, and now with entire set DVD is merely $98.00 dollar, but Blue-Ray disc is $115.00.

I'm thinking about getting Blue-Ray disc, not on release am thinking about getting it in Dec this year.  Golgo 13 is a excellent series, I couldn't stop watching it after few time.  >.<",1375488000,4,961,4.573099415204679
5773398,5,B00D44IQM8,"Awesome collection of Mr. Golgo13, includes 50 different missions with a variety of tactics on how he accomplishments his hits, includes very intense action scenes along with unexpected double crosses, and lets not forget the love scenes, which is all on this 9 disc collection.

5773407,5,B00D44IQM8,"Limited anime animation, but stylish and very very faithful to the Manga.  There is no connecting story between these episodes, and few recurring characters.  But there IS a thematic thread, and it has to do with who Golgo is.  Several episodes seem to explore the extremes of the character: has he ever shown compassion? Ever loved? Who was his toughest opponent?  Does he have any blood relations?  By exploring the limits, you define the center.  Love this collection, and so will you if you enjoy the stories of the world's greatest assassin.",1423612800,6,546,4.880434782608695

5773419,5,B00D44IQM8,"It's a great, classic anime. The English dub can be a bit hokey at times. I really enjoy the fact that this series is very cerebral in their approach with the way Golgo 13 gets out of every situation at hand. Good Stuff....",1410307200,4,223,4.209302325581396

5773421,5,B00D44IQM8,"I really dig the english dubbing to this program. Hearing the character's voices is incredible especially the assassin himself. Some episodes do have sad moments and when Golgo starts his missions, he never gets killed. Wow!",1393286400,5,224,5.25

5773423,5,B00D44IQM8,"A great series based off a great graphic novel series! If you're a Golgo 13 fan, this is a must have!

-Story:
If you're unfamiliar with the character: Golgo 13 is known by the crime, espionage, and political world as the best assassin for hire. He has never failed a job and has a perfect shot. Rivals who go against him are always defeated, and if a client disobeys Golgo's rules, they'll be killed. This TV series is based on episodes from the Golgo 13 graphic novel series from Takao Saito and Saito Productions. None of the episodes are a direct ""sequel"" to each other. There are a few recurring characters, but they're presence is VERY rare. You can start at any episode and pretty much be all set, but watching this series from beginning to end is the best way to experience it.

-Animation:
The show doesn't have the best animation around, but it is VERY detailed. The animators did a perfect job of taking the graphic novel series' unique Gekiga art style and making it look modern and clean.

-Voice Acting:
This is sadly the worst part of the show. For the most part, the voice acting is very high end. Ever character sounds appropriately voiced to how they look, but around the later episodes, the VO gets AWFUL! Some characters sound extremely silly. This is good for a laugh, but the poor VO comes up at very inappropriate times to ruin the mood of the show. A very sad or suspenseful moment could be ruined from just one character's silly voice. Many voice actors are re-used to voice different characters in different episodes, which is fine, because every episode has many new characters in it, and I'm assuming the dub for this show wasn't given a great budget, so the studio could only afford so many actors and actresses. I will say this, though: Whoever casted David Wald to play Duke/Golgo is a genius! Out of every English voice actor to ever play Golgo (including the horrible dub of The Kowloon Assignment), Wald is definitely THE BEST! His voice matches the character's look and presence perfectly, and he only gives few moments of cringe-worthy delivery throughout the series.

-Music:
Simply perfect for what the show is. Ever tune matches perfectly with whats being displayed, and it's very good music overall.

-Final thoughts:
I am a huge fan of the Golgo 13 graphic novel, the four movies, and the two NES video games. Anyone who is a fan of the series and it's main character will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Even though I pointed out some flaws, I still think it's great! Anyone looking to get into the series, I recommend the show to you!",1389225600,19,2566,4.618421052631579

8589341,5,B00D44IQM8,"I already have the DVD collection of Golgo 13 but I was thinking the Blueray picture would be way sharper and more crisp detail. I was wrong. The Blueray looks exactly like the DVD version when watching the show. The only noticeable difference is on the title screen of disc 1 of the Blueray the picture of Golgo 13 is very clear and detailed with no music. The Blueray discs title screen has the title name of the episodes next to the episode number when selecting a specific episode. The DVD just has the episode number and no name until the episode begins. There are more episodes on the Blueray (9 total compared to the DVD having only 6). The DVD also has music on the title screens and a different picture that is not as clear as the Blueray version. Another noticable thing between the two is the sound volume. My dvd version seems a little softer about 5 bars softer than the Blueray. The Blueray is much louder with better sound than the DVD. I have a 32 inch Sony Bravia tv with no surround sound. Also on the beginning intro opening scene when you play an episode, it is more crisp and clearer than the DVD and it goes same for the closing credits. When watching the actual show the Blueray graphics compared to the DVD graphics are pretty much identical. My TV is on full screen but I have to put it on WIDE MODE: FULL to make it identical to the Blueray size. With the Blueray its automatic the picture size.  They made the entire collection together after the series was completed. I bought my set one by one as soon as they came available on amazon. So I do not have the DVD set that has all the discs together. I have 4 different collection DVD cases with two discs in each. The Blueray set comes with 6 discs and they have their own plastic page to place each disc in and not like those pesky cases where there stacked in the same side and touching each other halfway and you have to take out one disc to get the other etc. So the Blueray is a nice set without hassle. I thought there would be more extras on the Blueray but its the same as the DVDs. The Blueray special features are all on the last disc #6. On the DVD its on the first disc. The Special Features are identical on the Blueray and the DVD if you call them Special Features. There is only previews of other Sentai Anime, DVD credits, and Clean Opening and Clean Closing. Clean Opening is like the begining of the episodes where they just show Golgo 13 pictures and him in action while cool japanese singing is being played and Clean Close is the ending of each episode also with cool japanese singing and I guess they call it both clean because there are no words or credits, just anime. In these episodes there are missions that Golgo 13 goes through and they are not related to each other except some characters that come back like his gunsmith with his buck teeth. Golgo 13 keeps you guessing. These dudes think they figured him out and challenge Golgo 13 but they always croak wondering what happend. I guess you could call this soft hentai but very soft. Golgo 13 makes out with dames but just stills and no thrusting. Just moans of passion and big ones with some cheeks. No real dirty pounding. So if you are searching for thrills then this wouldn't be good. Try some hentai with tentacles like La Blue Girl or The Legend of The Overfiend. Golgo 13 is more action and suspense that keeps you guessing and on your feet wondering what is his next move and how will he do it. Not all of the episodes are super good and top notch. Golgo 13 takes on some silly missions but most episodes are good. I was worried back when they were making these DVDs because collection 1 and 2 came out pretty fast after each other than the Japan tsunami happend and there was a big gap. I was hoping that they were ok there. It was a very hard time. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. Miraculously after a while collection 3 did come out and collection 4 a short time after so I was very happy. Golgo 13 is my cartoon hero. I loved him every since I played the NES games Golgo 13: TOP SECRET EPISODE & THE MAFAT CONSPIRACY. I went nuts buying all of his comics and books. There are all kinds of figures of him too. I grew up in the era of He-man, She-ra, Transformers, Silver Hawks, Thunder Cats (snarf snarf), GoBots, Turbo Teen, Mr. T cartoon, GT Performer and Bmx bikes, the Bmx movie RAD, and Back to the Future. This Blueray set is worth it. It costs a little more than the DVD set but either way they are really similar with no huge differences. If I didn't have any set I would go straight for the Blueray first. If you are a Golgo 13 fan then this set is a definite must have! Even if you are not a fan I'm sure it will be a sweet addition to your manga hentai anime collection.",1490486400,11,4771,4.260198456449834
