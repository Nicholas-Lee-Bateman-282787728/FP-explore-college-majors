5736157,5,B00CRVL5WC,My Name Is Earl: Seasons 1-4. I can't believe this series only had 4 seasons. I think it is one of the funniest shows ever to be on TV.,1388448000,2,135,3.689655172413793
5736158,3,B00CRVL5WC,".....with the BEST of intentions, it seems. A redeeming premise
to be sure, but they soon ran out of that and the language had to
start flowing from the gutter.
Having known ""Earl-types,"" the premise made a LOT of sense.
Then, as the series ""progressed,"" Earl's ex-wife became quite
ANNOYING with her language and ""machinegunning"" words.

One of the funniest episodes was ""SWEET JOHNNY."" But, it HAD
to have the left-wing view of gun ownership and use. It showed all
the WRONG things to say and do about firearms (from the character who
used firearms in his former ""profession""), without really TEACHING anything
about RESPONSIBLE gun ownership. Then, of course, we HAVE to
have ""race"" shoved down our throats...
One episode- ""Witch Lady,"" just HAD to have Randy say ""Bi-ch,"" instead of
""Witch.""
I can see WHY the Network Execs cancelled the series as it did. It got 'old'-
""Joy"" was a cheap-type who would cheat on ANYONE, it seemed.",1382227200,2,934,4.8375
5736159,5,B00CRVL5WC,I would definately order from here again. It did not take long to get the movies and we enjoy them so much.,1320969600,,107,3.909090909090909
5736160,5,B00CRVL5WC,"Before I ordered the videos, I had a question and sent an email which was promptly answered. Once ordered, they arrived on time as promised in the brand new unopened condition promised.",1288828800,,185,4.8125
5736161,5,B00CRVL5WC,"...buy them separately, as the ""one-star"" reviewer said.

I bought Seasons One,Two, and Three at the store, and got Season Four here on Amazon.

This short-lived series has some of the best writing of any TV series you'll watch (only an opinion); pay close attention to the little details and the continuity, as well as the little subtleties one might miss with casual viewing. It is an exercise in masterful story-telling, and repeated viewings of many of these episodes get funnier with each viewing.

The cast is populated with many eccentric characters who are the residents of fictional Camden County, mainly Bruce Campbell lookalike Jason Lee as Earl Hickey, accompanied through thick and thin by his loyal child-like brother Randy, his ex-wife Joy and her current husband Darnell, aka ""Crabman,"" their two sons Dodge and Earl Jr, and exotic illegal immigrant Catalina, who could easily cause a traffic accident by simply walking down the street...I defy any man to not fall hard for her at first glance (""Dibs!""~~quote from Randy).

""Earl's"" voice is somewhat pinched and scratchy, and he often talks at the upper register of his vocal range, and since every episode is rife with lots of narration, it can be a little grating. But looking past this is fairly easy, and he really does come off as an excellent story teller.

If you can find the series at a low price, I would say it is money well-spent.

5736162,5,B00CRVL5WC,Very good job on everything . The product came quicker than I thought and was in perfect condition. I highly recommend this seller to anyone out there.,1284768000,,151,4.62962962962963
5736163,5,B00CRVL5WC,I just did the math and it is cheaper to buy them separately and even cheaper to buy season one and 2 option then buy 3 and 4 separatley i thought packages were supposed to be cheaper but this option you will pay more unless there is something offered in this package that isn't in the separate option i suggest you buy them separately but I just got into this show and it is becoming one of my favorite shows,1270166400,19,409,4.125
5736164,5,B00CRVL5WC,"For years, I refused to watch My Name is Earl with the thought of more redneck humor. Over the holidays, my daughter talked me into watching this show. What I found was something I didn't expect, substance. Although the characters are rarely educated, they have heart. This show is about transformation. I am not talking about transformation into what a materialistic world calls success but an inner transformation. Earl changes from low-level criminal to compassion guru, Darnell is naturally caring, and even Joy has her moments of thoughtfulness. I would recommend My Name is Earl to anyone who is looking for escape with a touch of meaning.",1266451200,30,645,5.037383177570093

5736212,5,B00CRVL5WC,"My Name Is Earl had a great core of main characters and Earl's list was genius because it always brought in new characters
that kept it fresh. It also had great revolving side characters.
Hollywood sometimes is overly dramatic about the whole ""redneck"" or ""hick"" or ""small town"" character, but they did a great job here.
This show was cut way too soon, it could have ran for at least four or five more seasons.
Please search for the bring back My name is Earl petition and sign it.
This is one Netflix needs to bring back if NBC doesn't.
I advise buying this and at the moment its on Netflix, but you know they don't leave shows on forever.",1483747200,,640,4.341666666666667
