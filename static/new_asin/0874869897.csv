171702,5,0874869897,"""She Said Yes"" is an extraordinary video.  It is a touching tribute to the martyr Cassie Bernall. She was a daughter, a friend, but most of all she was a teenager.  This video gives a wonderful insight on  the struggles and victories a Christian has.  It's a great video for  parents, teens, and Youth Group meetings.  If you are thinking of  purchasing this video I strongly recommend you do so.  It is money well  spent.  The reaction and out-look you will have on a Christian life will be  totally changed.  So don't wait....Buy your copy today!",946598400,9,548,4.59375
171703,1,0874869897,"I strongly recommend that anyone who sees this movie consider it fiction.  As more and more evidence is showing, it was the person next to Cassie that said ""Yes"", not Cassie herself.  If you want to see a movie  that shows how a young woman was emotionally abused by her parents  ""tough love"" philosophy before she was tragically and senselessly  slain, get it.  If you want inspirational stories of faith, you're better  off reading C.S. Lewis, than seeing this sad attempt to capitalize on this  poor young woman's death.  Her parents should be ashamed of themselves,  but they're too busy selling their daughter's fictional  ""martyrdom"" to those willing to believe this fiction over the  truth.",944697600,7,697,4.965217391304348
171704,4,0874869897,"Beginning with the news footage of that fateful day, this video portrays in a sensitive way the tragedy that touched our nation, and one particular girl's life.  I found it to be a moving and powerful video that inspires us  to live our lives more fully.",940377600,12,254,4.5

7793259,4,0874869897,"Overall, the video was great.  The beginning with actual footage of Columbine was strong.  However, the end of the video lost some teens' attentions.  Overall, I am glad I purchased the product.",1292457600,,194,5.0
7793260,1,0874869897,"I notice that the two positive reviews at the very top contain similar language-""if you know a teen, or love a teen...""
This video, the book, and the t-shirts are all worthless, and any money you pay for them is going to help Cassie's parents profit from their daughter's death. There are better ways to get kids into Christianity than telling them lies, they'll either grow up deluded or resentful if you do.
Testimony of eyewitnesses suggests that all the killers said to Cassie was ""Peekaboo"" before shooting her, while Valeen Schnurr (after she was shot) was asked if she believed in God-said yes-and was able to recover later on. That's inspirational enough, thank you, and no money goes to the vultures Cassie's parents have made themselves into. (...)",1085270400,3,758,4.883720930232558
7793261,5,0874869897,"Emily Wyant's assertion that Cassie's exchange with her killer never happened is disputed by other survivors of the library who continue to stand by their initial accounts. In addition, ballistic reports confirm that it was Harris, not the jewish Klebold, who shot Cassie, therefore proving the inaccuracy of Emily's testimony. Emily apparently suffered greatly from PST(post-traumatic stress disorder), and her recollections of events were effected as a result.
Other issues involve why the Jefferson County Sheriff's office hid video testimony that showed anti-Christian hatred and murderous threats by the 2 killers, and why they allowed Salon.com reporters access to private information about Cassie, while none of the other victim's information was released. Furthermore, the Salon.com article which tried to ""debunk"" Cassie's testimony in death coincided with the release of this book. The sheriff's department tried to make it look as though the two killers were targeting athletes, when in fact, most of the victims were Christians. The killers did not ask their victims ""Are you are athlete?"", but rather ""Do you believe in God?"".
I find the testimony of Cassie to be a wonderful example of faith, and she should be honored by Christians as a heroic example of faith.",992476800,10,1276,5.385
7793262,4,0874869897,"This past summer, the summer of 2000, I along with some helpers put on a retreat for teenagers ranging in age from 13-18.  The retreat was for introductory teens (teens that wanted to take a step towards Christ in there life) so I felt that this video would have been appropriate for them to view.  I did show it to them and explained the premise and basis for the documentary and the reaction that they showed was amazing.  I also work with inner-city kids and have shown the video to them and we had the most heartfelt and spiritual discussion with them over this topic and video.  I think it is a great video to own and I encourage anyone thinking about purchasing it to do so.",974160000,,680,4.330708661417323
7793263,5,0874869897,"This was a great video.  it really touched most of our youth in our meeting, and it showed them the reallity of life.  we gave an invatation after the movie with a small message, and it was the most respond we have ever got for an invatation.  Praise God! put a lot of prayer befor the meeting, and God will show his work.",972777600,,322,4.079365079365079
7793264,5,0874869897,"I have read the book and watched the video.  Both of them have brought tears to my eyes.  I'm only 13 but I know that God is the way to go.  Just finding out and getting to know more about Cassie Bernall and her last  word, ""Yes,"" has led me closer to God.  It has also thickened my  relationship with him.",963792000,2,306,3.9344262295081966
7793265,5,0874869897,"I recently used this video with the youth group in my church.  It was an excellent tool in helping these young people see that Cassie was an ordinary teenager, just like them who had extrordianary faith in her God.  They were all touched by her story and her strong faith and belief.  Several went on to read the book and I have seen great changes in their  lives in a very short time.  It is a wonderful thing to have a video like  this to use with young people when there are so many negitive things being  said about them today.  I personally recommend this video to anyone who  works with young people or is ministering to them.",959299200,4,632,4.288135593220339

7793267,2,0874869897,"This video is a tribute . . . nothing more. It was put together by Cassie's youth group and thus only shows her ""christian"" friends. I think it would have been better if they had interviewed some of the  people in the book who weren't christians. It would have painted a more  accurate picture. (I am a Cristian, BTW.)
I -- for one -- am getting sick  of the ongoing debate on this webite review section (and elsewhere) as to  wether she did indeed say yes or not, because (1) this isn't the place for  it, and (2) in the grand sceme of things, it doesn't really matter if she  actually did or not; If you have read the book, saw the video, or read any  of the other articles about her, you'd know that regardless of wether she  was actually given The Question by Dylan Kleibold, she would have, and (3)  the book isn't really about that. It's about how the Holy Spirit changed  her life.
Please stop attacking Misty and Brad. I'm sure they'd gladly  give up anything they've made for just one more hour with Cassie. If they  proffit at all (which I don't think they do), they've paid for it with  their dearest blood.
For the record, I _do_ believe that she said yes,  based upon all of ths sources that I have read. However, I reserve  judgement in the cases of Val and Rachel. I simply don't know enough about  them.
As for the video, it is advertized as a youth group discussuion  starter. I would respectfully disagree. As an Asst Youth Director myself, I  wouldn't use it with my group unless they had all read the book or I had  taken the time to explain a lot about it.
The video itself is mediocre  because the production team didn't even put in subtitles to tell us who  these people are. We have to guess from what they say.  Also, I would have  made it a little longer and put the video for Michael W Smith's song  ""This Is Your Time"" on the end. It has a nice soundtrack from  They Kry and Second Chapter of John, however and viewers see a lot of  intimate family photos and home video footage -- including some filemd 2  days before she died where she talked about her faith.
I loved the book  (I've read it about 5-6 times), but this video is only really usable as a  companion to the book.",954028800,5,2205,4.258454106280193
