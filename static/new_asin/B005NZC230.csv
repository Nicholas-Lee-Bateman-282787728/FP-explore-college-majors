8480838,2,B005NZC230,"I've been a KS fan for years, loving their impeccable harmonies, intonation, diction, charisma, audience-pleasing performances, and delightful British wit. I own all their recordings, video and DVDs, and have been to many live performances. Their two previous DVDs: ""From Byrd to the Beatles"" in 2005 and ""the BBC Proms"" in 2008 are spectacularly wonderful and a treat for the eyes and ears. They were recorded live, in front of an enthusiastic audience, in gorgeous venues. The KS were impeccably attired and they performed with a spirit of thrilling excitement. Naturally, I couldn't wait to buy their latest Christmas DVD. What a letdown! It was if if their standards took a nosedive. First of all, it was recorded in a studio setting that looked very industrial with really bad lighting and a distracting, ugly, makeshift stage with a skirt upon which the KS stood for several songs. The singing, although beautifully and characteristically harmonious, was delivered in a lackluster, tired manner, perhaps because there was no audience to motivate them. The set decorations looked like they were dragged in from a second hand store. When not standing on the makeshift stage, they were positioned around a tacky, fake, miniature Christmas tree attired in an unattractive assortment of ill-fitting scarves, coats and jackets which completely distracted me from what they were singing. They group just seemed bored with the whole endeavor. And the segment where they had Johnny, the bass, try some dance moves was truly painful to watch. In fact, the whole DVD was painful to watch. I'm so very disappointed.",1324166400,3,1609,5.168582375478927
