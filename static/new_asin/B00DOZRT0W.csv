5839329,5,B00DOZRT0W,"The original film, ""The Snowman"" is a family treasure that I have enjoyed since childhood. My brother and I were thrilled when we found that a new movie had come out. The second film was artfully crafted and just as magical. I really enjoyed having The Snowman back in my living room once more, only this time as an adult (don't tell my brother I watched it without him). It's a modern day approach to the first edition. I did especially appreciate the extended footage with interviews from the original creator and author, Raymond Briggs, it gave a look into his life and why his stories are touching, yet heartbreaking.",1448755200,2,621,4.654545454545454

5839333,2,B00DOZRT0W,"The art and animation in this film are simply beautiful, and I suppose it could be said that the story is typical of its day and age, but the truly disappointing part is the simply AWFUL musical accompaniment. There is a most interesting account of the conception of the sequel on Wikipedia, and evidently the composer of the music to the original Snowman, Howard Blake, was not invited back to provide the music for the sequel, and was in fact treated insultingly. The music that does accompany the film is tacky rock-n-roll type music that not only doesn't add to the film, but actually takes away from what could be a fairly charming sequel. What a pity! How could the filmmakers spend so much money and time and allow the whole thing to be compromised by such substandard music? Could have been a rather successful sequel, but misses the boat. I imagine Raymond Briggs must be quite disappointed by the desecration of his beautiful original work.",1437004800,3,950,4.728915662650603

5839337,5,B00DOZRT0W,"Both my parents and I LOVE ""The Snowman"".  It's such a simple, charming, magical story, that's beautifully animated, and we've watched it every year since the time it was released. So when we learned the cherished movie was getting a sequel to celebrate the 20th anniversary, we were both excited, as well as cautious, because with any sequel, there's the lingering fear that it won't be as good as the first, or worse, ruin the original.

But after watching it, I can easily say this sequel is just as good as the original, with the same quality animation, and the same level of magic and heart.

Just like the original, the story is told with no dialogue, and centers on a young boy who moves into a new neighborhood, and into the house that the boy from the original lived in. Clearly, many years have passed, and the barren countryside has since been renovated and filled up with many more houses.  Come wintertime, the boy discovers an old shoebox under the floorboards in his bedroom.  Inside is a time capsule of sorts, filled with some of the boy from the original's old toys, as well as a picture of him with the titular Snowman (and the hat and scarf that was used).  The boy (from now) uses the photo as a reference to rebuild the Snowman, and uses any extra snow to build a snow dog as well (in memory of his real dog that passed away early on in the movie).  At the stroke of midnight, both the Snowman and the Snowdog come to life, and take the boy on a memorable flight to the North Pole to meet Santa Claus.  And come the next morning, although the boy must bid the Snowman a sad goodbye, a little Christmas magic gifts him one last surprise.

Clearly, the team that worked on this movie were big fans of the first ""Snowman"", and put ALOT of heart, soul, and effort into this production. Just like the original, it's traditionally animated with colored pencil (a process that must've been painstaking to put together), but the work shows, for the animation is utterly beautiful, and I really can't see The Snowman being drawn any other way.  And much like the first movie's ""Walking in the Air"" flying sequence, we get a similar montage set to an equally magical song, ""Light the Night"".  I've come to love both songs equally, as each one is evoking a different sort of mood. ""Walking in the Air"" was meant to be calm and haunting, while ""Light the Night"" is much more cheery and upbeat, but comes off just as powerful.

While the DVD special features are pretty sparse, there IS a very long, but very interesting documentary about the making of the movie, that doubles as a biography of ""Snowman"" creator, Raymond Briggs. I highly recommend watching it, as his story is both sad at times, as well as uplifting, and to hear that the animators went to him first to gain his approval of making the sequel just goes to show how much respect they have for him and the original movie.

So, if you're a fan of the first ""Snowman"", this sequel is definitely a MUST watch. It remains faithful to the original movie and pays homage to it at times, while also keeping its own originality.  Along with a beautiful new song, this is destined to become a new holiday classic.",1429920000,6,3178,4.4852686308492205

5839380,4,B00DOZRT0W,"Beautiful story...If you are familiar with 1982 ""The Snowman,"" my recommendation would be to watch this one first. Like the original, this sequel is a wonderful magical tale -- with a message appealing to kids and grownups too.  While both versions deal with loss, love and the special magic of the holidays, I would suggest viewers watch the 1982 ""The Snowman"" (five stars) AFTER this one. ""The Snowman and the Snowdog"" is sure to become a favorite after repeated viewings. However, I gave it 4 stars as the new music cannot compare to the music in the original. The song ""We're Walking In the Air""  in the 1982 flying sequence - is so ethereally haunting, it always moves my friends and family to tears when we watch it each year.

When I was a child, I loved watching the original 'Snowman' movie with my mom, which I've now shared with my children. And then last xmas, we came across this magical new sequel to the beloved classic. They both have their own beauty and magic, and equally beautiful soundtracks. The instrumental magic of storytelling with no words is amazing. I recommend the cd soundtracks as well. Wonderful to warm your soul on a cold winter evening, snuggled at home, while flying all over the sky with snowmen.

It's a family tradition in our house to watch The Snowman (the original) at least once every holiday season, though it usually ends up being more like 3 or 4 times.  We still love the original, but it was getting sort of stale after how many times we've watched it.  My sister, I, and my parents both were thrilled when we found that a sort of sequel came out, and it restored that sense of excitement we all had when we watched The Snowman for the first time ~15 years ago.

He was immediately mesmerized and now two months later, still watches The Snowman & The Snowdog daily. It's one of the few things he enjoys doing while sitting quietly. This was not written by the original author, but is seamless with The Snowman. It will remain a classic in our household for many many years to come. In fact, we had our first big snow in 10 years and he couldn't wait to go outside and build his own snowman and snowdog!",1393113600,,568,4.524271844660194

We have the Snowman on VHS and it is a kids' favorite. When the disc arrived and I found only the new story I was disappointed.  But the new story (set in the same house but forward in time) was so well done I had to let it go. The one flaw we saw was the ""updated"" music did not capture the amazing magic of the original's soundtrack during flying scenes.

I especially enjoyed the special feature, where the artistic team and Raymond Briggs interact.  It was nice to see the process of how this film was made (tons of work, by dedicated and very talented artists).  I was hesitant to buy it, believing that it would not measure up to the original, but I was wrong.  I highly recommend buying this to add the original adventure.",1390176000,,485,4.658823529411765

The story-line was real life for me because I was a single mom with a small son, and old dog .We also moved into a new home. Well, the old dog dies and they bury it in the back yard! All the time I am crying my eyes out. The story ends well but I don't know if I am up to showing it to my first grade class.

There are many good discussion possibilities and the whole video is delightful.  Keep kleenex handy... :-)",1389916800,2,356,4.348484848484849

The animation is first class and I was amazed to learn it was all done by hand as with the original. One would never know 30 years had passed since the original film. The score is as heartwarming as the original.. The ""song"" is not, though I can understand updating it for the present day. Still, this is the adventure of a boy, not a man. So why not have a child sing it?

The DVD extra ""making of"" is superior. Raymong Briggs is brilliant.

If you liked The Snowman, buy this one too. I also recommend The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child.",1389484800,2,762,4.198630136986301

I can understand why, the original is a very tough act to follow. However, this one is equally beautiful.

It starts out with their family dog dying and shows them burying it (doesn't show much detail about the death for the children, but it's still sad for sappy adults).

5839426,5,B00DOZRT0W,"This post was written for NCircle Entertainment who provided the DVDs for review and giveaway. I was not compensated in any way except for the DVD. My opinion is my own.  The Snowman and The Snowdog is the sequel to The Snowman (a book from 1978, and film from 1982), and was created to mark the 30th anniversary of the original short film.  Just like the original film, the story of The Snowman and The Snowdog is shown through animation and music, with no dialogue.  This sequel does a wonderful job of tying in the original story of James and his snowman that came to life; fans of the original The Snowman should keep their eyes peeled to note all the props and locations that are included in this sequel. In this story, Billy and his mother move into the same house James used to live in, and Billy discovers James' snowman kit under the floorboards.  When Billy builds his own snowman with the old kit, the magic still works and his snowman comes to life, this time with a snow dog as well.  Billy and his Snowman and Snowdog set off on a fun night of adventures, including meeting up with Father Christmas (Santa Claus) himself.  My daughter, having never seen the original The Snowman, nor having read either book, still thoroughly enjoyed The Snowman and The Snowdog.  I was afraid she'd be bored without any dialogue but she sat riveted throughout the show. The music is absolutely beautiful and works wonderfully with the story line.  The bonus material is a ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary and an interview with Raymond Briggs (author of the books).  This is a delightful family movie, perfect for the holidays and beyond.",1386547200,2,1634,4.645833333333333
5839427,5,B00DOZRT0W,"Beautiful movie! My kids 7 & 4 both loved it. Without the dialogue they were able to use their imagination and give the movie their own special twists. Its a nice, soothing pre-bedtime movie.",1386460800,2,191,4.647058823529412
5839428,5,B00DOZRT0W,"I found this DVD by accident rummaging through a bargain bin of Christmas films at K-Mart. I had no idea there was a sequel and my family and I are big fans of the original. It is a staple of our annual Christmas viewing. This sequel stays true to the original both visually and in it's use of beautifully moving music in lieu of dialog, though updated with some minor modern treatments that, thankfully, don't detract from the overall beauty of the film. Highly recommended.

Side note: where's the dad from the original? Divorced? Dead? At any rate, it is implied now that this is a single-parent family.",1385856000,,606,4.611111111111111
5839429,4,B00DOZRT0W,"My husband, 2 daughters/toddlers and I all really liked this film.  My husband and I even shed a few tears. I give it four and not a five for two reasons, one being the song during the flying scene is a little too busy, though still likable.  The flying scene and solo in the 1982 original was always my favorite part.  The flying song only would have dropped my rating to a 4.5, but  the second and biggest reason is that there are obnoxious (in my opinion) previews before the show that you have to sit through.  I loved the movie, but I felt uncomfortable with my 2 year old seeing the previews which can not yet understand or filter.  Now that we have watched it a few times she holds her ears and runs into the other room after the credits, as the previews comes on right afterward.",1385769600,3,787,4.248322147651007
5839430,5,B00DOZRT0W,"I got this DVD for my 4 year old son even though we've never seen the first one.  You don't really need to see the first one to enjoy this movie!  It's a very sweet story - without words - just lovely music.  A boy finds a box under the floorboard of his room that holds the Snowman's hat, scarf, nose and buttons and also a picture of a young boy and the Snowman.  So he gets the idea to build one for himself and now he's got all the parts!  And since he just lost his dog, he builds a Snowdog too for the Snowman.  It's a wonderful story of love and strength, friendship and adventure.  My son loved it.",1385510400,,606,3.958677685950413
5839431,5,B00DOZRT0W,"If you loved the original ""The Snowman"", then this poignant and charming sequel is certain to warm your heart. A young boy moves with his mother to a new home. There's a sad event but I won't spoil it for you; suffice to say that the young man discovers something under the floorboards in his bedroom - a snowman decorating kit! It starts snowing and the boy is off to make a snowman and on a whim, he make a snowdog too. Fans of the original will know that the boy is soon to experience something magical, and will be taking flight with the snowman and his new companion, the snowdog to a a far-off, magical land, where they play with other snowmen and get to experience a magical Christmas. The young boy discovers that dreams and wishes do come true, and all is well, as it should be this magical time of year.

This makes the perfect stocking stuffer for Christmas, and my 8.5-year-old daughter and I truly enjoyed the show. It runs about 70 mins, and like the original contains no dialogue, just a wonderful accompanying soundtrack that brings to mind delightful holiday memories. There's bonus features such as a behind the scenes documentary and an interview with Raymond Briggs.

My kids don't watch just anything, so when I saw all the great review on this title, I though fantastic something to add in our collection. Well, the one thing I didn't know is that right from the start the movie begins with the mom and boy moving to a new house. They have a dog. My kids right away said why is the dog looking so sad? I said, I don't know maybe he is old, anyway, 1 min. later they are buring the dog in their backyard. My 6 years old couldn't get pass that, he just wept and I had to stop the movie. If I had known this prior to make the purchase (I found it at Target for the same price) I wouldn't have bought it. They've asked me to return it, that this is just way too sad and they don't ever want to see it again. the story in the long run might be good, but you sure have to pass that first event.",1384732800,16,883,3.857142857142857
